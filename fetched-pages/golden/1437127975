News Scientist: Don&#39;t Trust Sunscreen Fri May 11, 9:50 AM ET The latest skin-cancer prevention advice is to stop trusting sunscreen as the front line of defense against harmful rays. Instead, wear sunblocking clothing or stay out of the sun altogether, experts say. Sunscreen has been shown to protect against UV skin damage as well as basal carcinomas and squamous cell carcinoma&mdash;two of the three most common skin cancers . However, it has not been conclusively shown to protect against , the most fatal kind, said Stephan Lautenschlager of the Outpatient Clinic of Dermatology at Triemli Hospital in Switzerland. Lautenschlager and his colleagues carried out a comprehensive review on worldwide, recently detailed online in the journal Lancet. "Wearing sun-protective clothing and a hat and reducing sun exposure to a minimum should be preferred to sunscreens," Lautenschlager said. People tend to sunbathe for social reasons, he said. "Nevertheless, sunscreens should not be abused in an attempt to increase time in the sun to a maximum." The best clothing for sun protection is tightly woven, thick garments made of denim, wool or polyester, not cotton, linen or acetate, he said. Dry material or clothes that have shrunk after washing are denser and better at blocking UV rays than wet, stretched or bleached clothing. Outdoors, wear sunscreen and lots of it. Zinc or titanium oxide sunscreens scatter UV light and yield fewer allergies, so they are better for children, he said. The more common sunscreen lotions, called organic sunscreens, absorb UV rays. "The application of a liberal quantity of sunscreen is by far the most important factor for effectiveness of the sunscreen, followed by the uniformity of application and the specific absorption spectrum of the agent used," Lautenschlager said. That is, don&#39;t treat the stuff like liquid gold. Smear it on. A shot glass-full should be applied 15 to 30 minutes before heading outdoors. Look at your skin While four out of five people are concerned about skin , more than half have never been screened for skin cancer (54 percent) and nearly one quarter (23 percent) never examine their skin for changes to moles and blemishes, according to a recent survey by the American Academy of Dermatology. More than 1 million new cases of skin cancer will be diagnosed this year, the AAD says, but when detected early, even To check yourself, regular inspect all your skin, including the back, scalp, buttocks, soles of the feet, between the toes and the palms of the hands. Use mirrors when necessary. Other tips from the AAD: Seek shade if you must be outdoors during the sun&#39;s strongest hours, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Avoid .

News Gene switch helps mice fix their own broken hearts Thu May 10, 4:37 PM ET CHICAGO (Reuters) - Researchers have figured out how to switch on a gene in adult mice that repaired their hearts after a heart attack, a finding that may one day help fix heart damage in humans. The team at Columbia University Medical Center in New York found that by genetically manipulating a gene associated with cell growth, adult mice were able to make new cells to replace those damaged in a heart attack. Heart cells in mice, and in humans, stop regenerating after birth. If the heart is damaged by a heart attack, it cannot create new cells to repair the damage and hearts become less efficient at pumping blood. "Heart cells don&#39;t divide at all in the mammal heart, and that&#39;s why we have so much mortality and morbidity," said Dr. Hina Chaudhry, whose study appears in the journal Circulation Research. Chaudhry and colleagues studied the gene cyclin A2, a gene that is active in embryos, but shut off in adult mammals. "We genetically engineered these mice to keep expressing this gene that becomes silent after birth," she said in a telephone interview. The researchers then induced a heart attack in the mice. At three months, the mice whose cyclin A2 genes had been switched on had 77 percent better heart function than the other mice. "The mice who did not carry the gene were progressing to heart failure and dying," she said. "We didn&#39;t lose any of the mice that carried the gene. They had much better survival." "We&#39;re the first study to show a sustained improvement in cardiac function by any kind of molecular or cellular manipulation," she said. Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in people older than 65, a condition that affects nearly 5 million Americans. Chaudhry said the approach needed to be tested in larger mammals and then in humans, something she believes is not too far off.

News U.S. divorce rate lowest since 1970 By DAVID CRARY, AP National Writer Thu May 10, 2:43 PM ET NEW YORK - By the numbers, divorce just isn't what it used to be. Despite the common notion that America remains plagued by a divorce epidemic, the national per capita divorce rate has declined steadily since its peak in 1981 and is now at its lowest level since 1970. Yet Americans aren't necessarily making better choices about their long-term relationships. Even those who study marriage and work to make it more successful can't decide whether the trend is grounds for celebration or cynicism. Some experts say relationships are as unstable as ever &#151; and divorces are down primarily because more couples live together without marrying. Other researchers have documented what they call "the divorce divide," contending that divorce rates are indeed falling substantively among college-educated couples but not among less-affluent, less-educated couples. "Families with two earners with good jobs have seen an improvement in their standard of living, which leads to less tension at home and lower probability of divorce," said Andrew Cherlin, a professor of public policy at Johns Hopkins University. America's divorce rate began climbing in the late 1960s and skyrocketed during the '70s and early '80s, as virtually every state adopted no-fault divorce laws. The rate peaked at 5.3 divorces per 1,000 people in 1981. But since then it's dropped by one-third, to 3.6. That's the lowest rate since 1970. What's fueling that decline? According to 20 scholars, marriage-promotion experts and divorce lawyers consulted by The Associated Press, a combination of things. The number of couples who live together without marrying has increased tenfold since 1960; the marriage rate has dropped by nearly 30 percent in past 25 years; and Americans are waiting about five years longer to marry than they did in 1970. Adding such factors together, Patrick Fagan of the conservative Heritage Foundation sees a bad situation. "Cohabitation is very fragile, and when unmarried parents split, for the child it might as well be a divorce," Fagan said. "Among those who are marrying there's increased stability, but overall the children of the nation are getting a rawer and rawer deal from their parents." Other experts, however, are heartened by what they view as the increased determination of many couples to make marriage work. Among them is Bill Chausee of Child and Family Services of New Hampshire, which offers marriage-strengthening programs in a state where divorces dropped more than 25 percent between 2000 and 2005. "People don't see marriage problems as some sort of stigma any more," said Chausee. "They're really interested in learning how to stay married; a lot of them are realizing they need more skill." Some states have made concerted efforts to combat divorce with publicly funded marriage education campaigns, although their effectiveness remains in question. In Oklahoma, 100,000 people have attended workshops since a marriage initiative began in 2001, but the latest divorce figures showed no drop, and the campaign's backers no long stress their original goal of cutting divorce by one-third by 2010. Wayne and Carol Sutton are among the couples who've gone to Oklahoma's marriage workshops; they attended a half-dozen sessions earlier this year in their hometown of Tulsa. "This was a way to gain some insight," said Wayne Sutton, a longtime petroleum engineer whose wife also works in the energy industry. "They tell you to regenerate the closeness you had when you got married." Sutton, 51, and his wife, 46, married in 1995 and have a 9-year-old son. "We're like any marriage," he said. "We've had rocky periods and Cloud Nine periods. ... We decided a long time ago were not going to desert each other; we were going to stay together no matter what." The Bush administration believes such programs have merit &#151; its Healthy Marriage initiative has disbursed more than $200 million nationwide in the past five years. Bill Coffin, the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Health and Human Services ' special assistant for marriage education, is convinced the programs are a factor in the declining divorce rate. "The word is getting out that marriage doesn't have to be a crap shoot &#151; it's not the luck of the draw," Coffin said. "It's how you deal with the inevitable conflict and anger in marriage." He subscribes to the theory that better-educated, wealthier couples have better odds of success in marriage. "What we're doing is making sure the poor have access to some help and support," Coffin said. "So many people never heard of marriage education before." One of the researchers whose studies detected the "divorce divide" is University of Maryland sociologist Steve Martin. Comparing marriages from early 1970s to those of the early '90s, Martin found that the rate of breakups within 10 years of marriage dropped by one-third among college-educated women while remaining stable among less-educated women. "Overall, marriages will become more stable only if the lower two-thirds of the population starts behaving like the top third," Martin said. "There's a lot of debate &#151; is that possible? Can marriage training or other programs give all couples the sort of relationship skills that people imagine college graduates have?" Stephanie Coontz, who teaches history and family studies at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., says divorces are dropping in the college-educated sector because many spouses "are learning how to negotiate marriages based on less rigid gender roles than in the past." "College-educated wives are more likely to work than less-educated wives, and a recent study found that unlike the past, a wife's work now tends to stabilize marriage," she said. Glenn Stanton, a family policy expert with the conservative ministry Focus on the Family, suggested one factor behind the declining divorce rate was simply a societal revulsion toward the high rates of recent decades. "In the past 30 years, we've had more divorce than any culture has ever had," he said. "A lot of young adults now are coming out of the family upheaval of the '70s, and they are cohabiting out of fear. They don't want to mess up the nice clean carpet of marriage &#151; they saw their parents do that." Amber Settle and her partner, Andre Berthiaume, are among the couples who have opted not to marry, even as they celebrate 10 years of living together and raise a 3-year-old daughter in Chicago. Each teaches computer science at DePaul University, each is 39, each has parents who divorced. "We decided a long time ago that marriage wasn't for us," Settle said. "We have a number of friends who got married, and we've supported them. But it's not something we want to do." Among their reasons, she said, was their belief it would be unfair to get married until same-sex couples across the country had the same opportunity. Observing her married friends, Settle sees some wonderful relationships and some on the rocks. Married or cohabiting, she said, "you have to work hard at a relationship to make it work." The per capita divorce rate is different from another method of calculation &#151; the percentage of marriages that will eventually end in divorce or separation. Many experts discount the popular notion that one of two U.S. marriages end in divorce, and suggest the breakup rate, which is hard to calculate, has stabilized in recent years at between 40 percent and 45 percent. Gaetano Ferro of New Canaan, Conn., president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, says overall national trends haven't had a noticeable effect on his fellow divorce lawyers. "I've been active in the academy two decades plus," Ferro said. "I've never heard anyone say, 'We're in trouble. There are fewer divorces.'" But North Carolina divorce lawyer Lee Rosen, while reporting that business for his large firm is booming, says he has noticed a trend toward increased realism and civility among couples with marital strains. Many seek mediation as they split, and arrange for joint legal custody of their children. "People are coexisting more peacefully, whether they stay together or come apart," Rosen said. "They are more contemplative and serious about their relationships, and I see people stay together who once would have allowed the marriage to unravel." Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News LEDs emerge to fight fluorescents By PETER SVENSSON, AP Technology Writer Fri May 11, 2:52 PM ET NEW YORK - The light bulb, the symbol of bright ideas, doesn't look like such a great idea anymore, as lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad are talking about banning the century-old technology because of its contribution to global warming. But what comes next? Compact fluorescent bulbs are the only real alternative right now, but "bulbs" that use light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, are quickly emerging as a challenger. LEDs, which are small chips usually encased in a glass dome the size of a matchstick head, have been in use in electronics for decades to indicate, for example, whether a VCR is on or off. Those LEDs were usually red or green, but a scientific breakthrough in the 1990s paved the way for the production of LEDs that produce white light. Because they use less power than standard incandescent bulbs, white LEDs have become common in flashlights. Established players in the lighting industry and a host of startups are now grooming LEDs to take on the reigning champion of residential lighting, the familiar pear-shaped incandescent light bulb. The light bulb has been running out of friends recently. California and Canada have decided to ban the sale of incandescent bulbs by 2012. Australia is banning them in 2010. The is looking at banning production of the bulbs. A U.S. Senate committee is working on a proposal that would phase out the light bulb in 10 years. And in New Jersey, where the first practical incandescent bulb emerged from Thomas Edison's laboratory in 1879, a bill has been introduced to ban their use in government buildings. Governments are gunning for the light bulb because it's much less efficient than fluorescents, using about five times more energy to produce the same amount of light. Lighting consumes 22 percent of electricity produced in the U.S., according to the , and widespread use of LED lighting could cut consumption in half. By 2027, LED lighting could cut annual energy use by the equivalent of 500 million barrels of oil, with the attendant reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas believed to be responsible for global warming. Much of that reduction would be possible with today's technology, using compact fluorescents, or CFLs. But consumers haven't warmed to them. The light quality hasn't been satisfactory, most take time to turn on and aren't dimmable. The LED has advantages over the CFL in most of those areas, and judging by this week's Lightfair trade show in New York, it could be a serious challenge to the CFL in a few years. What holds it back is chiefly price, but LEDs are already an economic alternative for niche uses. In the last two years, the diodes have doubled in energy efficiency and brightness, according to Greg Merritt, director of marketing for Durham, N.C.-based LED-manufacturer Cree Inc. In particular, LEDs that produce a yellowish or "warm" light similar to incandescents have improved. Dallas-based Lighting Science Group Corp. showed an LED "bulb" that screws into a standard medium-sized socket and produces a warm light equivalent to that of a 25-watt incandescent bulb, but consumes just 5.8 watts. It costs $50, hardly palatable to consumers who can buy a standard bulb for less than a dollar. Polybrite International, a startup in Naperville, Ill., announced that lighting giant Osram Sylvania, a subsidiary of Germany's Siemens AG, will distribute its LED "bulbs." The intended market is mainly commercial clients, who can afford to pay $15 to $85 per unit, according to Osram Sylvania marketing manager Constance Pineault. The energy efficiency is no doubt a draw for commercial clients like hotels, but LEDs have another big advantage: they last up to 50,000 hours, according to manufacturers. That compares to about 10,000 hours for fluorescents and 1,000 hours for incandescents. Not having to send out janitors to replace burned-out bulbs means big savings in maintenance costs. "Right now the applications that make sense are either high maintenance or high power consumption, like parking garages, where the lights are on all the time," said Cree's Merritt. LEDs already beat fluorescents for energy efficiency in some niche uses. For instance, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is putting LED lighting in its in-store refrigerators, where the cold dims fluorescents and incandescents produce too much heat. LEDs also starting to replace flat fluorescent backlights in liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs, where they produce better colors. LEDs don't contain toxic mercury, which CFLs do, though the amount is very small. (Recent stories circulating on the Web about calling a hazmat team if a CFL breaks are exaggerated. The U.S. recommends sweeping up, not vacuuming, the fragments, then checking out local recycling options.) The cost of LED lighting should be coming down quickly. Polybrite founder Carl Scianna said the cost of individual white-light diodes, several of which go into an LED bulb and make up much of the cost, have come down in price from about $8 to $1.50 in a year. "They're going to keep going down," Scianna said. "By the middle of next year, they'll be priced for consumers." Nadarajah Narendran, director of lighting research at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., cautions that there are still technical issues to work out with LEDs. While single LEDs can demonstrate very high energy efficiency in the lab, when they're combined into fixtures, their efficiency is considerably lower. In part that's a heat issue: the diodes produce less heat than incandescents, but they keep that heat in the fixture rather than radiating it, and the hotter the diodes get, the less efficient they are. He sees screwing LED bulbs into standard sockets "as a waste of talent" that doesn't utilize the inherent properties of LEDs, like their small size and longevity. "You could build them in as part of the furniture, part of the cabinetry," Narendran said. Because of their high prices, he doesn't believe LEDs will be ready to replace incandescents in all their uses for the next five to 10 years, but "LEDs, good or bad, will be growing very rapidly."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070510/us_nm/studentloans_world_dc	College cost crunch felt worldwide, not just in U.S. - Yahoo! News College cost crunch felt worldwide, not just in U.S. Thu May 10, 11:39 AM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A college cost crunch is bearing down on governments worldwide -- not just in America -- and some innovative approaches to student loans are being taken overseas, although you wouldn&#39;t know it on Capitol Hill. As another round of debate gets going in Congress on how to help debt-burdened university students, aides said lawmakers were largely ignoring how other countries do it. One approach being taken in Australia and New Zealand, for instance, is the wider use of "income-contingent" loans that base post-graduation repayments on a borrower&#39;s income. Most U.S. student loans still base repayments on the loan size. Britain makes income-contingent loans as well, with students repaying them through the tax system to The Student Loan Co. Ltd., a government organization. In Canada, student loans have been centralized under the government, which hires a services provider, largely removing banks from the picture, said Leesha Lin, operational policy and research director at the Canada Student Loans Program. "The service was not very good with the banks. A lot of students complained," Lin said in an interview. Norway monitors student performance and rewards diligence by converting portions of loans into grants that need not be repaid upon satisfactory completion of a course of study. "Very useful and important things are happening in other countries," said Robert Shireman, executive director of the Project on Student Debt, a group that aims to improve America&#39;s labyrinthine and politically sensitive student loan system. But getting U.S. lawmakers to look abroad for ideas is hard. "It&#39;s fascinating how insular Americans are. Discussions of what happens in other countries fall flat," Shireman said. In the private sector, of course, that is not the case. Just ask Sallie Mae, the largest U.S. student loan group and a major target of congressional reformers&#39; zeal. The company last week announced its first foreign venture -- a loan program targeting British post-graduate students. "We&#39;re watching these markets very carefully," said Lynn Ross, vice president of international lending for Sallie Mae. As in America, higher education costs are hammering other developed nations, forcing a reassessment of who pays and how. In much of Europe, a "free" university education -- meaning one paid for by taxpayers and not students or their families -- was seen for decades as a basic right. No longer. Britain in the late 1990s became the first European country to impose more than a nominal university tuition fee. Today, UK tuition is capped at about &#36;6,000 a year for full-time students who started school last autumn. That is still cheap by U.S. standards, but costly compared to most systems. Following the UK example, tuition is being imposed for the first time in other countries, including in Germany this year. German banks -- including Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank -- have begun offering student loans meant to supplement loans from government-owned banks. "Student loans are becoming more and more important in Germany," said Markus Langer, a project manager at German university consultancy CHE Consult. Even in China and former Communist countries where a free college education was once politically sacred, students now pay fees, and many take out loans to make ends meet. U.S. COLLEGE COSTS TOPS With the world&#39;s most expensive higher education system, America asks students to pay an average of &#36;5,800 a year in tuition to attend a four-year public university; or an average of &#36;22,200 a year for a private four-year school, according to the College Board, an educational testing and services group. America&#39;s decentralized and competitive higher education system is a global leader, with many of the world&#39;s best and brightest students beating a path to U.S. universities. But for middle-class U.S. voters, college costs are a major anxiety, especially this time of year with college admission letters arriving and financial aid application deadlines near. U.S. students must navigate a bewildering array of financial aid programs. Besides scholarships and grants that don&#39;t have to be repaid, students can borrow directly from the government; from banks through federally guaranteed private loans; or, increasingly, from banks with no federal guarantee. Income-contingent repayment is available to some U.S. students with federal government loans, but Shireman&#39;s group has said the program is too limited and too complex. Concern is growing about student debt. Typical undergraduates leave school today owing about &#36;20,000 -- a burden that can limit a young person&#39;s choices in life. Especially worrying to some is students&#39; increasing reliance on bank debt, which now accounts for 20 percent of student loans, up from 7 percent just 10 years ago. Congressional Democrats have introduced legislation that would cut college loan interest rates, raise grant funding, and steer more students toward direct government loans, which they argue save money for students and taxpayers. The banks and Sallie Mae dispute this, arguing that their loans are cost-efficient and bring student and schools an array of helpful financial services. The two sides have been fighting over the issue for so many years now that some of the latest thinking in student loans has already moved on, particularly overseas. "The debate does suffer in that way," Shireman said. Bush admin: college student aid system broken Reuters via Yahoo! News, May 11 Spellings faces student loan questions AP via Yahoo!

News Landis: USADA wanted to get to Armstrong By EDDIE PELLS, AP National Writer Fri May 11, 6:32 AM ET Floyd Landis claims the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's lead attorney approached his lawyer offering "the shortest suspension they'd ever given an athlete" if Landis provided information that implicated Lance Armstrong for doping. Landis said he made the Armstrong allegations public Thursday not because he planned to use it as evidence when testimony begins Monday in his arbitration hearing, but to show the lengths USADA will go to in prosecuting athletes. "It was offensive at best," Landis said during a teleconference from Los Angeles. "It speaks to the character of the prosecution." The 2006 Tour de France champion said USADA general counsel Travis Tygart approached his attorney, Howard Jacobs, with a deal shortly after learning of Landis' positive doping test during the Tour. He said Jacobs characterized the conversation as one in which USADA would offer a deal if Landis passed on information about seven-time Tour champion Armstrong "or information about someone more important than me." Over the years, Armstrong has fought doping allegations that have never been proven. As for what he told Jacobs when the attorney passed on the information: "I don't think that offer justified a response," Landis said. Jacobs did not immediately return messages left at his office by The Associated Press, and Tygart held to USADA's restriction on commenting about ongoing cases. "If Mr. Landis will waive the rule and allow me to comment, then I'll be happy to address his nonsense," Tygart said. USADA has a history of reducing penalties for athletes who provide evidence of doping violations by other athletes, though asking for information about specific athletes is not allowed. Landis faces a two-year suspension and forfeiture of his title if his positive test is upheld. Armstrong and Landis are former teammates who went through an unfriendly split in 2004, but Armstrong has publicly supported Landis and been an outspoken critic of the way anti-doping agencies do business. "I believe in Floyd, I believe he hasn't had a fair shake," Armstrong said recently. The Armstrong revelation was the latest in a string of allegations Landis has levied against USADA and anti-doping authorities as he puts the final touches on his defense. Over the past several months, he has toured the country to drum up support and money for his defense. He says the leak of the positive doping test last July damaged his reputation, and he's not even sure a victory in arbitration will repair all that.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/pope_brazil	Pope canonizes first Brazilian saint - Yahoo! News Pope canonizes first Brazilian saint By VICTOR L. SIMPSON, Associated Press Writer SAO PAULO, Brazil - castigated popular culture for promoting sexual immorality Friday as he canonized Brazil's first native-born saint before hundreds of thousands of faithful and a sea of flags in the world's largest Roman Catholic nation. Holding up Friar Antonio de Sant'Anna Galvao as a model of rectitude and humility "in an age so full of hedonism," Benedict said the world needs clear souls and pure minds, adding: "It is necessary to oppose those elements of the media that ridicule the sanctity of marriage and virginity before marriage." Benedict didn't elaborate, but his message for Brazilian Catholics reflected his uneasiness with the impact of popular culture on young people. Earlier this year, Benedict declared that "any trend to produce programs and products &#151; including animated films and video games &#151; which in the name of entertainment exalt violence and portray anti-social behavior or the trivialization of human sexuality is a perversion." Later, meeting with the country's 430 bishop's in Sao Paulo's cathedral, Benedict lamented that Brazil is in the midst of "difficult times for the church" amid "aggressive proselytizing" by born-again Protestant congregations. The census says the percentage of Brazilians characterizing themselves as Catholics dropped from 89 percent in 1980 to 74 percent in 2000, while those calling themselves evangelical Protestants rose from 7 percent to 15 percent. Benedict's message on immorality could be a tough sell in hedonistic Brazil. Sex before marriage is common. Scantily clad actresses are the norm on hugely popular TV soap operas, and most women on Brazil's famed beaches wear bikinis that leave so little to the imagination. "Nothing could be more countercultural than his message in Brazil, the land of the thong," said David Gibson, author of "The Rule of Benedict: Pope Benedict XVI and His Battle with the Modern World." Brazilian news media said the crowd reached about 1 million &#151; as church officials had hoped for &#151; although there were large empty spaces on the airfield in South America's largest city. Benedict pronounced the sainthood of Galvao, a Franciscan monk credited by the church with 5,000 miracle cures, while he sat on a throne of Brazilian hardwood, surrounded by Latin American bishops and choirs of hundreds. Galvao is the first native-born saint from Brazil, home to more than 120 million of the planet's 1.1 billion Catholics, and the 10th to be canonized by Benedict. His canonization continues a push for saints in Latin America and elsewhere in the developing world that began under John Paul II, who sought role models as part of the church's worldwide reach. John Paul canonized more saints than all of his predecessors combined. "Do you realize how big this is?" asked Herminia Fernandes, who joined the multitude at the airfield for the open-air Mass. "It's huge, this pope is visiting Brazil for the first time and at the same time he is giving us a saint. It's a blessing." Galvao, who died in 1822, began a tradition among Brazilian Catholics of handing out tiny rice-paper pills, inscribed with a Latin prayer, to people seeking cures for everything from cancer to kidney stones. Although doctors and even some Catholic clergy dismiss the pills as placebos or superstitious fakery, cloistered nuns still toil in the Sao Paulo monastery where Galvao is buried, preparing thousands of the pills for free daily distribution. Each one carries these words: "After birth, the Virgin remained intact. Mother of God, intercede on our behalf." After canonizing Galvao, the pope hugged Sandra Grossi de Almeida, 37, and her son Enzo, 7. She is one of two Brazilian women certified by the as divinely inspired miracles justifying the sainthood. She had a uterine malformation that should have made it impossible for her to carry a child for more than four months, but after taking the pills, she gave birth to Enzo. "I have faith," Grossi recently told The Associated Press. "I believe in God, and the proof is right here." Benedict's trip has so far focused on reinforcing church doctrine on abortion, sexual morality and euthanasia. At a rally Thursday night, he instructed young Catholics to avoid premarital sex, remain faithful once they are married and to promote life from "its beginning to natural end." The latter was &#151; at least in part &#151; a reference to abortion, the issue that has dominated Benedict's first papal visit to Latin America. The pope also warned against drug use, violence, corruption and the temptations of wealth and power &#151; themes sure to resonate across the region. Benedict, now 80, a pianist and lover of Mozart, showed his suspicions about popular culture in the 1990s when he acknowledged publicly he was opposed to a performance by Bob Dylan for John Paul II in Bologna, Italy. He said Dylan and other rock performers at the event were committed to a different message than John Paul's and he saw no reason for such so-called "prophets" to intervene. The pope heads Friday evening to the shrine city of Aparecida, about 100 miles from Sao Paulo, where he will visit a drug treatment center Saturday and open a conference of Latin American and Caribbean bishops on Sunday. Aparecida is the most important Catholic religious site in Brazil, home to the mammoth Basilica of Aparecida and the 3-foot statue of a black Virgin Mary called "Our Lady Who Appeared," the patron saint of Brazil. The statue was pulled from a river in the 18th century by poor fishermen who were not catching any fish, and then caught loads in their nets. Miracles were subsequently attributed to the statue, and so many pilgrims flocked to Aparecida that the church built the basilica and inaugurated it as a shrine in 1955. Associated Press writers Tales Azzoni and Alan Clendenning contributed to this report.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070510/ap_on_he_me/thin_fat_people	DIET: Thin people may be fat inside - Yahoo! News DIET: Thin people may be fat inside By MARIA CHENG, AP Medical Writer Thu May 10, 7:28 PM ET LONDON - If it really is what's on the inside that counts, then a lot of thin people might be in trouble. Some doctors now think that the internal fat surrounding vital organs like the heart, liver or pancreas &#151; invisible to the naked eye &#151; could be as dangerous as the more obvious external fat that bulges underneath the skin. "Being thin doesn't automatically mean you're not fat," said Dr. Jimmy Bell, a professor of molecular imaging at Imperial College, London. Since 1994, Bell and his team have scanned nearly 800 people with MRI machines to create "fat maps" showing where people store fat. According to the data, people who maintain their weight through diet rather than exercise are likely to have major deposits of internal fat, even if they are otherwise slim. "The whole concept of being fat needs to be redefined," said Bell, whose research is funded by Britain's Medical Research Council. Without a clear warning signal &#151; like a rounder middle &#151; doctors worry that thin people may be lulled into falsely assuming that because they're not overweight, they're healthy. "Just because someone is lean doesn't make them immune to diabetes or other risk factors for heart disease," said Dr. Louis Teichholz, chief of cardiology at Hackensack Hospital in New Jersey, who was not involved in Bell's research. Even people with normal Body Mass Index scores &#151; a standard obesity measure that divides your weight by the square of your height &#151; can have surprising levels of fat deposits inside. Of the women scanned by Bell and his colleagues, as many as 45 percent of those with normal BMI scores (20 to 25) actually had excessive levels of internal fat. Among men, the percentage was nearly 60 percent. Relating the news to what Bell calls "TOFIs" &#151; people who are "thin outside, fat inside" &#151; is rarely uneventful. "The thinner people are, the bigger the surprise," he said, adding the researchers even found TOFIs among people who are professional models. According to Bell, people who are fat on the inside are essentially on the threshold of being obese. They eat too many fatty, sugary foods &#151; and exercise too little to work it off &#151; but they are not eating enough to actually be fat. Scientists believe we naturally accumulate fat around the belly first, but at some point, the body may start storing it elsewhere. Still, most experts believe that being of normal weight is an indicator of good health, and that BMI is a reliable measurement. "BMI won't give you the exact indication of where fat is, but it's a useful clinical tool," said Dr. Toni Steer, a nutritionist at Britain's Medical Research Council. Doctors are unsure about the exact dangers of internal fat, but some suspect it contributes to the risk of heart disease and diabetes. They theorize that internal fat disrupts the body's communication systems. The fat enveloping internal organs might be sending the body mistaken chemical signals to store fat inside organs like the liver or pancreas. This could ultimately lead to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, or heart disease. Experts have long known that fat, active people can be healthier than their skinny, inactive counterparts. "Normal-weight persons who are sedentary and unfit are at much higher risk for mortality than obese persons who are active and fit," said Dr. Steven Blair, an obesity expert at the University of South Carolina. For example, despite their ripples of fat, super-sized Sumo wrestlers probably have a better metabolic profile than some of their slim, sedentary spectators, Bell said. That's because the wrestlers' fat is primarily stored under the skin, not streaking throughout their vital organs and muscles. The good news is that internal fat can be easily burned off through exercise or even by improving your diet. "Even if you don't see it on your bathroom scale, caloric restriction and physical exercise have an aggressive effect on visceral fat," said Dr. Bob Ross, an obesity expert at Queen's University in Canada. Because many factors contribute to heart disease, Teichholz says it's difficult to determine the precise danger of internal fat &#151; though it certainly doesn't help. "Obesity is a risk factor, but it's lower down on the totem pole of risk factors," he said, explaining that whether or not people smoke, their family histories and blood pressure and cholesterol rates are more important determinants than both external and internal fat. When it comes to being fit, experts say there is no short-cut. "If you just want to look thin, then maybe dieting is enough," Bell said. "But if you want to actually be healthy, then exercise has to be an important component of your lifestyle."

Thu May 10, 9:13 PM ET LOS ANGELES - The survival of a major "Lost" character was left in doubt this week in an episode that shot adrenaline into the plot of the ABC series but failed to give it a needed ratings boost. The Wednesday episode in which Locke ( ) was shot, perhaps fatally, by Ben (Michael Emerson), the leader of "the Others," drew 12.1 million viewers. That's about the same sized audience the show has been attracting in recent weeks. That compares to the 22 million-plus "Lost" drew at its peak last season, its second. Still, the drama about plane-crash survivors on a mysterious island has been winning its 10 p.m. EDT time slot among the young adult viewers prized by advertisers. "Lost" also is building its audience within the hour, demonstrating that viewers who tune in like what they see. In this week's pivotal episode, the audience got a history lesson about Ben's troubled childhood and a clash between two island factions. Given Locke's importance to the show, the odds seem to be in his favor. But the producers have never been queasy about killing off characters who survived the crash but not the show's complex plot twists. ABC's recent announcement that the show will conclude in the 2009-10 season also might have fans wondering if Locke's shooting is a shocking early start to the show's ultimate resolution.

Web site outsources reporting By JUSTIN PRITCHARD, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 5:51 PM ET PASADENA, Calif. - The job posting was a head-scratcher: "We seek a newspaper journalist based in India to report on the city government and political scene of Pasadena, California, USA." A reporter half a world away covering local street-light contracts and sewer repairs? A reporter who has never gotten closer to Pasadena than the telecast of the Rose Bowl parade? Outsourcing first claimed manufacturing jobs, then hit services such as technical support, airline reservations and tax preparation. Now comes the next frontier: local journalism. James Macpherson, editor and publisher of the two-year-old Web site pasadenanow.com, acknowledged it sounds strange to have journalists in India cover news in this wealthy city just outside Los Angeles. But he said it can be done from afar now that weekly Pasadena City Council meetings can be watched over the Internet. And he said the idea makes business sense because of India's lower labor costs. "I think it could be a significant way to increase the quality of journalism on the local level without the expense that is a major problem for local publications," said the 51-year-old Pasadena native. "Whether you're at a desk in Pasadena or a desk in Mumbai, you're still just a phone call or e-mail away from the interview." The first articles, some of which will carry bylines, are slated to appear Friday. The plan has its doubters. "Nobody in their right mind would trust the reporting of people who not only don't know the institutions but aren't even there to witness the events and nuances," said Bryce Nelson, a University of Southern California journalism professor and Pasadena resident. "This is a truly sad picture of what American journalism could become." It is a shaky business proposition as well, said Uday Karmarkar, a UCLA professor of technology and strategy who outsources copy editing and graphics work to Indian businesses. If the goal is sophisticated reporting, he said, Macpherson could end up spending more time editing than the labor savings are worth. This is not the first time media jobs have been shipped to India. The British news agency Reuters runs an operation in the technology capital of Bangalore that churns out Wall Street stories based on news releases. Macpherson appears to be the first to outsource community journalism &#151; work that by definition has been done by reporters who walk the streets they cover. Macphersons said his Web site, which he runs out of his house, gets about 45,000 unique readers per month but is not yet profitable. Up until now, his main help has consisted of his wife and an intern. Macpherson posted the help-wanted ad Monday on the Indian edition of craigslist.org. Within days, he said, he had hired two Indian reporters, one a graduate of the journalism school at the University of California at Berkeley. He wants them to broaden pasadenanow.com's content from news releases and event listings to analyses of issues before the council, and perhaps eventually to investigative reports. Projected annual cost: $20,800 for the pair. Not bad wages for an Indian journalist and cheap by U.S. standards, especially if each one produces the expected 15 weekly articles. Pasadena city spokeswoman Ann Erdman said coverage from afar shouldn't pose problems if the articles are well-edited. In any case, she said, "Local government is certainly not in the practice of dictating to local business who they can hire and where those employees should live."

Modified to have a attribute for better module consistency. to allow specifying categorization scheme. for a human readable label. element for media binary hashing. to distinguish formatting of text. Improved descriptions of various elements and attributes. 08/22/2005 - Improved global syndication capabilities: [1.1.0] attributes to media:text and media:content. to give more flexibility to represent things other than people or companies. to explicitly determine what type of media is expressed. Added a "Best Practices" section to encourage use of the Feed History module, and Dublin Core's expiration capability. Add time code information to 10/22/2005 - Minor improvements: [1.1.1] Added capability for elements to appear at the to allow explicit global relationships to be expressed. The namespace for Media RSS is defined to be: "Media RSS" is a new RSS module that supplements the enclosure capabilities of RSS 2.0. RSS enclosures are already being used to syndicate audio files and images. Media RSS extends enclosures to handle other media types, such as short films or TV, as well as provide additional metadata with the media. Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of . It allows grouping of elements that are effectively the same content, yet different representations. For instance: the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3 format. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media. It contains 14 attributes, most of which are optional. should specify the direct url to the media object. If not included, a element must be specified. is the number of bytes of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the standard MIME type of the object. It is an optional attribute. is the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable). While this attribute can at times seem redundant if is supplied, it is included because it simplifies decision making on the reader side, as well as flushes out any ambiguities between MIME type and object type. It is an optional attribute. determines if this is the default object that should be used for the . There should only be one default object per . It is an optional attribute. determines if the object is a sample or the full version of the object, or even if it is a continuous stream (sample | full | nonstop). Default value is 'full'. It is an optional attribute. is the kilobits per second rate of media. It is an optional attribute. is the number of frames per second for the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of samples per second taken to create the media object. It is expressed in thousands of samples per second (kHz). It is an optional attribute. is number of audio channels in the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of seconds the media object plays. It is an optional attribute. is the height of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the width of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared. If this element is not included, it assumes that no restrictions are necessary. It has one optional attribute. r (cz 1 lz 1 nz 1 oz 1 vz 1) is the URI that identifies the rating scheme. It is an optional attribute. If this attribute is not included, the default scheme is urn:simple (adult | nonadult). The title of the particular media object. It has 1 optional attribute. The Judy's - The Moo Song specifies the type of text embedded. Possible values are either 'plain' or 'html'. Default value is 'plain'. All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. Short description describing the media object typically a sentence in length. It has 1 optional attribute. This was some really bizarre band I listened to as a young lad. specifies the type of text embedded. Possible values are either 'plain' or 'html'. Default value is 'plain'. All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. Highly relevant keywords describing the media object with typically a maximum of ten words. The keywords and phrases should be comma delimited. kitty, cat, big dog, yarn, fluffy Allows particular images to be used as representative images for the media object. If multiple thumbnails are included, and time coding is not at play, it is assumed that the images are in order of importance. It has 1 required attribute and 3 optional attributes. specifies the url of the thumbnail. It is a required attribute. specifies the height of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the width of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the time offset in relation to the media object. Typically this is used when creating multiple keyframes within a single video. The format for this attribute should be in the DSM-CC's Normal Play Time (NTP) as used in RTSP [ RFC 2326 3.6 Normal Play Time ]. It is an optional attribute. NTP has a second or subsecond resolution. It is specified as H:M:S.h (npt-hhmmss) or S.h (npt-sec), where H=hours, M=minutes, S=second and h=fractions of a second. A possible alternative to NTP would be SMPTE. It is believed that NTP is simpler and easier to use. Allows a taxonomy to be set that gives an indication of the type of media content, and its particular contents. It has 2 optional attributes. is the URI that identifies the categorization scheme. It is an optional attribute. If this attribute is not included, the default scheme is 'http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/category_schema'. is the human readable label that can be displayed in end user applications. It is an optional attribute. This is the hash of the binary media file. It can appear multiple times as long as each instance is a different . It has 1 optional attribute. indicates the algorithm used to create the hash. Possible values are 'md5' and 'sha-1'. Default value is 'md5'. It is an optional attribute. Allows the media object to be accessed through a web browser media player console. This element is required only if a direct media attribute is not specified in the element. It has 1 required attribute, and 2 optional attributes. is the url of the player console that plays the media. It is a required attribute. is the height of the browser window that the should be opened in. It is an optional attribute. is the width of the browser window that the should be opened in. It is an optional attribute. Notable entity and the contribution to the creation of the media object. Current entities can include people, companies, locations, etc. Specific entities can have multiple roles, and several entities can have the same role. These should appear as distinct elements. It has 2 optional attributes. role specifies the role the entity played. Must be lowercase. It is an optional attribute. is the URI that identifies the role scheme. It is an optional attribute. If this attribute is not included, the default scheme is 'urn:ebu'. See: European Broadcasting Union Role Codes. actor anchor person author choreographer composer conductor director editor graphic designer grip illustrator lyricist music arranger music group musician orchestra performer photographer producer reporter vocalist European Broadcasting Union Role Codes Copyright information for media object. It has 1 optional attribute. is the url for a terms of use page or additional copyright information. If the media is operating under a Creative Commons license, the Creative Commons module should be used instead. It is an optional attribute. Allows the inclusion of a text transcript, closed captioning, or lyrics of the media content. Many of these elements are permitted to provide a time series of text. In such cases, it is encouraged, but not required, that the elements be grouped by language and appear in time sequence order based on the time. Elements can have overlapping times. It has 4 optional attributes. Oh, say, can you see By the dawn's early light specifies the type of text embedded. Possible values are either 'plain' or 'html'. Default value is 'plain'. All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module.

News Ancient Star Nearly as Old as the Universe Fri May 11, 6:15 AM ET Long before our solar system formed and even before the Milky Way assumed its final spiral shape, a star slightly smaller than the Sun blazed into life in our galaxy, formed from the newly scattered remains of the first stars in the universe. Employing techniques similar to those used to date archeological remains here on Earth, scientists have learned that a metal-poor star in our Milky Way called HE 1523 is 13.2 billion years old -just slightly younger than 13.7 billion year age of the universe. Our solar system is estimated to be only about 4.6 billion years old. The findings are detailed in the May 10 issue of Astrophysical Journal. Like other early stars, HE 1523 contains very few elements heavier than hydrogen or helium. But it does have some. In particular, it contains radioactive metals such as , both of which have extremely long half-lives. A radioactive element&#39;s half life is the time it takes for one half of the original sample to decay. If scientists know an element&#39;s half life and the amount of the original sample, they can estimate an object&#39;s age based on how much of the element is left. Uranium and thorium have half-lives of 4.7 billion years and 14 billion years, respectively. "If you know how much there was in the first place-and I&#39;m getting these numbers from theorists-then you take your measurements and off you go," explained study leader Anna Frebel of the University of Texas. This same technique is used with a radioactive form of carbon, called carbon-14, to date fossils rocks and archeological remains. The uranium and thorium in HE 1523 were probably leftover elements from first generation stars that exploded as supernovas and scattered their atomic ashes through space. Second generation stars like HE 1523 formed from those strewn elements. The researchers obtained a high quality light signature of the star by observing it with the European Southern Observatory&#39;s Very Large Telescope (VLT) for 7.5 hours. From the star&#39;s spectrum, the researchers calculated the amount of uranium and thorium it still contained. Because the uranium and thorium were formed during the supernova explosion of another star, what the researchers really dated was the age of the supernova. But, as Frebel notes, "the time between the supernova and [the birth of HE 1523] is relatively short compared to the age of the star." Scientists are not sure how far away HE 1523 is located, but the star can be seen with the aid of a telescope from the Southern Hemisphere, Frebel said. It is currently a bloated red giant star, and nearing the end of its life, but should still be around for quite a while, she added. While HE 1523 certainly ranks among the oldest stars in the Milky Way, it probably is not the oldest. "This star has a certain metallicity by which we measure its chemical primitiveness, but there are other stars out there that are even more primitive in their nature," Frebel told SPACE.com. in the universe formed between 30 and 150 million years after the Big Bang and were massive behemoths, with masses up to 200 times that of our Sun. Scientists think those stellar first born burned brightly and quickly, lasting only a few hundred million years before exhausting their fuels and winking out as black holes or exploding as supernovas. "Massive stars have a much shorter life time than low mass stars," Frebel said. HE 1523 "is probably a 0.8 solar mass star, and that&#39;s why it can still survive until today." Recent observations of a supernova 240 million-light years away suggests the explosive star deaths of early stars were fundamentally different from the supernovas of later stars, and that they lasted longer, burned brighter and were fueled by an exotic Top 10 Star Mysteries VIDEO: The King of Supernovas Vote Now: The Strangest Things in Space Ancient Star Nearly as Old as the Universe and explore our huge collection of Space Image of the Day .

News Paris Hilton may not serve full sentence Thu May 10, 8:02 PM ET may spend far less than 45 days in county jail for violating probation because of state policies and jail overcrowding, authorities said Thursday. Hilton, sentenced last week to do the time, could spend three weeks or less behind bars because of a state requirement that grants inmates time off for good behavior and because of overcrowding in the system, Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. "It's possible that it could be 21 days, 23 days. It's a complicated formula that the state sets down. It's possible that she could do less time," Whitmore told The Associated Press. As for overcrowding, "our jail is bursting at the seams" and some women inmates have been released after serving only 10 percent of their sentence, Whitmore said. Last year, "Lost" actress was sentenced to 60 days in jail for violating probation after her drunken driving arrest in Hawaii. She was released in hours because of overcrowding. Hilton's time will be determined when she is booked into the county system, Whitmore said. She will not receive any favors because she is a celebrity, he added. "She will be treated like any other inmate who's classified as a low-level security risk," Whitmore told the Los Angeles Times, which first reported the development on its Web site. A call to Hilton's publicist seeking comment was not immediately returned. Hilton, 26, was sentenced last week for violating the terms of her probation in an alcohol-related reckless driving case. A judge ordered her to report to the women's jail in Lynwood by June 5. Hilton intends to appeal and her fans have posted a petition on the Internet urging Gov.

News iPods can make pacemakers malfunction: study Thu May 10, 4:07 PM ET CHICAGO (Reuters) - iPods can cause cardiac implantable pacemakers to malfunction by interfering with the electromagnetic equipment monitoring the heart, according to a study presented by a 17-year-old high school student to a meeting of heart specialists on Thursday. The study tested the effect of the portable music devices on 100 patients, whose mean age was 77, outfitted with pacemakers. Electrical interference was detected half of the time when the iPod was held just 2 inches from the patient&#39;s chest for 5 to 10 seconds. The study did not examine any portable music devices other than iPods, which are made by Apple Inc. In some cases, the iPods caused interference when held 18 inches from the chest. Interfering with the telemetry equipment caused the device to misread the heart&#39;s pacing and in one case caused the pacemaker to stop functioning altogether. The study was held at the Thoracic and Cardiovascular Institute at Michigan State University. The results were presented at the Heart Rhythm Society annual meeting in Denver. Jay Thaker, lead author of the study and a student at Okemos High School in Okemos, Michigan, concluded that iPod interference can lead physicians to misdiagnose actual heart function. Thaker, whose father is an electrophysiologist and whose mother is a rheumatologist, said he asked his dad about a potential interaction between pacemakers and iPods. "We looked online but didn&#39;t see anything. Then, one of his patients asked him if there would be a problem, so (my father) put me in touch with Dr. Krit (Jongnarangsin)," Thaker said in a telephone interview. Jongnarangsin, a long-time friend of Thaker&#39;s father, is the senior author of the study and an assistant professor in the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Michigan. "Most pacemaker patients are not iPod users," Jongnarangsin said. For that reason, he said, it is unclear how often iPods cause misdiagnosis. "This needs to be studied more," Jongnarangsin added. Thaker said he is interested in doing a similar study about how implantable cardioverter defibrillators, known as ICDs, are affected by iPods.

News Terminator Will Be Back, Without Arnold Thu May 10, 8:08 AM ET Los Angeles (E! Online) - The Terminator is making good on its coming-back word. The Governator, not so much. The Halcyon Company has announced plans to revive the cyborg-battling movie series with at least three more films, after the production company purchased all rights to the dormant franchise for an undisclosed, though likely eight-figure, sum. But while Halcyon founders Victor Kubicek and Derek Anderson are looking to begin preproduction on Terminator 4 as soon as possible, they will do so without a leading man. Or man-machine. Plot details for the fourth film have been kept under tight wraps, though are said to pick up with John Connor, heir to the rebellion, in his thirties, leading the remainder of the human race in its ever-worsening battle against the machines. As the film will mark the beginning of a new trilogy, rather than a continuation of the previous three installments, its unlikely that the Terminator himself, , will even take part in the film reinvention, other than perhaps a cameo. Of course, there are other reasons why the Ah-nuld won&#39;t be featured on the big screen. He has a bit of a schedule conflict due to matters of a more gubernatorial nature. T4 has already been fast-tracked for production, with Halcyon looking to get the installment in theaters by summer 2009. As it is, Schwarzenegger will be leading the state of California through 2011. While a spokeswoman for the governor asserts that &#34;no law says he couldn&#39;t&#34; star in the reimagined flick if he wanted to, the project was nonetheless &#34;not even on his radar.&#34; Still, the franchise&#39;s new minders aren&#39;t worried about extending the brand beyond Arnie. &#34;With T3, we included many incidental details and plot points that, along with the ain narrative, set the stage for an entirely new set of inter-related stories covering the future adventures of John Connor and the Terminators,&#34; producer Moritz Borman said. &#34;This new Terminator trilogy will build upon the already huge worldwide Terminator fan base, which was both revitalized and expanded with the global success of T3.&#34; In fact, T3, along with T2 and, well, plain old T, have grossed just over $1 billion worldwide since Terminator was first released in 1984. &#34;The Terminator franchise represents by far the most popular and successful franchise not owned by a major studio,&#34; Kubicek said. &#34;We see this global franchise as a cornerstone of Halcyon&#39;s future business plans.&#34; A very large cornerstone. In addition to the big-screen cyborg saga, the company snapped up all future merchandising and licensing rights to the franchise, future revenue generated by T3: Rise of the Machines and a portion of the rights to an almost guaranteed TV series based on the films. Warner Bros. has already filmed a pilot for The Chronicles, an hourlong show based around the Terminator character and mythology surrounding the movies. According to Variety, Fox has already expressed interest in the project, and could opt to pick up the series at next week&#39;s upfronts, when the fall prime-time schedules are unveiled.

News NASA study: Eastern U.S. to get hotter By SETH BORENSTEIN, AP Science Writer Thu May 10, 5:57 PM ET WASHINGTON - Future eastern United States summers look much hotter than originally predicted with daily highs about 10 degrees warmer than in recent years by the mid-2080s, a new Previous and widely used global warming computer estimates predict too many rainy days, the study says. Because drier weather is hotter, they underestimate how warm it will be east of the Mississippi River, said atmospheric scientists Barry Lynn and Leonard Druyan of Columbia University and NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. "Unless we take some strong action to curtail carbon dioxide emissions, it's going to get a lot hotter," said Lynn, now a scientist at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. "It's going to be a lot more dangerous for people who are not in the best of health." The study got mixed reviews from other climate scientists, in part because the eastern United States has recently been wetter and cooler than forecast. Instead of daily summer highs in the 1990s that averaged in the low to mid 80s Fahrenheit, the eastern United States is in for daily summer highs regularly in the low to mid 90s, the study found. The study only looked at the eastern United States because that was the focus of the funding by the U.S. And that's just the eastern United States as a whole. For individual cities, the future looks even hotter. In the 2080s, the average summer high will probably be 102 degrees in Jacksonville, 100 degrees in Memphis, 96 degrees in Atlanta, and 91 degrees in Chicago and Washington, according to the study published in the peer-reviewed journal Climate. But every now and then a summer will be drier than normal and that means even hotter days, Lynn said. So when Lynn's computer models spit out simulated results for July 2085 the forecasted temperatures sizzled past uncomfortable into painful. The study showed a map where the average high in the southeast neared 115 and pushed 100 in the northeast. Even Canada flirted with the low to mid 90s. Many politicians and climate skeptics have criticized computer models as erring on the side of predicting temperatures that are too hot and outcomes that are too apocalyptic with global warming. But Druyan said the problem is most computer models, especially when compared to their predictions of past observations, underestimate how bad global warming is. That's because they see too many rainy days, which tends to cool temperatures off, he said. There is an established link between rainy and cooler weather and hot and drier weather, said Kevin Trenberth, climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Rainy days means more clouds blocking the sun and more solar heat used to evaporate water, Druyan said. "I'm sorry for the bad news," Druyan said. "It gets worse everywhere." Trenberth said the link between dryness and heat works, but he is a little troubled by the computer modeling done by Lynn and Druyan and points out that recently the eastern United States has been wetter and cooler than expected. A top U.S. climate modeler, Jerry Mahlman, criticized the study as not matching models up correctly and "just sort of whistling in the dark a little bit." But Andrew Weaver of the University of Victoria, editor of the journal Climate but not of this study, praised the paper, saying "it makes perfect sense." He said it shows yet another "positive feedback" in global warming, where one aspect of climate change makes something else worse and it works like a loop. "The more we start to understand of the science, the more positive feedbacks we start to find," Weaver said. Weaver said looking at the map of a hotter eastern United States he can think of one thing: "I like living in Canada."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/socal_fire	S. Calif. island fire turned from town - Yahoo! News S. Calif. island fire turned from town By ANDREW GLAZER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:21 PM ET AVALON, Calif. - Firefighters turned back flames that threatened Santa Catalina Island's main city and some residents planned to return to their homes Friday after thousands were forced to evacuate a day earlier. The wildfire was 4,000 acres, or more than 6 square miles, and was only 10 percent contained early Friday. But worries were eased by the day's favorable weather forecast and the arrival of dozens of fire trucks and air tankers on the narrow, mountainous island 30 miles off Los Angeles. "Everyone is working very hard to make sure that the people are safe and the animals are safe," Gov. Most of the 76-square-mile island is owned by a land conservancy, home to wildlife including the Catalina Island fox, North American bison and bald eagle. Flames that had menaced the main city of Avalon the night before were no longer visible from there on Friday. But a layer of ash and a puff of smoke that rose from a hillside overlooking the crescent harbor were reminders of a harrowing night. "The risk has been reduced significantly," Fire Chief Steven Hoefs said. "Most of the structures have been protected." The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon in the island's rugged interior, feeding on dry brush and fanned by a steady wind into the night. One home and a few small structures in the canyons outside the city burned. About 3,800 residents and tourists fled, Schwarzenegger said. As people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries to the mainland, many covered their faces with towels and bandanas to ward off ashes. Resident Kathy Troeger fled with her three children and a friend's daughter, while her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to fight the blaze. "It was like a nightmare when we left," she said after arriving at the mainland port of Long Beach. "You couldn't breathe, and ash was falling like snow." Anita Bussing, a therapist who has a second home on the island, described a sky "completely gray with orange streaks." The helicopters were flying all over the place," she said. "People were freaking out, children were crying." Island hotel worker Susana Garcia, 22, waited long into the night at the dock looking for her father. She had gone to the mainland to do errands before the fire started and was unable to reach her father, who had stayed behind. "I've been asking everybody if they've seen him, but I haven't found him yet," Garcia said. Dozens of fire engines arrived through the night from as far away as Fresno, carried by giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton. One firefighter was overcome by inhalation and was in stable condition. Wind that reached 20 mph Thursday calmed and were expected to blow the fire westward, away from Avalon and toward the island's sparsely populated center. Despite being well offshore, Catalina has been left parched by the lack of rainfall that has made the rest of Southern California particularly susceptible to wildfires like the one in Los Angeles' Griffith Park this week. Television actor Steven W. Bailey, who lives near the park, had gone to Catalina with his wife to escape the smoke and heat on Thursday. As they approached the island, he spotted the smoke of the island blaze, and when they arrived, they weren't allowed to check into their hotel. "It just descended into more and more fire, more and more smoke, more and more ash," Bailey told KABC-TV. Firefighters were still working Friday to surround what remained of the Griffith Park fire, which briefly chased people from homes and threatened the park's landmark observatory and zoo. Elsewhere around the country, firefighters battled the second Georgia wildfire to burn more than 100,000 acres as gusty wind spread the fast-moving blaze further into northern Florida and toward the tiny town of Fargo west of the Okefenokee Swamp. Officials said the wildfire, ignited Saturday by lightning, had grown so rapidly that after six days it already rivaled a fire that has scorched 116,480 acres, or 182 square miles, of southeastern Georgia forest and swampland since April 16 &#151; the state's largest wildfire on record. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. A haze was seen in Miami, more than 300 miles away. To the north, a wildfire grew to nearly 86 square miles in northeastern Minnesota and across the border into Canada, cutting power and phone lines to many resorts and lake homes. The fire, driven by high wind Thursday and fed by drought-parched forest, has already destroyed 45 structures and was threatening about 200 more. The chance of desperately needed rainfall was still days away.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_bi_ge/oxycontin_plea	OxyContin maker, execs guilty of deceit - Yahoo! News OxyContin maker, execs guilty of deceit By SUE LINDSEY, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 5:05 AM ET ROANOKE, Va. - The maker of the powerful painkiller OxyContin and three of its current and former executives pleaded guilty Thursday to misleading the public about the drug's risk of addiction, a federal prosecutor and the company said. Purdue Pharma L.P., its president, top lawyer and former chief medical officer will pay $634.5 million in fines for claiming the drug was less addictive and less subject to abuse than other pain medications, U.S. Attorney John Brownlee said. The plea agreement settled a national case and came two days after the Stamford, Conn.-based company agreed to pay $19.5 million to 26 states and the District of Columbia to settle complaints that it encouraged physicians to overprescribe OxyContin. "With its OxyContin, Purdue unleashed a highly abusable, addictive, and potentially dangerous drug on an unsuspecting and unknowing public," Brownlee said. "For these misrepresentations and crimes, Purdue and its executives have been brought to justice." Purdue spokesman James Heins objected to any suggestion of ties between the plea agreement and the abuse of OxyContin. "We promoted the medicine only to health-care professionals, not to consumers," he said in a statement. Privately held Purdue learned from focus groups with physicians in 1995 that doctors were worried about the abuse potential of OxyContin. The company then gave false information to its sales representatives that the drug had less potential for addiction and abuse than other painkillers, the U.S. attorney said. Ken Jost of the Justice Department's Office of Consumer Litigation said this case should put pharmaceutical companies on notice that they won't be able to get away with breaking the law to make a profit. "The things that they plot in their boardrooms, the things that they do behind closed doors will not stay behind closed doors," Jost said. "We have the people, we have the resources. We'll take the time and we'll take the effort to find out what they did and how they did it." Purdue Pharma said it accepted responsibility for its employees' actions. "During the past six years, we have implemented changes to our internal training, compliance and monitoring systems that seek to assure that similar events do not occur again," the company said in a news release. OxyContin, a trade name for oxycodone, is a time-release painkiller that can be highly addictive. Designed to be swallowed whole and digested over 12 hours, the pills can produce a heroin-like high if crushed and then swallowed, snorted or injected. From 1996 to 2001, the number of oxycodone-related deaths nationwide increased fivefold while the annual number of OxyContin prescriptions increased nearly 20-fold, according to a report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2002, the DEA said the drug caused 146 deaths and contributed to another 318. The U.S. attorney said the guilty pleas were entered Thursday morning in U.S. District Court in Abingdon, about 135 miles southwest of Roanoke. In an unusual move, Brownlee said, company chief executive officer Michael Friedman, general counsel Howard Udell and former chief medical officer Paul Goldenheim each pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of misbranding the drug. Of the total fine, $34.5 million was levied on those three. The fines will be distributed to state and federal law enforcement agencies, the federal government, federal and state Medicaid programs, a Virginia prescription monitoring program and individuals who had sued the company. About $5 million will go toward a six-year company program to monitor compliance with the agreement. When he took office in 2001, Brownlee said, his office was handling a number of cases related to OxyContin abuse, including crimes by addicts seeking to support their habits and arrests of street dealers and even pharmacists and physicians. "But it always seemed, I think to me and to the investigators, that there was more," he told a news conference. Investigators from a number of state and federal agencies worked together on an investigation of Purdue Pharma and began to subpoena company records in 2002, Brownlee said. "From these millions of records, they picked out probably 300 to 500 documents and pieced together a case," he said. Food and Drug Administration Food and Drug Administration was part of the investigation. A spokesman for Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the agency had not acted on a citizen petition Blumenthal's office filed more than three years ago. The petition raised concerns about misbranding and called for stronger warnings and fuller disclosure about OxyContin's dangers. Kim Rice of the FDA told the news conference that over time the agency has mandated increasingly stronger warnings on labels about OxyContin's abuse potential. Purdue Pharma recruited high-profile help in 2002 as the nation's number of oxycodone-related deaths rose dramatically. It hired former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's firm, Giuliani Partners, to try to prevent smuggling and abuse of the drug. "Purdue has demonstrated its commitment to fighting this problem in launching practical and novel solutions including the provision of tamper-resistant prescription pads to over 10,000 physicians and implementing its highly acclaimed `Painfully Obvious' teen education program," Giuliani said at the time.

News Armless, one-legged driver leads chase Thu May 10, 6:19 PM ET NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. - Authorities were led on a high speed vehicle chase by an armless, one-legged man, and they said this wasn't the first time the 40-year-old eluded police. Michael Francis Wiley taught himself to drive after losing both arms and a leg in an electrical accident when he was 13. He spent time in prison for kicking a Florida Highway Patrol trooper after an accident in 1996. He led police on a 120 mph chase in 1998. On Tuesday, Wiley sped off in a Ford Explorer when police approached him at a convenience store, New Port Richey police Capt. Darryl Garman said. Officers pursued, but called off the chase after eight minutes because they did not want to put others in danger, Garman said. Wiley was arrested the next day on charges of fleeing from police and habitually driving without a license. He also is awaiting trial on separate drug charges and traffic violations. He faces up to five years in prison if convicted. Defense attorney John Hooker said his client has paid off previous traffic fines that got his license suspended and tried to get a new driver's license, but he was rebuffed by state officials. Wiley's license has been revoked so many times it is now a felony to drive. "What makes him do it?" Hooker said when asked why Wiley keeps getting behind the wheel. "I think it's an urge he has that makes him feel as important and as good as anyone. It gives him a sense of self-esteem." Hooker said he had not had a chance to talk to Wiley about the most recent charges. Even before Wednesday's arrest, prosecutors were seeking to send Wiley to prison for at least five years for felony drug and traffic charges. "He has a hideous record," Assistant State Attorney Mike Halkitis said after an August 2006 arrest. "It's just got to end." Wiley was being held in the Pasco County jail on $500,000 bond.

News Panty-clad man tries robbery with lighter Thu May 10, 10:58 PM ET INWOOD, W.Va. - A thief covered his face with a pair of blue women's underwear and used a pistol-shaped cigarette lighter in a botched robbery of a convenience store, police said. "I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried," State Police Sgt. T.C. Kearns told The Journal in Martinsburg. The cashier at first thought it was a joke and refused to give the man any money, so he ran to a Jeep Cherokee and drove away at about 4 a.m. Wednesday, Kearns said. A few minutes later, police stopped a vehicle matching that description and took two men into custody. Police later charged Steven Clay Stephenson, 34, of Ranson in the convenience story robbery. Kearns said police found a pistol-shaped lighter while searching Stephenson. The underwear was recovered nearby. Stephenson is charged with nighttime burglary, attempted robbery, first-offense driving under the influence, petit larceny and improper registration. He was being held Thursday at the Eastern Regional Jail. The Berkeley County Prosecuting Attorney's Office had no record of a defense attorney being assigned yet to represent Stephenson.

News German man found after 7 years dead in bed Fri May 11, 8:30 AM ET BERLIN (Reuters) - The decomposed corpse of a German man was found alone in his bed after nearly seven years, police in the western city of Essen said Thursday. The police said in a statement the man was 59 and unemployed at the time of his death. He most likely died of natural causes on November 30, 2000, the date he received a letter from the Welfare Office found in the apartment, police said. Next to the dead man&#39;s bed police found cigarettes, an open television guide and Deutschemark coins, which came out of circulation after the euro was introduced in 2002. The man&#39;s apartment was in a building with offices and apartments, many of which are now empty. "No one missed him. No missing person report was ever filed," the police said.

News Scientist: Don&#39;t Trust Sunscreen Fri May 11, 9:50 AM ET The latest skin-cancer prevention advice is to stop trusting sunscreen as the front line of defense against harmful rays. Instead, wear sunblocking clothing or stay out of the sun altogether, experts say. Sunscreen has been shown to protect against UV skin damage as well as basal carcinomas and squamous cell carcinoma&mdash;two of the three most common skin cancers . However, it has not been conclusively shown to protect against , the most fatal kind, said Stephan Lautenschlager of the Outpatient Clinic of Dermatology at Triemli Hospital in Switzerland. Lautenschlager and his colleagues carried out a comprehensive review on worldwide, recently detailed online in the journal Lancet. "Wearing sun-protective clothing and a hat and reducing sun exposure to a minimum should be preferred to sunscreens," Lautenschlager said. People tend to sunbathe for social reasons, he said. "Nevertheless, sunscreens should not be abused in an attempt to increase time in the sun to a maximum." The best clothing for sun protection is tightly woven, thick garments made of denim, wool or polyester, not cotton, linen or acetate, he said. Dry material or clothes that have shrunk after washing are denser and better at blocking UV rays than wet, stretched or bleached clothing. Outdoors, wear sunscreen and lots of it. Zinc or titanium oxide sunscreens scatter UV light and yield fewer allergies, so they are better for children, he said. The more common sunscreen lotions, called organic sunscreens, absorb UV rays. "The application of a liberal quantity of sunscreen is by far the most important factor for effectiveness of the sunscreen, followed by the uniformity of application and the specific absorption spectrum of the agent used," Lautenschlager said. That is, don&#39;t treat the stuff like liquid gold. Smear it on. A shot glass-full should be applied 15 to 30 minutes before heading outdoors. Look at your skin While four out of five people are concerned about skin , more than half have never been screened for skin cancer (54 percent) and nearly one quarter (23 percent) never examine their skin for changes to moles and blemishes, according to a recent survey by the American Academy of Dermatology. More than 1 million new cases of skin cancer will be diagnosed this year, the AAD says, but when detected early, even To check yourself, regular inspect all your skin, including the back, scalp, buttocks, soles of the feet, between the toes and the palms of the hands. Use mirrors when necessary. Other tips from the AAD: Seek shade if you must be outdoors during the sun&#39;s strongest hours, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Avoid . Their UV light causes skin cancer and wrinkling. Use a self-tanning lotion if you want to look tanned.

News U.S. divorce rate lowest since 1970 By DAVID CRARY, AP National Writer Thu May 10, 2:43 PM ET NEW YORK - By the numbers, divorce just isn't what it used to be. Despite the common notion that America remains plagued by a divorce epidemic, the national per capita divorce rate has declined steadily since its peak in 1981 and is now at its lowest level since 1970. Yet Americans aren't necessarily making better choices about their long-term relationships. Even those who study marriage and work to make it more successful can't decide whether the trend is grounds for celebration or cynicism. Some experts say relationships are as unstable as ever &#151; and divorces are down primarily because more couples live together without marrying. Other researchers have documented what they call "the divorce divide," contending that divorce rates are indeed falling substantively among college-educated couples but not among less-affluent, less-educated couples. "Families with two earners with good jobs have seen an improvement in their standard of living, which leads to less tension at home and lower probability of divorce," said Andrew Cherlin, a professor of public policy at Johns Hopkins University. America's divorce rate began climbing in the late 1960s and skyrocketed during the '70s and early '80s, as virtually every state adopted no-fault divorce laws. The rate peaked at 5.3 divorces per 1,000 people in 1981. But since then it's dropped by one-third, to 3.6. That's the lowest rate since 1970. What's fueling that decline? According to 20 scholars, marriage-promotion experts and divorce lawyers consulted by The Associated Press, a combination of things. The number of couples who live together without marrying has increased tenfold since 1960; the marriage rate has dropped by nearly 30 percent in past 25 years; and Americans are waiting about five years longer to marry than they did in 1970. Adding such factors together, Patrick Fagan of the conservative Heritage Foundation sees a bad situation. "Cohabitation is very fragile, and when unmarried parents split, for the child it might as well be a divorce," Fagan said. "Among those who are marrying there's increased stability, but overall the children of the nation are getting a rawer and rawer deal from their parents." Other experts, however, are heartened by what they view as the increased determination of many couples to make marriage work. Among them is Bill Chausee of Child and Family Services of New Hampshire, which offers marriage-strengthening programs in a state where divorces dropped more than 25 percent between 2000 and 2005. "People don't see marriage problems as some sort of stigma any more," said Chausee. "They're really interested in learning how to stay married; a lot of them are realizing they need more skill." Some states have made concerted efforts to combat divorce with publicly funded marriage education campaigns, although their effectiveness remains in question. In Oklahoma, 100,000 people have attended workshops since a marriage initiative began in 2001, but the latest divorce figures showed no drop, and the campaign's backers no long stress their original goal of cutting divorce by one-third by 2010. Wayne and Carol Sutton are among the couples who've gone to Oklahoma's marriage workshops; they attended a half-dozen sessions earlier this year in their hometown of Tulsa. "This was a way to gain some insight," said Wayne Sutton, a longtime petroleum engineer whose wife also works in the energy industry. "They tell you to regenerate the closeness you had when you got married." Sutton, 51, and his wife, 46, married in 1995 and have a 9-year-old son. "We're like any marriage," he said. "We've had rocky periods and Cloud Nine periods. ... We decided a long time ago were not going to desert each other; we were going to stay together no matter what." The Bush administration believes such programs have merit &#151; its Healthy Marriage initiative has disbursed more than $200 million nationwide in the past five years. Bill Coffin, the Department of Health and Human Services Department of Health and Human Services ' special assistant for marriage education, is convinced the programs are a factor in the declining divorce rate. "The word is getting out that marriage doesn't have to be a crap shoot &#151; it's not the luck of the draw," Coffin said. "It's how you deal with the inevitable conflict and anger in marriage." He subscribes to the theory that better-educated, wealthier couples have better odds of success in marriage. "What we're doing is making sure the poor have access to some help and support," Coffin said. "So many people never heard of marriage education before." One of the researchers whose studies detected the "divorce divide" is University of Maryland sociologist Steve Martin. Comparing marriages from early 1970s to those of the early '90s, Martin found that the rate of breakups within 10 years of marriage dropped by one-third among college-educated women while remaining stable among less-educated women. "Overall, marriages will become more stable only if the lower two-thirds of the population starts behaving like the top third," Martin said. "There's a lot of debate &#151; is that possible? Can marriage training or other programs give all couples the sort of relationship skills that people imagine college graduates have?" Stephanie Coontz, who teaches history and family studies at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., says divorces are dropping in the college-educated sector because many spouses "are learning how to negotiate marriages based on less rigid gender roles than in the past." "College-educated wives are more likely to work than less-educated wives, and a recent study found that unlike the past, a wife's work now tends to stabilize marriage," she said. Glenn Stanton, a family policy expert with the conservative ministry Focus on the Family, suggested one factor behind the declining divorce rate was simply a societal revulsion toward the high rates of recent decades. "In the past 30 years, we've had more divorce than any culture has ever had," he said. "A lot of young adults now are coming out of the family upheaval of the '70s, and they are cohabiting out of fear. They don't want to mess up the nice clean carpet of marriage &#151; they saw their parents do that." Amber Settle and her partner, Andre Berthiaume, are among the couples who have opted not to marry, even as they celebrate 10 years of living together and raise a 3-year-old daughter in Chicago. Each teaches computer science at DePaul University, each is 39, each has parents who divorced. "We decided a long time ago that marriage wasn't for us," Settle said. "We have a number of friends who got married, and we've supported them. But it's not something we want to do." Among their reasons, she said, was their belief it would be unfair to get married until same-sex couples across the country had the same opportunity. Observing her married friends, Settle sees some wonderful relationships and some on the rocks. Married or cohabiting, she said, "you have to work hard at a relationship to make it work." The per capita divorce rate is different from another method of calculation &#151; the percentage of marriages that will eventually end in divorce or separation. Many experts discount the popular notion that one of two U.S. marriages end in divorce, and suggest the breakup rate, which is hard to calculate, has stabilized in recent years at between 40 percent and 45 percent. Gaetano Ferro of New Canaan, Conn., president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, says overall national trends haven't had a noticeable effect on his fellow divorce lawyers. "I've been active in the academy two decades plus," Ferro said. "I've never heard anyone say, 'We're in trouble. There are fewer divorces.'" But North Carolina divorce lawyer Lee Rosen, while reporting that business for his large firm is booming, says he has noticed a trend toward increased realism and civility among couples with marital strains. Many seek mediation as they split, and arrange for joint legal custody of their children. "People are coexisting more peacefully, whether they stay together or come apart," Rosen said. "They are more contemplative and serious about their relationships, and I see people stay together who once would have allowed the marriage to unravel." Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Ricky Williams fails marijuana test By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer 1 hour, 18 minutes ago MIAMI - Former NFL rushing champion Ricky Williams tested positive again for marijuana last month, which will delay his return to the league until at least September, a person familiar with the case said Friday. Williams sought to end a one-year drug suspension last month when he asked to rejoin the Following the positive drug test, clinicians in the NFL's substance abuse program advised commissioner Roger Goodell to delay reinstatement, the person close to the case said. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the testing program. The Dolphins and the NFL declined comment. Williams, who turns 30 on May 21, has played only 12 games since 2003. Before his latest setback, new Miami coach Cam Cameron repeatedly declined to say whether he would welcome Williams back. Williams' latest positive test first was reported by ESPN.com. His agent, Leigh Steinberg, did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment. The NFL suspended Williams in April 2006 after he violated the league's drug policy for the fourth time. That failed test apparently involved a substance other than marijuana and may have been related to his interest in holistic medicine. Williams' previous positive drug tests were for marijuana, which he acknowledged using. Last year Williams played in the Canadian Football League, then taught yoga in California. Steinberg recently quoted Williams as saying his interest in Eastern philosophy had overcome his desire for mind-altering substances. Williams still owes the Dolphins $8.6 million for breaching his contract when he sat out the 2004 season, but they've given no signal they want him back. General manager Randy Mueller traded Williams when both were with the in 2002. Two-year starter Ronnie Brown is expected to return as Miami's starter at running back, and the team acquired running back Lorenzo Booker of Florida State in the third round of the draft last month. coach Scott Linehan, the offensive coordinator for the Dolphins when Williams last played in 2005, recently said he would consider acquiring Williams as a backup. Williams won the 1998 Heisman Trophy at Texas and the 2002 NFL rushing title with the Dolphins. Last season with the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL, he rushed for 526 yards in 109 carries but missed two months with a broken arm.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/pope_brazil	Pope canonizes first Brazilian saint - Yahoo! News Pope canonizes first Brazilian saint By VICTOR L. SIMPSON, Associated Press Writer SAO PAULO, Brazil - castigated popular culture for promoting sexual immorality Friday as he canonized Brazil's first native-born saint before hundreds of thousands of faithful and a sea of flags in the world's largest Roman Catholic nation. Holding up Friar Antonio de Sant'Anna Galvao as a model of rectitude and humility "in an age so full of hedonism," Benedict said the world needs clear souls and pure minds, adding: "It is necessary to oppose those elements of the media that ridicule the sanctity of marriage and virginity before marriage." Benedict didn't elaborate, but his message for Brazilian Catholics reflected his uneasiness with the impact of popular culture on young people. Earlier this year, Benedict declared that "any trend to produce programs and products &#151; including animated films and video games &#151; which in the name of entertainment exalt violence and portray anti-social behavior or the trivialization of human sexuality is a perversion." Later, meeting with the country's 430 bishop's in Sao Paulo's cathedral, Benedict lamented that Brazil is in the midst of "difficult times for the church" amid "aggressive proselytizing" by born-again Protestant congregations. The census says the percentage of Brazilians characterizing themselves as Catholics dropped from 89 percent in 1980 to 74 percent in 2000, while those calling themselves evangelical Protestants rose from 7 percent to 15 percent. Benedict's message on immorality could be a tough sell in hedonistic Brazil. Sex before marriage is common. Scantily clad actresses are the norm on hugely popular TV soap operas, and most women on Brazil's famed beaches wear bikinis that leave so little to the imagination. "Nothing could be more countercultural than his message in Brazil, the land of the thong," said David Gibson, author of "The Rule of Benedict: Pope Benedict XVI and His Battle with the Modern World." Brazilian news media said the crowd reached about 1 million &#151; as church officials had hoped for &#151; although there were large empty spaces on the airfield in South America's largest city. Benedict pronounced the sainthood of Galvao, a Franciscan monk credited by the church with 5,000 miracle cures, while he sat on a throne of Brazilian hardwood, surrounded by Latin American bishops and choirs of hundreds. Galvao is the first native-born saint from Brazil, home to more than 120 million of the planet's 1.1 billion Catholics, and the 10th to be canonized by Benedict. His canonization continues a push for saints in Latin America and elsewhere in the developing world that began under John Paul II, who sought role models as part of the church's worldwide reach. John Paul canonized more saints than all of his predecessors combined. "Do you realize how big this is?" asked Herminia Fernandes, who joined the multitude at the airfield for the open-air Mass. "It's huge, this pope is visiting Brazil for the first time and at the same time he is giving us a saint. It's a blessing." Galvao, who died in 1822, began a tradition among Brazilian Catholics of handing out tiny rice-paper pills, inscribed with a Latin prayer, to people seeking cures for everything from cancer to kidney stones. Although doctors and even some Catholic clergy dismiss the pills as placebos or superstitious fakery, cloistered nuns still toil in the Sao Paulo monastery where Galvao is buried, preparing thousands of the pills for free daily distribution. Each one carries these words: "After birth, the Virgin remained intact. Mother of God, intercede on our behalf." After canonizing Galvao, the pope hugged Sandra Grossi de Almeida, 37, and her son Enzo, 7. She is one of two Brazilian women certified by the as divinely inspired miracles justifying the sainthood. She had a uterine malformation that should have made it impossible for her to carry a child for more than four months, but after taking the pills, she gave birth to Enzo. "I have faith," Grossi recently told The Associated Press. "I believe in God, and the proof is right here." Benedict's trip has so far focused on reinforcing church doctrine on abortion, sexual morality and euthanasia. At a rally Thursday night, he instructed young Catholics to avoid premarital sex, remain faithful once they are married and to promote life from "its beginning to natural end." The latter was &#151; at least in part &#151; a reference to abortion, the issue that has dominated Benedict's first papal visit to Latin America. The pope also warned against drug use, violence, corruption and the temptations of wealth and power &#151; themes sure to resonate across the region. Benedict, now 80, a pianist and lover of Mozart, showed his suspicions about popular culture in the 1990s when he acknowledged publicly he was opposed to a performance by Bob Dylan for John Paul II in Bologna, Italy. He said Dylan and other rock performers at the event were committed to a different message than John Paul's and he saw no reason for such so-called "prophets" to intervene. The pope heads Friday evening to the shrine city of Aparecida, about 100 miles from Sao Paulo, where he will visit a drug treatment center Saturday and open a conference of Latin American and Caribbean bishops on Sunday. Aparecida is the most important Catholic religious site in Brazil, home to the mammoth Basilica of Aparecida and the 3-foot statue of a black Virgin Mary called "Our Lady Who Appeared," the patron saint of Brazil. The statue was pulled from a river in the 18th century by poor fishermen who were not catching any fish, and then caught loads in their nets. Miracles were subsequently attributed to the statue, and so many pilgrims flocked to Aparecida that the church built the basilica and inaugurated it as a shrine in 1955. Associated Press writers Tales Azzoni and Alan Clendenning contributed to this report.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070510/ap_on_he_me/thin_fat_people	DIET: Thin people may be fat inside - Yahoo! News DIET: Thin people may be fat inside By MARIA CHENG, AP Medical Writer Thu May 10, 7:28 PM ET LONDON - If it really is what's on the inside that counts, then a lot of thin people might be in trouble. Some doctors now think that the internal fat surrounding vital organs like the heart, liver or pancreas &#151; invisible to the naked eye &#151; could be as dangerous as the more obvious external fat that bulges underneath the skin. "Being thin doesn't automatically mean you're not fat," said Dr. Jimmy Bell, a professor of molecular imaging at Imperial College, London. Since 1994, Bell and his team have scanned nearly 800 people with MRI machines to create "fat maps" showing where people store fat. According to the data, people who maintain their weight through diet rather than exercise are likely to have major deposits of internal fat, even if they are otherwise slim. "The whole concept of being fat needs to be redefined," said Bell, whose research is funded by Britain's Medical Research Council. Without a clear warning signal &#151; like a rounder middle &#151; doctors worry that thin people may be lulled into falsely assuming that because they're not overweight, they're healthy. "Just because someone is lean doesn't make them immune to diabetes or other risk factors for heart disease," said Dr. Louis Teichholz, chief of cardiology at Hackensack Hospital in New Jersey, who was not involved in Bell's research. Even people with normal Body Mass Index scores &#151; a standard obesity measure that divides your weight by the square of your height &#151; can have surprising levels of fat deposits inside. Of the women scanned by Bell and his colleagues, as many as 45 percent of those with normal BMI scores (20 to 25) actually had excessive levels of internal fat. Among men, the percentage was nearly 60 percent. Relating the news to what Bell calls "TOFIs" &#151; people who are "thin outside, fat inside" &#151; is rarely uneventful. "The thinner people are, the bigger the surprise," he said, adding the researchers even found TOFIs among people who are professional models. According to Bell, people who are fat on the inside are essentially on the threshold of being obese. They eat too many fatty, sugary foods &#151; and exercise too little to work it off &#151; but they are not eating enough to actually be fat. Scientists believe we naturally accumulate fat around the belly first, but at some point, the body may start storing it elsewhere. Still, most experts believe that being of normal weight is an indicator of good health, and that BMI is a reliable measurement. "BMI won't give you the exact indication of where fat is, but it's a useful clinical tool," said Dr. Toni Steer, a nutritionist at Britain's Medical Research Council. Doctors are unsure about the exact dangers of internal fat, but some suspect it contributes to the risk of heart disease and diabetes. They theorize that internal fat disrupts the body's communication systems. The fat enveloping internal organs might be sending the body mistaken chemical signals to store fat inside organs like the liver or pancreas. This could ultimately lead to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, or heart disease. Experts have long known that fat, active people can be healthier than their skinny, inactive counterparts. "Normal-weight persons who are sedentary and unfit are at much higher risk for mortality than obese persons who are active and fit," said Dr. Steven Blair, an obesity expert at the University of South Carolina. For example, despite their ripples of fat, super-sized Sumo wrestlers probably have a better metabolic profile than some of their slim, sedentary spectators, Bell said. That's because the wrestlers' fat is primarily stored under the skin, not streaking throughout their vital organs and muscles. The good news is that internal fat can be easily burned off through exercise or even by improving your diet. "Even if you don't see it on your bathroom scale, caloric restriction and physical exercise have an aggressive effect on visceral fat," said Dr. Bob Ross, an obesity expert at Queen's University in Canada. Because many factors contribute to heart disease, Teichholz says it's difficult to determine the precise danger of internal fat &#151; though it certainly doesn't help. "Obesity is a risk factor, but it's lower down on the totem pole of risk factors," he said, explaining that whether or not people smoke, their family histories and blood pressure and cholesterol rates are more important determinants than both external and internal fat. When it comes to being fit, experts say there is no short-cut. "If you just want to look thin, then maybe dieting is enough," Bell said. "But if you want to actually be healthy, then exercise has to be an important component of your lifestyle."

News Misery lures opportunists at foreclosure auction Fri May 11, 3:56 PM ET By Peter Henderson, Tim McLaughlin, Andy Sullivan and Al Yoon RIVERSIDE, California (Reuters) - Twice a day, would-be real estate moguls gather on the local courthouse steps for the latest can&#39;t-miss opportunity in California&#39;s land rush: the foreclosure auction. Beneath the shade of a magnolia tree, veterans and "newbies" crowd around auctioneer Gary Oberdalhoff as he lists a property whose owners couldn&#39;t pay the mortgage, one of thousands to go on the block in this sprawling, arid region 50 miles east of Los Angeles. "Do I have any opening bids?" Oberdalhoff asks. Several step forward to show him cashier&#39;s checks worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the bidding begins. It might be a scene straight out of the Great Depression, if you ignore the Bluetooth wireless headsets. A record level of home foreclosures has hit the U.S. housing sector after years of reckless lending to risky borrowers. To those on the courthouse steps, that spells opportunity. Unlike during the Great Depression, investors are still eager to enter the market. "A lot of people&#39;s misery is other people&#39;s gains," says investor Bryon Bettencourt. "It&#39;s just the way of the world, dog eat dog." As the nation&#39;s real-estate boom curdles, speculators who a year ago might have camped out in front of new housing developments are now hoping to find a bargain among the thousands of houses emptied by foreclosure. But veterans say true bargains are becoming harder to find as the number of homes on the auction block swells. Few places have felt the impact of the slowing market more than this fast-growing region known as the Inland Empire of Southern California. Starting in the 1970s, the Inland Empire&#39;s orange groves gave way to subdivisions as families migrated from the coast in search of relatively affordable housing. As property values marched higher over the past decade, homeowners refinanced their mortgages to pay for vacations and new cars. Thanks to risk-tolerant "subprime" lenders, people with a history of bankruptcy and maxed-out credit cards were able to enter the housing market with loans charging higher rates for borrowers with lower credit quality. But many of these new homeowners couldn&#39;t afford their mortgages, or fell behind when their adjustable monthly payments shot up. Two years ago, they might have been able to sell the house for a healthy profit. But that&#39;s not an option now that prices have stopped rising. After three months of missed payments, homeowners receive a default notice. Three months after that, the bank can repossess the house and auction it off to pay off the loan. Foreclosure and default filings in the region quadrupled from February 2006 to February 2007, according to research firm First American LoanPerformance. Nationwide, they increased 12 percent to record levels during that period. During the first three months of the year, 1 in 68 houses in the Inland Empire was in default or foreclosure, a rate surpassed only by Detroit and Las Vegas, according to research firm RealtyTrac. "This is ground zero; this is where it&#39;s all happening," says Juan Cruz, whose urban-cool ski hat and baggy jeans contrast with the golf shirts and running shoes favored by the other speculators. Cruz has his eye on a four-bedroom house in nearby Corona offered at &#36;131,000. That figure represents the unpaid balance on the previous homeowner&#39;s foreclosed mortgage. At that price, Cruz thinks he can turn the house around for a nice profit even if it requires some work. Like the other bidders, Cruz has never seen the inside. When the bidding starts, Cruz has plenty of competition. The speculators bid steadily in hundred-dollar increments with cell phones pressed to their ears, keeping their bosses up to date on the action. Twenty minutes later the house is sold to a heavyset man for &#36;286,000. That&#39;s less than it would have fetched last year. But veteran home buyers have grown more cautious as the market has cooled. More houses are on the market now than at any time in the past eight years, according to the Multi-Region Multiple Listing Service database. At the current pace it would take more than 13 months to sell them all, compared with 7 months at this time last year. Bargains are scarce on the auction block these days. Houses purchased in the last two years are often saddled with steep mortgages that can exceed the house&#39;s market value. Sales are down from last year and prices have risen less than 1 percent, according to DataQuick Information Systems. "Now your house has to be underpriced and spectacular to sell," says foreclosure investor David Schultheiss. Today&#39;s auction is an exception, as all three houses offered find eager buyers. At an auction in Corona the previous afternoon, only one house out of 13 sold -- for a penny more than its asking price. That&#39;s typical, say those involved. The banks set as the starting price the amount left on the mortgage. If the mortgage is higher than the home value, which it often is, investors will not bid. Banks are then forced to sell later, likely at a loss. Ironically, new investors are piling into the market as bargains become harder to find. Good times may come and go, but get-rich-quick dreams spring eternal. Promoters tout the fortunes to be made in the foreclosure market at seminars and workshops across Southern California. "There&#39;s literally never been a better time to get into investing in foreclosures!" promises a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Times. "Could you use an extra &#36;10,000 this month?" Because state law requires foreclosed homes to be auctioned to the public, new investors are theoretically on an equal footing with banks and other institutional investors. But they&#39;re going up against veterans who have been in the game since the last bust, in the early 1990s. A pair of inexperienced, eager investors draw smirks when they bid up a house to &#36;361,000. "She&#39;s toast, dude. You won&#39;t see her in three months," says veteran investor William Honens, who says the buyers will be lucky to break even. The auction winners, Coc Vu and Alan Ford, say they&#39;re thrilled with their purchase. They plan to put it back on the market immediately. "Now we want to drive by and see our house," Vu says. Before she got into foreclosure investing, Vu went door to door asking homeowners if they wanted to to sell. That could draw an angry response. On the courthouse steps, she doesn&#39;t have to worry about anyone slamming the door in her face. The former owners have usually moved out, and they don&#39;t show up at the auction. Their dreams and struggles are reduced to a sheaf of filings at the county clerk&#39;s office two blocks away. Take 870 Zeppelin Court, a house in the rapidly developing farm town of San Jacinto that fetched &#36;250,000 at auction. The former owner bought the house with a pair of subprime mortgages in March 2004. Both featured adjustable rates that could increase after two years. She took out a third loan in July 2005. Her first default notice arrived in January. Manure perfumes the air in San Jacinto, 30 miles east of Riverside. The mountains are closer here, less obscured by smog. The house at 870 Zeppelin Court turns out to be a pink stucco bungalow with a sickly palm tree out front. Pigeon droppings litter the stoop. An auction notice is taped to the front door, along with doorknockers&#39; business cards -- "I can pay all cash with no contingencies and close in a few days if needed," reads one. Neighbor Carlos Hernandez, an airplane mechanic, says the house has sat vacant for eight months. He&#39;s eager to hear if anybody is moving into a neighborhood where sellers have outnumbered buyers. "She tried to sell it," he says of his neighbor. "No bites."

From its peak in the 1980s &#151; when it regularly ranked among the 100 most popular names that parents chose for their daughters &#151; it had gradually slumped to 247th by 2005, even before Hurricane Katrina smashed the Gulf Coast in late summer of that year. The name's association with the catastrophe has now knocked it out of consideration for most parents, sinking its popularity to the lowest ebb since the 1950s. Only about 850 baby girls in the United States were named Katrina last year, according to new data released Friday by the , dropping it more than 100 slots on the popularity list. At a rank of 382nd, it now sits just below Brenna. Ironically, the two states that suffered most of Katrina's wrath bucked the trend, if only in small numbers. In Louisiana, the number of babies named Katrina jumped from eight in the 12 months before the storm to 15 in the 12 months after, according to state health officials. In Mississippi, seven babies were given the name from 2004 until the storm hit in August 2005, according to state data. The number climbed to 24 from September 2005 through the end of 2006. Overall, the country's most popular names list hasn't changed much since 2005. Emily and Jacob remain atop the list. Emily has been the top girls' name since 1996; Jacob for boys since 1999. The national trend surprised Cleveland Evans, a psychology professor and names expert at Bellevue University in Nebraska. But he said Katrina isn't likely to go extinct. "This is not going to be a name like Adolf that's going to disappear and be unusable ever again," he said, referring to that name's association with Adolf Hitler. Scarlett and Stephen Billis, a Los Angeles-area couple, named their daughter Katrina last May. Scarlett said the couple was reluctant to use the name less than a year after the hurricane, but her husband had always liked it as a variation of Katherine, a family name. Also, their family is Greek and the name is close to the popular Greek name Katerina. "People ask if we named her after the hurricane," Billis said. "We didn't pick it because of that and we were actually hesitant ... but we do joke that our house looks like a hurricane hit." The Social Security Administration's rankings, released each year just before Mother's Day, are based on some 4.2 million card applications from 2006. Social Security began compiling the name lists in 1997.

Modified to have a attribute for better module consistency. to allow specifying categorization scheme. for a human readable label. element for media binary hashing. to distinguish formatting of text. Improved descriptions of various elements and attributes. 08/22/2005 - Improved global syndication capabilities: [1.1.0] attributes to media:text and media:content. to give more flexibility to represent things other than people or companies. to explicitly determine what type of media is expressed. Added a "Best Practices" section to encourage use of the Feed History module, and Dublin Core's expiration capability. Add time code information to 10/22/2005 - Minor improvements: [1.1.1] Added capability for elements to appear at the to allow explicit global relationships to be expressed. The namespace for Media RSS is defined to be: "Media RSS" is a new RSS module that supplements the enclosure capabilities of RSS 2.0. RSS enclosures are already being used to syndicate audio files and images. Media RSS extends enclosures to handle other media types, such as short films or TV, as well as provide additional metadata with the media. Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of . It allows grouping of elements that are effectively the same content, yet different representations. For instance: the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3 format. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media. It contains 14 attributes, most of which are optional. should specify the direct url to the media object. If not included, a element must be specified. is the number of bytes of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the standard MIME type of the object. It is an optional attribute. is the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable). While this attribute can at times seem redundant if is supplied, it is included because it simplifies decision making on the reader side, as well as flushes out any ambiguities between MIME type and object type. It is an optional attribute. determines if this is the default object that should be used for the . There should only be one default object per . It is an optional attribute. determines if the object is a sample or the full version of the object, or even if it is a continuous stream (sample | full | nonstop). Default value is 'full'. It is an optional attribute. is the kilobits per second rate of media. It is an optional attribute. is the number of frames per second for the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of samples per second taken to create the media object. It is expressed in thousands of samples per second (kHz). It is an optional attribute. is number of audio channels in the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of seconds the media object plays. It is an optional attribute. is the height of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the width of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared. If this element is not included, it assumes that no restrictions are necessary. It has one optional attribute. r (cz 1 lz 1 nz 1 oz 1 vz 1) is the URI that identifies the rating scheme. It is an optional attribute. If this attribute is not included, the default scheme is urn:simple (adult | nonadult). The title of the particular media object. It has 1 optional attribute. The Judy's - The Moo Song specifies the type of text embedded. Possible values are either 'plain' or 'html'. Default value is 'plain'. All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. Short description describing the media object typically a sentence in length. It has 1 optional attribute. This was some really bizarre band I listened to as a young lad. specifies the type of text embedded. Possible values are either 'plain' or 'html'. Default value is 'plain'. All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. Highly relevant keywords describing the media object with typically a maximum of ten words. The keywords and phrases should be comma delimited. kitty, cat, big dog, yarn, fluffy Allows particular images to be used as representative images for the media object. If multiple thumbnails are included, and time coding is not at play, it is assumed that the images are in order of importance. It has 1 required attribute and 3 optional attributes. specifies the url of the thumbnail. It is a required attribute. specifies the height of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the width of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the time offset in relation to the media object. Typically this is used when creating multiple keyframes within a single video. The format for this attribute should be in the DSM-CC's Normal Play Time (NTP) as used in RTSP [ RFC 2326 3.6 Normal Play Time ]. It is an optional attribute. NTP has a second or subsecond resolution. It is specified as H:M:S.h (npt-hhmmss) or S.h (npt-sec), where H=hours, M=minutes, S=second and h=fractions of a second. A possible alternative to NTP would be SMPTE. It is believed that NTP is simpler and easier to use. Allows a taxonomy to be set that gives an indication of the type of media content, and its particular contents. It has 2 optional attributes. is the URI that identifies the categorization scheme. It is an optional attribute. If this attribute is not included, the default scheme is 'http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/category_schema'. is the human readable label that can be displayed in end user applications. It is an optional attribute. This is the hash of the binary media file. It can appear multiple times as long as each instance is a different . It has 1 optional attribute. indicates the algorithm used to create the hash. Possible values are 'md5' and 'sha-1'. Default value is 'md5'. It is an optional attribute. Allows the media object to be accessed through a web browser media player console. This element is required only if a direct media attribute is not specified in the element. It has 1 required attribute, and 2 optional attributes. is the url of the player console that plays the media. It is a required attribute. is the height of the browser window that the should be opened in. It is an optional attribute. is the width of the browser window that the should be opened in. It is an optional attribute. Notable entity and the contribution to the creation of the media object. Current entities can include people, companies, locations, etc. Specific entities can have multiple roles, and several entities can have the same role. These should appear as distinct elements. It has 2 optional attributes. role specifies the role the entity played. Must be lowercase. It is an optional attribute. is the URI that identifies the role scheme. It is an optional attribute. If this attribute is not included, the default scheme is 'urn:ebu'. See: European Broadcasting Union Role Codes. actor anchor person author choreographer composer conductor director editor graphic designer grip illustrator lyricist music arranger music group musician orchestra performer photographer producer reporter vocalist European Broadcasting Union Role Codes Copyright information for media object. It has 1 optional attribute. is the url for a terms of use page or additional copyright information. If the media is operating under a Creative Commons license, the Creative Commons module should be used instead. It is an optional attribute. Allows the inclusion of a text transcript, closed captioning, or lyrics of the media content. Many of these elements are permitted to provide a time series of text. In such cases, it is encouraged, but not required, that the elements be grouped by language and appear in time sequence order based on the time. Elements can have overlapping times. It has 4 optional attributes. Oh, say, can you see By the dawn's early light specifies the type of text embedded. Possible values are either 'plain' or 'html'. Default value is 'plain'. All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module. A movie review with a trailer, using a Creative Commons license. My Movie Review Site Movie Title: Is this a good movie? A music video with a link to a player window, and additional metadata about the video, including expiration date. Discussions of great videos The latest video from an artist Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light Several different songs that relate to the same topic. Discussion on different songs These songs make me think about blah Same song with multiple files at different bitrates and encodings. (Bittorrent example as well) Songs galore at different bitrates Cool song by an artist Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this specification, and to all those that sent suggestions and corrections.

News The 25 Best Affordable Suburbs in the U.S. Wed May 9, 8:08 AM ET Buying your first house? Fleeing the city for a life within your means? Here's a novel idea: Move to a suburb where you won't break the bank or get your car broken into. A community with reasonable home prices and decent schools. A suburb close to your city job, with a lively downtown of its own. For hedge-fund managers, plastic surgeons, corporate lawyers, and other people who earn millions a year, choosing a suburb is not about affordability but convenience and, frankly, prestige. These folks don't balk at high prices or look for fixer-uppers. They can pay for prime real estate on the most exclusive streets in the fanciest towns with the best schools. If they want to live in Greenwich or Brookline or Lake Forest or Malibu, they can. Unfortunately, most people aren't so lucky. Most people have to balance their real estate aspirations with reality--compromising on acreage or culture in exchange for better schools or lower property taxes. But that's no reason to give up and settle. Sure, you might own the cheapest house in a top suburb, but is that really worth it? Wouldn't it be better if you could live in a decent house and still send your kids to a good school? It's not hard if you know where to look. For every prosperous estate section or low-rent neighborhood, major metropolitan areas have communities nearby that offer the winning combination of affordability, academics, safety, and culture that most families dream about but can rarely find--within their budget. Working with Portland (Ore.)-based Web site Sperling's Best Places, BusinessWeek.com came up with a list of 25 affordable suburbs near the nation's largest metro areas. These suburbs may not have the greatest schools in the country, or the lowest crime rates, but most of them do better than average in these categories. The average secondary test scores index among our featured suburbs is 114, and the average violent crime index is 54 (with 100 being the state and national averages, respectively). These suburbs don't have the cheapest housing around, either, but none have median home prices over $619,000 (Santa Clarita, Calif.) or cost-of-living indexes over 172.1 (West Nyack, N.Y.). Sperling calculates that 100 is the national cost-of-living average. New York City, for example, has an average of 256.2. Paw Paw, W. Va., a town of less than 600 people with an average household income of around $25,000, has a cost of living average of 70.9. The suburb on our list with the lowest median home price and cost-of-living index is Coralville, Iowa, with $171,600 and 96.9, respectively. Although they vary in price and quality, all of our affordable suburbs are located within an hour's drive of a major U.S. city, and many have a vibrant downtown scene, with fine restaurants, sophisticated shopping, and seasonal festivals. "There are so many resources in a metro area," says Bert Sperling, founder and president of Sperling's Best Places and co-author of Best Places to Raise your Family: The Top 100 Affordable Communities in the U.S. He looks for places that suit the typical professional American family, making $50,000 or $60,000 a year. "People don't want to live in the middle of nowhere," he says. "I think Santa Barbara is a wonderful place to live, but maybe not for you and me," says Sperling, who helped BusinessWeek.com compile its list of the best affordable neighborhoods in the U.S. "We looked for places with a sense of identity and a good economy, and we excluded areas with economic problems and extremely high prices." Take West Nyack, N.Y., this year's best affordable New York City suburb. About a 30-minute drive from Manhattan, West Nyack is one of five villages and hamlets that make up an area on the western bank of the Hudson River known as "The Nyacks." The neighborhood, which has a median home price of $605,700 (vs. New York City's $963,700), is perhaps known best as the location of Palisades Center, the largest shopping mall in the New York metropolitan area. Those with more sophisticated tastes will enjoy browsing the shops in the neighboring town of Nyack, a popular destination for antique hunters. Twenty minutes by commuter rail from another Northeastern city lies Sharon, Mass., a growing Boston suburb of more than 18,000 people. Sharon residents love to swim, boat, and fish in Lake Massapoag, which is also the setting of an annual Independence Day fireworks display and regular musical performances. With a median home price of $493,900, life in Sharon is also much more economical than in the affluent communities of Brookline, Newton, and other towns closer to Boston. Still, Sharon's two best assets may be its stellar schools and religious diversity, according to longtime resident and Coldwell Banker real estate agent Judy Levye. "Our school system is no secret," Levye says, noting that 96% of Sharon High School seniors go on to college. "In fact, that is what drives in a large number of families." Affirmation of diversity is also key in Sharon, which has an Islamic mosque, several Jewish synagogues, and "every kind of church you can imagine" Levye adds. If the Northeast's concept of "affordable" housing still seems a bit beyond your reach, look no further than the West and Southwest, where towns like Kaysville, Utah, and Sandia Heights, N.M., offer many homes under $400,000 and even $300,000. "We've thought about moving but we haven't made the change. We couldn't replace what we have here anywhere else," says Melissa Coxey, a Realtor with Coldwell Banker and resident of Kaysville for over 20 years. Kaysville, a popular destination for those escaping the higher cost of living in nearby Salt Lake City, has one of the lowest median home price on our list, at $209,100--but this still spells status for many Utah homeowners. "Stuff doesn't last long here," says Coxey, who has been selling houses in the area for the past 10 years. "And part of the reason is to be able to say: I do live in Kaysville.'" Sandia Heights, N.M., is also home to many proud residents. The contemporary community, situated at the foot of the Sandia Mountains near Albuquerque, is filled with adobe homes and all-natural sagebrush-and-cactus landscaping. It has spectacular city and mountain views and some of the cleanest air in the country. Sixty-five percent of residents have graduate degrees, due to the high concentration of defense-related federal laboratories in the area. The property tax rate is just $7 per $1,000 of home value. "We're right next to a high-end city neighborhood with high taxes, but we pay county taxes," notes Max Sanchez, a sixth-generation New Mexican and a Realtor with Coldwell Banker. "Why would you want to live anywhere else?"

News LEDs emerge to fight fluorescents By PETER SVENSSON, AP Technology Writer Fri May 11, 2:52 PM ET NEW YORK - The light bulb, the symbol of bright ideas, doesn't look like such a great idea anymore, as lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad are talking about banning the century-old technology because of its contribution to global warming. But what comes next? Compact fluorescent bulbs are the only real alternative right now, but "bulbs" that use light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, are quickly emerging as a challenger. LEDs, which are small chips usually encased in a glass dome the size of a matchstick head, have been in use in electronics for decades to indicate, for example, whether a VCR is on or off. Those LEDs were usually red or green, but a scientific breakthrough in the 1990s paved the way for the production of LEDs that produce white light. Because they use less power than standard incandescent bulbs, white LEDs have become common in flashlights. Established players in the lighting industry and a host of startups are now grooming LEDs to take on the reigning champion of residential lighting, the familiar pear-shaped incandescent light bulb. The light bulb has been running out of friends recently. California and Canada have decided to ban the sale of incandescent bulbs by 2012. Australia is banning them in 2010. The is looking at banning production of the bulbs. A U.S. Senate committee is working on a proposal that would phase out the light bulb in 10 years. And in New Jersey, where the first practical incandescent bulb emerged from Thomas Edison's laboratory in 1879, a bill has been introduced to ban their use in government buildings. Governments are gunning for the light bulb because it's much less efficient than fluorescents, using about five times more energy to produce the same amount of light. Lighting consumes 22 percent of electricity produced in the U.S., according to the , and widespread use of LED lighting could cut consumption in half. By 2027, LED lighting could cut annual energy use by the equivalent of 500 million barrels of oil, with the attendant reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas believed to be responsible for global warming. Much of that reduction would be possible with today's technology, using compact fluorescents, or CFLs. But consumers haven't warmed to them. The light quality hasn't been satisfactory, most take time to turn on and aren't dimmable. The LED has advantages over the CFL in most of those areas, and judging by this week's Lightfair trade show in New York, it could be a serious challenge to the CFL in a few years. What holds it back is chiefly price, but LEDs are already an economic alternative for niche uses. In the last two years, the diodes have doubled in energy efficiency and brightness, according to Greg Merritt, director of marketing for Durham, N.C.-based LED-manufacturer Cree Inc. In particular, LEDs that produce a yellowish or "warm" light similar to incandescents have improved. Dallas-based Lighting Science Group Corp. showed an LED "bulb" that screws into a standard medium-sized socket and produces a warm light equivalent to that of a 25-watt incandescent bulb, but consumes just 5.8 watts. It costs $50, hardly palatable to consumers who can buy a standard bulb for less than a dollar. Polybrite International, a startup in Naperville, Ill., announced that lighting giant Osram Sylvania, a subsidiary of Germany's Siemens AG, will distribute its LED "bulbs." The intended market is mainly commercial clients, who can afford to pay $15 to $85 per unit, according to Osram Sylvania marketing manager Constance Pineault. The energy efficiency is no doubt a draw for commercial clients like hotels, but LEDs have another big advantage: they last up to 50,000 hours, according to manufacturers. That compares to about 10,000 hours for fluorescents and 1,000 hours for incandescents. Not having to send out janitors to replace burned-out bulbs means big savings in maintenance costs. "Right now the applications that make sense are either high maintenance or high power consumption, like parking garages, where the lights are on all the time," said Cree's Merritt. LEDs already beat fluorescents for energy efficiency in some niche uses. For instance, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is putting LED lighting in its in-store refrigerators, where the cold dims fluorescents and incandescents produce too much heat. LEDs also starting to replace flat fluorescent backlights in liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs, where they produce better colors. LEDs don't contain toxic mercury, which CFLs do, though the amount is very small. (Recent stories circulating on the Web about calling a hazmat team if a CFL breaks are exaggerated. The U.S. recommends sweeping up, not vacuuming, the fragments, then checking out local recycling options.) The cost of LED lighting should be coming down quickly. Polybrite founder Carl Scianna said the cost of individual white-light diodes, several of which go into an LED bulb and make up much of the cost, have come down in price from about $8 to $1.50 in a year. "They're going to keep going down," Scianna said. "By the middle of next year, they'll be priced for consumers." Nadarajah Narendran, director of lighting research at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., cautions that there are still technical issues to work out with LEDs. While single LEDs can demonstrate very high energy efficiency in the lab, when they're combined into fixtures, their efficiency is considerably lower. In part that's a heat issue: the diodes produce less heat than incandescents, but they keep that heat in the fixture rather than radiating it, and the hotter the diodes get, the less efficient they are. He sees screwing LED bulbs into standard sockets "as a waste of talent" that doesn't utilize the inherent properties of LEDs, like their small size and longevity. "You could build them in as part of the furniture, part of the cabinetry," Narendran said. Because of their high prices, he doesn't believe LEDs will be ready to replace incandescents in all their uses for the next five to 10 years, but "LEDs, good or bad, will be growing very rapidly."

News U.S. officials say Germany threat may involve Kurds By David Morgan and Kristin Roberts WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A threat warning issued by the United States in Germany last month could involve attack plans by an al Qaeda-affiliated group of Kurdish militants, officials said on Friday. U.S. and German authorities said, however, that there was no new threat in Germany beyond the official April 20 State Department warning. They were responding to a report by ABC News on its Web site on Friday that officials believe terrorists were in the advanced planning stages for an attack on U.S. military personnel or tourists in Germany. In the April 20 warning, the U.S. Embassy in Germany encouraged Americans in the country to increase their vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their personal security. "We&#39;re unaware of anything new. We have not changed our force posture," a U.S. defense official said on Friday. In Germany, the Interior Ministry said there had been no change in the security situation. "There is nothing new," a spokesman for the ministry said. "What we&#39;re looking at is the state of affairs that has been long since known. This caused the U.S. authorities to publish a warning to their own citizens in Germany." Counterterrorism officials in Europe and the United States have for weeks been investigating a suspected plot against U.S. interests in the country, which will host a G8 summit of major industrialized countries next month. U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said recent intelligence reports suggested possible involvement by Kurdish Islamists from outside Germany. The group is believed to be affiliated with al Qaeda but not formally a part of the militant network led by , they said. They had no specific information about targets or timing. Some German media reports have suggested involvement by Iraqi militants. However, U.S. officials rejected the notion of a role by Ansar al-Islam, a militant group of Iraqi Kurds and Arabs who have vowed to establish an independent Islamic state in "There is intelligence reporting suggesting there is a group interested in staging an attack, potentially in Germany," said a U.S. official who asked not to be named because the issue involves classified information. "The thinking is that this plot was beyond the talking stage, certainly," the official added. "The concerns are real, but not new." ABC News quoted German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble as saying, "The danger level is high. We are part of the global threat by Islamist terrorism." The ABC report, quoting U.S. and German law enforcement officials, said Patch Barracks, headquarters to the U.S. military&#39;s European Command, could be a target following reports that suspected terrorists had conducted surveillance at the facility. An official with U.S. European Command said there was no new intelligence strong enough to warrant heightened security at military facilities in Germany. "The threat condition has not been raised," the official said. "There&#39;s been no actionable intelligence." German Chancellor Angela Merkel will host the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States at the June 6-8 summit, which will focus on climate change, African poverty and economic cooperation. Schaeuble has said border controls have been tightened ahead of the summit.

News XM shock jocks apologize for sex comment 2 hours, 27 minutes ago WASHINGTON - XM Satellite Radio shock jocks Opie and Anthony apologized Friday for airing a homeless man's crude comments that he'd like to have sex with The remarks were made on their show Wednesday by a guest the duo call Homeless Charlie. As the name of each woman came up, the guest said he would like to have sex with her &#151; using language not fit for print. Opie and Anthony laughed as they imagined Rice's "horror" while describing a violent sexual encounter in which Rice is punched in the face. Washington-based XM condemned the remarks. "We deplore the comments made on Wednesday's 'Opie & Anthony Show,'" XM spokesman Nathaniel Brown told The Associated Press on Friday. He would not say whether XM planned to take disciplinary action. Opie and Anthony, whose full names are Anthony Cumia and Greg "Opie" Hughes, apologized to listeners on Friday's show. "We apologize to the public officials for comments that we made on our XM show on May 9th. We take very seriously the responsibility that comes with our creative freedom and regret any offense that this segment has caused," they said. Because the show airs on satellite radio, there are no federal restrictions on its content. According to XM's Web site, the radio service has parental controls that allow users to block access to channels that frequently contain explicit language. Those channels are designated with an "XL" notation. The same radio duo was dumped by CBS Radio in August 2002 for running a contest in which they said two listeners had sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. They were hired by XM in 2004. The remarks could become an issue as XM seeks approval from the to merge with New York-based Sirius Satellite Radio, said Tom Taylor, editor of the trade magazine Inside Radio. "XM and Sirius don't want any regulation," he said in Friday's New York Daily News. "But it's come up in four congressional hearings &#151; and at this point, the merger is such a close call, any issue could become important."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070510/tc_nm/heart_ipods_dc	iPods can make pacemakers malfunction: study - Yahoo! News iPods can make pacemakers malfunction: study Thu May 10, 4:07 PM ET CHICAGO (Reuters) - iPods can cause cardiac implantable pacemakers to malfunction by interfering with the electromagnetic equipment monitoring the heart, according to a study presented by a 17-year-old high school student to a meeting of heart specialists on Thursday. The study tested the effect of the portable music devices on 100 patients, whose mean age was 77, outfitted with pacemakers. Electrical interference was detected half of the time when the iPod was held just 2 inches from the patient&#39;s chest for 5 to 10 seconds. The study did not examine any portable music devices other than iPods, which are made by Apple Inc. In some cases, the iPods caused interference when held 18 inches from the chest. Interfering with the telemetry equipment caused the device to misread the heart&#39;s pacing and in one case caused the pacemaker to stop functioning altogether. The study was held at the Thoracic and Cardiovascular Institute at Michigan State University. The results were presented at the Heart Rhythm Society annual meeting in Denver. Jay Thaker, lead author of the study and a student at Okemos High School in Okemos, Michigan, concluded that iPod interference can lead physicians to misdiagnose actual heart function. Thaker, whose father is an electrophysiologist and whose mother is a rheumatologist, said he asked his dad about a potential interaction between pacemakers and iPods. "We looked online but didn&#39;t see anything. Then, one of his patients asked him if there would be a problem, so (my father) put me in touch with Dr. Krit (Jongnarangsin)," Thaker said in a telephone interview. Jongnarangsin, a long-time friend of Thaker&#39;s father, is the senior author of the study and an assistant professor in the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Michigan. "Most pacemaker patients are not iPod users," Jongnarangsin said. For that reason, he said, it is unclear how often iPods cause misdiagnosis. "This needs to be studied more," Jongnarangsin added. Thaker said he is interested in doing a similar study about how implantable cardioverter defibrillators, known as ICDs, are affected by iPods.

Calif. island fire turned from town By ANDREW GLAZER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:21 PM ET AVALON, Calif. - Firefighters turned back flames that threatened Santa Catalina Island's main city and some residents planned to return to their homes Friday after thousands were forced to evacuate a day earlier. The wildfire was 4,000 acres, or more than 6 square miles, and was only 10 percent contained early Friday. But worries were eased by the day's favorable weather forecast and the arrival of dozens of fire trucks and air tankers on the narrow, mountainous island 30 miles off Los Angeles. "Everyone is working very hard to make sure that the people are safe and the animals are safe," Gov. Most of the 76-square-mile island is owned by a land conservancy, home to wildlife including the Catalina Island fox, North American bison and bald eagle. Flames that had menaced the main city of Avalon the night before were no longer visible from there on Friday. But a layer of ash and a puff of smoke that rose from a hillside overlooking the crescent harbor were reminders of a harrowing night. "The risk has been reduced significantly," Fire Chief Steven Hoefs said. "Most of the structures have been protected." The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon in the island's rugged interior, feeding on dry brush and fanned by a steady wind into the night. One home and a few small structures in the canyons outside the city burned. About 3,800 residents and tourists fled, Schwarzenegger said. As people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries to the mainland, many covered their faces with towels and bandanas to ward off ashes. Resident Kathy Troeger fled with her three children and a friend's daughter, while her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to fight the blaze. "It was like a nightmare when we left," she said after arriving at the mainland port of Long Beach. "You couldn't breathe, and ash was falling like snow." Anita Bussing, a therapist who has a second home on the island, described a sky "completely gray with orange streaks." The helicopters were flying all over the place," she said. "People were freaking out, children were crying." Island hotel worker Susana Garcia, 22, waited long into the night at the dock looking for her father. She had gone to the mainland to do errands before the fire started and was unable to reach her father, who had stayed behind. "I've been asking everybody if they've seen him, but I haven't found him yet," Garcia said. Dozens of fire engines arrived through the night from as far away as Fresno, carried by giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton. One firefighter was overcome by inhalation and was in stable condition. Wind that reached 20 mph Thursday calmed and were expected to blow the fire westward, away from Avalon and toward the island's sparsely populated center. Despite being well offshore, Catalina has been left parched by the lack of rainfall that has made the rest of Southern California particularly susceptible to wildfires like the one in Los Angeles' Griffith Park this week. Television actor Steven W. Bailey, who lives near the park, had gone to Catalina with his wife to escape the smoke and heat on Thursday. As they approached the island, he spotted the smoke of the island blaze, and when they arrived, they weren't allowed to check into their hotel. "It just descended into more and more fire, more and more smoke, more and more ash," Bailey told KABC-TV. Firefighters were still working Friday to surround what remained of the Griffith Park fire, which briefly chased people from homes and threatened the park's landmark observatory and zoo. Elsewhere around the country, firefighters battled the second Georgia wildfire to burn more than 100,000 acres as gusty wind spread the fast-moving blaze further into northern Florida and toward the tiny town of Fargo west of the Okefenokee Swamp. Officials said the wildfire, ignited Saturday by lightning, had grown so rapidly that after six days it already rivaled a fire that has scorched 116,480 acres, or 182 square miles, of southeastern Georgia forest and swampland since April 16 &#151; the state's largest wildfire on record. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. A haze was seen in Miami, more than 300 miles away. To the north, a wildfire grew to nearly 86 square miles in northeastern Minnesota and across the border into Canada, cutting power and phone lines to many resorts and lake homes. The fire, driven by high wind Thursday and fed by drought-parched forest, has already destroyed 45 structures and was threatening about 200 more. The chance of desperately needed rainfall was still days away.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_as/japan_breast_feeding	Japan scraps plan to urge breast-feeding - Yahoo! News Japan scraps plan to urge breast-feeding Fri May 11, 2:07 PM ET TOKYO - A Japanese proposal to urge mothers to breast-feed their babies and sing lullabies to children was scrapped after critics warned it was too intrusive, a news report said. The proposal, which would also have recommended parents limit their children's television viewing and promote age-appropriate morals, was to have been announced Friday by an education reform panel named by the government. But experts and some government officials said the measure was "beyond intrusive," and interfered in people's private lives, Kyodo News agency said Thursday, citing unnamed individuals close to the panel. Japanese breastfeeding rates are much lower than those in other developed countries, according to various studies cited in a 2006 article in the International Breastfeeding Journal. The comparitive studies said in 2000 the full breastfeeding rate in Japan for infants aged 1 to 2 months was 44.8 percent compared to the U.S. rate of 54.7 percent at 1 month and and Sweden at 80.2 percent at 2 months. Another study of infants aged 3 to 6 months in Nishinomiya City, Japan, found that 43.8 percent of infants were fed breast milk only. These breast-feeding rates still remain lower than the U.S with 47 percent breastfed at 3 months. Education reform has been a key party of conservative Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's agenda since he took office in September. In December, Parliament passed a reform measure that called on schools to "to cultivate an attitude that respects tradition and culture, that loves the nation and home country." The legislation reflected concerns voiced by Abe that Japan's long stretch of economic prosperity has eroded the morals and cooperative spirit of prewar Japanese. Concerns have also been rife about Japan's falling birth rate. Earlier this month, the government said that Japan's child population has fallen to a record low since the end of World War II. To encourage more couples to have children, Abe's government has adopted plans for increasing child care, promoting gender equality and encouraging companies to allow staff more time for family responsibilities. But many opt to have few or no children because of the high cost of raising them and the persisting social expectations for women to quit their jobs after giving birth.

News Wis. farmer finds new calf has two noses 1 hour, 18 minutes ago MERRILL, Wis. - Mark Krombholz had to look twice at his new calf, Lucy &#151; one time for each nose. "I didn't notice anything too different about her until I got her in the barn," Krombholz said, "and all of a sudden I went to feed her a bottle of milk, and I thought maybe she'd been kicked in the nose and there were two noses there." The second, smaller nose sits on top of the first. "It's a functioning nose because the middle of her second nose, the flap would go in and out when she drank out of the bottle like that," Krombholz said. "It was kind of funny." Breeder Scott Grund said Lucy's noses seem to be working fine. "It looked like she was comfortable laying there in her bedding and breathing and spunky just like you want to see," Grund said. "It's just that she's got two noses." That kind of rare deformity is usually not the result of genetics, he said. But breeders do track such mutations. "We'll fill out a form, send that on to the company in Shawano and they will keep record of it," Grund said. "If by chance this would occur more than a few times, they would start looking at maybe the sire that we're using." Krombholz said Lucy, who was born May 4, will be a pet and bred if she's able.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_go_ot/postal_rates	Stamp prices to go up Monday - Yahoo! News Stamp prices to go up Monday By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 2:49 PM ET WASHINGTON - It will cost a bit more to mail letters and parcels starting Monday. A first-class letter will go up 2 cents to 41 cents. But there is also some good news &#151; folks will be able to buy "forever" stamps that remain valid regardless of any future increase. While the new rates take effect Monday, most post offices are closed on Sunday so officials say items dropped in a box that won't be collected until Monday should have the higher postage on them. On the other hand, when rates change the agency usually allows a little leeway, and it doesn't plan a rash of returns for insufficient postage. Postmaster General John Potter has said that even with the higher prices the agency expects a deficit this year as it struggles to compete in a swiftly changing communications market. For most people, the first-class rate has the greatest impact, covering cards and letters. While the first-class rate will rise from 39 cents to 41 cents for the first ounce, people sending heavier letters &#151; such as wedding invitations &#151; will see a reduction in the price. That's because each additional ounce will cost just 17 cents, down from the current 24 cents. That means a two-ounce letter will cost 58 cents to mail, compared with 63 cents now. Also expected to be attractive to many people is the forever stamp. The first forever stamps are selling for 41 cents apiece, but they won't have a price printed on them and they will remain valid for sending a letter regardless of any future increases. While a forever stamp will always be valid for mailing a latter, that doesn't mean the price won't go up. If rates were to increase to 45 cents, for example, that's what a forever stamp would sell for. But stamps already purchased at a lower cost could still be used without adding extra postage. International rates are also going up. Letters to Canada and Mexico will rise to 69 cents and to most other countries to 90 cents. Other international services are being redesigned to more closely resemble domestic rates, and the charges will vary by country. Prices based on size and shape are also included in the new domestic rates. For example, while a first-class regular envelope is 41 cents for the first ounce, the charge will be 90 cents for the first ounce of a large envelope and $1.13 for the first ounce of a first-class parcel.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/vegas_explosion	2 detained in Las Vegas bombing - Yahoo! News 2 detained in Las Vegas bombing By KEN RITTER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 2:31 PM ET LAS VEGAS - Two people were being held in connection with a deadly bombing at a Las Vegas Strip parking lot, police said Friday. One man was questioned as a "person of interest" after being detained on false identification charges, and his home was searched for clues in the bombing that killed an immigrant worker at a hot dog stand on Monday, police said. The homemade bomb had been left on the victim's car at Luxor hotel-casino's parking garage and went off after he picked it up. Police said a second person also was taken into custody but released no further information. The identity of the man who was detained was not made public after he was taken into custody Thursday evening. Police searched the man's home late Thursday "looking for anything tied to the case, including components that could be used to make an explosive device or any items that could tie him or others to the Luxor homicide," Cassell said. Police would not say what led them to the man. "He was detained for questioning," Cassell said. "He will be arrested on the warrants." The development came hours after police released blurry freeze-frame images of a car and appealed for public help to find it and the person who placed the deadly bomb. Police Lt. Lewis Roberts said Thursday that police were still trying to determine a motive for the explosion that mortally wounded 24-year-old Willebaldo Dorantes Antonio. Dorantes Antonio died at a hospital about two hours later of a head injury. A woman who was with Dorantes Antonio escaped injury. Police have said Dorantes Antonio was the intended target and the bombing was not a terrorist act or a mob hit. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said the motion-activated bomb blew up with the force of a stick of dynamite. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070510/ap_on_fe_st/odd_armless_driver	Armless, one-legged driver leads chase - Yahoo! News Armless, one-legged driver leads chase Thu May 10, 6:19 PM ET NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. - Authorities were led on a high speed vehicle chase by an armless, one-legged man, and they said this wasn't the first time the 40-year-old eluded police. Michael Francis Wiley taught himself to drive after losing both arms and a leg in an electrical accident when he was 13. He spent time in prison for kicking a Florida Highway Patrol trooper after an accident in 1996. He led police on a 120 mph chase in 1998. On Tuesday, Wiley sped off in a Ford Explorer when police approached him at a convenience store, New Port Richey police Capt. Darryl Garman said. Officers pursued, but called off the chase after eight minutes because they did not want to put others in danger, Garman said. Wiley was arrested the next day on charges of fleeing from police and habitually driving without a license. He also is awaiting trial on separate drug charges and traffic violations. He faces up to five years in prison if convicted. Defense attorney John Hooker said his client has paid off previous traffic fines that got his license suspended and tried to get a new driver's license, but he was rebuffed by state officials. Wiley's license has been revoked so many times it is now a felony to drive. "What makes him do it?" Hooker said when asked why Wiley keeps getting behind the wheel. "I think it's an urge he has that makes him feel as important and as good as anyone. It gives him a sense of self-esteem." Hooker said he had not had a chance to talk to Wiley about the most recent charges. Even before Wednesday's arrest, prosecutors were seeking to send Wiley to prison for at least five years for felony drug and traffic charges. "He has a hideous record," Assistant State Attorney Mike Halkitis said after an August 2006 arrest. "It's just got to end." Wiley was being held in the Pasco County jail on $500,000 bond.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ucda/20070508/lf_ucda/snackthievesarebustedbycreativecoworkers	SNACK THIEVES ARE BUSTED BY CREATIVE CO-WORKERS - Yahoo! News SNACK THIEVES ARE BUSTED BY CREATIVE CO-WORKERS By Abigail Van Buren Tue May 8, 7:57 PM ET DEAR ABBY: I couldn't help but add my two cents to the letter you printed from "Hungry in Madison Heights, Mich." (March 2), about the supervisor who stole everyone's food, candy, etc. At my job, we had the same problem. "Dan" would open people's drawers and eat whatever he found, too. He would even go into lunch bags. It didn't matter if you were sitting there or not -- if it was food, he was into it! One day a man who worked with him opened his desk drawer and realized that a tiny field mouse had gnawed through the wrapper of his candy bar and eaten part of it. He took the bar out of his desk and left it sitting there while he went to find someone to take care of the mouse. While he was gone, Dan entered his office, saw the candy, and took and ate it! Everyone except me was upset about him eating something that a mouse had nibbled. I was glad! Needless to say, Dan never took what wasn't his again. -- MAUREEN IN WEST CHICAGO DEAR MAUREEN: When I printed that letter from "Hungry," I had no idea how pervasive the problem is. Some readers suggested that the supervisor suffered from a compulsive eating disorder or undiagnosed diabetes. Others said he was simply a jerk. And here's how they dealt with it: DEAR ABBY: My husband was plagued by a co-worker who ate treats from his desk. I told him to set out some "cookies" I had just purchased at Petco. They look exactly like human cream cookies. My husband left them out when he knew the offender would be around, and then left the office. When he returned, sure enough -- the cookies were gone. Nothing was ever said, but he never raided my husband's desk again. -- GAYLE IN PORT ORCHARD, WASH. DEAR ABBY: I have a rather naughty solution for "Hungry in Madison Heights." Place a bowl of sugar-free candy on his desk. I guarantee the supervisor won't dip into it more than once before he learns about the way sorbitol acts on one's digestive system. -- NANCY IN FOWLER, OHIO DEAR ABBY: That letter brought back a memory that made me laugh. In order to prevent her brothers from chowing down on her personal snacks, my youngest daughter would -- in full view of them -- lightly lick the top of the cookies, container of popcorn, etc. After that, they wouldn't touch it! -- CAROL IN BEACON FALLS, CONN. DEAR ABBY: That supervisor is nothing more than a bully. He's using his position as their boss to belittle them and crush their egos into submission. He's stealing from them and damaging production potential by creating a hostile workplace. Perhaps if Human Resources saw the damage done in dollar signs, they would have been more helpful and paid attention to the complaints in the first place. The afflicted workers should sign statements attesting to what he has been doing and send them en masse to the man's supervisor. If nothing is done or retaliation occurs, legal action should be set in motion. -- BULLIED ONCE IN BUFFALO DEAR ABBY: If "Hungry's" co-workers are imaginative, the next time the supervisor opens a candy box in their desk drawers, the man will find six or eight copies of your column inside. -- DALE IN EL CERRITO, CALIF.

News German man found after 7 years dead in bed Fri May 11, 8:30 AM ET BERLIN (Reuters) - The decomposed corpse of a German man was found alone in his bed after nearly seven years, police in the western city of Essen said Thursday. The police said in a statement the man was 59 and unemployed at the time of his death. He most likely died of natural causes on November 30, 2000, the date he received a letter from the Welfare Office found in the apartment, police said. Next to the dead man&#39;s bed police found cigarettes, an open television guide and Deutschemark coins, which came out of circulation after the euro was introduced in 2002. The man&#39;s apartment was in a building with offices and apartments, many of which are now empty. "No one missed him. No missing person report was ever filed," the police said.

News Scientist: Don&#39;t Trust Sunscreen Fri May 11, 9:50 AM ET The latest skin-cancer prevention advice is to stop trusting sunscreen as the front line of defense against harmful rays. Instead, wear sunblocking clothing or stay out of the sun altogether, experts say. Sunscreen has been shown to protect against UV skin damage as well as basal carcinomas and squamous cell carcinoma&mdash;two of the three most common skin cancers . However, it has not been conclusively shown to protect against , the most fatal kind, said Stephan Lautenschlager of the Outpatient Clinic of Dermatology at Triemli Hospital in Switzerland. Lautenschlager and his colleagues carried out a comprehensive review on worldwide, recently detailed online in the journal Lancet. "Wearing sun-protective clothing and a hat and reducing sun exposure to a minimum should be preferred to sunscreens," Lautenschlager said. People tend to sunbathe for social reasons, he said. "Nevertheless, sunscreens should not be abused in an attempt to increase time in the sun to a maximum." The best clothing for sun protection is tightly woven, thick garments made of denim, wool or polyester, not cotton, linen or acetate, he said. Dry material or clothes that have shrunk after washing are denser and better at blocking UV rays than wet, stretched or bleached clothing. Outdoors, wear sunscreen and lots of it. Zinc or titanium oxide sunscreens scatter UV light and yield fewer allergies, so they are better for children, he said. The more common sunscreen lotions, called organic sunscreens, absorb UV rays. "The application of a liberal quantity of sunscreen is by far the most important factor for effectiveness of the sunscreen, followed by the uniformity of application and the specific absorption spectrum of the agent used," Lautenschlager said. That is, don&#39;t treat the stuff like liquid gold. Smear it on. A shot glass-full should be applied 15 to 30 minutes before heading outdoors. Look at your skin While four out of five people are concerned about skin , more than half have never been screened for skin cancer (54 percent) and nearly one quarter (23 percent) never examine their skin for changes to moles and blemishes, according to a recent survey by the American Academy of Dermatology. More than 1 million new cases of skin cancer will be diagnosed this year, the AAD says, but when detected early, even To check yourself, regular inspect all your skin, including the back, scalp, buttocks, soles of the feet, between the toes and the palms of the hands. Use mirrors when necessary. Other tips from the AAD: Seek shade if you must be outdoors during the sun&#39;s strongest hours, between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Avoid .

News Dog gets medal for saving kids Tue May 8, 2:53 AM ET WELLINGTON (AFP) - Nine-year-old Jack Russell terrier George is being honoured with a posthumous bravery medal for saving five New Zealand children from an attack by two pitbulls. The medal from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) comes after US Vietnam veteran Jerrell Hudman said he was sending his Purple Heart medal to George&#39;s owner after hearing of the dog&#39;s bravery. George, who had a heart problem, won fame after defending five children from the pitbulls in the small North Island town of Manaia a week and a half ago. The two pitbulls rushed at the five children on the street, prompting George to charge the much larger dogs as the children escaped. The Jack Russell was badly mauled by the two pitbulls and later had to be put down because of his extensive injuries. The two pitbulls were also put down. The SPCA medal is usually awarded to people for their bravery in defending animals. "George was a very brave little dog who almost certainly prevented severe injury, if not death, to at least one of the children," SPCA chief executive Robyn Kippenberger said. "It&#39;s truly tragic that he paid with his own life for his instinctive act of courage." Hudman, 58, of Austin, Texas was a US Marine for 30 years and said he decided to send his Purple Heart to George&#39;s owner Alan Gay after reading the news on the Internet because the dog was "a little warrior".

News Army tries incentives to keep officers By LOLITA C. BALDOR, Associated Press Writer Sat May 12, 5:10 AM ET WASHINGTON - The Army will offer incentives to keep midlevel officers as it faces another decade or so in combat around the world, its chief of staff said Friday. Gen. George Casey, who took over as the Army's chief just a month ago, said the United States will "be in a period of conflict for, I believe, another five or ten years." And the Army, which has been stretched and stressed by five difficult years at war, must be organized and equipped to deal with that challenge, he said. The general said he is not suggesting that the wars will last five more years. But Casey, who was the top commander in Iraq until February, acknowledged that building a stable, self-governing Iraq is a "long-term proposition." "We have been attacked and are at war with an insidious group of transnational terrorists who are attacking our way of life, and are going to continue to attack our way of life until we beat them, because I don't see them giving up," he said. To stem a growing trend of critical future leaders leaving the service, Casey said the Army will unveil a plan next week to give some captains $20,000 to stay on. He said the Army also will increase opportunities for officers to go to various graduate schools as another incentive to stay in the military. The captains also would get a choice in duty assignments. Casey said leadership development is one of his priorities, along with increasing the size of the Army, improving conditions for soldiers and their families and continuing to transform the service so it can better fight future battles. According to the Army, the attrition rate for officers is higher than it has been in previous years, with graduates of West Point, the Officer Candidate School and ROTC leaving at a faster pace once they've finished their initial tour in the military. For example, about six in 10 West Point soldiers who graduated in 1997 reenlisted after their sixth year. But just 53 percent of those who graduated in 2000 &#151; and likely have spent much of the last six years rotating in and out of the war zones &#151; have signed up for another tour. Casey, who served as the Iraq commander from July 2004 until February 2007, said he doesn't know how long the Army can keep up current troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan. But, he said, "it's a question I have foremost in my mind." He acknowledged that soldiers' families are upset about the 's recent decision to extend Iraq deployments to 15 months, from what had usually been 12 months. But he said the move was the only way to avoid sending as many as five Army brigades back to Iraq after just seven or eight months at home, resting and getting the equipment and training needed to return to war. Under the new system, units are guaranteed 12 months at home. The Pentagon released a one-page description Friday of the new deployment policy signed by Defense Secretary Robert Gates stating that units are guaranteed the one-year break. But it noted that a policy for individual soldiers has not yet been completed. Some soldiers returning from Iraq may change to a new unit or switch jobs which could result in their being sent back to the war zone in less than 12 months. The Army is working on a policy that would address those instances as much as possible. In other comments, Casey said he is still considering moving faster to increase the size of the Army but said he would have to shift money from future years in order to buy enough equipment for the expanded Army, as well as set up more recruiting centers. He said he does not yet know how much money it would take. Casey also said the Army is near a decision on how many mine-resistant armored vehicles to buy to replace the more vulnerable Humvees. The number is "somewhere between 2,500 and 17,000." The Army wants more of the so-called MRAPs (Mine Resistant, Ambush Protected), but acknowledges there are missions for which the vehicle is not suitable or as agile as needed.

He acknowledged that soldiers' families are upset about the 's recent decision to extend Iraq deployments to 15 months, from what had usually been 12 months. But he said the move was the only way to avoid sending as many as five Army brigades back to Iraq after just seven or eight months at home, resting and getting the equipment and training needed to return to war. Under the new system, units are guaranteed 12 months at home. The Pentagon released a one-page description Friday of the new deployment policy signed by Defense Secretary Robert Gates stating that units are guaranteed the one-year break. But it noted that a policy for individual soldiers has not yet been completed. Some soldiers returning from Iraq may change to a new unit or switch jobs which could result in their being sent back to the war zone in less than 12 months. The Army is working on a policy that would address those instances as much as possible. In other comments, Casey said he is still considering moving faster to increase the size of the Army but said he would have to shift money from future years in order to buy enough equipment for the expanded Army, as well as set up more recruiting centers. He said he does not yet know how much money it would take. Casey also said the Army is near a decision on how many mine-resistant armored vehicles to buy to replace the more vulnerable Humvees. The number is "somewhere between 2,500 and 17,000." The Army wants more of the so-called MRAPs (Mine Resistant, Ambush Protected), but acknowledges there are missions for which the vehicle is not suitable or as agile as needed.

News South Chilean penguin strays to Peru Fri May 11, 4:11 PM ET LIMA (AFP) - A Magellanic penguin has stunned scientists by showing up in Peru, some 5,000 kilometers (3,000 miles) from home in southern Chile. The penguin "got off course," said Miguel Lleellish, of the National Institute of Natural Resources told AFP. The penguin appeared to have been acting alone and not as part of a migration, he said. A native of the chilly Strait of Magellan region of southern Argentina and southern Chile, the flightless bird somehow swam all the way to Paracas National Reserve, just 14 degrees south of the Equator. The temperature of the Magellanic penguin&#39;s normal habitat is about eight degrees C (46 degrees F) while Peru&#39;s temperature is a warmer 14 degrees C (57 degrees F), biologist David Orosco told AFP. He said the lone bird was not a harbinger of mass migrations due to global warming; the penguin would not be seeking warmer climate, in that case. The bird, so far unnamed, has taken up residence in the reserve, but Orosco fears that the undue attention could be worse for the penguin than the change in climate, possibly causing a fatal case of stress. The Magellanic penguin may not fit in with Peru&#39;s 4,000 Humboldt penguins, and for all Orosco knows, the native birds could turn on it. He is contacting Chilean colleagues about the possibility of returning the penguin to its frozen, stress-free home. "Conditions in the park are not the ones it is used to. They usually seek out their own species, and it could suffer discrimination," he said. "It would be better for it to go to Chile."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070512/ap_on_el_pr/obama_medicare	Obama assails private Medicare plans - Yahoo! News Obama assails private Medicare plans By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer Sat May 12, 5:46 AM ET DES MOINES, Iowa - Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama ( ) on Friday proposed cutting government subsidies to private insurance companies under Medicare by $150 billion over the next decade. Campaigning for support in next winter's caucuses, Obama said the money could be used to strengthen the Medicare program overall, including a reduction in the prices seniors pay for prescription drug prices. "We don't do that because we are not setting the agenda in Washington, insurance companies and drug companies are. That's what people want to turn the page on," the Illinois senator said to loud applause. "We want a system that's fair and sensible to everyone." Obama's campaign said more than 53,000 Iowans are enrolled in private plans under the so-called Medicare Advantage program. They likely would face a reduction in coverage or an increase in out-of-pocket costs if the government cut its payments to the insurance companies. Supporters of these programs nationally say they provide additional benefits, such as eyeglass coverage, and often offer better care than the government-run program. Critics contend the government's subsidies are far too generous for the care provided, and should be reduced. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent group that advises Congress on the program, estimates that the government pays $112 a year to cover a Medicare beneficiary in a private plan for every $100 it pays for the traditional fee for service program. Obama proposed eliminating the difference. At least part of the gap results from legislation that Congress passed in recent years to increase payments in rural areas, an attempt to make sure seniors in sparsely populated regions have a choice of health care. In a written statement accompanying his appearance, Obama said, "we shouldn't be rewarding the insurance industry for deceiving and defrauding our seniors, we should be doing everything we can to stop them." A campaign spokesman, Bill Burton, said the Illinois Democrat did not intend to label all insurance companies operating Medicare Advantage plans as deceitful. "Besides some bad actors here, as MedPAC, the independent body that advises Congress on this issue, has pointed out, these overpayments appear to be driving up Medicare costs," he said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070511/lf_nm/japan_ethanol_dc	Sake may power cars in the future - Yahoo! News Sake may power cars in the future Fri May 11, 4:55 PM ET SHINANOMACHI, Japan (Reuters) - Japanese motorists may one day pump their cars full of sake, the fermented rice wine that is Japan&#39;s national drink, if a pilot project to create sake fuel is a hit with locals in this mountain resort. The government-funded project at Shinanomachi, 200 kilometres (124 miles) northwest of Tokyo, will produce cheap rice-origin ethanol brew with the help of local farmers who will donate farm waste such as rice hulls to be turned into ethanol. "We want to present the next generation a preferable blue print -- a self-sustainable use of local fuels," said Yasuo Igarashi, a professor of applied microbiology at the University of Tokyo who heads the three year project. If the project catches on with locals then it could pave the way for similar endeavours across Japan that will see Japanese cars running on Japanese-made biofuels in the future, he added. Japan, the world&#39;s second largest gasoline consumer after the United States, is entirely dependent on crude oil imports and it has been hit by the surge in oil prices. With hefty carbon emissions reduction targets to meet under the Kyoto protocols, Japan is turning to biofuels. Yet motorists in Japan are still far behind drivers in Europe and the United States in their consumption of green fuels. Some analysts say Japan is at a major disadvantage as high prices for local farm produce mean locally-made green fuels are exorbitantly expensive. Added to that is a lack of support from the country&#39;s powerful oil distributors and a failure by the government to provide policy incentives such as mandatory usage. That is where Igarashi and his team come in. They hope to show that biofuels are feasible and inexpensive by developing a low-cost fuel and encouraging a local community of about 10,000 people to take part in producing that fuel. SWEET AROMA OF BIOFUELS Production has just begun at the facility at a former high school field in Shinanomachi and a sweet, sour aroma, similar to that of unfiltered sake, wafts into the air. "We like the idea," said Shigehiro Matsuki, the mayor of Shinanomachi. "The new fuels are renewable... instead of fossil fuels which are running out." Unlike spacious sugar cane plantations in the No.1 ethanol exporter, Brazil, family farming is dominant in Japan, with a majority of farmers working regular jobs and growing rice, the staple food, on their weekends. There is plenty of potential to develop biofuels from agriculture waste and abandoned farmland, Igarashi said. The project will test its biofuel on a "flex-fuel vehicle," which can run on any mixture of gasoline and green fuels and which is gaining popularity in the rest of the world as the battle against global warming heats up. But Japan has no flex-fuel vehicles even though Japanese car companies Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and Toyota Motor Corp. produce them for the market in Brazil. So the team imported a red Ford Focus from Britain for the project. With one 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of rice needed to produce 0.5 litre of ethanol, the main challenge will be creating a low cost biofuel that can compete with ordinary gasoline, which is now sold at around 135 yen (&#36;1.13) a litre, including gasoline related taxes of some 56 yen.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/bw/20070509/bs_bw/nov2006db20061116063534	The 25 Best Affordable Suburbs in the U.S. - Yahoo! News The 25 Best Affordable Suburbs in the U.S. Wed May 9, 8:08 AM ET Buying your first house? Fleeing the city for a life within your means? Here's a novel idea: Move to a suburb where you won't break the bank or get your car broken into. A community with reasonable home prices and decent schools. A suburb close to your city job, with a lively downtown of its own. For hedge-fund managers, plastic surgeons, corporate lawyers, and other people who earn millions a year, choosing a suburb is not about affordability but convenience and, frankly, prestige. These folks don't balk at high prices or look for fixer-uppers. They can pay for prime real estate on the most exclusive streets in the fanciest towns with the best schools. If they want to live in Greenwich or Brookline or Lake Forest or Malibu, they can. Unfortunately, most people aren't so lucky. Most people have to balance their real estate aspirations with reality--compromising on acreage or culture in exchange for better schools or lower property taxes. But that's no reason to give up and settle. Sure, you might own the cheapest house in a top suburb, but is that really worth it? Wouldn't it be better if you could live in a decent house and still send your kids to a good school? It's not hard if you know where to look. For every prosperous estate section or low-rent neighborhood, major metropolitan areas have communities nearby that offer the winning combination of affordability, academics, safety, and culture that most families dream about but can rarely find--within their budget. Working with Portland (Ore.)-based Web site Sperling's Best Places, BusinessWeek.com came up with a list of 25 affordable suburbs near the nation's largest metro areas. These suburbs may not have the greatest schools in the country, or the lowest crime rates, but most of them do better than average in these categories. The average secondary test scores index among our featured suburbs is 114, and the average violent crime index is 54 (with 100 being the state and national averages, respectively). These suburbs don't have the cheapest housing around, either, but none have median home prices over $619,000 (Santa Clarita, Calif.) or cost-of-living indexes over 172.1 (West Nyack, N.Y.). Sperling calculates that 100 is the national cost-of-living average. New York City, for example, has an average of 256.2. Paw Paw, W. Va., a town of less than 600 people with an average household income of around $25,000, has a cost of living average of 70.9. The suburb on our list with the lowest median home price and cost-of-living index is Coralville, Iowa, with $171,600 and 96.9, respectively. Although they vary in price and quality, all of our affordable suburbs are located within an hour's drive of a major U.S. city, and many have a vibrant downtown scene, with fine restaurants, sophisticated shopping, and seasonal festivals. "There are so many resources in a metro area," says Bert Sperling, founder and president of Sperling's Best Places and co-author of Best Places to Raise your Family: The Top 100 Affordable Communities in the U.S. He looks for places that suit the typical professional American family, making $50,000 or $60,000 a year. "People don't want to live in the middle of nowhere," he says. "I think Santa Barbara is a wonderful place to live, but maybe not for you and me," says Sperling, who helped BusinessWeek.com compile its list of the best affordable neighborhoods in the U.S. "We looked for places with a sense of identity and a good economy, and we excluded areas with economic problems and extremely high prices." Take West Nyack, N.Y., this year's best affordable New York City suburb. About a 30-minute drive from Manhattan, West Nyack is one of five villages and hamlets that make up an area on the western bank of the Hudson River known as "The Nyacks." The neighborhood, which has a median home price of $605,700 (vs. New York City's $963,700), is perhaps known best as the location of Palisades Center, the largest shopping mall in the New York metropolitan area. Those with more sophisticated tastes will enjoy browsing the shops in the neighboring town of Nyack, a popular destination for antique hunters. Twenty minutes by commuter rail from another Northeastern city lies Sharon, Mass., a growing Boston suburb of more than 18,000 people. Sharon residents love to swim, boat, and fish in Lake Massapoag, which is also the setting of an annual Independence Day fireworks display and regular musical performances. With a median home price of $493,900, life in Sharon is also much more economical than in the affluent communities of Brookline, Newton, and other towns closer to Boston. Still, Sharon's two best assets may be its stellar schools and religious diversity, according to longtime resident and Coldwell Banker real estate agent Judy Levye. "Our school system is no secret," Levye says, noting that 96% of Sharon High School seniors go on to college. "In fact, that is what drives in a large number of families." Affirmation of diversity is also key in Sharon, which has an Islamic mosque, several Jewish synagogues, and "every kind of church you can imagine" Levye adds. If the Northeast's concept of "affordable" housing still seems a bit beyond your reach, look no further than the West and Southwest, where towns like Kaysville, Utah, and Sandia Heights, N.M., offer many homes under $400,000 and even $300,000. "We've thought about moving but we haven't made the change. We couldn't replace what we have here anywhere else," says Melissa Coxey, a Realtor with Coldwell Banker and resident of Kaysville for over 20 years. Kaysville, a popular destination for those escaping the higher cost of living in nearby Salt Lake City, has one of the lowest median home price on our list, at $209,100--but this still spells status for many Utah homeowners. "Stuff doesn't last long here," says Coxey, who has been selling houses in the area for the past 10 years. "And part of the reason is to be able to say: I do live in Kaysville.'" Sandia Heights, N.M., is also home to many proud residents. The contemporary community, situated at the foot of the Sandia Mountains near Albuquerque, is filled with adobe homes and all-natural sagebrush-and-cactus landscaping. It has spectacular city and mountain views and some of the cleanest air in the country. Sixty-five percent of residents have graduate degrees, due to the high concentration of defense-related federal laboratories in the area. The property tax rate is just $7 per $1,000 of home value. "We're right next to a high-end city neighborhood with high taxes, but we pay county taxes," notes Max Sanchez, a sixth-generation New Mexican and a Realtor with Coldwell Banker.

News The 25 Best Affordable Suburbs in the U.S. Wed May 9, 8:08 AM ET Buying your first house? Fleeing the city for a life within your means? Here's a novel idea: Move to a suburb where you won't break the bank or get your car broken into. A community with reasonable home prices and decent schools. A suburb close to your city job, with a lively downtown of its own. For hedge-fund managers, plastic surgeons, corporate lawyers, and other people who earn millions a year, choosing a suburb is not about affordability but convenience and, frankly, prestige. These folks don't balk at high prices or look for fixer-uppers. They can pay for prime real estate on the most exclusive streets in the fanciest towns with the best schools. If they want to live in Greenwich or Brookline or Lake Forest or Malibu, they can. Unfortunately, most people aren't so lucky. Most people have to balance their real estate aspirations with reality--compromising on acreage or culture in exchange for better schools or lower property taxes. But that's no reason to give up and settle. Sure, you might own the cheapest house in a top suburb, but is that really worth it? Wouldn't it be better if you could live in a decent house and still send your kids to a good school? It's not hard if you know where to look. For every prosperous estate section or low-rent neighborhood, major metropolitan areas have communities nearby that offer the winning combination of affordability, academics, safety, and culture that most families dream about but can rarely find--within their budget. Working with Portland (Ore.)-based Web site Sperling's Best Places, BusinessWeek.com came up with a list of 25 affordable suburbs near the nation's largest metro areas. These suburbs may not have the greatest schools in the country, or the lowest crime rates, but most of them do better than average in these categories. The average secondary test scores index among our featured suburbs is 114, and the average violent crime index is 54 (with 100 being the state and national averages, respectively). These suburbs don't have the cheapest housing around, either, but none have median home prices over $619,000 (Santa Clarita, Calif.) or cost-of-living indexes over 172.1 (West Nyack, N.Y.). Sperling calculates that 100 is the national cost-of-living average. New York City, for example, has an average of 256.2. Paw Paw, W. Va., a town of less than 600 people with an average household income of around $25,000, has a cost of living average of 70.9. The suburb on our list with the lowest median home price and cost-of-living index is Coralville, Iowa, with $171,600 and 96.9, respectively. Although they vary in price and quality, all of our affordable suburbs are located within an hour's drive of a major U.S. city, and many have a vibrant downtown scene, with fine restaurants, sophisticated shopping, and seasonal festivals. "There are so many resources in a metro area," says Bert Sperling, founder and president of Sperling's Best Places and co-author of Best Places to Raise your Family: The Top 100 Affordable Communities in the U.S. He looks for places that suit the typical professional American family, making $50,000 or $60,000 a year. "People don't want to live in the middle of nowhere," he says. "I think Santa Barbara is a wonderful place to live, but maybe not for you and me," says Sperling, who helped BusinessWeek.com compile its list of the best affordable neighborhoods in the U.S. "We looked for places with a sense of identity and a good economy, and we excluded areas with economic problems and extremely high prices." Take West Nyack, N.Y., this year's best affordable New York City suburb. About a 30-minute drive from Manhattan, West Nyack is one of five villages and hamlets that make up an area on the western bank of the Hudson River known as "The Nyacks." The neighborhood, which has a median home price of $605,700 (vs. New York City's $963,700), is perhaps known best as the location of Palisades Center, the largest shopping mall in the New York metropolitan area. Those with more sophisticated tastes will enjoy browsing the shops in the neighboring town of Nyack, a popular destination for antique hunters. Twenty minutes by commuter rail from another Northeastern city lies Sharon, Mass., a growing Boston suburb of more than 18,000 people. Sharon residents love to swim, boat, and fish in Lake Massapoag, which is also the setting of an annual Independence Day fireworks display and regular musical performances. With a median home price of $493,900, life in Sharon is also much more economical than in the affluent communities of Brookline, Newton, and other towns closer to Boston. Still, Sharon's two best assets may be its stellar schools and religious diversity, according to longtime resident and Coldwell Banker real estate agent Judy Levye. "Our school system is no secret," Levye says, noting that 96% of Sharon High School seniors go on to college. "In fact, that is what drives in a large number of families." Affirmation of diversity is also key in Sharon, which has an Islamic mosque, several Jewish synagogues, and "every kind of church you can imagine" Levye adds. If the Northeast's concept of "affordable" housing still seems a bit beyond your reach, look no further than the West and Southwest, where towns like Kaysville, Utah, and Sandia Heights, N.M., offer many homes under $400,000 and even $300,000. "We've thought about moving but we haven't made the change. We couldn't replace what we have here anywhere else," says Melissa Coxey, a Realtor with Coldwell Banker and resident of Kaysville for over 20 years. Kaysville, a popular destination for those escaping the higher cost of living in nearby Salt Lake City, has one of the lowest median home price on our list, at $209,100--but this still spells status for many Utah homeowners. "Stuff doesn't last long here," says Coxey, who has been selling houses in the area for the past 10 years. "And part of the reason is to be able to say: I do live in Kaysville.'" Sandia Heights, N.M., is also home to many proud residents. The contemporary community, situated at the foot of the Sandia Mountains near Albuquerque, is filled with adobe homes and all-natural sagebrush-and-cactus landscaping. It has spectacular city and mountain views and some of the cleanest air in the country. Sixty-five percent of residents have graduate degrees, due to the high concentration of defense-related federal laboratories in the area. The property tax rate is just $7 per $1,000 of home value. "We're right next to a high-end city neighborhood with high taxes, but we pay county taxes," notes Max Sanchez, a sixth-generation New Mexican and a Realtor with Coldwell Banker.

The police said in a statement the man was 59 and unemployed at the time of his death. He most likely died of natural causes on November 30, 2000, the date he received a letter from the Welfare Office found in the apartment, police said. Next to the dead man&#39;s bed police found cigarettes, an open television guide and Deutschemark coins, which came out of circulation after the euro was introduced in 2002.

News New domain names could come in mid-2008 By ANICK JESDANUN, AP Internet Writer Fri May 11, 3:44 PM ET NEW YORK - New Internet addresses for general use could start appearing in the summer of 2008 under a timeline the Internet's key oversight agency announced Thursday. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers invited public comment on procedures for creating new names, the first expansion for general use since 2000. Names added since then have been limited to specific regions or industries. "This is all about choice," Chief Executive Paul Twomey said in a statement. "We want the diversity of the world's people, geography and business to be able to be represented in the domain name system." Domain names are key for helping computers find Web sites and route e-mail. There are currently about 250 domain name suffixes, most of them for specific countries such as ".fr" for France. General-use names include ".com" and ".net." In 2000, two years after its designation by the U.S. government as the authority for overseeing Internet naming policies, ICANN approved seven new names, but only ".info" and ".biz" were truly for general use. ICANN solicited additional applications in 2004 and has approved six regional or industry-specific names, such as ".travel" and ".asia," while rejecting ".xxx" for the adult entertainment industry. Also added were .jobs, .mobi, .cat, and .tel. Some ICANN critics have complained that the agency has been slow to approve new names and that the procedures have sometimes been arbitrary. Businesses and trademark owners, meanwhile, worry that more names will lead to more cybersquatting, the practice of grabbing names before companies can in hopes of selling them at a premium. ICANN did not specify how individuals and groups would be able to seek new names, but the group indicated that the procedures would be streamlined to permit "a much wider variety of them to be added in a timely, predictable and efficient manner." An ICANN committee, the Generic Names Supporting Organization, still is reviewing the procedures. Once it sends a recommendation to the ICANN board, procedures could be adopted by year's end and applications for new names could be accepted early next year. Twomey said new names could be reviewed and added into the system in the June-August 2008 timeframe. The new addresses are likely to be in English. ICANN could wrap up the technical work on non-Latin scripts by year's end, but it still must resolve policy questions such as who should decide what countries get what suffixes and how to make sure a domain in one language isn't inadvertently offensive in another.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070512/ap_on_re_as/pakistan_judicial_crisis	18 killed in Pakistan political violence - Yahoo! News 18 killed in Pakistan political violence By ZARAR KHAN, Associated Press Writer KARACHI, Pakistan - Gunbattles and attacks killed at least 18 people and wounded dozens Saturday as Pakistan's political crisis descended into violence between rival parties over President Gen. Pervez Musharraf's suspension of the chief justice. Pro-government and opposition activists fought street battles in at least four parts of the sprawling city, and traded assault rifle fire in a residential area of bungalows and concrete apartment blocks just a half mile from Karachi's international airport. A private TV network came under fire, but stayed on air as rioters torched vehicles outside. The fighting broke out as Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry arrived for what organizers hoped would be the largest in two months of rallies by lawyers and opposition parties protesting his ouster. Pro-government parties were responding with their own shows of strength. The judge refused an offer from authorities to travel to the planned downtown rally by helicopter and was stranded at the airport &#151; as were hundreds of passengers from earlier flights &#151; by the makeshift roadblocks surrounding it, as well as at least one gunfight a half-mile away. Witnesses said that shipping containers, trucks and oil tankers, many with deflated tires, had been parked on key roads in Karachi overnight &#151; apparently to obstruct Chaudhry's supporters from welcoming the judge at the airport. No planes were taking off or landing. A few dozen lawyers walked to the airport anyway to greet Chaudhry, chanting, "We are with you! Down with Musharraf!" "The chief justice will only go to the city by road," said Aitzaz Ahsan, an attorney for Chaudhry. Musharraf on Saturday ruled out declaring a state of emergency in response to the turmoil sparked by his March 9 suspension of Chaudhry. In comments reported by the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan news agency, the military leader urged the nation to stand united and remain peaceful. Officials contacted at three hospitals in Karachi reported at least 18 people had died in the violence and 55 were wounded. Police reported more than 70 wounded, many from gunfire. Opposition activists accused a pro-government party, the Mutahida Qami Movement (MQM), of attacking them with batons and gunfire as they attempted to greet the judge at Karachi airport. An AP reporter could see MQM supporters calling for ammunition and firing from buildings; opposition supporters were firing back. Wasim Akhtar, an MQM official with the provincial government, urged the chief justice to go back to Islamabad to avoid further violence. Musharraf, who took power in a bloodless coup in 1999 and is still army chief, was due to address a huge gathering in the capital Islamabad later Saturday that organizers expected would draw over 300,000 ruling party supporters. Speaking earlier in the day, Musharraf made no explicit mention of the Karachi violence, but ruled out declaring a state of emergency &#151; which some analysts have suggested would let him cling onto power if his efforts to seek a new presidential term flounder. "There is absolutely no requirement and absolutely no environment for taking such drastic measure," Musharraf was quoted as saying. But the government's failure to contain the unrest in Karachi, despite the presence of 15,000 security forces, will deepen the political turmoil gripping Pakistan. Gunshots were heard across the city of 15 million, which has a history of militancy and political violence. Abdul Rahman Akhund, a leader of the opposition Awami National Party, said at least five of their supporters had been wounded in MQM firing. Baton-wielding MQM supporters were also accused of attacking about 200 lawyers as they marched to Sindh High Court, where Chaudhry was due to make an address. Naeem Quereshi, a spokesman for the Karachi Bar Association, said dozens of lawyers were injured in attacks by MQM activists across the city. Earlier, Pakistan's interior minister, Aftab Khan Sherpao, had offered assurances that no one would be allowed to "disrupt peace" in Karachi, Pakistan's commercial hub &#151; although opposition parties accused the government of condoning the unrest. "The government is providing all facilities to the MQM for its rally, and we are being harassed, attacked and humiliated," said Marajul Huda, Karachi chief of Jamaat-e-Islami. In the 1990s, scores of MQM activists were arrested for allegedly kidnapping dozens of their rivals and attacking security forces. Party activists are still heavily armed, but critics say they enjoy impunity as part of Musharraf's government.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070511/lf_afp/lifestyleskoreaasia	International marriages -- and divorces -- surge in SKorea - Yahoo! News International marriages -- and divorces -- surge in SKorea Fri May 11, 10:39 AM ET OSAN, South Korea (AFP) - Despite the unromantic occasion, Ngo Ngoc Quy Hong says it was love at first sight when she and other Vietnamese women held a group meeting with prospective husbands from "I don&#39;t know why but at that moment, I knew I had just found my man," said Hong, 21, beaming at her husband who is 19 years older than her. "Age does not matter. I am very happy now," she said in halting Korean, her gold bracelet glinting as she flipped through an album of their wedding photos taken in Ho Chi Minh City. Her husband Kim Choong-Hwan, a 40-year-old truck driver, has only one regret. "I regret I had no chance to meet a Vietnamese woman earlier. If I had, I would have married a Vietnamese," said Kim, who divorced his first wife, a South Korean, in 2002. "Hong is six months&#39; pregnant. I know it&#39;s a son," he told AFP proudly during an interview at their modest apartment in Osan, 55 km (34 miles) south of Seoul. Kim is among a growing army of South Korean bachelors or divorcees who have turned to China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Mongolia, Thailand, Russia, Uzbekistan and other foreign countries for brides. In a country long known for its homogeneous make-up, government statistics show that the number of marriages to foreigners jumped 21.6 percent to 43,121 in 2005 -- 13.6 percent of all newlyweds. Experts say many farmers who fail to persuade local women to accept a rural lifestyle, and surplus bachelors resulting from the traditional preference for sons over daughters, turn to foreign brides. The National Statistical Office said 72 percent of international marriages involved Korean men and foreign women. Chinese brides topped the list at 66.2 percent, followed by Vietnamese with 18.7 percent, Japanese with four percent and Filipinas with 3.2 percent. But Vietnamese brides are becoming increasingly popular. The number of such weddings jumped by 136.5 percent to 5,822 in 2005 compared to a mere 95 in 2000. "Vietnamese women are quite popular here as they are considered the most tolerant to Korea&#39;s Confucianist, family-oriented culture and they adapt well here," said Lee Eun-Tae, president of Interwedding Co. Hong said she had been a fan of Korean TV dramas aired in Vietnam, part of a wave of Korean pop culture spreading across Asia. Her twin sister married a Korean three months before her. Another sister has also tied the knot with a Korean who travelled to Vietnam alongside Kim to find a bride. Kim said he had chanced on a street sign reading: "Why don&#39;t you marry a beautiful Vietnamese?" He visited a marriage agency in Seoul after he became frustrated with what he called materialistic local women. "Their first questions are only concerned with your social status, occupation, income and the like. They don&#39;t care about character," he said. Kim spent 10,000 dollars for a five-day package tour to Vietnam which included a wedding ceremony and a one-night honeymoon. Decisions on brides are made within a matter of hours through a group get-together. Out of a line-up of 40 girls, Kim and five others made three picks each. The brides and their families have the final say on who should be the lucky ones. They may reject all the men on offer. Most such marriages are arranged by commercial agencies like Interwedding. "Then, you may ask where is romance? But love is something that can come instantly and all the men and women taking part in this programme are prepared to get married very soon," Lee said. But couples like Hong and Kim can be the lucky ones. Lee said some of his competitors failed to do their homework, screening bridegrooms and brides cursorily and introducing couples unfit to marry. A government survey showed one out of every five migrant women found their Korean husbands different from the description they received from the agencies. Activists say some foreign brides end up living with spouses who have few assets or are ill, alcoholic or of difficult character. A 2005 study by the Ministry of Health and Welfare showed that 14 percent of 945 migrant wives surveyed said they had been beaten by their Korean husbands. "Some Korean husbands, unable to get through to their foreign wives because of language barriers, get angry and beat them. They also tend to think they have purchased their wives," said Kwon Mi-Ju of the Women Migrants Human Rights Centre. Activists say foreign brides often face serious problems adapting to a new life in a country with a different culture and atmosphere. As a result, divorces between Korean men and foreign wives are rising fast, reaching 2,400 in 2005 -- up 65 percent from the previous year. "Lured by the country&#39;s economic strength, many foreign women come here harboring illusions about Korea," said Yoo Kyung-Sun, an aide to lawmaker Kim Choon-Jin. Kim has proposed a law bill to curb reckless matchmaking by commercial agencies.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_go_ot/postal_rates	Stamp prices to go up Monday - Yahoo! News Stamp prices to go up Monday By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 2:49 PM ET WASHINGTON - It will cost a bit more to mail letters and parcels starting Monday. A first-class letter will go up 2 cents to 41 cents. But there is also some good news &#151; folks will be able to buy "forever" stamps that remain valid regardless of any future increase. While the new rates take effect Monday, most post offices are closed on Sunday so officials say items dropped in a box that won't be collected until Monday should have the higher postage on them. On the other hand, when rates change the agency usually allows a little leeway, and it doesn't plan a rash of returns for insufficient postage. Postmaster General John Potter has said that even with the higher prices the agency expects a deficit this year as it struggles to compete in a swiftly changing communications market. For most people, the first-class rate has the greatest impact, covering cards and letters. While the first-class rate will rise from 39 cents to 41 cents for the first ounce, people sending heavier letters &#151; such as wedding invitations &#151; will see a reduction in the price. That's because each additional ounce will cost just 17 cents, down from the current 24 cents. That means a two-ounce letter will cost 58 cents to mail, compared with 63 cents now. Also expected to be attractive to many people is the forever stamp. The first forever stamps are selling for 41 cents apiece, but they won't have a price printed on them and they will remain valid for sending a letter regardless of any future increases. While a forever stamp will always be valid for mailing a latter, that doesn't mean the price won't go up. If rates were to increase to 45 cents, for example, that's what a forever stamp would sell for. But stamps already purchased at a lower cost could still be used without adding extra postage. International rates are also going up. Letters to Canada and Mexico will rise to 69 cents and to most other countries to 90 cents. Other international services are being redesigned to more closely resemble domestic rates, and the charges will vary by country. Prices based on size and shape are also included in the new domestic rates. For example, while a first-class regular envelope is 41 cents for the first ounce, the charge will be 90 cents for the first ounce of a large envelope and $1.13 for the first ounce of a first-class parcel.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_go_ot/postal_rates	Stamp prices to go up Monday - Yahoo! News Stamp prices to go up Monday By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 2:49 PM ET WASHINGTON - It will cost a bit more to mail letters and parcels starting Monday. A first-class letter will go up 2 cents to 41 cents. But there is also some good news &#151; folks will be able to buy "forever" stamps that remain valid regardless of any future increase. While the new rates take effect Monday, most post offices are closed on Sunday so officials say items dropped in a box that won't be collected until Monday should have the higher postage on them. On the other hand, when rates change the agency usually allows a little leeway, and it doesn't plan a rash of returns for insufficient postage. Postmaster General John Potter has said that even with the higher prices the agency expects a deficit this year as it struggles to compete in a swiftly changing communications market. For most people, the first-class rate has the greatest impact, covering cards and letters. While the first-class rate will rise from 39 cents to 41 cents for the first ounce, people sending heavier letters &#151; such as wedding invitations &#151; will see a reduction in the price. That's because each additional ounce will cost just 17 cents, down from the current 24 cents. That means a two-ounce letter will cost 58 cents to mail, compared with 63 cents now. Also expected to be attractive to many people is the forever stamp. The first forever stamps are selling for 41 cents apiece, but they won't have a price printed on them and they will remain valid for sending a letter regardless of any future increases. While a forever stamp will always be valid for mailing a latter, that doesn't mean the price won't go up. If rates were to increase to 45 cents, for example, that's what a forever stamp would sell for. But stamps already purchased at a lower cost could still be used without adding extra postage. International rates are also going up. Letters to Canada and Mexico will rise to 69 cents and to most other countries to 90 cents. Other international services are being redesigned to more closely resemble domestic rates, and the charges will vary by country. Prices based on size and shape are also included in the new domestic rates. For example, while a first-class regular envelope is 41 cents for the first ounce, the charge will be 90 cents for the first ounce of a large envelope and $1.13 for the first ounce of a first-class parcel. For all three each additional ounce is 17 cents. When the new prices go into effect the fundraising stamp for Breast Cancer will increase to 55 cents. It is valid for first-class postage with the excess charge used to support research into breast cancer. Postage rates last went up in January 2006.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_he_me/mandatory_hiv_testing	N.J. plan would mandate HIV tests - Yahoo! News N.J. plan would mandate HIV tests By TOM HESTER Jr., Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 5:46 PM ET TRENTON, N.J. - New Jersey would become the first state to require both pregnant women and newborns to be tested for under a proposal introduced by the Senate president. The bill would require all pregnant women be tested for HIV twice, once early in the pregnancy and a second time in the third trimester. Every birthing facility in the state would have to test all newborns in their care. Senate President Richard J. Codey introduced the legislation on Thursday, which he described as a "no brainer." The Associated Press first reported on Codey's plan in March. "The key in the fight against HIV and is early detection and treatment," Codey said Friday. "For newborns this can be a lifesaving measure." Codey, D-Essex, said the bill stems from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that found medical treatment during pregnancy can dramatically cut mother-to-child HIV transmission. The Center for Women Policy Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based feminist advocacy organization, opposes mandatory HIV testing, arguing it violates a woman's right to make their own childbearing and medical treatment decisions. Current New Jersey law requires providers only to offer HIV testing to pregnant women. Under Codey's proposal, the test would be given unless the mother chooses, in writing, not to have it. According to the Kaiser Foundation, a nonprofit research organization focusing on U.S. health care issues, four states &#151; Arkansas, Michigan, Tennessee and Texas &#151; require health care providers to test a mother for HIV, unless the mother specifically asks not to be tested. Connecticut and New York are the only states that test all newborns for HIV, according to the foundation. New Jersey has some of the highest rates in the nation for AIDS cases, women with AIDS and pediatric HIV and AIDS cases, according to the foundation. Codey's bill will be scheduled for hearings in the coming weeks. To become law, it must be approved by both the state Senate and Assembly, and then signed by the governor.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070512/ap_on_el_pr/romney_wealth	Romney's estimated wealth in millions - Yahoo! News Romney's estimated wealth in millions By JIM KUHNHENN, Associated Press Writer Sat May 12, 3:28 AM ET WASHINGTON - Republican Mitt Romney is expected to report financial assets between $190 million and $250 million, an amount that would likely make him the wealthiest of the 2008 presidential candidates. Aides to the former Massachusetts governor said his assets have been held in a blind trust that he and his wife set up when he took office in 2002. The adviser who provided the estimate of his assets cautioned that the number is based on 2005 and 2006 financial activity and could amount to a bigger total once the disclosure report is filed later this year. The adviser spoke on condition of anonymity because the totals have not been officially released. The deadline for filing financial disclosures is Tuesday but Romney on Friday obtained an extension. Romney lent his campaign $2 million this year and could clearly tap his wealth again if necessary. Romney is not the wealthiest candidate ever to run for president. , who ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination in 1996, had an estimate net worth of more than $430 million. , the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, reported a net worth between $165 million and $235 million in 2005, most of it controlled by his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry. Under federal law, officials who are required to divulge their finances must only list their assets and income in broad ranges, making it impossible to pinpoint their exact wealth. Romney also has a blind trust for his children and grandchildren that is estimated to hold assets between $70 million and $100 million, the adviser said. Those assets do not benefit Romney or his wife and are not required to be reported in federal financial disclosures. Romney has five sons, five daughters-in-law and 10 grandchildren. In 1984, Romney founded Bain Capital, an investment company that helped finance Staples, Domino's Pizza and Brookstone. He then became interim CEO at Bain and Co., the consulting firm where he had worked in the early 1980s. He was credited with pulling Bain and Co., out of financial straits. Romney, 60, also was CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 In the 2008 race, Romney surprised the Republican field by raising more than $20 million for his campaign in the first three months of the year, outpacing GOP front-runners Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, and Arizona Sen. John McCain ( The estimated total is the first glimpse of Romney's wealth since he has been a public official. Aides said his holdings are complicated, spread across partnerships, investment funds and hedge funds. One adviser said obtaining the underlying assets of the hedge fund alone is "a pretty arduous task." Romney received permission Friday from the to delay the official filing of his financial disclosure documents for 45 days beyond Tuesday's deadline. Candidates are entitled to obtain two extensions of up to 45 days each. Most presidential candidates have yet to file their reports. Romney communications director Matt Rhoades said the trustee for Romney's blind trust and "advisers are working diligently to complete the voluminous and complex process and we'll comply with the law." Romney's top rivals, Rudy Giuliani and John McCain, also are wealthy men. McCain, an Arizona senator, amassed most of his money through investments and holdings controlled by his wife, Cindy, an heiress to a major beer distributor, Hensley & Co., founded by her father. Estimates put their net worth at between $20-$32 million. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, earned his fortune from a multitude of business consulting ventures and paid speeches after leaving office. He received $11.4 million in speaking fees in 2006 alone, an average of about $88,000 a speech. , a former trial lawyer, listed his net worth at between $12.8 million and $60 million in 2003, his last report. , in a 2005 Senate financial disclosure, listed her net worth at between $10 million and $50 million.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_eu/britain_aboriginal_remains	Britain to hand over Aboriginal remains - Yahoo! News Britain to hand over Aboriginal remains By RAPHAEL G. SATTER, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 9:09 PM ET LONDON - London's Natural History Museum struck a deal to hand over a set of 17 Tasmanian Aborigine remains to a native rights' group, the museum said Thursday. The 19th century remains &#151; including teeth, skulls and skeletons looted from Tasmania &#151; will be turned over to a delegation from the Tasmanian Aboriginal Center in a private ceremony at the museum on Friday, the museum said in a statement. The delegates will accompany the remains on a flight back to Tasmania &#151; an Australian island about 125 miles south of the mainland &#151; the following day. Museum officials have said the Tasmanian specimens are of particular scientific value because they date back to when Tasmania was an isolated part of the world and its people were genetically unique. The decision means the museum will no longer be able to extract genetic material from the bones or perform isotope analysis, something Richard Lane, the Museum's director of science, said might have yielded insight into the Aborigines' genetic makeup, their diet and possibly even their culture. Although the museum agreed to return the remains to Australia last year, it had maintained the right to continue testing them &#151; taking photographs, running the bones through CT scans and shaving off small bits of bone from the teeth and skulls. The Tasmanian Aboriginal Center sued to stop the testing, saying it defiled the remains. Aborigines believe that the deceased cannot freely enter the "dreaming" &#151; or spirit &#151; world until their remains are returned to their homeland, and tampering with human remains is believed to cause irreversible spiritual harm. Under the agreement, all of the bones will be returned. However, some of the genetic material previously extracted from them will be held at a neutral facility in Tasmania under the joint control of both the center and the museum, leaving open the possibility that it might be used for experiments later.

News Britain to hand over Aboriginal remains By RAPHAEL G. SATTER, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 9:09 PM ET LONDON - London's Natural History Museum struck a deal to hand over a set of 17 Tasmanian Aborigine remains to a native rights' group, the museum said Thursday. The 19th century remains &#151; including teeth, skulls and skeletons looted from Tasmania &#151; will be turned over to a delegation from the Tasmanian Aboriginal Center in a private ceremony at the museum on Friday, the museum said in a statement. The delegates will accompany the remains on a flight back to Tasmania &#151; an Australian island about 125 miles south of the mainland &#151; the following day. Museum officials have said the Tasmanian specimens are of particular scientific value because they date back to when Tasmania was an isolated part of the world and its people were genetically unique. The decision means the museum will no longer be able to extract genetic material from the bones or perform isotope analysis, something Richard Lane, the Museum's director of science, said might have yielded insight into the Aborigines' genetic makeup, their diet and possibly even their culture. Although the museum agreed to return the remains to Australia last year, it had maintained the right to continue testing them &#151; taking photographs, running the bones through CT scans and shaving off small bits of bone from the teeth and skulls. The Tasmanian Aboriginal Center sued to stop the testing, saying it defiled the remains. Aborigines believe that the deceased cannot freely enter the "dreaming" &#151; or spirit &#151; world until their remains are returned to their homeland, and tampering with human remains is believed to cause irreversible spiritual harm. Under the agreement, all of the bones will be returned. However, some of the genetic material previously extracted from them will be held at a neutral facility in Tasmania under the joint control of both the center and the museum, leaving open the possibility that it might be used for experiments later. The bones were originally dug up or stolen by the white settlers who would eventually displace the island's native population. The museum said the bones &#151; most of which found their way into its collection during the 1940s &#151; were obtained legally through donations and transfers from other institutions. The Australian ambassador wrote to Britain's government in February urging it to have the matter settled out of court, and the museum agreed to mediation two weeks later.

News Imus producer: Sharpton a 'race-baiter' 2 hours, 15 minutes ago NEW YORK - Don Imus' former producer on Friday called Rev. a "race-baiter" who was looking for attention when he led a campaign to fire the radio host, while Sharpton said Imus and his producer got what they deserved for making a racist, sexist remark on the air. Bernard McGuirk and Sharpton appeared together for a combative debate on Fox News Channel's "Hannity & Colmes" show. The producer was fired last month for his part in an exchange on the "Imus in the Morning" program in which the members of the Rutgers University women's basketball team were called "nappy-headed hos." MSNBC took Imus' show off the air on April 11 and CBS fired him from his syndicated radio program a day later for the slur. McGuirk, a 20-year producer and on-air jester for the show that originated on WFAN-AM in New York, called the team "hardcore hos" in the April 4 exchange with Imus. Sharpton held protests and lobbied both networks to fire Imus. McGuirk called Sharpton a "crude ... opportunist, a race-baiter" who campaigned against Imus to help his own career and raise his profile. While McGuirk acknowledged that "these words did hurt these girls," he added, "until you, Reverend Al, got involved, they probably never would have heard of it. They would have probably never, quote unquote, got scarred for life until you got involved for your own self-serving interests." Sharpton said he wasn't looking for more attention &#151; "if you have any recollection at all, I had been in the papers all year," he said. He said Imus and McGuirk may have apologized for the remark, but "forgiveness is not the point. The question is the penalty." "Consumers have the right to say to advertisers, are your standards going to be where people are attacked based on your gender and race?" Sharpton said. McGuirk countered that Sharpton "terrorized these spineless, thumbsucking executives" into taking Imus off the air. In an earlier appearance on "Hannity & Colmes," he said the executives "were in a fetal position under their desks sucking their thumbs on their BlackBerrys, trying to coordinate their response." Sharpton responded: "What he is saying is we want to apologize and we want to decide what the penalty is." He said that most people wanted Imus fired, including a minister who arranged Imus' meeting with the Rutgers team, and many NBC employees. "Is Al Roker one of these guys hiding under the desk with a BlackBerry?" Sharpton asked. McGuirk said that Imus "made one small mistake. He ran a red light" and shouldn't have been fired. He asked Sharpton. "Who elected you the PC police chief? Who elected you to anything?" Imus has not spoken publicly since his dismissal, but his lawyer has said he intends to sue CBS for $120 million, and said that the network encouraged irreverent, off-color comments on the program.

McGuirk called Sharpton a "crude ... opportunist, a race-baiter" who campaigned against Imus to help his own career and raise his profile. While McGuirk acknowledged that "these words did hurt these girls," he added, "until you, Reverend Al, got involved, they probably never would have heard of it. They would have probably never, quote unquote, got scarred for life until you got involved for your own self-serving interests." Sharpton said he wasn't looking for more attention &#151; "if you have any recollection at all, I had been in the papers all year," he said. He said Imus and McGuirk may have apologized for the remark, but "forgiveness is not the point. The question is the penalty." "Consumers have the right to say to advertisers, are your standards going to be where people are attacked based on your gender and race?" Sharpton said. McGuirk countered that Sharpton "terrorized these spineless, thumbsucking executives" into taking Imus off the air. In an earlier appearance on "Hannity & Colmes," he said the executives "were in a fetal position under their desks sucking their thumbs on their BlackBerrys, trying to coordinate their response." Sharpton responded: "What he is saying is we want to apologize and we want to decide what the penalty is." He said that most people wanted Imus fired, including a minister who arranged Imus' meeting with the Rutgers team, and many NBC employees. "Is Al Roker one of these guys hiding under the desk with a BlackBerry?" Sharpton asked. McGuirk said that Imus "made one small mistake. He ran a red light" and shouldn't have been fired. He asked Sharpton. "Who elected you the PC police chief? Who elected you to anything?" Imus has not spoken publicly since his dismissal, but his lawyer has said he intends to sue CBS for $120 million, and said that the network encouraged irreverent, off-color comments on the program.

News Somalis settle in old mill city in Maine By JERRY HARKAVY, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 1:58 PM ET LEWISTON, Maine - A prank in which a middle-schooler tossed a slab of leftover Easter ham onto a table surrounded by Somalian Muslim youngsters has exposed &#151; yet again &#151; the gaping cultural divide in this struggling former mill town. Over the past six years, as many as 3,500 black refugees from the war-torn African country have settled in this nearly all-white, heavily French-Canadian and largely Roman Catholic city of 36,000, giving Lewiston the highest concentration of Somalis anywhere in America. Along Lisbon Street, the main downtown thoroughfare, the latest newcomers to a city built by waves of immigrants have created a mosque, the Red Sea restaurant and a couple of halal grocery stores as they try to adapt to their strange new world. Women in colorful head scarves or ankle-length hijabs can be seen walking together, not far from the canals, the once-bustling mills and the twin spires of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, built with millhands' dollars. But the influx of Somalis has raised tensions. In 2002, then-Mayor Larry Raymond created a furor when he issued a letter asking Lewiston's Somalis, then numbering about 1,000, to advise their countrymen not to come here because the city's resources were "maxed out." Tensions ran high again last summer when a local man rolled a pig's head into a Somali mosque during evening prayers. (Pork is considered unclean by Muslims.) The perpetrator, who said he did it as a joke, was charged with desecrating a place of worship. He committed suicide after a recent standoff with police. Then on April 11 came the ham incident. The student was suspended and the Maine attorney general looked into whether the prank represented a hate crime. Ultimately, no charges were filed. Haaruan Sheekhey, a 27-year-old Somali who moved to Lewiston from Denver two years ago, said he is ready to try his luck elsewhere. His restaurant failed after it was hit by vandals who scratched a swastika on a window, he said, and employers are reluctant to hire Somalis. "If somebody says, `I'm happy in Lewiston,' they're lying," he said. "We're having a hard time in this city. We're struggling. We're trying so hard to be part of this community, trying so hard to find a job, but nobody gives us a chance." Others, however, say that the Somalis are assimilating well and that a few incidents don't reflect the way the newcomers have been accepted. "Yes, there is some friction every once in a while, but that often gets blown out of proportion," said Pierrot Rugaba, program director for refugee and immigration services of Catholic Charities Maine. "Things have improved, but like everything else it takes time." Many Somalis have moved into the city's housing projects, while others are clustered in the downtown area in aging three- and four-story tenements formerly occupied by French-Canadian immigrants who worked at the textile mills in the city's industrial heyday in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By most accounts, language problems and a lack of job opportunities have proven to be the biggest hurdle to Lewiston's Somalis as they try to move up the economic ladder, leading many to shift their hopes and dreams to the next generation. "Their children are the only assets they have. They left everything else in Somalia," said Said Mohamud, manager of the Mogadishu Store, a grocery. Mohamud, 46, who taught chemistry at a university in the Somalian capital, has a daughter studying at Smith College who plans to go on to medical school and another child studying accounting at Barry University in Florida. His six other children also plan to go to college, he said. The Somalis began arriving in this city in the dead of winter in February 2001, beginning the ethnic transformation of a city that was 97 percent white. Lewiston's Somalis now represent close to 10 percent of the population, with an additional 30 or so arriving each month. Because of the Somalis' large families, the percentage in the schools is even higher. Lewiston's emergence as the city with the nation's largest percentage of Somalis happened largely by chance. Many had been placed in the Atlanta area, where it was assumed a warm climate and a large black population would ease their adjustment to America. But dismay at high crime, drugs and gangs prompted the community to look elsewhere, Mohamud said. The word went out that Maine was a safe place to raise a family. Immigrants had resettled in Portland, 40 miles to the south, but there was a shortage of affordable apartments there. Lewiston had more vacancies because of its population losses. "Lewiston is a small town, with no experiences of having immigrants from Africa, so it was a strange marriage," said Omar Jamal, executive director of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in St. Paul, Minn. Minneapolis has the highest number of Somalis, some 20,000, he said, but Lewiston has the highest concentration. Jimmy Simones, owner of a restaurant near City Hall and grandson of Greek immigrants, said incidents like the pig's head and the ham should not overshadow the way the city has welcomed its latest arrivals from abroad. Overall, he said, the Somalis are winning acceptance. "All newcomers run into these bumps in the road. This is nothing different," he said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_he_me/thin_fat_people	DIET: Thin people may be fat inside - Yahoo! News DIET: Thin people may be fat inside By MARIA CHENG, AP Medical Writer Fri May 11, 5:37 PM ET LONDON - If it really is what's on the inside that counts, then a lot of thin people might be in trouble. Some doctors now think that the internal fat surrounding vital organs like the heart, liver or pancreas &#151; invisible to the naked eye &#151; could be as dangerous as the more obvious external fat that bulges underneath the skin. "Being thin doesn't automatically mean you're not fat," said Dr. Jimmy Bell, a professor of molecular imaging at Imperial College, London. Since 1994, Bell and his team have scanned nearly 800 people with MRI machines to create "fat maps" showing where people store fat. According to the data, people who maintain their weight through diet rather than exercise are likely to have major deposits of internal fat, even if they are otherwise slim. "The whole concept of being fat needs to be redefined," said Bell, whose research is funded by Britain's Medical Research Council. Without a clear warning signal &#151; like a rounder middle &#151; doctors worry that thin people may be lulled into falsely assuming that because they're not overweight, they're healthy. "Just because someone is lean doesn't make them immune to diabetes or other risk factors for heart disease," said Dr. Louis Teichholz, chief of cardiology at Hackensack Hospital in New Jersey, who was not involved in Bell's research. Even people with normal Body Mass Index scores &#151; a standard obesity measure that divides your weight by the square of your height &#151; can have surprising levels of fat deposits inside. Of the women scanned by Bell and his colleagues, as many as 45 percent of those with normal BMI scores (20 to 25) actually had excessive levels of internal fat. Among men, the percentage was nearly 60 percent. Relating the news to what Bell calls "TOFIs" &#151; people who are "thin outside, fat inside" &#151; is rarely uneventful. "The thinner people are, the bigger the surprise," he said, adding the researchers even found TOFIs among people who are professional models. According to Bell, people who are fat on the inside are essentially on the threshold of being obese. They eat too many fatty, sugary foods &#151; and exercise too little to work it off &#151; but they are not eating enough to actually be fat. Scientists believe we naturally accumulate fat around the belly first, but at some point, the body may start storing it elsewhere. Still, most experts believe that being of normal weight is an indicator of good health, and that BMI is a reliable measurement. "BMI won't give you the exact indication of where fat is, but it's a useful clinical tool," said Dr. Toni Steer, a nutritionist at Britain's Medical Research Council. Doctors are unsure about the exact dangers of internal fat, but some suspect it contributes to the risk of heart disease and diabetes. They theorize that internal fat disrupts the body's communication systems. The fat enveloping internal organs might be sending the body mistaken chemical signals to store fat inside organs like the liver or pancreas. This could ultimately lead to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, or heart disease. Experts have long known that fat, active people can be healthier than their skinny, inactive counterparts. "Normal-weight persons who are sedentary and unfit are at much higher risk for mortality than obese persons who are active and fit," said Dr. Steven Blair, an obesity expert at the University of South Carolina. For example, despite their ripples of fat, super-sized Sumo wrestlers probably have a better metabolic profile than some of their slim, sedentary spectators, Bell said. That's because the wrestlers' fat is primarily stored under the skin, not streaking throughout their vital organs and muscles. The good news is that internal fat can be easily burned off through exercise or even by improving your diet. "Even if you don't see it on your bathroom scale, caloric restriction and physical exercise have an aggressive effect on visceral fat," said Dr. Bob Ross, an obesity expert at Queen's University in Canada. Because many factors contribute to heart disease, Teichholz says it's difficult to determine the precise danger of internal fat &#151; though it certainly doesn't help. "Obesity is a risk factor, but it's lower down on the totem pole of risk factors," he said, explaining that whether or not people smoke, their family histories and blood pressure and cholesterol rates are more important determinants than both external and internal fat. When it comes to being fit, experts say there is no short-cut. "If you just want to look thin, then maybe dieting is enough," Bell said. "But if you want to actually be healthy, then exercise has to be an important component of your lifestyle."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_en_tv/tv_new_season	ABC network adds 11 new series - Yahoo! News ABC network adds 11 new series By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer 2 hours, 21 minutes ago NEW YORK - ABC scheduled its "Grey's Anatomy" spinoff for Wednesdays and committed to a comedy derived from the Geico "Cavemen" commercials as part of an ambitious schedule with eight new series for the fall and 11 overall. The third-place network lost an average of a million viewers in prime-time from last season, many attributable to the end of "Monday Night Football." With bankable hits "Grey's Anatomy," "Desperate Housewives" and "Dancing With the Stars" returning, ABC is giving viewers plenty of new choices in the fall. That approach contrasts with fourth-place NBC, which is introducing half as many new series under the theory that it's tough to market so many new shows. The most anticipated new ABC series is "Private Practice," which takes Dr. Addison Shepard (Kate Walsh) from Seattle and moves her to Los Angeles. A special "Grey's Anatomy" that served as the show's pilot was seen by 21 million people earlier this month. The new series will air Wednesdays at 9 p.m., part of a night with all-new programming. Despite the high hopes, ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson indicated Tuesday that creator Shonda Rhimes has work ahead of her. In the pilot, he said, "we spent a lot of time introducing the characters and not enough time introducing the stories." "Cavemen" takes the commercial characters and sets them up in Atlanta, trying to live like normal guys in their 30s. The series pokes fun at the normally serious topic of racial attitudes, but since they're cavemen "it gives you kind of the ability to offend everybody but offend no one," McPherson said. The pilot has already gotten some poor word-of-mouth, but McPherson urged caution. Out of 17 drama pilots ABC tested before audiences last season, eventual hit "Ugly Betty" did worse than all but one, he said. After serial dramas on dark topics failed last season, ABC leaned more toward series that don't need an intense commitment to follow. Lighter, fantasy-oriented topics are also evident, with series on a lawyer with visions, a man who can bring dead people to life and ambitious executives. "People didn't show up for these shows (last year)," McPherson said. "It wasn't a matter of seeing a show and rejecting it. People didn't show up. So we listened to that." The network canceled the comedies " ," "Help Me Help You" and "Knights of Prosperity." "What About Brian" did not make the cut, and ABC is still debating the future of "According to Jim," while leaving it off the fall schedule. The cancellation angered Lopez, who complained in the Los Angeles Times that his comedy about a Latino family is being dumped in favor of cavemen. "TV just became really, really white again," Lopez said. The first prime-time series from 's Harpo Productions, "Oprah's Big Give," will debut in midseason. It's a reality series where contestants compete in philanthropy. In contrast to last year, when "Grey's Anatomy" made its successful switch to Thursday nights, ABC plans no major shifts of its existing series. "Men in Trees" moves to an earlier time slot on Friday nights. "Lost" will return in midseason, but ABC made no time slot commitment. Other new series that ABC plans for next season: _"Pushing Daisies," a "forensic fairy tale" about a young man who can bring dead people to life with his touch. He does that for his childhood sweetheart, only to learn that if he touches her again, she's dead for good. _"Dirty Sexy Money," a trashy prime-time soap about the venal Darling family of New York. Family members include , William Baldwin and Jill Clayburgh. _"Big Shots," a drama about four hard-charging friends and CEOs who are less successful with women. play the lead characters. _"Cashmere Mafia," ABC's attempt to inherit the "Sex and the City" mantle. Four women, friends since business school, juggle their personal and professional lives in New York. NBC has a similar new show with three women. ABC's show has _"Sam I Am," a comedy with about a woman who awakes from a coma with no memory, only to find out she was a creep before. _"Eli Stone," a drama about a top lawyer in San Francisco who begins having visions because of a brain aneurysm, only to find his firm has a bunch of creeps. _"Women's Murder Club," a drama, is also set in San Francisco. Based on James Patterson novels, it's about four crime-fighting women &#151; a detective, district attorney, medical examiner and reporter. _"Carpoolers," a comedy about four men from different backgrounds who get together each day for some male bonding on the drive to work. _"Miss/Guided," a comedy about a former high school geek who returns to her alma mater as a guidance counselor, only to see an ex-cheerleader and former nemesis come back as an English teacher.

That approach contrasts with fourth-place NBC, which is introducing half as many new series under the theory that it's tough to market so many new shows. The most anticipated new ABC series is "Private Practice," which takes Dr. Addison Shepard (Kate Walsh) from Seattle and moves her to Los Angeles. A special "Grey's Anatomy" that served as the show's pilot was seen by 21 million people earlier this month. The new series will air Wednesdays at 9 p.m., part of a night with all-new programming. Despite the high hopes, ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson indicated Tuesday that creator Shonda Rhimes has work ahead of her. In the pilot, he said, "we spent a lot of time introducing the characters and not enough time introducing the stories." "Cavemen" takes the commercial characters and sets them up in Atlanta, trying to live like normal guys in their 30s. The series pokes fun at the normally serious topic of racial attitudes, but since they're cavemen "it gives you kind of the ability to offend everybody but offend no one," McPherson said. The pilot has already gotten some poor word-of-mouth, but McPherson urged caution. Out of 17 drama pilots ABC tested before audiences last season, eventual hit "Ugly Betty" did worse than all but one, he said. After serial dramas on dark topics failed last season, ABC leaned more toward series that don't need an intense commitment to follow. Lighter, fantasy-oriented topics are also evident, with series on a lawyer with visions, a man who can bring dead people to life and ambitious executives. "People didn't show up for these shows (last year)," McPherson said. "It wasn't a matter of seeing a show and rejecting it. People didn't show up. So we listened to that." The network canceled the comedies " ," "Help Me Help You" and "Knights of Prosperity." "What About Brian" did not make the cut, and ABC is still debating the future of "According to Jim," while leaving it off the fall schedule. The cancellation angered Lopez, who complained in the Los Angeles Times that his comedy about a Latino family is being dumped in favor of cavemen. "TV just became really, really white again," Lopez said. The first prime-time series from 's Harpo Productions, "Oprah's Big Give," will debut in midseason. It's a reality series where contestants compete in philanthropy. In contrast to last year, when "Grey's Anatomy" made its successful switch to Thursday nights, ABC plans no major shifts of its existing series. "Men in Trees" moves to an earlier time slot on Friday nights. "Lost" will return in midseason, but ABC made no time slot commitment. Other new series that ABC plans for next season: _"Pushing Daisies," a "forensic fairy tale" about a young man who can bring dead people to life with his touch. He does that for his childhood sweetheart, only to learn that if he touches her again, she's dead for good. _"Dirty Sexy Money," a trashy prime-time soap about the venal Darling family of New York. Family members include , William Baldwin and Jill Clayburgh. _"Big Shots," a drama about four hard-charging friends and CEOs who are less successful with women. play the lead characters. _"Cashmere Mafia," ABC's attempt to inherit the "Sex and the City" mantle. Four women, friends since business school, juggle their personal and professional lives in New York. NBC has a similar new show with three women. ABC's show has _"Sam I Am," a comedy with about a woman who awakes from a coma with no memory, only to find out she was a creep before. _"Eli Stone," a drama about a top lawyer in San Francisco who begins having visions because of a brain aneurysm, only to find his firm has a bunch of creeps. _"Women's Murder Club," a drama, is also set in San Francisco. Based on James Patterson novels, it's about four crime-fighting women &#151; a detective, district attorney, medical examiner and reporter. _"Carpoolers," a comedy about four men from different backgrounds who get together each day for some male bonding on the drive to work. _"Miss/Guided," a comedy about a former high school geek who returns to her alma mater as a guidance counselor, only to see an ex-cheerleader and former nemesis come back as an English teacher.

News Wis. festival sells deep-fried testicles Sun May 13, 2:56 PM ET ELDERON, Wis. - Around here, it may be tough to pass up anything deep-fried. Wisconsinites have deep-fried cheese curds, candy bars and Twinkies. They now have deep-fried livestock testicles, too. More than 300 people paid $5 for all-you-can-eat goat, lamb and bull testicles Saturday at the ninth annual Testicle Festival at Mama's Place Bar and Grill in Elderon in central Wisconsin. "Once you get over the mental (aspect) of what you're eating, it's just like eating any other food, and it tastes good," Buster Hoffman said. Festival founder Nancy Fenske said the festival grew out of her late husband Roger's birthday party 12 years ago. They decided to have "a nut fry" at Mama's Place after bringing back lamb fries from a trip to Montana. The event grew every year and now they fry up to 100 pounds of testicles, she said. "What else can you do in a small town?" Fenske said. Butch Joubert, 58, likes the parts sandwiched between bread with tartar sauce. They're not so different from regular meatballs also served at the festival, he said. "After a few beers, you can't really tell the difference," Joubert said.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_eu/netherlands_nazi_archive	Diplomats agree to transfer Nazi archive - Yahoo! News Diplomats agree to transfer Nazi archive By ARTHUR MAX, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 10:53 AM ET AMSTERDAM, Netherlands - Diplomats from 11 countries agreed Tuesday to bypass legal obstacles and begin distributing electronic copies of documents from a secretive Nazi archive, making them available to Holocaust researchers for the first time in more than a half century. The decision was meant to avoid further delays in allowing Holocaust survivors to find their own stories and family histories, and for historians to seek new insights into Europe's darkest period. The countries governing the archive maintained by the International Tracing Service approved a plan to begin transferring scanned documents as soon as they are ready so that receiving institutions can begin preparing them for public use, said a delegate, requesting anonymity because a formal announcement was due later Tuesday. The decision circumvents the requirement to withhold the documents until all 11 countries ratify the 2006 treaty amendments that enabled the unsealing of the documents. Ratification is still pending in four countries, and Tuesday's vote was likely to shave several months from the distribution timetable. Until now, the files maintained in the central German town of Bad Arolsen have been used to track missing people, reunite families, and later to validate restitution claims. The Tracing Service is an arm of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Three countries, the United States, France and Germany, pledged to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to offset costs for preparing and transmitting the papers, said the delegate. But some U.S. survivors expressed dismay that the documents will remain restricted to a single place &#151; the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington &#151; and that they won't have unfettered access. "I'm anxious, because 105 people from my immediate family did not make it. I am the only survivor," said David Schaecter, of Miami, Fla. "How do I obtain what I am rightfully entitled to obtain &#151; (to know) what happened to these 105 people," he said. The archive contains Nazi records on the arrest, transportation, incarceration, forced labor and deaths of millions of people from the year the Nazis built their first concentration camp in 1933 to the end of the war. It also has a vast collection of postwar records from displaced persons camps. The name index refers to 17.5 million victims, and the documents fill 16 miles of shelves. But the archive is indexed according to names, making it difficult to use them for historical research. Seized by the Allies from concentration camps and Nazi offices after of the war, the files were closed under a 1955 agreement to protect the privacy of survivors and the reputation of the dead who may have undergone humiliating medical experiments or been falsely accused of crimes. Last year's amendments to the 1955 accords, reached after years of negotiation and resistance by several members, stipulated that some privacy guarantees remain. A single copy of the documents would be available for each of the 11 member states to be used "on the premises of an appropriate archival repository." Each government was expected to take into account "the sensitivity of certain information" the files may contain, the new agreement said. In addition to the United States, and France indicated they also would seek copies. The seven countries that have ratified the treaty amendments are the United States, Israel, Poland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Britain.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20070515/sc_livescience/humanancestorhadapeabrain	Human Ancestor Had a Pea Brain - Yahoo! News Human Ancestor Had a Pea Brain Mon May 14, 8:15 PM ET Higher primates such as humans are considered the brainiacs of the mammalian world. But a 29-million-year-old fossilized skull suggests that one of our remote ancestors was a bit of a &ldquo;pea brain,&rdquo; sporting a noggin smaller than that of a modern lemur. The skull belonged to a common ancestor of humans, monkeys and apes. "This means the big-brained monkeys and apes developed their large brains at a later point in time,&rdquo; said lead study author Elwyn Simons, a Duke University primatologist. Until now, scientists had assumed brain size was a key feature that defined higher primates, a category that includes humans, . The larger brain relative to body size also has provided paleoanthropologists with a physical marker for the evolutionary distinction between higher and lower primates, which include lemurs of Madagascar.

The cranium was so well preserved the team used micro computed-tomography (CT) scanning, which relies on X-rays, to recreate the inside of the skull and calculate dimensions of the brain it once encased. He had found a similar, but fragmented skull at the site in 1966. Comparing dimensions of the old and new skull suggests the 1996 specimen belonged to a male, while the new skull was that of a female. The size of the female skull suggests it &ldquo;had a brain that might have been even smaller than that of a modern lemur&#39;s," Simons said. The new skull also suggests the species had a much smaller brain than was previously estimated based on the 1996 skull. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little surprising to find out that the brain volume on this thing indicates that maybe the New and Old World monkeys, their common ancestor had a prosimian-, or lower-primate-like brain like Aegyptopithecus does,&rdquo; Simons said.

News Human Ancestor Had a Pea Brain Mon May 14, 8:15 PM ET Higher primates such as humans are considered the brainiacs of the mammalian world. But a 29-million-year-old fossilized skull suggests that one of our remote ancestors was a bit of a &ldquo;pea brain,&rdquo; sporting a noggin smaller than that of a modern lemur. The skull belonged to a common ancestor of humans, monkeys and apes. "This means the big-brained monkeys and apes developed their large brains at a later point in time,&rdquo; said lead study author Elwyn Simons, a Duke University primatologist. Until now, scientists had assumed brain size was a key feature that defined higher primates, a category that includes humans, . The larger brain relative to body size also has provided paleoanthropologists with a physical marker for the evolutionary distinction between higher and lower primates, which include lemurs of Madagascar. Tiny enough to fit into the palm of your hand, the skull comes from a female Aegyptopithecus zeuxis, which means &ldquo;linking Egyptian ape.&rdquo; This lived about 33 million years ago, a time when primates were evolving rapidly. The cat-size primate ate fruits and leaves in a tropical rainforest in what is now the Fayum in Egypt.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_bi_ge/tyco_settlement	Tyco paying &#36;3 billion to settle lawsuit - Yahoo! News Tyco paying &#36;3 billion to settle lawsuit By KATHARINE WEBSTER, Associated Press Writer CONCORD, N.H. - Tyco International Ltd. has agreed to pay about $3 billion to settle shareholder claims from one of the largest corporate fraud cases ever, ending uncertainty over the outcome of the legal battle as it prepares to split into three companies. Tyco said Tuesday it would set up a $2.975 billion cash fund to pay claims filed by shareholders against the company arising from actions by ex-chief executive L. Dennis Kozlowski and other top officers convicted of looting the company and inflating its value. Tyco said it would take a charge of that amount during the current quarter. Tyco spokesman Paul Fitzhenry said the company also would pay interest on the $2.975 billion and turn over half of any money it recovers from ongoing lawsuits against Kozlowski, former Chief Operating Officer Mark Swartz and former board member Frank Walsh. "With this settlement, we are taking an important step to resolve our most significant remaining legacy legal matter," Chairman and Chief Executive Ed Breen said in a statement. "Our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong and will allow us to readily absorb these costs while removing much of the uncertainty around legacy legal matters." Investors, including union and state pension funds and Tyco retirees, were permitted last summer to proceed with a consolidated class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in New Hampshire, where Tyco was formerly headquartered. The settlement still must be approved by the largest shareholders and the court. The settlement covers shareholders from December 1999 to June 2002 and, in some of the consolidated cases, investors who owned stock starting in October 1998, the company said. Tyco's share price rose 19 cents to $32.38 Tuesday. Tyco is breaking up into three publicly traded companies: Tyco Healthcare, which will be renamed Covidien and based in Mansfield, Mass.; Tyco Electronics, to be based in Berwyn, Pa., near Philadelphia; and Tyco International, which will remain in New Jersey and include the fire and security and engineered products units. The breakup has been delayed twice, but is now slated for the end of June. Lawyers for the shareholders said the settlement would top $3 billion with interest, making it the largest payout ever by a single corporate defendant in a securities fraud lawsuit. "This is a fantastic resolution and closes a chapter on one of the largest and most appalling examples of corporate fraud in U.S. history," said Jay Eisenhofer, managing partner at Grant & Eisenhofer. Total settlements involving securities fraud lawsuits against Enron Corp. ($7.1 billion) and WorldCom Inc. ($6.1 billion) were larger, but those companies are now bankrupt and the payments were made primarily by outside co-defendants including investment banks and auditors. Cendant Corp. agreed to settle a shareholder lawsuit for $2.83 billion in December 1999. "This is a settlement of historic proportions for the investors who suffered significant financial losses and it also sends a strong message to those who would engage in this type of misconduct in the future," said Richard Schiffrin, of Schiffrin, Barroway, Topaz & Kessler. Shareholder claims against the company's former auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are still pending, so the total amount recovered by shareholders could be larger, Eisenhofer said. Tyco also has agreed to assign its claims against PricewaterhouseCoopers to the shareholders, who will pursue them "vigorously" alongside the shareholders' existing claims, Eisenhofer said. "The fraud couldn't have taken place without them. They totally abdicated their responsibility as independent auditor, and had they performed as they should have, this fraud wouldn't have taken place," he said. PricewaterhouseCoopers spokesman David Nestor declined to comment. The portion of the settlement that will go toward attorneys' fees has not been determined yet, Eisenhofer said. Kozlowski and Swartz were convicted in a New York State court in 2005 of multiple counts of grand larceny, conspiracy, securities fraud and falsifying business records. Prosecutors said the two conspired to defraud Tyco of $600 million to fund their extravagant lifestyles. They were sentenced in September 2006 to eight to 25 years in prison. A judge refused to release them on bail while they appeal. The shareholders' lawsuits alleged the company misrepresented the value of Tyco and companies it acquired under Kozlowski's leadership in a giant accounting fraud scheme, causing losses estimated at $1 billion to $2 billion. Tyco makes everything from telecommunications equipment to home alarm systems. The company, which is registered in Bermuda, was run from Exeter, N.H., at the time of the alleged fraud. It now operates from West Windsor, N.J.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_bi_ge/tyco_settlement	Tyco paying &#36;3 billion to settle lawsuit - Yahoo! News Tyco paying &#36;3 billion to settle lawsuit By KATHARINE WEBSTER, Associated Press Writer CONCORD, N.H. - Tyco International Ltd. has agreed to pay about $3 billion to settle shareholder claims from one of the largest corporate fraud cases ever, ending uncertainty over the outcome of the legal battle as it prepares to split into three companies. Tyco said Tuesday it would set up a $2.975 billion cash fund to pay claims filed by shareholders against the company arising from actions by ex-chief executive L. Dennis Kozlowski and other top officers convicted of looting the company and inflating its value. Tyco said it would take a charge of that amount during the current quarter. Tyco spokesman Paul Fitzhenry said the company also would pay interest on the $2.975 billion and turn over half of any money it recovers from ongoing lawsuits against Kozlowski, former Chief Operating Officer Mark Swartz and former board member Frank Walsh. "With this settlement, we are taking an important step to resolve our most significant remaining legacy legal matter," Chairman and Chief Executive Ed Breen said in a statement. "Our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong and will allow us to readily absorb these costs while removing much of the uncertainty around legacy legal matters." Investors, including union and state pension funds and Tyco retirees, were permitted last summer to proceed with a consolidated class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in New Hampshire, where Tyco was formerly headquartered. The settlement still must be approved by the largest shareholders and the court. The settlement covers shareholders from December 1999 to June 2002 and, in some of the consolidated cases, investors who owned stock starting in October 1998, the company said. Tyco's share price rose 19 cents to $32.38 Tuesday. Tyco is breaking up into three publicly traded companies: Tyco Healthcare, which will be renamed Covidien and based in Mansfield, Mass.; Tyco Electronics, to be based in Berwyn, Pa., near Philadelphia; and Tyco International, which will remain in New Jersey and include the fire and security and engineered products units. The breakup has been delayed twice, but is now slated for the end of June. Lawyers for the shareholders said the settlement would top $3 billion with interest, making it the largest payout ever by a single corporate defendant in a securities fraud lawsuit. "This is a fantastic resolution and closes a chapter on one of the largest and most appalling examples of corporate fraud in U.S. history," said Jay Eisenhofer, managing partner at Grant & Eisenhofer. Total settlements involving securities fraud lawsuits against Enron Corp. ($7.1 billion) and WorldCom Inc. ($6.1 billion) were larger, but those companies are now bankrupt and the payments were made primarily by outside co-defendants including investment banks and auditors. Cendant Corp. agreed to settle a shareholder lawsuit for $2.83 billion in December 1999. "This is a settlement of historic proportions for the investors who suffered significant financial losses and it also sends a strong message to those who would engage in this type of misconduct in the future," said Richard Schiffrin, of Schiffrin, Barroway, Topaz & Kessler. Shareholder claims against the company's former auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are still pending, so the total amount recovered by shareholders could be larger, Eisenhofer said. Tyco also has agreed to assign its claims against PricewaterhouseCoopers to the shareholders, who will pursue them "vigorously" alongside the shareholders' existing claims, Eisenhofer said. "The fraud couldn't have taken place without them. They totally abdicated their responsibility as independent auditor, and had they performed as they should have, this fraud wouldn't have taken place," he said. PricewaterhouseCoopers spokesman David Nestor declined to comment. The portion of the settlement that will go toward attorneys' fees has not been determined yet, Eisenhofer said. Kozlowski and Swartz were convicted in a New York State court in 2005 of multiple counts of grand larceny, conspiracy, securities fraud and falsifying business records. Prosecutors said the two conspired to defraud Tyco of $600 million to fund their extravagant lifestyles. They were sentenced in September 2006 to eight to 25 years in prison. A judge refused to release them on bail while they appeal. The shareholders' lawsuits alleged the company misrepresented the value of Tyco and companies it acquired under Kozlowski's leadership in a giant accounting fraud scheme, causing losses estimated at $1 billion to $2 billion. Tyco makes everything from telecommunications equipment to home alarm systems. The company, which is registered in Bermuda, was run from Exeter, N.H., at the time of the alleged fraud. It now operates from West Windsor, N.J.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/jerry_falwell	TV evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 - Yahoo! News TV evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 By SUE LINDSEY, Associated Press Writer LYNCHBURG, Va. - The Rev. Jerry Falwell, the folksy, small-town preacher who used the power of television to found the Moral Majority and turn the Christian right into a mighty force in American politics during the Reagan years, died Tuesday at 73. Falwell was discovered without a pulse in his office at Liberty University and pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later. Dr. Carl Moore, Falwell's physician, said he had a heart condition and presumably died of a heart rhythm abnormality. Driven into politics by the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that established the right to an abortion, Falwell founded the Moral Majority in 1979. One of the conservative lobbying group's greatest triumphs came just a year later, when Falwell credited the Moral Majority with getting millions of conservative voters registered, aiding in Reagan's victory and giving Republicans control of the Senate. "I shudder to think where the country would be right now if the religious right had not evolved," he said when he stepped down as Moral Majority president in 1987. Fellow TV evangelist Pat Robertson, himself a one-time GOP candidate for president, declared Falwell "a tower of strength on many of the moral issues which have confronted our nation." The rise of Christian conservatism &#151; and the Moral Majority's full-throated condemnation of homosexuality, abortion and pornography &#151; made Falwell perhaps the most recognizable figure on the evangelical right, and one of the most controversial ones, too. Over the years, Falwell waged a landmark libel case against Hustler magazine founder Larry Flynt over a raunchy parody ad, and created a furor in 1999 when one of his publications suggested that the purse-carrying "Teletubbies" character Tinky Winky was gay. Matt Foreman, executive director of National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, extended condolences to those close to Falwell, but added: "Unfortunately, we will always remember him as a founder and leader of America's anti-gay industry, someone who exacerbated the nation's appalling response to the onslaught of the epidemic, someone who demonized and vilified us for political gain and someone who used religion to divide rather than unite our nation." The 1980s marked the religious conservative movement's high-water mark. In more recent years, Falwell had become a problematic figure for the GOP. His remarks a few days after Sept. 11, 2001, essentially blaming feminists, gays and liberals for bringing on the terrorist attacks drew a rebuke from the White House, and he apologized. Falwell's declining political star seemed apparent when he quietly led in and out of the Republican Party's 2004 national convention. Just four years earlier, he was invited to pray from the rostrum. The big, blue-eyed preacher with a booming voice started a fundamentalist church in an abandoned bottling plant in Lynchburg in 1956 with just 35 members. He built it into a religious empire that included the 22,000-member Thomas Road Baptist Church, the "Old Time Gospel Hour" carried on TV stations around the country and 7,700-student Liberty University, which Falwell founded in 1971 as Lynchburg Baptist College. From his living room, he broadcast his message of salvation and raised the donations that helped his ministry grow. "He was one of the first to come up with ways to use television to expand his ministry," said Robert Alley, a retired University of Richmond religion professor who studied and criticized Falwell's career. Falwell had once opposed mixing preaching with politics, but changed his views. The Moral Majority grew to 6.5 million members and raised $69 million as it supported conservative politicians and railed against abortion, homosexuality, pornography and bans on school prayer. Falwell became the face of the religious right, appearing on national magazine covers and on talk shows. In 1983, U.S. News & World Report named him one of 25 most influential people in America. "Dr. Falwell was a man of distinguished accomplishment who devoted his life to serving his faith and country," said Sen. John McCain ( ), a GOP presidential contender who during the 2000 primaries referred to Falwell and Robertson as "agents of intolerance." McCain has since distanced himself from those comments. In 1984, Falwell sued Hustler for $45 million, charging that he was libeled by an liquor-ad parody that quoted him as saying he lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse. A federal jury found the fake ad did not libel him, but awarded him $200,000 for emotional distress. The verdict was overturned in a landmark 1988 decision that held that even pornographic spoofs about a public figure enjoy First Amendment protection. With Falwell's high profile came frequent criticism, even from fellow ministers. The Rev. Billy Graham once rebuked him for political sermonizing on "non-moral issues." Falwell quit the Moral Majority in 1987, saying he was tired of being "a lightning rod" and wanted to devote his time to his ministry and Liberty University. But he remained outspoken and continued to draw criticism for his remarks. In 1999, he told an evangelical conference that the Antichrist was a male Jew who was probably already alive. Falwell later apologized for the remark but not for holding the belief. A month later, his National Liberty Journal warned parents that Tinky Winky, the children's TV character, was a gay role model and morally damaging to children. Falwell was re-energized after family values proved important in the 2004 presidential election. He formed the Faith and Values Coalition as the "21st Century resurrection of the Moral Majority," to seek anti-abortion judges, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and more conservative elected officials. In 1987, Falwell took over the PTL (Praise the Lord) ministry in South Carolina after the Rev. Jim Bakker got caught in a sex and money scandal. Falwell slid fully clothed down a theme park water slide after donors met his fundraising goal to help rescue the rival ministry. He gave it up seven months later after learning the depth of PTL's financial problems. Largely because of the sex scandals involving Bakker and fellow evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, donations to Falwell's ministry dropped from $135 million in 1986 to less than $100 million the following year. Hundreds of workers were laid off and viewers of his television show dwindled. Liberty University was $73 million in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy, and his "Old Time Gospel Hour" was $16 million in debt. By the mid-1990s, two local businessmen with long ties to Falwell began overseeing the finances and helped get companies to forgive debts or write them off. Falwell dreamed that Liberty would grow to 50,000 students and be to fundamentalist Christians what Notre Dame is to Roman Catholics and Brigham Young University is to Mormons. Falwell's father and his grandfather were militant atheists, he wrote in his autobiography. He said his father made a fortune off his businesses &#151; including bootlegging during Prohibition. As a student, Falwell was a star athlete and a prankster who was barred from giving his high school valedictorian's speech after he was caught using counterfeit lunch tickets. He ran with a gang of juvenile delinquents before becoming a born-again Christian at 19. He turned down an offer to play professional baseball and transferred from Lynchburg College to Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Mo. "My heart was burning to serve Christ," he once said in an interview. "I knew nothing would ever be the same again." Falwell had made careful preparations for a transition of his leadership to his two sons, Jerry Falwell, Jr., now vice chancellor of Liberty University, and Jonathan Falwell, executive the pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church. Falwell is survived by his wife, Macel, his two sons and a daughter, Jeannie Falwell Savas. Funeral arrangements were not immediately known. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Mormon whose own faith has become an issue during his run for the presidency, said Falwell "built and led a movement based on strong principles and strong faith," and "the legacy of his important work will continue through his many ministries where he put his faith into action."

News French workers biggest whiners, Irish happiest: study Mon May 14, 10:31 AM ET LONDON (AFP) - French workers are the world&#39;s biggest whiners, according to a study published Monday which said the Irish complain least about their lot. Britons come second to their Gallic cousins in the moaning stakes, followed by Sweden, the United States and Australia. Japanese workers have the lowest morale, but don&#39;t complain so much. The lowest levels of whining were found in the Netherlands, Thailand and Ireland, according to the study by the FDS research group. "It is interesting to note that after France, Britain and Sweden, the world&#39;s biggest workplace whingers are Americans, despite their having by far the highest levels of income," said FDS chief Charlotte Cornish. "Compare them to Thai workers: while real levels of income are more than eight times higher in the States, more workers in the US feel their pay is a problem than in Thailand," she added. The study, entitled "What Workers Want, A Worldwide Study of Attitudes to Work and Work-Life Balance", draws on data from 14,000 employees in 23 countries. They were notably asked about their satisfaction with issues including pay levels and their work-life balance, as well as average working hours. In terms of worker morale, Dutch workers are the happiest, followed by their Thai and Irish counterparts. The lowest morale of all is found in Japan, followed by Germany, said the study. The study&#39;s authors noted that rightwing French President-elect Nicolas Sarkozy shouldn&#39;t expect things to become happier anytime soon, as he prepares to shake up notoriously strike-prone France. "The UK and US, with their marked competitive individualism and unequal wealth distribution, both appear towards the top of the world&#39;s list of whingiest workers," said Cornish. "The French come out on top -- it seems unlikely that Nicolas Sarkozy&#39;s election and the likely shift to more Anglo-Saxon economic practices will make the workers in France any more happy with their lot," she added.

In terms of worker morale, Dutch workers are the happiest, followed by their Thai and Irish counterparts. The lowest morale of all is found in Japan, followed by Germany, said the study. The study&#39;s authors noted that rightwing French President-elect Nicolas Sarkozy shouldn&#39;t expect things to become happier anytime soon, as he prepares to shake up notoriously strike-prone France. "The UK and US, with their marked competitive individualism and unequal wealth distribution, both appear towards the top of the world&#39;s list of whingiest workers," said Cornish. "The French come out on top -- it seems unlikely that Nicolas Sarkozy&#39;s election and the likely shift to more Anglo-Saxon economic practices will make the workers in France any more happy with their lot," she added.

News ABC network adds 11 new series By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer 2 hours, 21 minutes ago NEW YORK - ABC scheduled its "Grey's Anatomy" spinoff for Wednesdays and committed to a comedy derived from the Geico "Cavemen" commercials as part of an ambitious schedule with eight new series for the fall and 11 overall. The third-place network lost an average of a million viewers in prime-time from last season, many attributable to the end of "Monday Night Football." With bankable hits "Grey's Anatomy," "Desperate Housewives" and "Dancing With the Stars" returning, ABC is giving viewers plenty of new choices in the fall. That approach contrasts with fourth-place NBC, which is introducing half as many new series under the theory that it's tough to market so many new shows. The most anticipated new ABC series is "Private Practice," which takes Dr. Addison Shepard (Kate Walsh) from Seattle and moves her to Los Angeles. A special "Grey's Anatomy" that served as the show's pilot was seen by 21 million people earlier this month. The new series will air Wednesdays at 9 p.m., part of a night with all-new programming. Despite the high hopes, ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson indicated Tuesday that creator Shonda Rhimes has work ahead of her. In the pilot, he said, "we spent a lot of time introducing the characters and not enough time introducing the stories." "Cavemen" takes the commercial characters and sets them up in Atlanta, trying to live like normal guys in their 30s. The series pokes fun at the normally serious topic of racial attitudes, but since they're cavemen "it gives you kind of the ability to offend everybody but offend no one," McPherson said. The pilot has already gotten some poor word-of-mouth, but McPherson urged caution. Out of 17 drama pilots ABC tested before audiences last season, eventual hit "Ugly Betty" did worse than all but one, he said. After serial dramas on dark topics failed last season, ABC leaned more toward series that don't need an intense commitment to follow. Lighter, fantasy-oriented topics are also evident, with series on a lawyer with visions, a man who can bring dead people to life and ambitious executives. "People didn't show up for these shows (last year)," McPherson said. "It wasn't a matter of seeing a show and rejecting it. People didn't show up. So we listened to that." The network canceled the comedies " ," "Help Me Help You" and "Knights of Prosperity." "What About Brian" did not make the cut, and ABC is still debating the future of "According to Jim," while leaving it off the fall schedule. The cancellation angered Lopez, who complained in the Los Angeles Times that his comedy about a Latino family is being dumped in favor of cavemen. "TV just became really, really white again," Lopez said. The first prime-time series from 's Harpo Productions, "Oprah's Big Give," will debut in midseason. It's a reality series where contestants compete in philanthropy. In contrast to last year, when "Grey's Anatomy" made its successful switch to Thursday nights, ABC plans no major shifts of its existing series. "Men in Trees" moves to an earlier time slot on Friday nights. "Lost" will return in midseason, but ABC made no time slot commitment. Other new series that ABC plans for next season: _"Pushing Daisies," a "forensic fairy tale" about a young man who can bring dead people to life with his touch. He does that for his childhood sweetheart, only to learn that if he touches her again, she's dead for good. _"Dirty Sexy Money," a trashy prime-time soap about the venal Darling family of New York. Family members include , William Baldwin and Jill Clayburgh. _"Big Shots," a drama about four hard-charging friends and CEOs who are less successful with women. play the lead characters. _"Cashmere Mafia," ABC's attempt to inherit the "Sex and the City" mantle. Four women, friends since business school, juggle their personal and professional lives in New York. NBC has a similar new show with three women. ABC's show has _"Sam I Am," a comedy with about a woman who awakes from a coma with no memory, only to find out she was a creep before. _"Eli Stone," a drama about a top lawyer in San Francisco who begins having visions because of a brain aneurysm, only to find his firm has a bunch of creeps. _"Women's Murder Club," a drama, is also set in San Francisco. Based on James Patterson novels, it's about four crime-fighting women &#151; a detective, district attorney, medical examiner and reporter. _"Carpoolers," a comedy about four men from different backgrounds who get together each day for some male bonding on the drive to work. _"Miss/Guided," a comedy about a former high school geek who returns to her alma mater as a guidance counselor, only to see an ex-cheerleader and former nemesis come back as an English teacher.

News French workers biggest whiners, Irish happiest: study Mon May 14, 10:31 AM ET LONDON (AFP) - French workers are the world&#39;s biggest whiners, according to a study published Monday which said the Irish complain least about their lot. Britons come second to their Gallic cousins in the moaning stakes, followed by Sweden, the United States and Australia. Japanese workers have the lowest morale, but don&#39;t complain so much. The lowest levels of whining were found in the Netherlands, Thailand and Ireland, according to the study by the FDS research group. "It is interesting to note that after France, Britain and Sweden, the world&#39;s biggest workplace whingers are Americans, despite their having by far the highest levels of income," said FDS chief Charlotte Cornish. "Compare them to Thai workers: while real levels of income are more than eight times higher in the States, more workers in the US feel their pay is a problem than in Thailand," she added. The study, entitled "What Workers Want, A Worldwide Study of Attitudes to Work and Work-Life Balance", draws on data from 14,000 employees in 23 countries. They were notably asked about their satisfaction with issues including pay levels and their work-life balance, as well as average working hours. In terms of worker morale, Dutch workers are the happiest, followed by their Thai and Irish counterparts. The lowest morale of all is found in Japan, followed by Germany, said the study. The study&#39;s authors noted that rightwing French President-elect Nicolas Sarkozy shouldn&#39;t expect things to become happier anytime soon, as he prepares to shake up notoriously strike-prone France. "The UK and US, with their marked competitive individualism and unequal wealth distribution, both appear towards the top of the world&#39;s list of whingiest workers," said Cornish. "The French come out on top -- it seems unlikely that Nicolas Sarkozy&#39;s election and the likely shift to more Anglo-Saxon economic practices will make the workers in France any more happy with their lot," she added.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_au_an/people_stallone	Stallone pleads guilty to import charges - Yahoo! News Stallone pleads guilty to import charges By MERAIAH FOLEY, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 2:08 AM ET SYDNEY, Australia - Actor Sylvester Stallone pleaded guilty Tuesday to bringing vials of restricted muscle-building hormones into Australia and faces sentencing next week. Lawyers for the 60-year-old star of the "Rocky" and "Rambo" movies entered the guilty pleas on behalf of the actor, who did not appear before Sydney's Downing Center Local Court. "I made a terrible mistake, not because I was attempting to deceive anyone but I was simply ignorant to your official rules," Stallone said in a letter to Sydney's Local Court. "I feel terrible that my breach of the rules has set a poor example to members of the public, whose opinion I cherish dearly." Stallone was accused of bringing banned substances into Australia after a customs search of his luggage during a Feb. 16 visit to Sydney revealed 48 vials of the human growth hormone product, Jintropin. Three days later, Stallone threw four vials of the male hormone testosterone from his Sydney hotel room when customs officials arrived to search it, prosecutor David Agius told the court. Human growth hormone, a naturally occurring substance that can be replicated synthetically and is used to build muscle mass, is considered a performance enhancing drug in Australia and it cannot be imported without a permit from the national drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration. The maximum penalty for bringing Jintropin into Australia illegally is a fine of $91,500 and five years in prison, but Stallone faces a maximum penalty of just $18,000 on each of the two charges because the matter is being heard by a local, not federal, court. Deputy Chief Magistrate Paul Cloran said Stallone would be sentenced on Monday next week. Stallone's lawyer Phillip Boulten said the actor should be spared a criminal conviction, saying Stallone took the hormones for medical reasons that he did not specify. "The defendant, Sylvester Stallone, is extremely mortified about having been involved in this incident," Boulten told the court. "Had he known that what he was doing was contrary to Australian law, he almost certainly would not have done it." But Agius said Stallone had demonstrated a "consciousness of guilt" by throwing the testosterone from the hotel. Boulten said Stallone was taking both substances under medical supervision. "This is not some back-alley body builder dealing covertly with some banned substance in some sort of secret way," he said. "This was a legitimate medical condition being treated by doctors of the top ranking order in the west coast of the United States." Agius told Cloran that Stallone was to have appeared in the court through a video link but that that plan had been abandoned. Agius did not elaborate. Prosecution documents handed to the court in March said Stallone had marked "No" on a customs declaration card that asked if he was bringing into Australia restricted or prohibited goods "such as medicines, steroids, firearms, weapons, or any kind of illicit drugs." During his visit to Australia, Stallone shrugged off the airport incident. "It was just a minor misunderstanding," Stallone told reporters "They were just doing their jobs. I just didn't understand some of the rules here." He came to Australia on a three-day tour to promote the latest movie in the "Rocky" series, "Rocky Balboa." A media throng was kept waiting for hours outside Sydney International Airport for the actor and his entourage. When a tightlipped Stallone emerged, he signed his autograph for several fans but avoided media questions about the delay.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070514/sc_nm/sleep_light_dc	Mars experiment might help Earthling insomniacs - Yahoo! News Mars experiment might help Earthling insomniacs By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor Mon May 14, 6:15 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An experiment aimed at finding ways to help astronauts adapt to life on Mars could end up helping insomniacs on Earth, researchers said on Monday. They found that two 45-minute exposures to bright light in the evening could help people adjust to a longer, Martian-style day. During the experiment, they found a wider-than-expected variation in an internal system the human body uses to keep track of days and nights, and they believe their treatment might help people with certain disorders of this system. "The results have powerful implications for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including shift work disorder and advanced sleep phase disorder," said Dr. Charles Czeisler, chief of the Division of Sleep Medicine at Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital and Harvard medical school in Boston. The U.S. space agency had asked Czeisler&#39;s lab to find ways to help astronauts adjust to life on Mars, where the days are about 24 hours and 39 minutes long, or 24.65 hours. This nearly 25-hour day is enough to throw most people into a state of jet lag, which Czeisler has shown interferes with the ability to learn, remember things, react quickly and to sleep. His team tested 12 healthy volunteers aged 22 to 33 who had kept a regular eight-hour sleep and 16-hour wakeful schedule at home for at least three weeks. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences National Academy of Sciences , they said the natural range of circadian days in just their group was from 23.47 hours to 24.48 hour days -- a full hour&#39;s difference. Tests on animals has shown there is a natural variation. Daylight tweaks the genetically determined circadian rhythm. "In virtually all cases, the exposure that we get to light ... keeps us in sync with the 24-hour day," Czeisler said in a telephone interview. But what "astounded" Czeisler was an additional difference in hormone release. They took blood from these volunteers every hour and found those people with the shorter internal clock released the sleep hormone melatonin four to five hours before their usual bedtimes, while those with unusually long internal days did not release melatonin until about an hour before bedtime. Other research has shown that using a computer after dark, working in a brightly lit office or other exposure to bright light can mess up a person&#39;s internal clock, making it harder to fall asleep. So Czeisler&#39;s team tested the volunteers in a similar way, using two 45-minute exposures to bright light for 30 days. The volunteers successfully adjusted to the Martian-length day, Czeisler said. This could mean that light therapy might help people whose insomnia is caused by having a long- or shorter-than-normal internal body clock, Czeisler said.

The corpse, preserved by salty air in the seaside town of Roses after an apparent death by natural causes, was discovered by Jorge Giro, who entered the house for the first time on Saturday after buying it at the auction, El Pais said. The dead woman, described by neighbors as having been in poor health and often absent visiting relatives in Madrid, had stopped paying her mortgage six years ago.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070514/ap_on_en_ot/mr__pop_culture	Syracuse prof is pop culture ambassador - Yahoo! News Syracuse prof is pop culture ambassador By JOCELYN NOVECK, AP National Writer Mon May 14, 3:33 PM ET SYRACUSE, N.Y. - Last week was pretty slow in the world of pop culture news. But the media sought out Robert Thompson just the same. The Syracuse University professor was quoted on the image of motherhood on TV. On the phenomenon of animal shows on cable. The danger of Hollywood trilogies. 's future. The hipness of being a nerd. Such exposure is nothing unusual for Thompson, a font of pop culture knowledge like few others. There may well be an expert somewhere who has a more wide-ranging, obsessive knowledge of this highly amorphous subject. But if so, they're keeping quiet about it. And it would be hard for the amiable, 47-year-old Thompson to keep quiet at this point, even if he wanted to. Because reporters from all over the world would keep calling &#151; to get his witty analysis of Katie Couric's debut on CBS, of vintage furniture, of the growth of barbecue culture. He's been called, half-jokingly, the most quoted man in America. That's not exactly true; we do have a president. But on certain days, when the pop culture firmament is busy, well, just Google his name. "I've seen Bob get 60, 70, 80 media calls in one day," says the man who hired him at Syracuse, David Rubin, dean of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. "I've seen him in a hallway on his cell phone for hours. You could go so far as to say Bob is the most quoted academic in the United States." So often has Thompson been quoted, over 17 years at Syracuse, that some news organizations (including The Associated Press) have lately tried consciously NOT to quote him. But nobody said we couldn't write ABOUT him. So while Syracuse, the seat of Onondaga County, about 250 miles from New York City, would hardly seem a mecca of pop culture, it seems a worthwhile journey to meet one of the only men on the planet capable of riffing rhapsodically, on cue, about the history of the aluminum lawn chair. The first thing you notice in Thompson's office are the TV sets. Not because three in one office is so unusual &#151; though this office does seem rather spacious for an academic, not to mention the view &#151; but because of what's playing. Not CNN or Fox News, but an episode of "The Show" on TV Land. TV is Thompson's passion; his office shelves are lined with old VHS tapes filled with countless hours of shows. A short walk away is the lecture hall where he teaches his spring undergraduate class. On this, the last day of the semester, Thompson has three hours to wrap up the history of television. He whips into action, starting with the early '50s and Lucy and Desi. Before you can say "Hill Street Blues" he's up to the '80s &#151; the second "Golden Age" of television &#151; by way of "Quincy" and "Barnaby Jones." At the turn of the century, Thompson argues, television is at its all-time best, with HBO the crown jewel. "The Larry Sanders Show." "Oz." "Sex and the City." "The Sopranos." "Rome." And so on. He turns to reality TV, which, in a typically sweeping yet concise Thompson-ism, he calls "the most interesting new way to tell a story since the invention of the novel." It began in Britain, he explains, and then "the virus jumped over the Atlantic and spread." "Survivor" is dissected. So is "Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?" and "Temptation Island." Have you ever noticed how conservative "The Bachelor" is, he muses, with all these girls waiting for a kiss? Stephanie from South Carolina has recently been rejected by bachelor Andy, he notes. Yes, he does watch all this stuff. Now he broaches the "single biggest event in all of TV history" &#151; coverage of the 9/11 terror attacks. He plays a good hour of CNN from that awful morning, reminding the students, most of whom were about 14 then, how it felt to watch the twin towers collapse on live TV. When he later plays segments of an MTV documentary on pop culture post-9/11, no one flinches when one of its featured commentators turns out to be Thompson. The students are used to it. The class ends with society's current fixation on YouTube, the wildly popular video-sharing site. And one lesson from that, he notes, is how our collective attention span has shrunk. We can't watch a YouTube clip that's more than a few minutes long. To prove it, he plays a tedious clip of someone's pet cat playing the piano. "Seven minutes," another Thompson-ism goes, "is the new 'War and Peace.'" Back in his office later that evening, Thompson explains the genesis of his interest in pop culture. He did his undergraduate work at the University of Chicago, where he initially planned to be an art history professor. But on Sunday nights, when the dorms didn't serve food, he would eat takeout in front of the TV. He found that he chose "CHiPs," with , over PBS, and became fascinated with the question: "Why do smart people watch dumb TV?" He did his thesis on Dante's "Divine Comedy," but came to believe that "art could be something that came out of a TV set." That led to a broader interest in popular culture. "I realized that to understand TV you needed to understand the network radio era. And vaudeville. And the circus. And comic strips. Every year I would binge on something." He did his masters and doctorate at Northwestern, and arrived in 1990 at Syracuse, where he now heads the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture. Over the years, reaction from traditional academics to his chosen field has become much less hostile, he says. "Now, there isn't a university that doesn't have a course on the history of rock 'n' roll," he notes. Thompson, who's written or edited six books of his own, gets up each day at five to read; he consumes three new books a week, not to mention uncounted hours of TV. (He also has a family that he spends time with.) He's constantly becoming enamored with new areas of pop culture. A couple years ago, for example, he realized he didn't know enough about Shakespeare &#151; a pop culture figure of his time, after all. He decided to watch all existing plays on VHS or DVD. In three months he watched 113 plays and read 25 books on the bard. "I was crazed," he says contentedly. Then there's his interest in the webbed aluminum lawn chair. "They're really taken for granted," he says. He's happy to explain how the phenomenon began with extra metal from wartime scrap drives, combined with explosive growth in America's suburbs. Right now, Thompson's focusing his pop-culture lens on ancient times. "I'm interested in the celebrity culture of ancient Rome," he says. "Back then, as now, it was who you knew that got you into parties." It dovetails with a broader Thompson thesis: So many things that we think are new, really aren't. "American Idol," you say? Nothing new, he replies. Remember Ted Mack's "Original Amateur Hour?" It's not just the breadth of Thompson's interests that make him so quotable. It's his accessibility &#151; he returns phone calls promptly &#151; and the un-academic way he speaks: in snappy sentences that are easy to digest. "I don't speak in clauses," he acknowledges. "I believe in periods." Some might actually say he speaks in soundbites &#151; the media gossip site Jossip.com has in fact drily called him "Mr. Soundbite," and Thompson himself notes he's been called a "quote whore." But reporters point out that he thinks hard to come up with something different and interesting. "Unlike many people in his position, he almost always finds an angle or perspective that I hadn't thought about," says AP Television Writer David Bauder. Angela Nelson, a professor at Bowling Green State University, says Thompson is "performing a great service for the discipline. Television in particular has been seen to be trivial, and his paying attention to it and preserving it is good for the culture." Nelson is the head of her university's Popular Culture department &#151; the only full department in the country devoted to the subject, established in the 1970s. (Most pop culture courses are nestled in other departments like English, communications, or sociology.) Thompson has been quoted so often, at least one reporter has told him of a "moratorium" at their newspaper on quoting him. One can see why editors would notice. At The New York Times alone, an archive search shows Thompson quoted more than 40 times in the last four years, by writers in a wide range of areas. At the AP, he's been quoted close to 20 times in the past year. "These days, answers are so predictable, crafted and cliche," says journalism teacher , of the Poynter Institute in Florida. "Somebody who thinks on their feet, relies on a well of knowledge and is curious about the world at large can be an invaluable resource." Clark, who notes he's unfamiliar with Thompson, adds: "As long as it doesn't turn journalists into lazybones." Thompson says he's weary of the most-quoted-guy label, but Rubin, his dean, says: "Bob is very proud of his status. He's just got a certain modesty about him." He adds that Thompson is not at all hierarchical: If a school paper calls before a major news organization, they'll get the return call first. As a teacher, Thompson is said to be generous with his time, though he's known as a tough grader &#151; something that can disappoint a student hoping to get an easy ride in a pop culture class. "He really has a lot of time for his students," says Carolyn Davis, a doctoral student in media studies who assisted Thompson this semester. "People will come in just to talk, and he'll order lunch." In any case, the university loves his star status. "My job is to keep Bob happy," says Rubin. Thompson says he learns from the give-and-take with the media. Besides, it's a teacher's job to preach what he knows &#151; and Thompson feels Americans need a basic working knowledge of their own pop culture. "To understand the history of this nation," he says, leaving you with one last Thompson-ism, "you have to understand its presidents and its wars. "But you also need to understand its lawn ornaments and its cheeseburgers."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_eu/netherlands_nazi_archive	Diplomats agree to transfer Nazi archive - Yahoo! News Diplomats agree to transfer Nazi archive By ARTHUR MAX, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 10:53 AM ET AMSTERDAM, Netherlands - Diplomats from 11 countries agreed Tuesday to bypass legal obstacles and begin distributing electronic copies of documents from a secretive Nazi archive, making them available to Holocaust researchers for the first time in more than a half century. The decision was meant to avoid further delays in allowing Holocaust survivors to find their own stories and family histories, and for historians to seek new insights into Europe's darkest period. The countries governing the archive maintained by the International Tracing Service approved a plan to begin transferring scanned documents as soon as they are ready so that receiving institutions can begin preparing them for public use, said a delegate, requesting anonymity because a formal announcement was due later Tuesday. The decision circumvents the requirement to withhold the documents until all 11 countries ratify the 2006 treaty amendments that enabled the unsealing of the documents. Ratification is still pending in four countries, and Tuesday's vote was likely to shave several months from the distribution timetable. Until now, the files maintained in the central German town of Bad Arolsen have been used to track missing people, reunite families, and later to validate restitution claims. The Tracing Service is an arm of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Three countries, the United States, France and Germany, pledged to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to offset costs for preparing and transmitting the papers, said the delegate. But some U.S. survivors expressed dismay that the documents will remain restricted to a single place &#151; the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington &#151; and that they won't have unfettered access. "I'm anxious, because 105 people from my immediate family did not make it. I am the only survivor," said David Schaecter, of Miami, Fla. "How do I obtain what I am rightfully entitled to obtain &#151; (to know) what happened to these 105 people," he said. The archive contains Nazi records on the arrest, transportation, incarceration, forced labor and deaths of millions of people from the year the Nazis built their first concentration camp in 1933 to the end of the war. It also has a vast collection of postwar records from displaced persons camps. The name index refers to 17.5 million victims, and the documents fill 16 miles of shelves. But the archive is indexed according to names, making it difficult to use them for historical research. Seized by the Allies from concentration camps and Nazi offices after of the war, the files were closed under a 1955 agreement to protect the privacy of survivors and the reputation of the dead who may have undergone humiliating medical experiments or been falsely accused of crimes. Last year's amendments to the 1955 accords, reached after years of negotiation and resistance by several members, stipulated that some privacy guarantees remain. A single copy of the documents would be available for each of the 11 member states to be used "on the premises of an appropriate archival repository." Each government was expected to take into account "the sensitivity of certain information" the files may contain, the new agreement said. In addition to the United States, and France indicated they also would seek copies. The seven countries that have ratified the treaty amendments are the United States, Israel, Poland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Britain. Endorsement was awaited from Luxembourg, Greece, Italy and France.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070514/sc_nm/sleep_light_dc	Mars experiment might help Earthling insomniacs - Yahoo! News Mars experiment might help Earthling insomniacs By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor Mon May 14, 6:15 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An experiment aimed at finding ways to help astronauts adapt to life on Mars could end up helping insomniacs on Earth, researchers said on Monday. They found that two 45-minute exposures to bright light in the evening could help people adjust to a longer, Martian-style day. During the experiment, they found a wider-than-expected variation in an internal system the human body uses to keep track of days and nights, and they believe their treatment might help people with certain disorders of this system. "The results have powerful implications for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including shift work disorder and advanced sleep phase disorder," said Dr. Charles Czeisler, chief of the Division of Sleep Medicine at Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital and Harvard medical school in Boston. The U.S. space agency had asked Czeisler&#39;s lab to find ways to help astronauts adjust to life on Mars, where the days are about 24 hours and 39 minutes long, or 24.65 hours. This nearly 25-hour day is enough to throw most people into a state of jet lag, which Czeisler has shown interferes with the ability to learn, remember things, react quickly and to sleep. His team tested 12 healthy volunteers aged 22 to 33 who had kept a regular eight-hour sleep and 16-hour wakeful schedule at home for at least three weeks. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences National Academy of Sciences , they said the natural range of circadian days in just their group was from 23.47 hours to 24.48 hour days -- a full hour&#39;s difference. Tests on animals has shown there is a natural variation. Daylight tweaks the genetically determined circadian rhythm. "In virtually all cases, the exposure that we get to light ... keeps us in sync with the 24-hour day," Czeisler said in a telephone interview. But what "astounded" Czeisler was an additional difference in hormone release. They took blood from these volunteers every hour and found those people with the shorter internal clock released the sleep hormone melatonin four to five hours before their usual bedtimes, while those with unusually long internal days did not release melatonin until about an hour before bedtime. Other research has shown that using a computer after dark, working in a brightly lit office or other exposure to bright light can mess up a person&#39;s internal clock, making it harder to fall asleep. So Czeisler&#39;s team tested the volunteers in a similar way, using two 45-minute exposures to bright light for 30 days. The volunteers successfully adjusted to the Martian-length day, Czeisler said. This could mean that light therapy might help people whose insomnia is caused by having a long- or shorter-than-normal internal body clock, Czeisler said.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070514/ap_on_en_ot/mr__pop_culture	Syracuse prof is pop culture ambassador - Yahoo! News Syracuse prof is pop culture ambassador By JOCELYN NOVECK, AP National Writer Mon May 14, 3:33 PM ET SYRACUSE, N.Y. - Last week was pretty slow in the world of pop culture news. But the media sought out Robert Thompson just the same. The Syracuse University professor was quoted on the image of motherhood on TV. On the phenomenon of animal shows on cable. The danger of Hollywood trilogies. 's future. The hipness of being a nerd. Such exposure is nothing unusual for Thompson, a font of pop culture knowledge like few others. There may well be an expert somewhere who has a more wide-ranging, obsessive knowledge of this highly amorphous subject. But if so, they're keeping quiet about it. And it would be hard for the amiable, 47-year-old Thompson to keep quiet at this point, even if he wanted to. Because reporters from all over the world would keep calling &#151; to get his witty analysis of Katie Couric's debut on CBS, of vintage furniture, of the growth of barbecue culture. He's been called, half-jokingly, the most quoted man in America. That's not exactly true; we do have a president. But on certain days, when the pop culture firmament is busy, well, just Google his name. "I've seen Bob get 60, 70, 80 media calls in one day," says the man who hired him at Syracuse, David Rubin, dean of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. "I've seen him in a hallway on his cell phone for hours. You could go so far as to say Bob is the most quoted academic in the United States." So often has Thompson been quoted, over 17 years at Syracuse, that some news organizations (including The Associated Press) have lately tried consciously NOT to quote him. But nobody said we couldn't write ABOUT him. So while Syracuse, the seat of Onondaga County, about 250 miles from New York City, would hardly seem a mecca of pop culture, it seems a worthwhile journey to meet one of the only men on the planet capable of riffing rhapsodically, on cue, about the history of the aluminum lawn chair. The first thing you notice in Thompson's office are the TV sets. Not because three in one office is so unusual &#151; though this office does seem rather spacious for an academic, not to mention the view &#151; but because of what's playing. Not CNN or Fox News, but an episode of "The Show" on TV Land. TV is Thompson's passion; his office shelves are lined with old VHS tapes filled with countless hours of shows. A short walk away is the lecture hall where he teaches his spring undergraduate class. On this, the last day of the semester, Thompson has three hours to wrap up the history of television. He whips into action, starting with the early '50s and Lucy and Desi. Before you can say "Hill Street Blues" he's up to the '80s &#151; the second "Golden Age" of television &#151; by way of "Quincy" and "Barnaby Jones." At the turn of the century, Thompson argues, television is at its all-time best, with HBO the crown jewel. "The Larry Sanders Show." "Oz." "Sex and the City." "The Sopranos." "Rome." And so on. He turns to reality TV, which, in a typically sweeping yet concise Thompson-ism, he calls "the most interesting new way to tell a story since the invention of the novel." It began in Britain, he explains, and then "the virus jumped over the Atlantic and spread." "Survivor" is dissected. So is "Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?" and "Temptation Island." Have you ever noticed how conservative "The Bachelor" is, he muses, with all these girls waiting for a kiss? Stephanie from South Carolina has recently been rejected by bachelor Andy, he notes. Yes, he does watch all this stuff. Now he broaches the "single biggest event in all of TV history" &#151; coverage of the 9/11 terror attacks. He plays a good hour of CNN from that awful morning, reminding the students, most of whom were about 14 then, how it felt to watch the twin towers collapse on live TV. When he later plays segments of an MTV documentary on pop culture post-9/11, no one flinches when one of its featured commentators turns out to be Thompson. The students are used to it. The class ends with society's current fixation on YouTube, the wildly popular video-sharing site. And one lesson from that, he notes, is how our collective attention span has shrunk. We can't watch a YouTube clip that's more than a few minutes long. To prove it, he plays a tedious clip of someone's pet cat playing the piano. "Seven minutes," another Thompson-ism goes, "is the new 'War and Peace.'" Back in his office later that evening, Thompson explains the genesis of his interest in pop culture. He did his undergraduate work at the University of Chicago, where he initially planned to be an art history professor. But on Sunday nights, when the dorms didn't serve food, he would eat takeout in front of the TV. He found that he chose "CHiPs," with , over PBS, and became fascinated with the question: "Why do smart people watch dumb TV?" He did his thesis on Dante's "Divine Comedy," but came to believe that "art could be something that came out of a TV set." That led to a broader interest in popular culture. "I realized that to understand TV you needed to understand the network radio era. And vaudeville. And the circus. And comic strips. Every year I would binge on something." He did his masters and doctorate at Northwestern, and arrived in 1990 at Syracuse, where he now heads the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture. Over the years, reaction from traditional academics to his chosen field has become much less hostile, he says. "Now, there isn't a university that doesn't have a course on the history of rock 'n' roll," he notes. Thompson, who's written or edited six books of his own, gets up each day at five to read; he consumes three new books a week, not to mention uncounted hours of TV. (He also has a family that he spends time with.) He's constantly becoming enamored with new areas of pop culture. A couple years ago, for example, he realized he didn't know enough about Shakespeare &#151; a pop culture figure of his time, after all. He decided to watch all existing plays on VHS or DVD. In three months he watched 113 plays and read 25 books on the bard. "I was crazed," he says contentedly. Then there's his interest in the webbed aluminum lawn chair. "They're really taken for granted," he says. He's happy to explain how the phenomenon began with extra metal from wartime scrap drives, combined with explosive growth in America's suburbs. Right now, Thompson's focusing his pop-culture lens on ancient times. "I'm interested in the celebrity culture of ancient Rome," he says. "Back then, as now, it was who you knew that got you into parties." It dovetails with a broader Thompson thesis: So many things that we think are new, really aren't. "American Idol," you say? Nothing new, he replies. Remember Ted Mack's "Original Amateur Hour?" It's not just the breadth of Thompson's interests that make him so quotable. It's his accessibility &#151; he returns phone calls promptly &#151; and the un-academic way he speaks: in snappy sentences that are easy to digest. "I don't speak in clauses," he acknowledges. "I believe in periods." Some might actually say he speaks in soundbites &#151; the media gossip site Jossip.com has in fact drily called him "Mr. Soundbite," and Thompson himself notes he's been called a "quote whore." But reporters point out that he thinks hard to come up with something different and interesting. "Unlike many people in his position, he almost always finds an angle or perspective that I hadn't thought about," says AP Television Writer David Bauder. Angela Nelson, a professor at Bowling Green State University, says Thompson is "performing a great service for the discipline. Television in particular has been seen to be trivial, and his paying attention to it and preserving it is good for the culture." Nelson is the head of her university's Popular Culture department &#151; the only full department in the country devoted to the subject, established in the 1970s. (Most pop culture courses are nestled in other departments like English, communications, or sociology.) Thompson has been quoted so often, at least one reporter has told him of a "moratorium" at their newspaper on quoting him. One can see why editors would notice. At The New York Times alone, an archive search shows Thompson quoted more than 40 times in the last four years, by writers in a wide range of areas. At the AP, he's been quoted close to 20 times in the past year. "These days, answers are so predictable, crafted and cliche," says journalism teacher , of the Poynter Institute in Florida. "Somebody who thinks on their feet, relies on a well of knowledge and is curious about the world at large can be an invaluable resource." Clark, who notes he's unfamiliar with Thompson, adds: "As long as it doesn't turn journalists into lazybones." Thompson says he's weary of the most-quoted-guy label, but Rubin, his dean, says: "Bob is very proud of his status. He's just got a certain modesty about him." He adds that Thompson is not at all hierarchical: If a school paper calls before a major news organization, they'll get the return call first. As a teacher, Thompson is said to be generous with his time, though he's known as a tough grader &#151; something that can disappoint a student hoping to get an easy ride in a pop culture class. "He really has a lot of time for his students," says Carolyn Davis, a doctoral student in media studies who assisted Thompson this semester. "People will come in just to talk, and he'll order lunch." In any case, the university loves his star status. "My job is to keep Bob happy," says Rubin. Thompson says he learns from the give-and-take with the media. Besides, it's a teacher's job to preach what he knows &#151; and Thompson feels Americans need a basic working knowledge of their own pop culture. "To understand the history of this nation," he says, leaving you with one last Thompson-ism, "you have to understand its presidents and its wars. "But you also need to understand its lawn ornaments and its cheeseburgers."

"To understand the history of this nation," he says, leaving you with one last Thompson-ism, "you have to understand its presidents and its wars.

News Little Mermaid statue vandalized Tue May 15, 10:44 AM ET COPENHAGEN, Denmark - Copenhagen's famed Little Mermaid statue was covered with paint by vandals, the second time it has been defaced since March. Tourists flocked to the landmark Tuesday to take snapshots of the bronze statue, whose face, left arm and lap had been doused with red paint. A wooden picture frame sat next to the statue, with the word "AV" &#151; Danish for "ouch" &#151; written in green. Police said they did not know who had defaced the statue, or whether it was connected to overnight clashes between riot police and rock-throwing youths near Copenhagen's hippie district Christiania. The Little Mermaid was created by Danish sculptor Edvard Eriksen in tribute to Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen. Sitting on a rock at the entrance of the Copenhagen harbor since 1913, she draws an estimated 1 million visitors a year, and has become a popular target for vandals. Four years ago, the statue was blown off her perch by culprits who used explosives. She has been beheaded and doused in paint several times. On March 3, vandals covered the statue with pink paint, which was quickly removed by a cleanup crew with soap and high-pressure water cleaners.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_bi_ge/tyco_settlement	Tyco paying &#36;3 billion to settle lawsuit - Yahoo! News Tyco paying &#36;3 billion to settle lawsuit By KATHARINE WEBSTER, Associated Press Writer CONCORD, N.H. - Tyco International Ltd. has agreed to pay about $3 billion to settle shareholder claims from one of the largest corporate fraud cases ever, ending uncertainty over the outcome of the legal battle as it prepares to split into three companies. Tyco said Tuesday it would set up a $2.975 billion cash fund to pay claims filed by shareholders against the company arising from actions by ex-chief executive L. Dennis Kozlowski and other top officers convicted of looting the company and inflating its value. Tyco said it would take a charge of that amount during the current quarter. Tyco spokesman Paul Fitzhenry said the company also would pay interest on the $2.975 billion and turn over half of any money it recovers from ongoing lawsuits against Kozlowski, former Chief Operating Officer Mark Swartz and former board member Frank Walsh. "With this settlement, we are taking an important step to resolve our most significant remaining legacy legal matter," Chairman and Chief Executive Ed Breen said in a statement. "Our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong and will allow us to readily absorb these costs while removing much of the uncertainty around legacy legal matters." Investors, including union and state pension funds and Tyco retirees, were permitted last summer to proceed with a consolidated class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in New Hampshire, where Tyco was formerly headquartered. The settlement still must be approved by the largest shareholders and the court. The settlement covers shareholders from December 1999 to June 2002 and, in some of the consolidated cases, investors who owned stock starting in October 1998, the company said. Tyco's share price rose 19 cents to $32.38 Tuesday. Tyco is breaking up into three publicly traded companies: Tyco Healthcare, which will be renamed Covidien and based in Mansfield, Mass.; Tyco Electronics, to be based in Berwyn, Pa., near Philadelphia; and Tyco International, which will remain in New Jersey and include the fire and security and engineered products units. The breakup has been delayed twice, but is now slated for the end of June. Lawyers for the shareholders said the settlement would top $3 billion with interest, making it the largest payout ever by a single corporate defendant in a securities fraud lawsuit. "This is a fantastic resolution and closes a chapter on one of the largest and most appalling examples of corporate fraud in U.S. history," said Jay Eisenhofer, managing partner at Grant & Eisenhofer. Total settlements involving securities fraud lawsuits against Enron Corp. ($7.1 billion) and WorldCom Inc. ($6.1 billion) were larger, but those companies are now bankrupt and the payments were made primarily by outside co-defendants including investment banks and auditors. Cendant Corp. agreed to settle a shareholder lawsuit for $2.83 billion in December 1999. "This is a settlement of historic proportions for the investors who suffered significant financial losses and it also sends a strong message to those who would engage in this type of misconduct in the future," said Richard Schiffrin, of Schiffrin, Barroway, Topaz & Kessler. Shareholder claims against the company's former auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are still pending, so the total amount recovered by shareholders could be larger, Eisenhofer said. Tyco also has agreed to assign its claims against PricewaterhouseCoopers to the shareholders, who will pursue them "vigorously" alongside the shareholders' existing claims, Eisenhofer said. "The fraud couldn't have taken place without them. They totally abdicated their responsibility as independent auditor, and had they performed as they should have, this fraud wouldn't have taken place," he said. PricewaterhouseCoopers spokesman David Nestor declined to comment. The portion of the settlement that will go toward attorneys' fees has not been determined yet, Eisenhofer said. Kozlowski and Swartz were convicted in a New York State court in 2005 of multiple counts of grand larceny, conspiracy, securities fraud and falsifying business records. Prosecutors said the two conspired to defraud Tyco of $600 million to fund their extravagant lifestyles. They were sentenced in September 2006 to eight to 25 years in prison. A judge refused to release them on bail while they appeal. The shareholders' lawsuits alleged the company misrepresented the value of Tyco and companies it acquired under Kozlowski's leadership in a giant accounting fraud scheme, causing losses estimated at $1 billion to $2 billion. Tyco makes everything from telecommunications equipment to home alarm systems. The company, which is registered in Bermuda, was run from Exeter, N.H., at the time of the alleged fraud.

News Pollution turning Taj Mahal yellow Tue May 15, 6:47 AM ET NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pollution is turning the Taj Mahal yellow, despite efforts by the government to control air contamination around the poignant 17th century monument and keep it shimmering white, a parliamentary committee has said. In a report to parliament this week, the standing committee on transport, tourism and culture said airborne particles were being deposited on the monument&#39;s white marble, giving it a yellow tinge. The monument, in the city of Agra about four hours drive south of the capital, was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Authorities have made various attempts in the past to keep the area around the Taj Mahal pollution free, including setting up an air pollution monitoring station in Agra. But the committee said that while air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide gases were generally within permissible limits, "suspended particulate matter" had been recorded at high levels except during the rainy season. It suggested a clay pack treatment that is non-corrosive and non-abrasive be carried out to remove deposits on the marble. "The committee recommends that while undertaking any conservation activity at the Taj Mahal, abundant cautions should be taken to retain the original glory of the shimmering white marble used in this." Attracting around 20,000 visitors every day, the monument was completed in 1648 after 17 years of construction by 20,000 workers.

Four years ago, the statue was blown off her perch by culprits who used explosives. She has been beheaded and doused in paint several times. On March 3, vandals covered the statue with pink paint, which was quickly removed by a cleanup crew with soap and high-pressure water cleaners.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070514/ap_on_re_us/baby_psychiatry	Doctors look for early autism signs - Yahoo! News Doctors look for early autism signs By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer Mon May 14, 2:14 PM ET CHICAGO - Within days of their birth, healthy babies will look you in the eye. By 4 months, they will delight in others. And by 9 months, they will exchange smiles. Jacob Day did none of those things. "We used to say it was like it burned his eyes to look at you," said his mother, Tamie Day of Antelope, Calif. "It was like a physically painful thing for him. It wasn't just that he wasn't looking at us; he was purposefully looking away." Day, who has a psychology degree, suspected her son might have autism. She enrolled him in a study, published in April, that found that babies like Jacob are indeed at high risk for autism if they do not respond to their names by 12 months of age. At 18 months, he was formally diagnosed with autism, about a year earlier than usual. Before he turned 2, Jacob began daily intensive behavior treatment designed to help him lead a more normal life. He is part of a growing field in psychiatry called infant mental health. Doctors and scientists are increasingly looking for early signs in babies of autism, attention deficit disorder and other mental problems that just a generation ago, scarcely anyone thought could appear in children so young. Some scientists even believe that intensive treatment in some susceptible babies can actually prevent autism, attention deficit disorder and other problems. An influential Institute of Medicine report in 2000 helped energize this idea. The report emphasized the plasticity of babies' brains. It also explained how interacting with babies can change their brain wiring. "We used to say `nature versus nurture,' but now people really think it's 'nature through nurture,'" said the University of Chicago's Dr. Lawrence Gray. Tamie Day noticed the first ominous clue the night she and her husband, Chris, brought Jacob home after his birth. "We walked in the door and he wouldn't stop looking at our ceiling fan," she said. "The next day, that's all he would look at." Babies typically begin making eye contact soon after birth, and "understand at a basic, perhaps hardwired level, that eyes are special &#151; they look more at eyes than at other parts of the face," said Sally Ozonoff, an autism specialist at the University of California at Davis' MIND Institute. When his mother expressed her autism concerns at Jacob's 6-month checkup, the doctor said "we were being a little overzealous," Day said. Still, there was no pointing, no clapping, no shared smiles, and when Jacob would laugh, it seemed like his own private joke. So his parents sought out UC-Davis specialists, who gave them the heartbreaking diagnosis. Jacob, now 3 1/2, has made meaningful progress thanks to treatment, his mother said, including a breakthrough moment at age 2. It still makes her cry to recall it. She was giving Jacob a bath, playing the "itsy bitsy spider" finger game, when he looked up and really gazed into her eyes. "He was smiling up at me and I realized that was the first time he had done that," she said. "He has gorgeous blue eyes, and I was like, `My God, your eyes are so beautiful.'" Interest in infant mental health has been boosted by awareness of the prevalence of attention deficit disorders and autism, which government officials said in February affects 1 in 150 U.S. children and may be more common than previously thought. In April, researchers from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Interdisciplinary Council on Developmental and Learning Disorders presented a report emphasizing earlier diagnosis and treatment. The report said that about 17 percent of U.S. children have a developmental disability such as autism, mental retardation and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, but that fewer than half are diagnosed before starting school. The authors say warning signs include failure to: _focus on sights and sounds by 2 months. _initiate joyful behavior with parents by 4 months. _exchange smiles and sounds with parents by 8 to 9 months. _take a parent's hand to find a toy and point to objects by 12 to 16 months. Last year, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that pediatricians routinely evaluate children for developmental problems such as autism starting in infancy, and begin testing at age 9 months. "Waiting until a young child misses a major milestone such as walking or talking may result in late rather than early recognition ... depriving the child and family of the benefits of early identification and intervention," the academy said. Some critics worry that the trend will trigger needless diagnoses in children with normal variations in behavior. Dr. Michael Fitzpatrick, a London physician, said that while early recognition and treatment of true disorders are important, "the extension of these categories to include 20 to 30 percent of all children reflects a social trend of pathologizing and medicalizing children's lives, which seems to reflect difficulties of parents and teachers in dealing with familiar problems of childhood development." Dr. Stanley Greenspan, a psychiatry professor at George Washington University who co-authored the -Interdisciplinary group report, said the idea is not to slap a label on babies and give them medication. Greenspan said the goal is to raise awareness about early warning signs and to encourage treatment to increase the chances that children can develop normally. Research on identifying early clues and testing treatments is booming. For example: _Dr. Fred Volkmar at Yale University is studying potential ways to diagnose autism in the first months of life, including whether looking at objects rather than people is a sign. "I think we're on the verge of being able to do a much better job" of diagnosing autism in infancy, Volkmar said. _Researcher Stephen Porges at the University of Illinois at Chicago is starting a five-year study of whether excessive crying past 6 months of age might be an early sign of autism, attention deficit or other behavior problems. _Greenspan is launching a multimillion-dollar study involving parents and babies at risk for autism or attention deficit disorder. One group will receive intensive behavior training, the other will not; both will be compared through age 5. While rigorous scientific evidence is needed to prove that early intervention succeeds, Greenspan said his work with patients has shown promise. Jacob didn't say his first word, "more," until he was in treatment and almost 2 &#151; about a year later than normal. He didn't say "mama" until he was 3. He gets 33 hours of weekly home treatment with trained college students, including six hours most days. The tab is $70,000 yearly, paid for by California, one of the few states that pay, through state and federal funds, for early intensive autism treatment. Jacob's sessions involve lots of repetition, and rewards, including praise and treats, for a job well done. For example, to improve eye contact, teachers bounce him on a favorite giant ball, then stop. If he turns to look at them, he gets praise, maybe a piece of candy, and more bouncing. To teach language, they use activities like swinging that get him excited enough to make sounds, then offer rewards for sounds like vowels or consonants rather than humming. Then they name objects, encourage mimicking, and offer more rewards. Now he knows the alphabet, understands commands like "Bring me the cow and the horse toy," and can say simple sentences like "I want juice," his mother said. "We definitely hope to mainstream him. We hope that he will have a job and have a life where he can take care of himself and be happy," Day said. "Everyone has given us reason to believe that's not an outlandish expectation."

News Doctors look for early autism signs By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer Mon May 14, 2:14 PM ET CHICAGO - Within days of their birth, healthy babies will look you in the eye. By 4 months, they will delight in others. And by 9 months, they will exchange smiles. Jacob Day did none of those things. "We used to say it was like it burned his eyes to look at you," said his mother, Tamie Day of Antelope, Calif. "It was like a physically painful thing for him. It wasn't just that he wasn't looking at us; he was purposefully looking away." Day, who has a psychology degree, suspected her son might have autism. She enrolled him in a study, published in April, that found that babies like Jacob are indeed at high risk for autism if they do not respond to their names by 12 months of age. At 18 months, he was formally diagnosed with autism, about a year earlier than usual. Before he turned 2, Jacob began daily intensive behavior treatment designed to help him lead a more normal life. He is part of a growing field in psychiatry called infant mental health. Doctors and scientists are increasingly looking for early signs in babies of autism, attention deficit disorder and other mental problems that just a generation ago, scarcely anyone thought could appear in children so young. Some scientists even believe that intensive treatment in some susceptible babies can actually prevent autism, attention deficit disorder and other problems. An influential Institute of Medicine report in 2000 helped energize this idea. The report emphasized the plasticity of babies' brains. It also explained how interacting with babies can change their brain wiring. "We used to say `nature versus nurture,' but now people really think it's 'nature through nurture,'" said the University of Chicago's Dr. Lawrence Gray. Tamie Day noticed the first ominous clue the night she and her husband, Chris, brought Jacob home after his birth. "We walked in the door and he wouldn't stop looking at our ceiling fan," she said. "The next day, that's all he would look at." Babies typically begin making eye contact soon after birth, and "understand at a basic, perhaps hardwired level, that eyes are special &#151; they look more at eyes than at other parts of the face," said Sally Ozonoff, an autism specialist at the University of California at Davis' MIND Institute. When his mother expressed her autism concerns at Jacob's 6-month checkup, the doctor said "we were being a little overzealous," Day said. Still, there was no pointing, no clapping, no shared smiles, and when Jacob would laugh, it seemed like his own private joke. So his parents sought out UC-Davis specialists, who gave them the heartbreaking diagnosis. Jacob, now 3 1/2, has made meaningful progress thanks to treatment, his mother said, including a breakthrough moment at age 2. It still makes her cry to recall it. She was giving Jacob a bath, playing the "itsy bitsy spider" finger game, when he looked up and really gazed into her eyes. "He was smiling up at me and I realized that was the first time he had done that," she said. "He has gorgeous blue eyes, and I was like, `My God, your eyes are so beautiful.'" Interest in infant mental health has been boosted by awareness of the prevalence of attention deficit disorders and autism, which government officials said in February affects 1 in 150 U.S. children and may be more common than previously thought. In April, researchers from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Interdisciplinary Council on Developmental and Learning Disorders presented a report emphasizing earlier diagnosis and treatment. The report said that about 17 percent of U.S. children have a developmental disability such as autism, mental retardation and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, but that fewer than half are diagnosed before starting school. The authors say warning signs include failure to: _focus on sights and sounds by 2 months. _initiate joyful behavior with parents by 4 months. _exchange smiles and sounds with parents by 8 to 9 months. _take a parent's hand to find a toy and point to objects by 12 to 16 months. Last year, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that pediatricians routinely evaluate children for developmental problems such as autism starting in infancy, and begin testing at age 9 months. "Waiting until a young child misses a major milestone such as walking or talking may result in late rather than early recognition ... depriving the child and family of the benefits of early identification and intervention," the academy said. Some critics worry that the trend will trigger needless diagnoses in children with normal variations in behavior. Dr. Michael Fitzpatrick, a London physician, said that while early recognition and treatment of true disorders are important, "the extension of these categories to include 20 to 30 percent of all children reflects a social trend of pathologizing and medicalizing children's lives, which seems to reflect difficulties of parents and teachers in dealing with familiar problems of childhood development." Dr. Stanley Greenspan, a psychiatry professor at George Washington University who co-authored the -Interdisciplinary group report, said the idea is not to slap a label on babies and give them medication. Greenspan said the goal is to raise awareness about early warning signs and to encourage treatment to increase the chances that children can develop normally. Research on identifying early clues and testing treatments is booming. For example: _Dr. Fred Volkmar at Yale University is studying potential ways to diagnose autism in the first months of life, including whether looking at objects rather than people is a sign. "I think we're on the verge of being able to do a much better job" of diagnosing autism in infancy, Volkmar said. _Researcher Stephen Porges at the University of Illinois at Chicago is starting a five-year study of whether excessive crying past 6 months of age might be an early sign of autism, attention deficit or other behavior problems. _Greenspan is launching a multimillion-dollar study involving parents and babies at risk for autism or attention deficit disorder. One group will receive intensive behavior training, the other will not; both will be compared through age 5. While rigorous scientific evidence is needed to prove that early intervention succeeds, Greenspan said his work with patients has shown promise. Jacob didn't say his first word, "more," until he was in treatment and almost 2 &#151; about a year later than normal. He didn't say "mama" until he was 3. He gets 33 hours of weekly home treatment with trained college students, including six hours most days. The tab is $70,000 yearly, paid for by California, one of the few states that pay, through state and federal funds, for early intensive autism treatment. Jacob's sessions involve lots of repetition, and rewards, including praise and treats, for a job well done. For example, to improve eye contact, teachers bounce him on a favorite giant ball, then stop. If he turns to look at them, he gets praise, maybe a piece of candy, and more bouncing. To teach language, they use activities like swinging that get him excited enough to make sounds, then offer rewards for sounds like vowels or consonants rather than humming. Then they name objects, encourage mimicking, and offer more rewards. Now he knows the alphabet, understands commands like "Bring me the cow and the horse toy," and can say simple sentences like "I want juice," his mother said. "We definitely hope to mainstream him. We hope that he will have a job and have a life where he can take care of himself and be happy," Day said. "Everyone has given us reason to believe that's not an outlandish expectation."

Interest in infant mental health has been boosted by awareness of the prevalence of attention deficit disorders and autism, which government officials said in February affects 1 in 150 U.S. children and may be more common than previously thought. In April, researchers from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Interdisciplinary Council on Developmental and Learning Disorders presented a report emphasizing earlier diagnosis and treatment. The report said that about 17 percent of U.S. children have a developmental disability such as autism, mental retardation and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, but that fewer than half are diagnosed before starting school. The authors say warning signs include failure to: _focus on sights and sounds by 2 months. _initiate joyful behavior with parents by 4 months. _exchange smiles and sounds with parents by 8 to 9 months. _take a parent's hand to find a toy and point to objects by 12 to 16 months. Last year, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that pediatricians routinely evaluate children for developmental problems such as autism starting in infancy, and begin testing at age 9 months. "Waiting until a young child misses a major milestone such as walking or talking may result in late rather than early recognition ... depriving the child and family of the benefits of early identification and intervention," the academy said. Some critics worry that the trend will trigger needless diagnoses in children with normal variations in behavior. Dr. Michael Fitzpatrick, a London physician, said that while early recognition and treatment of true disorders are important, "the extension of these categories to include 20 to 30 percent of all children reflects a social trend of pathologizing and medicalizing children's lives, which seems to reflect difficulties of parents and teachers in dealing with familiar problems of childhood development." Dr. Stanley Greenspan, a psychiatry professor at George Washington University who co-authored the -Interdisciplinary group report, said the idea is not to slap a label on babies and give them medication. Greenspan said the goal is to raise awareness about early warning signs and to encourage treatment to increase the chances that children can develop normally. Research on identifying early clues and testing treatments is booming. For example: _Dr. Fred Volkmar at Yale University is studying potential ways to diagnose autism in the first months of life, including whether looking at objects rather than people is a sign. "I think we're on the verge of being able to do a much better job" of diagnosing autism in infancy, Volkmar said. _Researcher Stephen Porges at the University of Illinois at Chicago is starting a five-year study of whether excessive crying past 6 months of age might be an early sign of autism, attention deficit or other behavior problems. _Greenspan is launching a multimillion-dollar study involving parents and babies at risk for autism or attention deficit disorder. One group will receive intensive behavior training, the other will not; both will be compared through age 5. While rigorous scientific evidence is needed to prove that early intervention succeeds, Greenspan said his work with patients has shown promise. Jacob didn't say his first word, "more," until he was in treatment and almost 2 &#151; about a year later than normal. He didn't say "mama" until he was 3. He gets 33 hours of weekly home treatment with trained college students, including six hours most days. The tab is $70,000 yearly, paid for by California, one of the few states that pay, through state and federal funds, for early intensive autism treatment. Jacob's sessions involve lots of repetition, and rewards, including praise and treats, for a job well done. For example, to improve eye contact, teachers bounce him on a favorite giant ball, then stop. If he turns to look at them, he gets praise, maybe a piece of candy, and more bouncing. To teach language, they use activities like swinging that get him excited enough to make sounds, then offer rewards for sounds like vowels or consonants rather than humming. Then they name objects, encourage mimicking, and offer more rewards. Now he knows the alphabet, understands commands like "Bring me the cow and the horse toy," and can say simple sentences like "I want juice," his mother said. "We definitely hope to mainstream him. We hope that he will have a job and have a life where he can take care of himself and be happy," Day said. "Everyone has given us reason to believe that's not an outlandish expectation."

But it is the biggest yet to suggest high-dose multivitamins may harm the prostate, and the latest chapter in the confusing quest to tell whether taking various vitamins really helps a variety of conditions &#151; or is a waste of money, or worse. Government scientists turned to a study tracking the diet and health of almost 300,000 men. About a third reported taking a daily multivitamin, and 5 percent were heavy users, swallowing the pills more than seven times a week. Within five years of the study's start, 10,241 men had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Some 1,476 had advanced cancer; 179 died. Heavy multivitamin users were almost twice as likely to get fatal prostate cancer as men who never took the pills, concludes the study in Wednesday's Journal of the Here's the twist: Overall, the researchers found no link between multivitamin use and early-stage prostate cancer. The researchers speculate that perhaps high-dose vitamins had little effect until a tumor appeared, and then could spur its growth. While similar but smaller studies have suggested a link, too, more rigorous research is needed, caution the National Cancer Institute scientists. This newest study involves men who voluntarily took vitamins, and those most at risk &#151; perhaps because they had a family history of the disease &#151; may have been more likely to take the pills in hopes of avoiding their fate.

News U.S. healthcare expensive, inefficient: report By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor Tue May 15, 1:25 AM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans get the poorest health care and yet pay the most compared to five other rich countries, according to a report released on Tuesday. Germany, Britain, Australia and Canada all provide better care for less money, the Commonwealth Fund report found. "The U.S. health care system ranks last compared with five other nations on measures of quality, access, efficiency, equity, and outcomes," the non-profit group which studies health care issues said in a statement. Canada rates second worst out of the five overall. Germany scored highest, followed by Britain, Australia and New Zealand. "The United States is not getting value for the money that is spent on health care," Commonwealth Fund president Karen Davis said in a telephone interview. The group has consistently found that the United States, the only one of the six nations that does not provide universal health care, scores more poorly than the others on many measures of health care. President George W. Bush President George W. Bush , many employers and insurers have all agreed in recent months to overhaul the U.S. health care system -- an uncoordinated conglomeration of employer-funded care, private health insurance and government programs. The current system leaves about 45 million people with no insurance at all, according to U.S. government estimates from 2005, and many studies have shown most of these people do not receive preventive services that not only keep them healthier, but reduce long-term costs. Davis said the fund&#39;s researchers looked at hard data for the report. "It is pretty indisputable that we spend twice what other countries spend on average," she said. Per capita health spending in the United States in 2004 was &#36;6,102, twice that of Germany, which spent &#36;3,005. Canada spent &#36;3,165, New Zealand &#36;2,083 and Australia &#36;2,876, while Britain spent &#36;2,546 per person. "We focus primarily on measures that are sensitive to medical care making a difference -- infant mortality and healthy lives at age 60," Davis said. "Those are pretty key measures, like how long you live and whether you are going to die before age 75." Measures of other aspects of care such as cataract surgery or hip replacements is harder to come by, she said. They also looked at convenience and again found the United States lacking -- with a few exceptions. "We include measures such as waiting more than four months for elective, non-emergency surgery. The United States doesn&#39;t do as well as Germany but it does a lot better than the other countries on waiting time for surgery," Davis said. "We looked at the time it takes to get in to see your own doctor ... (or) once you go to the emergency room do you sit there for more than two hours, and truthfully, we don&#39;t do well on those measures," Davis said. According to the report, 61 percent of U.S. patients said it was somewhat or very difficult to get care on nights or weekends, compared with 25 percent to 59 percent in other countries. "The area where the U.S. health care system performs best is preventive care, an area that has been monitored closely for over a decade by managed care plans," the report reads. The United States had the fewest patients -- 84 percent -- reporting that they have a regular doctor. And U.S. doctors are the least wired, with the lowest percentage using electronic medical records or receiving electronic updates on recommended treatments.

The current system leaves about 45 million people with no insurance at all, according to U.S. government estimates from 2005, and many studies have shown most of these people do not receive preventive services that not only keep them healthier, but reduce long-term costs. Davis said the fund&#39;s researchers looked at hard data for the report. "It is pretty indisputable that we spend twice what other countries spend on average," she said. Per capita health spending in the United States in 2004 was &#36;6,102, twice that of Germany, which spent &#36;3,005. Canada spent &#36;3,165, New Zealand &#36;2,083 and Australia &#36;2,876, while Britain spent &#36;2,546 per person. "We focus primarily on measures that are sensitive to medical care making a difference -- infant mortality and healthy lives at age 60," Davis said. "Those are pretty key measures, like how long you live and whether you are going to die before age 75." Measures of other aspects of care such as cataract surgery or hip replacements is harder to come by, she said. They also looked at convenience and again found the United States lacking -- with a few exceptions. "We include measures such as waiting more than four months for elective, non-emergency surgery. The United States doesn&#39;t do as well as Germany but it does a lot better than the other countries on waiting time for surgery," Davis said. "We looked at the time it takes to get in to see your own doctor ... (or) once you go to the emergency room do you sit there for more than two hours, and truthfully, we don&#39;t do well on those measures," Davis said. According to the report, 61 percent of U.S. patients said it was somewhat or very difficult to get care on nights or weekends, compared with 25 percent to 59 percent in other countries. "The area where the U.S. health care system performs best is preventive care, an area that has been monitored closely for over a decade by managed care plans," the report reads. The United States had the fewest patients -- 84 percent -- reporting that they have a regular doctor. And U.S. doctors are the least wired, with the lowest percentage using electronic medical records or receiving electronic updates on recommended treatments.

News Stallone pleads guilty to import charges By MERAIAH FOLEY, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 2:08 AM ET SYDNEY, Australia - Actor Sylvester Stallone pleaded guilty Tuesday to bringing vials of restricted muscle-building hormones into Australia and faces sentencing next week. Lawyers for the 60-year-old star of the "Rocky" and "Rambo" movies entered the guilty pleas on behalf of the actor, who did not appear before Sydney's Downing Center Local Court. "I made a terrible mistake, not because I was attempting to deceive anyone but I was simply ignorant to your official rules," Stallone said in a letter to Sydney's Local Court. "I feel terrible that my breach of the rules has set a poor example to members of the public, whose opinion I cherish dearly." Stallone was accused of bringing banned substances into Australia after a customs search of his luggage during a Feb. 16 visit to Sydney revealed 48 vials of the human growth hormone product, Jintropin. Three days later, Stallone threw four vials of the male hormone testosterone from his Sydney hotel room when customs officials arrived to search it, prosecutor David Agius told the court. Human growth hormone, a naturally occurring substance that can be replicated synthetically and is used to build muscle mass, is considered a performance enhancing drug in Australia and it cannot be imported without a permit from the national drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration. The maximum penalty for bringing Jintropin into Australia illegally is a fine of $91,500 and five years in prison, but Stallone faces a maximum penalty of just $18,000 on each of the two charges because the matter is being heard by a local, not federal, court. Deputy Chief Magistrate Paul Cloran said Stallone would be sentenced on Monday next week. Stallone's lawyer Phillip Boulten said the actor should be spared a criminal conviction, saying Stallone took the hormones for medical reasons that he did not specify. "The defendant, Sylvester Stallone, is extremely mortified about having been involved in this incident," Boulten told the court. "Had he known that what he was doing was contrary to Australian law, he almost certainly would not have done it." But Agius said Stallone had demonstrated a "consciousness of guilt" by throwing the testosterone from the hotel. Boulten said Stallone was taking both substances under medical supervision. "This is not some back-alley body builder dealing covertly with some banned substance in some sort of secret way," he said. "This was a legitimate medical condition being treated by doctors of the top ranking order in the west coast of the United States." Agius told Cloran that Stallone was to have appeared in the court through a video link but that that plan had been abandoned. Agius did not elaborate. Prosecution documents handed to the court in March said Stallone had marked "No" on a customs declaration card that asked if he was bringing into Australia restricted or prohibited goods "such as medicines, steroids, firearms, weapons, or any kind of illicit drugs." During his visit to Australia, Stallone shrugged off the airport incident. "It was just a minor misunderstanding," Stallone told reporters "They were just doing their jobs. I just didn't understand some of the rules here." He came to Australia on a three-day tour to promote the latest movie in the "Rocky" series, "Rocky Balboa." A media throng was kept waiting for hours outside Sydney International Airport for the actor and his entourage. When a tightlipped Stallone emerged, he signed his autograph for several fans but avoided media questions about the delay.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/faked_attack	School workers suspended in fake attack - Yahoo! News School workers suspended in fake attack Mon May 14, 11:14 PM ET MURFREESBORO, Tenn. - Two school employees who staged a fake gun attack on a group of students during a field trip have been suspended, school officials said Monday. During the last night of a weeklong trip to a state park, staff members convinced 69 sixth-grade students from Scales Elementary School that there was a gunman on the loose. One official has said the exercise was intended as a teaching tool. The students were told to lie on the floor or hide underneath tables and stay quiet. After the lights went out, some of the children began to cry. A teacher, disguised in a hooded sweat shirt, pulled on locked doors. Teacher Quentin Mastin and assistant principal Don Bartch were suspended for unprofessional conduct and neglect of duty because of the staged attack, schools director Marilyn Mathis said Monday. Calls to the district offices were not answered after hours Monday. A call to Bartch's home went unanswered Monday night, and a listing for Mastin could not be found. The suspension is without pay and lasts until the end of the school year on June 1, The Daily News Journal of Murfreesboro reported. "This was not a good experience," said Alisha Graves, whose son went on the trip. "Those kids were crying, and they were terrified." Some parents said they were upset by the staff's poor judgment in light of the April 16 shootings at Virginia Tech that left 33 people dead, including the gunman. Bartch, who was present, has said the scenario was intended as a learning experience and lasted only five minutes. "We got together and discussed what we would have done in a real situation," he said. (This version CORRECTS the teacher's last name to Mastin, instead of Masters.)

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070515/us_nm/usa_falwell_dc	Evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 - Yahoo! News Evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 2 hours, 6 minutes ago WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. evangelist Jerry Falwell, a leader of the religious right who battled in the political arena against abortion and homosexuality, died on Tuesday at age 73. Falwell, who founded the Moral Majority as a conservative political force in 1979, was found unconscious in his office at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, and was taken to a nearby hospital. He had a history of congestive heart problems. Falwell had no heartbeat when he was found by colleagues at around 11:30 a.m., Dr. Carl Moore, his personal physician, said. He could not be resuscitated and was pronounced dead just over an hour later, Moore told a news conference. Falwell was one of the most prominent figures in the religious right, a powerful movement that seeks to redraw public policy in the United States along evangelical Christian lines. Fond of quipping that the Bible referred to "Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve," Falwell provoked a storm of protest when he said gays, lesbians and health workers who provide abortions were partly to blame for the September 11 attacks. "I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians ... all of them who have tried to secularize America, I point the finger in their face and say: you helped this happen," he said. For decades, Falwell had been an influential conservative voice in politics. Falwell founded the Thomas Road Baptist Church in his hometown of Lynchburg in 1956. He went on to found Liberty University in 1971 -- a conservative center of higher learning -- and in 1979 started the Moral Majority organization, which became a major vehicle for getting out the vote for the Republican Party.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070515/us_nm/usa_falwell_dc	Evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 - Yahoo! News Evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 2 hours, 6 minutes ago WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. evangelist Jerry Falwell, a leader of the religious right who battled in the political arena against abortion and homosexuality, died on Tuesday at age 73. Falwell, who founded the Moral Majority as a conservative political force in 1979, was found unconscious in his office at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, and was taken to a nearby hospital. He had a history of congestive heart problems. Falwell had no heartbeat when he was found by colleagues at around 11:30 a.m., Dr. Carl Moore, his personal physician, said. He could not be resuscitated and was pronounced dead just over an hour later, Moore told a news conference. Falwell was one of the most prominent figures in the religious right, a powerful movement that seeks to redraw public policy in the United States along evangelical Christian lines. Fond of quipping that the Bible referred to "Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve," Falwell provoked a storm of protest when he said gays, lesbians and health workers who provide abortions were partly to blame for the September 11 attacks. "I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians ... all of them who have tried to secularize America, I point the finger in their face and say: you helped this happen," he said. For decades, Falwell had been an influential conservative voice in politics. Falwell founded the Thomas Road Baptist Church in his hometown of Lynchburg in 1956. He went on to found Liberty University in 1971 -- a conservative center of higher learning -- and in 1979 started the Moral Majority organization, which became a major vehicle for getting out the vote for the Republican Party. He disbanded the Moral Majority in 1989 but it was resurrected as The Moral Majority Coalition, with an explicit political purpose, after President George W. Bush President George W.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_he_me/vitamins_prostate	Study links vitamin use, prostate cancer - Yahoo! News Study links vitamin use, prostate cancer WASHINGTON - There's more worrisome news about vitamins: Taking too many may increase men's risk of dying from prostate cancer. The study, being published Wednesday, doesn't settle the issue. But it is the biggest yet to suggest high-dose multivitamins may harm the prostate, and the latest chapter in the confusing quest to tell whether taking various vitamins really helps a variety of conditions &#151; or is a waste of money, or worse. Government scientists turned to a study tracking the diet and health of almost 300,000 men. About a third reported taking a daily multivitamin, and 5 percent were heavy users, swallowing the pills more than seven times a week. Within five years of the study's start, 10,241 men had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Some 1,476 had advanced cancer; 179 died. Heavy multivitamin users were almost twice as likely to get fatal prostate cancer as men who never took the pills, concludes the study in Wednesday's Journal of the Here's the twist: Overall, the researchers found no link between multivitamin use and early-stage prostate cancer. The researchers speculate that perhaps high-dose vitamins had little effect until a tumor appeared, and then could spur its growth. While similar but smaller studies have suggested a link, too, more rigorous research is needed, caution the National Cancer Institute scientists. This newest study involves men who voluntarily took vitamins, and those most at risk &#151; perhaps because they had a family history of the disease &#151; may have been more likely to take the pills in hopes of avoiding their fate. Still, "the findings lend further credence to the possibility of harm associated with increased use of supplements," Dr. Christian Gluud of Copenhagen University Hospital and Dr. Goran Bjelakovic of Serbia's University of Nis wrote in an accompanying editorial.

News Wis. festival sells deep-fried testicles Sun May 13, 2:56 PM ET ELDERON, Wis. - Around here, it may be tough to pass up anything deep-fried. Wisconsinites have deep-fried cheese curds, candy bars and Twinkies. They now have deep-fried livestock testicles, too. More than 300 people paid $5 for all-you-can-eat goat, lamb and bull testicles Saturday at the ninth annual Testicle Festival at Mama's Place Bar and Grill in Elderon in central Wisconsin. "Once you get over the mental (aspect) of what you're eating, it's just like eating any other food, and it tastes good," Buster Hoffman said. Festival founder Nancy Fenske said the festival grew out of her late husband Roger's birthday party 12 years ago. They decided to have "a nut fry" at Mama's Place after bringing back lamb fries from a trip to Montana. The event grew every year and now they fry up to 100 pounds of testicles, she said. "What else can you do in a small town?" Fenske said. Butch Joubert, 58, likes the parts sandwiched between bread with tartar sauce. They're not so different from regular meatballs also served at the festival, he said. "After a few beers, you can't really tell the difference," Joubert said.

News Miami holds top spot on rude driver list By SARAH LARIMER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 9:07 AM ET MIAMI - For the second straight year, rude Miami drivers have earned the city the title of worst road rage in a survey released Tuesday. Miami motorists said they saw other drivers slam on their brakes, run red lights and talk on cell phones, according to AutoVantage, a Connecticut-based automobile membership club offering travel services and roadside assistance. Other cities near the top of the rude drivers list were New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. South Miami resident Erik Pinto told The Associated Press he's probably seen every bad driving habit on Miami's roads. "You don't want to know what I've seen," Pinto said. "I've seen everything. I'm from L.A., and we don't see the crazy drivers that you see here." Portland, Ore., drivers were the least likely of the cities to see other motorists tailgating on the roadways, and St. Louis motorists were the least likely to swear at another driver, the survey found. Minneapolis-St. Paul was rated the most courteous city in 2006 but slipped to the middle of the list this year. The most frequent cause of road rage cited in the survey was impatient motorists. Drivers also cited poor driving in fast lanes and driving while stressed, frustrated or angry. "The best piece of advice is to take a deep breath. Slow down, be aware and be careful," AutoVantage spokesman Todd Smith said, adding the aim of the survey is to increase driver safety across the nation. More than 2,500 drivers who regularly commute in 25 major metropolitan areas were asked to rate road rage and rude driving in telephone surveys between January and March. The survey was conducted by Prince Market Research has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

News Iraq a "terrorist Disneyland" if U.S. goes: expert By Mark Trevelyan, Security Correspondent Tue May 15, 10:54 AM ET LONDON (Reuters) - A U.S. troop pullout from would leave the country as a potent launchpad for international terrorism and Washington would be forced to go back in within a couple of years, a leading al Qaeda expert said on Tuesday. Rohan Gunaratna told a security conference at Lloyd&#39;s of London insurance market that Iraq, like in the 1990s, would become a "terrorist Disneyland" where al Qaeda could build up its strength unchallenged. If U.S., British and other coalition troops withdrew from Iraq in the next year, he said, "certainly the scale of attacks that would be mounted inside Iraq, and using Iraq as a launching pad to strike other Western countries -- countries in Europe, North America - would become such that after two or three years, the U.S. forces will have to go back to Iraq." The Singapore-based academic and writer said the epicenter of international terrorism had already switched from Afghanistan to Iraq. "In many ways, the terrorist threat has now shifted 1,500 miles closer to Europe." President George W. Bush President George W. Bush is locked in a standoff with a Democratic-led Congress over funding for the war in Iraq, now in its fifth year, in which more than 3,400 American troops have been killed. Democrats are pushing for a time frame for withdrawal, something the White House opposes as sending the wrong message to U.S. forces, allies and enemies alike. Some Republicans are also questioning the war more publicly. Britain, the leading U.S. partner in Iraq, is scaling back its troops there, although the idea of an immediate pullout was rejected this week by Gordon Brown, the man expected to succeed Bush&#39;s close ally as prime minister next month. Addressing the same conference, a top British security official acknowledged home-grown Islamist militants had exploited the British troop presence in Afghanistan and Iraq for propaganda purposes. But the official, Sir Richard Mottram, said any decision on withdrawal should be taken based on its impact on the two countries, not its effect on the views of radicals in Britain. "I&#39;d be very cautious about withdrawing from Afghanistan in circumstances where the field was left to the Taliban," said Mottram, Permanent Secretary for Intelligence, Security and Resilience at the Cabinet Office. He declined comment on Iraq. A former head of Britain&#39;s foreign intelligence service MI6 described Gunaratna&#39;s analysis as convincing. "Clearly al Qaeda are focusing on Iraq now, and focusing on some sort of propaganda victory over the United States," Sir Richard Dearlove told reporters. "Whether that&#39;s an actual victory or not, if they can claim in the Muslim world that they&#39;ve done well, then that puts us in a very difficult position. This is really an aspect of withdrawal that hasn&#39;t been properly considered. That&#39;s why I think we can&#39;t just let Iraq go its own way."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070515/us_nm/usa_falwell_dc	Evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 - Yahoo! News Evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 Tue May 15, 3:24 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. evangelist Jerry Falwell, a leader of the religious right who battled in the political arena against abortion and homosexuality, died on Tuesday at age 73. Falwell, who founded the Moral Majority as a conservative political force in 1979, was found unconscious in his office at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, and was taken to a nearby hospital. He had a history of congestive heart problems. Falwell had no heartbeat when he was found by colleagues at around 11:30 a.m., Dr. Carl Moore, his personal physician, said. He could not be resuscitated and was pronounced dead just over an hour later, Moore told a news conference. Falwell was one of the most prominent figures in the religious right, a powerful movement that seeks to redraw public policy in the United States along evangelical Christian lines. Fond of quipping that the Bible referred to "Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve," Falwell provoked a storm of protest when he said gays, lesbians and health workers who provide abortions were partly to blame for the September 11 attacks. "I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians ... all of them who have tried to secularize America, I point the finger in their face and say: you helped this happen," he said. For decades, Falwell had been an influential conservative voice in politics. Falwell founded the Thomas Road Baptist Church in his hometown of Lynchburg in 1956. He went on to found Liberty University in 1971 -- a conservative center of higher learning -- and in 1979 started the Moral Majority organization, which became a major vehicle for getting out the vote for the Republican Party. He disbanded the Moral Majority in 1989 but it was resurrected as The Moral Majority Coalition, with an explicit political purpose, after President George W. Bush President George W. Bush &#39;s re-election in 2004. Full Coverage: Rev.

News Wis. festival sells deep-fried testicles Sun May 13, 2:56 PM ET ELDERON, Wis. - Around here, it may be tough to pass up anything deep-fried. Wisconsinites have deep-fried cheese curds, candy bars and Twinkies. They now have deep-fried livestock testicles, too. More than 300 people paid $5 for all-you-can-eat goat, lamb and bull testicles Saturday at the ninth annual Testicle Festival at Mama's Place Bar and Grill in Elderon in central Wisconsin. "Once you get over the mental (aspect) of what you're eating, it's just like eating any other food, and it tastes good," Buster Hoffman said. Festival founder Nancy Fenske said the festival grew out of her late husband Roger's birthday party 12 years ago. They decided to have "a nut fry" at Mama's Place after bringing back lamb fries from a trip to Montana. The event grew every year and now they fry up to 100 pounds of testicles, she said. "What else can you do in a small town?" Fenske said. Butch Joubert, 58, likes the parts sandwiched between bread with tartar sauce. They're not so different from regular meatballs also served at the festival, he said. "After a few beers, you can't really tell the difference," Joubert said.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/road_rage	Miami holds top spot on rude driver list - Yahoo! News Miami holds top spot on rude driver list By SARAH LARIMER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 9:07 AM ET MIAMI - For the second straight year, rude Miami drivers have earned the city the title of worst road rage in a survey released Tuesday. Miami motorists said they saw other drivers slam on their brakes, run red lights and talk on cell phones, according to AutoVantage, a Connecticut-based automobile membership club offering travel services and roadside assistance. Other cities near the top of the rude drivers list were New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. South Miami resident Erik Pinto told The Associated Press he's probably seen every bad driving habit on Miami's roads. "You don't want to know what I've seen," Pinto said. "I've seen everything. I'm from L.A., and we don't see the crazy drivers that you see here." Portland, Ore., drivers were the least likely of the cities to see other motorists tailgating on the roadways, and St. Louis motorists were the least likely to swear at another driver, the survey found. Minneapolis-St. Paul was rated the most courteous city in 2006 but slipped to the middle of the list this year. The most frequent cause of road rage cited in the survey was impatient motorists. Drivers also cited poor driving in fast lanes and driving while stressed, frustrated or angry. "The best piece of advice is to take a deep breath. Slow down, be aware and be careful," AutoVantage spokesman Todd Smith said, adding the aim of the survey is to increase driver safety across the nation. More than 2,500 drivers who regularly commute in 25 major metropolitan areas were asked to rate road rage and rude driving in telephone surveys between January and March. The survey was conducted by Prince Market Research has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

The corpse, preserved by salty air in the seaside town of Roses after an apparent death by natural causes, was discovered by Jorge Giro, who entered the house for the first time on Saturday after buying it at the auction, El Pais said. The dead woman, described by neighbors as having been in poor health and often absent visiting relatives in Madrid, had stopped paying her mortgage six years ago. The unnamed bank which eventually repossessed the home never bothered to look inside before selling it.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20070515/sc_livescience/humanancestorhadapeabrain	Human Ancestor Had a Pea Brain - Yahoo! News Human Ancestor Had a Pea Brain Mon May 14, 8:15 PM ET Higher primates such as humans are considered the brainiacs of the mammalian world. But a 29-million-year-old fossilized skull suggests that one of our remote ancestors was a bit of a &ldquo;pea brain,&rdquo; sporting a noggin smaller than that of a modern lemur. The skull belonged to a common ancestor of humans, monkeys and apes. "This means the big-brained monkeys and apes developed their large brains at a later point in time,&rdquo; said lead study author Elwyn Simons, a Duke University primatologist. Until now, scientists had assumed brain size was a key feature that defined higher primates, a category that includes humans, . The larger brain relative to body size also has provided paleoanthropologists with a physical marker for the evolutionary distinction between higher and lower primates, which include lemurs of Madagascar. Tiny enough to fit into the palm of your hand, the skull comes from a female Aegyptopithecus zeuxis, which means &ldquo;linking Egyptian ape.&rdquo; This lived about 33 million years ago, a time when primates were evolving rapidly. The cat-size primate ate fruits and leaves in a tropical rainforest in what is now the Fayum in Egypt. The discovery, published online this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences National Academy of Sciences , sheds light on the evolution of &ldquo;The reason Aegyptopithecus is so important is that it&rsquo;s at the base of the family tree of the Old World higher primates, the group that we&rsquo;re in,&rdquo; Simons told LiveScience. &ldquo;So this is telling us something about the chapter in our own ancestry.&rdquo; Simons and his team dug up the skull in 2004 from a quarry called the Jebel Qatrani Formation in Egypt. The cranium was so well preserved the team used micro computed-tomography (CT) scanning, which relies on X-rays, to recreate the inside of the skull and calculate dimensions of the brain it once encased. He had found a similar, but fragmented skull at the site in 1966. Comparing dimensions of the old and new skull suggests the 1996 specimen belonged to a male, while the new skull was that of a female. The size of the female skull suggests it &ldquo;had a brain that might have been even smaller than that of a modern lemur&#39;s," Simons said. The new skull also suggests the species had a much smaller brain than was previously estimated based on the 1996 skull. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little surprising to find out that the brain volume on this thing indicates that maybe the New and Old World monkeys, their common ancestor had a prosimian-, or lower-primate-like brain like Aegyptopithecus does,&rdquo; Simons said. The team estimates the female weighed about five and a half pounds, or half the weight of the male. This size difference between males and females, called &ldquo;sexual dimorphism,&rdquo; is comparable to that in gorillas, whose genes make them our second-closest relatives next to The stark size difference indicates the monkey-like animals were social and hung out in multi-male and multi-female troops of 15 to 20 individuals. &ldquo;If we infer that an Aegyptopithecus had a large social group, that suggests it had enough sense to tell all of those members apart from nonmembers,&rdquo; Simons said. "But other features in these skulls, and in many other Aegyptopithecus fossil pieces collected at the Egyptian site over four decades, suggest that this primate was already branching away from its lemur-like ancestry," he said. Other features also point to an . The skull shows features similar to other higher primates, including a developed visual cortex, suggesting Aegyptopithecus had acute vision. "So the visual sense, which is regarded as a very important feature of anthropoids, or higher primates, had already expanded,&rdquo; Simons said. And unlike the prosimians, which run around at night, the animal had small eye sockets and was likely diurnal (awake during daylight) like modern and ancient higher primates.

News Two New York radio hosts fired for Asian slur Mon May 14, 11:52 PM ET NEW YORK (AFP) - The CBS network has fired two "shock jocks" over an on-air slur against Asians, US media reported Monday, weeks after another radio host was sacked for making a racist remark. The hosts of "The Dog House with JV and Elvis," Jeff Vandergrift and Dan Lay, had been suspended earlier as the broadcaster decided their fate. The show was permanently canceled after the two placed an on-air order to a Chinese restaurant for "slimp flied lice" and compared food items to certain parts of the body on April 5. "&#39;The Dog House with JV and Elvis&#39; will no longer be broadcast," CBS Radio spokeswoman Karen Mateo told the New York Daily News. After the prank call was broadcast, the Organization of Chinese Americans, an advocacy group, had blasted the network and demanded CBS fire the hosts. The move came after Don Imus, who had enjoyed a large national audience for his radio and television program, was fired after he called the Rutgers university women&#39;s basketball team "nappy-headed ho&#39;s," nappy referring to the tight hair of many African-Americans and ho, as street talk for "whore." "In the wake of the Imus case, it would have been maddening to the community if these idiots did not get fired," Queens City Councilman John Liu told the New York daily.

News Iraq a "terrorist Disneyland" if U.S. goes: expert By Mark Trevelyan, Security Correspondent Tue May 15, 10:54 AM ET LONDON (Reuters) - A U.S. troop pullout from would leave the country as a potent launchpad for international terrorism and Washington would be forced to go back in within a couple of years, a leading al Qaeda expert said on Tuesday. Rohan Gunaratna told a security conference at Lloyd&#39;s of London insurance market that Iraq, like in the 1990s, would become a "terrorist Disneyland" where al Qaeda could build up its strength unchallenged. If U.S., British and other coalition troops withdrew from Iraq in the next year, he said, "certainly the scale of attacks that would be mounted inside Iraq, and using Iraq as a launching pad to strike other Western countries -- countries in Europe, North America - would become such that after two or three years, the U.S. forces will have to go back to Iraq." The Singapore-based academic and writer said the epicenter of international terrorism had already switched from Afghanistan to Iraq. "In many ways, the terrorist threat has now shifted 1,500 miles closer to Europe." President George W. Bush President George W. Bush is locked in a standoff with a Democratic-led Congress over funding for the war in Iraq, now in its fifth year, in which more than 3,400 American troops have been killed. Democrats are pushing for a time frame for withdrawal, something the White House opposes as sending the wrong message to U.S. forces, allies and enemies alike. Some Republicans are also questioning the war more publicly. Britain, the leading U.S. partner in Iraq, is scaling back its troops there, although the idea of an immediate pullout was rejected this week by Gordon Brown, the man expected to succeed Bush&#39;s close ally as prime minister next month. Addressing the same conference, a top British security official acknowledged home-grown Islamist militants had exploited the British troop presence in Afghanistan and Iraq for propaganda purposes. But the official, Sir Richard Mottram, said any decision on withdrawal should be taken based on its impact on the two countries, not its effect on the views of radicals in Britain. "I&#39;d be very cautious about withdrawing from Afghanistan in circumstances where the field was left to the Taliban," said Mottram, Permanent Secretary for Intelligence, Security and Resilience at the Cabinet Office. He declined comment on Iraq. A former head of Britain&#39;s foreign intelligence service MI6 described Gunaratna&#39;s analysis as convincing. "Clearly al Qaeda are focusing on Iraq now, and focusing on some sort of propaganda victory over the United States," Sir Richard Dearlove told reporters. "Whether that&#39;s an actual victory or not, if they can claim in the Muslim world that they&#39;ve done well, then that puts us in a very difficult position. This is really an aspect of withdrawal that hasn&#39;t been properly considered. That&#39;s why I think we can&#39;t just let Iraq go its own way."

News TV evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 By SUE LINDSEY, Associated Press Writer LYNCHBURG, Va. - The Rev. Jerry Falwell was stricken at his campus office and died Tuesday after a career in which the evangelist used the power of television to transform the religious right into a mighty force in American politics. He was 73. The founder of the Moral Majority was discovered without a pulse at Liberty University and pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later. Dr. Carl Moore, Falwell's physician, said he had a heart condition and presumably died of a heart rhythm abnormality. Driven into politics by the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that established the right to an abortion, Falwell founded the Moral Majority in 1979. One of the conservative lobbying group's greatest triumphs came just a year later, when Falwell credited the Moral Majority with getting millions of conservative voters registered, aiding in Reagan's victory and giving Republicans control of the Senate. "I shudder to think where the country would be right now if the religious right had not evolved," he said when he stepped down as Moral Majority president in 1987. Fellow TV evangelist Pat Robertson, himself a one-time GOP candidate for president, declared Falwell "a tower of strength on many of the moral issues which have confronted our nation." The rise of Christian conservatism &#151; and the Moral Majority's full-throated condemnation of homosexuality, abortion and pornography &#151; made Falwell perhaps the most recognizable figure on the evangelical right, and one of the most controversial ones, too. Over the years, Falwell waged a landmark libel case against Hustler magazine founder Larry Flynt over a raunchy parody ad, and created a furor in 1999 when one of his publications suggested that the purse-carrying "Teletubbies" character Tinky Winky was gay. Matt Foreman, executive director of National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, extended condolences to those close to Falwell, but added: "Unfortunately, we will always remember him as a founder and leader of America's anti-gay industry, someone who exacerbated the nation's appalling response to the onslaught of the epidemic, someone who demonized and vilified us for political gain and someone who used religion to divide rather than unite our nation." The 1980s marked the religious conservative movement's high-water mark. In more recent years, Falwell had become a problematic figure for the GOP. His remarks a few days after Sept. 11, 2001, essentially blaming feminists, gays and liberals for bringing on the terrorist attacks drew a rebuke from the White House, and he apologized. Falwell's declining political star seemed apparent when he was quietly led in and out of the Republican Party's 2004 national convention. Just four years earlier, he was invited to pray from the rostrum. The big, blue-eyed preacher with a booming voice started a fundamentalist church in an abandoned bottling plant in Lynchburg in 1956 with just 35 members. He built it into a religious empire that included the 24,000-member Thomas Road Baptist Church, the "Old Time Gospel Hour" carried on TV stations around the country and 9,600-student Liberty University, which Falwell founded in 1971 as Lynchburg Baptist College. From his living room, he broadcast his message of salvation and raised the donations that helped his ministry grow. "He was one of the first to come up with ways to use television to expand his ministry," said Robert Alley, a retired University of Richmond religion professor who studied and criticized Falwell's career. Alley died last summer. Falwell had once opposed mixing preaching with politics, but changed his views. The Moral Majority grew to 6.5 million members and raised $69 million as it supported conservative politicians and railed against abortion, homosexuality, pornography and bans on school prayer. Falwell became the face of the religious right, appearing on national magazine covers and on talk shows. In 1983, U.S. News & World Report named him one of 25 most influential people in America. "Jerry's passions and convictions changed the course of our country for the better over the last 20 years," said James Dobson, founder of the conservative Christian Focus on the Family ministry. "It was Jerry who led an entire wing of Christianity, the fundamentalist wing, away from isolation and into a direct confrontation with the culture." "Dr. Falwell was a man of distinguished accomplishment who devoted his life to serving his faith and country," said Sen. John McCain ( ), a GOP presidential contender who during the 2000 primaries referred to Falwell and Robertson as "agents of intolerance." McCain has since distanced himself from those comments. In 1984, Falwell sued Hustler for $45 million, charging that he was libeled by an liquor-ad parody that quoted him as saying he lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse. A federal jury found the fake ad did not libel him, but awarded him $200,000 for emotional distress. The verdict was overturned in a landmark 1988 decision that held that even pornographic spoofs about a public figure enjoy First Amendment protection. With Falwell's high profile came frequent criticism, even from fellow ministers. The Rev. Billy Graham once rebuked him for political sermonizing on "non-moral issues." Falwell quit the Moral Majority in 1987, saying he was tired of being "a lightning rod" and wanted to devote his time to his ministry and Liberty University. But he remained outspoken and continued to draw criticism for his remarks. In 1999, he told an evangelical conference that the Antichrist was a male Jew who was probably already alive. Falwell later apologized for the remark but not for holding the belief. A month later, his National Liberty Journal warned parents that Tinky Winky, the children's TV character, was a gay role model and morally damaging to children. Falwell was re-energized after family values proved important in the 2004 presidential election. He formed the Faith and Values Coalition as the "21st Century resurrection of the Moral Majority," to seek anti-abortion judges, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and more conservative elected officials. In 1987, Falwell took over the PTL (Praise the Lord) ministry in South Carolina after the Rev. Jim Bakker got caught in a sex and money scandal. Falwell slid fully clothed down a theme park water slide after donors met his fundraising goal to help rescue the rival ministry. He gave it up seven months later after learning the depth of PTL's financial problems. Largely because of the sex scandals involving Bakker and fellow evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, donations to Falwell's ministry dropped from $135 million in 1986 to less than $100 million the following year. Hundreds of workers were laid off and viewers of his television show dwindled. Liberty University was $73 million in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy, and his "Old Time Gospel Hour" was $16 million in debt. By the mid-1990s, two local businessmen with long ties to Falwell began overseeing the finances and helped get companies to forgive debts or write them off. Falwell dreamed that Liberty would grow to 50,000 students and be to fundamentalist Christians what Notre Dame is to Roman Catholics and Brigham Young University is to Mormons. Falwell's father and his grandfather were militant atheists, he wrote in his autobiography. He said his father made a fortune off his businesses &#151; including bootlegging during Prohibition. As a student, Falwell was a star athlete and a prankster who was barred from giving his high school valedictorian's speech after he was caught using counterfeit lunch tickets. He ran with a gang of juvenile delinquents before becoming a born-again Christian at 19. He turned down an offer to play professional baseball and transferred from Lynchburg College to Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Mo. "My heart was burning to serve Christ," he once said in an interview. "I knew nothing would ever be the same again." Falwell had made careful preparations for a transition of his leadership to his two sons, Jerry Falwell, Jr., now vice chancellor of Liberty University, and Jonathan Falwell, executive the pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church. Falwell is survived by his wife, Macel, his two sons and a daughter, Jeannie Falwell Savas. Funeral arrangements were not immediately known. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Mormon whose own faith has become an issue during his run for the presidency, said Falwell "built and led a movement based on strong principles and strong faith," and "the legacy of his important work will continue through his many ministries where he put his faith into action."

News French workers biggest whiners, Irish happiest: study Mon May 14, 10:31 AM ET LONDON (AFP) - French workers are the world&#39;s biggest whiners, according to a study published Monday which said the Irish complain least about their lot. Britons come second to their Gallic cousins in the moaning stakes, followed by Sweden, the United States and Australia. Japanese workers have the lowest morale, but don&#39;t complain so much. The lowest levels of whining were found in the Netherlands, Thailand and Ireland, according to the study by the FDS research group. "It is interesting to note that after France, Britain and Sweden, the world&#39;s biggest workplace whingers are Americans, despite their having by far the highest levels of income," said FDS chief Charlotte Cornish. "Compare them to Thai workers: while real levels of income are more than eight times higher in the States, more workers in the US feel their pay is a problem than in Thailand," she added. The study, entitled "What Workers Want, A Worldwide Study of Attitudes to Work and Work-Life Balance", draws on data from 14,000 employees in 23 countries. They were notably asked about their satisfaction with issues including pay levels and their work-life balance, as well as average working hours. In terms of worker morale, Dutch workers are the happiest, followed by their Thai and Irish counterparts. The lowest morale of all is found in Japan, followed by Germany, said the study. The study&#39;s authors noted that rightwing French President-elect Nicolas Sarkozy shouldn&#39;t expect things to become happier anytime soon, as he prepares to shake up notoriously strike-prone France. "The UK and US, with their marked competitive individualism and unequal wealth distribution, both appear towards the top of the world&#39;s list of whingiest workers," said Cornish. "The French come out on top -- it seems unlikely that Nicolas Sarkozy&#39;s election and the likely shift to more Anglo-Saxon economic practices will make the workers in France any more happy with their lot," she added.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070515/us_nm/healthcare_usa_dc	U.S. healthcare expensive, inefficient: report - Yahoo! News U.S. healthcare expensive, inefficient: report By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor Tue May 15, 1:25 AM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans get the poorest health care and yet pay the most compared to five other rich countries, according to a report released on Tuesday. Germany, Britain, Australia and Canada all provide better care for less money, the Commonwealth Fund report found. "The U.S. health care system ranks last compared with five other nations on measures of quality, access, efficiency, equity, and outcomes," the non-profit group which studies health care issues said in a statement. Canada rates second worst out of the five overall. Germany scored highest, followed by Britain, Australia and New Zealand. "The United States is not getting value for the money that is spent on health care," Commonwealth Fund president Karen Davis said in a telephone interview. The group has consistently found that the United States, the only one of the six nations that does not provide universal health care, scores more poorly than the others on many measures of health care. President George W. Bush President George W. Bush , many employers and insurers have all agreed in recent months to overhaul the U.S. health care system -- an uncoordinated conglomeration of employer-funded care, private health insurance and government programs. The current system leaves about 45 million people with no insurance at all, according to U.S. government estimates from 2005, and many studies have shown most of these people do not receive preventive services that not only keep them healthier, but reduce long-term costs. Davis said the fund&#39;s researchers looked at hard data for the report. "It is pretty indisputable that we spend twice what other countries spend on average," she said. Per capita health spending in the United States in 2004 was &#36;6,102, twice that of Germany, which spent &#36;3,005. Canada spent &#36;3,165, New Zealand &#36;2,083 and Australia &#36;2,876, while Britain spent &#36;2,546 per person. "We focus primarily on measures that are sensitive to medical care making a difference -- infant mortality and healthy lives at age 60," Davis said. "Those are pretty key measures, like how long you live and whether you are going to die before age 75." Measures of other aspects of care such as cataract surgery or hip replacements is harder to come by, she said. They also looked at convenience and again found the United States lacking -- with a few exceptions. "We include measures such as waiting more than four months for elective, non-emergency surgery. The United States doesn&#39;t do as well as Germany but it does a lot better than the other countries on waiting time for surgery," Davis said. "We looked at the time it takes to get in to see your own doctor ... (or) once you go to the emergency room do you sit there for more than two hours, and truthfully, we don&#39;t do well on those measures," Davis said. According to the report, 61 percent of U.S. patients said it was somewhat or very difficult to get care on nights or weekends, compared with 25 percent to 59 percent in other countries. "The area where the U.S. health care system performs best is preventive care, an area that has been monitored closely for over a decade by managed care plans," the report reads. The United States had the fewest patients -- 84 percent -- reporting that they have a regular doctor. And U.S. doctors are the least wired, with the lowest percentage using electronic medical records or receiving electronic updates on recommended treatments.

News Mars experiment might help Earthling insomniacs By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor Mon May 14, 6:15 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An experiment aimed at finding ways to help astronauts adapt to life on Mars could end up helping insomniacs on Earth, researchers said on Monday. They found that two 45-minute exposures to bright light in the evening could help people adjust to a longer, Martian-style day. During the experiment, they found a wider-than-expected variation in an internal system the human body uses to keep track of days and nights, and they believe their treatment might help people with certain disorders of this system. "The results have powerful implications for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including shift work disorder and advanced sleep phase disorder," said Dr. Charles Czeisler, chief of the Division of Sleep Medicine at Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital and Harvard medical school in Boston. The U.S. space agency had asked Czeisler&#39;s lab to find ways to help astronauts adjust to life on Mars, where the days are about 24 hours and 39 minutes long, or 24.65 hours. This nearly 25-hour day is enough to throw most people into a state of jet lag, which Czeisler has shown interferes with the ability to learn, remember things, react quickly and to sleep. His team tested 12 healthy volunteers aged 22 to 33 who had kept a regular eight-hour sleep and 16-hour wakeful schedule at home for at least three weeks. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences National Academy of Sciences , they said the natural range of circadian days in just their group was from 23.47 hours to 24.48 hour days -- a full hour&#39;s difference. Tests on animals has shown there is a natural variation. Daylight tweaks the genetically determined circadian rhythm. "In virtually all cases, the exposure that we get to light ... keeps us in sync with the 24-hour day," Czeisler said in a telephone interview. But what "astounded" Czeisler was an additional difference in hormone release. They took blood from these volunteers every hour and found those people with the shorter internal clock released the sleep hormone melatonin four to five hours before their usual bedtimes, while those with unusually long internal days did not release melatonin until about an hour before bedtime. Other research has shown that using a computer after dark, working in a brightly lit office or other exposure to bright light can mess up a person&#39;s internal clock, making it harder to fall asleep. So Czeisler&#39;s team tested the volunteers in a similar way, using two 45-minute exposures to bright light for 30 days. The volunteers successfully adjusted to the Martian-length day, Czeisler said. This could mean that light therapy might help people whose insomnia is caused by having a long- or shorter-than-normal internal body clock, Czeisler said.

The corpse, preserved by salty air in the seaside town of Roses after an apparent death by natural causes, was discovered by Jorge Giro, who entered the house for the first time on Saturday after buying it at the auction, El Pais said. The dead woman, described by neighbors as having been in poor health and often absent visiting relatives in Madrid, had stopped paying her mortgage six years ago.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070514/ap_on_en_ot/mr__pop_culture	Syracuse prof is pop culture ambassador - Yahoo! News Syracuse prof is pop culture ambassador By JOCELYN NOVECK, AP National Writer Mon May 14, 3:33 PM ET SYRACUSE, N.Y. - Last week was pretty slow in the world of pop culture news. But the media sought out Robert Thompson just the same. The Syracuse University professor was quoted on the image of motherhood on TV. On the phenomenon of animal shows on cable. The danger of Hollywood trilogies. 's future. The hipness of being a nerd. Such exposure is nothing unusual for Thompson, a font of pop culture knowledge like few others. There may well be an expert somewhere who has a more wide-ranging, obsessive knowledge of this highly amorphous subject. But if so, they're keeping quiet about it. And it would be hard for the amiable, 47-year-old Thompson to keep quiet at this point, even if he wanted to. Because reporters from all over the world would keep calling &#151; to get his witty analysis of Katie Couric's debut on CBS, of vintage furniture, of the growth of barbecue culture. He's been called, half-jokingly, the most quoted man in America. That's not exactly true; we do have a president. But on certain days, when the pop culture firmament is busy, well, just Google his name. "I've seen Bob get 60, 70, 80 media calls in one day," says the man who hired him at Syracuse, David Rubin, dean of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. "I've seen him in a hallway on his cell phone for hours. You could go so far as to say Bob is the most quoted academic in the United States." So often has Thompson been quoted, over 17 years at Syracuse, that some news organizations (including The Associated Press) have lately tried consciously NOT to quote him. But nobody said we couldn't write ABOUT him. So while Syracuse, the seat of Onondaga County, about 250 miles from New York City, would hardly seem a mecca of pop culture, it seems a worthwhile journey to meet one of the only men on the planet capable of riffing rhapsodically, on cue, about the history of the aluminum lawn chair. The first thing you notice in Thompson's office are the TV sets. Not because three in one office is so unusual &#151; though this office does seem rather spacious for an academic, not to mention the view &#151; but because of what's playing. Not CNN or Fox News, but an episode of "The Show" on TV Land. TV is Thompson's passion; his office shelves are lined with old VHS tapes filled with countless hours of shows. A short walk away is the lecture hall where he teaches his spring undergraduate class. On this, the last day of the semester, Thompson has three hours to wrap up the history of television. He whips into action, starting with the early '50s and Lucy and Desi. Before you can say "Hill Street Blues" he's up to the '80s &#151; the second "Golden Age" of television &#151; by way of "Quincy" and "Barnaby Jones." At the turn of the century, Thompson argues, television is at its all-time best, with HBO the crown jewel. "The Larry Sanders Show." "Oz." "Sex and the City." "The Sopranos." "Rome." And so on. He turns to reality TV, which, in a typically sweeping yet concise Thompson-ism, he calls "the most interesting new way to tell a story since the invention of the novel." It began in Britain, he explains, and then "the virus jumped over the Atlantic and spread." "Survivor" is dissected. So is "Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?" and "Temptation Island." Have you ever noticed how conservative "The Bachelor" is, he muses, with all these girls waiting for a kiss? Stephanie from South Carolina has recently been rejected by bachelor Andy, he notes. Yes, he does watch all this stuff. Now he broaches the "single biggest event in all of TV history" &#151; coverage of the 9/11 terror attacks. He plays a good hour of CNN from that awful morning, reminding the students, most of whom were about 14 then, how it felt to watch the twin towers collapse on live TV. When he later plays segments of an MTV documentary on pop culture post-9/11, no one flinches when one of its featured commentators turns out to be Thompson. The students are used to it. The class ends with society's current fixation on YouTube, the wildly popular video-sharing site. And one lesson from that, he notes, is how our collective attention span has shrunk. We can't watch a YouTube clip that's more than a few minutes long. To prove it, he plays a tedious clip of someone's pet cat playing the piano. "Seven minutes," another Thompson-ism goes, "is the new 'War and Peace.'" Back in his office later that evening, Thompson explains the genesis of his interest in pop culture. He did his undergraduate work at the University of Chicago, where he initially planned to be an art history professor. But on Sunday nights, when the dorms didn't serve food, he would eat takeout in front of the TV. He found that he chose "CHiPs," with , over PBS, and became fascinated with the question: "Why do smart people watch dumb TV?" He did his thesis on Dante's "Divine Comedy," but came to believe that "art could be something that came out of a TV set." That led to a broader interest in popular culture. "I realized that to understand TV you needed to understand the network radio era. And vaudeville. And the circus. And comic strips. Every year I would binge on something." He did his masters and doctorate at Northwestern, and arrived in 1990 at Syracuse, where he now heads the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture. Over the years, reaction from traditional academics to his chosen field has become much less hostile, he says. "Now, there isn't a university that doesn't have a course on the history of rock 'n' roll," he notes. Thompson, who's written or edited six books of his own, gets up each day at five to read; he consumes three new books a week, not to mention uncounted hours of TV. (He also has a family that he spends time with.) He's constantly becoming enamored with new areas of pop culture. A couple years ago, for example, he realized he didn't know enough about Shakespeare &#151; a pop culture figure of his time, after all. He decided to watch all existing plays on VHS or DVD. In three months he watched 113 plays and read 25 books on the bard. "I was crazed," he says contentedly. Then there's his interest in the webbed aluminum lawn chair. "They're really taken for granted," he says. He's happy to explain how the phenomenon began with extra metal from wartime scrap drives, combined with explosive growth in America's suburbs. Right now, Thompson's focusing his pop-culture lens on ancient times. "I'm interested in the celebrity culture of ancient Rome," he says. "Back then, as now, it was who you knew that got you into parties." It dovetails with a broader Thompson thesis: So many things that we think are new, really aren't. "American Idol," you say? Nothing new, he replies. Remember Ted Mack's "Original Amateur Hour?" It's not just the breadth of Thompson's interests that make him so quotable. It's his accessibility &#151; he returns phone calls promptly &#151; and the un-academic way he speaks: in snappy sentences that are easy to digest. "I don't speak in clauses," he acknowledges. "I believe in periods." Some might actually say he speaks in soundbites &#151; the media gossip site Jossip.com has in fact drily called him "Mr. Soundbite," and Thompson himself notes he's been called a "quote whore." But reporters point out that he thinks hard to come up with something different and interesting. "Unlike many people in his position, he almost always finds an angle or perspective that I hadn't thought about," says AP Television Writer David Bauder. Angela Nelson, a professor at Bowling Green State University, says Thompson is "performing a great service for the discipline. Television in particular has been seen to be trivial, and his paying attention to it and preserving it is good for the culture." Nelson is the head of her university's Popular Culture department &#151; the only full department in the country devoted to the subject, established in the 1970s. (Most pop culture courses are nestled in other departments like English, communications, or sociology.) Thompson has been quoted so often, at least one reporter has told him of a "moratorium" at their newspaper on quoting him. One can see why editors would notice. At The New York Times alone, an archive search shows Thompson quoted more than 40 times in the last four years, by writers in a wide range of areas. At the AP, he's been quoted close to 20 times in the past year. "These days, answers are so predictable, crafted and cliche," says journalism teacher , of the Poynter Institute in Florida. "Somebody who thinks on their feet, relies on a well of knowledge and is curious about the world at large can be an invaluable resource." Clark, who notes he's unfamiliar with Thompson, adds: "As long as it doesn't turn journalists into lazybones." Thompson says he's weary of the most-quoted-guy label, but Rubin, his dean, says: "Bob is very proud of his status. He's just got a certain modesty about him." He adds that Thompson is not at all hierarchical: If a school paper calls before a major news organization, they'll get the return call first. As a teacher, Thompson is said to be generous with his time, though he's known as a tough grader &#151; something that can disappoint a student hoping to get an easy ride in a pop culture class. "He really has a lot of time for his students," says Carolyn Davis, a doctoral student in media studies who assisted Thompson this semester. "People will come in just to talk, and he'll order lunch." In any case, the university loves his star status. "My job is to keep Bob happy," says Rubin. Thompson says he learns from the give-and-take with the media. Besides, it's a teacher's job to preach what he knows &#151; and Thompson feels Americans need a basic working knowledge of their own pop culture. "To understand the history of this nation," he says, leaving you with one last Thompson-ism, "you have to understand its presidents and its wars. "But you also need to understand its lawn ornaments and its cheeseburgers."

News School workers suspended in fake attack Mon May 14, 11:14 PM ET MURFREESBORO, Tenn. - Two school employees who staged a fake gun attack on a group of students during a field trip have been suspended, school officials said Monday. During the last night of a weeklong trip to a state park, staff members convinced 69 sixth-grade students from Scales Elementary School that there was a gunman on the loose. One official has said the exercise was intended as a teaching tool. The students were told to lie on the floor or hide underneath tables and stay quiet. After the lights went out, some of the children began to cry. A teacher, disguised in a hooded sweat shirt, pulled on locked doors. Teacher Quentin Mastin and assistant principal Don Bartch were suspended for unprofessional conduct and neglect of duty because of the staged attack, schools director Marilyn Mathis said Monday. Calls to the district offices were not answered after hours Monday. A call to Bartch's home went unanswered Monday night, and a listing for Mastin could not be found. The suspension is without pay and lasts until the end of the school year on June 1, The Daily News Journal of Murfreesboro reported. "This was not a good experience," said Alisha Graves, whose son went on the trip. "Those kids were crying, and they were terrified." Some parents said they were upset by the staff's poor judgment in light of the April 16 shootings at Virginia Tech that left 33 people dead, including the gunman. Bartch, who was present, has said the scenario was intended as a learning experience and lasted only five minutes. "We got together and discussed what we would have done in a real situation," he said. (This version CORRECTS the teacher's last name to Mastin, instead of Masters.)

News NASA Robot to Explore &#39;Bottomless&#39; Pit Tue May 15, 11:00 AM ET A robotic yellow submarine will journey this week to the world&#39;s deepest sinkhole, which already has taken the life of one diver who sought to reach its bottom and discover the life that might exist there. Others have tried to reach the end of this seemingly bottomless pit in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, known to be at least 925 feet deep, but no one has ever succeeded. " (Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer) will search the depths of the El Zacaton cenote, or geothermal sinkhole, for life and also study its dimensions and look for the vents that feed it. , which funded the robotic explorer, views the mission as a test-run for a potential journey to Europa, a moon of Jupiter thought to contain liquid water beneath miles of ice--and possibly complex forms of life. New technologies that could help explore its ocean will be put to the test during the robot&#39;s descent. "We&#39;ll spend the first two days checking out DEPTHX&#39;s sensors, updating its software and performing a test dive to 250 meters [820 feet] to check its pressure housings," said David Wettergreen, who helped create the 8-foot-long Once the vessel passes it final exams, Wettergreen and his team will have six days to probe the sinkhole&#39;s watery depths. "It&#39;s an ambitious program," Wettergreen said, "but the vehicle performed well in two earlier field tests at the La Pilita cenote," another Mexican sinkhole. Software written by Carnegie Mellon University&#39;s Robotics Institute will allow the untethered sub to navigate in the sometimes closely confined underwater spaces and probe the pitch-black sinkhole with 56 sonar sensors for mapping. The progress of DEPTHX, as it gathers water and stone samples from the cenote&#39;s walls, can be monitored at the mission&#39;s DEPTHX also will be used to explore two , Caracol and Verde, during the team&#39;s two-week expedition.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070514/sc_nm/sleep_light_dc	Mars experiment might help Earthling insomniacs - Yahoo! News Mars experiment might help Earthling insomniacs By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor Mon May 14, 6:15 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An experiment aimed at finding ways to help astronauts adapt to life on Mars could end up helping insomniacs on Earth, researchers said on Monday. They found that two 45-minute exposures to bright light in the evening could help people adjust to a longer, Martian-style day. During the experiment, they found a wider-than-expected variation in an internal system the human body uses to keep track of days and nights, and they believe their treatment might help people with certain disorders of this system. "The results have powerful implications for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including shift work disorder and advanced sleep phase disorder," said Dr. Charles Czeisler, chief of the Division of Sleep Medicine at Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital and Harvard medical school in Boston. The U.S. space agency had asked Czeisler&#39;s lab to find ways to help astronauts adjust to life on Mars, where the days are about 24 hours and 39 minutes long, or 24.65 hours. This nearly 25-hour day is enough to throw most people into a state of jet lag, which Czeisler has shown interferes with the ability to learn, remember things, react quickly and to sleep. His team tested 12 healthy volunteers aged 22 to 33 who had kept a regular eight-hour sleep and 16-hour wakeful schedule at home for at least three weeks. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences National Academy of Sciences , they said the natural range of circadian days in just their group was from 23.47 hours to 24.48 hour days -- a full hour&#39;s difference. Tests on animals has shown there is a natural variation. Daylight tweaks the genetically determined circadian rhythm. "In virtually all cases, the exposure that we get to light ... keeps us in sync with the 24-hour day," Czeisler said in a telephone interview. But what "astounded" Czeisler was an additional difference in hormone release. They took blood from these volunteers every hour and found those people with the shorter internal clock released the sleep hormone melatonin four to five hours before their usual bedtimes, while those with unusually long internal days did not release melatonin until about an hour before bedtime. Other research has shown that using a computer after dark, working in a brightly lit office or other exposure to bright light can mess up a person&#39;s internal clock, making it harder to fall asleep. So Czeisler&#39;s team tested the volunteers in a similar way, using two 45-minute exposures to bright light for 30 days. The volunteers successfully adjusted to the Martian-length day, Czeisler said. This could mean that light therapy might help people whose insomnia is caused by having a long- or shorter-than-normal internal body clock, Czeisler said.

News White House pressed Ashcroft on wiretaps By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press WASHINGTON - A top Justice Department official thought 's no-warrant wiretapping program was so questionable that he refused for a time to reauthorize it, leading to a standoff with White House officials at the bedside of the ailing attorney general, a Senate panel was told Tuesday. Former Deputy Attorney General James Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he refused to recertify the program because Attorney General had reservations about its legality just before falling ill with pancreatitis in March 2004. The White House, Comey said, recertified the program without the Justice Department's signoff, allowing it to operate for about three weeks without concurrence on whether it was legal. Comey, Ashcroft, Director Robert Mueller and other Justice Department officials at one point considered resigning, Comey said. "I couldn't stay, if the administration was going to engage in conduct that the had said had no legal basis," Comey told the panel. A day after the March 10, 2004, incident at Ashcroft's hospital bedside, President Bush ordered changes to the program to accommodate the department's concerns. Ashcroft signed the presidential order to recertify the program about three weeks later. The dramatic hospital confrontation involved Comey, the acting attorney general during Ashcroft's absence, and a White House team that included Bush's then-counsel, Alberto Gonzales, and White House Chief of Staff Andy Card, Comey said. Gonzales later succeeded Ashcroft as attorney general. Senior government officials had expressed concerns about whether the National Security Agency, which administered the warrantless eavesdropping program, had the proper oversight in place. Other concerns included whether any president possessed the legal and constitutional authority to authorize the program as it operated at the time. Comey testified Tuesday that when he refused to certify the program, Gonzales and Card headed to Ashcroft's sick bed in the intensive care unit at George Washington University Hospital. When Gonzales appealed to Ashcroft, the ailing attorney general lifted his head off the pillow and in straightforward terms described his views of the program, Comey said. Then he pointed out that Comey, not Ashcroft, held the powers of the attorney general at that moment. Gonzales and Card then left the hospital room, Comey said. "I was angry," Comey told the panel. "I thought I had just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man who did not have the powers of the attorney general." Comey's testimony revived one of the Bush administration's most bitter internal fights just as Gonzales appeared less under siege about the firings of several U.S. attorneys last year. Bush has stood solidly by his longtime counselor's side; calls for Gonzales' resignation have waned in recent weeks. Asked about Comey's testimony, White House press secretary Tony Snow said he didn't know anything about the conversation at Ashcroft's bedside. But he defended the program. "Because he had an appendectomy, his brain didn't work?" Snow said of Ashcroft. "Jim Comey can talk about whatever reservations he may have had. But the fact is that there were strong protections in there, this program has saved lives and it's vital for national security and furthermore has been reformed in a bipartisan way." Dean Boyd, a Justice Department spokesman, said he couldn't comment on "internal discussions that may or may have not taken place concerning classified intelligence activities." But he said the program succeeded in helping detect and prevent terrorist attacks and was always subject to rigorous oversight and review. Democrats cited Comey's testimony as evidence of what they say is Gonzales' tendency to put loyalty to Bush ahead of most everything &#151; including Justice's tradition of independence from the politics of the White House. "What happened in that hospital room crystallized Mr. Gonzales' view about the rule of law: that he holds it in minimum low regard," said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Under questioning by Sen. Arlen Specter ( ), R-Pa., Comey said he was not threatened by Vice President or other White House officials who disagreed with him on the legality of the eavesdropping program. Comey recalled that after the bedside incident he started to offer his resignation and was persuaded to wait a few days until Ashcroft could resign with him. "Mr. Ashcroft's chief of staff asked me something that meant a great deal to him, and that is that I not resign until Mr. Ashcroft was well enough to resign with me," Comey said. On March 12 at their daily briefing of the president, Bush asked Comey and Mueller for separate private conversations on Justice's concerns about the eavesdropping program. There, Comey said, Bush agreed to do "the right thing." "We had the president's direction to do what we believed, what the Justice Department believed, was necessary to put this matter on a footing where we could certify to its legality," Comey said of the period after those private meetings. "We did that." Spokesmen for Ashcroft and Mueller refused requests for comment.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070515/us_nm/usa_falwell_dc	Evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 - Yahoo! News Evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 Tue May 15, 3:24 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. evangelist Jerry Falwell, a leader of the religious right who battled in the political arena against abortion and homosexuality, died on Tuesday at age 73. Falwell, who founded the Moral Majority as a conservative political force in 1979, was found unconscious in his office at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, and was taken to a nearby hospital. He had a history of congestive heart problems. Falwell had no heartbeat when he was found by colleagues at around 11:30 a.m., Dr. Carl Moore, his personal physician, said. He could not be resuscitated and was pronounced dead just over an hour later, Moore told a news conference. Falwell was one of the most prominent figures in the religious right, a powerful movement that seeks to redraw public policy in the United States along evangelical Christian lines. Fond of quipping that the Bible referred to "Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve," Falwell provoked a storm of protest when he said gays, lesbians and health workers who provide abortions were partly to blame for the September 11 attacks. "I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians ... all of them who have tried to secularize America, I point the finger in their face and say: you helped this happen," he said. For decades, Falwell had been an influential conservative voice in politics. Falwell founded the Thomas Road Baptist Church in his hometown of Lynchburg in 1956. He went on to found Liberty University in 1971 -- a conservative center of higher learning -- and in 1979 started the Moral Majority organization, which became a major vehicle for getting out the vote for the Republican Party. He disbanded the Moral Majority in 1989 but it was resurrected as The Moral Majority Coalition, with an explicit political purpose, after President George W. Bush President George W. Bush &#39;s re-election in 2004. Full Coverage: Rev.

News Little Mermaid statue vandalized Tue May 15, 10:44 AM ET COPENHAGEN, Denmark - Copenhagen's famed Little Mermaid statue was covered with paint by vandals, the second time it has been defaced since March. Tourists flocked to the landmark Tuesday to take snapshots of the bronze statue, whose face, left arm and lap had been doused with red paint. A wooden picture frame sat next to the statue, with the word "AV" &#151; Danish for "ouch" &#151; written in green. Police said they did not know who had defaced the statue, or whether it was connected to overnight clashes between riot police and rock-throwing youths near Copenhagen's hippie district Christiania. The Little Mermaid was created by Danish sculptor Edvard Eriksen in tribute to Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen. Sitting on a rock at the entrance of the Copenhagen harbor since 1913, she draws an estimated 1 million visitors a year, and has become a popular target for vandals. Four years ago, the statue was blown off her perch by culprits who used explosives. She has been beheaded and doused in paint several times. On March 3, vandals covered the statue with pink paint, which was quickly removed by a cleanup crew with soap and high-pressure water cleaners.

News Pollution turning Taj Mahal yellow Tue May 15, 6:47 AM ET NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pollution is turning the Taj Mahal yellow, despite efforts by the government to control air contamination around the poignant 17th century monument and keep it shimmering white, a parliamentary committee has said. In a report to parliament this week, the standing committee on transport, tourism and culture said airborne particles were being deposited on the monument&#39;s white marble, giving it a yellow tinge. The monument, in the city of Agra about four hours drive south of the capital, was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Authorities have made various attempts in the past to keep the area around the Taj Mahal pollution free, including setting up an air pollution monitoring station in Agra. But the committee said that while air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide gases were generally within permissible limits, "suspended particulate matter" had been recorded at high levels except during the rainy season. It suggested a clay pack treatment that is non-corrosive and non-abrasive be carried out to remove deposits on the marble. "The committee recommends that while undertaking any conservation activity at the Taj Mahal, abundant cautions should be taken to retain the original glory of the shimmering white marble used in this." Attracting around 20,000 visitors every day, the monument was completed in 1648 after 17 years of construction by 20,000 workers.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070514/ap_on_re_us/baby_psychiatry	Doctors look for early autism signs - Yahoo! News Doctors look for early autism signs By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer Mon May 14, 2:14 PM ET CHICAGO - Within days of their birth, healthy babies will look you in the eye. By 4 months, they will delight in others. And by 9 months, they will exchange smiles. Jacob Day did none of those things. "We used to say it was like it burned his eyes to look at you," said his mother, Tamie Day of Antelope, Calif. "It was like a physically painful thing for him. It wasn't just that he wasn't looking at us; he was purposefully looking away." Day, who has a psychology degree, suspected her son might have autism. She enrolled him in a study, published in April, that found that babies like Jacob are indeed at high risk for autism if they do not respond to their names by 12 months of age. At 18 months, he was formally diagnosed with autism, about a year earlier than usual. Before he turned 2, Jacob began daily intensive behavior treatment designed to help him lead a more normal life. He is part of a growing field in psychiatry called infant mental health. Doctors and scientists are increasingly looking for early signs in babies of autism, attention deficit disorder and other mental problems that just a generation ago, scarcely anyone thought could appear in children so young. Some scientists even believe that intensive treatment in some susceptible babies can actually prevent autism, attention deficit disorder and other problems. An influential Institute of Medicine report in 2000 helped energize this idea. The report emphasized the plasticity of babies' brains. It also explained how interacting with babies can change their brain wiring. "We used to say `nature versus nurture,' but now people really think it's 'nature through nurture,'" said the University of Chicago's Dr. Lawrence Gray. Tamie Day noticed the first ominous clue the night she and her husband, Chris, brought Jacob home after his birth. "We walked in the door and he wouldn't stop looking at our ceiling fan," she said. "The next day, that's all he would look at." Babies typically begin making eye contact soon after birth, and "understand at a basic, perhaps hardwired level, that eyes are special &#151; they look more at eyes than at other parts of the face," said Sally Ozonoff, an autism specialist at the University of California at Davis' MIND Institute. When his mother expressed her autism concerns at Jacob's 6-month checkup, the doctor said "we were being a little overzealous," Day said. Still, there was no pointing, no clapping, no shared smiles, and when Jacob would laugh, it seemed like his own private joke. So his parents sought out UC-Davis specialists, who gave them the heartbreaking diagnosis. Jacob, now 3 1/2, has made meaningful progress thanks to treatment, his mother said, including a breakthrough moment at age 2. It still makes her cry to recall it. She was giving Jacob a bath, playing the "itsy bitsy spider" finger game, when he looked up and really gazed into her eyes. "He was smiling up at me and I realized that was the first time he had done that," she said. "He has gorgeous blue eyes, and I was like, `My God, your eyes are so beautiful.'" Interest in infant mental health has been boosted by awareness of the prevalence of attention deficit disorders and autism, which government officials said in February affects 1 in 150 U.S. children and may be more common than previously thought. In April, researchers from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Interdisciplinary Council on Developmental and Learning Disorders presented a report emphasizing earlier diagnosis and treatment. The report said that about 17 percent of U.S. children have a developmental disability such as autism, mental retardation and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, but that fewer than half are diagnosed before starting school. The authors say warning signs include failure to: _focus on sights and sounds by 2 months. _initiate joyful behavior with parents by 4 months. _exchange smiles and sounds with parents by 8 to 9 months. _take a parent's hand to find a toy and point to objects by 12 to 16 months. Last year, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that pediatricians routinely evaluate children for developmental problems such as autism starting in infancy, and begin testing at age 9 months. "Waiting until a young child misses a major milestone such as walking or talking may result in late rather than early recognition ... depriving the child and family of the benefits of early identification and intervention," the academy said. Some critics worry that the trend will trigger needless diagnoses in children with normal variations in behavior. Dr. Michael Fitzpatrick, a London physician, said that while early recognition and treatment of true disorders are important, "the extension of these categories to include 20 to 30 percent of all children reflects a social trend of pathologizing and medicalizing children's lives, which seems to reflect difficulties of parents and teachers in dealing with familiar problems of childhood development." Dr. Stanley Greenspan, a psychiatry professor at George Washington University who co-authored the -Interdisciplinary group report, said the idea is not to slap a label on babies and give them medication. Greenspan said the goal is to raise awareness about early warning signs and to encourage treatment to increase the chances that children can develop normally. Research on identifying early clues and testing treatments is booming. For example: _Dr. Fred Volkmar at Yale University is studying potential ways to diagnose autism in the first months of life, including whether looking at objects rather than people is a sign. "I think we're on the verge of being able to do a much better job" of diagnosing autism in infancy, Volkmar said. _Researcher Stephen Porges at the University of Illinois at Chicago is starting a five-year study of whether excessive crying past 6 months of age might be an early sign of autism, attention deficit or other behavior problems. _Greenspan is launching a multimillion-dollar study involving parents and babies at risk for autism or attention deficit disorder. One group will receive intensive behavior training, the other will not; both will be compared through age 5. While rigorous scientific evidence is needed to prove that early intervention succeeds, Greenspan said his work with patients has shown promise. Jacob didn't say his first word, "more," until he was in treatment and almost 2 &#151; about a year later than normal. He didn't say "mama" until he was 3. He gets 33 hours of weekly home treatment with trained college students, including six hours most days. The tab is $70,000 yearly, paid for by California, one of the few states that pay, through state and federal funds, for early intensive autism treatment. Jacob's sessions involve lots of repetition, and rewards, including praise and treats, for a job well done. For example, to improve eye contact, teachers bounce him on a favorite giant ball, then stop. If he turns to look at them, he gets praise, maybe a piece of candy, and more bouncing. To teach language, they use activities like swinging that get him excited enough to make sounds, then offer rewards for sounds like vowels or consonants rather than humming. Then they name objects, encourage mimicking, and offer more rewards. Now he knows the alphabet, understands commands like "Bring me the cow and the horse toy," and can say simple sentences like "I want juice," his mother said. "We definitely hope to mainstream him. We hope that he will have a job and have a life where he can take care of himself and be happy," Day said. "Everyone has given us reason to believe that's not an outlandish expectation."

"I think we're on the verge of being able to do a much better job" of diagnosing autism in infancy, Volkmar said. _Researcher Stephen Porges at the University of Illinois at Chicago is starting a five-year study of whether excessive crying past 6 months of age might be an early sign of autism, attention deficit or other behavior problems. _Greenspan is launching a multimillion-dollar study involving parents and babies at risk for autism or attention deficit disorder. One group will receive intensive behavior training, the other will not; both will be compared through age 5. While rigorous scientific evidence is needed to prove that early intervention succeeds, Greenspan said his work with patients has shown promise. Jacob didn't say his first word, "more," until he was in treatment and almost 2 &#151; about a year later than normal. He didn't say "mama" until he was 3. He gets 33 hours of weekly home treatment with trained college students, including six hours most days. The tab is $70,000 yearly, paid for by California, one of the few states that pay, through state and federal funds, for early intensive autism treatment. Jacob's sessions involve lots of repetition, and rewards, including praise and treats, for a job well done. For example, to improve eye contact, teachers bounce him on a favorite giant ball, then stop. If he turns to look at them, he gets praise, maybe a piece of candy, and more bouncing. To teach language, they use activities like swinging that get him excited enough to make sounds, then offer rewards for sounds like vowels or consonants rather than humming. Then they name objects, encourage mimicking, and offer more rewards. Now he knows the alphabet, understands commands like "Bring me the cow and the horse toy," and can say simple sentences like "I want juice," his mother said. "We definitely hope to mainstream him. We hope that he will have a job and have a life where he can take care of himself and be happy," Day said. "Everyone has given us reason to believe that's not an outlandish expectation."

News NASA Robot to Explore &#39;Bottomless&#39; Pit Tue May 15, 11:00 AM ET A robotic yellow submarine will journey this week to the world&#39;s deepest sinkhole, which already has taken the life of one diver who sought to reach its bottom and discover the life that might exist there. Others have tried to reach the end of this seemingly bottomless pit in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, known to be at least 925 feet deep, but no one has ever succeeded. " (Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer) will search the depths of the El Zacaton cenote, or geothermal sinkhole, for life and also study its dimensions and look for the vents that feed it. , which funded the robotic explorer, views the mission as a test-run for a potential journey to Europa, a moon of Jupiter thought to contain liquid water beneath miles of ice--and possibly complex forms of life. New technologies that could help explore its ocean will be put to the test during the robot&#39;s descent. "We&#39;ll spend the first two days checking out DEPTHX&#39;s sensors, updating its software and performing a test dive to 250 meters [820 feet] to check its pressure housings," said David Wettergreen, who helped create the 8-foot-long Once the vessel passes it final exams, Wettergreen and his team will have six days to probe the sinkhole&#39;s watery depths. "It&#39;s an ambitious program," Wettergreen said, "but the vehicle performed well in two earlier field tests at the La Pilita cenote," another Mexican sinkhole. Software written by Carnegie Mellon University&#39;s Robotics Institute will allow the untethered sub to navigate in the sometimes closely confined underwater spaces and probe the pitch-black sinkhole with 56 sonar sensors for mapping. The progress of DEPTHX, as it gathers water and stone samples from the cenote&#39;s walls, can be monitored at the mission&#39;s DEPTHX also will be used to explore two , Caracol and Verde, during the team&#39;s two-week expedition.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_he_me/vitamins_prostate	Study: Vitamins tied to prostate cancer - Yahoo! News Study: Vitamins tied to prostate cancer WASHINGTON - There's more worrisome news about vitamins: Taking too many may increase men's risk of dying from prostate cancer. The study, being published Wednesday, doesn't settle the issue. But it is the biggest yet to suggest high-dose multivitamins may harm the prostate, and the latest chapter in the confusing quest to tell whether taking various vitamins really helps a variety of conditions &#151; or is a waste of money, or worse. Government scientists turned to a study tracking the diet and health of almost 300,000 men. About a third reported taking a daily multivitamin, and 5 percent were heavy users, swallowing the pills more than seven times a week. Within five years of the study's start, 10,241 men had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Some 1,476 had advanced cancer; 179 died. Heavy multivitamin users were almost twice as likely to get fatal prostate cancer as men who never took the pills, concludes the study in Wednesday's Journal of the Here's the twist: Overall, the researchers found no link between multivitamin use and early-stage prostate cancer. The researchers speculate that perhaps high-dose vitamins had little effect until a tumor appeared, and then could spur its growth. While similar but smaller studies have suggested a link, too, more rigorous research is needed, caution the National Cancer Institute scientists. This newest study involves men who voluntarily took vitamins, and those most at risk &#151; perhaps because they had a family history of the disease &#151; may have been more likely to take the pills in hopes of avoiding their fate. Still, "the findings lend further credence to the possibility of harm associated with increased use of supplements," Dr. Christian Gluud of Copenhagen University Hospital and Dr. Goran Bjelakovic of Serbia's University of Nis wrote in an accompanying editorial.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070515/us_nm/healthcare_usa_dc	U.S. healthcare expensive, inefficient: report - Yahoo! News U.S. healthcare expensive, inefficient: report By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor Tue May 15, 1:25 AM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans get the poorest health care and yet pay the most compared to five other rich countries, according to a report released on Tuesday. Germany, Britain, Australia and Canada all provide better care for less money, the Commonwealth Fund report found. "The U.S. health care system ranks last compared with five other nations on measures of quality, access, efficiency, equity, and outcomes," the non-profit group which studies health care issues said in a statement. Canada rates second worst out of the five overall. Germany scored highest, followed by Britain, Australia and New Zealand. "The United States is not getting value for the money that is spent on health care," Commonwealth Fund president Karen Davis said in a telephone interview. The group has consistently found that the United States, the only one of the six nations that does not provide universal health care, scores more poorly than the others on many measures of health care. President George W. Bush President George W. Bush , many employers and insurers have all agreed in recent months to overhaul the U.S. health care system -- an uncoordinated conglomeration of employer-funded care, private health insurance and government programs. The current system leaves about 45 million people with no insurance at all, according to U.S. government estimates from 2005, and many studies have shown most of these people do not receive preventive services that not only keep them healthier, but reduce long-term costs. Davis said the fund&#39;s researchers looked at hard data for the report. "It is pretty indisputable that we spend twice what other countries spend on average," she said. Per capita health spending in the United States in 2004 was &#36;6,102, twice that of Germany, which spent &#36;3,005. Canada spent &#36;3,165, New Zealand &#36;2,083 and Australia &#36;2,876, while Britain spent &#36;2,546 per person. "We focus primarily on measures that are sensitive to medical care making a difference -- infant mortality and healthy lives at age 60," Davis said. "Those are pretty key measures, like how long you live and whether you are going to die before age 75." Measures of other aspects of care such as cataract surgery or hip replacements is harder to come by, she said. They also looked at convenience and again found the United States lacking -- with a few exceptions. "We include measures such as waiting more than four months for elective, non-emergency surgery. The United States doesn&#39;t do as well as Germany but it does a lot better than the other countries on waiting time for surgery," Davis said. "We looked at the time it takes to get in to see your own doctor ... (or) once you go to the emergency room do you sit there for more than two hours, and truthfully, we don&#39;t do well on those measures," Davis said. According to the report, 61 percent of U.S. patients said it was somewhat or very difficult to get care on nights or weekends, compared with 25 percent to 59 percent in other countries. "The area where the U.S. health care system performs best is preventive care, an area that has been monitored closely for over a decade by managed care plans," the report reads. The United States had the fewest patients -- 84 percent -- reporting that they have a regular doctor. And U.S. doctors are the least wired, with the lowest percentage using electronic medical records or receiving electronic updates on recommended treatments.

News Stallone pleads guilty to import charges By MERAIAH FOLEY, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 2:08 AM ET SYDNEY, Australia - Actor Sylvester Stallone pleaded guilty Tuesday to bringing vials of restricted muscle-building hormones into Australia and faces sentencing next week. Lawyers for the 60-year-old star of the "Rocky" and "Rambo" movies entered the guilty pleas on behalf of the actor, who did not appear before Sydney's Downing Center Local Court. "I made a terrible mistake, not because I was attempting to deceive anyone but I was simply ignorant to your official rules," Stallone said in a letter to Sydney's Local Court. "I feel terrible that my breach of the rules has set a poor example to members of the public, whose opinion I cherish dearly." Stallone was accused of bringing banned substances into Australia after a customs search of his luggage during a Feb. 16 visit to Sydney revealed 48 vials of the human growth hormone product, Jintropin. Three days later, Stallone threw four vials of the male hormone testosterone from his Sydney hotel room when customs officials arrived to search it, prosecutor David Agius told the court. Human growth hormone, a naturally occurring substance that can be replicated synthetically and is used to build muscle mass, is considered a performance enhancing drug in Australia and it cannot be imported without a permit from the national drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration. The maximum penalty for bringing Jintropin into Australia illegally is a fine of $91,500 and five years in prison, but Stallone faces a maximum penalty of just $18,000 on each of the two charges because the matter is being heard by a local, not federal, court. Deputy Chief Magistrate Paul Cloran said Stallone would be sentenced on Monday next week. Stallone's lawyer Phillip Boulten said the actor should be spared a criminal conviction, saying Stallone took the hormones for medical reasons that he did not specify. "The defendant, Sylvester Stallone, is extremely mortified about having been involved in this incident," Boulten told the court. "Had he known that what he was doing was contrary to Australian law, he almost certainly would not have done it." But Agius said Stallone had demonstrated a "consciousness of guilt" by throwing the testosterone from the hotel. Boulten said Stallone was taking both substances under medical supervision. "This is not some back-alley body builder dealing covertly with some banned substance in some sort of secret way," he said. "This was a legitimate medical condition being treated by doctors of the top ranking order in the west coast of the United States." Agius told Cloran that Stallone was to have appeared in the court through a video link but that that plan had been abandoned. Agius did not elaborate. Prosecution documents handed to the court in March said Stallone had marked "No" on a customs declaration card that asked if he was bringing into Australia restricted or prohibited goods "such as medicines, steroids, firearms, weapons, or any kind of illicit drugs." During his visit to Australia, Stallone shrugged off the airport incident. "It was just a minor misunderstanding," Stallone told reporters "They were just doing their jobs. I just didn't understand some of the rules here." He came to Australia on a three-day tour to promote the latest movie in the "Rocky" series, "Rocky Balboa." A media throng was kept waiting for hours outside Sydney International Airport for the actor and his entourage. When a tightlipped Stallone emerged, he signed his autograph for several fans but avoided media questions about the delay.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_go_co/eavesdropping	White House pressed Ashcroft on wiretaps - Yahoo! News White House pressed Ashcroft on wiretaps By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press WASHINGTON - A top Justice Department official thought 's no-warrant wiretapping program was so questionable that he refused for a time to reauthorize it, leading to a standoff with White House officials at the bedside of the ailing attorney general, a Senate panel was told Tuesday. Former Deputy Attorney General James Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he refused to recertify the program because Attorney General had reservations about its legality just before falling ill with pancreatitis in March 2004. The White House, Comey said, recertified the program without the Justice Department's signoff, allowing it to operate for about three weeks without concurrence on whether it was legal. Comey, Ashcroft, Director Robert Mueller and other Justice Department officials at one point considered resigning, Comey said. "I couldn't stay, if the administration was going to engage in conduct that the had said had no legal basis," Comey told the panel. A day after the March 10, 2004, incident at Ashcroft's hospital bedside, President Bush ordered changes to the program to accommodate the department's concerns. Ashcroft signed the presidential order to recertify the program about three weeks later. The dramatic hospital confrontation involved Comey, the acting attorney general during Ashcroft's absence, and a White House team that included Bush's then-counsel, Alberto Gonzales, and White House Chief of Staff Andy Card, Comey said. Gonzales later succeeded Ashcroft as attorney general. Senior government officials had expressed concerns about whether the National Security Agency, which administered the warrantless eavesdropping program, had the proper oversight in place. Other concerns included whether any president possessed the legal and constitutional authority to authorize the program as it operated at the time. Comey testified Tuesday that when he refused to certify the program, Gonzales and Card headed to Ashcroft's sick bed in the intensive care unit at George Washington University Hospital. When Gonzales appealed to Ashcroft, the ailing attorney general lifted his head off the pillow and in straightforward terms described his views of the program, Comey said. Then he pointed out that Comey, not Ashcroft, held the powers of the attorney general at that moment. Gonzales and Card then left the hospital room, Comey said. "I was angry," Comey told the panel. "I thought I had just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man who did not have the powers of the attorney general." Comey's testimony revived one of the Bush administration's most bitter internal fights just as Gonzales appeared less under siege about the firings of several U.S. attorneys last year. Bush has stood solidly by his longtime counselor's side; calls for Gonzales' resignation have waned in recent weeks. Asked about Comey's testimony, White House press secretary Tony Snow said he didn't know anything about the conversation at Ashcroft's bedside. But he defended the program. "Because he had an appendectomy, his brain didn't work?" Snow said of Ashcroft. "Jim Comey can talk about whatever reservations he may have had. But the fact is that there were strong protections in there, this program has saved lives and it's vital for national security and furthermore has been reformed in a bipartisan way." Dean Boyd, a Justice Department spokesman, said he couldn't comment on "internal discussions that may or may have not taken place concerning classified intelligence activities." But he said the program succeeded in helping detect and prevent terrorist attacks and was always subject to rigorous oversight and review. Democrats cited Comey's testimony as evidence of what they say is Gonzales' tendency to put loyalty to Bush ahead of most everything &#151; including Justice's tradition of independence from the politics of the White House. "What happened in that hospital room crystallized Mr. Gonzales' view about the rule of law: that he holds it in minimum low regard," said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Under questioning by Sen. Arlen Specter ( ), R-Pa., Comey said he was not threatened by Vice President or other White House officials who disagreed with him on the legality of the eavesdropping program. Comey recalled that after the bedside incident he started to offer his resignation and was persuaded to wait a few days until Ashcroft could resign with him. "Mr. Ashcroft's chief of staff asked me something that meant a great deal to him, and that is that I not resign until Mr. Ashcroft was well enough to resign with me," Comey said. On March 12 at their daily briefing of the president, Bush asked Comey and Mueller for separate private conversations on Justice's concerns about the eavesdropping program. There, Comey said, Bush agreed to do "the right thing." "We had the president's direction to do what we believed, what the Justice Department believed, was necessary to put this matter on a footing where we could certify to its legality," Comey said of the period after those private meetings. "We did that." Spokesmen for Ashcroft and Mueller refused requests for comment.

News Wis. festival sells deep-fried testicles Sun May 13, 2:56 PM ET ELDERON, Wis. - Around here, it may be tough to pass up anything deep-fried. Wisconsinites have deep-fried cheese curds, candy bars and Twinkies. They now have deep-fried livestock testicles, too. More than 300 people paid $5 for all-you-can-eat goat, lamb and bull testicles Saturday at the ninth annual Testicle Festival at Mama's Place Bar and Grill in Elderon in central Wisconsin. "Once you get over the mental (aspect) of what you're eating, it's just like eating any other food, and it tastes good," Buster Hoffman said. Festival founder Nancy Fenske said the festival grew out of her late husband Roger's birthday party 12 years ago. They decided to have "a nut fry" at Mama's Place after bringing back lamb fries from a trip to Montana. The event grew every year and now they fry up to 100 pounds of testicles, she said. "What else can you do in a small town?" Fenske said. Butch Joubert, 58, likes the parts sandwiched between bread with tartar sauce. They're not so different from regular meatballs also served at the festival, he said. "After a few beers, you can't really tell the difference," Joubert said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/mostemailed/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070514/ap_on_en_ot/mr__pop_culture	Syracuse prof is pop culture ambassador - Yahoo! News Syracuse prof is pop culture ambassador By JOCELYN NOVECK, AP National Writer Mon May 14, 3:33 PM ET SYRACUSE, N.Y. - Last week was pretty slow in the world of pop culture news. But the media sought out Robert Thompson just the same. The Syracuse University professor was quoted on the image of motherhood on TV. On the phenomenon of animal shows on cable. The danger of Hollywood trilogies. 's future. The hipness of being a nerd. Such exposure is nothing unusual for Thompson, a font of pop culture knowledge like few others. There may well be an expert somewhere who has a more wide-ranging, obsessive knowledge of this highly amorphous subject. But if so, they're keeping quiet about it. And it would be hard for the amiable, 47-year-old Thompson to keep quiet at this point, even if he wanted to. Because reporters from all over the world would keep calling &#151; to get his witty analysis of Katie Couric's debut on CBS, of vintage furniture, of the growth of barbecue culture. He's been called, half-jokingly, the most quoted man in America. That's not exactly true; we do have a president. But on certain days, when the pop culture firmament is busy, well, just Google his name. "I've seen Bob get 60, 70, 80 media calls in one day," says the man who hired him at Syracuse, David Rubin, dean of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. "I've seen him in a hallway on his cell phone for hours. You could go so far as to say Bob is the most quoted academic in the United States." So often has Thompson been quoted, over 17 years at Syracuse, that some news organizations (including The Associated Press) have lately tried consciously NOT to quote him. But nobody said we couldn't write ABOUT him. So while Syracuse, the seat of Onondaga County, about 250 miles from New York City, would hardly seem a mecca of pop culture, it seems a worthwhile journey to meet one of the only men on the planet capable of riffing rhapsodically, on cue, about the history of the aluminum lawn chair. The first thing you notice in Thompson's office are the TV sets. Not because three in one office is so unusual &#151; though this office does seem rather spacious for an academic, not to mention the view &#151; but because of what's playing. Not CNN or Fox News, but an episode of "The Show" on TV Land. TV is Thompson's passion; his office shelves are lined with old VHS tapes filled with countless hours of shows. A short walk away is the lecture hall where he teaches his spring undergraduate class. On this, the last day of the semester, Thompson has three hours to wrap up the history of television. He whips into action, starting with the early '50s and Lucy and Desi. Before you can say "Hill Street Blues" he's up to the '80s &#151; the second "Golden Age" of television &#151; by way of "Quincy" and "Barnaby Jones." At the turn of the century, Thompson argues, television is at its all-time best, with HBO the crown jewel. "The Larry Sanders Show." "Oz." "Sex and the City." "The Sopranos." "Rome." And so on. He turns to reality TV, which, in a typically sweeping yet concise Thompson-ism, he calls "the most interesting new way to tell a story since the invention of the novel." It began in Britain, he explains, and then "the virus jumped over the Atlantic and spread." "Survivor" is dissected. So is "Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?" and "Temptation Island." Have you ever noticed how conservative "The Bachelor" is, he muses, with all these girls waiting for a kiss? Stephanie from South Carolina has recently been rejected by bachelor Andy, he notes. Yes, he does watch all this stuff. Now he broaches the "single biggest event in all of TV history" &#151; coverage of the 9/11 terror attacks. He plays a good hour of CNN from that awful morning, reminding the students, most of whom were about 14 then, how it felt to watch the twin towers collapse on live TV. When he later plays segments of an MTV documentary on pop culture post-9/11, no one flinches when one of its featured commentators turns out to be Thompson. The students are used to it. The class ends with society's current fixation on YouTube, the wildly popular video-sharing site. And one lesson from that, he notes, is how our collective attention span has shrunk. We can't watch a YouTube clip that's more than a few minutes long. To prove it, he plays a tedious clip of someone's pet cat playing the piano. "Seven minutes," another Thompson-ism goes, "is the new 'War and Peace.'" Back in his office later that evening, Thompson explains the genesis of his interest in pop culture. He did his undergraduate work at the University of Chicago, where he initially planned to be an art history professor. But on Sunday nights, when the dorms didn't serve food, he would eat takeout in front of the TV. He found that he chose "CHiPs," with , over PBS, and became fascinated with the question: "Why do smart people watch dumb TV?" He did his thesis on Dante's "Divine Comedy," but came to believe that "art could be something that came out of a TV set." That led to a broader interest in popular culture. "I realized that to understand TV you needed to understand the network radio era. And vaudeville. And the circus. And comic strips. Every year I would binge on something." He did his masters and doctorate at Northwestern, and arrived in 1990 at Syracuse, where he now heads the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture. Over the years, reaction from traditional academics to his chosen field has become much less hostile, he says. "Now, there isn't a university that doesn't have a course on the history of rock 'n' roll," he notes. Thompson, who's written or edited six books of his own, gets up each day at five to read; he consumes three new books a week, not to mention uncounted hours of TV. (He also has a family that he spends time with.) He's constantly becoming enamored with new areas of pop culture. A couple years ago, for example, he realized he didn't know enough about Shakespeare &#151; a pop culture figure of his time, after all. He decided to watch all existing plays on VHS or DVD. In three months he watched 113 plays and read 25 books on the bard. "I was crazed," he says contentedly. Then there's his interest in the webbed aluminum lawn chair. "They're really taken for granted," he says. He's happy to explain how the phenomenon began with extra metal from wartime scrap drives, combined with explosive growth in America's suburbs. Right now, Thompson's focusing his pop-culture lens on ancient times. "I'm interested in the celebrity culture of ancient Rome," he says. "Back then, as now, it was who you knew that got you into parties." It dovetails with a broader Thompson thesis: So many things that we think are new, really aren't. "American Idol," you say? Nothing new, he replies. Remember Ted Mack's "Original Amateur Hour?" It's not just the breadth of Thompson's interests that make him so quotable. It's his accessibility &#151; he returns phone calls promptly &#151; and the un-academic way he speaks: in snappy sentences that are easy to digest. "I don't speak in clauses," he acknowledges. "I believe in periods." Some might actually say he speaks in soundbites &#151; the media gossip site Jossip.com has in fact drily called him "Mr. Soundbite," and Thompson himself notes he's been called a "quote whore." But reporters point out that he thinks hard to come up with something different and interesting. "Unlike many people in his position, he almost always finds an angle or perspective that I hadn't thought about," says AP Television Writer David Bauder. Angela Nelson, a professor at Bowling Green State University, says Thompson is "performing a great service for the discipline. Television in particular has been seen to be trivial, and his paying attention to it and preserving it is good for the culture." Nelson is the head of her university's Popular Culture department &#151; the only full department in the country devoted to the subject, established in the 1970s. (Most pop culture courses are nestled in other departments like English, communications, or sociology.) Thompson has been quoted so often, at least one reporter has told him of a "moratorium" at their newspaper on quoting him. One can see why editors would notice. At The New York Times alone, an archive search shows Thompson quoted more than 40 times in the last four years, by writers in a wide range of areas. At the AP, he's been quoted close to 20 times in the past year. "These days, answers are so predictable, crafted and cliche," says journalism teacher , of the Poynter Institute in Florida. "Somebody who thinks on their feet, relies on a well of knowledge and is curious about the world at large can be an invaluable resource." Clark, who notes he's unfamiliar with Thompson, adds: "As long as it doesn't turn journalists into lazybones." Thompson says he's weary of the most-quoted-guy label, but Rubin, his dean, says: "Bob is very proud of his status. He's just got a certain modesty about him." He adds that Thompson is not at all hierarchical: If a school paper calls before a major news organization, they'll get the return call first. As a teacher, Thompson is said to be generous with his time, though he's known as a tough grader &#151; something that can disappoint a student hoping to get an easy ride in a pop culture class. "He really has a lot of time for his students," says Carolyn Davis, a doctoral student in media studies who assisted Thompson this semester. "People will come in just to talk, and he'll order lunch." In any case, the university loves his star status. "My job is to keep Bob happy," says Rubin. Thompson says he learns from the give-and-take with the media. Besides, it's a teacher's job to preach what he knows &#151; and Thompson feels Americans need a basic working knowledge of their own pop culture. "To understand the history of this nation," he says, leaving you with one last Thompson-ism, "you have to understand its presidents and its wars. "But you also need to understand its lawn ornaments and its cheeseburgers."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_he_me/vitamins_prostate	Study: Vitamins tied to prostate cancer - Yahoo! News Study: Vitamins tied to prostate cancer WASHINGTON - There's more worrisome news about vitamins: Taking too many may increase men's risk of dying from prostate cancer. The study, being published Wednesday, doesn't settle the issue. But it is the biggest yet to suggest high-dose multivitamins may harm the prostate, and the latest chapter in the confusing quest to tell whether taking various vitamins really helps a variety of conditions &#151; or is a waste of money, or worse. Government scientists turned to a study tracking the diet and health of almost 300,000 men. About a third reported taking a daily multivitamin, and 5 percent were heavy users, swallowing the pills more than seven times a week. Within five years of the study's start, 10,241 men had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Some 1,476 had advanced cancer; 179 died. Heavy multivitamin users were almost twice as likely to get fatal prostate cancer as men who never took the pills, concludes the study in Wednesday's Journal of the Here's the twist: Overall, the researchers found no link between multivitamin use and early-stage prostate cancer. The researchers speculate that perhaps high-dose vitamins had little effect until a tumor appeared, and then could spur its growth. While similar but smaller studies have suggested a link, too, more rigorous research is needed, caution the National Cancer Institute scientists. This newest study involves men who voluntarily took vitamins, and those most at risk &#151; perhaps because they had a family history of the disease &#151; may have been more likely to take the pills in hopes of avoiding their fate. Still, "the findings lend further credence to the possibility of harm associated with increased use of supplements," Dr. Christian Gluud of Copenhagen University Hospital and Dr. Goran Bjelakovic of Serbia's University of Nis wrote in an accompanying editorial.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/faked_attack	School workers suspended in fake attack - Yahoo! News School workers suspended in fake attack Mon May 14, 11:14 PM ET MURFREESBORO, Tenn. - Two school employees who staged a fake gun attack on a group of students during a field trip have been suspended, school officials said Monday. During the last night of a weeklong trip to a state park, staff members convinced 69 sixth-grade students from Scales Elementary School that there was a gunman on the loose. One official has said the exercise was intended as a teaching tool. The students were told to lie on the floor or hide underneath tables and stay quiet. After the lights went out, some of the children began to cry. A teacher, disguised in a hooded sweat shirt, pulled on locked doors. Teacher Quentin Mastin and assistant principal Don Bartch were suspended for unprofessional conduct and neglect of duty because of the staged attack, schools director Marilyn Mathis said Monday. Calls to the district offices were not answered after hours Monday. A call to Bartch's home went unanswered Monday night, and a listing for Mastin could not be found. The suspension is without pay and lasts until the end of the school year on June 1, The Daily News Journal of Murfreesboro reported. "This was not a good experience," said Alisha Graves, whose son went on the trip. "Those kids were crying, and they were terrified." Some parents said they were upset by the staff's poor judgment in light of the April 16 shootings at Virginia Tech that left 33 people dead, including the gunman. Bartch, who was present, has said the scenario was intended as a learning experience and lasted only five minutes. "We got together and discussed what we would have done in a real situation," he said. (This version CORRECTS the teacher's last name to Mastin, instead of Masters.)

News Little Mermaid statue vandalized Tue May 15, 10:44 AM ET COPENHAGEN, Denmark - Copenhagen's famed Little Mermaid statue was covered with paint by vandals, the second time it has been defaced since March. Tourists flocked to the landmark Tuesday to take snapshots of the bronze statue, whose face, left arm and lap had been doused with red paint. A wooden picture frame sat next to the statue, with the word "AV" &#151; Danish for "ouch" &#151; written in green. Police said they did not know who had defaced the statue, or whether it was connected to overnight clashes between riot police and rock-throwing youths near Copenhagen's hippie district Christiania. The Little Mermaid was created by Danish sculptor Edvard Eriksen in tribute to Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen. Sitting on a rock at the entrance of the Copenhagen harbor since 1913, she draws an estimated 1 million visitors a year, and has become a popular target for vandals. Four years ago, the statue was blown off her perch by culprits who used explosives. She has been beheaded and doused in paint several times. On March 3, vandals covered the statue with pink paint, which was quickly removed by a cleanup crew with soap and high-pressure water cleaners.

News Miami holds top spot on rude driver list By SARAH LARIMER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 9:07 AM ET MIAMI - For the second straight year, rude Miami drivers have earned the city the title of worst road rage in a survey released Tuesday. Miami motorists said they saw other drivers slam on their brakes, run red lights and talk on cell phones, according to AutoVantage, a Connecticut-based automobile membership club offering travel services and roadside assistance. Other cities near the top of the rude drivers list were New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. South Miami resident Erik Pinto told The Associated Press he's probably seen every bad driving habit on Miami's roads. "You don't want to know what I've seen," Pinto said. "I've seen everything. I'm from L.A., and we don't see the crazy drivers that you see here." Portland, Ore., drivers were the least likely of the cities to see other motorists tailgating on the roadways, and St. Louis motorists were the least likely to swear at another driver, the survey found. Minneapolis-St. Paul was rated the most courteous city in 2006 but slipped to the middle of the list this year. The most frequent cause of road rage cited in the survey was impatient motorists. Drivers also cited poor driving in fast lanes and driving while stressed, frustrated or angry. "The best piece of advice is to take a deep breath. Slow down, be aware and be careful," AutoVantage spokesman Todd Smith said, adding the aim of the survey is to increase driver safety across the nation. More than 2,500 drivers who regularly commute in 25 major metropolitan areas were asked to rate road rage and rude driving in telephone surveys between January and March. The survey was conducted by Prince Market Research has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.
