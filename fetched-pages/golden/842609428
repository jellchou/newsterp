In Berlin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested the U.S. was destabilizing the situation in Lebanon by shipping weapons to the army for its fight against the militants _ drawing a pointed rebuke from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

Heavy clashes between the Lebanese army and al-Qaida-linked Islamic militants broke a weeklong truce as Lebanon's government stressed its determination to defeat the terrorists but said it was willing to give mediation a chance to end the fighting at a Palestinian refugee camp. (AP Photo/Nasser Nasser) (Nasser Nasser - AP) The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article The Lebanese military has been fighting Fatah Islam militants at the Nahr el-Bared refugee camp in northern Lebanon since May 20. The camp is ringed by hundreds of soldiers backed by artillery and tanks in place to storm the camp. Fatah Islam has claimed to have more than 500 fighters with automatic weapons, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades inside the camp. The Lebanese government has vowed to crush the militants. Fighting between the army and militants resumed shortly after sunset Wednesday at the camp on the outskirts of the port city of Tripoli. Army artillery blasted militant positions inside the camp to silence the source of fire. There was no immediate word on casualties. Several Fatah Islam suspects have been arrested in army raids on apartments in Tripoli in the past two weeks. It was not clear where the 20 militants were arrested. The 20 included 18 Lebanese, a nonnative Lebanese and a Syrian. All were charged with committing terrorist acts that resulted in the deaths of soldiers and civilians, the officials said. The charges against them also include forming a gang with the aim of committing crimes against the people and undermining state authority. All 20 are in custody and if convicted, they could face the death penalty. Sporadic gunfire exchanges have continued daily since a truce halted three days of heavy fighting. But renewed fighting that began before sundown Tuesday was the worst outbreak in violence in a week. Lebanese army artillery pounded positions on the northern edge of the camp and near the Mediterranean coastline, apparently to prevent militants from fleeing. Since the fighting began, 31 soldiers, 20 civilians and about 60 militants have been killed. Thousands of Palestinians have fled the camp but thousands more are still inside, along with hundreds of fighters. The standoff has raised concerns of more violence across Lebanon, which has 12 Palestinian refugee camps and various armed groups. The U.S. has airlifted planeloads of military supplies to Beirut to support the Lebanese troops in their battle with the militants. Lavrov, speaking at a news conference of the Quartet of Middle East peace negotiators in Berlin, was asked about the shipments and responded with a remark about "the necessity of avoiding weapons supplies that could destabilize the situation." Rice, sitting just to his right at the German Foreign Ministry, responded quickly that the U.S. was attempting to help rebuild the Lebanese army so it can defend the country against armed groups. "The rebuilding of the Lebanese army is envisioned in any number of international agreements ... and that is what we are doing," Rice said. "We are supporting the Lebanese army, which is an all-Lebanese institution. It's not a matter of interfering in Lebanese affairs, it's an effort to help Lebanon to defend its own sovereignty." U.S. arms are a sensitive issue in a nation deeply divided between supporters of Prime Minister Fuad Saniora's government and an opposition backed by America's Mideast foes, and Syria. The opposition led by the Shiite Islamic militant group Hezbollah accuses Saniora of being too close to Washington.

Malaysian court throws out appeal in key ruling on Islam Putrajaya, May 30: Malaysia's highest court on Wednesday threw out a bid by a woman seeking to have her conversion to Christianity from Islam officially recognised. A three-judge panel of the Federal Court rejected an appeal by Lina Joy in a case that went to the heart of a debate here on whether civil courts should take precedence over tribunals based on Islamic sharia law. Joy's appeal centred on whether she should be required to go before a sharia court to have her renunciation -- seen as one of the gravest sins in Islam -- recognised before authorities delete the word "Islam" from her identity card. Chief Judge Ahmad Fairuz said the National Registration Department, which is in charge of issuing identity cards, had the right to demand that a sharia court certify Joy's conversion. "On the question that the National Registration Department has the right to demand a certification from the Islamic court that confirms the appellant's renunciation of Islam, my answer is that NRD has the right," the judge said. "The appeal has been rejected with cause." *Your friend's e-mail address: 7 NATO soldiers killed in Afghan crash No breakthrough on resumption of six-party talks on North Korea Shimon Peres announces Israeli presidency bid Al Gore flays American citizens for Bush`s policies Yahoo!

Yaþar Büyükanýt said a military operation in northern Iraq is necessary and they wait for a relevant decision to be made by political mechanism. While the heaviest military build-up of recent years goes on in the Iraq border in eastern Turkey, preparations for a possible operation were launched. The retired general at a key post to provide cooperation and communication between Turkey and the U.S. regarding the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party's (PKK) terror, removed from office by the government. Last week's suicide bombing in Ankara and confessions of terrorists caught in numerous cities in this process strengthened the conviction that the PKK targets big cities. The violation of Turkish airspace last week by two U.S. F 16s created the impression that the government and armed forces are at odds. And finally, Kurdish administrators in northern Iraq made statements in the meaning “Turkish tanks cannot find way to these lands.” Operation by press releases?: Undoubtedly the key issue needs to be clarified here is the situation that produces reservations about politics-military relations and confuses the minds. By all means, neither from the military nor the politics perspective sharing thoughts about an imaginary military operation through press releases is normal. It is even needless to say that this is against the traditions of Turkish Army and the general principles of military professional. And only to know this requires a deduction that something is odd, there is something unusual. If you ask, what is “unusual”, my answer would be: The U.S. factor&#8230; Let me elaborate this a bit more: In the good old days, “Army to Iraq” meant a “hot pursue” or a “cross border operation”. And in legal perspective, all military operations before the U.S. invasion in Iraq were held by the approval of Baghdad and in the frame of mutual agreement with the neighboring country. But now, the situation has changed. Neither the approval of Baghdad nor of Washington is the point at issue. To the opposite, statements made by both capitals give the impression of an objection and even an implicit/explicit threat against Turkey. Therefore regardless of the decision by political body in Ankara depends on the ground of “terror” it will blatantly have the characteristic of a “declaration of war”. Intervention at all odds?: Let me get to the point. I am of the opinion that the public impression of a communication break down between the military and the politics stems from that the Turkish army will be facing the U.S. forces in northern Iraq. Because the presence of Kurdish peshmerga in northern Iraq does not justify who the dominant power is in the region. Therefore it is reasonable to explain the limped communication between the Turkish Armed Forces and the government by the desire to reach a prompt conclusion in the diplomatic initiatives with Washington. Observation of escalating desire “intervention at all odds” in the Turkish army might strengthen the hands of foreign affairs having hard time to express itself in Washington. But if you ask the question whether the army will enter Iraq, the answer of course will be it is possible if suicide bombings similar to the one in Ankara continue. Apparently as long as the investigation about the suicide attack of Anafartalar Avenue in Ankara is in progress, opportunities will rise to make some new assessments beyond clarifying the incident as an attack by the PKK. I previously mentioned that there are some groups in Washington making calculations to provoke Turkish military and dragging it into the quagmire in Iraq. And the military will be worn out in a “nightmare period”, civilian decision making mechanism will be strengthened etc&#8230; I hope we will not end up loses because of the incertitude originates from election and politics discussions. The realm of the state cannot afford the games of “pretends”&#8230; &copy; 2005 Dogan Daily News Inc.

Yasar Buyukanit Thursday criticized some countries for supporting the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported. "There are countries supporting directly or indirectly PKK terrorism, among our allies," affirmed Buyukanit at an international symposium on "New Dimensions of Security and International Organizations," without specifying the countries. "Land mines used in and explosives such as C4, A3, A4 which are used in every murder in Turkey are not bought from supermarkets," Buyukanit said. "Countries (backing terrorism for political purposes) use double standard in combatting terrorism, and turn a blind eye to activities of persons or organizations that do not stage terrorist attacks on their own territories," Buyukanit stated. Buyukanit added that those who extend financial, logistical and propagandist support to terrorists should be deemed as terrorist. Buyukanit said there is a need for global cooperation against terrorism, reiterating that Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) are ready for international cooperation and solidarity, and sharing information and intelligence regarding security issues. An efficient international cooperation in fight against terrorism is only possible under the banner of the UN, Buyukanit said. In a bid to get rid of the threats of PKK, Turkey has recently warned that Turkish troops would launch a cross-border operation into northern in fighting against the outlawed Kurdish group. "We have earlier stated that there was a need for a cross- border operation into northern Iraq," said Buyukanit, adding " necessary planning can be made after political targets are determined." On May 22, a suicide bomb blast ripped through a crowded shopping center in the Ulus district of Turkish capital Ankara, killing seven, including the bomber, and injuring some 100 others. Officials believed the PKK was behind the attack. PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by the and the European Union, launched an armed campaign for an ethnic homeland in the mainly Kurdish southeastern Turkey in 1984, sparking decades of strife that has claimed more than 30,000 lives. The intensity of the fighting eased after PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured and imprisoned in 1999, but flared up again in recent years.

Many refugees, however, oppose the plan because of fears that it might allow the full-scale destruction of Nahr al-Bared and prevent them from returning to their homes. Finding alternative shelter for the estimated 15,000 displaced Palestinians in Beddawi is critical, because the camp has seen its population double in the past week, said UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) spokeswoman Hoda Samra. "It's critical for us at this stage to look into an alternative shelter to relieve some of the congestion in the camp, because we are talking about thousands of people now," she said on Wednesday. "It's just too overcrowded. "There is huge pressure on the water and electricity networks, and they can't sustain this amount of people." Although the details have yet to be worked out, UNRWA will most likely put up prefabricated accommodations on the edge of Beddawi and install mobile generators, portable showers, toilets and water tanks, Samra added. UNRWA has not yet estimated the number of families to be housed there. Nahr al-Bared refugees demonstrated in Beddawi on Tuesday for the right to return to their homes. "When we left the camp, we decided to stay one or two days and then return to Nahr al-Bared, but they don't want us to go back because they want to destroy it," Ashraf abu-Khourz said on the phone from Beddawi. "The situation [in Nahr al-Bared] was bad when we left, and now it has become worse. People don't want to stay here. More than 20,000 people came here and Beddawi is small - there are no places to sleep or bathe. We are Muslims, and there are eight families in one classroom. Men are sleeping in the streets because they won't sleep in schools with women." The rising number of checkpoints is preventing many Palestinian students from North Lebanon from traveling to university for final exams, because residents of Beddawi and Nahr al-Bared have been detained by security forces and sometimes arrested for suspected ties to Fatah al-Islam militants, said Khourz. Huda al-Turk, another UNRWA spokeswoman working in Beddawi, said moving the displaced to temporary housing units on the outskirts of the camp is one of many solutions being debated. "So far we are still looking into other alternatives," Turk said in a phone interview from Beddawi, but she declined to give details. Beddawi, however, will not be able to sustain the current arrangement for much longer. "There is not enough space in the schools, and it is increasing the economic burden of hosting families," Turk said. "We are OK for food supplies now - even host families are receiving assistance. The critical issue is clothing now, because everyone left with nothing." The fighting has also entirely paralyzed the education systems of both camps. Finding alternative shelter for the displaced currently living in UNRWA schools in Beddawi would allow children to finish classes for the year, said Yasser Daoud, a former Nahr al-Bared resident and field worker for the NGO Nebaah in Tyre. "[The plan] is good, because the children from Nahr al-Bared and Beddawi will be able to go to school again, but people are afraid that if this type of camp is established, it will become permanent," said Daoud. Daoud has heard from other humanitarian agencies that 2,000 residences in Nahr al-Bared have already been demolished, though no formal assessment has been made because access to the camp is still restricted. "My mother, sister, and brother are still in Nahr al-Bared because they don't want to repeat what happened to them in 1948," Daoud said. "I'm worried that something will happen to them if they stay, but they feel comforted that they are at least at home." Though Nahr al-Bared residents - both those in Beddawi and those who remain in the camp - are increasingly vulnerable, with memories of the razing of the Tal al-Zaatar still fresh in their minds, another Nakba - as the catastrophe of 1948 is called - is a fate far worse than violence or living in a temporary shelter, said the head of Hamas for North Lebanon, Abu Rabih al-Chehabi. "After the Nakba of 1948, many Palestinians decided never to leave their homes again out of fear they might not return," he said. "The 20,000 people who stayed in Nahr al-Bared remember what happened then." Tags: Children, Oman, Palestinian Send to a friend Save to My Web Your feedback is important to us!

But as Ron Corben reports from Bangkok, the party faithful have vowed to press on, raising fears of unrest. Thaksin Shinawatra react verdict in London, 30 May 2007 Thaksin Shinawatra, now living in London, called for Thailand's military and government to hold general elections soon. He also urged Thai Rak Thai Party members to accept the constitutional tribunal's verdict. Late Wednesday, the constitutional tribunal ordered the party Mr. Thaksin set up in 1998 to be dissolved. The judges banned more than 100 of its executives from politics for five years. Thai Rak Thai or Thai Love Thai Party, was found guilty of election violations and bribery during the inconclusive April 2006 general election, which was later annulled. Jakrapob Penkair, who had served as a Thaksin government spokesman, said the former prime minister considers the verdict too harsh. "Khun [Mr.] Thaksin expressed deep regret that the result has come this way. He himself said that it should not have been this severe. It is up to the [party] members in Thailand itself to fight for rights," said Penkair. "All I can say is that members of Thai Rak Thai will not lay down and take it." Jakrapob accuses the tribunal of issuing a political rather than legal verdict. Party officials say they will appeal. Mr. Thaksin's government was widely popular in rural areas, but was increasingly unpopular among the middle class. After nearly a year of anti-Thaksin protests in Bangkok, the military ousted Mr. Thaksin last September and appointed an interim government, which filed election fraud charges against both his Thai Rak Thai party and the leading opposition group. The government has heightened security around the country. Protests against the verdict are expected in the northeastern provinces, which are Thai Rak Thai strongholds. In Bangkok, party supporters planned a rally Thursday. The Democrat Party, which the tribunal cleared of election fraud charges, called for reconciliation. Media reports and political analysts say the ruling leaves the Democrats in a stronger position when elections are eventually held. The military and the interim government have said elections will be held after a new constitution is drafted, probably before the end of the year. Chulalongkorn University professor Somphob Manaragsan says the verdict should help the country move forward. "There is some clearer picture of the Thai political economic development after one of the deadlocks has been broken through," said Manaragsan. "I think that was a very important step." Somphob also says the public generally considers the tribunal to have been a legitimate way to resolve conflict in the country. But he doubts its verdict will end Mr. Thaksin's political aspirations. Other analysts say party members believe the tribunal discriminated against them, raising fears that deep political divides will remain.

Earlier Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has pledged his support for any military decision to stage an incursion into Iraq, said the army had not yet asked parliament for permission.

Yasar Buyukanit said he had asked for approval during a news conference on April 12, when he said "an operation into Iraq is necessary." "We have told both Turkey and the world on April 12 that as soldiers, we are ready," Buyukanit said Thursday. Buyukanit's remarks appeared to put Erdogan's government under pressure to seek approval from parliament to send soldiers into Iraq to fight separatist Kurdish guerrillas. The rebels have long used northern Iraq as a base in their campaign for self-rule in southeast Turkey. The United States opposes any unilateral Turkish military action, fearing it could destabilize northern Iraq _ the calmest part of the country. Massoud Barzani, the leader of the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq, also strongly opposes a Turkish incursion and has threatened to confront Turkish soldiers if they enter northern Iraq. Military trucks hauled more tanks and guns to the border area Thursday, local reporters said. For weeks, TV stations have broadcast images of military trucks rumbling along the remote border, and trains transferring tanks and guns to bolster an already formidable force in the area. The U.S. State Department said Wednesday that it has seen nothing to substantiate reports of a significant movement of Turkish military forces to the border. Buyukanit said the government needed to define the political targets of such an operation, referring to Barzani. "Political authorities will determine the targets," Buyukanit said. "Are we going to struggle with the PKK once we enter there or do something with Barzani too?" he said, referring to the main Kurdish separatist group.

The U.S. has led a campaign to isolate Iran to dissuade it from building nuclear weapons. Iran, which says it is enriching uranium for peaceful purposes, triggered a new round of talks over further penalties last week by failing to comply with demands made by the United Nations Security Council in March. ``Should Iran continue not to heed the call of the Security Council, we shall support further appropriate measures as agreed,&#39;&#39; German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said today on behalf of the G-8 after a meeting of foreign ministers in Potsdam, Germany. The last set of sanctions included a freezing of assets of a state-owned Iranian bank, limits on arms sales and the imposition of penalties on some military commanders. The European Union&#39;s foreign policy chief is set to hold his second meeting in just over a month with Iran&#39;s top nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, in Madrid tomorrow, a day before Rice arrives in the Spanish capital for meetings there. ``We remain committed to a negotiated solution which would address the international concerns over Iran&#39;s nuclear program and are united in our commitment to see the proliferation implications of Iran&#39;s nuclear program resolved,&#39;&#39; Steinmeier said in the statement. G-8 heads of state and government will discuss the matter further at a summit next week in the resort town of Heiligendamm, Germany. Rice now faces the task of persuading Russia and China to back tougher sanctions at the UN Security Council, where they wield veto power along with the U.S., Britain and France. The effort may be made more difficult by squabbling between Russia, on one side, and the U.S. and Western Europe, on the other. Russia objects to a U.S. plan to base interceptor missiles in Poland and a related radar system in the Czech Republic as a line of defense against any future missile strike from Iran. Russian President Vladimir Putin has characterized the so-called missile shield as a threat to Russia. Rice, noting that Putin said yesterday that Russia&#39;s ballistic missiles ``can destroy any missile shield we might build,&#39;&#39; added: ``We agree.&#39;&#39; Speaking at the same press conference, Lavrov shot back: ``I hope that nobody has to actually prove that Condi&#39;s right about that.&#39;&#39; A senior State Department official later told reporters that Russia couldn&#39;t assert that its ballistic missiles could overcome the interceptors planned by the U.S., while also saying the shield poses a threat to its deterrent. On Kosovo, the U.S. and European partners are seeking to pass a plan on Kosovo&#39;s future status by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari through the Security Council. The U.S. has said that delaying Kosovo&#39;s independence risks igniting a new war in the Balkans, while Russia backs Serbia&#39;s stance of offering broad autonomy. ``This is an issue on which our positions are diametrically opposed,&#39;&#39; Lavrov said. ``At the moment I don&#39;t see any chance of the positions moving toward each other.&#39;&#39; As German Foreign Minister Steinmeier tried to end the press conference, Rice unexpectedly interrupted to announce a July 1-2 meeting between Putin and Bush in Maine. In a bid to end things on a lighter note, Rice challenged Lavrov to correctly pronounce ``Kennebunkport,&#39;&#39; the oceanside Maine town where the meeting will be held and where President George W. Bush&#39;s family vacations. Lavrov, a fluent English speaker, did so, and added that the Kennebunkport meeting would be an opportunity for the two leaders to discuss all the areas on which they ``do not agree.&#39;&#39; On the sidelines of the G-8 foreign ministers meeting in Potsdam, members of the Middle East peacemaking body known as the Quartet urged Palestinians to resume a cease-fire. Israel has been pummeled by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip in recent weeks and has responded with military attacks that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said today would continue. The Quartet principals included Rice, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and European Commissioner for External Relations Benita Ferrero- Waldner. The group announced they would travel to the Middle East next month to meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders and with representatives of the Arab League.

Kate and Gerry McCann broke down in tears before being comforted by Benedict XVI at the Vatican. The couple, both Catholics, said they hoped their meeting would help in the search for four-year-old Madeleine and that it had made them stronger. They met the Pope after attending his weekly general audience in St Peter's Square with more than 35,000 people. As they waited to speak to the Pope, the tears fell from Kate - who was clutching black rosary beads and her missing daughter's favourite toy, Cuddle Cat. When their time came, the Pope took Kate's hands and then Gerry bowed his head and kissed his hand. The couple, in dark suits, had a few words with the Pope before he blessed a photograph ofMadeleine. Kate showed him another picture of Madeleine alongside two-year-old twins Sean and Amelie. A clearly moved Pope then put his arm around Kate and gave her five rosary beads. The couple both wore green and yellow ribbons - symbols of hope in Portugal where Madeleine vanished during a holiday in Praia da Luz on May 3. Kate said later: "He was very kind and sincere. He said he would pray for us and our family and that he continued to pray for Madeleine's safe return to us. "I thanked him for letting us meet him and I thanked him for his prayers. It was a lovely day. "It was a very positive experience. I think it has only made us stronger and lifted us up more." During the ceremony, a red admiral butterfly landed on the yellow ribbon in Kate's hair, she said. It flew off then settled on her lapel. Kate said: "It was really strange but lovely, it was like a symbol of hope." Gerry said: "Meeting the pontiff was an experience that had very mixed emotions for us. In ordinary circumstances, it would be a highlight for any Catholic to meet the Pope. "But, of course, it was saddened by the very marked realisation that our daughter is still missing. "We know people everywhere are praying for our daughter and that helps us sustain our belief that we can get her back safely. "It was more personal than I could ever have imagined. There was recognition immediately when he looked at Madeleine's photo. "His touch and thoughts and words were more tender than I could have thought. That will help sustain us through this most difficult time." During the two-hour service before they met Benedict, Kate and Glasgowborn Gerry began crying when a priest said a prayer on behalf of the Pope. It read: "In a special way, his blessing goes to your children and loved ones." The couple's sad appearance was at odds with traditional scenes of celebration in the square. As the McCanns left, clergymen applauded them. Gerry said later: "One evil act, the abduction ofMadeleine, seems to have generated so much good. It has restored my faith in humanity. The couple, of Rothley, Leicestershire, are due to visit Spain, the Netherlands, Morocco and Germany to raise awareness of her disappearance. Gerry said: "We're still in the middle of a race but we do not know how long it is going to be. "We had the same feeling as though Madeleine had died - anguish, despair and torment. But Madeleine is not dead." Kate added: "The first 72 hours were the worst for both of us. It was hard at that point to get away from the dark places. "But as time goes on the support we've had and the prayers give us strength and hope. We are more positive." Kate said it was difficult when their twins Sean and Amelie - who stayed with family in the Algarve while their parents went to Rome - ask about their big sister. She said: "We do not want them to be upset about what has happened but we don't want them to forget her. "She could just walk back through the door. But as the days go on it becomes more difficult." The couple flew to Rome from Portugal on Top Shop tycoon Sir Philip Green's private jet. Postal unions across Europe yesterday asked delivery workers to be vigilant for Madeleine. He said that he continued to pray for Madeleine's safe return to us' function newPrintableWindow(objectid,path) { popUpWindow = window.open(path+'?objectid='+objectid+'&siteid=66633', 'Article', 'width=450,height=500,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,location=no,menubar=yes'); popUpWindow.focus(); } Email to a friend

The U.S. military said only one policeman was killed and eight were wounded. U.S. forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al-Qaeda gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. The American military also reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed Wednesday in a roadside bombing in Baghdad and one who died of wounds from a roadside bomb attack northwest of the capital Tuesday. At least 122 American forces have died in May, the third-deadliest month of the Iraq conflict. U.S. forces also continued a search for five Britons who were kidnapped Tuesday in Baghdad, as well as for two of its soldiers who have been missing since a May 12 ambush south of the capital. The Fallujah suicide bomber killed at least 10 policemen in the attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. The rest of the dead were civilians, many of them in line seeking jobs as policemen. He said as many as 50 were wounded. Fallujah General Hospital had received 15 bodies and 10 wounded, according to a doctor there, who would not allow the use of his name because he feared retribution. The physician said he believed other casualties were taken to the nearby Jordanian Hospital and private clinics. A member of the Fallujah city council, who also asked for anonymity for fear of attack by insurgents, said there were at least 20 killed and 25 injured. The coordination of information in Fallujah was particularly difficult because the mobile telephone system has been working only sporadically. Maj. Jeff Pool of the Multi-National Force-West said the Anbar province governor's office and the provincial police put the total number of dead at one Iraqi policeman, with six police and two civilians wounded in Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated explosives in his vest at the third of four checkpoints, standing among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only opened Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The U.S. military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaeda. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of Sunni insurgents and al-Qaeda throughout the war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents called for U.S. help. Members of al-Qaeda, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final exams, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from al-Qaeda. Clashes continued into the afternoon, and the council official said the al-Qaeda leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the U.S. military. U.S. forces, meanwhile, pressed on with the search for five kidnapped Britons, and a procession of mourners, some of them women wailing and beating their chests, marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a U.S. helicopter strike before dawn. The U.S. military said it had no report of airstrikes in Sadr City and that there were no civilian casualties in the second day of a search for the Britons, who were abducted Tuesday from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad. A U.S. military statement, however, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. AP Television News videotape from Sadr City showed the coffins of the victims atop a small bus with men and women walking behind, crying. A young boy could be seen sitting next to the coffins. A car in the area was punctured with big holes, as if hit by an airstrike. A police officer in Sadr City, who refused to allow use of his name because he feared retribution, said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 a.m., killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home &#8212; a common practice in Iraq's extreme heat through late spring and summer. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was wounded. Also in Sadr City raids, which the U.S. has been conducting with a select unit of Iraqi army forces, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi claimed his home was raided and ransacked by American forces at 3 a.m. Thursday. The military said it had no report of the incident. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. Dozens of U.S. Humvees and Bradley fighting vehicles had taken up positions around Sadr City at nightfall Wednesday. The five kidnapped Britons included four bodyguards working for the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld and one employee of BearingPoint, a U.S.-based management consulting firm. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. The Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaeda front group, claimed responsibility. Wiggins also said that more than 100 patrols a day were being launched to search for two missing troops who vanished after a May 12 ambush near Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. Four Americans and one Iraqi soldier were killed in the attack and the body of another American was later found in the Euphrates River. "Our determination and resolve to locate our missing soldiers is unwavering," Wiggins said. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Originally submitted May 11, the Kosovo draft resolution based on the plan by UN envoy Marti Ahtisaari to grant the Albanian-dominated region independence is backed by the United States and the European Union, but has met strong opposition from Serbia and Russia. The UN Security Council is set to hold consultations, including on a new draft resolution on Kosovo, Alejandro Wolff said without specifying what concessions were made by the authors of the earlier draft. Speaking at a news conference following a foreign ministerial meeting of the Group of Eight countries in Germany Wednesday, Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated that the solution should be based on a compromise between Kosovo and Belgrade and urged compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244. Adopted in 1999, Resolution 1244 determined to resolve the grave humanitarian situation in Kosovo and to provide for the safe and free return of all refugees and displaced persons to their homes, a requirement still far from being fulfilled. Kosovo, which has a population of two million, has been a UN protectorate since NATO&#39;s 78-day bombing campaign against the former Yugoslavia ended a war between Serb forces and Muslim Albanian separatists in 1999. While the Albanians have since demanded full independence, the sizeable Orthodox Serb minority has complained that their lives and holy places would be at risk under the proposed setup. Russia is a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, but Lavrov said he did not expect a veto would be necessary for the UN Security Council resolution on Kosovo.

Photo: Emilio Morenatti/AP A British soldier was among at least seven Nato troops killed when a helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan last night in an attack that appears to have prompted a bloody retaliation by Nato today. Nato said other troops rushing to the scene were ambushed and had to call in air support "to eliminate the enemy threat". Today the Afghan defence ministry claimed that dozens of Taliban were killed and wounded in a Nato raid in southern Helmand, close to where the helicopter came down. Earlier officials said seven soldiers had been killed in the helicopter - its five-strong US crew, plus its two military passengers, a Canadian and a Briton. Nato said the CH-47 Chinook may have been brought down by the Taliban but the cause was "being determined by military officials". Major John Thomas, a spokesman for Nato's international security assistance force, said: "It was a hostile area where the helicopter went down and initial indications are that enemy fire may have brought down the helicopter." The Taliban said it had carried out the attack, and claimed that 35 Nato troops had been killed. Taliban spokesman Qari Muhammad Yousuf said the death toll had been drawn from secret sources operating in Helmand. Speaking to Reuters, he said: "Mujahideen planned to ambush their convoy. But the helicopter appeared before the arrival of the convoy. The mujahideen fired on it with whatever they had." Initial reports suggested the helicopter had been hit with a rocket-propelled grenade. There were no survivors. The fact that it was flying at night suggested the aircraft might have been carrying troops on a night-time air assault. The Taliban spokesman claimed that militants had shot the helicopter down in the Kajaki district of southern Helmand. Kajaki is the site of a large US-funded hydroelectric dam now being repaired so it can provide electricity to the southern city of Kandahar. British troops, who make up the bulk of the forces in Helmand province, have been engaged in fierce fighting around the dam. The latest British death brings the toll of fatalities among British forces personnel in Afghanistan since the start of operations in November 2001 to 58. Of these, 34 were killed in action, while 23 are known to have died either as a result of illness, non-combat injuries or accidents. The Ministry of Defence this week named Corporal Darren Bonner as the soldier killed on Monday when an explosion hit a British convoy in the Gereshk region of Helmand province. The CH-47, a heavy transport helicopter with two rotors, can carry around 40 soldiers plus a small crew. Maj Thomas said the wreckage of last night's crash remains on the site, which has been secured by Nato troops. "There will be a full investigation," he said. "We will try to determine everything that happened and to fully investigate the site." The MoD confirmed that a British soldier had been killed and that the next of kin are being informed. There are more than 3,000 British soldiers currently serving in Afghanistan. The Nato force, which is responsible for a countrywide counter-insurgency campaign, has 37,000 soldiers, including a 14,000-strong US contingent. There have been a number of helicopter crashes in Afghanistan since 2001. A Chinook crashed in February in the southern province of Zabul, killing eight US personnel. Officials ruled out enemy fire as the cause. In May 2006, another Chinook crashed attempting a night-time landing on a small mountain top in eastern Kunar province, killing 10 US soldiers. In 2005, a US helicopter crashed in Kunar, after apparently being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, killing 16 US personnel.

It is an almost unutterable message to Kate and Gerry McCann, but I feel I must say it before it is too late: "Please, please, for your own sake and the sake of your missing daughter Madeleine, step off this speeding juggernaut of publicity for just a second. Be still for one moment and think about what you are doing, about where you go next." I realise that just writing those words leaves me open to howls of protest, to accusations of callousness and insensitivity. The Pope's words of comfort for Madeleine's weeping parents Kate and Gerry McCann meet the Pope in Rome What mother or father in their situation could think of anything but getting their child back? Who could pause when every second might make the difference? But hear me out. Like millions of people, each night my first prayer is for Madeleine’s safe return. My second is for Kate and Gerry McCann, to give them the strength to endure the horror that has befallen them. Any parent would move heaven and earth to try to find their missing child. If that means shouting Madeleine’s name in every corner of the globe, then the McCanns have made it plain they will do so. To that end, they have helped orchestrate a publicity campaign to keep their daughter’s face in the forefront of the public’s mind, to maximise public support. The McCanns with twins Sean and Amelie And herein lies the danger. For I cannot help but question whether a new heart-rending, eye-catching initiative day after day is the right way to go about things. Especially when it means exposing even the most intimate moments of family despair. Moments like the one on Tuesday night, when they kissed goodbye to their two-year-old twins, Amelie and Sean, before flying off for their audience with the Pope. Not for one second do I doubt their motives — and Pope Benedict’s support is both moving and laudable. All the McCanns want is to get Madeleine back, whatever it takes, however long it takes. And yet, and yet me be clear: I do not agree with those — and there are a surprising number — who blame the McCanns for leaving their three children alone in that apartment in the first place. As Gerry McCann said, no one will ever blame them more than they blame themselves. What use is blame now anyway? Blame won’t get Madeleine back. Mummy and Daddy say goodbye to their children before setting off to meet the Pope But I do feel that the McCanns’ sustained public agony is so intense it is becoming almost unwatchable — thereby destroying its very purpose. None of us can imagine the full extent of the torment they are going through, day after day, as hope grows dimmer and desperation fades toward grief. But this I do know: the McCanns cannot be in a fit state to make rational judgements about what they are being asked to do. If someone told them that cutting off their arms would bring Madeleine back, they’d do it. And I do wonder about the people who are advising them. As the former Secretary of State for International Development Clare Short once remarked during coverage of famines in Africa, there is such a thing as compassion fatigue: the point at which the suffering is so great, people can no longer watch it, let alone respond to it. Madeleine McCann has been missing since May 3. "Despondency paralyses the will to action," she said, and that is as true of the missing Madeleine as it is of the starving millions. Having spoken to Scotland Yard experts on child abduction days after Madeleine went missing, I am well aware that in the beginning, it was crucial to keep her face on television and in newspapers. The courage it took for the McCanns to do that is unimaginable and I have nothing but the deepest admiration for them. Even their language in the first press conferences, saying how much Madeleine needed them and they needed Madeleine, was bravely scripted to try to trigger the response in her kidnapper to let her go. Then to have to trawl through pictures and video footage of their daughter to find the images that might jolt a witness’s memory — a fresh picture every day — must have been utterly heartbreaking. But then the Madeleine bandwagon began to roll and other people started falling over themselves to leap aboard. It’s one thing for the pop group Simple Minds to allow their hit single Don’t You Forget About Me to be played at football grounds to raise awareness in the first days after Madeleine’s disappearance. But when I heard two weeks later that Bryan Adams was considering allowing the re-release of his 1991 single, Everything I Do (I Do It For You) to help continue the campaign, I found myself wondering: was this good for Madeleine, or good for Mr Adams’s fading career? And whereas I have no doubt whatsoever about Gordon Brown’s motives — he of all people would understand the searing pain of losing a daughter — his much-publicised personal intervention leaves him open to charges at worst of political opportunism and at best of clumsiness. I hesitate to use such a phrase, but it seems, at times, as if we are witnessing "competitive grieving", with the McCanns’ private agony becoming a public sport. It’s not that Madeleine does not deserve special attention. Indeed, I wish every child who goes missing — hundreds in Britain and Europe every year, thousands in Africa and Asia — got that special treatment. No, the real problem now for the McCanns is that the public at large will grow weary of these orchestrated photo opportunities, and cynical about the parade of well-meaning celebrities who have offered their support. And then what? Only yesterday I saw a group of women gossiping over the papers when one saw the headline about Kate McCann’s trip to see the Pope. It read: "I have never left my twins before." The woman threw the newspaper down and said "If only that were true" — clearly referring to the night Madeleine went missing. One of her friends said she found the pictures of Kate and Gerry tearfully hugging the twins farewell in the full glare of the cameras disconcerting. "Is nothing private any more?" she asked. "Will it be a spread in Hello! next?" Callous, certainly, but also a reflection of how the public’s sympathy cannot be taken for granted: the weight of the tragedy is beginning to become unbearable to all those people who have, until now, joined in the prayers and the yearning for Madeleine’s story to have a happy ending. How will people react, I wonder, to the news that after yesterday’s trip to the Vatican, the McCanns will embark on a highly public trip around Europe? Once again, I understand why they feel they must keep Madeleine in the headlines, but they have to keep the public with them, too. And unfortunately they cannot do that by increasingly desperate and occasionally voyeuristic coverage of their pain. Look again at the pictures of Kate and Gerry with the Pope: they appear beyond exhaustion, so frail and stretched with suffering they seem ready to snap. Surely they need to take stock, to preserve their sanity, if not for their own sakes then for the sake of two adorable children who remain their most precious hope of happiness in these dark and desperate weeks. 58 people have commented on this story so far.

There is a lot of sense in this article but I wonder if, apart from the obvious desperation to find Madeleine there is the terror of how they would cope when all this publicity and furore is over and Madeleine has still not been found. - Barbara Wadsworth, Clitheroe, Lancashire, England Ms Platell, you and I might be castigated, but I believe you have hit the right note and have said much of what I feel over this situation. Saturation coverage leads to overload fatigue and whilst I respect the wishes of the McCanns to maintain this very high profile I do not believe it is achieving a great deal. - Ken, Suffolk, England Your email address will not be published make text area bigger Remember me - this will save you having to type out your name, location and email address when you next leave a comment.

EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana on Thursday urged greater flexibility from Iran in the growing row over its nuclear programme, but Tehran remained defiant ahead of key talks in Madrid. Solana "is asking the Iranians to show flexibility during the meeting today," his spokeswoman Cristina Gallach said before Solana met here with Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani. Earlier, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had also called on Iran "to change tactics" from its persistent defiance of UN Security Council demands to suspend uranium enrichment work, which Washington charges is part of a covert nuclear weapons programme. "The international community is united on what Iran should do and that is to suspend; to demonstrate that it is in fact not seeking a nuclear weapon under cover of civil nuclear power," Rice said in Vienna. Rice repeated Washington's offer to join multiparty talks on trade, security and technological benefits for Iran if the Islamic state halted the enrichment work. Thursday's meeting in Madrid will be the second between Solana and Larijani in just over a month after a fruitless head-to-head in Turkey in late April. It is also their first encounter since the expiration of a 60-day time limit set by the United Nations for Iran to stop enriching uranium, a process which can be used both to make nuclear fuel and, in highly purified form, the fissile core of an atomic bomb "This is a very difficult issue, the questions are very sensitive but a maximum effort must be made so that formal negotiations can start. For that to happen Iran must respect the Security Council resolutions," said Gallach. Oil-rich Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons, saying it wants only to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out. The meeting in Madrid has only a slim chance of achieving any breakthrough, with Tehran showing no sign of buckling under increasing international pressure. "There is no possible path for the suspension of the enrichment of uranium," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said Thursday. "Iran will use all legal and judicial means to realise its legitimate rights and will not halt its nuclear activities," Hosseini added. And Larijani, speaking before flying to Madrid on Wednesday, had said that suspending enrichment was "not a logical way" to resolve the nuclear issue. Foreign ministers from the Group of Eight most industrialised nations said Wednesday that they were prepared to back "appropriate measures" if Iran failed to change its stance. The US is leading calls by Western powers for existing sanctions on Iran to be tightened. The UN Security Council first imposed sanctions on Iran in December for rejecting its demands, and then modestly increased them in March. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- China, Britain, France, Russia and the United States -- are growing increasingly frustrated and are determined to see the punitive measures strengthened, an analyst said. "Iran would be deceiving itself to believe that they won't," said Mark Fitzpatrick, senior fellow for non-proliferation at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London think tank. "They will give Iran a chance to come to the bargaining table with something to offer, but if Iran does not budge, additional sanctions will surely be imposed."

The announcement came amid a slowdown in violence after two weeks of fighting between Palestinian rocket squads and Israeli forces. The fighting is expected to dominate the agenda of next week's meeting between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.

Two Palestinians traveling in a car in the northern West Bank were killed in an explosion Wednesday night, Palestinian security officials said, adding that the cause of the blast was not known. The violent Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades group, linked to the Fatah organization, said the two men were its militants and blamed Israel for the incident, but the Israeli army said it had no report of any military activity in the area.

VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article "The president is working night and day for a mutual, comprehensive cease-fire," said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a top aide to Abbas. Abu Rdeneh said next week's summit, scheduled for June 7, "is expected in the Palestinian territories." Officials would not say where, but in the past they have mentioned the West Bank oasis of Jericho as the likely venue. While the two leaders have held a series of meetings over the past year, the Palestinians haven't hosted any of the gatherings. Olmert's spokeswoman, Miri Eisin, said a West Bank meeting is "a possibility," but said the date and location still have not been finalized. Olmert and Abbas promised Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in March to meet every two weeks with the aim of moving beyond day-to-day issues and begin discussing the outlines of a final peace agreement. However, the men have met just once since then, in April, and next week's talks will focus on the fighting. A five-month truce in Gaza unraveled earlier this month when the Hamas militant group began firing barrages of rockets into southern , prompting Israel to respond with a series of airstrikes. More than 50 Palestinians, most of them militants, and two Israeli civilians have been killed. In the latest violence, Israeli aircraft attacked a Palestinian rocket-launching squad in northern Gaza. No injuries were reported. "We will actively pursue and hit these rocket launchers as well as those who operate them," said David Baker, an official in Olmert's office. Despite the flareup, there were signs of a slowdown in fighting. Hamas' military wing, which has been responsible for most of the recent rocket fire, said it has not launched a projectile in 48 hours. "Perhaps there is an unannounced cease-fire," Abu Rdeneh said. The smaller Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for Thursday's rocket fire. In a separate incident, Islamic Jihad said two members were slightly injured in an Israeli artillery strike.

The four-day ministerial talks are aimed at discussing reconciliation and joint economic projects, but struck a sour note over the hold-up in the badly needed food aid. The North's chief delegate Kwon Ho-Ung raised the matter when he met his southern counterpart, Unification Minister Lee Jae-Joung. "Our side reaffirmed our position and said we faced difficulties in implementing an agreement on our rice aid," said the South Korean delegation's spokesperson Ko Gyoung-Bin. "We told them there is no shift in the government's position." Ko said the South explained the reason for holding up the first shipment, which was supposed to be sent in late May. "We will try to solve it through further discussion." Asked if the dispute was impeding progress on other issues, Ko replied: "It's (too) early to say so." The South says it will not dispatch its first shipment until the North begins honouring a six-nation disarmament deal. The communist state says the two issues are unrelated and has urged the South to "keep its promise." At the first full session on Wednesday, South Korea reiterated appeals to the North to start closing its Yongbyon reactor, the first step in the disarmament agreement reached in February. The North refuses to move until a banking dispute with the United States is resolved. Kwon has blamed the United States for the delay. The South is also pressing for the gradual regular opening of two cross-border railway lines following a historic May 17 test run, and greater economic cooperation. To ease military tensions it proposes the resumption of talks between defence ministers, after the first and only meeting almost seven years ago. In a new sign of such tensions, the North's navy late Wednesday accused South Korea of infiltrating warships deep into North Korean waters across the disputed Yellow Sea border. "This is a serious military provocation creating a touch-and-go situation in those waters and an intolerable challenge to the high degree of patience and self-restraint exercised by KPA (North Korean) service persons," it said in a statement. The navy command said it would take "due measures" unless South Korea, which denied any incursions, stopped "reckless military provocations." At this week's talks the North has also taken the South to task for its joint military exercises with the US and urged it to repeal the tough anti-communist National Security Law. Relations between the two nations soured last year with the North's missile launches and nuclear test, but improved after the February nuclear deal. At the last ministerial round in March, the South agreed in principle to resume annual rice and fertiliser aid. But it delayed the first shipment of rice, out of an annual total of 400 000 tons, pending progress on nuclear disarmament. The North refuses to move until it receives $25-million (around R179-million) which had been frozen in a Macau bank under US-inspired sanctions. The US said the accounts were unfrozen in March but the North has had problems finding a foreign bank to handle the transfer. - AFP Car Insurance for Women USA Green Card Program Win Now For Real South Korea tears down fences Now you can get all your news - from politics in South Africa, the quirkiest stories in Step Beyond, the latest from the worlds of Motoring, Entertainment and Business - in one place. and you'll have all the latest news at your fingertips.

In comments likely to deepen a Russian-British feud reminiscent of Cold War spy scandals, Britain's chief suspect Andrei Lugovoy rejected Litvinenko's deathbed charge the Kremlin had ordered his poisoning with highly radioactive Polonium 210. At a packed news conference in Moscow, Lugovoy said he suspected MI6, the mafia and Boris Berezovsky, a multi-millionaire Kremlin critic who fled Russia for London, could have been involved in Litvinenko's murder. "The main role was played by British secret services and their agent Berezovsky," a confident and combative Lugovoy, himself a former KGB agent, told a news conference aired live on state television. "The poisoning of Litvinenko could not have been but under the control of British secret services," he said. Asked whether he had firm proof of British intelligence involvement in the murder, Lugovoy replied: "Yes". But Britain hit back by saying its request for Lugovoy's extradition from Russia -- which Moscow said it could not meet -- had nothing to do with MI6. "This is a criminal matter and is not an issue about intelligence," a Foreign Office spokesman said. "A British citizen was killed in London and UK citizens and visitors were put at risk." Looking tanned and dressed in a dapper pink shirt, Lugovoy said the Kremlin's enemies and the Western press were portraying him as a "Russian James Bond" in a campaign to tarnish Russia's image. &copy; Reuters 2007.

Japan beefs up whaling fleet for summer hunt in Antarctic Andrew Darby in Anchorage, Alaska JAPAN is modernising its whaling fleet ahead of this summer's Antarctic hunt, in what is seen as hard evidence of its quest to resume full-scale commercial whaling. A harpoon-equipped chaser boat was under construction to replace the last of the 1980s-style chasers still in service, Japan's Institute for Cetacean Research told the Also under consideration was a new factory ship to supplant the ageing and accident-prone Nisshin Maru, informed sources at the International Whaling Commission meeting said. The new chaser is the third in the Yushin Maru series of fast, highly manoeuvrable hunter/killer vessels to be built in the past six years. Costing a reported $16 million, it would add substantially to the whaling power at Japan's disposal as it tries to increase Antarctic kill by moving into larger species, taking 50 fin whales and 50 humpbacks in addition to the 935 minke whales on its list for the past two years. The 22-year-old Nisshin Maru caught fire for a second time in Antarctica last February, killing one crewman. It was speculated that the pressure to butcher large amounts of whale meat may have contributed to the blaze. The head of oceans campaigns for Greenpeace International, Shane Rattenbury, said new ships sent a signal that Japan was into whaling for the long haul. "This is a large-scale investment of capital, which takes 20 or 30 years to pay off." The Federal Environment Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was likely that ship-building would be underwritten by Japanese government subsidies. "This is the absurdity," he said. "You've got a heavily subsidised whale-killing industry resisting efforts to stop it, when these whales can generate an entirely self-sustaining whale-watching industry." send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today Japan beefs up whaling fleet for summer hunt in Antarctic Andrew Darby in Anchorage, Alaska Place a classified ad Copyright &#169; 2007.

'I think it's time for Iran to change its tactics' of defying UN resolutions to stop enriching uranium, Rice told reporters in Vienna. She was speaking as Iran's top negotiator Ali Larijani and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana were set to meet in Madrid in an attempt to lay the groundwork for international talks on Iran's nuclear ambitions. 'The international community is united on what Iran should do and that is to suspend, to demonstrate that it is in fact not seeking a nuclear weapon under cover of civil nuclear power,' Rice said at a press conference at a women's meeting in Vienna on the Middle East. Rice repeated the US position that if Iran stopped enriching uranium, which makes reactor fuel but also atom bomb material, the United States would be ready to join multiparty talks on trade, security and technology benefits for the Islamic Republic. 'If Iran is prepared to take that course, then we are prepared to change 27 years of American policy and sit with Iran to talk about whatever Iran would like to talk about,' Rice said. Iran is defying two rounds of UN sanctions imposed to get it to halt uranium enrichment. Iran claims it has a peaceful nuclear program and has the right to make nuclear fuel under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. But Rice said talks could not start 'when Iran continues to pursue, to try to perfect technologies that are going to lead to a nuclear weapon. 'So as I said to you before, the question isn't why won't we talk to Tehran, the question is why does Tehran not want to talk to us,' Rice said. Copyright AFX News Limited 2007. All rights reserved.

After emerging unscathed from the 1975-1990 Civil War, Lebanon's second most populated camp became a thriving entrepot thanks to its location on the coast midway between Tripoli and Akkar. Palestinian merchants purchased wholesale goods in bulk from Tripoli and sold them tax-free inside the camp, boosting the economic fortunes of Nahr al-Bared residents and retailers in the country's second largest city. "People in Nahr al-Bared were pretty well off. Traders from the camp came to Tripoli to buy goods and sell them in Nahr al-Bared, and there was a lot of trade with the surrounding areas until Fatah al-Islam came and the army surrounded the camp," the head of Hamas in North Lebanon, Abu Rabih al-Chehabi, told Nahr al-Bared was off the radar of most media outlets before Fatah al-Islam moved into the camp, but based on the accounts of residents displaced to Beddawi, everything from ceramic tiles, toilet bowls, and electronics to clothing, food, and cigarettes were sold at low prices on the bustling commercial strip. Though the majority of residents were relatively poor, said Suhail Natour, director of the Human Development Center,a Palestinian NGO, commerce had thrived in Nahr al-Bared for decades. "Nahr al-Bared was the only camp not damaged during the Civil War, so it was a converging point for the interests of wealthy traders in Tripoli and Palestinian merchants," he explained. "Since it had a small port on shore, it became a smuggling point for Syrian goods to Lebanon since the Civil War and remained so [until recently]." Natour said there has been a tacit agreement among the Lebanese, Palestinian, and Syrian authorities to maintain the status quo, allowing cheap Syrian goods to be smuggled into the camp by sea and sold duty-free, fueling Palestinian - and to a lesser extent Syrian and Lebanese - investment in Nahr al-Bared's economy. Commerce inside Nahr al-Bared dipped briefly when a highway between Akkar and Tripoli was constructed along the eastern border of the camp, but quickly rebounded when soe of the affected merchants moved closer to the highway. It was not until the army set up checkpoints around Nahr al-Bared three months ago and began restricting entry that the market began to suffer. "People from Akkar came to buy clothes, food, everything because it was cheaper in Nahr al-Bared, because there were no taxes. But then the army put up all these checkpoints, and it started taking a long time to get in and out of camp, so people stopped coming," displaced camp resident Fadi Moussa said. "No one wanted to spend an hour waiting to get inside." Most Tripoli merchants interviewed by The Daily Star all reported a fall in business when the army began to monitor Nahr al-Bared, and all said sales have plummeted since the fighting began. Qassem Mokheiber, the manager of the Tripoli Plaza clothing store, said that the Nahr al-Bared traders' bulk purchases were one of the store's main sources of revenue. "We were naturally affected when the army arrived," he told The Daily Star. "Tripoli was the main source for wholesale traders from Nahr al-Bared. They bought everything from us - clothes, toys, food," Mokheiber added. "We've had a few Palestinians displaced to Beddawi come in and buy clothes since the fighting started, but the business is meager compared to what we used to have. We're barely breaking even." Sales have dropped to just 10 percent of regular levels since the fighting between the Lebanese Army and Fatah al-Islam began more than a week ago, he estimated. Though the extent of infrastructure damage is still unclear, Natour doubts that any investors with capital will rush to rebuild Nahr al-Bared's economy in the absence of a sustained cease-fire. The Daily Star encountered a butcher and a barber who had already established temporary locations in Beddawi just two days after they fled Nahr al-Bared. "The fighting has totally demolished the camp's economy. Apparently the motive is security, but practically it has influenced the economic nerve center of Nahr al-Bared," said Natour. "Beddawi will be a temporary replacement, but not long term because smuggling was done through the sea."

Hariri: No ordinary murder Mark Seddon at the UN in New York Hariri supporters in Lebanon are hopeful, but the issue has exposed deep divisions [AFP] On face value, no politician or diplomat would be against prosecuting a serious crime, or bringing its perpetrators to justice. No politician or diplomat would ever say that it is acceptable to assassinate political opponents and then proceed to assassinate other key figures close to them. And yet, with a multitude of different agendas and principles whirling around, there are politicians and diplomats who are opposed to the setting-up of a UN International Tribunal to investigate the 2005 murder of Rafiq Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister, in a massive car bomb. But this was no ordinary murder, nor is this any ordinary tribunal. who abstained on Wednesday's resolution in the UN Security Council argued that they had good reason to do so. The resolution, supported by 10 countries, including the creates a precedent &#8211; although the UN might argue that it does not. It is a Chapter Seven resolution, which is invoked in cases of threats to international peace and security. It is binding, mandatory and can be backed by force if necessary. It gives the divided Lebanese parliament until June 10 to agree to the establishment of a tribunal. The massive car bomb attack in 2005 killed nine people, including Hariri [EPA] For the first time perhaps, an individual government, in this case the Lebanese government, will be forced to co-operate with a UN-backed court. Opinion is divided in too. The country&#8217;s president is against. The country&#8217;s prime minister is for. The opposition, official and unofficial is against. And yet the demonstrations marking Hariri&#8217;s murder two years ago were so massive, that the Syrian army, seen by some as occupiers, others as protectors, withdrew from much of the country. Throughout the long process of the Hariri Inquiry, presided over by a UN-backed team, countries and people not connected to the investigation have been pointing towards Syrian complicity in the attack on Hariri's motorcade, although this remains unproved. But for those who do believe that there was Syrian involvement, an international tribunal is seen as a device that may help make their cause. However, it remains the case that the forensic investigation of the murder site, where the massive car bomb exploded, have not yet led to any suspects being named. The Lebanese parliament now has a deadline. Yet already some are asking what the UN could do enforce its decision if the parliament fails to meet it, or for some reason does not agree. Others claim that this decision by the UN Security Council will lead to yet further violence and bloodshed. Many Lebanese people ask why their own country is not going to be allowed to run its own tribunal. Questions over Syria's involvement have yet to be answered [Reuters] Although others argue that given the great divides in Lebanese society, it is quite impossible to imagine their country hosting an investigation and criminal court case of such political magnitude. The United Nations, for its part, argues that there is no precedent; that there have been international tribunals in the former , investigating war crimes and in Once again critics say that had more or less ceased to exist as a state and wasn&#8217;t functioning as a state. Lebanon, on the other hand, despite its divisions and despite the terrible damage wrought by last year&#8217;s invasion by Israel, is a functioning state, and a state that cannot agree as to whether the tribunal is a good thing or not. The many supporters of Hariri are jubilant now that they believe that justice may actually be done. They believe that a line may at last be drawn under political assassinations if the perpetrators are brought to justice. But for others in , all of this reeks of outside interference. Others still believe that far from putting a cap on the violence, the creation of an international tribunal may just fuel it. Who is right and who is wrong, we shall see in the coming weeks and months.

Breaking news E-mail alerts Get breaking news in your inbox as it happens Spy killing suspect: Britain involved in plot By Jeffrey Stinson, USA TODAY LONDON &#151; The Russian businessman accused of killing former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko here last year denied any involvement on Thursday and said that British intelligence was likely to blame for the murder, perhaps because Litvineko was working with British agents and talking too much to others about it. Andrei Lugovoi, who was accused earlier this month of the murder by British prosecutors, made his sensational claim in a televised Moscow news conference that was broadcast live here. "Even if (British special services) hadn't done it itself, it was done under its control or connivance," Lugovoi said. He said he had evidence to substantiate his claim but didn't offer it. Lugovoi, a former Russian KGB agent too, also said: &#8226; British intelligence had sought to recruit him to provide "compromising information" on Russian President Vladimir Putin. &#8226; Litvinenko worked for British intelligence and may have done something to anger the service. &#8226; If British intelligence was not to blame for Litvinenko's death, then perhaps the Russian mafia or exiled Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky was. Berezovsky, who lives in London, was a friend and benefactor to Litvinenko. Berezovsky said that Lugovoi's press conference was proof that the Kremlin was behind the murder. "Everything about Mr. Lugovoi's words and presentation made it obvious that he is acting on Kremlin instruction," Berezovsky said in a statement. "If Mr. Lugovoi would like to prove his innocence, I suggest again that he travel to London and face trial in the (British) courts." But, Lugovoi insisted, he wasn't guilty of murdering Litvinenko, who died of poisoning from a rare radioactive isotope. "Britain is making me a scapegoat," he said. Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, has a policy of not responding to questions or commenting publicly. However, the Foreign Office brushed aside Lugovoi's allegations of British intelligence involvement. "This is a criminal matter and is not an issue of intelligence," the Foreign Office said in a statement from its press office. "A British citizen was killed in London, and (British) citizens and visitors were put at risk." Lugovoi said British agents were upset because Litvinenko bragged about his contacts with them. "In conversations with me, Litvinenko often &#8230; told me many things he shouldn't have said," Lugovoi said. "I got an impression that he was really getting out of British secret services' control. He believed that the British undervalued him and paid him too little for his service." Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of the Russian parliament, urged British authorities to help investigate "very serious accusations against British secret services." "I do believe they will take these new versions as seriously as it should be," Kosachev said on Lugovoi's accusations provide the latest twist in an intriguing murder case that has echoes of Cold War espionage and revenge, and which has reached the highest level of the Kremlin. It also has strained Anglo-Russian relations. And at one point, Litvinenko's radioactive poisoning prompted a widespread health alert in London and resulted in the grounding of three passenger jets. Litvinenko, 43, died from polonium-210 poisoning on Nov. 23 in a London hospital. He fell ill Nov. 1 after meeting with Lugovoi earlier in the day at London's Millennium Hotel near the U.S. Embassy. Lugovoi, now a Moscow businessman, said the meeting was about business that Litvinenko was helping him with. On his deathbed, Litvinenko accused Putin of being behind his death. Litvinenko had been a harsh Putin critic and a critic of Russia's involvement in Chechnya. He sought asylum in Britain in 2000 and later became a British citizen. Putin, also a former KGB agent, has dismissed Litvinenko's deathbed accusation, and the Kremlin has called it nonsense. Britain's director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, announced on May 22 that there was sufficient evidence to charge Lugovoi with Litvinenko's murder "by deliberate poisoning" Macdonald's accusation came after Scotland Yard detectives followed a trail of radioactive material across London, to Germany and to Russia. The radioactivity prompted the British Health Protection Agency to issue a public health alert in London after traces were found at a dozen sites across the city, including three hotels and a soccer stadium. It also prompted British Airways to alert thousands of passengers who might have been exposed to low levels of radioactivity aboard three jets. In Britain, 700 people were tested for polonium contamination, and 670 were tested abroad. All were eventually released. Britain has sought to extradite Lugovoi to Britain to be charged and tried for what Macdonald called "this extraordinarily grave crime." On Thursday, the Foreign Office said it still was awaiting Russia's response to the extradition request. "Our position is clear," the Foreign Office said in the statement. "A request for the extradition of Mr. Lugovoi to face trial in a (British) court has been handed over. We await the formal Russian response." It is unlikely that Lugovoi will be handed over. The Russian constitution prevents the extradition of a Russian citizen to a foreign country to face charges. Britain has not given any indication what the motive was behind Litvinenko's murder. Nor have prosecutors provided any details of how the poison was administered. The case has worsened Russia's relations with Britain and shined an unwelcome light on Putin, who has said he will step down as president next year.

Suspect Blames British For Spy's Death Litvinenko Died Of Poisoning By Rare Radioactive Isotope POSTED: 2:49 am PDT May 31, 2007 The Russian businessman whom Britain has named as a suspect in the killing of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko said Thursday that he has evidence of British special services' involvement in the poisoning death. "Even if (British special services) hadn't done it itself, it was done under its control or connivance," Andrei Lugovoi told a news conference. Asked if he had evidence for the allegation, he said "I have evidence" but did not elaborate. A British government security official, who demanded anonymity in exchange for discussing Lugovoi's claims because of the sensitivity of the case, said suggestions British intelligence had involvement in Litvinenko's death were spurious. Britain last week said it had enough evidence to charge Lugovoi, who also worked for the KGB and its main successor agency the FSB, in the November killing of Litvinenko. Litvinenko, who died of poisoning by the rare radioactive isotope polonium-210, had fled to Britain several years earlier after becoming a strong critic of the Kremlin and received British citizenship. Lugovoi and another Russian had met in London with Litvinenko on Nov. 1, the day Litvinenko said he became ill. Britain has requested Lugovoi's extradition, but Russia has refused, saying the constitution does not permit such extraditions. Lugovoi has repeatedly asserted he is not guilty in the matter. On Thursday, Lugovoi also claimed that Britain had tried to recruit him to provide intelligence. British special services "asked me to collect compromising information on President (Vladimir) Putin," Lugovoi said. Lugovoi said the attempted recruitment occurred during business trips to Britain in previous years. He did not give a precise date, but indicated the alleged approach occurred in late 2005 or early 2006. London's Foreign Office, responsible for the country's overseas secret intelligence service MI6, declined to comment on Lugovoi's claim. But another government official with knowledge of Lugovoi, who also demanded anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, said the allegations were untrue. . All rights reserved.

Brent Bozell III Frank J. Gaffney Jr. Phantom of the Movies Clicks and Mortar Column Dispatches from the Gulf The World & I Add To Insider Newsclips We regularly hear that the Bush administration has "missed" opportunities for engagement with Iran, as though Tehran is waiting in the wings to talk. If that were true, Iran would not be imprisoning, forcing false confessions from and otherwise seriously mistreating Iranian American activists, scholars and engagement advocates, all for political effect. The jailing of Haleh Esfandiari, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, on trumped-up espionage charges, should be a wake-up call for the "engagement" crowd -- and the same goes for similar charges leveled against three other American citizens in Iran. If Tehran is willing to imprison even congenial, pro-dialogue Westerners, then the message it intends is that it has zero interest in engagement. The Bush administration has not "missed" chances for dialogue. The 67-year-old Mrs. Esfandiari had been visiting her elderly mother when she was arrested three weeks ago by Iranian authorities. In a formal announcement, Iran acknowledged that it is holding Mrs. Esfandiari, reportedly in the notorious Evin prison, which is awful even by Iranian standards. The statement was timed to coincide with this week&#39;s unprecedented U.S.-Iranian bilateral talks on the security situation in Iraq. The charges against Mrs. Esfandiari allege a plot to destabilize the Islamic republic and otherwise harm Iranian national security. Iran is also holding Kian Tajbakhsh, a scholar at the New School for Social Research in New York City who has worked for the World Bank and for George Soros&#39; Open Society Institute. Mr. Tajbakhsh has consulted previously on development and urban planning projects with multiple arms of the Iranian government, including Tehran&#39;s social-security research center, its housing and urban development ministry and the municipality of Tehran. The third to be arrested is Parnaz Azima, a journalist for Radio Farda, the U.S. government&#39;s Persian-language radio service based in Prague and Washington. She has reportedly been interrogated, asked to collaborate with Iranian intelligence and has been told she cannot leave the country for two to three years. Also being held is mortgage-company businessowner Ali Shakeri, 59, a peace activist affiliated with the University of California-Irvine. Mr. Shakeri went to Iran to visit his ailing mother. Kayhan, the newspaper that speaks on behalf of Iran&#39;s clerical rulers, reportedly accused Mr. Shakeri of being a "CIA agent who has officially supported overthrowing the Islamic republic in interviews with opposition media and seeking to implement a secular state in Iran." All of the charges are spurious on their face. Each of the accused is a friend of the Iranian people, and all hold dual Iranian-U.S. citizenship. Mrs. Esfandiari is one of Washington&#39;s most visible engagement advocates -- the kind of person whom the regime would encourage if it were seeking accommodation and dialogue. Instead, it has placed her in its most notorious prison for enemies of the regime. It should now be obvious to even the most relentless engagement advocates that Tehran simply does not want engagement. Its history of hostage-taking is the record of a hostile regime, one whose character is unchanged over the years in its contempt for the West -- including its own defenders. That it would throw these congenial people in jail as a sideshow during the U.S.-Iran talks on Iraq is a telling indicator of that fact. Add To Insider Newsclips Want to use this article?

The Quartet called on Israel on Wednesday to use restraint and urged Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to do "everything to restore law and order", including the release of kidnapped BBC journalist Alan Johnston. The ministry said the statement "raised questions about the credibility of the Quartet as a neutral party" and would encourage Israel to continue attacks and the arrest of Palestinian ministers. "(The ministry) is surprised at the Quartet's lack of condemnation at Israel's kidnapping of the Palestinian parliament," it said in a statement. Egypt also said Israel's use of heavy weapons in attacks in civilian areas violated international law and the Geneva conventions. In the past week Israel has seized Palestinian Education Minister Naser al-Deen al-Shaer and another Hamas minister along with more than 30 other Palestinian officials. Hamas has said the Quartet statement "only served Israel" and made it party to the conflict. Comprising the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union, the Quartet announced plans on Wednesday for talks with the Israelis and the Palestinians at an undisclosed time and location in June as well as with the Arab League. news is provided by Zoom to full size map Facts & Figures - Human development index ranking (2004) INSTANT VIEW-Reaction to Bush on climate change FACTBOX-Security developments in Iraq, May 31 May toll for U.S. soldiers in Iraq climbs to 122 Israel, militants exchange limited fire in Gaza Soldier killed in Lebanon fighting Catholic Relief Services commends President's call to double PEPFAR funding Source: CRS - USA World Vision Lauds Bush Global AIDS Funding Proposal Source: WV - USA Gaza and West Bank &#8211; ICRC Bulletin No. 20 / 2007 Source: ICRC - Switzerland Displaced Palestinians receive First World Vision relief Source: WV MEERO - Cyprus Catholic Relief Services urges Congress to preserve US long-term development food aid initiatives that fight chronic hunger Source: CRS - USA Israeli tanks wait to cross into the northern Gaza Strip near Kibbutz Zikim May 31, 2007.

The insurgent Taliban movement said that its men shot down the Chinook in the southern province of Helmand late Wednesday. "We are able to say now that there may have been enemy fire in bringing down the helicopter," the Kabul media office for NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said. "It could be anything from small arms fire upwards." ISAF, which includes soldiers from 37 countries, will not release the nationalities of the dead soldiers, leaving this up to their home nations. The icasualties.org Web site, which charts casualties in the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, said that five of the dead were US nationals, but this was not confirmed by the US military here. Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi said late Wednesday that "our brothers in Helmand" had brought down the heavy transport helicopter. "The helicopter burst into flames in the sky and then crashed," he said, citing the local rebel cell that claimed to have to carried out the attack. The insurgents have made similar claims in the past but are only confirmed to have brought down one military aircraft in Afghanistan - in June 2005 when a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) shot down a Chinook in Kunar province. All 16 soldiers on board, eight of them US Navy SEALs, were killed. On Thursday Ahmadi said that he was still not clear how the helicopter was brought down. He also claimed that 35 foreign soldiers were killed, but the rebels usually inflate their tolls and their information is often unreliable. "The helicopter might have been shot down by RPG, other ordinary weapons, or by the new anti-aircraft weapons we have got now," Ahmadi said. "The group of 30 to 35 mujahideen [holy fighters] who carried out the attack have managed to leave the area sound and safe following the clash after the crash." ISAF said Wednesday that a unit that responded to the scene of the crash was ambushed. "Under continued fire, the responding patrol called for an airstrike to eliminate the enemy threat," it said. There have been suspicions that the militants, who are allied with Al Qaeda, are trying to acquire shoulder-fired anti-aircraft weapons for their fight against the NATO force and the separate US-led coalition. In March this year, the coalition said that it carried out precision airstrikes on Taliban militants who had been helping to move anti-aircraft weapons in Helmand, killing some of them. Helmand has seen a surge in military and Taliban activity. Hardcore Taliban are said to be allied with drugs barons and foreign fighters in the province, the country's top opium producer. The province is where the Afghan and foreign military forces said that they killed the Taliban's top military commander, Mullah Dadullah, this month in the military's biggest success against the movement. The rebels have vowed to avenge the commander's death.

South Korea urged communist North Korea on Wednesday to shut down its nuclear reactor and gradually open their heavily armed border to regular train traffic, amid a heightening standoff over the North's refusal to abide by a disarmament deal. (AP Photo/Jo Yong-Hak, Pool) SEOUL, South Korea -- The two Koreas will hold working-level military talks next week in the border village of Panmunjom, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said Thursday, amid fresh warnings from Pyongyang over disputed coastal waters. The talks will follow up on agreements reached at high-level military talks earlier this month, the official said on condition of anonymity, citing ministry protocol. At the earlier negotiations, the rival neighbors adopted a security agreement for a historic test-run of a train service across their heavily armed border. The test, which happened two weeks ago, marked the first time trains have crossed the tightly sealed border since the 1950-53 Korean War. During the discussions, North Korea also raised the issue of sea border disputes, and that issue was expected to play a key role in the new talks beginning June 8, after fresh warnings about a possible clash from North Korea. The North's navy command has warned that a skirmish along the disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea - the scene of deadly clashes in 1999 and 2002 - could occur unless Seoul stops entering the North's waters. On Wednesday, North Korea's Navy Command warned in a press release that its sailors were patrolling "with a high degree of vigilance," according to a dispatch carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency. "The reckless military provocations of the above-said warmongers pushed the situation in the waters off the West coast to such an extreme pitch of tension that a new armed clash may break out there any moment," it said. North Korea doesn't recognize the current sea border demarcated by the United Nations at the end of the Korean War, and has long claimed it should be further south. The waters around the border are rich fishing grounds, and boats from the two Koreas often jostle for position during the May-June crab-catching season. The earlier talks included two-star generals and were the first high-level military contacts between the two sides in a year. The announcement about next week's talks was made separately from ongoing Cabinet-level negotiations being held by the two Koreas in Seoul. Those talks are scheduled to end Friday and are aimed at various reconciliation efforts.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday "our positions are diametrically opposed and I don't see any chances of the positions moving any closer together". Russia has been opposing a draft resolution presented to the UN Security Council by the US and its EU allies, which would endorse a plan drawn up by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari for internationally-supervised independence for Kosovo. Attempts to bridge the gap on the draft resolution failed to make headway during talks that US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice held in Moscow in mid-May. Russia's publicly stated position is that a solution needs the approval of both parties. Mr Lavrov reiterated that point during a recent visit to Belgrade, after he met Serbia's President Boris Tadic. Russia's foreign minister wants more negotiations on Kosovo "Ultimate legitimacy can be reached through decisions that will be acceptable to both sides," Mr Lavrov said, "in this case, both for Kosovar Albanians and Belgrade". Since Serbia has rejected the Ahtisaari recommendations out of hand, that would imply that Russia might use its veto, as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, to scupper the proposed supervised independence for Kosovo. The United States and - more reluctantly - the EU have endorsed the Ahtisaari plan as the best one possible, in the absence of an agreement between Belgrade and Kosovo's overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian community. No such deal emerged from a year-long series of talks Mr Ahtisaari chaired in Vienna until March. Meanwhile, Western governments are hoping that Moscow's disapproval does not necessarily mean it will veto a UN resolution. Russia's most senior officials - including Mr Lavrov - have tended to avoid using the term "veto", while hinting at its possible use. That has been viewed as an attempt on the Kremlin's part to keep its options open. However, in recent months - particularly since the emergence of the Ahtisaari proposals - Russia has adopted a firmer position in arguing for a settlement reached by consensus. It has made fewer attempts to establish an analogy between Kosovo and the pro-Russian breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia. Last year President Vladimir Putin sought to highlight such a link, implying that if Kosovo gained independence, then so should these territories. Russia's opposition to the West over Kosovo does not appear to be motivated by a history of friendship with Serbia on grounds of a shared Slavic cultural background and Orthodox Christian heritage. After all, Russia pulled its peacekeepers out of Kosovo in 2003, despite the fact that the Serb minority there were complaining, as they still are, of being the victims of harassment and discrimination at the hands of the ethnic Albanian majority. Russia's early departure from Kosovo, justified on grounds of cost-cutting, was viewed by many Kosovar Serbs as leaving them in the lurch. The withdrawal from Kosovo four years ago was also in stark contrast with the unannounced arrival of Russian peacekeepers there back in 1999. The Russian dash to Pristina airport nearly produced a confrontation with the main body of the peacekeeping contingent under Nato's command which the Russian troops eventually joined, as originally agreed. Russia's conduct both in 1999 and today appears to be motivated by a determination to show the West, and the US in particular, that it should be taken seriously - as one of the key players on the international stage. The circumstances now are very different, though. Thanks to its oil wealth in an era of high energy prices, Russia believes it has regained its former status as a great power, which it lost during the economic collapse in the immediate post-communist era. Mr Ahtisaari failed to get a deal between Serbs and ethnic Albanians When it comes to the dipomatic battle of wills over Kosovo, that factor probably accounts for much more than Russia's sympathy for the Serbs - although support for fellow-Orthodox Serbs has a populist appeal to some sections of Russian society. The Kremlin might still decide to abstain in a vote - an option made easier by the fact that the text of the UN resolution, like the main section of Mr Ahtisaari's blueprint, does not include an explicit reference to "independence". Western diplomats also note that, until very recently, Russia played what they describe as a generally "constructive" role as a member - along with the US, Britain, France, Germany and Italy - of the six-nation Contact Group that has been spearheading the UN's drive to settle Kosovo's status. However, before the Kremlin reconsiders its stance it may be looking for some concessions, both on Kosovo and other issues. In the case of Kosovo, these could include a moratorium on the territory's membership of the UN and other international bodies once it becomes independent. Elsewhere, Moscow may be angling for an undertaking from Nato not to continue its enlargement into former Soviet republics by inviting Georgia, and possibly Ukraine, to join the alliance. Meanwhile, Washington has also signalled its readiness to bypass Russia, if necessary, by stating that it will recognise Kosovo's independence, even if there is no UN Security Council resolution in place to endorse it. Russia may want to avoid a confrontation of that kind, and it has repeatedly tried to put off the moment of decision by calling for more talks. But the US and key Western countries believe the time for further delays has passed. They are concerned about a build-up of frustration among Kosovo's Albanian majority - and unlike Russia, they have peacekeepers on the ground who may become the targets of possible violence. The last chance for a deal may now be just a few days away - at the G8 summit of leading industrial nations in Germany on 6-8 June. If Russia stands by Serbia, Kosovo's assembly will almost certainly vote for a unilateral declaration of independence. That would be a scenario for diplomatic upheaval and chaotic developments on the ground, which would present further challenges not only to the West but Russia as well.

Thu, 31 May 2007 THE WEEK IN REVIEW » All the stories from the past 7 days SA abstains from UN's 'Lebanon' vote Thu, 31 May 2007 South Africa abstained from voting on the United Nations Security Council proposal for a special tribunal to prosecute suspects in the assassination of former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafiq Hariri, said the department of foreign affairs on Wednesday. "South Africa as a matter of principle abstained on voting for the current resolution on Lebanon in the Security Council," said department spokesperson Ronnie Mamoepa in a statement. He said the South Afrrican government reiterated its strong condemnation of the assassination and called for the perpetrators to be brought to account. Mamoepa said while South Africa supported the need for a special tribunal for this, the government believed this should be "the product of consensus within Lebanon as required by the Lebanese constitution and not an imposition of the Security Council". He said imposing a tribunal would politicise international criminal law and thus undermine international law. "For South Africa, the key principle is that all violators of international law including international humanitarian law in Lebanon are brought to justice and not only those who perpetrate criminal acts against one faction within Lebanon." AP reported that the Security Council approved the resolution to establish the tribunal.

They took away five rosaries he had blessed, including one for Madeleine, and perhaps the most intense emotions they have experienced since the horror of learning, nearly a month ago, that their four-year-old had vanished. "This is something we will cherish for the rest of our lives," Mr McCann told one of the people escorting them away from the event. "It was more personal, more pastoral, than we could ever have thought." Mrs McCann had intended to give the pontiff a copy of the now famous photograph of her daughter. But the gift came back to her, spiritually charged. Benedict took it from her hands and rested his own hand on the girl's image for several moments in silence, then with his thumb made the sign of the cross on her face and handed the photograph back. "It was a very emotional but also a very positive experience really," she said a few minutes later, at a press conference. "It's very important for us. That photograph will stay with me now." "There was recognition immediately," her husband added. "And looking at Madeleine's photograph, his touch and his thought and his words were more tender than we could ever have hoped. That will help sustain us in this most difficult time." The dignified pursuit by the McCanns of their lost child has acquired an extraordinary momentum. It has become far more than the story of one little girl and two distraught parents. It has become an emblematic saga of love and faith tested in the fire of terrible misfortune and emerging stronger; it has become a sort of contemporary parable of the power of belief. The ease with which the encounter with the Pope was arranged is part of the developing fable. Kate McCann is a devout Catholic, and yesterday, her husband said that the huge response to their tragedy "has restored my faith - my Catholic faith but also my faith in humanity." But according to gossip in Rome yesterday, the idea of a Rome pilgrimage originated not with the McCanns but with the News of the World. The British paper phoned its Rome stringer, Nick Pisa, to ask if he thought a meeting between the couple and the Pope could be set up. Pisa made inquiries and the response from the Vatican was encouraging - by which time the newspaper had lost interest. But Pisa pursued it, with the help of the British embassy, and lo and behold, it came to pass. And although the couple's campaign has turned into a huge media event, their own simplicity and sincerity shine through untarnished. The McCanns have generated a sort of charisma around themselves and their determination. If faith and resolve have the sort of potency to which the couple bear witness, Madeleine will soon be found, safe and well. "There could be a breakthrough at any minute," Mr McCann told a room full of journalists in Rome. "There could be a call to say that Madeleine has been found. We have to continue believing. "Many, many thousands and tens of thousands of people are doing small things that may make a difference, and we take strength from that. Even the smallest things by the greatest number of people that will achieve the maximum in terms of publicity around Madeleine's disappearance." Last night they were back in the Algarve, but trips to Madrid, Berlin and Amsterdam - cities from which many tourists travel to the Algarve - are planned. "One of the worst feelings was helplessness," Mr McCann said. The campaign "makes us feel we are doing everything in our power".

Ten policemen were among the dead in the attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. Fallujah, in restive Anbar province, is 65 kilometers (40 miles) west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated his explosives vest at the third of four checkpoints as he stood among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only been opened on Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The U.S. military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a lose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaida.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Wife of Calif. Businessman Says Iran Is Holding Her Husband Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, May 31, 2007; 10:48 AM The wife of California businessman Ali Shakeri today appealed to the Iranian government for information on her husband, who has been missing since May 8, according to family members in Iran. Shakeri, a peace activist, is the fourth American citizen reported detained by Iran in recent weeks. The Iranian government has denied holding him. In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article Zohreh Shakeri said her husband called her three times from Tehran's notorious Evin Prison and asked her not to comment publicly on his situation. A family member in Tehran saw her husband at the prison two weeks ago and also was asked not to say anything publicly. But after 24 days of silence, Shakeri said she had decided to break her silence. "I need to know where my husband is. I'm devastated. I don't know what to do," she said in an interview today. She said she has not received a call from him since May 17. It is common for Iran to tell detainees to urge family members not to say anything about their detention, according to human rights groups. Shakeri, who graduated from the University of Texas in the 1970s, had returned to Iran to visit his mother, who was ill and died while he was there, his wife said. He was due to return on a flight May 8 but has not been seen since he went to the airport, according to friends and family. The activist group Human Rights Watch put out the first alert about him. Shakeri's appeal comes as a coalition of international human rights activists today called on Iran to immediately release two detained Iranian-Americans, clarify the status of Shakeri and lift the travel ban on a journalist who is a dual national. The coalition includes Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation for Human Rights, Reporters without Borders and Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian human rights lawyer. "These measures appear to be an attempt by Iran's security authorities to sow fear into the wider community of journalists, writers, scholars and activists," they said in a joint statement. "Their exchanges with counterparts in other parts of the world underscore both their commitment to enhance mutual respect and recognition of human dignity through dialogue and to see human rights norms upheld in their country." Shakeri, a resident of Irvine, CA, may be the victim of an "enforced disappearance," the statement staid. Also jailed in Iran are American scholar Haleh Esfandiari and social scientist Kian Tajbakhsh. The Iranian government also has refused to allow Parnaz Azima, correspondent for U.S.-funded Radio Farda, to leave the country since January. All three were charged Tuesday with espionage and endangering Iran's national security.

Quartet demands new PA gov&#39;t recognize Israel / Revived Quartet of Middle East peace negotiators underscore demand that any Palestinian government must recognize Israel. Quartet statement &#39;reaffirms commitment to meet regularly&#39; on Mideast situation The panel did not demand Israel end its military activity in the Strip, but urged Israel to exercise restraint to ensure that its security operations avoid civilian casualties or damage to civilian infrastructure in the Palestinian territories. The panel, comprised of the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union, also demanded the release of Hamas ministers and parliament members arrested by Israel over the past few weeks. Ban's statement came after the Quartet meeting in Berlin in which Ban himself, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, American Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the EU's Javier Solana , European Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy Benita Ferrero-Waldner and German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier were present. The Quartet expressed its concern of the tense internal situation in Gaza and urged the Palestinians to end all violence and honor the ceasefire. The panel also called on Palestinians to cooperate with President Mahmoud Abbas, and regional leaders in order to regain law and order in the Strip, which would bring about the release of kidnapped BBC reported Alan Johnston. The immediate and unconditional release of kidnapped IDF soldier Despite the deteriorating situation in the south, the Quartet members welcome continued dialogue between Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and urged the parties "to create an environment conducive to progress on the political horizon for Palestinian statehood." "Palestinians must know that their state will be be viable, and Israelis must know that a future state of Palestine will be a source of security, not a threat," the statement added. Alongside the demand that the Palestinian government recognize Israel and honor previous agreements, the Quartet reiterated its request that remove all illegal settlements and help improve the Palestinians' situation by opening crossings and removing roadblocks. Israel was also urged to transfer the seized Palestinian tax money to a temporary international body which would ensure the money reached the right bodies. The Quartet stated that this would lead to a real improvement in the situation. The statement further said that the Quartet welcomed the Saudi peace plan, and praised the Arab League's intention to cooperate with Jerusalem. The quartet said it planned to meet the Israelis and Palestinians next month as well as the Arab League in a bid to revive peace hopes further dimmed by a new round of violence.

That announcement came as diplomats from the two Koreas held talks in Seoul - where South Korea told the North it will send food aid when Pyongyang lives up to its promises on nuclear weapons. VOA's Kurt Achin has more from the South Korean capital. South Korea's Defense Ministry said Thursday that military officers from North and South will meet next Friday in Panmunjom. That village is where a 1953 armistice halted fighting, but did not formally end, the Korean War. The talks are expected to focus on preventing conflicts over the sea border. North Korean naval authorities this week announced they were patrolling the waters west of the Korean peninsula "with extra vigilance" and accused the South of "reckless military provocations." North Korea does not accept the sea border established by the United Nations in 1953, and has been involved in at least two deadly skirmishes at sea with the South since 1999. N. Korea's delegation head Kwon Ho Ung, left, talks with S. Korea's Unification Minister Lee Jae-joung during their dinner in Seoul, 31 May 2007 Separately, high-level diplomats from North and South held a second day of talks Thursday at a hotel here in Seoul. South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Koh Kyoung-bin told reporters that the North's delegates asked about a South Korean promise to ship 400,000 tons of rice to the impoverished North. Koh says South Korea's position about providing rice to the North has not changed - it is something that will be done on the basis of trust. He says North and South should work cooperatively to resolve what he calls "a difficult situation." North Korea has missed by nearly two months a deadline it agreed to earlier this year to begin dismantling its nuclear weapons programs. South Korea says the aid it promised was predicated on North Korea's implementation of that agreement, and says the shipment will be delayed until the North takes action. Pyongyang blames the delay on a banking issue involving the transfer of $25 million of its money from a bank in Macau. No international bank has been willing to handle the transfer since the U.S. Treasury Department announced the money was linked to illegal North Korean activities. North Korea says there will be no progress on the nuclear issue until the funds are returned. Senior South Korean and U.S. officials say the financial issue will be resolved soon.

The events surrounding the murders of five Australian newsmen in East Timor in 1975 have been obscured by a shameful combination of deceit, diplomatic compromise and political expediency. But a QC assisting a New South Wales coroner has this week recommended prosecution for war crimes of two un-named former Indonesian army officers. The prospect that someone may finally be held to account for the murders will bring joy to the families of the Balibo Five. But it will also send a shiver through the corridors of Foreign Affairs in Canberra, where maintaining a good relationship with Indonesia is a constant battle. The inquest into the death of Brian Peters has already resulted in a potentially explosive diplomatic incident. Jakarta's Governor Sutiyoso stormed out of Australia after two NSW detectives entered his Sydney hotel room and attempted to serve a summons for him to appear at the coronial inquest. Governor Sutiyoso is accused of being in Balibo in 1975 as the captain of a special operations unit, a charge he has denied. Our relations with Indonesia are extremely important, particularly in the fight against regional terrorism, and deft diplomatic footwork will be required by Foreign Affairs to ensure this issue does not sour relations with Jakarta. However, that does not mean that there should be any soft-pedalling on seeking the truth of what happened to the Balibo Five and if possible pursuing those who murdered them.

Cheering crowds in Beirut greeted the decision by the Security Council last night with flag waving and celebratory gunfire in the streets, but some Lebanese newspapers this morning echoed Syria&rsquo;s suggestion that a tribunal may cause even greater instability in the country. Hariri was killed by a truck bomb in February 2005, initial UN investigations implicated Syrian authorities in his murder. The dispute over Hariri&rsquo;s death is at the centre of a deep political crisis between the Western-backed government and the Syrian-backed opposition, led by Hezbollah. There has been no official reaction from Hezbollah to the UN resolution, but the pro-opposition al-Akhbar newspaper said setting up the court without consensus &ldquo;raises serious concern for security and stability&rdquo;. Q&A: explaining the violence in Lebanon Lebanon Army battles &lsquo;al-Qaeda&rsquo; militia Beirut struggles to heal the scars of war &ldquo;The establishment of the court according to an international resolution and without the agreement of a large segment of citizens ... widens and deepens the fracture among Lebanese,&rdquo; Omar Neshabi wrote. Tensions in the divided country have become increasingly sectarian with the most intense internal fighting since the country's civil war this month. More than 50 people have been killed in fighting between the Lebanese Army and Fatah al-Islam, a heavily-armed pro-Syrian splinter group. Hariri supporters denied that the move would lead to increased violence. &ldquo;It is a historic moment an opportunity for all Lebanese to unite... the court is not about vendettas, but about justice for all,&rdquo; said Hariri&rsquo;s son Saad, leader of the parliamentary majority. "Enough divisions. .. Let's put our energies together for the sake of the nation." The UN resolution gives the Lebanese government until June 10 to settle the arrangements for a court in a neutral country. The Lebanese parliament has until now been unable to agree over the scope and remit of a tribunal to study the circumstances of the former Prime Minister&rsquo;s death. The Security Council voted yesterday by 10-0 in favour of the tribunal, but five countries abstained. Russia, China, South Africa, Indonesia and Qatar objected to using Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, which deals with threats to international peace and allows military enforcement, as a basis for the resolution. Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador to the UN, warned that only a tribunal supported by all Lebanese factions would be effective. The council's move "will give rise to a series of political and legal problems, likely to add to the uncertainties embedded in the already turbulent political and security and situation in Lebanon," he said. The vote had been requested by Fouad Siniora, Lebanese Prime Minister, who claimed the trial would allow for &ldquo;the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth&rdquo; to be revealed. The UK and the United States were among the six sponsors of the resolution. Margaret Beckett, the Foreign Secretary, said: &ldquo;The Security Council has demonstrated its support for the government of Lebanon and its commitment to the principle that there shall be no impunity for political assassinations, in Lebanon or elsewhere.&rdquo; Reaction to the tribunal from Syria was hostile. Tishrin, the government newspaper, said in an editorial this morning that the resolution was &ldquo;absolutely an American-Israeli one and could never be regarded as an expression of the international will&rdquo;. Bashar Assad, President of Syria, has threatened not to cooperate with the court if it infringes on Syrian national sovereignty. * Town / City Save to my times Also in Middle East Fear and celebration greets Hariri tribunal vote by UN Lecturers&rsquo; union votes to back Israel boycott Anger at campaign to woo gay couples on Holy Land holidays Hunt for Britons goes on amid Iraqi violence Jobs and Gates bury the hatchet Mandela: Blair still has lots to offer world Woman dies after electricity cut off 'More tender than we could imagine' Where a spell of fame begins with a bee The Times in the Middle East A series of articles on the Middle East to mark the debut of International Edition in the region The restored Hejaz Railway is to be rebuilt as an intercity express Gaza close to civil war as Hamas threatens suicide attacks News and views from Ned Parker and Stephen Farrell Full coverage of Iraq For breaking news stories and detailed analysis Your guide to seeing the very best of what the Middle East has to offer Weather forecasts for the Middle East region Latest developments in oil, gas and other natural resources She relied on an oxygen machine.

Deputy spokesman Tom Casey said the United States is seeking consular access for Ali Shakeri, a peace activist from Irvine, Calif., who was supposed to leave Iran and fly to Europe on May 13 but never arrived at his destination. Shakeri is the third Iranian-American who has been detained in Iran in recent weeks. "What we are seeing is a disturbing pattern on the part of the Iranians in efforts to harass these innocent people," Casey said. He said all were visiting family members or engaged in professional work. Shakeri is founding board member at the University of California, Irvine's Center for Citizen Peacebuilding. Casey said Shakeri has no standing with the U.S. government. Conflicting Iranian press reports say Shakeri has been charged or soon will be charged.

(L'Osservatore Romano) Gerry and Kate McCann on board a private jet at Faro airport in Portugal as they leave for Rome. (AP / Steve Parsons) This March 2007 photo released by the McCann family shows Madeleine McCann. (AP /HO) Pope meets with parents of missing girl Updated Wed. May. 30 2007 8:00 AM ET The parents of four-year-old Madeleine McCann, who disappeared during a family vacation in Portugal on May 3, visited the Vatican today and met with Pope Benedict XVI. Kate and Gerry McCann, both devout Catholics, shook hands with the Pope as he made his way through a large crowd at the end of his general audience in St. Peter's Square. Then they handed the Pontiff a picture of their daughter. "The Pope put his hand on the photo, he blessed the photo and then spoke to the parents for a few minutes," Vatican Affairs Correspondent Gerry O'Connell told CTV Newsnet Wednesday. Kate, carrying a pink, fluffy toy cat belonging to her missing daughter, appeared to be holding back tears during the brief encounter. Madeleine's father kissed the Pope's hands. "You could see from their faces they were really torn with sorrow, they were appealing to the Pope," O'Connell said from Rome. Before the encounter, Madeleine's parents said they hoped to draw strength from their meeting as well as to help keep the campaign to find their daughter in the media spotlight. "We have mixed emotions about being here," Madeleine's father, Gerry, told reporters as he and his wife arrived to attend the Pope's general audience. "Under normal circumstances it would be one of the most exciting things we could do in our own lifetime, but very much on our minds is the fact that we're here without Madeleine." Madeleine vanished after her parents left her, and her brother and sister -- both aged 2 -- alone while they went to a nearby restaurant within their hotel complex in the Algarve. British media have reported $2.6 million pounds (Cdn$6.1 million dollars) has been contributed to a reward fund from citizens and celebrities such as J.K. Rowling and Sir Richard Branson. The McCanns said they would not return to the U.K. until their daughter was found. They are set to return to southern Portugal later Wednesday and are also planning trips to Madrid on Friday and Berlin on June 4.

Problems have arisen because the world changed and there was an attempt to make it unipolar,' Putin told reporters following talks with his Greek counterpart. There was a desire among several international actors to dictate their will to each and everyone and to act not in accordance with the norms of international life and law,' Putin said. This is very dangerous and unhealthy. The norms of international law were altered for political expediency. What is this political expediency and who defines it? In our view it is nothing other than diktat, than imperialism.' However US national security council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said that differences between the two nations 'could be worked out'. 'While we have some differences, they are nothing other than issues that can be worked out through the continued dialogue we have face to face,' he said. 'The United States and Russia cooperate on a range of issues from counter-terrorism to global energy solutions,' added Johndroe. Copyright AFX News Limited 2007. All rights reserved.

Last night, US vehicles took up positions around the edge of the capital's Sadr City district. The neighbourhood is a stronghold of the Mahdi Army militia, loosely led by the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, which some have claimed is behind the abductions. Four British security guards, employed by GardaWorld, and their client, a financial consultant working for the US company BearingPoint, were abducted from inside the finance ministry building in Baghdad shortly before noon on Tuesday. Men wearing police uniforms drove them away in the direction of Sadr City. A local policeman said a US helicopter fired on a car and home in the area shortly before dawn, killing an elderly couple who had been sleeping on their roof because of the hot weather. The US military did not comment on the alleged attack, but said its forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" in Sadr City today. According to a confidential Iraqi government report into the kidnapping, parts of which were leaked to the media today, the defence and interior ministers believe the raid was the work of the Mahdi Army. The report, written by the head of the finance ministry's data processing centre, where the Britons were seized, quoted General David Petraeus, the US commander in Iraq, as saying the Mahdi Army "will be profoundly sorry" if it carried out the attack. However, others doubt the militia is to blame. Sheikh Abdel al-Sattar al-Bahadli, a leading cleric with experience in hostage negotiation, told the BBC's Arab service that the Mahdi Army was not involved and wanted to build a new Iraq peacefully. According to the report, four men in civilian clothing arrived at the ministry building around 15 minutes before the kidnapping, claiming to be from the government's anti-fraud commission and checking each room before leaving. Shortly afterwards, dozens of men in army and police uniforms burst into the building, disarmed guards and went to the room in which the five Britons were working. The men were immediately taken out and driven away in a convoy of four-wheel drive vehicles. The foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, said British officials were doing all they could to secure the "swift and safe release" of the Britons. "This is clearly a very distressing time for all concerned," she said yesterday. "Foreign Office officials are offering help and assistance to the next of kin. We are working closely with the Iraqi authorities." Tony Blair, speaking in Sierra Leone, said: "We know the dangers and challenges there [in Iraq], but we shouldn't let those who are prepared to use kidnapping and terrorism succeed."

Mr Putin said it was a "response to maintain the strategic balance in the world", in what he called a "new round of the arms race". He added that Russia would continue to improve its resources. Russia tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile, which can be armed with up to 10 warheads, on Tuesday. These actions by Russia should not be feared, they are not aggressive Europe diary: Missile defence "Our American partners have left the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty," Mr Putin told a press conference. "We have warned them then that we will come out with a response to maintain the strategic balance in the world." Mr Putin defended Russia's actions, insisting they were not the "initiators of this new round of the arms race". "(Our partners) are stuffing Eastern Europe with new weapons," he said. "A new base in Bulgaria, another in Romania, a site in Poland, radar in the Czech Republic. What are we supposed to do? We cannot just observe all this." He added: "These actions by Russia should not be feared, they are not aggressive, it's just an answer to rather tough and unjustified unilateral actions by partners." Washington wants to deploy interceptor rockets in Poland and a radar base in the Czech Republic to counter what it describes as a potential threat from "rogue states" such as Iran and North Korea. The US maintains its system is not directed at the Russians, but Moscow says its security is being threatened. Russia's test launch took place at the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia on 29 May. The missile, called RS-24, was designed to evade missile defence systems, the Russian defence ministry says. The test missile successfully struck its target 5,500km (3,400 miles) away on the far eastern Kamchatka peninsula, the Russian Strategic Missile Forces said.

While many in Lebanon welcome the decision, pro-Syrian voices threaten that it may destabilize the country. Lebanese government supporters celebrate after hearing that the UN Security Council voted to set up a tribunal into the murder of former PM Rafik Hariri. The United Nations Security Council has voted to set up a tribunal to look into the 2005 murder of the former Lebanese premier, Rafik Hariri. But while the pro-Western government welcomes the move, pro-Syrian voices say the tribunal could further destablize the country. The Security Council voted on Wednesday to unilaterally establish an international tribunal to investigate Hariri's assassination. Five members of the 15-member body abstained during the vote, including veto powers Russia and China. The tribunal needed at least nine votes in favor to go ahead. The resolution stipulates that a 2006 agreement between the UN and Lebanon on the creation of a tribunal will automatically come into effect on June 10, if the conflicting parties in Lebanon do not agree to set up their own tribunal. The five countries that abstained objected to establishing it without the Lebanese parliament's approval and to putting the resolution under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, which deals with threats to international peace and allows for military enforcement. Syria has fiercely criticized the UN decision, arguing that the tribunal undermines Lebanon's sovereignty and threatens to further destabilize the country. And Syrian President Bashar Assad has already indicated that he will not cooperate with the investigation if it infringes on Syrian soverignity. After Wednesday's vote Syria's UN ambassador Bashar Ja'afari said: "This is something that goes against the interests of the Lebanese people and Lebanon as a whole." Hariri, a prominent critic of Syria's involvement in Lebanon, was killed by a suicide bomb attack in Beirut on Feb. 14, 2005, along with 22 other people. The huge protests in the aftermath of the killing forced Syria to end a decades-long military presence in the country. The intial investigation into the assassination, carried out by Germany's Detlev Mehlis, pointed to the involvement of Syrian and Lebanese intelligence agents. Four pro-Syrian Lebanese generals have been under arrest for 20 months in connection with the crime. Sign up for Spiegel Online's daily newsletter and get the best of Der Spiegel's and Spiegel Online's international coverage in your In- The issue of the tribunal has sharply polarized opinion in Lebanon, often along sectarian lines. Prime Minister Fuad Saniora, who leads a Western-backed government, had asked the Security Council earlier this month to establish the tribunal, after the parliamentary speaker, Nabih Berri, refused to convene a session so that the parliament could ratify the tribunal. Berri, a leading member of the pro-Syrian opposition, said Thursday that the Security Council is ignoring the need for a Lebanese consensus on the issue. "You have picked internationalization instead of the state," he said in a brief statement. The parliament in Beirut still has a chance to set up a tribunal under its own steam. But if it does not act by June 10, then an international tribunal will created outside the country. Saniora said that the tribunal would finally be able to uncover the truth about the Hariri murder. Supporters of the slain politician danced in the streets on Wednesday night after hearing news of the UN decision. His son Saad Hariri, who now leads the anti-Syrian coalition which controls the government, said the resolution was a turning point in Lebanon, which would protect the country from further assassinations. He called it a "victory the world has given to oppressed Lebanon."

(New York, May 31, 2007) – The Iranian government should immediately release two Iranian-Americans from detention and clarify the case of a third who may have "disappeared," a group of leading human rights organizations said today. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation for Human Rights, Reporters Without Borders and the Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi also urged Iran to lift travel bans on two journalists with dual nationality whom Iran has barred from traveling back to their home countries. These measures appear to be an attempt by Iran's security authorities to sow fear into the wider community of journalists, writers, scholars and activists. Their exchanges with counterparts in other parts of the world underscore both their commitment to enhance mutual respect and recognition of human dignity through dialogue and to see human rights norms upheld in their country. "These actions violate Iran's laws as well as international norms," said Ebadi, winner of the 2003 Nobel peace prize, who is also the lawyer for two of those caught in the crackdown. "The Judiciary is denying dual-nationals their basic rights." The detentions and travel bans are part of a broad crackdown being mounted against Iranian human rights activists, students, and labor organizers by Iranian intelligence officials based in the country's Information Ministry. Intelligence officials in the Information Ministry are currently holding two Iranian-American scholars, Kian Tajbakhsh and Haleh Esfandiari, inside Tehran's notorious Evin prison. Another Iranian-American, Ali Shakeri, a peace activist from Irvine, California, is also believed to be in detention, and may be the victim of an enforced disappearance. In addition, the government has confiscated the passports of two journalists, Parnaz Azima, an Iranian-American, and Mehrnoush Solouki, a French-Iranian, preventing them from leaving Iran. Ebadi and the human rights groups expressed grave concerns for the health and safety of the detainees as well as the two journalists trapped in Iran. Esfandiari and Tajbakhsh are currently being held in ward 209 of Evin prison. On May 29, 2007, the Judiciary's spokesperson, Alireza Jamshidi, told a news conference that they and Azima had been charged after a complaint was made against them by the Information Ministry. It accuses them of "acting against national security by engaging in propaganda against the Islamic republic by the method of spying on behalf of foreigners." Agents of the Information Ministry arrested Esfandiari on May 8. The 67-year-old director of the Middle East program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, DC, was transferred to Evin prison the same day. Tajbakhsh, a 45-year-old social scientist who consulted for the Iranian government as well as international organizations, was detained three days later, on May 11. Both are being detained incommunicado and denied access to their lawyers or family. On May 20, the Information Ministry issued a statement accusing Esfandiari of promoting civil society in Iran "to further the interests of foreign powers." This statement and a number of articles in the hardline daily have referred to the professional activities of Esfandiari and Tajbakhsh, such as attending international scholarly conferences, as evidence of "acting against national security." "These charges are politically motivated and only serve to further isolate Iranian civil society," Ebadi said. "The government is punishing these detainees because they promoted dialogue between Iranians and the international community." Shakeri, 59, "disappeared" on May 8 as he was leaving Iran for Europe. According to his associates, he called his family 48 hours later to say that "there was a misunderstanding, and I am OK." On May 29, the Judiciary's spokesperson said "Shakeri is not in detention, and there are no charges against him." However, Shakeri's whereabouts remain unknown. The international organizations called on the Iranian government to investigate Shakeri's initial detention on May 8, to make public his current whereabouts and to release him if he is in detention, and allow him to leave the country to join his family in California. The authorities have also banned two journalists with dual nationality from leaving Iran. Solouki, a Quebec University journalism student who has dual French and Iranian nationality, was detained on February 17 while making a documentary film about events following the 1988 ceasefire in the war between Iran and Iraq. She was held for a month at Evin prison by Information Ministry officials who also confiscated her notes and film, and then released on bail of 100 million Touman (US$100,000) on March 19. However, the authorities did not return her passport, preventing her from leaving Iran. Intelligence officials have summoned her for interrogation several times since her release. Azima, a reporter for the Persian-language services of Radio Free Europe who holds both Iranian and American citizenship, is also being prevented from leaving Iran. Her passport was confiscated by the authorities in January 2007. On May 21, following the deposit of a large bail payment, the authorities refused to return her passport, citing the interest in her case by the Information Ministry. Iranian intelligence agents often bring politically motivated charges of "endangering national security" against activists and intellectuals. Agents of the Information Ministry arrested Abdolfattah Soltani, a prominent human rights lawyer, in August 2005, accusing him of spying. The ministry's agents held Soltani in Evin prison for seven months, before releasing him on bail. On May 28, 2007, an appeals court in Tehran acquitted Soltani of all charges. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation for Human Rights, Reporters Without Borders, and Ebadi reminded the Iranian authorities that they bear full responsibility for the health and safety of all those detained by the state, and that all detainees must be treated with dignity and allowed access to their lawyers and visitors. They also called on the Iranian government to end its persecution and prosecution of dual-national scholars and journalists.

The views expressed are the author's alone. JERUSALEM, 31 May 2007 (IRIN) - A new report issued on Monday by the International Labour Organization (ILO) says seven out of 10 households in the occupied Palestinian territories, or about 2.4 million Palestinians, are living in poverty. It says the workers' situation has continued to worsen dramatically over the past year. According to the report, entitled The Situation of Workers of the Occupied Arab Territories, the Israeli-imposed "closures [checkpoints and movement restrictions] are the main cause of the worsening socio-economic situation of Palestinian women and men." These restrictions on the freedom of movement, which intensified in 2006, the report says, have adversely affected labourers, and products cannot be moved on domestic or international markets. Israel says it needs the checkpoints to ensure the safety of its citizens. Hasan Barghouthi from the Democracy and Workers' Rights Centre in Ramallah in the West Bank said he was not surprised by the ILO findings. "The checkpoints create poverty. People are suffering because of this poverty," he said. A recent report by the World Bank echoed these sentiments, and indicated that Palestinians cannot hope for any economic growth without a significant change in the closure policy. "In economic terms, the restrictions have&#133; stymied growth and investment which is necessary to fuel economic revival," the World Bank wrote in its report entitled Movement and Access Restrictions (May 2007). Barghouthi said growth was desperately needed: "About 65 per cent of Palestinians live on less than US $2 a day. In the Gaza Strip, where the majority of the population were refugees, this figure was over 80 per cent," he said. The ILO report also said the inability of the Palestinian Authority (PA) to pay wages to its employees since March 2006 was having a devastating effect. Over one million people, out of an estimated total population of 3.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, depended on these salaries. The PA has been subjected to an international boycott, including a freezing of aid money, since the Islamic Hamas movement rose to power in last year's elections and refused to recognise Israel and renounce violence. In addition, Israel refuses to hand over taxes it collects for the PA, compounding the fiscal crisis. Shlomo Dror, from the office of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories at the Israeli Ministry of Defence, said: "The new PA government does not recognise Israel and, therefore, the meetings needed to facilitate the transfer of tax funds cannot be conducted." The ILO further said the non-payment of wages had led to public sector strikes which had disrupted delivery of vital services, including in the health and education sectors, and this "has contributed to social and institutional erosion." Hana Zohar, from the Israeli Workers' Hotline (Kav LaOved), said that given this situation, the Israeli government decision to limit the number of Palestinians able to work inside Israel had led to further complications for workers. Workers from Gaza were unable to work in Israel. "The government has also decided that by 2008 no Palestinians will work inside Israel. This means more and more of them are working in Israeli settlements in the West Bank," she said, in line with the ILO report, which added that this change in labour patterns was an active policy initiated by the Israeli government. The ILO called the settlements "illegal under international law". Zohar said this change meant Palestinian workers were more likely to be abused. Low pay, poor conditions "About 90 per cent of Palestinian workers don't receive the minimum wage, in part because there is no government enforcement in the West Bank," Zohar said, basing her comments on her organisation's research. "In some cases, Israeli employers withhold wages for months" adding to the poverty problems. "But besides this, the conditions are the worst thing. Unsafe. In some cases, they work with chemicals in plastic factories without any protection," she said. In essence, some Palestinian labourers endanger their health without even getting paid. However, Dror, from the Israeli Ministry of Defence, said: "Any Palestinian can turn to an Israeli court, if he feels his rights are violated. And many in fact do exactly that." He also said work permits are issued based on the demands of employers, and his office increased the number of Palestinians working for Israeli businesses, regardless of job location. "How many states would even let people at war with them work in their country at all?" he asked. Dror added that the ILO report ignored many of Israel's security needs and concerns. Zohar said that ultimately Israel should realise that if it did not allow Palestinians to earn a living, it would be responsible, under international humanitarian law, to care for them and their needs.

The Quartet of Middle East peacemakers, which includes Russia, the US, the UN and the EU, urged Wednesday to end fighting between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, calling on the PA government to "do everything necessary to restore law and order." The group, which met in Berlin, also urged "all Palestinians to immediately renounce all acts of violence and respect the cease-fire."

"The resolution, as much as it constitutes a violation of the Lebanese state and an attack on its internal affairs, it is contrary to legal rules and the charters and principles of the United Nations and the objectives for which it was established to achieve," said a statement issued by the group. "Therefore, it (the resolution) amounts to a flagrant violation that makes the resolution illegal and illegitimate at the national and international level," the statement said. The U.N. Security Council voted late Wednesday to approve the tribunal, bypassing Lebanon&#039;s parliament which has failed to meet to endorse it. The Shiite Muslim militant group has previously warned against the creation of the tribunal under the militarily enforceable Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter. Today in Africa &#038; Middle East Jihadist groups fill a Palestinian power vacuum UN Security Council approves Hariri tribunal Sunni-Kurdish conflict worsens Iraqi disarray Separately, Mahmoud Komati, deputy leader of Hezbollah&#039;s political bureau, said on Al-Arabiya television that the resolution "was a violation of Lebanese sovereignty because the Security Council regarded Lebanon as lacking constitutional institutions and without state authority." The Hezbollah statement said the resolution placed Lebanon under "international tutelage, without decision-making and sovereignty in an unprecedented development in the history of sovereign states." The pro-Syrian and pro-Iranian group said the government was giving "a glorious favor" to the U.S. administration through which it could use Lebanon as a card that could be used to exert political pressure. Hezbollah insisted the creation of the tribunal would not help solve the political crisis buffeting Lebanon. It called on the pro-government faction "to realize that the real crisis has always been over political participation in decision-making among all Lebanese factions. Hezbollah and its opposition allies have demanded a veto-wielding share in the Cabinet. Prime Minister Fuad Saniora, backed by the anti-Syrian majority, has rejected the demand and has resisted an opposition campaign to step down.

Thaksin, deposed in a September coup, was last night judged to have violated election laws in an April 2006 snap poll by a junta-appointed tribunal. The nine judges disbanded his Thai Rak Thai party and slapped five-year political bans on 111 of its executives. Thailand&#39;s junta, which wants to pass a new constitution via referendum before elections promised for December, may find it hard to get support from the millions of Thais who gave Thaksin a record mandate of 377 of 500 parliamentary seats in 2005. The exiled leader called the ruling harsh and unexpected. ``The confrontation that we&#39;ve had in Thailand over the past two years is now likely to deepen,&#39;&#39; said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. ``There&#39;s a very large electorate that has been left dangling.&#39;&#39; ``It is certain that people around the country won&#39;t accept this ruling,&#39;&#39; Chaturon Chaisang, acting leader of Thai Rak Thai, told supporters at the party headquarters in Bangkok last night. ``The country is under the rule of military dictators. The country is under a regime that is not acceptable in the international community.&#39;&#39; The same judges absolved the Democrat Party of offenses including preventing parties from contesting last year&#39;s election via a boycott. Members of that party, Thailand&#39;s oldest and Thaksin&#39;s main opposition when he was in power, will be able to take part in planned December elections. ``This is a huge political windfall for the Democrat Party&#39;&#39; said Thitinan of Chulalongkorn University. ``They lost recent elections. Now the Democrat Party looks like they will lead the next coalition.&#39;&#39; Among 44 political parties listed on the Web site of the Office of the Election Commission of Thailand as of February, Thai Rak Thai was the largest, with 14.4 million members. The Democrat Party was second biggest with 4.1 million members. Korn Chatikavanij, deputy secretary-general of the Democrat Party in Thailand, said that his party was ``sympathetic&#39;&#39; to Thai Rak Thai members and would ``reach out to them.&#39;&#39; Thaksin, in a statement issued by his lawyer Noppadol Pattama, said the verdict ``will be studied and criticized for a long time&#39;&#39; and called on the junta to return democracy to the people quickly. He called on Thai Rak Thai members to continue with political activity ``for the benefit of the country.&#39;&#39; ``People have been quiet so far,&#39;&#39; said James McCormack, head of Asian sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings. ``But the first opportunity people have to voice an opinion is this referendum that&#39;s coming up in the middle of the year.&#39;&#39; Bangkok was peaceful during the reading of the verdict Wednesday afternoon and night and on Thursday. Thailand&#39;s junta deployed more than 10,000 soldiers and police in the capital, and said today it would maintain an indefinite national security clampdown, according to AFP. ``Security measures have been stepped up since last night and will gradually be increased,&#39;&#39; Army Chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin told the news agency. ``The measures will be in place for a long time.&#39;&#39; The tribunal last night found Pongsak Raktapongpaisal, Thaksin&#39;s former transport minister, and Thammarak Isarangura Na Ayutthaya, his ex-defense minister, guilty of paying candidates from smaller parties to run in an April 2006 election that was later annulled. The two small parties are the Thai Ground Party and Pattana Chartthai Party, the judges said. ``Banning those executives is aimed at preventing them from having a chance to cause damage to the country again,&#39;&#39; Judge Krairerk Kasemsant said while delivering the verdict, broadcast on state-controlled radio and television. With staunch support from Thailand&#39;s majority rural voters, Thai Rak Thai, or `Thais Love Thais&#39; captured a record number of parliamentary seats in Feb. 2005 elections, delivering the first absolute majority in the country&#39;s history and making Thaksin the first prime minister elected for two consecutive terms. Thaksin&#39;s overthrow followed months of protests against his rule and the election he called in an attempt to quell them. That vote was boycotted by the opposition and later voided for the charges ruled on yesterday. To contact the reporters on this story: Dominic G.

However, Roh said he believed Pyongyang&#039;s nuclear program was strictly a bargaining chip and that leader Kim Jong Il would give up his bombs if appropriate conditions were met: security guarantees, aid and normal relations with the U.S. "North Korea harbors huge anxieties or fears toward the United States and (South Korea). And in this climate, North Korea, I believe, chose the development of a nuclear program and with this nuclear program I believe they try to use it as a negotiating tool," Roh said during an interview with AP President and CEO Tom Curley. "This was a political strategy." Roh, whose term expires in February, also said there could be time while he&#039;s in office to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il &#8212; but only if the North moves to abandon its nuclear program. International talks on North Korea&#039;s nuclear program have been beset by repeated delays since the crisis erupted in late 2002, and most recently are deadlocked over some US$25 million (&#8364;18.6 million) in North Korean accounts frozen in a Macau bank. That bank was blacklisted in 2005 by Washington for alleged complicity in counterfeiting U.S. dollars and money laundering by the Pyongyang regime. Today in Asia - Pacific Thailand facing uncertainty after court ruling An escapee tells of life and death in North Korea&#x27;s labor camps U.S. and India closer to nuclear agreement Washington agreed to help free the money to win North Korea&#039;s promise to shut down its sole operating nuclear reactor by mid-April and eventually dismantle its weapons program. But the money has not yet been withdrawn because other banks have shunned the tainted funds &#8212; and North Korea has refused to lock down its reactor until it gets the money. Roh said the South had hoped to intervene to resolve the dispute. He did not elaborate, but local news reports have said Seoul was considering asking a South Korean bank to be the middleman for getting the money to a North Korean account. "We have offered to help in resolving the (bank) issue to both sides, but after our offer there has not been an answer from either side," he said, referring to Washington and Pyongyang. The top U.S. negotiator on North Korea, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill, appealed Thursday for Pyongyang to shut down its reactor regardless of the financial dispute. But after meetings with Chinese nuclear envoy Wu Dawei in Beijing, he said there was no new resolution to that matter. To help relax regional tension, Roh also left open the possibility of holding a summit with the North&#039;s Kim, which would follow the first-and-only such meeting between the two Koreas in 2000 between Kim and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. However, he said such talks could not go forward without movement at the six-nation North Korea nuclear talks, which also include China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States. Talk of a North-South summit has percolated recently in Seoul, drawing fire from opponents as an inappropriate political ploy to help boost Roh&#039;s liberals ahead of December presidential elections. "Regardless of my term, I believe a good time would be when the six-party talks are well on (their) way to implementation and when we can be sure that a summit will contribute to cementing this progress," Roh said. Ties cooled between the two Koreas last year after North Korea tested a barrage of missiles in July and tensions deepened after Pyongyang conducted its first-ever nuclear test in October. The Koreas resumed efforts at rapprochement after the North pledged initial steps toward nuclear disarmament. Those efforts have also been put on hold over the North&#039;s delay in shutting down its nuclear reactor. A high-level delegation from North Korea was in Seoul for reconciliation talks set to end Friday, where the South has insisted the North start to dismantle its weapons program before Seoul delivers promised aid. Roh said Seoul would continue to press the North to disarm, using aid as leverage. South Korea has drawn criticism at home and abroad over its "sunshine policy" of continued engagement even as Pyongyang refuses to back down from nuclear weapons development. "The fact that the Korean government is practicing the &#039;sunshine policy&#039; toward North Korea does not mean that we forfeit all rights to take issue with North Korea&#039;s missile launches and nuclear test," Roh said. "Although we fully embrace the &#039;sunshine policy,&#039; I believe that what has to be said, has to be said."

It’s astounding to an observer what Israel, a sovereign country and strong military force in the region, is willing to subject itself and its citizens to on a daily basis. The contortionist-like movements of the current government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert should be allowed to qualify for some kind of international circus act. The big news out of the area on Tuesday morning was that the nearly powerless Pales­tinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, is planning to meet with the almost as politically weak Mr. Olmert. What will this meeting be about, anyway? Will they discuss once again how to effectuate a cease-fire between the two sides? Additionally, why is this being discussed with Mr. Abbas, who represents Fatah, when it seems (to those capable of discerning the difference) that the missiles into Israel are being fired by people he does not represent or wield any influence over—like Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and assorted other terrorist corporate entities. In the meantime, as a people—no matter where we reside, in Israel or here—we’ve become successfully desensitized to the deaths and injuries in Sderot, as long as they are luridly kept to a tiny minimum that apparently does not warrant any effective or serious Israeli military response or diplomatic outrage in Israel, America, or anywhere else in the civilized world. What can possibly be achieved by an Olmert–Abbas meeting—other than to raise Olmert’s embarrassingly low popularity rating with the Israeli public as we pick up speed in the direction of early elections in Israel? What will Abbas have to say about Gilad Shalit, who has been held hostage in Gaza for close to a year now, right under Mr. Abbas’s nose? What will Mr. Abbas have to say about the arrest by Israeli forces earlier this week of the terrorist Khaled Shawish, whom Israel has been looking for since 2002 when he oversaw the murder of Binyamin and Taliye Kahane, the children of the murdered Rabbi Meir Kahane? The Kahane couple were shot and killed as they were returning home after spending a Shabbos in Jerusalem, leaving behind six orphans. Shawish had been protected from the IDF, first by Yasser Arafat and then over the last several years by Mr. Abbas, the great purveyor of peace. Israel does not want to send forces into Gaza to wipe out the terrorist infrastructure there mostly because of pressure from the U.S. and Europe to give the Palestinians the opportunity to police themselves. You don’t have to belong to a military think tank to realize that this idea has been a miserable failure from the beginning. The notion hangs out there that the only thing that can bring all the murderous factions from continuing to ply their trade on one another is an all-out attack from Israel. The Olmert government feels that after last summer’s Lebanon fiasco, he cannot afford politically to get Israel’s forces mired in another Arab-Israeli conflict. So far, the price paid for this course has been only a few deaths, some injured, and the paralysis and traumatization of Sderot. One Israeli military officer told Haaretz this week that if the attacks and fighting remain at this level, they are tolerable. Then he said, “If they hit a kindergarten with a missile and kill children, then all bets are off.” Is this a wild approach, or what? In the meantime, they sit and wait. Clearly, there is a game of international intrigue being played—a form of an everyday street game of chicken. While Israel can pulverize Gaza and bomb them into submission, Hamas and their partners also possess the firepower and missiles that can be fired deeper into Israel. So both are exercising some restraint, but it’s absurd that Israel, one of the world’s leading military powers, is willing to subject itself to this type of bloody charade. The hope is, of course, to use power to get each side to sit and talk and make real concessions to one another. Not included in the equation is the reality that rarely has a Palestinian governing entity entered into an agreement that it was able to abide by. That’s where Mr. Abbas comes into the picture, being the one capable of projecting an image of being the least violence-oriented of all Palestinian leaders throughout their rather brief history. In the past, Israeli leaders would not have tolerated this type of wanton victimization of the civilian population. Prior to the deception of the Oslo Accords, the Israeli response to missiles being shot at civilians would have been both fast and fatal for the enemy. Today in the Middle East, violence has become a tool of diplomacy rather than war. Israel knows this all too well, but feels that she has no choice, because the U.S., bowing to the pressures of Saudi Arabia and others, constantly coaxes and cajoles Israel into giving diplomacy another try—and another, again and again, usually with no positive result. It’s also interesting that now that the U.S. has begun to try a new approach by meeting with representatives of Iran and Syria in forums—ostensibly for the better good of Iraq—they are about to find out what the word of an Islamic leader really means. Just prior to the U.S. meeting with the Iranian representative in Baghdad, the Iranians issued an order to step up their support and activity on behalf of the terrorist insurgents in Iraq. The plan, according to debka.com, was so that when they would sit down with the Americans, they could immediately concede to the scaling back of their support of terror without losing much ground in their terror war offensive against U.S. troops. Perhaps the good news, if there is any, is that the U.S. is about to find out through hard experience what Israel has been experiencing since Oslo in 1993. And that is that agreements that other Middle Eastern leaders enter into—whether it’s Oslo, or the Road Map, or any other—are not taken seriously and remain wholly unfulfilled. The question is how the U.S. will act as future agreements with the Iranians, the Syrians, and eventually the Iraqis are not just unfulfilled but blatantly violated. Will the American government at that point still insist that Israel keep its part of agreements, though they are being broken by the other side, so as to build up the dwindling strength of leaders like Abbas? Still further in this unfolding crooked equation is the notion that the press—and in particular the New York Times—loves to report on whether Israel’s response to the firing of missiles is a “proportionate response” or not. The Times likes very much to declare that Israel is using undue and disproportionate force in responding to Palestinian attacks on Sderot. This past Sunday and in several other dispatches from Israel, the Times makes sure to report that since the violence has escalated, more than fifty Palestinians have been killed and two Israelis have been killed. The idea promoted is that Israel is misusing its overwhelming strength against Palestinian makeshift, homemade rockets. It would be an absurd suggestion, not to be taken seriously, if not for the fact that almost no one takes it seriously except for the Israelis. My goodness, what happened to a straight-shooting military and straight-shooting leadership? It seems that today only in Israel does a leader check his poll numbers and his prospects for reelection before asking the military to do its job of protecting the country’s citizens. If not for the tragic results, the entire situation would be laughable. 5tjt.com all rights reserved

Jakarta governor Sutiyoso cut short his trip to Sydney and demanded an apology after saying police had entered his hotel room uninvited as he slept. He said they wanted him to testify at an inquest into the deaths of five journalists in East Timor in 1975. New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma said he was "disturbed" by the report. "I apologise for the distress and inconvenience caused and regret your early departure from New South Wales," he wrote in a letter to Gov Sutiyoso, made public to news outlets. He said a review of the circumstances surrounding the incident revealed the state's "co-ordination of security and protocol was less than satisfactory". "This is extremely disappointing to me," he added. The apology appears to have dampened diplomatic tensions that had risen over the incident. Indonesia had lodged a formal protest. Gov Sutiyoso had been in Sydney at the invitation of the state government when police allegedly entered his hotel room as he slept. "They barged into my room after forcing the hotel to give them a duplicate key," he told reporters after returning to Jakarta. He said they asked him to sign an invitation to testify at the inquest into the five journalists who were killed in the East Timor town of Balibo on October 1975. Australia and Indonesia have always said the journalists died accidentally, having been caught in crossfire as Indonesian troops entered the town. A senior lawyer told the inquest on Wednesday that far from being an accident, the journalists deliberately shot by Indonesian troops after they tried to surrender, according to the testimony of witnesses. Gov Sutiyoso, a former general, said he had served in East Timor in 1975 but was never stationed in Balibo.

Lavrov, accused the United States of starting a new arms race and implicitly threatened to veto any United Nations Security Council resolution that, like the one proposed by the United States and its European allies, would recognize the independence of Kosovo. Even as the White House and the Kremlin were announcing plans for a rare kiss-and-make-up meeting between President Bush and President , their top diplomats were clashing here in the historic castle where Churchill, Truman and met to decide how to carve up Germany after World War II. This time, the big issue was the carving up of the former Yugoslavia, where the mostly Albanian-inhabited province of Kosovo wants to secede from Serbia. That, along with the American plan to place antimissile bases in Poland and the Czech Republic, has pitted Russia against the West in a war of words with flashbacks to the cold war. Mr. Lavrov harshly criticized Washington&#8217;s plan to build a missile shield over countries that were once part of the Soviet sphere of influence. And he took issue with Secretary of State for calling Russian concerns about it ludicrous. &#8220;All they&#8217;re saying is, &#8216;Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s not aimed at you,&#8217; &#8221; Mr. Lavrov said at a news conference after the meeting. &#8220;It&#8217;s such answers that are ludicrous.&#8221; &#8220;We quite agree,&#8221; Ms. Rice said with a sly smile, countering that Russian officials themselves have bragged that their strategic defense systems can easily overwhelm any missile defense system that the United States puts up in Europe. Mr. Lavrov was having none of it. &#8220;I hope that no one has to prove that Condi is right about that,&#8221; he interjected. Their clashes are indicative of a chill in their countries&#8217; relations. In February, Mr. Putin delivered a blistering speech accusing the United States of undermining international institutions and making the Middle East more unstable through its clumsy handling of the Iraq war. Russia is also deeply unhappy about the expansion of into the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and about the perception in Russia that the West has supported groups that have toppled other governments in Moscow&#8217;s former sphere of influence. Mr. Bush, Ms. Rice and Secretary of Defense have tried, without success, to reassure the Russians that the missile system is aimed at preventing attack by the likes of Iran or North Korea. The tensions have heightened to the point that the two countries have decided to hold a one-on-one session between Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush on July 1 in Kennebunkport, Me. But it is hard to see how that will tone down the sparring, given how far apart the two behemoths are on Kosovo. The United States and its Western European allies favor a draft resolution endorsing supervised independence for Kosovo, where a NATO bombing campaign in 1999 helped defeat Serbian forces. Russia is adamantly opposed. At the meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Lavrov repeatedly questioned why the United States was so intent on resolving Kosovo&#8217;s status when other areas of the world were in dispute. &#8220;Lavrov said, &#8216;Why don&#8217;t we solve the case of Western Sahara first?&#8217; &#8221; said a European official who was at the session, speaking on condition of anonymity under customary diplomatic rules. &#8220;He even brought up Abkhazia,&#8221; the obscure Black Sea region that has been trying to secede from Georgia. &#8220;And every time Lavrov said something, Condi would jump in,&#8221; the official said. &#8220;It was like tennis.&#8221; Mr. Lavrov did not tone down his ire over the Kosovo plan after the meeting, when the foreign ministers held their news conference and most tried to act cordial. He hinted, as Russian officials have before, that Russia would veto any Security Council resolution seeking to recognize Kosovo as an independent country, unless Serbia agreed first, which diplomats said was very unlikely. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine a situation where the Security Council will approve such a resolution,&#8221; Mr. Lavrov said. &#8220;Such a situation will not happen.&#8221; A senior Bush administration official acknowledged that the administration, in more than six years, had not figured out how to manage its relationship with Russia. &#8220;There are a lot of things we have that are of common interest, and at the same time, we need to push where necessary,&#8221; said the official, speaking anonymously under diplomatic rules. &#8220;And to be able to do both things at the same time is hard, particularly for American administrations. We either tend to do one or the other, and for this to work we have to do both.&#8221; More Articles in International &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Several of the top diplomats gathering in the eastern city of Potsdam were due to travel to nearby Berlin for a meeting of the Quartet on Middle East peace, grouping the US, the UN, the EU and Russia later Wednesday. The Potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the Group of Eight most industrialized nations in Heiligendamm, northeast Germany, June 6-8. The ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the North Korean nuclear program, strife-torn Afghanistan and the future status of Kosovo. Although the environment was not on the official agenda, Japan poured cold water on a German proposal to complete negotiations on a successor to the Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gases by 2009, calling it "premature." Chancellor Angela Merkel has staked Germany's 12-month presidency of the G8 on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases -- a prospect Washington has rejected out of hand. The future status of Kosovo, an issue that bitterly divides Russia and the West, also sparked a heated discussion in Potsdam. Russia rejects proposals by chief UN negotiator Martti Ahtisaari to grant Kosovo internationally supervised independence from Serbia. "The fate of Serbia, the fate of Kosovo, should not be decided in New York, not in Potsdam and not in other formats but rather in direct negotiations between the two sides," Lavrov told his G8 counterparts. He firmly rejected a call by Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany for Russia to cooperate with international partners on the issue. The participants of the G8 foreign ministers meeting pose for a family picture in the eastern German city of Potsdam. Make Alalam your homepage Copyright © 2004 - 2007 Alalam Inc.

Thaksin tells supporters to accept party ban BANGKOK: A constitutional court has banned the political party of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra after finding it guilty of election fraud, in a ruling that could throw Thai politics into disarray. But Mr Thaksin on Wednesday urged his stunned supporters to accept the ruling. In a statement read by his lawyer in Bangkok, he also urged the generals who ousted him in a bloodless coup last September to speed up elections promised for December. "As founder who led the party until the coup, I must apologise to party members, the executive committee and every supporter for an unexpected outcome," Thaksin said. "I would urge everyone to stay calm and don't make any moves." The court barred Mr Thaksin and 110 other executives of the party from participating in politics for five years, removing from the scene some of Thailand's most powerful politicians. The prospect of Mr Thaksin's return to power and the resurgence of his party has been one of the chief concerns of the country's military leaders. The court ruled that the party, Thai Rak Thai, was guilty of paying small parties to stand against it in an election in April last year to satisfy a requirement for minimum participation. "It used parliamentary elections only as a means to achieve totalitarian power," Judge Vichai Chuenchompoonuj said. "It goes to show that the defendant does not believe in the democratic system. It also shows no respect for the rule of law, which is key to the democratic system." The nine-member court accused Mr Thaksin of using the party for his own gain and said the party had no ideology beyond its leader's ambitions. The rival Democrat Party, Thailand's oldest, was found not guilty of breaking the laws. Security was tight in Bangkok as the verdicts were read, but tension was much less than security officials had predicted. The announcement was greeted with cries and tears at Thai Rak Thai headquarters. Party leaders have said that if Thai Rak Thai was disbanded, they would come together in a new party. But a ban on participation of many of their executives was a serious blow to that plan.

Mr Berezovsky shed light on his relationship with the former FSB agent Andrei Lugovoy just before the Russian prosecutor general's office announced that swapping the two men for trial had been ruled out. Mr Berezovsky is wanted in Russia on fraud charges while Britain wants to extradite Mr Lugovoy on suspicion of murdering Mr Litvinenko, a former Russian agent, with the radioactive polonium-210. Speaking at the Miller Academy on Tuesday night, Mr Berezovsky said that he had known Mr Lugovoy, his former bodyguard, "for a long time", and trusted him. Following Mr Litvinenko's death last November, Mr Lugovoy telephoned the billionaire. "I told him - if you are not guilty, you should come to this country - go to Heathrow and talk to Scotland Yard. There is no chance you will go to jail if you are not guilty. I told him there was a polonium trail all over Europe, including in my office, and that he had to explain it. "I got no answer" from Mr Lugovoy, said Mr Berezovsky, adding that "all the steps of Lugovoy just confirm that he is behind" the poisoning. But he said that he still felt uneasy about Mr Lugovoy's role in the killing, as the former agent had previously protected Mr Berezovsky and his family in Russia, as well as the former pro-reform prime minister Yegor Gaidar. Mr Lugovoy denies any connection to the Litvinenko murder, which followed a meeting between the two men and a third former Russian security agent, Dmitri Kovtun, at a hotel in London. "Even now I have a strange impression," said Mr Berezovsky, who did not give further details but hinted that Mr Lugovoy may have been coerced into the murder. He pointed out that the former agent had been imprisoned in 2001 after attempting to spring from jail an associate of Mr Berezovsky, the former deputy director of Aeroflot Nikolai Glushkov, who had been imprisoned for fraud. Last week Mr Berezovsky told a reporter that Mr Lugovoy's life may be in danger because he was a "witness of Putin's crime". Mr Berezovsky has frequently accused the Russian President of being behind the murder of his employee, Mr Litvinenko, who also accused Mr Putin of his murder in a deathbed statement. On Tuesday evening, he repeated the accusation but denied that he had become an embarrassing guest for Britain which granted him political asylum in 2003. In a recent interview with The Guardian, he had called for the use of force to remove President Putin from power. Mr Berezovsky argued that on the contrary, thanks to his efforts, the West was now more aware of the "real danger" posed by President Putin. "In 2001, only 10 per cent thought he was dangerous in the West. Now it is 90 per cent," Mr Berezovsky said, adding that he feared for his own safety following Mr Litvinenko's death. Asked what Britain should do if Russia continued to refuse to extradite the suspect for trial, Mr Berezovsky replied: "This is not just a problem for Britain, this is a problem for the West." He suggested that economic sanctions could be invoked. Russia points out that it is constitutionally barred from extraditing a Russian citizen for trial abroad, but has offered to put Mr Lugovoy on trial in Moscow. Britain has ruled that out.

"With Asia-Pacific now home to two thirds of the world's population, the level of progress achieved in your region will be a critical factor in determining whether our global efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will succeed or fail," he sai, in a message delivered by Jose Antonio Ocampo, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Monday. Officials from 62 United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) member governments are in Almaty for the week-long meeting 60 years after the body, then known as the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, was founded in Shanghai. The MDGs, time-bound targets for slashing poverty and other ills by the year 2015, are at the top of the meeting's agenda. "I am encouraged by the fact that, in recent decades, the countries of Asia and the Pacific have seen a record number of people lifted out of poverty," Ban said. "Still, over 600 million fellow human beings who have not benefited from the region's economic gains continue to face a daily struggle to survive," he added. He urged redoubled efforts to fight extreme poverty within UNESCAP's &#8220;Green Growth,&#8221; or environmentally sustainable approach. To help the countries which are lagging behind, government ministers from across the region have expressed support for a "road map that aims to have all countries 'marginally' off-track to be back on-track towards reaching MDGs by 2009, those 'moderately' off-track to be in line by 2011, and those in the 'severely' off-track category on target by the end of 2013. At the meeting, Kim Hak-Su, Executive Secretary of UNESCAP, applauded the endorsement of the plan. "Your commitment is vital to the regional road map," he told the ministers. "2007 marks the midway point to 2015. It is important that the countries come together to ensure the targets are met," he said. The road-map is expected to be endorsed by the Commission session when it concludes on Wednesday, 23 May.

Who's your fave? Golly! Are retro dolls racist? Are you too fat for NHS ops? McClaren: Is he a 'joke'? COMMENT ON THIS STORY BRAVE Kate McCann fought tears as she told the Pope yesterday: &#147;We need to find Madeleine.&#148; The grief-stricken mother&#146;s voice was barely audible as she made her impassioned plea. Battling to stay in control, Kate stood before His Holiness Benedict XVI during the open-air audience in historic St Peter&#146;s Square. With husband Gerry by her side, she murmured: &#147;Thank you from all of us just so want need to find Madeleine.&#148; Then her voice faltered as tears began to well, while The Pontiff stretched out his hands &#151; and gently clasped hers. The Pope whispered back his reassurance. And Kate replied: &#147;I know that. Yes.&#148; He took Gerry&#146;s hand too and the distraught dad bowed to kiss the Holy Father&#146;s. Kate offered: &#147;Father. Do you, er, want to see a picture of Madeleine?&#148; As the picture of the smiling four-year-old was passed to the Pope, he recognised it as the image that has touched millions around the world. Kate said, &#147;That&#146;s her. Yes&#148;, as she pressed it into his hands. Concern ... the Holy Father listens to Kate and, right, McCanns appeal to Italian people for help Then in a final act of comfort for the devout Roman Catholic couple, The Pope blessed the picture with a sign of the cross. &#147;Thank you,&#148; Kate whispered, her voice tailing off. The GP had been clutching Maddie&#146;s favourite pink stuffed toy, Cuddle Cat, as the Pontiff offered words of comfort. And she said of the 30-second meeting: &#147;He was very kind, very sincere. He said he would pray for us and our family and continue to have faith for us for Madeleine&#146;s safe return to us. &#147;I thanked him first of all for letting us meet him for his prayers. It has been a lovely day. &#147;It was a very positive experience. I think it has only made us stronger and lifted us up more. Maddie ... missing for past 28 days &#147;There is so much good out there. It is really evident and it has really helped us.&#148; Gerry, a hospital consultant, added: &#147;It was more personal than I could ever imagine it could have been. &#147;His touch, words and thoughts were more tender than we could have thought. &#147;In other circumstances, of course, it would be the highlight for any Catholic to meet the Pope. &#147;But it is tainted with the very marked realisation that our daughter is still missing.&#148; He added: &#147;One evil act with the abduction of Madeleine seems to have generated so much good. It has restored my faith in humanity.&#148; The couple had waited for two hours at the front of 30,000 pilgrims at the general audience. They struggled to stay composed amid the pomp and pageantry. And at one point Kate buckled when an English priest read out a special papal blessing for &#147;your children and your loved ones&#148;. They arrived in Rome on a private jet from Portugal and stayed overnight in the residence of the British Ambassador to the Vatican. And they were among only around 50 pilgrims given the honour of a personal papal meeting. Yet amid the sea of smiling faces, they stood out because of their tears. Kate stayed composed by toying with a set of black rosary beads. She frequently looked down at two photos of Maddie, while Gerry slipped a comforting arm around her waist and squeezed her shoulder. At other times he held her close whenever her burden of pain appeared too great. Kate kept her head bowed at one point as little girls &#151; not much older than Maddie &#151; laughed excitedly in seats beside her as the Pope neared. A Vatican spokesman, the Reverend Ciro Benedettini, said the Pope was happy to meet the couple after a request from British Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O&#146;Connor. He said: &#147;We are talking about a family drama that has touched world public opinion. &#147;It could not but touch the Holy Father, especially since these people are Catholics. The Holy Father is considered the father of all, therefore he was personally touched as a father.&#148; Last night the couple, from Rothley, Leicestershire, jetted back to Portugal to be reunited with their two-year-old twins Amelie and Sean. Kate said: &#147;We just can&#146;t even think about going home. Our total preoccupation is finding Madeleine. &#147;At the end of the day this is for Madeleine. I don&#146;t like talking about this publicly but you have got to put your own feelings aside. &#147;You can never lose sight of what we are trying to do &#151; find Madeleine.&#148; Gerry added: &#147;We&#146;re still in the middle of a race and we do not know how long it is going to be. I don&#146;t know how we will have changed but we will never be the same again.&#148; Email to a friend FULL MADDIE INDEX &#155;&#155; Send your messages of support.

Residents of Sadr City, the northern suburb that is a stronghold of the al-Mahdi Army, the Shia militia suspected of carrying out the abductions, said that an early morning helicopter strike had killed two people while US commanders said two suspected terrorists had been detained. Dozens of Bradley fighting vehicles and Humvees carried US troops into the Shia district last night where they continued their so-far fruitless house-to-house searches. A cleric who runs the Sadr City political office of Hojatoleslam Moqtada al-Sadr, the spiritual head of the al-Mahdi Army, said his building was stormed at 3am. Witnesses said the two people who died were an elderly couple sleeping on their roof to avoid the heat. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said there had been no major overnight developments in the search for the four British security guards and IT consultant who were taken hostage in carefully planned raid on the Iraqi Finance Ministry on Tuesday. Fears are growing for abducted Britons SAS team is diverted to join hunt Iraq holds breath before vital summer A spokeswoman said that Kim Howells, the Foreign Office Minister, was in Basra yesterday and discussed the operation to secure their release with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Hoshiyar Zebari. Meanwhile the Iraqi Government released a statement saying that a special military unit had been set up to help the search and that it had "undertaken urgent measures to determine the facts and locate the kidnappers...The government condemns this crime and is doing all it can to ensure the immediate release of the kidnapped Britons". The FCO spokeswoman said that the British diplomats and military officials in charge of the operation were keeping their minds open as to which insurgent group might have been responsible for the kidnapping, despite a leaked incident report that appeared to point the finger of blame at the al-Mahdi Army, whose Basra leader was killed in a joint British and Iraqi operation last week. "There is obviously lots of speculation but we have to keep an open mind and deal in facts rather than pick one theory over another," she said. The report, obtained by the Associated Press, was reportedly written by Fatih-Allah, the director general of the Finance Ministry's data processing centre, where the Britons were seized, and quoted the top US Commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, saying that the al-Mahdi Army &ldquo;will be profoundly sorry" if it carried out the abductions. The account of the kidnapping said that Iraq&rsquo;s Defence and Interior ministers believed the al-Mahdi Army of being behind the raid and corroborated other witness reports, which described gunmen claiming to be from the Government's anti-corruption body taking the hostages away in a convoy of 19 four-wheel-drive vehicles. The report said that a group of four men in civilian clothes reportedly scouted the Finance Ministry building 15 minutes before the larger party arrived. The al-Mahdi Army is under close scrutiny after the reappearance in Iraq last Friday of Hojatoleslam al-Sadr, their young and charismatic leader, who has been in hiding for the last four months during the massive US-Iraqi security operation considered a last-ditch attempt to stabilise the country. The militia has been reportedly frayed by the cleric's absence, fuelling speculation that the Britons were taken by an extremist splinter group. Meanwhile other reports have claimed that the kidnapping bore the hallmark of Sunni insurgents and that the al-Mahdi Army is not involved at all. In another operation in Baghdad today, US forces, backed by helicopter gunships, fought for several hours with armed men suspected of ties to al-Qaeda. Reports said that al-Qaeda militants, who consider Baghdad&rsquo;s Amariyah neighborhood part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, opened fire on students about to attend their final exams. Iraqi police said that 45 men were detained and the local leader of the militants, known as Haji Hameed, was killed. There was no comment from the US military. Outside the capital, at least 25 people were killed and 50 were wounded when a suicide bomber blew up a police recruiting centre in Fallujah, in unstable Anbar province 65km (40 miles) west of Baghdad. The recruiting centre, in a primary school, had opened on Sunday. "A cleric who runs the Sadr City political office of Hojatoleslam Moqtada al-Sadr...said his building was stormed at 3am. Witnesses said the two people who died were an elderly couple sleeping on their roof to avoid the heat." If you cannot find the abductees, might as well just kill some old people.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/14-3&fd=R&url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/world/asia/30cnd-malaysia.html&cid=1116680910&ei=m-xeRsngAYf40QHv7IzQDQ Malaysian Court Refuses to Recognize Woman&#8217;s Conversion to Christianity - New York Times Malaysian Court Refuses to Recognize Woman’s Conversion to Christianity Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 30, 2007 , May 30 — In a controversial victory for Islamic law over secularism, Malaysia’s highest court today refused to recognize the conversion of a Muslim-born woman to Christianity, ruling that the matter was beyond the jurisdiction of the country’s civil courts and should be handled by religious authorities. Muslims, who make up about 60 percent of Malaysia’s population, have co-existed with Buddhists, Christians, Hindus and Sikhs for decades in this country, considered one of the world’s most progressive and modern Muslim democracies. But the ruling here underlined the increasing separateness of Muslims from people of other religions and reinforced the notion, widely held in many Muslim countries, that Islamic law should have primacy over secular laws in certain aspects of their lives. The Federal Court was divided 2-1 in its decision, with the only non-Muslim judge, Richard Malanjum, dissenting forcefully and arguing that the Constitution must remain the supreme law of the land. The split on the court mirrored the discord in Malaysian society, where ethnic and religious tensions have begun to increase in recent years. The ruling exhausted the last appeal of Lina Joy, who, after being baptized a Roman Catholic in May 1998, wanted to remove the word “Islam” from her identity card in order to marry her Catholic fiancé. Muslims in Malaysia are subject to separate laws on inheritance and marriage — they must marry within the faith — and are not allowed to have premarital relationships or drink alcohol, among other rules. Because separate laws apply to them, Muslims must list their religion on their identity cards. Ms. Joy, who lost her job as a saleswoman last year because of the controversy and whose family has reportedly been harassed, is seeking political asylum in Australia, according to one of her advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for her. Ms. Joy’s lawyer, Benjamin Dawson, was not available after the trial to comment on the verdict or the reported asylum application. Ms. Joy was not in the courtroom today. The Malaysian chief justice, Ahmad Fairuz Abdul Halim, who read out his majority opinion in the packed but respectfully hushed courtroom, said the government agency responsible for identity cards had acted reasonably when it refused to change Ms. Joy’s religious status. ”She cannot at her own whim simply enter or leave her religion,” Mr. Ahmad said. “She must follow rules.” The Malaysian Constitution is in some ways a self-contradicting document, analysts say. It both defends freedom of religion and declares Islam the official religion. The abandonment of Islam, or apostasy, is deplored by many Muslims and in some Malaysian states is punishable by fines and imprisonment. In order for Ms. Joy to officially change her religion, Mr. Ahmad said, she must offer proof from a special Muslim court that she has abandoned Islam. “The civil courts cannot interfere,” Mr. Ahmad said. Mr. Malanjum said in his dissenting opinion that Ms. Joy’s “fundamental constitutional right of freedom of religion” had been violated. ”She is entitled to have an identity card in which the word Islam does not appear,” Mr. Malanjum said, calling the agency’s refusal to officially change her religion “an abuse of power.” Outside the courthouse, located in the heart of Malaysia’s gleaming administrative capital, jubilant members of an Islamic youth organization cheered the decision, shouting “Allah Akbar,” meaning “God is great.” “We praise Allah for the position taken by the courts,” said Yusri Mohamad, the president of the Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia. “We welcome and applaud the decision.” But representatives of other religious communities said they were dismayed. “Something needs to be done,” said Leonard Teoh Hooi Leong, a lawyer representing the Malaysia Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism. “People like Lina Joy should not be trapped in a legal cage.” In practice, Mr. Teoh said, Ms. Joy, who was born Azlina Jailani, will have a very difficult time getting the Islamic authorities to allow her to leave Islam. No one in recent years has done it in the federal territory of Kuala Lumpur, where Ms. Joy is registered, he said. Those who have tried have been “threatened and cajoled,” Mr. Teoh said. Ms. Joy’s case reflects the larger debate across the globe about the place of traditional Islamic beliefs in modern, multicultural democracies and highlights differences of opinion on the age-old question of the separation of religion and state. ”Islam in our country is not just a religion — it’s law,” said Pawancheek Marican, a Malaysian lawyer who attended the trial. The specific Malaysian subtext of today’s decision is the system of legal and political segregation between Muslims and non-Muslims here that does not exist to the same extent in other multicultural countries with Muslim populations such as India or Indonesia. Muslims in Malaysia are the main political power-brokers and the beneficiaries of a three-decade-old program of privileges for “bumiputra” — Malays and other indigenous people — who make up about 65 percent of the population and are mostly Muslims. Large companies must respect hiring quotas for bumiputra as well as ownership rules that require certain levels of indigenous ownership. But continued Malay political power is predicated on this thin majority of bumiputra, so the prospect of people like Lina Joy leaving Islam is disconcerting to the government. These economic and political stakes add tension to the religious debate, with non-Muslims — mainly ethnic Chinese and Indians — resentful of the bumiputra’s privileges and power. ”For a long time I’ve noticed there has been an increase in Islamicization and discrimination,” Mr. Dawson, Ms. Joy’s lawyer, said in an interview last year. Mr. Dawson, a Christian of mixed Chinese and Indian heritage and whose practice focuses mainly on commercial law, said he took up Ms. Joy’s case in 1999 as a sort of religious mission. “It was a calling, if you understand it from the Christian perspective,” he said. He described Ms. Joy as “a simple and ordinary person” who felt strongly about her religious beliefs.

"The Iraqi government has undertaken urgent measures to determine the facts and locate the kidnappers. It is in contact with the British authorities over any developments," the government said in a statement. A special military unit has been set up to help hunt for the Britons -- a computer expert and his four bodyguards who were snatched on Tuesday from inside a Finance Ministry building by dozens of gunmen wearing police uniforms. "The government condemns this crime and is doing all it can to ensure the immediate release of the kidnapped Britons," the statement said. A senior Finance Ministry official said the building's guards were being questioned over the raid, in which no shots were fired. Investigators will be trying to establish how the gunmen knew the Britons were in the building. One of the guards said he had been briefly detained for questioning and then released. He said other colleagues were still being held. The guard, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters the gunmen had been led by a man in a police major's uniform who spoke to the hostages in fluent English. He said he did not recognise the gunmen's weapons but they were not AK-47s, the standard-issue weapon for Iraq's security forces. Iraq's foreign minister, Hoshiyar Zebari, said on Wednesday he suspected that the Mehdi Army militia of anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr was behind the kidnapping because the ministry was close to their stronghold of Sadr City. Iraq's police are known to be heavily infiltrated by Shi'ite militias and have often been accused of carrying out kidnappings and killings. Dozens of people were seized from the Higher Education Ministry by gunmen in police uniform last year. A government official said the abductions could be in retaliation for the killing of the militia's commander in the southern city of Basra by British-backed Iraqi soldiers. Sadr has made no public comment on the abductions, but aides say the operation was beyond the capability of the Mehdi Army. U.S. and Iraqi forces have staged raids in Sadr City in their hunt for the Britons, using armoured vehicles to smash down walls of houses. The unusually heavy-handed tactics indicate the soldiers are racing to find them before they are moved, possibly out of the capital. Police said two people, a man and his son, were killed in an air strike overnight on their home in Sadr City. It was not clear if it was linked to the search for the Britons. The U.S. military said it was checking the report. In a separate statement the military said it had staged a raid in Sadr City on Thursday and detained two suspected members of a "secret cell terrorist network" responsible for bringing roadside bombs into Iraq from Iran.

'Between eight and 10 Fatah al-Islam elements were killed yesterday (Wednesday) when the army responded with direct hits to fire which was targeting its positions,' a spokesman said. Officials from the Islamist group, which has been besieged by the army at the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp since its fighters launched attacks on military targets on May 20, could not be reached for confirmation. In all, 79 people have died in the fighting, according to an Agence France-Presse count before the latest army report of casualties among the militia's ranks. He said the situation at the camp remained relatively calm today but warned: 'The situation around Nahr al-Bared is very unstable, as the extremists keep firing on the army, which responds very forcefully.' The Beirut government, pushing for a peaceful end to the standoff, has insisted the group hand over fighters to stand trial over attacks against its armed forces during the bloodiest internal fighting since the 1975-1990 civil war. But Fatah al-Islam is adamant that none of its fighters will be surrendered. 'The situation is still complicated and requires more discussions in order to close the gap between the points of views of the two sides,' Sheikh Mohamad Al-Hajj, a member of a delegation of clerics attempting to mediate for a peaceful solution, told AFP. More than two thirds of Nahr al-Bared's 31,000 residents have been displaced by the fighting, as relief agencies struggle to deliver aid to the displaced and to residents still trapped inside.

Officials say the bomber walked up to a group of people waiting in a line at the recruitment center and detonated his explosives. The U.S. military gave a lower death toll, saying that one Iraqi policeman was killed and eight people were wounded in the blast.

Thursday, May 31, 2007 - ?2005 IranMania.com LONDON, May 31 (IranMania) - Iran's top nuclear negotiator emphasized again upon arrival in Spain there is no place of A-bombs in Tehran's security doctrine, and Iran is ready to give guarantees to engaged sides in that respect, IRNA reported. Ali Larijani added here on Wednesday night, "Our viewpoint in this respect is quite clear to understand: when we say that there is no room for atomic bombs in our defensive doctrine, we truly mean it, stand up to it, and are ready to give strong guarantees that we would not move toward acquiring weapons." Secretary of Supreme National Security Council added, "Our behavior in the past, too, is best proof for this claim, since a country that is after acquiring the nuclear weapons would never sign the nuclear NPT." He reiterated, "It is highly unlikely that a country, which is under the cameras of the International Atomic Energy Agency, would manage to manufacture atomic bombs." Larijani said, "Neither our policy, nor our behavior indicate that we are after such objectives, and yet, we have proposed measures that can assure the other side that we are not going towards producing weapons." Iran's top nuclear negotiator reiterated, "The two sides' comprehensive negotiations can begin tomorrow, and these very same questions that you reporters ask today can be discussed there." In response to a question whether the nuclear issue, too, was brought up during the current week Iran-US talks in Baghdad, he said, "The nuclear issue and Iraq are two separate issues and our negotiation there with the Americans was merely on Iraq security." Larijani added, "What made us talk to the Americans was the serious ongoing crisis in our neighborhood, that is the result of Iraq's occupation over the past four years." He reiterated, "The management of the occupiers has led to the prevalence of insecurity and countless economic problems in Iraq." The SNSC Secretary said, "In response to US Administration' request, and repeated Iraqi Government requests, it was agreed that potential would be employed at the service of improving security in Iraq in a bid to improve the Iraqi nation's living conditions." Larijani said that meeting with the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who would be visiting Madrid officially this Friday is not in his agenda. Larijani is scheduled to begin negotiations with EU Foreign Policy Chief Javier Solana in Madrid on Thursday evening, simultaneously with the arrival of the French President Nicholas Sarkozy's arrival in the Spanish capital, and a day before Condoleezza Rice's arrival there.

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18945566/site/newsweek/&cid Hirsh: Icy G8 Meeting for U.S., Russia - Newsweek Michael Hirsh - MSNBC.com Letters & Live Talks Compared to a decade or so ago, the belief in the messianic power of democracy and markets has reached a new low. Why another face-off between Washington and Moscow isnâ€™t as impossible as you might think. By By Michael Hirsh May 30, 2007 - It wasnâ€™t like Harry and â€œUncle Joeâ€ at all. Or was it? Sixty-two years ago, here at Potsdam, Harry Truman and Joe Stalin seemed to get along famously, putting on a display of bonhomie that belied how fast their relationship was about to go into a deep freeze. During the conference after the surrender of Nazi Germany, the U.S. president quietly received a message that said, â€œBabies satisfactorily born,â€ meaning the worldâ€™s first successful atomic test had just occurred at Los Alamos, N.M. The cold warâ€”and the start of a four-decadelong arms raceâ€”was just a year or so away. On Wednesday, representatives of the major powers met again in the Berlin suburb of Potsdam, this time for a G8 meeting. Such gatherings are typically relentlessly amiable, and so the delegates tried to make it this time. But beneath the forced grins, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov exchanged icy, even scary, words that suggested a new cold war is not inconceivable. â€œThe arms race is starting again,â€ Lavrov said flatly. The immediate issue was a missile-defense shield that Washington is trying to set up in Poland and the Czech Republic. Rice, in remarks the day before on her plane, had dismissed Russian concerns that the shield was aimed at Moscow as â€œludicrous.â€ The United States only intended to guard against nukes from smaller countries like North Korea and Iran, she said. But Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is still steamed over George W. Bush's unilateral withdrawal from the antiballistic-missile treaty, warned Washington against turning Europe into a â€œpowder kegâ€ and promptly fired off a new test ICBM. His deputy prime minister and putative successor, Sergei Ivanov, boasted that Russia â€œhas new tactical and strategic complexes that are capable of overcoming any existing or future missile-defense systems." Asked about Riceâ€™s comments at Potsdam, Foreign Minister Lavrov was cuttingâ€”and uncompromising. â€œThere is nothing ludicrous aboutâ€ Russiaâ€™s concerns, he snapped. The U.S. secretary of State, seeking desperately to keep the atmosphere light-hearted, tried a mild joke (to the extent that mass destruction can be funny). â€œI would note that President Putin said yesterday that Russia would ... destroy any shield,â€ she said. â€œWe quite agree.â€ There were a few chuckles in the room. But the laughing ended when Lavrov said: â€œI hope that nobody has to actually prove that Condiâ€™s right about that.â€ This is rough language indeed for a meeting thatâ€™s supposed to represent the calm â€œworld of â€˜post-historyâ€™,â€ where great nations rise above such petty threats and make war no more. The atmosphere between Washington and Moscow has grown so tenseâ€”not only over this, but over Putinâ€™s bullying on energy supplies, over continuing aggressive U.S. moves to bring former Soviet satellites and states into NATO, and over smaller issues like independence for Kosovoâ€”that Bush resorted to the only card he has left, his still-cordial personal relationship with the Russian president. The White House abruptly announced Wednesday that the president was inviting Putin to the Bush family home in Kennebunkport, Maine, for two days in July. As if sensing that things had spiraled out of control in Potsdam, Rice interrupted the end of the news conference Wednesday to deliver what an aide described an impromptu confirmation of the visit. In Maine, Lavrov added humorlessly, â€œAll sorts of areas where our positions do not coincide will be discussed.â€ Get alerted to the latest from Newsweek's columnists through your MSN or Windows Messenger, your e-mail or your mobile device.

Kate and Gerry McCann both shed tears at times during the general audience in St Peter&rsquo;s Square at the Vatican. But afterwards they insisted it had been a positive experience and provided great strength as they continued the hunt for their missing daughter. Four-year-old Madeleine was snatched four weeks ago today from the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz. Yesterday her parents sat just 20 yards away from the Holy Father during the religious ceremony before speaking to him for a little less than 30 seconds. He prayed with both of them, while Mr McCann bowed and kissed his hand. Looking solemnly at the couple, he leant forward to bless a photograph of Madeleine. Mr McCann said afterwards: &ldquo;It was more personal than I could ever imagine it could have been. There was recognition immediately, looking at Madeleine&rsquo;s photograph. His touch, words and thoughts were more tender than we could have thought.&rdquo; His wife added: &ldquo;It was very emotional but it was a very positive experience really, it has been very helpful to us. He was very kind, he said he would pray for us and our family and continue to have faith for us.&rdquo; The couple said they had mixed emotions about being at the Vatican because it was tinged with sadness that Madeleine is still missing. Mr McCann said: &ldquo;In other circumstances of course it would be the highlight for any Catholic to meet the Pope. &ldquo;It is tainted with the very marked realisation that our daughter is still missing.&rdquo; Mr McCann said the most difficult aspect of Madeleine&rsquo;s abduction was not knowing where she is. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still in the middle of a race and we do not know how long it is going to be. I do not know how we will have changed but I think it is fair to say we will never be the same again.&rdquo; At one point in yesterday&rsquo;s ceremony, an English-speaking priest issued a prayer on behalf of the Pope to the 35,000-strong crowd, saying: &ldquo;In a special way his blessing goes to your children and your loved ones.&rdquo; His words proved too much for the British couple from Rothley in Leicestershire who struggled to compose themselves, wiping back the tears with their heads bowed. For much of the audience Mrs McCann, with the now standard green and yellow ribbons in her hair fluttering in the breeze, kept her eyes closed. Her husband offered continuous support, slipping his arm round her waist and squeezing her shoulder. But he too at times succumbed to tears. Despite their struggle during the event, Mrs McCann seemed stronger and more composed as she spoke at a packed press conference afterwards. Describing what she said to the Holy Father, she said: &ldquo;I thanked him first of all for letting us meet him and I thanked him for his prayers. &ldquo;It has been a very positive experience and it has helped us &ndash; it can only make us stronger and lifted us up more.&rdquo; for irishexaminer.com stories before this date Anti-poverty group urges action by next government 'Character' Bellamy to skipper Wales Search on for passengers who sat near TB man Paris up at closing Halo 2 out on June 8 Let Darina Allen and co tickle your palate We'll help you make &copy Examiner Publications (Cork) Limited, City Quarter, Lapps Quay, Cork.

The views expressed are the author's alone. BEIRUT, 31 May 2007 (IRIN) - With no immediate end in sight to the stand-off between the army and Islamist militants in Nahr al-Bared refugee camp in northern Lebanon, and with neighbouring Beddawi camp already full to bursting, aid agencies have delivered relief to several hundred families displaced further to the east and south of the country. According to figures from the UN Palestinian relief organisation UNRWA, some 309 families, or about 1,500 people, have fled Nahr al-Bared for the camps of Borj Barajneh, Shatila and Mar Elias, located in and around Beirut. Sixty-one families have fled the north for the eastern Bekaa valley, staying with host families in villages or in the Wavel camp, while in the south 90 displaced families are being hosted by relatives in Rashadiyeh and Al-Buss camps in and around Tyre. A further 120 families have found shelter in Sidon city or Ein al-Helwe camp. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has delivered food and hygiene kits to scores of displaced Palestinian families in and around various refugee camps across the south and east of Lebanon over the past few days. On 31 May it distributed a further 20,000 litres of water and 800 hygiene kits into Nahr al-Bared camp, through its partners in the Palestinian Popular Committee. Sultan Abul Aynan, overall commander in Lebanon of the secular and dominant Palestinian faction Fatah, told IRIN that all of Lebanon's 12 refugee camps - home to just over half the country's 400,000 Palestinians - remained on a high security alert, but played down the prospects of further security breakdowns. Under a 1969 Arab agreement, the Lebanese army may surround but does not enter any of the camps, leaving security inside to the Palestinians. "The situation in the camps is under control and the Lebanese army is allowing us to get our necessary supplies," Abul Aynan said. UNRWA is now taking the lead on delivering aid to the estimated 20,000 people displaced to Beddawi camp, 10km from Nahr al-Bared, and to those who fled further south. Water and electricity services at Beddawi camp, which is just two kilometres square and whose original population numbered about 16,000, are struggling under the strain of the huge influx. The agency's single clinic in Beddawi camp is now running 12 hours a day in an effort to meet the huge extra demands. UNRWA said it is looking into the possibility of erecting prefabricated temporary accommodation on the edge of the camp and installing mobile generators, portable showers, toilets and water tanks. Some Palestinians quoted in local media reports, however, rejected the proposal, fearing it could encourage the full-scale destruction of Nahr al-Bared camp and decrease their chances of returning home. "The needs in Beddawi are still very great," said Hoda al-Turk, spokeswoman for UNRWA in Lebanon. "The food situation is alright but we still face a lack of clothes and hygiene kits."

But, seriously, I don't see why this is such a horrible protest. Just because the meat is from a dog some people think is cute doesn't make it worse than eating, say, deer. Deer are cute, too. The sport of fox hunting is an elitist activity by people who live off the labor of other people. People should protest it - as well as the monarchy. A vegetarian forcing her/himself to consume meat is a serious sacrifice, so it's heartfelt. Bottomline: It got everyone's attention. And that is, afterall, what protest is supposed to do.

May 20 was the anniversary of the formation of Iraq's first fully elected and constitutional government, led by Nouri al-Maliki. Today, the Maliki government is virtually nonexistent, and Iraq is in chaos. June 5-6 will be the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of the 1967 Six-Day War. That was a conflict precipitated by Egypt in which a victorious Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza. After decades of inconclusive peace talks, Israel still effectively controls these territories. An elected Palestinian Authority is on the verge of collapse, and near anarchy reigns in Gaza. Iraq and Gaza represent a frightening trend toward disintegration in the region, especially in places where elections have replaced Arab autocrats. On my trip to Israel, Jordan, Iraq and Syria, I plan to examine whether there's any way to enhance stability in the Middle East. I'm not very optimistic. In the wake of the Iraq war and the breakdown of any Israeli-Palestinian peace process, my Mideast contacts say the regional chaos will only get worse.I was in Baghdad last year when the Maliki government took office. It was clear that this was a government in name only. The constitutional system the U.S. helped set up creates a weak prime minister with little power. Congress and the White House can demand benchmarks, but Maliki can't deliver. Iraq shows the fallacy of White House dreams of social engineering. Many of the Middle East's authoritarian regimes -- like Egypt and Syria -- are fragile and dependent on the military and secret police to keep power. But knocking off a dictator, in states where no civic institutions have been allowed to grow, won't create a democratic nirvana -- especially when religious political parties are the strongest political forces, and best positioned to win the vote. I'm returning to Baghdad to see if there is the slightest chance Iraq's political leaders can come together to stop the sectarian killing. Are two states still possible? The tragic situation on the West Bank and in Gaza also reflects misunderstanding of the region. The death of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat offered the White House the last best chance to encourage a two-state solution. It passed up the chance. Arafat's successor, Mahmoud Abbas, and his Palestinian Authority were weak, but Abbas was committed to two states, side by side. Had Gaza been returned to him via peace talks, his Fatah party would have been strengthened -- and Hamas undermined. Instead, the U.S. backed Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to withdraw unilaterally from Gaza. This bolstered Hamas' argument that their violent tactics drove out the Israelis. The undercutting of Abbas led to the predictable disintegration of the Palestinian Authority. Even as President Bush was telling Americans that Gaza would morph into a model democracy, its impoverished society was collapsing. Its people, desperate for services, voted for Hamas. A trip to Israel on the 40th anniversary of the Six-Day War must focus on the future of the West Bank and Gaza. I want to hear whether Israelis and Palestinian have any new ideas about how to create two states -- or whether this concept is no longer valid. The answer is crucial for the entire Middle East and for U.S. interests in the region. If the two-state solution is dead, Palestinian society will fragment further under Israeli control. That, in turn, would inspire Palestinian Islamists to strike out with greater ferocity at Israel and beyond. It is this fragmentation that creates breeding grounds for small and violent Islamist groups -- the most frightening trend in the region. Such groups are far more difficult to deal with than rulers of states. When Israel fought the Six-Day War, it fought regimes with recognized leaders with whom it could negotiate a truce or a peace. I am heading for a region where splinter groups -- in Iraq, in Lebanon, in Gaza -- can hold off armies and have no desire to negotiate. The most urgent question in today's Middle East is how to counter that trend -- and whether diplomacy can succeed where military might cannot.

From left, Skye Bortoli and Ayesha Future are in Anchorage campaigning to save whales. IN THE winter of 2004, a humpback whale slid below the swell at Byron Bay in northern New South Wales, just as a camera shutter clicked. Humpback tails are as individual as faces or fingerprints, and this tail was particularly elegant. Wide, symmetrical and creamy white, it was unmarked by the frequent scars of battle and survival. A thin, dark line traced the tail's trailing edge, which swept out to finely balanced fluke tips. At a notch midway between the tips were two small dots - flaws in the perfection. Photo identification is a widely used tool to discover more about the lives of humpbacks, and the Australian researchers kept this picture in a catalogue. Recently it was matched with two other images: one at Hervey Bay in Queensland 14 months later and another shot by a New Zealander at the Balleny Islands, in Antarctica, in February last year. The same whale is unmistakable in each image, even to a layman. The subtle confirmation is those two dots. The images of this whale were recorded in a scientific paper and put before the International Whaling Commission. They confirm a legend, tell of the real link Australians are building with these animals, and point to conflict ahead. The legend was that the Ballenys forsaken, isolated rock outcrops on the edge of the Ross Sea were a reliable waypoint for humpbacks on the annual migration to and from Antarctica. Here was solid evidence. The link came through years of collecting tail fluke ID photographs, and months of skilled analysis to match the images - sifting needles from the pictorial haystack. In those collections, two other tails were found at the Ballenys, about 5000 kilometres from their Australian haunts. This is a reminder that among an estimated 7000 east Australian humpbacks and perhaps 14,000 that call the west coast home, as many as one in five has been photographed, and so is a known individual. And that points to the conflict. This week at the IWC gathering in Anchorage, Alaska, Australia and other anti-whaling nations are trying to persuade Japan not to harpoon these humpbacks next summer. If they fail, the odds are that in places where the whalers normally hunt - such as the Ballenys - about 10 of the Japanese haul of 50 will be these known individuals. Aside from their deaths by harpoon, they will be points of scientific light extinguished, no longer illuminating the little that is known about their travels. And by some Australians they will also be mourned. A 14-year-old Aboriginal girl from Port Stephens, NSW, carried wisdom far beyond her years to the IWC meeting this week. She was there to plead, with her friends, for the humpbacks. "These are our humpbacks," said Skye Bortoli. "The first thing they see when they come from their mother's womb is the Australian coastline. So if anyone should determine what happens to them, it's us." But the fate of these humpback whales depends on international manoeuvrings, public policy and direct intervention. At the IWC, there is Japan's drive to resume commercial whaling, and the future of the organisation itself. An electoral contest is also developing between Labor and the Coalition over whaling that may spur greater action. And if all of these developments fail to halt the harpoons, there are the protest ships. Sea Shepherd found and attacked the Japanese fleet last summer - at the Ballenys. Humpbacks first appeared on the Japanese list when it unveiled an increased "research" plan in 2005. It trialled the plan over the next two years with fin whales, partly to determine whether it could handle whales larger than minkes on the factory ship Nisshin Maru. From next summer it would mean killing up to 935 minkes, 50 fin whales, which are second only to the blue in size, and 50 humpbacks. Japan maintains that it is trying to determine whether there has been a shift in the population balance. It claims the fully protected humpbacks, and also fin whales, are now out-competing minkes. Despite the apparent conflict with this theory, it also doubled its minke kill. This week - even though it lost weeks of "research" to a fatal ship fire, and only took three of 10 planned fins (the largest was a pregnant female weighing a hefty 65 tonnes) - Japanese officials formally concluded that the feasibility study worked. The Nisshin Maru has been repaired and will go ahead with the full program, whaling across a vast stretch of ocean far south of Australia. It has been a growing and multi-pronged campaign on the part of Japan. In "diplomatic" terms, it reached its zenith at the 2006 IWC meeting. The pro-whaling side won a non-binding vote that declared the moratorium on commercial whaling was no longer necessary. Anti-whaling nations, however, responded to the shock outcome by recruiting their own new members this year, welcoming aboard Greece, Slovenia, Ecuador, Cyprus and Croatia. This week more than 70 nations came to the meeting in Anchorage. Even before the delegates arrived, there were signs that the IWC's strange international vote race may be ending. Each side held its own think tank earlier this year on how to reform the organisation. They independently agreed on some things, such as the need to reduce the level of insults and confrontation in its meetings. The usually strident Japanese delegation withdrew some of its normal demands and its leader, Joji Morishita, surprised reporters by declaring: "Actually, I'm not interested in the numbers game any more." The issue that had threatened to blow up for the US hosts, a quota of bowhead whales for Alaskan Eskimos, was defused with Japan before the meeting began. Instead, the two early pressure points have been the Southern Ocean humpback hunt, and a long-standing Japanese bid to gain a minke whale quota for its small, remnant coastal whaling industry. Morishita, the cool, greying face of Japanese whaling diplomacy, made it clear that this coastal minke catch was important to his whaling industry. "Japan believes the fate of this proposal will test whether the IWC can be revived as a responsible international organisation." If the addition of humpbacks to its scientific research was Japan's bargaining chip to allow the coastal catch, it failed. Anti-whaling nations said as a group that this was commercial whaling, not the indigenous subsistence hunt that it was claimed to be. And there would be no whale-trading. Patrick Ramage, from the International Fund for Animal Welfare, called Japan's proposal a bad joke. "It's the equivalent of a robber coming in to your house and saying 'you know what? I'm going to take a few less of your family heirlooms this year. Why don't you do something in return.' " Australian Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull ruled out support of anything but the indigenous subsistence hunt. Instead, with the New Zealand Conservation Minister, Chris Carter, he turned up the heat on Japan. The two ministers asked it to call off the humpback hunt as a gesture of goodwill. Turnbull said the humpbacks should be seen as part of the life of Australia's coastal communities. "What we have been saying privately and publicly to our friends in Japan is that the inclusion of the humpbacks is a highly provocative act," he said. "It is calculated to undermine dramatically the standing, the affection, the relationship between Australia and the Japanese people." In the face of these public warnings, Morishita kept open his offer of talks on the issue, which Australia and New Zealand took up. The first round left Turnbull sounding gloomy. "No one has changed the Japanese mind here for what, 20 years? So you'd have to be quite an optimist to believe that you could change their mind in the course of 24 hours." But as the meeting rolled on, Japan softened its demand for the coastal hunt, raising hope among conservationists. "I think we may soon have a deal," Ramage said. Turnbull stayed bullish: "The Japanese are really trying to use the humpbacks as hostages. Let's be honest. In effect, we are seeing a return to the pre-IWC days of unilateral whaling." But he insisted he was also willing to talk. If the humpback hunt is not dropped by Japan, it threatens to become an obstacle for the Howard Government at the federal election. As green issues go, climate and water far outrank whaling today. But Australians still love their whales. An independent Galaxy opinion poll for the conservation group Australians for Animals recently found that only 11 per cent of Australians believed the Howard Government was doing enough to protect humpbacks, and 81 per cent wanted it to do more. The poll found that 77 per cent of Australians approved of the ALP policy to take Japan to international courts. Within a week of this finding, Labor upped the ante. Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd released a policy declaring illegal the killing of whales by Japan in waters claimed as an Australian Whale Sanctuary off the Australian Antarctic Territory. Controversially, it also said that Labor would enforce Australian law prohibiting whaling in these waters, monitor whalers operating there, and maintain the option of boarding their ships. The use of the navy was an option, and evidence gathered could be used in an international court case. Japan repeatedly refused to comment on the Labor policy, though Turnbull quickly attacked it as suggesting high-seas piracy. However the idea of putting extra heat on Japan in the Antarctic resonated in some government seats with whale-watching interests. The parliamentary secretary for industry, Bob Baldwin, said it would be a good use of taxpayers' money to give the new Antarctic air link the task of detecting whaling ships in order to name and shame them. Meanwhile, the perils of human control over humpback whales are being driven home at the IWC. The Caribbean island of St Vincent was given the right to catch up to four a year in a hotly opposed indigenous hunt. The history of this hunt is younger than the 1851 novel Moby Dick. The inadequate weapons used mean protracted deaths for the humpbacks, usually female. And the whale is consumed in a beachside barbecue, complete with plentiful liquor stalls and gawping tourists. In an effort to find some harmony in the IWC, Australia joined in approving St Vincent's new quota. The consensus was greeted with applause. The International Whaling Commission was set up in 1946 to "manage the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry". It failed at the task as whale stocks were devastated in the mid-20th century, leading to the moratorium on commercial whaling that came into force in 1986. The only permitted whaling quotas are for aboriginal subsistence whaling. About 360 whales were hunted under that category in the past year. Japan, however, has used the IWC's "scientific research" loophole to license its own whaling. It kills about 1000 whales a year - mainly minkes. Controversially, this year, it has added 50 humpbacks to its list. Yesterday, the IWC passed a resolution condemning Japan's scientific slaughter of whales and calling for its end. But the only way to close the loophole is to have every nation agree to change the IWC's founding convention. There are now 77 member nations in the IWC, broadly split into pro and anti-whaling camps. A handful of countries are neutral. Australia is among the anti-whaling group. In the year since the last meeting, a total of 1616 whales were reported hunted and killed to the IWC. Andrew Darby is The Age's Hobart correspondent.

May. 30 2007 8:00 AM ET The parents of four-year-old Madeleine McCann, who disappeared during a family vacation in Portugal on May 3, visited the Vatican today and met with Pope Benedict XVI. Kate and Gerry McCann, both devout Catholics, shook hands with the Pope as he made his way through a large crowd at the end of his general audience in St. Peter's Square. Then they handed the Pontiff a picture of their daughter. "The Pope put his hand on the photo, he blessed the photo and then spoke to the parents for a few minutes," Vatican Affairs Correspondent Gerry O'Connell told CTV Newsnet Wednesday. Kate, carrying a pink, fluffy toy cat belonging to her missing daughter, appeared to be holding back tears during the brief encounter. Madeleine's father kissed the Pope's hands. "You could see from their faces they were really torn with sorrow, they were appealing to the Pope," O'Connell said from Rome. Before the encounter, Madeleine's parents said they hoped to draw strength from their meeting as well as to help keep the campaign to find their daughter in the media spotlight. "We have mixed emotions about being here," Madeleine's father, Gerry, told reporters as he and his wife arrived to attend the Pope's general audience. "Under normal circumstances it would be one of the most exciting things we could do in our own lifetime, but very much on our minds is the fact that we're here without Madeleine." Madeleine vanished after her parents left her, and her brother and sister -- both aged 2 -- alone while they went to a nearby restaurant within their hotel complex in the Algarve. British media have reported $2.6 million pounds (Cdn$6.1 million dollars) has been contributed to a reward fund from citizens and celebrities such as J.K. Rowling and Sir Richard Branson. The McCanns said they would not return to the U.K. until their daughter was found. They are set to return to southern Portugal later Wednesday and are also planning trips to Madrid on Friday and Berlin on June 4.

http://www.smh.com.au/news/editorial/let-the-balibo-cards-fall-where-they-may/2007/05/31/1180205422168.html&cid Let the Balibo cards fall where they may - Editorial - Opinion - smh.com.au Welcome to The Sydney Morning Herald. Let the Balibo cards fall where they may THE commander of an Indonesian special forces unit accused of murdering five Australia-based journalists in East Timor in 1975 has more lately styled himself as a champion of free speech. Mohammed Yunus Yosfiah was a captain when Indonesian forces overran Balibo in October 1975 and, according to evidence before an inquest into the deaths of the five men, was first to fire on at least three of the journalists as they tried to surrender. Under the former Indonesian strongman Soeharto, Yosfiah rose to the rank of lieutenant-general, but as Soeharto's authoritarian regime crumbled in 1998 Yosfiah quickly re-invented himself as a political reformist. As the first post-Soeharto information minister it was Yosfiah who abolished decades of censorship, media licensing restrictions and harassment of the press in one fell swoop. This recent history is worth recalling in assessing the latest howls of protest from the Indonesian Government and a couple of hundred angry protesters in Jakarta. Democracy in Indonesia is now almost a decade old. For Jakarta to profess such profound offence over the request for an Indonesian official to testify at the inquest during a recent visit to Sydney - and to continue to insist the Balibo case is closed - is an unfortunate flashback to the darker days of the Soeharto era. The proper legal process unfolding in Sydney is nothing more than the long overdue airing of a tragic truth. Whatever predictable diplomatic row now ensues, the core issue is this: respect for judicial processes and freedom of information in a democracy is not selective - no matter how unpalatable the truth or how prominent the officials involved. Certainly, the evidence before the coronial inquest in Sydney tells a grim story. It wholeheartedly damns the Indonesian military and the Soeharto government, but it also does Australia's politicians and policy makers of the era no credit. At the centre is Yosfiah, identifiable from evidence before the coroner as one of two individuals who the counsel assisting the coroner believes could be successfully prosecuted for war crimes under the Geneva Conventions - although as a mere captain at the time he was almost certain to have been acting on orders. Yosfiah has always denied any involvement, and the Indonesian government has consistently claimed the men died in crossfire - a position earlier Australian inquiries have endorsed despite intelligence reports to the contrary. Yosfiah and a second man, Christoforus da Silva, are highly unlikely to ever face an Australian court, because this would require Jakarta's co-operation in extradition. This reality does not undermine the value of the inquest. As truth commissions in nations such as South Africa and El Salvador have shown, the mere process of airing the truth is immensely important for surviving family members and in establishing credible historical records. In East Timor, where the 24-year Indonesian military occupation cost some 200,000 lives, only a handful of local Timorese have been jailed for their part in decades of terrible human rights abuses. And Dili has pragmatically chosen not to pursue senior Indonesian officials. Australia, however, has no such need to kowtow to a sensitive Jakarta over such a clear violation. When Indonesia launched its full-scale invasion in December 1975, seven weeks after the Balibo raid, a plaintive cry was picked up by radio in Darwin: "They are trying to take over all Timor &#133; Indonesians &#133; SOS, please help us." But Australia was well aware of the illegal invasion plan and willing to turn a blind eye, over decades, to avoid offending the powerful Soeharto regime. It was also argued in 1975 that Australia had reasonably feared instability in the former Portuguese colony off its northern coastline and so preferred East Timor's incorporation into the Indonesian state. Realpolitik leads governments to make many difficult choices, but Australia's stance on East Timor arguably weighed the interests of the state too heavily against fundamental values of human rights and international law. The former prime minister Gough Whitlam referred to the five journalists as "foolhardy" and criticised them for not heeding warnings to leave East Timor. Journalists should not expect special privileges in a war zone but, like civilians, they must not be deliberately targeted. The revelation at the inquest that "nearly everybody in a position to know" in Canberra believed the five men had been deliberately killed - while the government peddled the crossfire line - discredits a succession of Australian officials. In retrospect, Australia's complicity in the occupation probably exacerbated bilateral tensions, rather than smoothed them, because of the endless protests it provoked in Australia. After more than three decades, and much cynical obfuscation on both sides of the Timor Sea, a credible, if deeply disturbing, picture is finally emerging of how the Channel Seven reporter Greg Shackleton, 27, cameraman Gary Cunningham, 27, and sound recordist Tony Stewart, 21, and Nine cameraman Brian Peters, 29, and reporter Malcolm Rennie, 28, died. Whether the visiting Governor of Jakarta, Sutiyoso, who was a special forces officer at Balibo, should have been approached in his hotel this week is a side issue. Indonesia is a democracy. Indonesia's press is free to criticise Australia, and it does so with vigour. Indonesian courts are free to prosecute Australians within their jurisdiction, and they do. Mr Sutiyoso is an aspiring presidential candidate who well understands the demands of democratic openness. He is perfectly entitled to feel "deeply humiliated". However, if any apology is due it is only because the police may have let themselves into his hotel room using a master key.

Mr Abhisit yesterday called on the Council for National Security junta to lift its embargo on public political activities and to allow members of the banned Thai Rak Thai party to form new groups. "We encourage the regime to open up a political space, to remove restrictions on the formation of new parties, to allow supporters of Thai Rak Thai to regroup and use the parliamentary system," said Mr Abhisit. "The country needs at this moment stability by setting a clear road map for democracy," he told the CNBC satellite news service. "Even the military must now feel the pressure. The experience of the last six to seven months has proved there is no other alternative to democracy to restore stability and solve (our) economic problems." CNS chief General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, who overthrew Thaksin Shinawatra's Thai Rak Thai government on September 19, said he would consult military-appointed prime minister General Surayud Chulanont about lifting the political activities ban within a fortnight. The generals have offered a tentative timetable for a popular vote on a new draft constitution in September and national elections, though under sharply different conditions from the 1997 constitution, by mid-December. The junta had been awaiting Wednesday night's Constitutional Tribunal verdicts before taking further steps towards the promised restoration of a democratic government. The tribunal's decisions to sustain allegations of electoral abuses against Thai Rak Thai during the abortive April 2006 election campaign but to exonerate the Democrats has left 50-year-old Mr Abhisit as Thailand's only likely next prime minister. As a result of Wednesday's rulings, described by one Bangkok pundit as "a political massacre", Mr Thaksin and 110 other Thai Rak Thai executives - the politicians who ran Thailand from early 2001 until the coup - have been banned from politics for the next five years. Chaturon Chaisaeng, Thai Rak Thai's acting leader while Mr Thaksin remains indefinitely based in London, said in a statement yesterday the party was looking at ways of challenging the banning orders. Mr Chaturon was apparently relying on reports that the tribunal's decision to convict Thai Rak Thai and exonerate the Democrats was not unanimous. However, the interim national constitution allows no appeal against a tribunal decision. At best, Thai Rak Thai supporters can hope to be allowed to register a new party in the same name as the dissolved group. Their only recourse appears to be a direct appeal to the interim government, which is filled with Mr Thaksin's opponents. However, the military and the interim government remain wary of provoking widespread civil disobedience among supporters of Mr Thaksin, who remains widely popular, especially among Thailand's poor rural dwellers. In its judgment on Wednesday night, the Constitution Tribunal acknowledged Thai Rak Thai's membership still numbered 14 million, in a total population of 61.5 million. The military and police maintained tight security in the capital yesterday, although by the evening none of the feared mass demonstrations by Thai Rak Thai supporters had eventuated. Mr Thaksin in London yesterday released a message urging his supporters to accept the tribunal ruling and calling on the junta to convene elections as soon as possible. "Although I announced that I would wash my hands out of politics, I would like to urge (party) members to work and implement political activities for the sake of the country and the people," he said in a letter read out in Bangkok by his lawyer, Noppadon Pattama. The 57-year-old former telecommunications tycoon, whose party in 2005 was the first in Thai electoral history to win an absolute majority of votes and seats, apologised to his supporters that their efforts had come to such an end.

At the end of his weekly Wednesday general audience, after giving his catechism and greeting the crowds in several languages, Pope Benedict XVI went up to the section reserved for special guests and greeted people lined up to see him. Kate and Gerry McCann, both Catholics, waited for their turn with particularly mixed emotions. "In normal circumstances it could be one of the most exciting things we could do in our own lifetime but the fact remains we are here without Madeleine," Gerry McCann told journalists in front of St. Peter's Basilica just before the audience. "This is a very nerve-racking experience." The Pope was shaking hands, smiling and waving as he made his way along but the mood changed dramatically when he was introduced by his secretary to the McCanns. Both dressed in dark suits (Kate McCann was wearing a rosary around her neck and a green ribbon in her hair) the couple stood apparently on the verge of tears as the Pope approached them and took their hands. Gerry McCann quickly kissed the Pope's ring and Kate McCann quietly listened to the Pope's words and almost in a whisper asked him if he would bless "a picture of Maddie." The Pontiff gently stroked the photo and made the sign of the cross. He then turned to Gerry McCann and squeezed his hands at length. Gerry McCann was holding Madeleine's favorite stuffed animal, her Cuddle cat. He seemed too upset to speak. At a news conference in Rome after the meeting, Kate McCann said the Pope "was very kind, very sincere," and said that he told them he would continue to pray for Madeleine's return. Gerry McCann was touched by how personal the Pope had been. "His touch and thoughts and words were more tender than we could have hoped, and that will sustain us during this most difficult time," he said.

Protesters denouncing Thailand's junta braved a security clampdown in Bangkok after a ruling barring the ousted prime minister and his party from elections cast uncertainty on the country's political future. Protesters denouncing Thailand's junta braved a security clampdown here Thursday after a ruling barring the ousted prime minister and his party from elections cast uncertainty on the country's political future. About 1,000 people wearing yellow headbands and chanting "Junta -- get out!" gathered at a central Bangkok intersection hemmed in by hundreds of police who refused to let the demonstration move. "We are not allowing them to hold rally," said Colonel Supisarn Bhakdinarinach, metropolitan police spokesman. The turnout was smaller than that expected by the authorities, who earlier said they were expecting thousands of Thai Rak Thai (TRT) members to join a rally by a group supporting ex-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Army chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin told AFP said an indefinite crackdown had been imposed with extra checkpoints and other security measures, and with Thaksin's "hardcore" allies under close watch. "Security measures have been stepped up since last night and will gradually be increased. The measures will be in place for a long time," said the general, who led the coup against Thaksin in September. Thaksin, now living in London, apologised to his party over the court ruling handed down late Wednesday. "I, as founder and leader of the party ... apologise to all party members, executives and supporters who have met with this unexpected fate," he wrote in a letter handed out to media. Thaksin's party was found guilty of fraud in April 2006 elections, which were later annulled amid a flurry of allegations of wrongdoing. The court, which was appointed by the junta, dissolved the party and banned Thaksin and other party leaders from politics for five years. "The Thai Rak Thai party did not respect the rule of law," one judge said, adding that it "cannot exist as a political party." Analysts said the move raised question marks over the credibility of polls and the restoration of democracy promised by the military junta. "I think it is going to be very rocky, very turbulent, unless they can win over Thai Rak Thai voters," said political analyst Thitinan Pongsudhirak at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. "They have not made any effort to do that. ... There is a big gap here, there is a neglected electorate," he added. Chaturon Chaisang, the current leader of TRT, on Thursday called the verdict an attempt to punish elected leaders. "It's as if my party members were executed for breaking a glass window while those who made the rules had burned down the house," the former deputy prime minister told media. "We are banned from politics ... by orders of a military regime which destroyed democracy," he said. The TRT leader also urged the movement's estimated 14 million loyalists to respect the ruling for the sake of national stability. Authorities deployed hundreds of police on the streets and some 15,000 soldiers on alert ahead of the ruling, and Prime Minister Surayad Chulanont has said he may impose a state of emergency if there is any unrest. Some ordinary Thais felt the TRT had been unfairly singled out by Thailand's military-backed government, as the rival Democrat Party was cleared of fraud by the same tribunal. "The ruling was definitely influenced by the military rulers. They are afraid that Thaksin would come back to take revenge," motorcycle taxi driver Boonsri Wheankaew told AFP. "The verdict is not fair as only the TRT is banned but the Democrat Party survives," said the 39 year-old. Democrat leader Abhisit Vejjajiva thanked the tribunal and said his four-million-strong party was looking forward to the December polls. "Tomorrow we will have a more important mission, that is to swiftly restore democratic rule under the constitution," he said. Three minor parties were dissolved by the tribunal, which also found them guilty of fraud connected to the April 2006 polls.

http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/67528.html&cid Malaysian court rejects conversion appeal of Muslim woman Malaysian court rejects conversion appeal of Muslim woman Wed, 30 May 2007 06:42:00GMT Legal General News | Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia's top court on Wednesday rejected the appeal of a woman to be recognised as a Christian in a landmark case highlighting religious controversies in this mainly-Muslim nation. Lina Joy, who was born a Muslim and known as Azlina Jailani, had applied for both her name and religion to be changed on her identity card in 1999. While allowing her name-change, the National Registration Department refused to drop her religion as Muslim from the identity card, saying she had to appeal to the Islamic sharia courts. However, Joy embarked on a legal battle in the secular courts, arguing that she was a Christian and therefore no longer bound by Islamic law. A three-panel judge on Wednesday ruled by a 2-1 majority that only the Islamic Sharia Court has the power to allow her to remove the word "Islam" from the religion category on her identity card. Dissenting Judge Richard Malanjum said it was unconstitutional for the registry department to insist that Joy turn to the Sharia Court, were she was likely to face criminal prosecution for seeking to convert. Malanjum ruled that she was "entitled to have an identity card where the word Islam does not appear" as she had converted to Christianity. Malaysia's Islamic courts have a different set of rules and requirements according to different states. Currently, only one state out of 14 has provisions for Muslims to convert. In other states' religious departments, apostasy is a crime punishable by fines and jail sentences and offenders are often sent to prison-like rehabilitation centres. "It is indeed a very disappointing ruling," said Ivy Josiah, head of the Woman's Aid Organisation, a local NGO fighting for rights of women. "The bottom line is, we have a woman who wants to be a wife, a mother, and now she does not have that right," Josiah told reporters. Joy, who was not present at Wednesday's hearing, was said to be in hiding with her Catholic fiance for protection. She has been unable to get married as her husband would have to embrace Islam as long as she was legally Muslim under the country's laws. Outside the courtroom in Malaysia's administrative capital of Putrajaya, more than 300 Muslims representing as many as 80 Islamic groups gathered to pray for the courts to deny Joy's appeal. Yusri Mohamad, president of the Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia, welcomed the decision, saying that the court proceedings had been "an attempt to deconstruct and revamp our current formula, a winning formula" for a peaceful multi-religous society. Lawyers for Joy have declined to say what her next move would be, but Wednesday's court remains the last legal avenue for her. "The outcome of this case has shown that we have a constitutional guarantee of freedom which cannot be enforced because our civil courts have no jurisdiction over religious matters," said Leonard Teoh, a lawyer representing the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism. "The only avenue now is for us to take a political approach. We will approach the political leaders," said Teoh. "People like Lina Joy should not be trapped in any religion." About 60 per cent of Malaysia's 26 million people are Malay Muslims, whose civil, family, marriage and personal rights are decided by Sharia courts. The minorities - the ethnic Chinese, Indians and other smaller communities - are governed by civil courts.

A U.S. military statement, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" on Thursday in Sadr City.(AP Photo/Karim Kadim) BAGHDAD - A suicide bomber hit a police recruiting center Thursday in Fallujah, killing as many as 25 people, police said. The U.S. military said only one policeman was killed and eight were wounded. U.S. forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al-Qaida gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. The American military also reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed Wednesday in a roadside bombing in Baghdad and one who died of wounds from a roadside bomb attack northwest of the capital Tuesday. At least 122 American forces have died in May, the third-deadliest month of the Iraq conflict. U.S. forces also continued a search for five Britons who were kidnapped Tuesday in Baghdad, as well as for two of its soldiers who have been missing since a May 12 ambush south of the capital. The Fallujah suicide bomber killed at least 10 policemen in the attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. The rest of the dead were civilians, many of them in line seeking jobs as policemen. He said as many as 50 were wounded. Fallujah General Hospital had received 15 bodies and 10 wounded, according to a doctor there, who would not allow the use of his name because he feared retribution. The physician said he believed other casualties were taken to the nearby Jordanian Hospital and private clinics. A member of the Fallujah city council, who also asked for anonymity for fear of attack by insurgents, said there were at least 20 killed and 25 injured. The coordination of information in Fallujah was particularly difficult because the mobile telephone system has been working only sporadically. Maj. Jeff Pool of the Multi-National Force-West said the Anbar province governor's office and the provincial police put the total number of dead at one Iraqi policeman, with six police and two civilians wounded in Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated explosives in his vest at the third of four checkpoints, standing among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only opened Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The U.S. military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaida. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of Sunni insurgents and al-Qaida throughout the war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents called for U.S. help. Members of al-Qaida, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final exams, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from al-Qaida. Clashes continued into the afternoon, and the council official said the al-Qaida leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the U.S. military. U.S. forces, meanwhile, pressed on with the search for five kidnapped Britons, and a procession of mourners, some of them women wailing and beating their chests, marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a U.S. helicopter strike before dawn. The U.S. military said it had no report of airstrikes in Sadr City and that there were no civilian casualties in the second day of a search for the Britons, who were abducted Tuesday from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad. A U.S. military statement, however, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. AP Television News videotape from Sadr City showed the coffins of the victims atop a small bus with men and women walking behind, crying. A young boy could be seen sitting next to the coffins. A car in the area was punctured with big holes, as if hit by an airstrike. A police officer in Sadr City, who refused to allow use of his name because he feared retribution, said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 a.m., killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home , a common practice in Iraq's extreme heat through late spring and summer. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was wounded. Also in Sadr City raids, which the U.S. has been conducting with a select unit of Iraqi army forces, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi claimed his home was raided and ransacked by American forces at 3 a.m. Thursday. The military said it had no report of the incident. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. Dozens of U.S. Humvees and Bradley fighting vehicles had taken up positions around Sadr City at nightfall Wednesday. The five kidnapped Britons included four bodyguards working for the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld and one employee of BearingPoint, a U.S.-based management consulting firm. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. The Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, claimed responsibility. Wiggins also said that more than 100 patrols a day were being launched to search for two missing troops who vanished after a May 12 ambush near Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. Four Americans and one Iraqi soldier were killed in the attack and the body of another American was later found in the Euphrates River. "Our determination and resolve to locate our missing soldiers is unwavering," Wiggins said.

Malaysia's highest civil court on Wednesday rejected Lina Joy's appeal to have the word "Islam" stricken from her national identity card. The verdict was seen as a blow to religious freedom in this ethnically diverse country made up of Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs. "I am disappointed that the Federal Court is not able to vindicate a simple but important fundamental right that exists in all persons: Namely, the right to believe in the religion of one's choice," Joy said in a statement released through her lawyer, Benjamin Dawson. "The Federal Court has not only denied me that right but (denied it) to all Malaysians who value fundamental freedoms," she said. About 60 percent of Malaysia's 26 million people are Malay Muslims, whose civil, family, marriage and personal rights are decided by Shariah courts. The minorities &mdash; the ethnic Chinese, Indians and other smaller communities &mdash; are governed by civil courts. But the constitution does not say who has the final say in cases such as Joy's when Islam confronts Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism or other religions. The founding fathers of Malaysia left the constitution deliberately vague, unwilling to upset any of the three ethnic groups dominant at the time of independence from Britain 50 years ago, when building a peaceful multiracial nation was more important. The situation was muddied further with the constitution describing Malaysia as a secular state but recognizing Islam as the official religion. In its verdict Wednesday, the Federal Court said Joy &mdash; who was born to Muslim parents and began attending church in 1990 &mdash; should seek permission to renounce Islam from Islamic Shariah courts. Joy, however, has refused to seek the Shariah court's permission, saying she is a Christian and should not be bound by Islamic laws. If she continues to practice Christianity, she faces being charged with apostasy, which is punishable by a jail sentence and fine. She also has the option to leave the country. Asked if she will take that option, Joy, 43, said in her statement: "It would be extremely difficult to exercise freedom of conscience in the present environment." Dawson, her lawyer, said the media are free to draw their conclusion from the statement. Joy, who was baptized in 1998, was successful in getting the National Registration Department to change her name to Lina Joy on her identity card. But the department refused to drop Muslim from the religion column of the card. A series of rejected appeals from 2000 onward brought her case to the Federal Court.

But there were no injuries. The rocket fire also triggered power outages in Sderot and damaged several apartments. Sderot residents whose apartments were hit escaped injury because they were either outside or in a reinforced room when the rockets landed. Islamic Jihad's military operatives and the Popular Resistance Committees took responsibility for the attacks. Before dawn yesterday, two Hamas men were killed in an Israel Air Force strike on their vehicle in the Jabalya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. It was part of an operation meant to curb the rocket fire. Mahmoud Hamud and Omar Rihan, both 23-year-old Jabalya residents, were apparently on their way to fire Qassam rockets on southern Israel. In addition, three Islamic Jihad militants were killed early yesterday in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, apparently due to the explosion of a bomb they were preparing. The number of rockets fired at southern Israel this week has significantly decreased from the dozens of Qassams fired daily since the escalation began. Hamas has limited its rocket attacks in the last few days. The change appears to be related to internal Palestinian talks, although it could also be a sign that Hamas is looking for a way out of the latest round of violence. Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh told reporters, after meeting with the Egyptian security delegation in Gaza, that his government supports a comprehensive cease-fire with Israel - meaning in the West Bank as well as Gaza. Haniyeh, who also met with Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, apparently decided to speak to the reporters in an effort to dismiss reports that he had gone underground for fear of being harmed in the violence. Also yesterday, Israel's political-security cabinet unanimously decided to carry on with the current level of the military operation in Gaza. This means the Israel Defense Forces will continue to deploy small forces in uninhabited areas in the northern Gaza Strip and send special units to populated areas, in limited numbers, while the air force continues operations there. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the heads of the Israel Defense Forces and the Shin Bet security service told the cabinet yesterday that the army's activities in Gaza have so far been "effective," leading to a drop in the number of Qassams being launched. Army gets green light A political source in Jerusalem said the army has already been authorized to expand its activities in Gaza. "Until now, only a small portion of the activities approved by the cabinet have been implemented," the source said, adding that many objectives have yet to be reached. Ministers Eli Yishai (Shas) and Avigdor Lieberman (Yisrael Beiteinu) suggested intensifying the military operation, with Yishai saying Israel should carpet-bomb Palestinian towns after calling on the residents to evacuate the area. Ministers Meir Sheetrit (Kadima) and Rafi Eitan (Pensioners) suggested that Israel produce an "Israeli Qassam" and fire it at Gaza in response to the rocket fire in Sderot. Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh (Labor) submitted to the cabinet a report on the Defense Ministry's efforts to assist Sderot residents, including the operation of a district council on sustaining the economy in emergency situations and the establishment of a "welfare war room" to assist the weak sectors of the Sderot population. Sneh also said additional funds are needed to reinforce buildings in the Negev town. From French fries to calamari rings to health food, the Taste of the City Festival has it all.

Putin slams Russian television for `cheap` foreign soap Moscow, May 31: Russian President Vladimir Putin Wednesday slammed Russian television for buying up cheap foreign soap operas. "For over 15 years our youngsters have lived under massive cultural pressure of surrogates from abroad," Putin said, charging television channels with "buying anything as long as it is cheap." "We must understand and accept the culture of other countries and learn to use their best examples. We have always done that and acted so," Putin said in televised comments. "We must first make it so our young generation grows in the beneficent atmosphere of our national culture, and promote good taste and high standards of behavior." Though foreign TV series make up only a small part of Russian television broadcasts, Russian channels often opt for outdated and second-rate films due to copyright prices. *Your friend's e-mail address: Would you believe Kevin Costner as serial killer?

In the inter-Korean ministerial talks that opened in Seoul on Tuesday, North Korean chief delegate Kwon Ho-ung called on Seoul to reconsider the postponement of rice aid to the North due to Pyongyang¡¯s failure to implement a February denuclearization agreement, according to Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Nam-shik. Unification Minister Lee Jae-joung in response ¡°explained the procedures¡± necessary for the shipment of rice, including government approval for spending from the Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund, Kim said. North Korean chief delegate Kwon Ho-ung, left, and Unification Minister Lee Jae-joung, right, talk before Wednesday's session of the 21st inter-Korean ministerial talks at the Grand Hilton Hotel in Seoul./Yonhap When it agreed in inter-Korean economic talks last month to send rice, South Korea attached a verbal condition that it can change the timing of the shipment if North Korea keeps delaying the shutdown of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon under the six-nation agreement. North Korea did not insist on the aid to the point of derailing the ongoing talks, the spokesman said. Initially, a bumpy road was expected for the ministerial talks, since the North boycotted a round of ministerial talks last July when the South postponed rice and fertilizer aid after Pyongyang test-fired missiles. In Wednesday¡¯s session, the North Korean chief delegate said the delay was not Pyongyang¡¯s fault but Washington¡¯s -- an apparent reference to hiccups in the transfer of unfrozen North Korean funds from a Macau bank. The North repeatedly called on Seoul to stop joint military exercises with the U.S. and abolish the National Security Law in these talks. For its part, the South proposed a joint conference between state-run think tanks from the two sides, bilateral defense ministers¡¯ talks, the gradual reopening of cross-border railways and the repatriation of South Korean prisoners of war and South Koreans abducted by the North. The North Koreans continued to stress ¡°nationhood¡± as they had on the first day of the ministerial meeting. Kwon said the two Koreas should tackle ¡°internal affairs¡± without the intervention of foreign forces, citing the Kaesong Industrial Complex and South Korean package tours to Mt. Kumkang as good examples of bilateral cooperation. The North Korean Workers¡¯ Party daily or Rodong Shinmun and the Chosun Shinbo, the mouthpiece of the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan or Chongryon, also emphasized the phrase ¡°between the two Koreas¡± in reports Wednesday. Unification Minister Lee asked for cooperation and hard work from the North. He recounted a fable told by China's first historian Sima Qian¡¯s Shiji about a man who concentrated so hard that he could penetrate a rock with an arrow. Kwon replied the two sides are even capable of ¡°penetrating iron with water drops¡± if they work together. The negotiations continue until Thursday night, with the results announced in a joint press release.

Putin slams Russian TV for shoddy foreign fare By Guy Faulconbridge, Reuters | MOSCOW -- President Vladimir Putin said yesterday that Russian television was polluting young people's minds with cheap imports and urged broadcasters to embrace wholesome home-grown entertainment instead. The criticism fits in with a drive by Putin, who has overseen a resurgence in Russia's confidence and power on the world stage, to promote patriotic values and Russian culture. Railing against the bosses of national television stations who were among the officials attending a Kremlin meeting on culture, Putin said: "They buy anything on the international market as long as it is cheap." "For more than 15 years our youth have been living under the mass cultural influence of ersatz foreign substitutes," RIA news agency quoted Putin as saying. "We must create the conditions so that the coming of age of the younger generation takes place in a wholesome atmosphere of home grown culture, so that young people are brought up with high artistic taste and standards of behavior ." Russian state or state-controlled television channels, which have the biggest audiences, carry a mixture of news, domestic crime serials, Soviet films, Hollywood blockbusters, and reality shows. Imported franchises on Russian television include "Who wants to be a Millionaire?", which originated in Britain, and the French-owned game show "Fort Boyard." Several soap operas are based on imported concepts adapted for the Russian audience. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Canadian Forces Brig.-Gen. Tim Grant, commander of Task Force Afghanistan, speaks to reporters from Kandahar on Thursday, May 31, 2007. Military confirms Canadian soldier died in crash Updated Thu. May. 31 2007 9:29 AM ET The military has released the name of a Canadian soldier killed in a helicopter crash Wednesday in Afghanistan that left a total of seven troops dead. Master Cpl. Darrell Jason Priede was a military imagery technician -- or combat cameraman -- from CFB Gagetown, said Brig.-Gen. Tim Grant during a news conference at Kandahar Airfield Thursday. "Our deepest sympathies go out to the family and friends of this wonderful young Canadian. In working to bring peace to this troubled country he has paid the ultimate price," Grant said. "However, we should all remember that Darrell was involved in a good thing, a good fight, and we should be proud of what he has done." Priede was a passenger in the U.S. CH-47 Chinook helicopter when it went down in Helmand province, one of the most volatile regions of the country. In addition to Priede, five American crew members of the helicopter were killed, along with a British military passenger. Troops have secured the wreckage of the helicopter and are investigating the cause of the crash. Purported Taliban spokesperson Qari Yousef Ahmadi said Taliban militants shot down the helicopter, but the claim has not been independently verified. Initial reports have suggested that the helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, a U.S. official told The Canadian Press. Maj. John Thomas, a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force on Thursday, said "there will be a full investigation." "We will try to determine everything that happened and to fully investigate the site." The helicopter went down at about 9 p.m. local time Wednesday, NATO officials said. A rescue team arriving at the scene was then ambushed by insurgents and had to call in air support to ward off the attackers. One Afghan civilian was injured by gunfire. Grant declined to comment on the operation Priede was involved in because the campaign is still underway. He said fighting in Helmand province has been heavy in recent weeks, and troops are working to clear out opposition fighters so that refurbishment of the Kajaki hydroelectric dam, a major development project in the area of the crash, can go ahead. "They are certainly showing now, particularly in the Helmand River valley, that they are trying to make a last stand in this area," Grant said. "At the end of the day, though, they are not being successful. They are being pushed back, they are being defeated by the ISAF forces on the ground." In recent months, violence has centred around the Kajaki Dam area, with U.S. and British forces fighting insurgents targeting the project. CTV's Steve Chao, reporting from Kandahar, said the dam project is a centrepiece in redevelopment efforts in the country. "This is one major project that NATO is hoping will win the hearts and minds down here by providing some stable electricity," Chao told CTV Newsnet. The Chinook has two rotors and is mainly used for transport. It can fit about 40 soldiers in addition to a small crew. Eight U.S. personnel died last February when their Chinook crashed in the southern province of Zabul, but the incident was not the result of a militant attack. Another 10 U.S. soldiers died in a Chinook crash in May 2006, after an attempted nighttime landing. But a 2005 U.S. helicopter crash, which killed 16 Americans, is believed to have been caused by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by militants. In total, 56 Canadian military personnel have now been killed in Afghanistan.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/3-0&fd=R&url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21829502-2703,00.html&cid=1116817584&ei=m-xeRsngAYf40QHv7IzQDQ US bid to rescue British hostages | The World | The Australian The Australian &mdash; The World US bid to rescue British hostages US forces raided Shia militia strongholds in eastern Baghdad yesterday after mounting evidence emerged that an Iranian-backed group was behind the abduction of five Britons. According to Iraqi and British officials working on the case, the kidnapping of a British IT expert and four private security guards bore all the hallmarks of the Mahdi Army, the militant group headed by Moqtada al-Sadr. The Shia religious leader returned to Iraq last week and there have been fears he would order a new wave of attacks against US and British targets. The US military announced yesterday that two more American soldiers had been killed in Iraq, confirming that May had become the deadliest month for American forces since 2004. The soldiers were killed late on Wednesday when a roadside bomb hit their foot patrol and brought US casualties for the month to 116 - the most since November 2004, when marines fought a fierce battle to retake the city of Fallujah. April was bloody for the US-led coalition, with 104 deaths. Taken together, the two past months have been the deadliest since the war began. Also yesterday, a suicide bomber hit a police recruiting centre in Fallujah, killing up to 25 people and wounding 50, police said. In another blow, a Sunni police chief praised by US forces for clearing his city of insurgents was arrested following an investigation into alleged murder, corruption and crimes against the Iraqi people. Colonel Hamid Ibrahim al-Jazaa, his brother and 14 bodyguards were taken into custody Tuesday in the city of Hit, 140km west of Baghdad, according to a statement by the public affairs office of Multinational Corps-Iraq. The statement gave no details of the allegations. As the hunt for the five Britons continued, it has been revealed British SAS troopers hunting for al-Qa'ida in Iraq are being diverted to lead the search for the men. The SAS and the Special Boat Service, the Royal Marine equivalent of the army's elite regiment, have squadrons in Baghdad, although their main task has been to work alongside American special forces. The SAS and SBS have been engaged in covert missions against al-Qa'ida for four years, giving them experience of operating in the most hostile and complex environment. Military sources said the search would need to be done with the greatest sensitivity. The "kinetic option" used against al-Qa'ida targets - tracking and eliminating - was not going to be the best solution. US commanders have backed away from taking on Mahdi Army gunmen because of the Iraqi Government's desire to keep al-Sadr, the Islamic cleric who controls the militia force, in the political process. If his men have taken the Britons, the focus will be on negotiating the safe release of the hostages, not going in with guns blazing. The Britons - a consultant and his four armed bodyguards - were snatched late on Tuesday by a large group of gunmen in Iraqi police uniforms. In an interview with BBC radio, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari noted the raid had taken place near Sadr City, an al-Sadr stronghold. He said it was too soon to blame a specific group, but said the nature of the kidnapping clearly pointed to the involvement of one of the Shia militant groups. Meanwhile, an Iraqi court yesterday sentenced a former minister in absentia to seven years in prison for spiriting more than $US1 billion ($1.25 billion) out of the country during his brief tenure. Hazem al-Shaalan was accused along with scores of other officials of embezzling money earmarked for weapons. He denied the charges, which were first raised in 2005.

Master Cpl. Darrell Jason Priede was the 56th Canadian service member killed since 2002 in Afghanistan, his death coming less than a week after another corporal lost his life to a roadside bomb. As a surface patrol headed in to the crash site, the troops themselves were ambushed by insurgents, according to NATO. Email to a friend Under continuing fire, the patrol eventually called for an air strike to "eliminate the enemy threat," said a news release from ISAF, NATO's Afghanistan mission. All five crew members of the Chinook heavy lift helicopter and two military passengers were killed in the incident, said the release. An Afghan civilian was injured in the shooting after the helicopter went down. Priede was a combat cameraman taking part in an operation around the Kajaki damn, the scene of fierce fighting recently between mainly British soldiers and the Taliban. The U.S.-funded dam is being repaired so it can supply electricity to Kandahar and the British have fought hard to protect it from insurgent attack. The corporal's job involved recording operations so there is an accurate record of what took place. "In working to bring peace to this troubled country, he has ended up paying the ultimate sacrifice," said Brig.-Gen. Tim Grant, head of Canada's Afghanistan task force. "There is no way to comfort those who grieve at this terrible time. However, we should all remember that Darrell was involved in a good thing, a good fight and we should be proud of what he has done." Qari Yousef Ahmadi, a self-described Taliban spokesman, said in an interview the insurgents had used "new weapons" against the aircraft and they had worked successfully. "We're very happy," said Ahmadi, whose claims could not be proven independently. ISAF said only that it was investigating the cause of the downing. Amanullah, a farmer in Khanano Kaly in Helmand province, who goes by only one name, said he saw the helicopter hit the ground and that Taliban had been shooting in the area. He could not tell, however, whether the craft was actually brought down by the insurgents. Amanullah, 40, described seeing the aircraft in flames on the ground near his home. Early last Friday, Cpl. Matthew McCully, 23, died after triggering an improvised explosive device reportedly planted by the Taliban. He was part of a unit that trains and mentors the Afghan national army and was accompanying ANA troops as they led an operation against the insurgency in Kandahar province's Zhari district.

Here are excerpts of his statement. ON THE BRITISH SECRET SERVICES' ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE POISONING "It's hard to get rid of the thought that Litvinenko was an agent who got out of the secret service's control and was eliminated. Even if it was not done by the secret service itself, it was done under its control or connivance." Asked if there was evidence of their direct participation, Lugovoi said: "There is." ON ALLEGEDLY BEING RECRUITED AS A BRITISH SPY Mr Lugovoi said in 2005 Mr Litvinenko invited him to London where he proposed the idea of starting a joint business. Mr Lugovoi went on to say that he was paid too much money for giving minor consultations to British business partners. "It became clear that the fee was aimed at gradually engaging me in co-operation. The talks were becoming more open. The British started to show interest in everything: my connections, financial opportunities, if I had direct access to the Russian president's administration, as well as contacts with officers of the Federal Security Service, the Federal Bodyguard Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service. They were especially interested in an opportunity to get information about the FSB activities in the so-called English direction. "They openly begun to recruit me as a British intelligence agent. The British, in essence, suggested that I gather any discrediting information about President Vladimir Putin and members of his family. For example, it was proposed that I gather information about a state official, through whom they intended to get discrediting information about the president. In particular, they intended to lure this state official to London in order to get discrediting information about the president in exchange for silence about his personal bank accounts. I will tell investigators of the prosecutor-general's office who I'm talking about. "For maintaining an undercover connection, I was given a British mobile phone, which I was supposed to use for calling from Moscow to London. From bad to worse: Litvinenko gave me an edition of Yevgeny Grishkovets' book Rubashka and told me that now we have to use cipher like in spy movies and to encode a text using numbers of pages, paragraphs and lines. "One has to be a complete idiot not to understand that under the pretext of developing a joint business, a banal recruiting was going on with concrete political and intelligence goals with regard to Russia and its president. "I do not regard myself a passionate supporter of President Putin and I have my personal reasons for that, which many can guess about. But I was taught to defend the motherland, not to betray it. During another meeting with Litvinenko, I told him straight everything I thought about that and said that I was not interested in such business." ON ALLEGEDLY BEING MADE A SCAPEGOAT Mr Lugovoi said the British had already made up their minds that he was guilty of killing Mr Litvinenko. "For a long time I was constrained by my obligations to the Crown Prosecution Service. I was willingly co-operating with the crown prosecutor's office and I was answering every question. I was also answering all the questions that the Scotland Yard investigators were asking me. Even then I had a feeling that all the questions were just a formality and the accused were already determined, that is myself and Dmitry Kovtun. But I tried to keep all the obligations... and I was made a scapegoat." He said the British had hoped he would stay silent, but that he was not going to allow them to push their agenda. "Just think of it: they have found a Russian James Bond, who enters into nuclear centres and in cold blood poisons a friend of his and, at the same time, poisons himself, his friends, children and wife. And all that was done single-handedly by the terrorist Lugovoi. Who - as a result - loses his business and clients. And the main question: what for? Where is the motive for my crime? "London was hoping that I would keep silent as I have not been extradited... and that all the questions would resolve themselves: I would be branded as a criminal; Berezovsky would get a very good reason not to be extradited to Russia; Scotland Yard and the British special services would save face in the eyes of their taxpayers; while Russia and its leadership would be discredited for a long time. "Only none of this will happen. I am prepared to lose even more money, but I will fight for my honest name. I understand that if I went to London, I - for the sake of preserving somebody's professional honour - would be convicted, no matter what. That is why in the very near future, as we have done before, I will hire serious lawyers in London in order to defend my honest name in the British law-enforcement agencies. "If the British authorities refuse to conduct a fair trial, I will be prepared to appeal to the international court in The Hague." ON WHY HE BELIEVES THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM ARE WRONG "Now I would like to return to the issue of [Litvinenko's] death. First, I don't think you have to be a lawyer to understand that a motive is needed to carry out a crime like this. Sasha [Litvinenko] was not my enemy. I did not have any opinion on what he was doing in London, which books he was writing and who he was criticising. I have been a businessman for a long time now, and this didn't really interest me. "Second, for some reason all British newspapers are saying that the poisoning took place on 1 November, but Litvinenko and I met twice in October. Moreover, we met in his home in summer, when his wife Marina was away. By the way, Berezovsky didn't know of that meeting. It was almost the ideal place for a poisoning. However, when conditions were ideal, it didn't happen. But in a bar with a lot of people, when he could have failed to turn up, in the presence of dozens of witnesses, it happened. This means that someone wanted us to be seen together in the Millennium Bar. "Third, those who know Sasha can confirm that he never drank or smoked. Neither I nor Dima [Dmitry Kovtun] can remember whether he ordered anything, tea or water, because we were preparing to go to a football game at the time and, since it was cold, had drunk a good amount of spirits. What kind of idiot poisoner would it take to act in such a primitive way? Again, somebody wanted to set us up. "Fourth, if the poisoning took place on 1 November, then how did the polonium leave traces [changes track], I underline, it only left traces in places in London where I and Litvinenko met in October. And why was the polonium found in aircraft on which Dima and I returned to Moscow and Germany respectively in October 2006? My only conclusion is that we were purposely marked with polonium in order to use us in a political scandal later. "[Fifth,] I came to London with my wife and children to go to a football game. As a consequence, all of them were checked for polonium poisoning and the results were not comforting. They were tested together with me in the hospital. What kind of monster would you have to be to expose the lives of your children and your wife to such threats? "Sixth, already in summer 2006 Litvinenko started giving me various little gifts. When I was tested in the hospital, all my things were checked. It turned out that souvenirs and a number of documents which Litvinenko had given me long before 1 November were splattered with polonium. I told our investigators in the Prosecutor-General's Office about this, but they said that their British colleagues weren't interested for some reason. It is possible that Litvinenko himself left the traces (of polonium), but this theory was unacceptable to the British justice from the very beginning. "Seventh, it is no longer a secret that all my meetings with Litvinenko were thoroughly followed by the UK secret services. Why didn't they follow up Litvinenko's poisoning and allow all of us to leave Britain without punishment? Why has the address where we met British agents, [names omitted], not been included among the dozens of places in London mentioned in the media where polonium has been found? I would like to know whether polonium traces was found in that office, which is in essence one of their secret meeting places."

Japan catches nearly 1,000 whales there each year in the name of research. After an acrimonious debate, a large number of countries refused to vote, saying the resolution was illegitimate. There was, however, consensus support for a motion censuring environmental groups which try to hinder Japan's Antarctic programme. Both Greenpeace and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society have tried to block the programme in recent years, culminating in a damaging collision between Japanese and Sea Shepherd vessels in the recent Antarctic season for which each party blames the other. It was just about the only sign of common ground in a day marked by the entrenched positions and political posturing which has bedevilled this organisation for years. 'Stain on the commission' Any International Whaling Commission (IWC) member is entitled to hunt whales for scientific research, but anti-whaling countries view the size and scope of Japan's programmes in the Antarctic and north Pacific as going far beyond what was envisaged when the IWC's constitution, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, was drawn up in 1946. Resolutions calling for a halt have materialised regularly. Japan is not obliged to comply with the IWC vote "Every scientific catch is a stain on the record of this commission," said Monaco's whaling commissioner Frederic Briand. "The best thing Japan could do is to reduce the size of its scientific whaling programmes around the world." The IWC's scientific committee recently reviewed Japan's Antarctic programme, and New Zealand's conservation minister Chris Carter was not too impressed with their conclusions. Japanese hunters "killed 7,000 whales over 18 years, and couldn't even decide how many whales there are," he fumed. This was in marked contrast to the St Kitts commissioner Cedric Liburd, who said: "This research provided significant data enabling us to understand the structure and abundance of whale populations. Every scientific catch is a stain on the record of this commission "I find [this resolution] extremely disturbing, vexatious and in some ways irrelevant," he said. "It is frivolous, devoid of action and meaningless." Virtually all of the pro-whaling bloc abstained from the vote, leading to a majority of 40 to 2. It makes no material difference, as Japan is not obliged to comply. Nevertheless, it is viewed by environmental groups as an important weapon in the battle for hearts and minds. Environmental organisations Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd came under fire themselves in a resolution co-ordinated by Japan and New Zealand. It was the only concrete sign so far of the common ground which both sides said they were seeking before the meeting convened. People on both sides of the debate talk about their views The resolution, which says that member governments "do not condone, and in fact condemn, any actions that are a risk to human life and property in relation to the activities of vessels at sea," passed by consensus. "We maintain that our protests are peaceful and non-violent," commented Shane Rattenbury of Greenpeace International. "Greenpeace has 35 years of history of being non-violent; but I'm sure the Japanese government will attempt to wave it in our face and say 'you shouldn't be undertaking these protests'." Sea Shepherd's record is rather different, having been implicated in attacks on whaling vessels spanning more than two decades. It is notable that while Greenpeace is allowed into the meeting here, Sea Shepherd is not. Parts of the resolution can also be interpreted as a rebuke to Japan, particularly an injunction to "have regard to protecting... the fragile Antarctic environment." The meeting looked like running late into its penultimate evening, with several major issues unresolved.

On May 30, a three-judge panel issued a split decision rejecting Lina Joy's appeal to have the word "Islam" removed from her government-issued Malaysian identity card. The ruling directed her to approach the Shariah Court should she wish to renounce her faith. Rev. Hermen Shastri, general secretary of the Council of Churches of Malaysia, was one of several Christian leaders who spoke with UCA News after the decision was announced. If the plaintiff "still seeks to be a Christian, she will find it difficult to live in Malaysia," he said. "Lina Joy and all other former Muslims who have chosen to convert out of Islam will find no redress in the country's civil courts." Catholic Bishop Paul Tan Chee Ing of Melaka-Johor, chairman of the Christian Federation of Malaysia (CFM), said in a press statement issued the same day that the federation is "disturbed and saddened by the decision of the Federal Court." The Jesuit bishop noted that the court upheld the National Registration Department's "right to insist on a certificate from the Shariah Court that she has apostatized, prior to registering her conversion in the identity card." He added that such an insistence "has curtailed the fundamental right of an individual to profess and express his or her religion as provided for in Article 11" of the constitution. According to Bishop Tan, the CFM has "noted with much concern that this decision reflects a growing trend of decisions in the courts where civil courts are abdicating their responsibility of providing legal redress to individuals who only seek to profess and live their religion according to their conscience." The prelate added that "it is now more pressing for the government and lawmakers to revisit the relevant legislation and to reinstate the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts so that equal protection of the right to choose and express one's religion is accorded to all Malaysians." Leonard Teoh, a Catholic lawyer who attended the court proceedings on behalf of the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism, told reporters: "In the interest of racial and religious harmony, something needs to be done. People like Lina Joy should not be trapped in a legal cage, not being able to come out to practice their true conscience and religion." Joy, 42, was born Azlina Jailani. Years ago she dated a Catholic man, and eventually decided to become a Catholic herself. She started going to church in 1990, at the age of 26, and was baptized a Catholic in a church in Kuala Lumpur in 1998. She then decided to change her name to Lina Joy. In 1999, the National Registration Department, which is in charge of issuing the compulsory Malaysian identity cards, accepted the change of name but refused to remove the word "Islam" from her card, saying it could not do so without a Shariah Court order certifying she had renounced Islam. Joy then took the matter to the civil court, citing Article 11 of the constitution. Malaysia is governed by civil laws but a separate system based on Islamic law – Shariah or Shari'a – governs some aspects of Muslims' life. Renouncing Islam is illegal under this system, punishable by imprisonment or a fine. Apostates are also sent to rehabilitation centers. Muslims comprise about 60 percent of Malaysia's 26 million people. In the verdict he wrote for the Lina Joy case, Chief Justice Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim said: "Apostasy is within the jurisdiction of the Islamic law and the Shariah court. The civil court cannot interfere." The dissenting opinion came from a Christian judge, Richard Malanjum, who termed it unreasonable to force Joy to go to the Shariah Court, knowing that apostasy is a criminal offense under the Shariah law and she would be punished. Since conversion is a "fundamental right," Malanjum said, "the civil court should not decline jurisdiction." The verdict represents Joy's last legal recourse in civil court. Legally she cannot marry her Catholic partner without him converting to Islam. "Yes, Lina Joy has lost, but she has not lost her faith. She has only lost the appeal," Rev. Shastri said. According to a 2006 BBC News report, other Muslims in Malaysia have converted to other religions but keep their conversion a secret.

Speaking to reporters in Vienna Thursday - on the sidelines of a women's empowerment conference, Rice said the international community wants Iran to demonstrate that it is not seeking a nuclear weapon. Despite limited U.N. sanctions and a possibility of a tougher penalties, Tehran has continued to ignore U.N. demands to stop its uranium enrichment -- a process that can be used to make nuclear weapons. Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani and European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana are to meet in Madrid Thursday for another round of talks to try to resolve issue. Larijani says suspension of enrichment activity is not a way to resolve the dispute. On Wednesday, foreign ministers from the Group of Eight industrialized nations: Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States, renewed calls for Iran to stop uranium enrichment or face "appropriate measures." The United States and its allies accuse Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons. Tehran says its program is for peaceful, civilian use. Some information for this report was provided by AFP, AP and Reuters.

Links from the paper Letter to the Editor Sell your car for free in print and online Place a classified newspaper ad Suicide bomber kills 20 By Fadhil al-Badrani in Falluja, Iraq May 31, 2007 09:07pm A SUICIDE bomber killed at least 20 people and wounded another 20 in the Iraqi city of Falluja today, police and hospital officials said. Falluja police spokesman Hamid Abid said the bomber, wearing a suicide explosives vest, walked up to a queue of about 150 young men at a police recruitment centre and blew himself up. Mr Abid put the total number of killed and wounded at between 45 and 50. Bilal Mohammed, a doctor at Falluja hospital, said 20 had been killed and 20 wounded. Falluja, 50km west of Baghdad, is in restive Anbar province, a stronghold of Sunni Arab insurgency. Recruitment centres for Iraqi security forces are common targets for such attacks, which are mostly blamed on Sunni Islamist al Qaeda. Some Sunni Arab tribes in Anbar have been encouraging young men to join the Iraqi security forces in Anbar as part of a new strategy to combat al Qaeda in the area. Al-Qaeda in turn has been waging a campaign against tribes who co-operate with authorities in Anbar. The US military has more than 6000 troops in Anbar, where local commanders have said that al Qaeda accounts for about 75 per cent of militants in and around Falluja.

BAGHDAD &#8211; Hundreds of Iraqi and U.S. troops cordoned off sections of Baghdad's Sadr City slum Wednesday and conducted a series of raids after five British citizens were abducted from a nearby government building, police and residents said. British Embassy officials held ongoing talks Wednesday with Iraqi officials to discuss the situation, Britain's Foreign Office said. Britain's COBRA crisis committee was also to meet for the second day. The five men were pulled out of a Finance Ministry office by about 40 heavily armed men in police uniforms in broad daylight Tuesday and driven in a convoy of 19 four-wheel-drive vehicles toward Sadr City, according to Iraqi officials in the Interior and Finance ministries. A senior Iraqi official said the radical Shiite Mahdi Army militia was suspected in the attack. British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said officials were doing all they could to secure the &#8220;swift and safe return&#8221; of the five. &#8220;This is clearly a very distressing time for all concerned,&#8221; she said, arriving at a Group of Eight meeting in Potsdam, Germany. Foreign Office officials are &#8220;offering help and assistance to the next of kin&#8221; of the Britons, Beckett said. &#8220;It is not helpful at this stage to speculate on what might have happened,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are working closely with the Iraqi authorities to establish the facts and doing all we can to secure their swift and safe return.&#8221; Soon after the abduction, Iraqi forces established a special battalion of Iraqi soldiers and police to search for the men, said Brig. Gen. Qassim al Musawi, an Iraqi army spokesman. &#8220;We are conducting search operations near the site where the abduction took place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Maybe today or in the coming few days, we will find them with the help of secret intelligence.&#8221; Residents of Sadr City said hundreds of U.S. and Iraqi troops sealed off areas of the Shiite neighborhood overnight and carried out a series of arrest raids that lasted until dawn. The residents spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals for speaking to the Western media. The U.S. military said it had arrested five suspected militants and one suspected leader of a militant cell during early morning raids in Sadr City. Those arrested were believed to be part of a cell that smuggled weapons in from Iran and sent militants to Iran for training, the statement said. The statement did not link the raid to the missing men. Two civilians were killed and four others injured in crossfire from gunbattles that broke out in one of the raids, police said. The civilians had been sleeping on their roofs in a traditional Iraqi custom to escape the brutal heat, police said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The U.S. military, responding to a query from The Associated Press, said in an e-mail that it had conducted two raids in Sadr City but that no shots were fired. A roadside bomb that apparently targeted a passing police patrol in Sadr City, missed and killed one civilian and wounded four others, police said. In other violence, several mortar rounds apparently targeting an American military base in the restive city of Fallujah missed their mark and landed instead on a courthouse and in a residential neighborhood, killing nine civilians and wounding 15 others, according to police and Dr. Anas al-Rawi, of Fallujah General Hospital. A police commander's convoy was struck by a roadside bomb in the town of Hamzah, south of Baghdad, killing two guards and injuring two others, a police officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he feared reprisals for talking to the media. Gunmen in three cars ambushed three soldiers who had stopped to drink orange juice in the center of Karbala, 50 miles south of Baghdad, and stole the nearly $396,000 in salaries they were transporting to their unit, an army official said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. The three soldiers were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the theft, the official said. The U.S. military said 10 American soldiers were killed in roadside bombings and a helicopter crash Monday, making May &#8211; with at least 113 fatalities so far &#8211; the third deadliest month of the war for U.S. troops. The Islamic state of Iraq, an al-Qaeda front group, claimed responsibility for shooting down the helicopter in a statement posted on a militant Web site. The claim could not be independently verified. The military did not say if the helicopter was shot down or had mechanical problems. Attacks on Iraqis raged on as well. Police and morgue officials contacted by the AP reported at least 120 people killed or found dead. All of the officials refused to allow use of their names fearing they could be targeted by militants. Police said two car bombers hit neighborhoods on opposite sides of the Tigris River on Tuesday, killing 40 people and wounding more than 100 others. A Shiite mosque was destroyed in the second of the two attacks, in the Amil neighborhood in west Baghdad. Hours after the British were abducted, Joe Gavaghan, a spokesman for Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld, confirmed that four of its security workers and one client were kidnapped. All four GardaWorld workers are British citizens, he said, declining to provide more details. A spokesman for BearingPoint, a McLean, Va.-based management consulting firm, said one of the company's employees, apparently the client referred to by Gavaghan, was among those abducted. If the kidnappings are the work of the Mahdi Army, as asserted by several Iraqi officials, they could be retaliation for the killing by British forces last week of the militia's commander in Basra. Canon Andrew White, the Anglican vicar of Baghdad, who lives in the Garda World compound and is involved in efforts to free the men, said it's &#8220;a strong possibility&#8221; the kidnapping was a retaliation for the killing. &#8220;We have been in contact with (the Mahdi Army) and are doing our best to try and continue that contact throughout the day,&#8221; he told BBC radio. The raid was reminiscent of an attack by the Shiite militiamen, dressed as Interior Ministry commandos, who stormed a Higher Education Ministry office Nov. 14 and seized as many as 200 people. Dozens of those kidnap victims have never been found. Maj. Gen. Abdul-Karim Khalaf, the Interior Ministry spokesman, said the abduction Tuesday was carried out by men wearing police uniforms who showed up at the Finance Ministry data collection facility in 19 four-wheel drive vehicles of the type used by police. He said the band of kidnappers sped off across the Army Canal to the east. Sadr City, the Shiite Mahdi Army stronghold, is directly east of the Canal. &#8220;We are pursuing this case very vigorously, first to release them, secondly to establish the truth of what happened, who was responsible,&#8221; Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told BBC radio on Wednesday. Zebari said that the government has long believed that its security forces were infiltrated by militia members. &#8220;The number of people who were involved in the operation &#8211; to seal off the building, to set roadblocks, to get into the building with such confidence &#8211; (means they) must have some connection,&#8221; he said. Associated Press reporter Qassim Abdul-Zahra contributed reporting from Baghdad and AP reporter David Stringer contributed reporting from London.

Ono was part of a canine-chewing stunt at a London radio station yesterday, reports Reuters, in which gonzo artist Mark McGowan ate cooked pieces of a Corgi, Queen Elizabeth II's dog of choice. McGowan staged the Fido-feeding (pictured above left) to protest the Queen's husband's treatment of a fox on a hunt last year. While the artist did his best to swallow a few chunks of Corgi (which had been minced with apple, onion and other seasonings), Yoko could only manage a small taste before looking "a bit strange," according to McGowan. Performance artist McGowan is a rabid vegetarian and animal-rights activist who once notoriously ate a swan to protest the monarchy. He says that the Corgi had died at a breeding farm.

What a bigot!!!!!!! Even if you are a vegitarian, you find a different way to protest that doesn't include eating meat. Yoko Ono is a useless piece of trash that only became famous because some beatle was stupid enough to marry her. That is the only reason she got her recording contract, cause she has proven over and over again that she has no singing talent whatsoever. Maybe her and K-fed can do an album together. Wouldn't that be a joke. A cruel one, mind you. LOSERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! on May 30th 2007 by Gary 12. Animal rights activists are LOSERS!!!! When are they going to get into their stupid skulls that human beings are NOT animals, we are ABOVE the animals. That's what happens when you make up your own stupid rules and regulations. That's all I have to say because I am now going to eat my delicious lunch: broiled STEAK, boiled LOBSTER, a very large glass of MILK, and a great big piece of KFC CHICKEN!!!!! on May 30th 2007 by my opinion 13.

The more attention people get, the more they replicate their bad behavior so............................. on May 30th 2007 by Tired of it all 14. I must say, while i find the whole thing UTTERLY DISGUSTING myself, I also find eating pork, and 80% of the meat that we eat to be pretty gross. Why are dog lovers up in arms that he pulled the stunt. The point of it was to show that one living thing's life isn't MORE valuable than another. So how would the queen feel if someone did something vile to an animal that SHE liked as opposed to a fox which she apparently doesn't care about. How do you decide what is acceptable and what isn't? on May 30th 2007 by Julian 15. Gorgi is always better broiled with a dash of Basil.

(AFP) LONDON • A British artist has eaten chunks of a Corgi dog, the breed favoured by the Queen, live on radio to protest against the royal family’s treatment of animals. Mark McGowan, 37, said he ate “about three bites” of the dog meat, cooked with apples, onions and seasoning, to highlight what he called Prince Philip’s mistreatment of a fox during a hunt by the Queen’s husband in January. “It was pretty disgusting,” McGowan said of the meal, which he ate while appearing on a London radio station on Tuesday. Yoko Ono, another guest on the show, also tried the meat. “I’ve never tasted anything like it – it was grey and had a very funny smell. It was horrible,” McGowan said. McGowan said he was angry that the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, of which the royal family is a patron, had not prosecuted Prince Philip for hunting and killing the fox. The RSPCA said the fox did not suffer. Corgis are the favoured dogs of the Queen, who has owned more than 30 of them during her reign. The dog died of natural causes at a Corgi breeders and was prepared and cooked by others for McGowan. McGowan is well known for his outlandish performance stunts. He ate a swan in another protest against the Queen. Swans are protected by the monarchy.

Security has been tightened in Bangkok amid fears that supporters of ousted Premier Thaksin Shinawatra may react violently ahead of a tribunal ruling that may disband the country's two largest parties. The constitutional court is due to rule on Wednesday, May 30, 2007 whether the Thai Rak Thai Party of former Prime Minister Thaksin, and its Democrat Party rival, violated election laws in April last year. If found guilty, either or both parties could be dissolved, or their executives barred from public office for five years, or both. (AP Photo/Apichart Weerawong) BANGKOK, Thailand - A court ruled Wednesday that the country's oldest political party was not guilty of maligning ousted Premier Thaksin Shinawatra and urging voters to cast a "no" vote in last year's election. The ruling was the first of six charges the Constitutional Tribunal is considering against the Democrat Party. It then will consider similar election law violations against Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party. A guilty finding could result in either the parties or their executives being banned from politics. The party is "not guilty of maligning Thaksin's party Thak Rak Thai and persuading people to vote no," a judge read out to the crowded courtroom. "It did not mislead voters about Thaksin's popularity as the election commission alleged."

May 31, 2007 12:00am A PERFORMANCE artist ate what he claimed was a corgi live on radio yesterday, in protest at the royal family and its alleged treatment of animals. Mark McGowan, who once ate a swan in a performance art show, said the cooked canine -- the Queen's favourite breed of dog - tasted "really, really, really disgusting". The artist said Yoko Ono, who featured on the same radio program, "looked a bit strange" as she also tasted the dog. Ms Ono did not offer a comment yesterday. The corgi, which died at a breeding farm, was minced with apple, onion and seasoning for the vegetarian and animal rights activist's consumption on London-based arts station 104.4 FM. "I know some people will find this offensive and tasteless, but I am doing this to raise awareness about the RSPCA's inability to prosecute Prince Philip and his friends shooting a fox earlier this year, letting it struggle for life for five minutes and then beating it to death with a stick," he said. As McGowan, 37, ate the dog, he said: "It's disgusting. It's really, really, really disgusting." He added: "It's all wrong - it's really, really wrong. The protest, what Prince Philip's done - it's all wrong." The show's presenter, Bob Smith, said: "I'm not convinced it's corgi." But McGowan insisted he trusted the two women who cooked the dog. He said: "It's stinky, it's white-looking, it's not like any meat I've ever seen." The RSPCA said in a statement it had investigated the alleged incident involving Prince Philip, and found no evidence of any unnecessary suffering for the fox. The fox died of gunshot wounds, with "no evidence of other injury or trauma", it said. Poorva Joshipura, director of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said foxes were no less capable of feeling pain than corgis.

The South, which is holding a four-day reconciliation meeting with its communist neighbour this week, says it will not start shipments until the nuclear-armed North begins shutting down its reactor. More than six weeks have passed since the April 14 deadline for the North to close the Yongbyon reactor, the first step in a six-nation nuclear disarmament agreement reached in February. A banking dispute with the US which is blocking the deal remains unresolved. “Your side knows well why the implementation of the February 13 agreement is being delayed. The US is responsible for the delay, not our side,” the North’s chief delegate Kwon Ho-Ung told the South’s team yesterday morning. His comments at the closed-door meeting were quoted by South Korean delegate Ko Gyoung-Bin, who briefed the media. Ko said the North did not raise the rice issue during the morning session. But at a subsequent meeting it urged the South to “keep the promise regarding the rice shipment”, according to a unification ministry spokesman quoted by Yonhap news agency. “Because of the intervention of foreign powers, the implementation of what is agreed upon between the two Koreas is being suspended, and the inter-Korean relationship is being edged out by foreign powers,” the North’s Korean Central News Agency quoted Kwon as saying in Seoul. The North — which staged a short-range missile test last week — also took the South to task for its joint military exercises with the US, and urged it to repeal its tough National Security Law and reject outside interference. The South pressed for the gradual opening of cross-border railway services following a historic May 17 test run, and greater economic cooperation. To ease military tensions it proposed the resumption of talks between defence ministers, after the first and only meeting almost seven years ago. It called for practical steps to solve a dispute over prisoners of war and abductees, but the North reportedly made no specific response. The South says the North has abducted 485 of its people since the end of their 1950-1953 war and failed to send home 548 POWs. The North says no South Koreans are held against their will. Relations worsened last year with the North’s missile launches and nuclear test but improved after the February nuclear deal. At the last ministerial round in March, the South agreed in principle to resume annual rice and fertiliser aid which the North badly needs. UN agencies say it faces a shortfall of 1mn tons of food this year, 20% of its needs. But the South delayed the first shipment of rice, out of an annual total of 400,000 tons, until there is progress on the nuclear pact. The North refuses to move until it receives $25mn which had been frozen in a Macau bank under US-inspired sanctions. The US said the accounts were unfrozen in March but the North has had problems finding a foreign bank to handle the transfer. Seoul plans joint efforts with China, Japan and Russia to persuade its neighbour to make a start on nuclear disarmament. All are members of the six-nation negotiating process, along with the US and North Korea itself. The South Korean, Japanese and Chinese foreign ministers, at talks on the southern island of Jeju on Sunday, are expected to discuss the issue. And Seoul’s Foreign Minister Song Min-Soon will hold similar talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue forum, the foreign ministry said.–AFP N Koreans blame US for delay in nuke pact Published: Thursday, 31 May, 2007, 01:40 AM Doha Time North Korea’s delegation head and Senior Cabinet Councillor Kwon Ho Ung (right) talks with South Korea’s Unification Minister Lee Jae-joung during their visit to Haengjusanseong, an ancient mountainside fortress, west of Seoul, yesterday North Korea yesterday urged South Korea to start delivering its promised rice aid, and blamed the United States for the delay in carrying out a nuclear disarmament pact.

Place a classified newspaper ad Man eats corgi in royal protest May 30, 2007 12:00 Article from: The Associated Press A PERFORMANCE artist ate what he claimed to be a corgi live on radio tonight, in protest at the Royal Family and its alleged treatment of animals. Mark McGowan, who once ate a swan in a performance art show, said the cooked canine - the Queen's favourite breed of dog - tasted "really, really, really disgusting". According to the artist, Yoko Ono, who featured on the same radio program, "looked a bit strange" as she also tasted the dog. The corgi, which died at a breeding farm, was minced with apple, onion and seasoning for the artist's consumption on the Bob and Roberta Smith radio program, broadcast on London-based arts station 104.4 Resonance FM. Before the show, the vegetarian and animal rights activist explained his motives for the protest. "I know some people will find this offensive and tasteless but I am doing this to raise awareness about the RSPCA's inability to prosecute Prince Philip and his friends shooting a fox earlier this year, letting it struggle for life for five minutes and then beating it to death with a stick," he said. As McGowan, 37, ate the dog, he said: "It's disgusting. It's really, really really disgusting." He added: "It's all wrong &ndash; it's really, really wrong. The protest, what Prince Philip done &ndash; it's all wrong." The radio show's presenter, Bob Smith, said: "I'm not convinced it's corgi." But McGowan insisted that he trusted the the two women who cooked the dog. He said: "It's stinky, it's white-looking, it's not like any meat I've ever seen." The RSPCA said in a statement it had investigated the alleged incident involving Philip at the Queen's Sandringham estate in January and "found no evidence that an offence of causing unnecessary suffering had taken place". It added: "An independent post-mortem examination was carried out and found that the fox died from gunshot wounds &ndash; and no evidence of other injury or trauma was found. "The only witness who could have supported the version of events reported in some sections of the media refused to give a statement." McGowan said after the show that his protest had been "very provocative, intentionally". "To me it was, as an art piece, exhilarating," he added. Poorva Joshipura, director of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' European arm, said: "The idea of eating a corgi will make many people lose their lunch, but certainly foxes who are hunted for so-called entertainment, are no less capable of feeling fear and pain. "Most of the British public will agree that it is high time the royals joined the rest of us who live in the 21st century and are opposed to cruelty to animals." Royal protest ...

And the hypocrite calls it art form. With regard to Foxes,yes they are beautiful creatures and as with all animals,deserve our respect but as they are a threat to other wildlife,our farming industry and are now in plague proportions,as a feral pest, their numbers need to be controlled.But of course,should always be despatched cleanly. As was seen at Sandringham.(Died of Gunshot wounds) I wonder if this chap has he ever seen how much damage they can do in a chicken pen ? In the UK,I lost several chickens and knew a farmer who lost 174 chickens in one night to one fox,which I happily shot the next day. I am pleased to say that now living in Australia,we have a more balanced view of animal rights and feral animal control.Of the 67 foxes I have shot here in 4 visits to a farm,none required a second shot and I have saved an awful lot of native animals,reptiles and birds a premature death. As probably more than 95% of the worlds population still eat meat,maybe those less informed might like to educate themselves a little more on where meat actually comes from for a more balanced view.Or they may like to try vegetarianism themselves.

Iran also refused to budge ahead of talks Thursday between Iran's chief international negotiator and the European Union's senior foreign policy official.

Rice is in Vienna for a conference of women leaders. (AP Photo/Ronald Zak) (Ronald Zak - AP) The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article Asked if it is time to change tactics in the world's nuclear standoff with Iran, Rice ruled out the idea of dropping a key precondition. "I think it's time for Iran to change its tactics," Rice said. There is increasing sentiment in Europe that world powers trying to engage Iran should drop the demand that Iran halt, or suspend in diplomatic parlance, disputed nuclear activities before bargaining on a package of incentives could begin. "The international community is united on what Iran should do, which is to suspend; to demonstrate that it is in fact not seeking a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power," Rice said. She spoke during a press conference with Austria's foreign minister, a year to the day after she made a dramatic outreach to longtime adversary Iran. The offer to talk "anytime, any place," was intended to inject new life into an ebbing European diplomatic effort to turn back Iran's advancing nuclear program. "I think the question isn't why won't we talk to Tehran. The question is why doesn't Tehran want to talk to us." Iran did not accept Rice's offer for the first Cabinet-level direct talks in nearly three decades because of the condition to stop enriching uranium. Enriched uranium is an ingredient for both the peaceful nuclear power Iran claims it wants or for the illicit weapons program that Washington suspects. "I repeat again that if Iran is prepared to take that course then we are prepared to change 27 years of American policy and sit with Iran to talk about whatever Iran would like to talk about," Rice said. "But that can't be done when Iran continues to ... try to perfect technologies that are going to lead to a nuclear weapon." Since Rice's offer, the Bush administration has embarked on a more cautious outreach to Iran. U.S. and Iranian diplomats have met twice to discuss the spiral of violence in . The United States accuses Iran of arming insurgents in next-door Iran, but Iran denies it. The disputed nuclear issue hangs over those limited talks. Tehran recently suggested a readiness to discuss a partial suspension of uranium enrichment, but the U.S. and key allies rejected the overture and Iran pulled back from the idea for starting talks on its nuclear program, diplomats said Wednesday With both sides back at their hard-line stances, an exploratory meeting Thursday between Iran's chief international negotiator and the European Union's senior foreign policy official was unlikely to make substantial headway, the diplomats told The Associated Press. In another sign of defiance, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad boasted that his country's military has become so strong that no adversary would risk an attack. "We have passed our point of vulnerability," he told Iranian state television. Later Thursday, Rice skipped on opportunity to continue a public argument with over U.S. plans to base a missile interceptor system in Europe. Speaking at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Rice did not mention Russia or the controversy that has dominated increasingly troubled U.S.-Russian relations in recent months. Rice referred to the Cold War roots of the organization, begun as a bulwark against the Soviet Union, and said its expansion to include all manner of nations proves her theory that some historical events that seem impossible one day become inevitable. "That is for me, a great benefit and a great inspiration in a world that is in a great deal of turmoil now," Rice said.

The unprecedented legislative move is likely to raise national and regional tensions in the deeply divided country. Lebanese authorities are holding eight people over the killing. They are four pro-Syrian generals who headed Lebanese security departments at the time and four members of a small Syrian-backed Sunni Muslim group accused of having played a role in monitoring Haririâ€™s movements. Early reports from a UN inquiry into Haririâ€™s death implicated Syrian and Lebanese security officials, but the continuing investigation has not recommended who should be indicted. Wednesdayâ€™s resolution breaks an impasse in which Lebanonâ€™s pro-western government supported the court but could not establish it domestically because of opposition from its pro-Syrian opponents in Hizbollah and other factions. It also comes as a serious challenge to the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad, which controlled Lebanon at the time of the car bombing that killed Mr Hariri in February 2005 and which has been accused of involvement in the murder by many Lebanese. Underlining fears of possibly violent consequences, there were reports of a stun grenade explosion in Beirut â€“ with no casualties â€“ immediately after the vote, even as supporters of the countryâ€™s anti-Syrian faction celebrated with fireworks. The Lebanese army was on heightened alert and most streets were empty as residents stayed home or fled in expectation of unrest. An emotional and tearful Saad Hariri, the murdered politicianâ€™s son, called the decision a â€œturning pointâ€ for Lebanon. He said: â€œWe want justice â€“ not revenge.â€ Fouad Siniora, the prime minister, whose government is under intense pressure from the pro-Syrian opposition, called the establishment of the tribunal a â€œvictory for all the Lebanese peopleâ€. Ten of the Councilâ€™s 15 members â€“ including Britain and the US â€“ agreed the measure after weeks of debate over whether the UN should interfere in a country where the prime minister and president are at odds, and whose parliament has closed because of factional disagreement over the court. The resolution followed a collapse in UN mediation efforts and a direct appeal by Mr Siniora for help. The UN vote also carries a broader message in the Arab world, where powerful security agencies are regularly accused of torture, yet remain above the law. Russia, China, Indonesia, South Africa and Qatar abstained, insisting they did want to see Mr Haririâ€™s killers brought to justice, but were concerned over continuing Lebanese divisions and a perceived encroachment on national sovereignty. The resolution will take effect on June 10, unless Lebanese factions pass it in parliament before then. Damascus has made no secret that it will abide only by its national laws and is unlikelyâ€‰toâ€‰sendâ€‰any suspects to an international tribunal.

The announcement came amid a slowdown in violence after two weeks of fighting between Palestinian rocket squads and Israeli forces. The fighting is expected to dominate the agenda of next week&#039;s meeting between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. "The president is working night and day for a mutual, comprehensive cease-fire," said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a top aide to Abbas. Abu Rdeneh said next week&#039;s summit, scheduled for June 7, "is expected in the Palestinian territories." Officials would not say where, but in the past they have mentioned the West Bank oasis of Jericho as the likely venue. While the two leaders have held a series of meetings over the past year, the Palestinians haven&#039;t hosted any of the gatherings. Olmert&#039;s spokeswoman, Miri Eisin, said a West Bank meeting is "a possibility," but said the date and location still have not been finalized. Today in Africa &#038; Middle East Jihadist groups fill a Palestinian power vacuum UN Security Council approves Hariri tribunal Sunni-Kurdish conflict worsens Iraqi disarray Olmert and Abbas promised U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice back in March to meet every two weeks with the aim of moving beyond day-to-day issues and begin discussing the outlines of a final peace agreement. However, the men have met just once since then, in April, and next week&#039;s talks will focus on the fighting. A five-month truce in Gaza unraveled earlier this month when the Hamas militant group began firing barrages of rockets into southern Israel, prompting Israel to respond with a series of airstrikes. More than 50 Palestinians, most of them militants, and two Israeli civilians have been killed. In the latest violence, Israeli aircraft attacked a Palestinian rocket-launching squad in northern Gaza Thursday. No injuries were reported. "We will actively pursue and hit these rocket launchers as well as those who operate them," said David Baker, an official in Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&#039;s office. Despite the flareup, there were signs of a slowdown in fighting. Hamas&#039; military wing, which has been responsible for most of the recent rocket fire, said it has not launched a projectile in 48 hours. "Perhaps there is an unannounced cease-fire," Abu Rdeneh said. The smaller Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for Thursday&#039;s rocket fire. In a separate incident, Islamic Jihad said two members were slightly injured in an Israeli artillery strike. But the army denied involvement. Still, the number of rocket attacks has sharply dropped in recent days. Israel resolved on Wednesday to keep striking Gaza rocket squads and said it wasn&#039;t negotiating a truce with radical groups. Israeli officials believe the Israeli air campaign is the reason for the reduced rocket fire. Abbas, a moderate who favors peacemaking, has been pushing Hamas to restore the Gaza cease-fire. But he has been ineffective in halting militant attacks. Abbas&#039; Fatah movement and Hamas are partners in the Palestinian coalition government. That partnership is extremely fragile, however, and Hamas began attacking Israel in an apparent attempt to halt a fresh wave of Palestinian infighting. Abbas has proposed a truce agreement that would commit Gaza militants to halt their rocket fire for a month to permit negotiations on a more comprehensive cease-fire including the West Bank. Militants have said a truce is out of the question as long as Israel keeps up its attacks and refuses to bring a truce to the West Bank, where it frequently conducts arrest raids. Israel has so far rejected the notion of applying the truce to West Bank, especially in light of the latest round of attacks from Gaza. Meanwhile, Hamas and Fatah are expected to meet next week to discuss shoring up an internal truce called after this month&#039;s infighting, which killed more than 50 Palestinians, said a senior Egyptian security official. Both sides have sent representatives to Cairo to individually speak to Egyptian mediators about the reasons for the latest outbreak in fighting, and the possibilities of coming to a truce with Israel. The two sides are expected to agree to form a committee that will include an impartial Egyptian observer to call judgment on violations of the truce currently holding between Palestinians, said Lt. Col. Burhan Hamad, head of the Gaza-based Egyptian security delegation. "But it&#039;s not a guarantee against fighting," Burhan warned. Although the internal truce has mostly held, mistrust runs deep. Both sides have welcomed Egyptian involvement. "We want to get out of mutual accusations through the refereeing of a third party, trusted by both sides, and that is the Egyptians," said Mohammed Dahlan, a Fatah strongman in Gaza, speaking on an Arab news television station on Thursday.

Some 2,000 people rallied peacefully near Government House a day after the ruling, shouting slogans against the coup leaders who ousted Thaksin in a bloodless putsch last year. The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article "Democracy Back, Thaksin Come Back," read one banner held by a protester wearing a "CNS Get Out" headband, referring to the name the generals gave themselves, the Council for National Security. "Although Thai Rak Thai has been banned, we still love Thaksin," Jatuporn Prompan, a rally organizer and former party spokesman, told the crowd from the stage. "The Constitutional Tribunal has ruled that Thai Rak Thai has committed a crime that was hostile to democracy. But who will make that ruling on the CNS which toppled a democratically elected government?," Jatuporn said. Earlier, Thaksin, who is living in London, issued a statement urging his supporters to accept the ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal, which found his party guilty of two charges of fraud in last year's inconclusive poll, later annulled by the courts. He also pressed the generals to speed up elections promised for December. Analysts say the plan could be derailed by unrest. "I would urge everyone to stay calm and don't make any moves," said the billionaire telecoms tycoon whose Thai Rak Thai (Thais Loves Thais) party was the first in Thai history to win an absolute parliamentary majority. There has been no violence since the ruling, but police set up extra checkpoints across the city of 10 million people. "Nothing has happened yet, but we are worried that a third party could cause trouble," the Bangkok police chief, Lieutenant-General Adisorn Nonsee, told reporters. The rival Democrat Party, Thailand's oldest party but no match for Thaksin's machine in the vote-rich countryside, was found not guilty of breaking election laws, and should now be in pole position for the promised December election.

Huffing and puffing along Sungei Wang Plaza’s 30th birthday bash Art is his first love On the Movie Trail Department ‘wrong’ to deny Lina Joy’s request PUTRAJAYA: The National Registration Department was wrong to reject Lina Joy’s application to remove the word "Islam" from her identity card, according to Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Datuk Richard Malanjum. In his 58-page dissenting opinion in the landmark case yesterday, he noted that Joy had stated in her application that she was a Christian. "This fact was known by the NRD as early as Feb 21, 1997, when she made her application," he said. "Hence, her third application in 1999 should have been processed and the NRD should construe the series of applications as one continuous episode." Malanjum said it was not the function of the NRD to ensure that Lina had properly apostasised as such a matter should be left to the relevant religious authorities to take any action as deemed necessary. "The NRD has not shown that one of its statutory duties is to ensure that a person has properly renounced the Islamic faith in accordance with the requirements of the Islamic authorities." The judge said he agreed with Lina’s counsel that requiring production of a certificate of apostasy was not provided for in the NRD’s regulations. "The NRD had acted ultra vires or illegally," he said. Malanjum said it was wrong to apply Lina’s case retrospectively according to the amendments of the NRD Regulations in March 2000. The regulations require the word "Islam" to be included in the ICs of Malays. "Joy made the application three times from 1997 and the last one in 1999. Surely, those applications should be considered as part of a continuing act. "To confine the matter to the third application only is completely ignoring the history of the plight of the appellant in her dealings with the NRD." The judge said the insistence by the NRD for a certificate of apostasy from the Federal Territory syariah court was not only illegal but unreasonable. "The FT syariah court has no statutory power to adjudicate on the issue of apostasy. "Thus, the insistence was unreasonable for it required the performance of an act that was almost impossible to perform." The FT syariah laws did not have provisions for murtad or renunciation. Malanjum said the principle of administrative law stated that a public authority must not act mechanically and must consider each case on its merits. Hence, in ordering the NRD to remove the word "Islam" from Lina’s IC, Malanjum said the NRD must retain discretion to depart from its policy whenever public interest so demands. Lina was represented by counsel Datuk Dr Cyrus Das, Benjamin Dawson and David Matthews. The FT Islamic Council was represented by Sulaiman Abdullah while the government and NRD director-general was represented by senior federal counsel Azizah Nawawi. 3 killed, 3 injured in crash RM1b Bumi properties unsold Come dance for a good cause 600 athletes to take part in Gurdwara Cup meet Killed in freak accident Labourer hit by bulldozer Four cops claim trial to graft Appeal against ruling on witnesses’ statements New deal for plantation workers 4 footballers ‘red carded’ over drugs Prince ‘a bridge between Islam and modernity’ Risking all for love and money Land Office cuts red tape Teachers want training redefined and redesigned Cybercafes now dens for crime syndicates Strike force to protect checkpoint officers Millionaire yet to repay study loan Smart money is on Malaysia 12,000 families to be out of poor list by year-end No discrimination in education system ‘My whole family is gone now’ Two sides of Penang Allow pilgrims to ‘pay penalty here’ University gets RM3.4m boost Battle that could divide party Two-term V-P Hassan Ali pulls out of race Thousands get a taste of Sabah tradition Student defeats nation’s top chess player Vacant buildings to become prisons Dress, shoes the ‘stars’ at Nur Fazura trial Pekan Fest promises more than just fun ‘MoisturePlus’ contact lens solution to be recalled FREE!!!

Ankara sent more tanks to its border with Iraq this week as part of manoeuvres that have spurred talk of an impending cross-border military operation into northern Iraq to crush Turkish Kurd guerrillas hiding there. "This is spring planning. We can't do it in the winter when temperatures are minus 20-30 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). No new troops have been sent to the region," General Yasar Buyukanit, head of the army General Staff, told reporters. Speculation about an imminent incursion into Iraq has grown since Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said last week he saw eye to eye with the army over possible military action, despite unease in the United States, Turkey's NATO ally, about such a move. Buyukanit said last month a military incursion into northern Iraq was necessary to quash Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants based there. But he stressed on Thursday that the government first needed to make a political decision regarding such an incursion. In Turkey, parliament must authorise military action outside the country's borders. "The political authorities need to decide on this. We can't know whether we will go there and fight only the PKK or deal with (Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud) Barzani as well," he said. The United States has repeatedly urged Turkey not to send troops into Iraq, saying this would only complicate the situation. The two countries have agreed various measures, including financial ones, to try to curb the PKK. But pressure within Turkey for an incursion is growing after a suicide bombing in the capital Ankara last week killed six people and injured scores more. Authorities blamed the attack on the PKK, which denied involvement. More than 30,000 people have died in the conflict with the PKK since the group launched its insurgency in 1984. news is provided by Zoom to full size map Facts & Figures - Landmine casualties (2004) FACTBOX-Military and civilian deaths in Iraq Iran says dead rebels had U.S.-made arms -media May third-worst month for US troop deaths in Iraq Rival insurgent groups clash in Baghdad-residents Iraq says seeking release of kidnapped Britons Iraqi refugee children begin education programmes Source: WV MEERO - Cyprus Annual report &#8211; ICRC boosts aid in face of growing conflict and displacement Source: ICRC - Switzerland Amputee Cyclist to Circumnavigate The Globe For War Victims Source: Clear Path International - USA WER provides further support to Iraqi people Source: WER - UK Iraq: U.S. response to displacement remains inadequate Source: Refugees International - USA The International Red Cross helps Australian-Palestinians, who were visiting family in the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp, retrieve their belongings in northern Lebanon May 30, 2007.

Less noticed has been a jihadist element taking root in Gaza. (Tyler Hicks/The New York Times) Jihadist groups fill a Palestinian power vacuum By Steven Erlanger and Hassan M. Fattah Published: May 30, 2007 It was 2 a.m. when masked gunmen raided Al Wafa Net in the Khan Yunis camp in Gaza, where 17 young men were surfing the Net. "The gunmen tied their hands, then forced them to stand at the stairs while they broke all the screens, and then the server and the television and the photocopier," the owner, Hamad, said of the attack a few months ago. "Then they burned all 36 computers." In recent months in Gaza, there have been similar attacks on music and video shops and pharmacies accused of selling Viagra, as well as on American and United Nations schools. While a standoff between the Lebanese Army and Islamists at a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon has focused attention on a jihadist element taking root there, less noticed has been a radicalization in the Palestinian areas themselves. "There is a security vacuum that creates space for all kinds of new grouplets and forces," said Mouin Rabbani, a Jordan-based analyst of Palestinian politics for the International Crisis Group. Today in Africa &#038; Middle East Jihadist groups fill a Palestinian power vacuum UN Security Council approves Hariri tribunal Sunni-Kurdish conflict worsens Iraqi disarray Palestinian authority used to lie in the hands of Fatah, the nationalist faction once led by Yasser Arafat. But after the entry of the militant group Hamas into politics, its electoral defeat of Fatah in 2006 and the battles between them, jihadist freelancers with murky origins and links are filling a vacuum. Bush administration officials say they are increasingly concerned that Hamas and even more radical groups may be hijacking the Palestinian movement. The officials see no operational connection between what is happening in Palestinian camps in Lebanon and the deterioration in Gaza. But they do see an ideological link, with hopeless and marginalized young people turning to jihad because they believe that more secular or moderate options have failed them. An example can be seen in the squalid streets of the Ain el Hilweh refugee camp outside the southern city of Sidon, Lebanon, where people like Abu Ahmed Taha are bracing for a fight they have long been dreading. Militias in the camp of 47,000 roam the streets armed and ready; skirmishes break out sporadically and tensions have never been higher. For Taha, the real danger is that the fastest growing militias are those of jihadists with wholly different aspirations than his. "There is a central problem and that is Al Qaeda; and they are spreading," Taha said, after an emergency meeting of religious and political leaders in the camp last week to calm tensions. "The Islamic awakening has been going on for 25 years now. But this, now, is going to become a huge problem for us." Taha&#039;s fears are especially remarkable because of who he is: not a secular campaigner or Fatah apparatchik, but a senior member of Hamas. In the violent underground of the militias, men like him have become unlikely moderates, calling for calm and seeking to build bonds with the other militias and the government. Security officials and analysts say Al Qaeda-inspired groups have had a presence in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon for a decade, where they have thrived on the lawlessness and poor living conditions. In Lebanon, Palestinians are not allowed to own property, are limited in the kind of work they can do and generally enjoy few rights. Ain el Hilweh, too, became a jihadist hotbed about five years ago. More than 25 men from there alone have gone to Iraq to fight, Hamas and Fatah officials say, never to be seen again. And jihadists there say more are ready. Taha notes that the new groups make it easy to join. Whereas it may take years of inculcation for a young man to become a full-fledged member of Hamas, they become members of the militias in weeks, he said. And rather than focusing on a political education, they focus on a global fight. A spokesman for Fatah al Islam, the group holed up in the Palestinian camp near the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, said Islamic rule in the region is their aim. A Palestinian state is not even mentioned. "Our goals are beyond Lebanon," said the spokesman, Abu Salim, in a telephone interview. "We want the Levant to be governed by Islam again and then in the whole world. We want to bring people back to Islam, and we want to liberate our land occupied by Zionists." Whether groups like his are part of Al Qaeda or simply local bands of religious fanatics, Westerners and their institutions are now more clearly under attack throughout the region, including in Gaza, as seen in the bombing of the schools and in the kidnappings of two Fox News correspondents and of Alan Johnston, the BBC Gaza correspondent, held since March, in an act claimed by a shadowy group called the Army of Islam.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/8-5&fd=R&url=http://rawstory.com/news/afp/Vote_boycott_over_Japan_mars_whalin_05312007.html&cid=1116354652&ei=m-xeRsngAYf40QHv7IzQDQ The Raw Story | Vote boycott over Japan mars whaling talks Vote boycott over Japan mars whaling talks Published: Thursday May 31, 2007 An unprecedented voting boycott of a resolution on Japan's "lethal" whale hunts marred talks Wednesday of the International Whaling Commission, intensifying rifts in the 75-nation group. The resolution urging Japan to suspend the "lethal aspects" of its scientific whaling program was adopted 40-2 but prompted a boycott by Japan and 26 other mostly pro-whaling nations making up more than one third of the IWC. The non-binding resolution was proposed by New Zealand and sponsored by other anti-whaling nations led by the United States, Britain, Australia, France and South Africa at the annual talks in Anchorage, Alaska. Russia and Norway voted against it while China abstained. "It was a clear division showing the different philosophical camps that are here in the IWC," New Zealand's Conservation Minister Chris Carter told AFP. "It will be bad enough if Japan was just harpooning whales along its own shores but actually it comes down and harpoons our whales," he charged. Japan shot back, calling the move a "hate" resolution. "We had a spirit of compromise at this meeting and the anti-whalers just can't help themselves but to pass hate resolutions," said Japanese delegation spokesman Glenn Inwood. For the first time in IWC history, more than two dozen countries refused to participate in the vote, saying it was divisive and served no purpose, officials said. It underscored the increasing division within the 75-member IWC, which has nearly an equal number of pro- and anti-whaling nations, making it difficult for key policy changes in the commission that require a three-fourths majority. "It was the wrong resolution, at the wrong time and delivered in the wrong tone. It has further undermined the relevance of the IWC," said Eugene Lapointe, president of the International Wildlife Management Consortium World Conservation Trust, a pro-sustainable use group. The IWC, which manages whaling and is in charge of conservation of the creatures, had imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling since 1986 but Japan, according to environmentalists, is exploiting a legal loophole allowing whaling for scientific research. Japan kills about 1,000 whales a year under its scientific program then sells the meat. The Latin American bloc, that included Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico, also voted against Japan on Wednesday. "We are really pleased that all Latin American countries supported us, it shows that the south hemisphere countries are passionate about protecting whales," Carter said. Last year, the anti-whaling group did not risk such a resolution because the whaling countries and their supporters had voting parity with them and it may have been defeated, officials said. Japan last year won a non-binding resolution in favor of commercial whaling, but fell short of the numbers needed to overturn the two-decade moratorium. This year, the anti-whaling group has a narrow majority. Also on Wednesday, Japan made a formal bid at the IWC to overturn the moratorium even though it is expected to fail and worsen a split in the group. Top Japanese delegate Joji Morishita argued that the moratorium had to be lifted to allow Japan's traditional coastal communities to conduct whale hunts. He said they had the same fundamental right to pursue whaling as natives in the United States and Russia. Japan submitted the proposal under the same IWC rules allowing aboriginal subsistence whaling quotas, saying whaling culture dates back centuries ago in the richest Asian nation. "Whales are part of Japanese dietary culture and to tell Japan to stop is nothing short of cultural imperialism," Inwood said. The United States, Britain, India, France, Australia and Brazil spoke against the Japanese move. During the debate, British Biodiversity Minister Barry Gardiner was cautioned after using what was termed "derogatory" language. He branded Japan a "perpetrator," implying that Tokyo's scientific whaling was unlawful although IWC rules allow such an activity. Gardiner said based on the tone of Morishita's remarks, "delegates might be forgiven for thinking that Japan is the victim here." He then said, "It is not. It is a perpetrator." The delegate from Norway, a Japan ally and a fiercely pro-whaling nation together with Iceland, cautioned that the word "perpetrator" could be a "derogatory" term. IWC chairman William Hogarth, noting the sensitivities involved among the diverse group of countries at the talks, pleaded for restraint in comments. IWC meetings have always been characterized by strong language and emotional arguments.

Shakeri, a California-based businessman who also works for a private conflict-resolution group called the Center for Citizen Peacebuilding, has been detained in Tehran's Evin prison, State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said. Iranian officials confirmed on Tuesday that two other US-Iranian scholars, Haleh Esfandiari and Kian Tajbakhsh, had been detained on spying charges and that a fourth dual national, journalist Parnaz Azima, faced similar allegations but had not been arrested.

A multi-ethnic state composed largely of Muslim Malays, Christian and Buddhist Chinese, and Hindu and Sikh Indians, Malaysia has long prided itself on its diversity of faiths. To safeguard this religious heterogeneity, the country's constitution sets out a dual-track legal system in which Muslims are bound by Shari'a law for issues such as marriage, property and death, while members of other faiths follow civil law. Malaysia at a Crossroads The culturally diverse nation is struggling to strike a balance between its secular constitution and its Muslim majority A New vision for Malaysia Malaysians expected Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi to be cautious, but he has quickly emerged as a bold reformer But the parallel system has occasionally faced snags. Joy is a Malay originally known as Azlina Jailani, and by Malaysian law her ethnicity automatically makes her a Muslim subject to Shari'a law. In order to make her 1990 conversion to Christianity legal, she needed permission from the Shari'a courts, which consider a renunciation of Islam a major offense. But, since she is still classified as a Muslim by the state, Joy was not allowed to have her case heard by the civil courts. Her six-year-long campaign to convince the civil system to legalize her conversion failed, prompting her appeal to the Federal Court, after the Court of Appeal rejected her claim in September 2005. On Wednesday, the Court announced that it had no jurisdiction over the case since it was under the purview of Shari'a law, effectively punting on any attempt to clear up the gray space that exists between Malaysia's two legal systems. The ruling was greeted by shouts of "God is great!" from many in the assembled crowd outside the Palace of Justice in Kuala Lumpur. More secular observers were far less jubilant. "I see this case not just as a question of religious preference but one of a potential dismantling of Malaysia's ... multi-ethnic, multi-religious &#91;character&#93;," warned Malik Imtiaz Sarwar, a member of Joy's legal team, before the decision was announced. The Joy verdict, which will likely become a precedent for several other pending conversion cases, is seen by many in Malaysia as evidence of how religious politics are cleaving the nation, with a creeping Islamization undermining the rights of both non-Muslims and more moderate adherents to Islam. Last November, at a party conference for the Muslim-dominated United Malays National Organization ruling party, one delegate vowed he would be willing to "bathe in blood" to defend his ethnicity &#151; and, by extension, his religion. In several Malaysian states, forsaking Islam is a crime punishable by prison time. Earlier this week, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who in December acknowledged that race relations in his homeland were "fragile," hosted the World Islamic Economic Forum in Kuala Lumpur. In an era where Islam is so often partnered with extremism and autocratic governance, Malaysia was held up at the annual conference as a model of a moderate Muslim nation committed to safeguarding the rights of its diverse population. But the Federal Court's verdict on Joy's case, which represented her last legal recourse, may undercut that reputation. After all, is it complete religious freedom if a 42-year-old woman isn't allowed to follow the faith of her choosing?

Gaza: Israeli bombing won't bring peace any more than previous military crackdowns. American-Israeli help to bolster President Mahmoud Abbas' security forces won't stop Hamas from acquiring more rockets to hurl at Israel. The Saudi-sponsored unity government between Fatah and Hamas won't end their internecine warfare. "The problem is Gaza itself," writes Fawaz Turki, author of The Disinherited: Journal of a Palestinian Exile , who lives in Washington. "Israel may have evacuated its miserable colonists and soldiers from Gaza but it continues to control its airspace, offshore maritime access and its borders, determining the flow of goods, produce and people ... "The cumulative impact of sustained economic hardship, coupled with living under the thumb of a foreign occupier can be devastating to an individual's psychological, even cognitive and social functioning ... "Communities made inert by repression, social immobility or economic deprivation, will build up an inescapable drive towards war, towards an assertion of identity at the cost of mutual destruction." The World Bank, too, recently criticized the Israeli stranglehold on Gaza and the West Bank, the latter cut up into "ever smaller and disconnected cantons." Neither the Palestinian civil war nor the breakdown of the months-long ceasefire with Israel should have come as a surprise. Lebanon: About 400,000 Palestinian refugees there remain marginalized â€“ denied citizenship and restricted to menial jobs. It is in one of their 12 camps that Beirut is battling Fatah al-Islam, which vows to "fight the Jews and take the holy war to the frontiers of Palestine." Rushing U.S. military supplies to Prime Minister Fouad Siniora may help him crush this militia, but it won't guarantee that others won't emerge. Fatah al-Islam may or may not be the creation of Syria. The more relevant point is that it is easy for anyone to start a militia in the midst of misery. The other point is that Lebanon is politically paralyzed between pro- and anti-Hezbollah elements. Attacking Fatah al-Islam is easy, disarming the Hezbollah is not, so strong it emerged from last year's Israeli invasion. Iraq and Afghanistan: The U.S. presence in both has been a boon to terrorists. The U.S. State Department says terrorism shot up 25 per cent last year â€“14,338 attacks that killed 20,498 people, most in Iraq and Afghanistan. The leader of Fatah al-Islam was an associate of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the notorious Al Qaeda terrorist who was killed in Iraq last summer. Other jihadis from Iraq may be operating well beyond Lebanon, as indicated by terrorist incidents in Morocco and Algeria. Jihadi tactics from Iraq are being copied in Afghanistan. Propping up prime ministers Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad and Hamid Karzai in Kabul won't guarantee any more success than propping up Abbas and Siniora. They have been rendered ineffective by the Israeli and American policies of occupations and endless war, with criminal disregard for civilian casualties and human suffering. Enter the radicals â€“ and Iran. Bilateral U.S.-Iran talks, long overdue and at last underway, won't end the carnage in Iraq. Tehran has little incentive to help there while the U.S. â€“ backed by some Sunni Arab dictators â€“ continues its sabre-rattling over the Iranian nuclear program. "The failure to find political and institutional solutions in Palestine, Lebanon and Iraq, along with the American rivalry with Iran for regional influence, has stirred up all kinds of conflicts and created a field day for militias, large and small," says Prof. Jim Reilly, a University of Toronto expert on the Middle East. "They have let loose a host of furies" â€“ none easily contained. , the Star's editorial page editor emeritus, appears Thursday in World and Sunday in the A-section.

Alaa Hadidi, spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, voiced the dissatisfaction over the Quartet's Wednesday statement in a speech to local diplomatic editors, the official MENA news agency reported. The Quartet statement was a tantamount to a green light to to launch more attacks against the Palestinians, Hadidi was quoted as saying. After a meeting in Berlin Wednesday, diplomats from the Quartet, which groups , the United Nations and the European Union, called for an immediate stop of violence in the Mideast region as fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants continued to flare up. Hadidi noted that the Quartet asked the Palestinians to hold their fire while urged Israel to avoid fall of civilians during military operations in the Palestinian lands. "How can Israel avoid death of civilians while using heavy weapons in bombing targets located in residential areas?" The unbalanced statement jeopardizes the credibility of the Quartet as a neutral side, warned the Egyptian official. Hadidi also rejected Quartet's call for unconditional release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit who was kidnapped by Palestinian militant groups in June last year. The Quartet remarks will not help Egyptian efforts aiming at clinching a deal to free Shalit in return for some Palestinian prisoners, said Hadidi, criticizing the international group for failing to condemn the recent Israeli "kidnapping" of Palestinian lawmakers. The Quartet statement also misinterpreted the Arab Peace Initiative reactivated by Arab leaders during their summit meeting in Riyadh in late March, which provides a complete vision of a comprehensive peace in the region that will not be realized unless Israel withdrew from all occupied Arab lands, Hadidi said. However, the Egyptian official welcomed Quartet's support for holding dialogue between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President , expressing Cairo's support to Quartet's call for an Israeli halt to settlement construction.

Lina Joy, 42, had fought the decisions of Malaysia's lower courts in an effort to have the word "Islam" removed from her identity card, arguing that the constitution guaranteed her religious freedom. But the panel of three judges decided, in a majority verdict, that it had no power to intervene in cases of apostasy. These cases fall under the jurisdiction of Malaysia's Sharia courts, which run in tandem with the country's civil courts. However, it has never been made clear which branch of the court takes precedence. The Malaysian constitution guarantees freedom of worship, but ethnic Malays must be Muslim by law. "She cannot simply, at her own whim, enter or leave her religion," Judge Ahmad Fairuz said during yesterday's ruling. "She must follow rules." But Judge Richard Malanjum, the only non-Muslim on the panel, said it was "unreasonable" to ask Ms Joy to turn to the Sharia court as she could face criminal prosecution because abandoning Islam is punishable by a fine or jail. Critics of the verdict expressed dismay and said it failed to uphold the legal rights of Malaysians. Two-hundred Muslim protesters who gathered in a prayer vigil outside the court yesterday greeted the verdict with cries of "Allahu Akbar" (God is great). Islam is the official religion in Malaysia, where 60% of the country's 27 million people are ethnic Malay. The woman, born Azlina Jailani, started attending church in 1990 and was baptised eight years later.

That, at least, was what happened when the G-8 foreign ministers gathered in Germany on Wednesday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice exchanged verbal blows at the G-8 press conference Wednesday. Clashes between Russia and the US soured a meeting of G-8 foreign ministers on Wednesday, just one week before the main summit kicks off in Heiligendamm on Germany's Baltic coast. At the press conference in Potsdam, the site of the historic conference between the victorious Allies at the end of World War II, Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov struck out at US plans to erect a missile defense system in Eastern Europe. He also criticized US policy on Kosovo and Lebanon. Lavrov accused Washington of launching a new arms race, saying that the US rationale for the shield was thin and that Moscow was not placated by the reassurances it had received. "All they are saying is 'don't worry it's not aimed at you,'" he complained. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice retorted that her country had repeatedly explained its plan to Russia. And she said that she agreed with Russian President Vladimir Putin's assessment that Russia's own strategic defenses could easily overpower the US system. "I hope that nobody has to actually prove that Condi is right about that," was Lavrov's sardonic response. The US want to deploy a radar system in the Czech Republic, along with inceptor missiles in Poland, to defend against possible threats from rogue states. However, Moscow perceives the move as part of a steady encroachment on its former sphere of influence. In the latest development in the escalating dispute between the two sides, Russia tested a new multiple-warhead intercontinental ballistic missile on Tuesday. Putin said on Thursday that the test was in direct response to US steps that have upset the strategic balance. The two ministers also announced that US President George W. Bush and Putin will meet at the beginning of July for bilateral talks at the private home of Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, in Maine. But the missile defense shield is not the only point of discord between the two countries. They are also sparring over the future of Kosovo. Russia backs Serbia, which opposes a UN plan to offer independence to the Albanian-majority province. Western powers are in favor of the plan, proposed by the UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari. "We and several of my European colleagues here believe that the Ahtisaari report provides the right basis for resolving the issue," Rice told the news conference. But Lavrov was combative on this issue too: "Our positions are diametrically opposed and I don't see any chances of the positions moving any closer together," he told the news conference. The Russian top diplomat also sniped at recent US arms shipments to the Lebanese army, which is currently engaged in fighting militants in Palestinian refugee camps, accusing Washington of "interfering in Lebanese affairs."

Chancellor Angela Merkel had hoped that the leaders of the world's industrialized leaders and Russia could reach a breakthrough on tackling climate change and poverty in Africa. However, there are already indications that the US could decide any meaningful decisions on moves to curb climate change. While the Europeans want to set strict benchmarks for emissions reductions, the US prefers increasing the use of alternative energy -- to reduce dependency on oil. Although the Potsdam meeting could hardly be deemed a great success, there were some noises of unity from within the G-8. In a joint statement the foreign ministers said that they regretted that Iran was expanding its uranium enrichment activities. And Afghanistan and Pakistan, invited by Germany to attend Wednesday's meeting, vowed to deepen cooperation between their governments "at all levels," including border management, the fight against terrorism and the issue of Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

The Taliban said 35 people died in the helicopter crash in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan. Hours after the helicopter went down, the Taliban ambushed a police convoy on a main road in southern Zabul province and killed 16 policemen, the interior ministry said. Since the traditional winter lull, the resurgent Taliban have stepped up actions in recent months with a series of suicide attacks, roadside bombs and ambushes against foreign and Afghan forces. In an apparent response to the Chinook crash, a joint NATO and Afghan raid supported by air power killed and wounded dozens of Taliban in Sangin district, close to Kajaki where the twin-rotor NATO helicopter went down on Wednesday night, the Afghan defence ministry said. NATO said the fighting was part of a broader offensive called "Operation Lastay Kulang," from the local Pashto language for "axe handle," meant to extend the Afghan government's control into the north of Helmand province. Officials said 2,000 foreign and Afghan troops, including 1,000 British soldiers and elements of the elite U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, were involved in a push to loosen the Taliban's grip on the Sangin Valley. Helmand, a long-time bastion of the Taliban, is the leading drug-producing region of Afghanistan, the world's main heroin supplier. It has been the scene of a series of bloody fights between Taliban and Western forces in recent months. &copy; Reuters 2007.

Speaking a week before he meets leaders of the Group of Eight (G-8) industrial nations in Germany, Putin said Russia's tests on Tuesday of a two new missiles were a direct response to U.S. moves to create a missile defense system. "We are not the initiators of this new round of the arms race," Putin told a joint Kremlin news conference with visiting Greek President Karolos Papoulias. "There is no need to fear Russia's actions: they are not aggressive," he said. "They are a mere response to harsh and groundless unilateral actions by our partners and are aimed at maintaining the balance of forces in the world." Putin's comments, which will be popular among ordinary Russians in a year when there is a parliamentary election, are the latest in a line of harsh outbursts against the West. Russia on Tuesday test-fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile with multiple warheads and a new cruise missiles, which Russian generals say are sufficient to ensure the country's security for the next 40 years. "Our partners are stuffing eastern Europe with new weapons," Putin said. "What are we supposed to do? We cannot just observe all this." Moscow has been alarmed by U.S. plans to deploy elements of its global missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Washington says it wants to avert attacks from "rogue states" such as Iran but Russia sees a threat to its own security. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

(REUTERS) VATICAN CITY • The parents of Madeleine McCann, the British girl who disappeared in Portugal nearly a month ago, had an emotional meeting yesterday with Pope Benedict XVI, who said he would pray for their daughter's return. The pope spent several minutes talking with Gerry and Kate McCann — both devout Roman Catholics —following his weekly audience in Saint Peter's Square. During the meeting, the pontiff placed his hand on a photograph of four-year-old Madeleine that Kate McCann had carried with her. The McCanns, both dressed in black, were visibly moved by their meeting with Pope Benedict, although Gerry confessed afterwards to mixed emotions. "It was more personal than I could ever imagine it could have been ... and his touch, words and thoughts were more tender than we could have hoped and that will help sustain us," he told reporters. "In ordinary circumstances of course it would be the highlight of any Catholic to come and meet the pope. Of course it is saddened with the very marked realisation that our daughter is still missing," he said. Madeleine went missing from Portugal's southern Algarve holiday resort of Praia de Luz on May 3. She is believed to have been abducted as she slept with her two-year-old twin brother and sister in a hotel apartment at the Ocean Club Resort while her parents dined at a nearby restaurant. Kate McCann said the Pope had some comforting words for them both.

Mark McGowan, 37, said the cooked dog - the Queen's favourite breed - tasted "really, really, really disgusting". The corgi, which died at a breeding farm, was minced with apple and onion, reports Sky News. The artist ate it on the Bob and Roberta Smith radio programme, broadcast on London-based station 104.4 Resonance FM. Before the show, the vegetarian and animal rights activist explained his motives for the protest. He said: "I know some people will find this offensive and tasteless. "But I am doing this to raise awareness about the RSPCA's inability to prosecute Prince Philip and his friends shooting a fox earlier this year, letting it struggle for life for five minutes and then beating it to death with a stick." The radio show's presenter, Bob Smith, said: "I'm not convinced it's corgi." But Mr McGowan insisted that he trusted the the two ladies who cooked the dog. He said: "It's stinky, it's white-looking, it's not like any meat I've ever seen." The RSPCA said in a statement it had investigated the alleged incident involving Philip at the Queen's Sandringham estate in January and "found no evidence that an offence of causing unnecessary suffering had taken place". - Ananova.com Car Insurance for Women USA Green Card Program Win Now For Real Now you can get all your news - from politics in South Africa, the quirkiest stories in Step Beyond, the latest from the worlds of Motoring, Entertainment and Business - in one place. and you'll have all the latest news at your fingertips.

Minutes after the vote, which was carried live on local satellite channels, Hariri's son and heir, Lebanon's parliament majority leader MP Saad Hariri made an emotional speech, welcoming the decision and calling on the Lebanese to unite. "Let's all join hands in defending the international tribunal .. .as an opportunity for all Lebanese to unite," said Hariri in a televised statement. "This tribunal is for all Lebanon ... putting an end to the criminal terror intimidating Lebanon," said Hariri choking back tears. "We are seeking justice to hold to account the perpetrators. " Premier Fouad Seniora, also on local television stations, said the trial for the murder of Hariri would allow for "the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth" to be revealed. Seniora said that the court is not targeted at any specific country, and the passing of the resolution signified the international communities' endorsement for the independence and sovereignty of Lebanon. Seniora also urged the Lebanese to join hands and overcome their differences after the vote in New York. After the vote, celebratory gunfire were heard as Hariri's supporters gathered at the downtown grave of the former premier. As shown in local TV footage, many supporters were distributing sweets to passerby while others lit columns of candles as a tribute to Hariri. Others, however, warned of a possible flare-up of security incidents in the wake of the resolution. Echoing a warning by Damascus on Wednesday that the Security Council's move could plunge Lebanon into more instability, some critics of the tribunal also warned of possible trouble ahead. An article written by Omar Neshabi, which is carried by the pro- opposition al-Akhbar newspaper on Thursday, said setting up the court without consensus "raises serious concern for security and stability." "The establishment of the court according to an international resolution and without the agreement of a large segment of citizens... widens and deepens the fracture among Lebanese," said the article. The pro-government An Nahar newspaper, while hailing the UN resolution, voiced security concerns in its Thursday story on the vote, too. Ali Hamadeh, a columnist from the paper said "the rope was tightening around the neck of the murderers" but warned the court "may not bring immediate security. It may push those harmed (by it) to threaten, intimidate and sabotage." Within minutes after the vote, an explosion struck Beirut's Shiyyah district on late Wednesday. The blast caused no damages or casualties, but it is the sixth attack in the country since May 20, when fighting broke out between the army and militants at the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp allegedly linked to al-Qaida and The UN Security Council adopted the resolution on Wednesday to establish the international tribunal. Among the 15 members of the council, 10 voted in favor and five -- The resolution slated a grace period until June 10 for the Lebanese parties to ratify an earlier agreement reached in November by the United Nations and the Lebanese government to establish the court. Otherwise, the resolution's provisions shall enter into force immediately. Lebanese President Emile Lahoud had urged the UN Security Council to stay out of the country's political infighting and not to impose the tribunal. Lebanon is facing its worst crisis since the end of the 1975- 1990 civil war, being locked in a political impasse arose from the power struggle between the anti-Syrian bloc and the pro-Syrian opposition, with the issue of setting up of the international tribunal, along with the formation of a national unity government, being the two major points of contention. Anti-Syrian politicians in Lebanon have blamed Syria for Hariri 's killing in Beirut in February 2005. Syria has denied any involvement.

Much of his claims were taken at face value, with little attempt to analyse why MI6 would believe that the former KGB officer was interested in betraying his country and what they could have offered him as an inducement." /> Lugovoy revels in spotlight as Russia sezies on claims-News-World-Europe-TimesOnline Our exclusive four-step guide to giving up before the ban Navigation - link to other main sections from here How does the government plan to save the planet now? Lugovoy revels in spotlight as Russia sezies on claims Andrei Lugovoy's sensational accusation that British Secret Services were involved in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko led the main television news bulletins in Russia. Much of his claims were taken at face value, with little attempt to analyse why MI6 would believe that the former KGB officer was interested in betraying his country and what they could have offered him as an inducement. Mr Lugovoy gave no clue, saying only that he had evidence to support his allegations that he was willing to share with Russia's Prosecutor-General and the Crown Prosecution Service. His allegations against Boris Berezovsky, a hate figure in the Kremlin and much of Russia, were also predictably given considerable prominence in the reports. Shadowy ex-KGB major takes cover Andrei Lugovoy told Russian news agencies he had nothing to do with Litvinenko's death and that the charge is politically motivated Pushing Russia too far risks breaking political and economic bonds Full video of interview with Marina Litvinenko Litvinenko was told that he was marked for death Curse of the Moscow bombs 'British spies' killed Litvinenko, says suspect Claim by claim: Lugovoy's theories examined The level of media interest in Mr Lugovoy's press conference was extraordinary, with around 30 TV cameras from Russian and international broadcasting companies and a hall packed with journalists and photographers. Russian television swiftly broadcast reaction from leading political figures, who called for a thorough investigation. Mr Lugovoy's allegations reversed the position in which Russian officials have often been on the defensive against claims of state involvement in Mr Litvinenko's death. Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the foreign relations committee of the Duma, Russia's parliament, called the allegations "most interesting" and said: "All of these matters should be investigated very seriously and I hope we will have good cooperation from our British colleagues." Some analysts expressed scepticism at Mr Lugovoy's version of events. Peter Lavelle, political commentator on Russia Today, the state-funded English language channel, said that it did not answer the question of where the polonium-210 used to poison Mr Litvinenko had come from. Mr Lugovoy appears at times to revel in the attention he has received as a result of this case, even as he strenuously protests his innocence. He ended his press conference, broadcast live on Russian television, with a strong appeal to patriotism that appeared calculated to strike a chord with viewers. Recalling that his grandfather had fought in the Russo-Japanese war and his father in Berlin in World War Two, Mr Lugovoy said: "I was brought up as a real Russian officer, a real Russian military man. "I am proud that Russia is once again standing up fully as a country that has always influenced geo-politics and will continue in future....Ten years ago nobody thought about Russia but now they will have to deal with Russia." Mr Lugovoy is accompanied by bodyguards from his own security firm wherever he goes in public now. He said that he feared for his life if he travelled to London to answer the allegation against him, but he clearly also feels insecure in Moscow. He must be hoping that he can protect himself against whoever might be involved in Russia by making accusations so publicly against MI6 and Mr Berezovsky. It is a high-risk balancing act in a case that grows murkier with each new revelation. * Town / City Save to my times Madeleine police use psychic reports in hunt for girl Lugovoy revels in spotlight as Russia sezies on claims Claim by claim: Lugovoy's theories examined Fear and celebration greets Hariri tribunal vote by UN Hunt for Britons goes on amid Iraqi violence Woman dies after electricity cut off 'More tender than we could imagine' Where a spell of fame begins with a bee Charles Bremner's Paris weblog How to flatter, and how to offend, a Frenchwoman Footage of the young girl before her abduction Latest from Bronwen Maddox, Chief Foreign Commentator of The Times You can get beer for children now?

The quartet &#8212; Russia, the United States, the U.N. and the European Union &#8212; met Wednesday in Berlin and issued a statement urging "all Palestinians to immediately renounce all acts of violence and respect the cease-fire." It called on the Palestinian authority "to do everything necessary to restore law and order." It condemned the firing of rockets into southern Israel from Gaza and the buildup of arms by Hamas militants and "other terrorist groups" in Gaza. The four countries also called for the release of British Broadcasting Corp. journalist Alan Johnston, who was kidnapped in Gaza on March 12. Russian denies involvement in Litvinenko killing Bicycle programs catching on in major cities Europe leads in designing buildings that save energy The four Quartet diplomats &#8212; German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon &#8212; met at the Foreign Ministry in Berlin. The group has seen renewed activity in recent months, though violence has continued. They plan to meet again in June, this time with Arab representative in the Middle East. New violence in the region has further dimmed prospects for significant peace efforts. On Wednesday, Israel&#039;s Security Cabinet said it would continue its two-week-old campaign of airstrikes against cells of Hamas militants firing rockets across the Gaza border. Hamas&#039; supreme leader vowed the attacks on Israel would continue. The Quartet produced the stalled road map peace plan that was to culminate with statehood for the Palestinians. Germany, which holds the European Union and G-8 presidencies, has been keen to restore energy to the Quartet group, and it has held several meetings this year.

(Xinhua Photo) GAZA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli air and ground forces expanded Tuesday its crackdown operation against militants of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in the Gaza Strip. More ground forces of the Israeli army have been sent into Palestinian controlled territories in northern and southern Gaza Strip, leaving the door opened for more escalation of the conflict with Hamas militants. Palestinian security sources said that for the first time in two weeks, Israel sent a ground force backed by more than 20 tanks and armored vehicles into an area southeast Gaza Strip, killing two Hamas militants. Palestinian medics at Abu Yosef al-Najjar in the town of Rafah in southern Gaza Strip said that three more civilians were moderately injured, including a 32-year-old woman during the Israeli incursion. The area that was stormed was not far from the commercial crossing of Sofa, east of Rafah town on the borders between Gaza and Israel, where witnessed the kidnapping of Israeli corporal Gilad Shalit almost one year ago. Witnesses said that after the Israeli soldiers killed the two Hamas militants, they stormed into several houses and detained two brothers of one of the two militants. Tuesdays' incursion into Rafah area is the first ground operation since the beginning of the Israeli operation on Hamas militants who fire rockets at southern Israel on May 17, said the Palestinian security officials. Before that, Israel has been hitting Hamas targets from air, killing 48 Palestinians. At predawn on Tuesday, Israeli warplanes have not left the air of Gaza, where it had targeted a building belongs to Hamas movement in the town of Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza Strip, but no injuries were reported. Following a meeting of the Israeli cabinet held on Sunday, Israeli Premier Ehud Olmert vowed to expand military actions on Gaza militants, whether militants halt or continue rockets attacks on Israel. Meanwhile, Hamas movement's armed wing spokesman vowed that attacks on Israel would continue "as long as Israel continues its aggression on our people and the men of resistance."

Iran&#x2019;s chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani reiterated that he would not give in to demands that his country suspend uranium enrichment over fears it is developing nuclear weapons. Iran denies that it is secretly developing atom bombs. Larijani is due to hold talks today with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana amid a long-running argument between Iran and the west over the Islamic republic&#x2019;s nuclear programme. Diplomats do not expect a breakthrough. &#x201C;If Iran continues to ignore demands of the Security Council, we will support further appropriate measures as agreed in Resolution 1747,&#x201D; the Group of Eight (G-8) foreign ministers said in a statement issued at a meeting in Potsdam, Germany. The G-8 statement expressed &#x201C;deep regret that Iran, as we saw in the latest report by the director general (of the International Atomic Energy Agency), has continued to expand its enrichment activities&#x201D;. Security Council resolution 1747 gave Tehran a 60-day deadline to freeze all enrichment work. Iran ignored the deadline, which expired last week. The term &#x201C;appropriate measures&#x201D; is widely seen as diplomatic code for sanctions. The council has already imposed two rounds of sanctions on Iran for failing to suspend uranium enrichment. Besides major western powers and Japan, the G-8 also includes Russia, which has backed previous UN resolutions while stressing Iran&#x2019;s right to a peaceful nuclear programme. Today&#x2019;s meeting between Larijani and Solana, acting on behalf of world powers, will be the first since US and Iranian officials held rare face-to-face discussions in Iraq, although atomic affairs were not on the agenda in Baghdad. The US , which accuses Iran of seeking to build an atomic bomb, has been leading efforts to isolate it over its nuclear programme and also says it is stirring up violence in Iraq. Iran denies both charges. &#x201C;Suspension is not a solution to Iran&#x2019;s nuclear issue &#x2026; Iran cannot accept suspension,&#x201D; Larijani said in Tehran before leaving for Madrid, where he will meet Solana. &#x201C;We have no conditions and we are ready for constructive talks but we will not accept any preconditions. We are ready to remove concerns over Iran&#x2019;s atomic issue.&#x201D; Previous meetings have failed to persuade Tehran to obey UN resolutions demanding it halt enrichment. &#x201C;We are ready to hold talks without preconditions, any day, any time, but they (the Europeans) should change their logic and use this opportunity which Iran has created for constructive talks. Previous methods will lead them nowhere,&#x201D; Larijani said. Also at Potsdam yesterday Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned other world powers not to decide the fate of Kosovo on their own, saying talks between only Belgrade and Pristina could solve a row over independence for the Serbian province. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice yesterday dismissed separate concerns from Russia over a proposed US missile shield in Poland and the Czech republic.

Despite 27 nations not voting, the resolution urging Japan to suspend the "lethal aspects" of its scientific whaling programme was adopted 40-2 on Wednesday. The vote prompted a boycott by Japan and 26 other mostly pro-whaling nations making up more than one-third of the IWC. The non-binding resolution was proposed by and sponsored by other anti-whaling nations led by the at the annual talks in voted against it while 's conservation minister, said: "It was a clear division showing the different philosophical camps that are here in the IWC. "It will be bad enough if was just harpooning whales along its own shores, but actually it comes down and harpoons our whales," he said. Managing the world's whales International Whaling Commission (IWC) founded 1946 to regulate and protect whales, which had been hunted to the brink of extinction Blanket moratorium on commercial whaling introduced 1986 Three IWC members hunt whales in significant numbers: An exemption to the moratorium allows indigenous communities in places like Greenland and Significant policy changes such as lifting moratorium require a 75 per cent majority vote in IWC called the move a "hate" resolution. Glenn Inwood, the Japanese delegation spokesman, said: "We had a spirit of compromise at this meeting and the anti-whalers just can't help themselves but to pass hate resolutions." For the first time in IWC history, more than two dozen countries refused to participate in the vote, saying it was divisive and served no purpose, officials said. It underscored the increasing division within the 75-member IWC, which has nearly an equal number of pro- and anti-whaling nations, making it difficult for policy changes in the commission that require a three-fourths majority. Eugene Lapointe, president of the International Wildlife Management Consortium World Conservation Trust, a pro-sustainable use group, said: "It was the wrong resolution, at the wrong time and delivered in the wrong tone. "It has further undermined the relevance of the IWC." The IWC, which manages whaling and is in charge of conservation of the creatures, had imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling since 1986 but , according to environmentalists, is exploiting a legal loophole allowing whaling for scientific research. kills about 1,000 whales a year under its scientific programme then sells the meat. Japanese whaling fleets head for the Southern Ocean every summer. "I just think that the Japanese have been very selfish and going against the views of the people of the southern hemisphere," Carter said. Japan kills about 1,000 whales a year under its scientific programme [ICR] last year won a non-binding resolution in favour of commercial whaling, but fell short of the numbers needed to overturn the two-decade moratorium. This year, the anti-whaling group has a narrow majority. made a formal bid at the IWC to overturn the moratorium even though it is expected to fail and worsen a split in the group. Joji Morishita, senior Japanese delegate, argued that the moratorium had to be lifted to allow 's traditional coastal communities to conduct whale hunts. He said they had the same fundamental right to pursue whaling as natives in the , submitting the proposal under the same IWC rules allowing aboriginal subsistence whaling quotas. were against the Japanese proposal, to be decided on Thursday, the final day of the four-day talks.

Due to China¡¯s protest, North.. Golden Buddha Stolen From Hae.. Signs of Clash Over Rice Loan? Things Were OK Until Today¡¦ By Park Hyun Min The third day of the 21st Inter-Korea Cabinet Talks may see North Korea making a proposal regarding the ¡°400,000tons of rice¡± to South Korea. From 2.30PM on the 30th, the North¡¯s chief delegate spent about 30 minutes requesting South Korea to ¡°deliver on its promises on the rice loan.¡± The overall analysis is that North Korea was reconnoitering the scene before it made any concrete requests. Public information officer for the Unification Ministry Kim Nam Shik said, ¡°The keynote address that was made by both parties had underlying comments to dwell upon¡± and revealed, ¡°Nothing has been agreed as yet. Rather we must discuss these matters through the executive meetings.¡± However, at the official dinner held on the evening of 30th at Walker Hill Hotel, there are signs to suggest that Unification Minister Lee Jae Jung and North Korea¡¯s Cabinet Secretary Kwon Ho Woong may have had a clash over the issue of the rice loan to be discussed on the 31st. At this gathering, Secretary Kwon said slurring his sentence, ¡°The visit was pleasant, the meals and even until today, everything was good¡¦ but,¡± then, Minister Lee responded holding Kwon¡¯s hands, ¡°It doesn't end today. Just as today was good, tomorrow will be good¡¦¡± ¡°It would be perfect if the day after tomorrow is good and good for forevermore¡¦¡± Minister Kwon said reverberating his words. Meanwhile from within the talks, others proposed, ¡°For two days North Korea has been eyeing South Korea¡¯s maneuvers and has not yet officially sought the issue of rice. This may be a planned strategy to propose the rice loan issue at the end of the talks.¡± At the 13th Inter-Korean Economic Cooperation Promotion Committee in April, the South Korean government agreed to loan North Korea food aid and send the first lot of rice by the end of May. However, as North Korea¡¯s implementation of the February 13 Agreement was delayed, the rice loan became linked to the matter which resulted in reserving the rice loan. If North Korea strongly requests for the rice loan, it seems that the South Korean government will use a defense in convincing North Korea that the settlement made would go ahead as normal and that the rice was merely delayed. As Minister Lee asserts, its not that the rice ¡°will not be given, not cannot be given,¡± its merely that the situation is being postponed. If the rice issue is resolved smoothly, the South Korean government plans to dive into the Inter-Korea joint meeting of national policy research institutions, the Ministers¡¯ meeting between South¡¯s and North¡¯s National Defense Ministry and economic cooperative negotiation which were proposed at the 1st General Meeting by the South. The most critical argument the South Korean government has opted to take is a ¡°peace¡± and ¡°one national economy.¡± While South Korea strives for a ¡°peace¡± and North Korea ¡°economic cooperation,¡± it seems that the South Korean government is trying kill two birds with one stone. Further as the normalization of U.S.-North Korea relations and Japan-North Korea relations working groups of the six party talks continues to make progress, some calculate that the working groups revolving the two Korea¡¯s will also heed to this pace. Since North Korea¡¯s speech at the June 15th Summit Talks in 2000, the two countries have been making steady progress. Additionally, North Korea stated that foreign pressures had to be eliminated from the issue of one nation and that the remaining remnants of the Cold War also had to be removed. North Korea raised the question on the ¡°Reception Staging Onward Movement and Integration¡± and ¡°abrogation of National Safety Law,¡± which have been mentioned since the 17th Inter-Korea Talks in 2005. However, at this current stage, many argue that rather than anticipating any immediate measures, continuous efforts and talks would be more profitable. Signs of Clash Over Rice Loan?

The U.S.-based International Society for Iranian Studies has urged Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to release jailed scholars Haleh Esfandiari and Kian Tajbakhsh. It also expresses concerns about possible torture of the scholars by their Iranian jailers to force them to make confessions. Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the International Federation of Human Rights, Reporters Without Borders, and Iranian Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi also are calling on Tehran to release the scholars immediately. Those groups also are urging Tehran to lift travel bans on two journalists with dual-citizenship -- Parnaz Azima, a U.S.-Iranian correspondent for U.S.-government funded Radio Farda,Â  and Mehrnoush Solouki, a French-Iranian journalism student. Ebadi, whose work for democracy and women and children's rights made her the first-ever Iranian recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, accused Iran's judiciary of "denying dual-nationals their basic rights" and disregarding "Iran's laws as well as international norms." Ebadi and her Defenders of Human Rights Center are working on behalf of two of the defendants. The groups also are seeking information about Ali Shakeri, an Iranian-American peace activist who went missing during a visit to Iran. The groups say Shakeri is thought to have been jailed by Iranian authorities. All of the groups accuse Tehran of trying to spread fear among journalists, writers, scholars, and activists. Iran: Concern Grows For Detained Iranian-Americans Washington Rejects Iranian Allegations Of Spying Iran Announces Charges Against Three U.S.-Iranian Nationals Iran Says U.S. Must Change Policy In Iraq Bush Calls For Tougher Sanctions On Iran U.S.-Iranian Talks In Baghdad Some perspectives on the U.S.-Iranian talks of May 28, 2007, as expressed to Radio Farda. Mehrdad Khansari, a former Iranian diplomat and analyst who is based in London: "Today the talks with the U.S. have begun but that does not mean that the talks will have reached a result. The Iranian and U.S. governments need to [tell] their audiences that they are not abstaining from talking to each other." Tehran-based journalist Mashaollah Shamsolvaezin (pictured above): "There is a necessity that has forced the two countries to accept a series of new issues; these new issues are the talks that are going to begin between the two sides and I am hopeful about its future. The U.S. is facing serious [problems] regarding the situation in Iraq, from the other side is Iran facing some threats in the Middle East that come from insecurity in Iraq and also insecurity in Afghanistan. The seriousness of talks depend on the will of both sides and it seems that both sides are determined to seriously deal with issues, therefore I see a positive perspective for the Iran/U.S.talks." Ted Galen Carpenter, a U.S. foreign policy analyst at the Cato Institute in Washington (pictured above), says he believesÂ the talksÂ can help: "The United States is in a difficult position right now in that the current U.S policy in Iraq simply has not worked at all; and I think we are beginning to cast about for some alternatives and Iran can be at least modestly hopeful in that regard as long as we recognize that Iranian influence in Iraq is going to be inevitably much, much stronger than it was before." Richard Perle, a former Pentagon official (pictured above) who lobbied forcefully for a U.S. invasion of Iraq: "I don't believe [talking to Iran will] help because I don't believe there is any interest on the part of the mullahs in Tehran in changing the behavior of the government of Iran, which has been -- and I think will continue to be -- to encourage violence and disorder in Iraq."

At table is IWC chair Bill Hogarth. (AP Photo/Michael Dinneen) ANCHORAGE, Alaska - Japan said Wednesday that the International Whaling Commission should allow four of its coastal communities to hunt minke whales because the tradition is so old that it qualifies as subsistence hunting. Japan's proposal at the annual meeting of the 77-nation commission started a long and contentious debate Wednesday, a day after the body allowed Alaska Natives to continue the subsistence hunts of bowhead whales through 2012. The issue is scheduled to be decided Thursday, the final day of the meeting. Joji Morishita, the alternate IWC commissioner for Japan, told delegates that the Japanese communities "have been living on this tradition for hundreds of years; it is part of their lives." Morishita said science cannot draw the line between small coastal whaling and aboriginal whaling. Japan for more than two decades has sought "community whaling" status, which would give it quotas similar to those allowing Alaska Natives and other indigenous groups to hunt the mammals. Japan already kills about a 1,000 whales a year and sells the meat under a scientific research provision allowed by the whaling commission, which enacted a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. The proposal was heard a day after the whaling commission allowed Alaska Natives to continue the subsistence hunts of bowhead whales through 2012. Morishita acknowledged Wednesday that if Japan's request is approved, some meat from the minke whales, a relatively small species, would be sold. "What's wrong with commerciality?" he said. "Even the media here is commercial. Why do people have to see only commercial whaling as evil?" Russia supports the proposal, with its delegation saying Japan's traditional whaling is likely twice as old as Arctic whaling. That contention is misleading, said Atsushi Ishii, an environmental studies professor at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan. Of the four communities, he said, only Taiji on the southeastern coast has a tradition of hunting right whales , now under the commission moratorium , dating back more than 100 years. Only later, around the World War II era, did the other three begin hunting species now banned, he said. However, a number of nations voiced strong opposition. New Zealand said the minke proposal is the type of commercial whaling banned by the 1986 ban. The U.S. delegation noted that 360 minke whales are already caught annually in the Sea of Japan and the North Pacific. Of that, 220 are for Japan's scientific research program and 140 are bycatch. Both the United States and New Zealand also have expressed outrage at Japan's plan to kill 50 humpback whales, an endangered species, as part of its science program. The two were among nations to successfully pass a symbolic resolution Wednesday calling for Japan to suspend all lethal aspects of the program conducted within the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, an area around Antarctica where commercial whaling is banned. Also Wednesday, Greenland failed to win consensus on a revised proposal to increase its aboriginal quota of minke whales. Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory, originally wanted to add bowhead and humpback whales to its hunt for the first time. Critics said the giant mammals have low reproduction cycles and should not be treated as menu items.

The Quartet, which includes Russia, the United States, the United Nations and the EU, urged an end to fighting Wednesday between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, calling on the Palestinian government to do everything necessary to restore law and order. The group, which met in Berlin, also urged all Palestinians to immediately renounce all acts of violence and respect the cease-fire. Alaa el-Hadidy, a spokesman for Egypt's foreign ministry, described the Quartet's statement Thursday as unbalanced. "This is tantamount to giving a green light to Israel to continue its operations in the Palestinian territories," el-Hadidy said in a statement. "The credibility of the Quartet, as a neutral side, is now at stake." A five-month truce in Gaza unraveled earlier this month when Hamas began firing barrages of rockets into southern Israel, prompting Israel to respond with a series of air strikes. More than 50 Palestinians, most of them militants, and two Israeli civilians have been killed. The four countries also called for the release of British Broadcasting Corp. journalist Alan Johnston, who was kidnapped in Gaza on March 12. "How come the Quartet demands the immediate release of an Israeli soldier and does not condemn the kidnapping of the Palestinian lawmakers?" el-Hadidy said. Israel has arrested dozens of senior Hamas officials, including lawmakers and government ministers, as part of the recent crackdown. The group has seen renewed activity in recent months, though violence has continued. They plan to meet again in June, this time with Arab representatives in the Middle East.

Nato troop casualties as Taleban claims it shot down helicopter Michael Evans, Defence Editor A Chinook helicopter from the Nato-led force in Afghanistan crashed yesterday, killing seven people on board, five of them Americans. The Taleban claimed that it had shot down the aircraft in Helmand, the southern Afghanistan province patrolled by British and other Nato forces. A Nato statement said: &ldquo;The entire crew of five died in the incident. There were also two military passengers who died.&rdquo; A US official said that five American troops had died on board the helicopter, which he said had probably been brought down by a rocket-propelled grenade. The two passengers were not Americans. Yousuf Ahmadi, a spokesman for the Taleban, said that &ldquo;our Taleban brothers&rdquo; had shot down the Chinook in Helmand&rsquo;s Kajaki district. &ldquo;The helicopter burst into flames in the sky and then crashed. It seems that no one on board could have survived. The foreign troops have cordoned the area so we cannot have access to the area to determine the number of casualties.&rdquo; SBS behind Taliban leader&rsquo;s death Afghans blame Nato for civilian deaths Nato said that troops arriving at the scene had also come under fire, forcing them to call in airstrikes to &ldquo;eliminate the enemy threat&rdquo;. The Taleban have previously claimed to have shot down foreign military aircraft but such accounts have mostly been denied. The international forces have, however, lost several aircraft to accidents or technical failures. The Taleban&rsquo;s apparent success in downing a Chinook will ring alarm bells throughout the Nato force in Afghanistan. The British force in Helmand relies on Chinooks for transporting troops and supplies and evacuating casualties. The RAF has seven Chinooks in southern Afghanistan in constant use. Chinooks are sturdy and have a good safety record, but yesterday&rsquo;s crash has underlined the hazards faced by all helicopter crews. Rocket-propelled grenades do not have a long range but can still be deadly against helicopters flying at low altitude. More worryingly, there is evidence that the Taleban have acquired shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles from Iran, which have a range of more than a mile. Helicopters are key to all operations in southern Afghanistan because of the large expanse of territory and the comparatively few troops available to defend isolated towns and villages. British troops are based in the north of Helmand province, in the Sangin Valley, and also in the south around the town of Garmsir, where the Taleban have a stronghold. Chinooks fly daily missions to these isolated areas, dropping off ammunition, food and water for the troops. All helicopters and the Hercules transport aircraft, which also play a crucial role in Afghanistan, are vulnerable to ground fire, and crews are aware that even a burst of small arms fire can bring them down if bullets pierce the fuel tanks. Two years ago the Taleban used a rocket-propelled grenade to shoot down a US Chinook in Kunar, killing all 16 soldiers on board. Heli-borne supply and combat-support are indeed the cornerstone of most successful operations in mountainous areas and it ususally the arrival of effect surface-air weaponry that tips the balance. I can imagine there are a few old Soviet Generals and retired veterens smugly observing the great 'alliance' dashing itself on the rocks of Afghanistan. That region never been subdued by an invader, whether by hearts-and-minds or scorched-earth, so you have to wonder what the US-led forces there are going to do to change this batting-record. Or shall they struggle and bleed for 10 years and then shabbily retreat like all the rest?

Monday, May 28, 2007 (Baghdad) The United States and Iran will open their first substantial talks in 27 years in Baghdad, with both countries setting modest goals and limiting discussions to ways to quell the chaos in Iraq. America is likely to present claims that Iran has been providing support to Iraqi militia responsible for the spiralling violence in Iraq. Iran on the other hand is likely to stress on having uncovered spy rings organised by the United States and its Western allies, and call for an early troop withdrawal from Iraq. The meet is the first since both the countries broke off relations in 1979, following the fall of the Shah regime. Though only Iraq is on the agenda, a breakthrough is highly unlikely on any matter, especially since Iran now is under UN as well as US sanctions because of its nuclear policy.

NG and RAPHAEL WONG PUTRAJAYA: The Federal Court, in a majority decision, has rejected Lina Joy's appeal to compel the National Registration Department (NRD) to remove the word Islam from her identity card. The 42-year-old will now have to either subject herself to the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court on whether she is an apostate or seek a review of the Federal Court decision. Chief Justice Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim ruled that the NRD had reasonably imposed a condition requiring Lina to obtain a certificate of apostasy from the Syariah Court before it proceeds to make the deletion. The second most senior judge on the Bench, Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Justice Richard Malanjum, however, handed down a dissenting judgment criticising the NRD’s act as “unconstitutional and discriminatory”. The third judge on the panel, Federal Court judge Justice Alauddin Mohd Sheriff, concurred with the Chief Justice in dismissing Lina’s appeal. Approached after the judgment, Lina’s lawyer Benjamin Dawson said he was considering filing for a review of the judgment.

');" onmouseout="hideMenu();"> Asia - Pacific ');" onmouseout="hideMenu();"> Middle East ');" onmouseout="hideMenu();"> Asia - Pacific ');" onmouseout="hideMenu();"> Middle East Venezuela: the RCTV case - is democracy threatened? Even though it had been widely announced, first of all by the rumours of the political world and then by the Miraflores Palace itself, the closure of RCTV (Radio Caracas Television) has given rise to a further polarisation of an already divided Venezuelan population. The TV broadcaster&#039;s supporters, who had already manifested publicly, have fought with the police and 11 police officers have been injured. Some deem the decision to close the popular network as a further sign of the authoritarian aims of Hugo Chavez, while others consider it as the right sanction for a TV that had supported the 2002 coup. At 11:59:59 pm on Sunday May 27th RCTV went off air for the first time in 53 years. The channel was founded on 15th November 1953 and it is universally considered, both by its supporters and detractors, the "mother" of all the national broadcasters and a sort of historical memory of contemporary Venezuelan culture. However, in 20 minutes alone, it was replaced by the newborn public broadcaster, TVes (Venezuelan Social Television) that the government presented as the new frontier in media communication. The closing of RCTV didn&#039;t come out of the blue: months ago, while the expiry date for the Government&#039;s decisions on frequency allocations was approaching, Hugo Chavez announced that the popular channel would not continue broadcasting. During the last few months the disputes over the decision have gradually worsened and resulted in demonstrations held before and after the closure of the channel, demonstrations during which 11 police officers were injured. The dynamics are being investigated by the Judiciary which will have to identify who began the fight, the demonstrators or the Police. According to the explanations of Juan Romero, chief of the Metropolitan Police, some particularly violent indivduals charged the police cordon in an attempt to force their way through and enter the headquarters of the Conatel (National Telecommunications Council). The latter responded by firing tear gas and using water canons but without being able, at the beginning, to halt the demonstration which was brought to an end only hours later when, always according to Romero, some shots were fired at the police. The military claim such a high level of tension was created in order to have "a dead body the Government could be blamed for". Even though such an explosion of violence from the population hadn&#039;t been seen since 2002, the central issue remains the decision of the criticised President Chavez to force the oldest, most popular Venezuelan channel off the air; such a decision offers an important base on which to review the status of the freedom of expression in the Bolivarian Republic. The first voices raised in protest against the decisions of the Miraflores Palace were obviously those of RCTV. The CEO claimed that this "marks a turn towards totalitarianism" and re-confirmed the dual decisions of the management body: starting from that moment to continue broadcasting at least three newscast per day through channels offered by supportive broadcasters and through the Web and, then, taking legal action in the national court and in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. RCTV will present the Commission, where it is likely the Organisation of American States (OAS) will also appeal for the same reasons, the accusations according to which the closure was decided on, the channel had been opposed to the executive throughout the years; such an attitude would thus bring a sort of "censura ad libitum". As concerns the Venezuelan Court, it will have to decide whether article 210 of the 2002 Telecommunication law has been violated; according to the law the renewal of frequencies allocation should automatically be granted up to 2027 or at least up to 2022. The polls by Datanalisi confirmed that dissatisfaction cuts across the civil society too: more than 70% of the interviewees declared they are against the Government&#039;s choice while only 13% said they were favourable. Gonzalo Marroquin, president of SIP (Inter-American Press Association) refers to the Chapultepec Treaty according to which neither the media nor their frequencies shall be used to earn benefits or to punish opponents. Teodoro Petkoff, founder of MAS (Movement to Socialism) advanced the issue talking about "a further step towards a media dictatorship". The issue quickly surpassed the national borders and found a wide echo abroad: the European Union expressed its serious concern and reiterated its request that Venezuela respect the fundamental rights and the freedom of expression. The Peruvian President, Alan Garcia, and the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, immediately denounced the event while the ASDER (Salvadorian Broadcasters&#039; Association) suspended, as a sign of solidarity, its broadcast for 5 minutes on May 28th; the same protest took place in Costa Rica on the same day. The Colombian trade unionists also shared the view that Chavez&#039;s decision is the umpteenth symptom of its authoritarianism; the White House may follow this view since it has already accused the Head of State in Caracas of having infringed the laws concerning the freedom of thought and of expression. However not all the national and international communities are lined up against Chavez. Several manifestations supporting his decision have taken place in front of the Venezuelan embassies in Costa Rica, El Salvador and Mexico and resulted also in some fights with RCTV supporters. In Venezuela too the outcome of the debate has not been decided yet, despite the findings of the sociological survey institutes. First of all Chavez&#039;s approval rating remains high and does not fall under 65%, the figure which had assured his victory at the Presidential elections. Secondly, there are indeed two theories that endorse the decision to close the TV channel. First of all some of the Head of State&#039;s supporters quote the Constitution itself where it is clearly stated that the renewal of the allocations is never automatic and the Government has, according to the so-called Primary Law, the right/duty to deliberate on the use of the national radio and television network. Moreover, the Executive can, among its other competences, create a public television that is currently meant to be TVes. According to this point of view, Miraflores Palace did not infringe any fundamental law, let alone decrease the importance of private channels which would have simply been downsized in order to allow a more equal distribution of frequencies. In fact, according to the Media Watch Global, before RCTV was closed, 79 (97%) out of 81 TV channels were private and the situation was similar for the radios (706 private out of 709). So, if any political connotation were excluded, the issue would only consist in the implementation of the national constitutional laws. The second theory is that of "Self-Defence", whose supporters ideally line up with Modesto Emilio Guerrero. Their theory bases itself on the explanation given by Chavez himself on May 25th according to which if Globovision, RCTV, Televen and Venevision remained in the hands of the oligarchy, they would threaten the government, the revolution and democracy. By exploiting false information and funding terrorism (the way in which funds were granted has not been clearly specified), RCTV would have thus repeatedly tried, from 2002 up to today, to destabilise the State thus deliberately ignoring the social responsibility the media have. In this optic, the President&#039;s decision would be no more than an action made to protect national stability and, partially, to restore moral values. In order to justify the closure of RCTV in fact, Caracas also brought up two events that had been forgotten: during Andrea Peres&#039; mandate the TV had been involved in two scandals: tax evasion and broadcast of pornographic images. It is not rare, indeed it is common, for the government of a nation to deliberate on the assignment of frequencies needed for radio and TV broadcasting. The clamour the RCTV case rose was not related to the action itself but rather to the meaning such an action might have in the near future. It had been ascertained long ago that Chavez wished to "hush up" the inconvenient channel that, according to him, was guilty of having supported the 2002 coup. Such an accusation comes from the fact that during the fights no images of the Head of State&#039;s supporters had been shown not even when they had been charged by their opponents. No negotiations and no legal remedy convinced Chavez to give up his aim; the High Court too was not of help given its ambiguous attitude: even though it had not deliberated yet on Garnier&#039;s appeals it did not hesitate in assigning the frequencies to the new TVes, thus tacitly supporting the projects of the executive and sustaining the suspicion the Bolivarian Revolution invalidated the Judiciary&#039;s impartiality. Rumours according to which Globovision, Venevision and Televen too are being targeted by the President cast a shadow on the general situation of the press and freedom of expression under Chavez. Even though we examine the situation through the lenses of the "self-defence" supporters, the reaction appears at least too drastic. Even though media undoubtedly have an important weight in contemporary politics, it is difficult to suppose a TV channel might turn the roots of a country upside down. Without prejudice to the fact that the legitimacy of the TV closure has not been ascertained yet and even though we admitted that the Constitution might endorse this decision, the refusal to assign frequencies has a considerable importance since it seems to lay bare some of the national management&#039;s weaknesses. Either the willingness of the President, now publicly revealed, to constantly monitor information, or its excessive fear the latter might jeopardise its position. Equally, the recent events have underlined, for the first time since 2004, that the society, even its pro-Chavist part, does not accept as a dogma any order whatsoever imposed by the Head of the State even though, according to the polls, it still holds trust in its leader. The risk of the society&#039;s polarisation seems to be very likely, as is an isolation on the international scene, if we consider the aggressive affirmations Miraflores addressed to the world community as a response to the criticism received: as the official press releases state, such criticism is considered by Venezuelan Government as a violation of the international treaties and meddling in Venezuela&#039;s internal decisions. If it is not meant to be a mere act of force against the opposition, the RCTV issue should represent for the Government of Caracas an occasion to deeply reflect on its future actions in order to avoid the explosion of national and international conflicts and a likely (and probably ruinous) fall into authoritarianism.

Japan will submit its proposal for what it calls aboriginal whaling to the 77-member IWC again today, the last day of the commission&#39;s annual meeting in Alaska, Anchorage, after consulting members overnight, Morishita said yesterday. ``We have been waiting for 20 years for this commission to approve this,&#39;&#39; he said. Japan&#39;s government, which kills the most whales in the world through what it calls a scientific research program, argues its coastal whaling proposal is no different from hunting by Eskimos and other indigenous groups that received unanimous support this week from the IWC. Japan has threatened to leave the commission should it fail to get the measure approved. The proposal is ``a novel category of commercial whaling,&#39;&#39; Chris Carter, New Zealand&#39;s Conservation Minister and a critic of Japan&#39;s research whaling, said. ``This proposal doesn&#39;t meet the definition of subsistence&#39;&#39; because Japan wants to sell the meat in local markets, he said. Anti-whaling nations won a non-binding resolution yesterday proposed by New Zealand calling on Japan to end its scientific whaling in the Southern Ocean Sanctuary by a margin of vote 40 to 2. Japan and most pro-whaling nations boycotted the motion and there was one abstention. Japan, which plans to kill 1,325 whales next year on research expeditions, wants the IWC to allow the towns of Taiji, Wada and Ayukawa on the main island of Honshu and Abashiri on Hokkaido, to kill minke whales. Japan already kills 220 minke from the stock in the Okhotsk Sea-East Pacific region which is adjacent to the towns it nominated. These are killed as part of the research hunts. Meat from all the whales killed by Japan is sold throughout the country and called ``research by-product.&#39;&#39; The IWC, which holds a United Nations mandate to conserve global whale stocks, voted unanimously on May 28 for the renewal of several aboriginal whaling quotas, including one for Eskimos in Alaska and Russia that allows them to hunt 280 bowhead whales during the next five years. Pro-whaling countries, including several African and Caribbean nations, support Japan&#39;s coastal whaling plan. ``Japan&#39;s proposal appears no different than Alaska&#39;s bowhead whaling,&#39;&#39; said Gregory Bowen, Grenada&#39;s IWC commissioner. ``The only difference is that one is called small- coastal hunting and other is called aboriginal whaling.&#39;&#39; Opposition to Japan&#39;s proposal stems in part from the research hunts, which it began a year after the commission banned commercial whaling in 1986. Japan says the program is necessary to prove whale stocks have recovered sufficiently to sustain a return to commercial whaling. This year it cut short its Southern hunt after the main ship caught fire. Japan has also angered anti-whaling nations with its plan to add humpbacks, an endangered species, to the minke and fin whales it kills on expeditions to the Southern Ocean Sanctuary in Antarctica.

As journalists looked on Wednesday, a judge who mediated in the dispute escorted the four Chevron Corp subcontractors taken May 9 to the governor&#039;s offices in southern Rivers State where they were handed over to authorities. U.S. embassy officials were not immediately available for comment. Elsewhere, protesters besieged a major pipeline control center feeding a Royal Dutch Shell PLC oil export terminal in Nigeria, forcing the company to suspend exports of 150,000 barrels of crude oil a day, a company official said Wednesday. Protesters from K-Dere in the Ogoni district of Nigeria&#039;s southern oil region invaded the company&#039;s Bomu Manifold on Monday, tampering with some pipeline equipment and forcing the shutdown of the facility, Shell spokesman Precious Okolobo said.

It was the second disruption of crude supply on the pipeline, which sends crude from onshore facilities around the oil industry center of Port Harcourt to Shell&#039;s Bonny oil export terminal. Growing lawlessness, including armed attacks, in the oil-rich southern Niger Delta that accounts for nearly all of Nigeria&#039;s oil have cut about a quarter of the normal exports of Africa&#039;s leading oil producer. Most inhabitants of the impoverished region of swamps, creeks and mangrove forests feel cheated out of the oil produced on their land and want an increased share of oil revenue. Some 200 foreign workers have been kidnapped &#8212; most quickly released for ransom &#8212; since armed militants stepped up their attacks against the oil companies and government in late 2005. Some 20 foreign hostages remain in captivity. President Umaru Yar&#039;Adua used his inaugural address Tuesday to appeal for an immediate end to violence in Nigeria&#039;s oil heartland, and the largest militant group said it would consider the overture.

Putin has issued an acerbic warning to the United States, saying the recent test of a new Russian missile was a direct response to US actions and condemning "imperialism" in world affairs. President Vladimir Putin issued an acerbic warning Friday to the United States, saying the recent test of a new Russian missile was a direct response to US actions and condemning "imperialism" in world affairs. "Our American partners have quit the ABM Treaty," Putin told reporters after meeting his Greek counterpart, referring to the landmark 1972 US-Soviet treaty limiting the missile defenses of the Cold War superpower foes. "We warned them then that we would come out with a response to maintain the strategic balance in the world. Yesterday we conducted a test of a new strategic ballistic missile with multiple warheads, and of a new cruise missile, and will continue to improve our resources." The United States informed Russia in 2001 that it was exercising its option to withdraw unilaterally from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) pact. It has since stepped up controversial plans, fiercely opposed by Russia, to deploy a missile defence shield in eastern Europe. Putin warned Wednesday that the US missile defense plan would turn Europe into a "powder keg" and he repeated on Thursday previous assertions that the planned deployments would ignite a new Cold War-style arms buildup. "We are not the initiators of this new round of the arms race," Putin said. The Russian president's comments came a week before he meets US President George W. Bush and other leaders of the Group of Eight (G8) industrialised nations at a summit in Germany. He is also scheduled to hold one-on-one talks with Bush in the United States at the beginning of July. In a thinly disguised attack on US foreign policy in recent years, Putin warned there had been attempts by actors -- he did not name any country or bloc explicitly -- in international affairs to impose their will on others. "In our view, it is nothing other than diktat, than imperialism," the Russian leader stated. "Problems have arisen because the world changed and there was an attempt to make it unipolar. There was a desire among several international actors to dictate their will to each and everyone and to act not in accordance with the norms of international life and law," Putin said. He added: "This is very dangerous and unhealthy. The norms of international law have been altered for political expediency. What is this political expediency and who defines it?" Tensions between Russia and the United States have risen dramatically in the past year amid sharpening differences over the US missile plans, the state of democracy in Russia and concerns over energy supplies. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice repeated on Wednesday the US assertion that the planned missile defense system in eastern Europe poses no threat to Russia and that Moscow's concern over it is "ludicrous." Her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, countered at a meeting of G8 foreign ministers outside Berlin that "there is nothing ludicrous about this issue because the arms race is starting again."

In response, Histadrut Chairman Ofer Eini sent a letter to the UNISON chairman to try and avert the potentially harmful vote, scheduled for mid-June. "Despite the aggression of the Palestinians, it never occurred to me to impose a boycott on Palestinian workers or employers," Eini wrote. "The boycott against Israel will only cause the situation to deteriorate further." Eini noted with concern that if the boycott was passed, UK pension funds would stop investing in Israel and UNISON's 1.6 million members would themselves boycott Israeli goods. Harris: Another British union falls on its head Envoy: Academic boycott not UK policy Earlier this week, Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) President Willie Madisha said COSATU supported a campaign of boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel. Madisha was speaking at a news conference in which South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress, urged South Africans to turn out in their thousands during next week's national protest action in solidarity with the Palestinians. The COSATU president said action against Israel "must be sustained for as long as possible beyond the week we have identified. COSATU will campaign among organizations of the working class around the world to support this call." Meanwhile, British Minister for Higher Education Bill Rammell slammed the UCU decision to urge its members to consider the "moral implications" of links with Israeli academic institutions, saying that the British government supported academic freedom and opposed any boycott of Israel. He said such a decision would do nothing to advance peace in the Middle East. "The UK government fully supports academic freedom and is firmly against any academic boycotts of Israel or Israeli academics," said Rammell. "Whilst I appreciate the independence of the UCU, I am very disappointed that the union has decided to pass a motion which encourages its members to consider boycotting Israeli academics and education institutions. I profoundly believe this does nothing to promote the Middle East peace process," continued the British minister. Also Thursday, the Enough! Coalition, of which UNISON is a member, announced that it had scheduled a demonstration in London for June 9 to protest Israel's military presence in the Palestinian territories. The event is being promoted under the slogan: Enough! End the Israeli Occupation, and is being organized with the help of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. On Wednesday, the UCU passed a motion which condemned Israel for its "denial of educational rights" to the Palestinian people and called for UCU branches to discuss an academic boycott of Israel over the next year. The vote has received condemnation from public officials in Israel and abroad. Jerusalem Post | T A L K B A C K | Jerusalem Post 8. Question for UK readers of JPost F.

Erdogan on Tuesday said the United States and Iraq should destroy bases of separatist Kurdish guerrillas in northern Iraq. Prime Minister Erdogan told private NTV television in an interview that Turkey was expecting the United States and Iraq to destroy bases of Kurdish guerrillas in northern Iraq. Erdogan did not rule out a cross-border Turkish operation against the rebels. (AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici) ANKARA, Turkey - Turkey has sent large contingents of reinforcement soldiers, tanks and armored personnel carriers to its border with Iraq as debate heated up over whether to stage a cross-border offensive to hit Kurdish rebel bases. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday urged the United States and Iraq to destroy bases of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, in northern Iraq as Turkish military deployed more tanks and soldiers on the border. The images of military trucks rumbling along the remote border with Iraq's Kurdish zone and tanks being transferred on trains and trucks to beef up an already formidable force there have occupied television screens and front pages of several newspapers in the last few weeks. The Turkish military has said it routinely reinforces the border with Iraq in the summer to prevent infiltrations by the guerrillas. "The PKK must be eliminated as a problem between Iraq and Turkey," Turkey's special envoy to Iraq, Oguz Celikkol, told CNN-Turk television on Wednesday before a visit to Iraq to discuss Turkish demands that Iraq and U.S. forces crack down on the group. Asked whether Turkey could take unilateral action, Celikkol said: "Our expectation is that this issue is resolved before it comes to that point." Erdogan said a cross-border Turkish operation was not off the table. "The target is to achieve results. Our patience has run out. The necessary steps will be taken when needed," Erdogan said. Past cross-border operations have yielded mixed results, with many guerrillas sheltering in hide-outs and emerging to do battle again once the bulk of Turkish units withdrew from Iraq. The Turkish military says up to 3,800 rebels are now based across the border in Iraq and that up to 2,300 operate inside Turkey. Iraqi Kurdish groups have threatened to resist a Turkish incursion. If U.S. forces , who are stretched thin across Iraq , take action, they risk alienating Iraqi Kurds, the most pro-American group in the region. If they don't, they risk increased tensions , and possibly worse , with two powerful rivals. "Our expectation from the United States and Iraq is to scatter and destroy the bases of the terrorist organization in northern Iraq," Erdogan said Tuesday. "They either turn them over or send them elsewhere. We have to achieve results." Last week, a suicide bomb blamed on the rebels killed six people in Ankara, and a bomb in a southeastern area where guerrillas are active killed six Turkish soldiers. Another soldier died on Wednesday when he stepped on a mine, believed to be planted by the guerrillas near the Iraqi border. "All the explosives used by the PKK in Turkey are traced back to Iraq," Celikkol said. Turkish troops say they have killed 10 guerrillas in the country's southeast since Monday. Ankara has repeatedly expressed its disappointment with Washington for what it says is a failure to crack down on Kurdish rebels who take refuge in northern Iraq and frequently attack soldiers and government targets in Turkey. The conflict has killed tens of thousands since the rebels took up arms in 1984.

Now, after eight years as President Hugo Chavez's deputy, Rangel is back on television, interviewing and breaking news on "Jose Vicente Today." But instead of airing the bare-knuckles journalism for which he was once known, Rangel's program on privately owned Televen is decidedly supportive of many of Chavez's policies. Rangel has even defended Chavez's decision not to renew the license of an influential and stridently anti-government television station, RCTV, which went off the air Sunday. "It's up to the state to renew or not renew," said Rangel, 77, who was vice president until January. "This is not an issue of freedom of expression. The issue is the sovereignty of the state." Among Venezuelan broadcasters, Rangel is not alone in his support of the president's move, even though it has been condemned by international press freedom groups. The reason, government critics say, is clear: Chavez increasingly controls what gets printed and aired, regardless of whether a media outlet is private or public. Buffeted by harsh coverage in its first four years, the government has made amplification of its voice a cornerstone of its communications strategy in the past four years. The new reality is a far cry from 2002, when the biggest papers and television stations supported an opposition movement through a coup and a national strike intended to dislodge Chavez from power. Outlets, particularly television stations, that were once aggressively anti-government have grown docile under threat of sanctions, say press freedom and human rights groups, while the government has used a windfall in oil revenue to start up newspapers and broadcast networks. "In 2002, you had highly critical media, four private television stations and a state media apparatus that was very weak," said Carlos Lauria, an Argentine journalist who led a delegation that studied the RCTV case for the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. "Now, you have a state communications apparatus that is much stronger, with heavy propaganda and media outlets that echo each other." The government has upgraded equipment and expanded the staff of the state station Venezolana de Television, or VTV. It has founded three other TV stations, including Telesur, which broadcasts across Latin America, and about 200 community radio and television stations. It controls or influences dozens of Web sites and, through government advertising, has won backing from established outlets. Telecommunications Minister Jesse Chacon said the idea is to democratize the media, which Chavez officials have complained are in the hands of faceless corporations that care little about social conditions in Venezuela. He said that in 2000, there were virtually no community radio and TV stations. The campaign is crucial, because the government is trying to rapidly transform Venezuela into a socialist state, a path that officials say requires the support of the people. The effort includes all manner of programming, from local homespun talk shows to cultural affairs programs to documentaries -- the kind of programs that even critics of the government say is healthy for a democracy. But critics also see what they call drone-like coverage of the government on the state's main station, VTV. A European Union study of VTV's coverage of December's presidential election found that the vast majority of coverage focused on the government and was overwhelmingly positive. To critics, the most controversial program is "The Razor," a late-night show in which the host, Mario Silva, wears pro-government T-shirts and caps and sits in front of a giant photograph of Fidel Castro and Ernesto "Che" Guevara. He lambastes the opposition and Americans and frequently discloses "news" of counterrevolutionary maneuvers intended to topple Chavez. Two-and-a-half years ago, Venezuela passed a law stipulating that the news media cannot put out reports that endanger national security or incite disruption of public order. The criminal code was also amended so that insulting authorities became a crime. In television broadcasting, only Globovision, a 24-hour cable station seen in the Caracas area, and RCTV have remained hard-charging government opponents. Tough, independent radio stations, such as Union Radio in Caracas, still broadcast. And influential newspapers such as El Universal and El Nacional continue to investigate the government, unraveling stories about bloated bureaucracy and official incompetence. The government says that independence is proof that the state is not trying to censor coverage. This article appeared on page Get up to 50% off home delivery of the Chronicle for 12 weeks!

Best Meals in Asia L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon 15 Queen&rsquo;s Road Central Thaksin’s Party's Over in Thailand The Thai Rak Thai party&rsquo;s dissolution completes the military power grab. It was billed as "Judgment Day" in Bangkok, but Wednesday&#39;s decision by a military-installed court to dissolve ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra&#39;s party and ban its executives from political activity for five years was in the works well before the army seized power last September. The main goal of the coup-makers, of course, was to cut the legs off Thaksin and Thai Rak Thai, the party he founded in 1998 as a personal vehicle to carry him to the premiership. TRT stormed to power with a win in the 2001 general election and became the only party in Thai history to complete a full term in office. The Constitutional Tribunal&#39;s decision to dissolve the party &mdash; finally revealed after the judges read the ruling for an excruciating nine hours &mdash; was just one part of the plan to remove Thaksin from the political scene. The rest of the job belongs to those drafting the new constitution, which aims to limit the powers of the executive and expand the role of non-elected senators and judges to ensure that a reincarnation of Thaksin doesn&#39;t rise from the ashes. While Thaksin can justly be blamed for interfering with independent constitutional bodies during his tenure, the rulers that replaced him have gone even further by overthrowing an elected government, manipulating the justice system, rewriting the constitution, sending soldiers to television stations and enforcing ex post facto laws. Now they&#39;ve wiped Thaksin&#39;s party off the map and banned 111 of the Party&rsquo;s executive members from running in an election for five years &mdash; the harshest possible punishment. Although the blatantly political decision has profound ramifications for the Thai political landscape, it was simply the culmination of a series of rulings over the past year that skirted or completely ignored the law. The opening for Thaksin&#39;s opponents came in February 2006, when the embattled premier called a snap election in response to massive street protests that flared up after his family netted 73.3 billion baht ($2.1 billion today) in the largely tax-free sale of Thailand&#39;s largest telecommunications firm to Singapore&rsquo;s Temasek Holdings. Opposition parties then stunned the Thai political world by announcing a boycott of the election scheduled for April 2, 2006. As coup rumors swirled, the ensuing election failed to produce a quorum, leading to a crisis since the constitution said the Parliament must be opened with 500 members 30 days after the election. By-elections were quickly organized, and just when it looked as if Thai Rak Thai would open Parliament with more than 90% of the seats, King Bhumibol Adulyadej stepped in. On April 25, 2006, the widely respected monarch told the country&#39;s top judges to "solve the problem" &mdash; even saying they should resign if they couldn&#39;t take action. The results were immediate. The heads of the country&#39;s top three courts, fiercely loyal to the king, met outside the courtroom to agree on how to proceed with this unprecedented intervention into political life. The Administrative Court, which had previously been one of the only courts to display its independence, reversed itself halted the by-elections that would&#39;ve most likely have given Thai Rak Thai enough seats to form a government. A few weeks later the Constitutional Court voided the election altogether. The judges then made an extrajudicial call for the election commissioners to resign. The commissioners refused, correctly claiming that the 1997 Constitution gave the judges no power to remove them. So the judges began playing hardball, and the Criminal Court accepted a case from a Democrat party member to try the commissioners for "malfeasance." As it became clear that the election commissioners would soon be hung out to dry, they forwarded two fraud cases to the attorney general. One accused Thai Rak Thai of paying off small parties to field candidates in constituencies where only one candidate was running, which would ensure the election produced a quorum so the party could open Parliament before the 30-day deadline expired. The other accused Democrat party members of paying off small parties to frame Thai Rak Thai for election fraud. Sure enough, soon after the Criminal Court tossed the "disgraced" election commissioners in jail without bail, effectively stripping them of their positions and ending the political stalemate. A new Election Commission was appointed and this time the Democrats and the other main opposition parties would have to participate, as all their demands had been met. But there was a problem. Thaksin and Thai Rak Thai still looked assured of winning. Sure, the huge majority they won in 2005 would be eroded, but the 16 million votes the party won in the voided April poll, even after months of protests, was still more than double the amount the main opposition Democrat party won in 2005, the last election in which it ran. So the coup had to come because Bangkok&#39;s elite wanted Thaksin out, pure and simple. If the election were allowed to proceed, Thaksin would have a new mandate from the rural poor voters who loved him. With the election less than two months away, on September 19, 2006, royalist factions in the army took out Thaksin by force. In the process, they tossed out the 1997 "People&#39;s Constitution," which called for strong political parties and stable governments, as well as the Constitutional Court, which they saw as pro-Thaksin. Instead, their interim constitution created a new court called the Constitution Tribunal that would be filled with the same obedient judges the king addressed in April, and its main duty would be to rule on the dissolution case against the political parties. With Thai Rak Thai out of office, the junta sought to bury it. On September 30, it issued Announcement 27, which banned political gatherings and gave the Constitution Tribunal authority to dissolve political parties. Crucially, it also said that executive members of dissolved political parties would lose their right to run for office for five years. This essentially amended Article 69 of the 1998 Organic Law on Political Parties, which says that executive members can still run in elections but they can&#39;t form a new party or sit on a party&#39;s executive board. The effect was immediate. In an apparent attempt at a last ditch effort to escape punishment, Thaksin stepped down as party leader the next day, dissolving the executive board. At the same time, one of Thai Rak Thai&#39;s largest factions left the party. It looked as if TRT would need to find a coalition partner if it was going to form the next government. Meanwhile, the country&#39;s new leaders went along badmouthing "evil" politicians. The political parties were completely shut out of the process to draft a new constitution. The junta also launched investigations into cabinet members, and sought to undo or rebrand most of Thai Rak Thai&#39;s policies. When the draft constitution was unveiled in April, the power of elected politicians had decreased significantly. Term limits for prime minister made sure no Thaksin would rise again. The charter called for an appointed Senate, an expanded role for judges and strict guidelines on how the executive can spend money. It also eliminated a rule that prevented lawmakers who switch parties from standing in an election for at least 90 days, ensuring a return to the days when a small group of lawmakers could quickly take down a coalition government. With Thai Rak Thai dissolved, the Bangkok elite succeeded in pushing and his allies from power, more or less permanently. Neither Thaksin nor his partly leaders can participate in an election for five years, a lifetime in politics. Other Thai Rak Thai members can still form a new party, but it will likely be a relatively small player. The next government looks set to be governed by either the Democrat Party, which was absolved of all charges yesterday, or Banharn Silpa-Archa, leader of the slippery Chat Thai party, which always looks to join any government to collect the spoils of power. The real winners, however, are the military, judiciary and royalist elites who saw Thaksin as a threat to their traditional power base. With Thaksin gone, they can safely fade into the background once again and pull the strings from behind the scenes. Thaksin had egged them out into the open, and he paid the price. Although the powers that be were able to eliminate Thaksin, his legacy won&#39;t quickly be erased. Political parties will have to take the interests of poor upcountry voters much more seriously from now on. Moreover, his popularity is &ndash; or at least was &#8209; second only to the king&rsquo;s. In five years, when the ban expires, Thaksin may just well be the most popular politician left standing in the country.

Thank you AsiaSentinel for this article. All medias in Thailand are all distorted. &#03655;I wonder that how can someone call someone else corrupted since there is yet still no proof that it is so, except from what some people or some Thai media had been saying. The coup was made from allegetion of coruption but up until now they cannot proof it. The latest judgement was largely an unfair one, which based on not clearly proven evidence of wrong doing. And I believe that the trial of P.M. Thaksin case shall be an unfair one, as well. Just to proof that the coup leader are righteous. You won't find this in Thai Media : saraburian Great article that sum up the situation very nicely. I never voted for TRT and Thaksin but sympathize with his fate given what he's been working against all along (you-know-who!) &#013;&#010;Five years is a long time but compared with 60 years, it's nothing. Thaksin is corrupt. But as a politician under a lot of constraints we all know, he can be proud of his achievements. When you come back in 5 years time, maybe I'd vote for you. &#013;&#010;Democrat is a disappointing lot. I'm sure if it were under Chuan's stewardship, he wouldn't have gone along that path with the Royalists. His long experience with the mudlings from the palace would have given him a second thoughts, no matter how deperate he was to win over the mighty Thaksin. Judgement does obviously supports the coup. Evil dictatorship. down with Thai aristocrats : TKNS I hate the King and his team (including the judge). They are really selfish and care more about their own interest rather than the country's.

In Berlin, the so-called Quartet of Middle East peace mediators - the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations - held talks on how to overcome the new flare-up in fighting. Ban said he hoped the meeting would help "facilitate the peace process." In a non-binding statement read by US Ambassador to the UN Zalmay Khalilzad, who holds the Security Council's rotating presidency this month, members urged all Palestinian parties to join them in "supporting the call of President Abbas for an immediate end to the violence." They expressed their "grave concern" at the breakdown of the cease-fire in Gaza, welcomed Abbas' efforts for an end to the fighting and expressed appreciation for Egypt's "active support" in this regard. Palestinian UN observer Riad Mansour called the statement "a small step in the right direction" and expressed hope that "we can build on it for a larger involvement" of the council in the situation. Mansour added, however, that he would have preferred a call by the council for a Palestinian-Israeli cease-fire in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, an end to Israeli air strikes and the dispatch of UN observers to monitor the cease-fire. Echoing the UN's statement, foreign ministers for the Group of Eight major industrialized powers meeting in Germany urged the Palestinian leadership to stop fighters from firing rockets into Israel and urged the Israelis to show restraint in their response. Israel's security Cabinet decided Wednesday to continue "attacks and military pressure on terrorist groups, mainly Hamas and Islamic Jihad," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's office said in a statement. "It was emphasized [at the meeting] that Israel is not conducting any negotiations for a cease-fire with the terrorist organizations," the statement said. On Tuesday, Abbas proposed a truce covering the Gaza Strip, and then extending the cease-fire to the occupied West Bank within a month. In an interview with Britain's Guardian newspaper, exiled Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal defended the rocket strikes and warned the conflict might be heading for "an explosion." "The Palestinians are steadfast and there are many ways of resisting according to opportunities and conditions," he said. "Now the international community is trying to undermine Hamas. That will lead to an explosion that will be in the face of the Israeli occupation. The damage will affect the stability of the entire region." Meshaal was apparently referring to crippling Western sanctions imposed on the Palestinian Authority. In Cairo, a Hamas delegation began talks Wednesday with Egyptian intelligence officials on ways to consolidate the truce between Hamas and Abbas' Fatah, officials said. But immediately after arriving in Egypt, top Hamas official Said Siam accused Fatah of balking on a reconciliation agreement signed in Mecca earlier this year under which the two sides formed a national unity government. Siam specifically mentioned Mohammad Dahlan, a powerful Fatah leader in the Gaza strip and a top security adviser to Abbas, of orchestrating the fight against Hamas. Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyya, after talks with Abbas, said Wednesday in Gaza that he hoped the talks in Egypt would "reach real understandings and close the painful door" of Palestinian infighting, and also at the same time "open the door of real power sharing." In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces detained the mayor of a small town near Nablus as part of a crackdown on Hamas politicians. Dozens of Hamas officials have been seized since last week. In the past week it has seized Education Minister Nassereddine al-Shaer and another minister along with more than 30 other Palestinian officials. It detained more than 30 Palestinian legislators last year, mostly from Hamas, after the Islamist group won power in January's parliamentary elections. The speaker of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Poettering, used a speech to the Israeli Parliament on Wednesday to urge Israel to free the Palestinian legislators. "The situation seems critical in a way that it has not for a long time," he said. "The European Parliament calls on the one hand for the release of the abducted Israeli soldiers, Ehud Goldwasser, Eldad Regev [seized by Hizbullah in July 2006] and Gilad Shalit [captured near Gaza by Palestinian militants in June 2006], as well as of the British correspondent Alan Johnston [kidnapped by Palestinian militants on March 12 of this year], and on the other for the imprisoned members of Parliament and other politicians, including Education Minister Nassereddine al-Shaer, to be released," Poettering said. He also called on Israel to release some $700 million of Palestinian customs revenue it has collected but not passed on to the Palestinian government. "This is Palestinian money," he said. "This is not money which belongs to others." But Olmert rejected the call. "The prime minister emphasized that he will not transfer funds to the Palestinian Authority so long as there is concern that the funds will be used for terrorist ends," Olmert's office said in a statement after he held talks with Poettering Earlier, the Israeli Army killed two Hamas members in an air strike in the Gaza Strip. Several civilians were wounded in the attack and a house was damaged, ambulance crews said. - Send to a friend Save to My Web Your feedback is important to us!

The Taliban said 35 people died in the helicopter crash in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan. Hours after the helicopter went down, the Taliban ambushed a police convoy on a main road in southern Zabul province and killed 16 policemen, the interior ministry said. Since the traditional winter lull, the resurgent Taliban have stepped up actions in recent months with a series of suicide attacks, roadside bombs and ambushes against foreign and Afghan forces. In an apparent response to the Chinook crash, a joint NATO and Afghan raid supported by air power killed and wounded dozens of Taliban in Sangin district, close to Kajaki where the twin-rotor NATO helicopter went down on Wednesday night, the Afghan defense ministry said. NATO said the fighting was part of a broader offensive called "Operation Lastay Kulang," from the local Pashto language for "axe handle," meant to extend the Afghan government's control into the north of Helmand province. Officials said 2,000 foreign and Afghan troops, including 1,000 British soldiers and elements of the elite U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, were involved in a push to loosen the Taliban's grip on the Sangin Valley. Helmand, a long-time bastion of the Taliban, is the leading drug-producing region of Afghanistan, the world's main heroin supplier. It has been the scene of a series of bloody fights between Taliban and Western forces in recent months. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

"There will be a full investigation," said Maj. John Thomas, a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force. "We will try to determine everything that happened and to fully investigate the site." A U.S. military official, who insisted on speaking anonymously because the crash was still under investigation, said initial reports suggested the helicopter was hit with a rocket-propelled grenade Wednesday evening. A purported Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, claimed in a phone call to The Associated Press that militants shot the helicopter down in southern Helmand province, the world's largest opium poppy-growing region where combat has been heavy in recent months. Ahmadi did not offer any proof for his claim, but he specified the helicopter crashed in the Kajaki district hours before NATO reported that information. Kajaki is the site of a hydroelectric dam and the scene of recent fighting. NATO said troops going to the crash site were ambushed by enemy fighters and the unit called in an airstrike "to eliminate the enemy threat." It did not say if the troops were from the U.S.-led coalition, NATO's force or the Afghan army. One civilian was injured by gunfire. The CH-47 Chinook, a heavy transport helicopter with two rotors, can carry around 40 soldiers plus a small crew. The fact it was flying at night suggested the aircraft might have been carrying troops on a nighttime air assault. Kajaki is the site of a large U.S.-funded hydroelectric dam now being repaired so it can provide electricity to the southern city of Kandahar. British troops, who make up the bulk of the forces in Helmand province, have been engaged in fierce fighting around the dam protecting it. The NATO force, which is responsible for a countrywide counterinsurgency campaign, has 37,000 soldiers, including about 14,000 Americans. There are 12,000 U.S. troops in the separate U.S.-led coalition, which trains the Afghan army and conducts Special Forces anti-terrorism operations. Helicopter crashes in Afghanistan have been relatively rare. A Chinook crashed in February in the southern province of Zabul, killing eight U.S. personnel. Officials ruled out enemy fire as the cause. In May 2006, another Chinook crashed attempting a nighttime landing on a small mountaintop in eastern Kunar province, killing 10 U.S. soldiers. In 2005, a U.S. helicopter crashed in Kunar, after apparently being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, killing 16 Americans. Elsewhere, a senior military officer said the U.S. had "the Taliban on their heels" in Afghanistan. Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Pentagon reporters that "the Taliban has suffered numerous losses and has suffered losses to their senior leadership over this past month" in southern and eastern Afghanistan. As a result, the Taliban has "reverted to asymmetric-type, small-scale, high-profile attacks," he said. Mullah Dadullah, a one-legged veteran who orchestrated an intensifying campaign of suicide attacks and beheadings, was killed in an operation in southern Afghanistan this month. He had been considered the top Taliban field commander. Still, Wiggins said that as the poppy harvest ends, more insurgents might join the battle. "So the fight's not over," he said. "But we'll continue to take the offensive through several of the operations we have in Afghanistan, and hopefully ... continue to inflict casualties on the Taliban."

As he spoke, thousands of university students rallied in support of the station for a fifth day. Protests will probably continue all week, said Jeyson Gomez, a 23-year-old a medical student. ``We&#39;ll give the last breaths of our lives to be sure Venezuela doesn&#39;t lose its freedoms and democracy doesn&#39;t die,&#39;&#39; Rosales, the governor of Zulia state, told supporters at a news conference in Caracas. The government&#39;s May 27 closure of RCTV, the most-watched network and a critic of the president, has rallied the opposition and sparked international criticism that the government is seeking to control the media and drown out dissent. The five days of disorder across the country mark the longest stretch of anti-Chavez demonstrations since March 2004, when protests demanding a recall referendum left nine dead. Concern that protests will turn violent led investors to sell dollar and bolivar-denominated bonds in the local market and move money out of the country, pushing down the currency in the unregulated market, traders said. The yield on the government&#39;s 6.25 percent dollar bond due in 2017, known as TICC, rose 18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 4.94 percent, the highest since November 17, at 4 p.m. New York time, according to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. ``The country is extremely polarized, the macro-economic environment is very uncertain, and the conditions of legal stability are also very blurry,&#39;&#39; said Carlos Caicedo, head of Latin American analysis at Exclusive Analysis in London. ``The government probably didn&#39;t foresee such a strong popular support for Radio Caracas and the media in general.&#39;&#39; Chavez&#39;s government has financed scores of new community and national media friendly to its agenda, boosting its reach to include seven open television signals, two cable networks, and 28 community TV channels, along with 200 local radio signals, 110 websites, 40 regional and 4 national newspapers, Rosales said today. ``Here is proof of how this government is advancing to an informational and media hegemony in this country,&#39;&#39; said Rosales, one of the country&#39;s two governors, among a total of 23, who aren&#39;t aligned with Chavez&#39;s coalition. About 182 people have been arrested for their role in allegedly violent acts during protests across Venezuela this week, including 107 minors, Justice Minister Pedro Carreno said last night. At least 17 police officers were hurt in clashes with protesters in Caracas. Most suffered only light cuts and one fractured his shin, Metropolitan Police Chief Juan Francisco Romero Figueroa said. Neither Romero nor Carreno released figures on the number of protesters injured. U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on Chavez to reconsider his ``ill-advised decision&#39;&#39; to shut down RCTV, noting the House of Representatives may ask the Organization of American States to ``respond appropriately&#39;&#39; to his move. ``President Chavez should know that efforts to suppress the media will not only ultimately fail, but are also a detriment to one of the pillars of democracy: freedom of expression,&#39;&#39; Pelosi said in a statement released today from Washington. Texas Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee, who visited Caracas in February, seconded that appeal, asking Chavez&#39;s government ``to abide by its commitments under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Inter-American Democratic Charter and to reverse policies that limit freedom of expression.&#39;&#39; Disturbances were reported last night in Caracas&#39;s Chacao municipality, an opposition stronghold. The private news network Globovision aired a home video of clashes on one of Chacao&#39;s main thoroughfares, showing a group of armed men crowded in high-rise vestibule shooting into the street as scattered debris piles burned in the deserted roadway. A second video showed Metropolitan police shooting at a group of people who scaled a fence to take refuge in an office building&#39;s lobby. According to Metropolitan Police Chief Romero, the video is part of a ``media war&#39;&#39; intended to misrepresent events and incite more violence, state media said. ``Why don&#39;t they say they were shooting plastic bullets, permitted by international law for use in disturbances to the public order?&#39;&#39; Romero asked. ``Why don&#39;t they show the videos where police are talking to the students and trying to dissuade them in the first place?&#39;&#39; To contact the reporters on this story: Theresa Bradley in Caracas at ; Guillermo Parra-Bernal in Caracas at Last Updated: May 30, 2007 18:21 EDT Venezuela&#39;s Local Bonds Rebound as Street Protests Against Chavez Ease Colombia Peso Breaks 1,900-Per-Dollar-Barrier on Bank&#39;s Inflation Emphasis Chinese Iron-Ore Demand, Steel Output May Exceed Expectations, Vale Says

Ankara sent more tanks to its border with Iraq this week as part of manoeuvres that have spurred talk of an impending cross-border military operation into northern Iraq to crush Turkish Kurd guerrillas hiding there. "This is spring planning. We can't do it in the winter when temperatures are minus 20-30 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). No new troops have been sent to the region," General Yasar Buyukanit, head of the army General Staff, told reporters. Speculation about an imminent incursion into Iraq has grown since Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said last week he saw eye to eye with the army over possible military action, despite unease in the United States, Turkey's NATO ally, about such a move. Buyukanit said last month a military incursion into northern Iraq was necessary to quash Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants based there. But he stressed on Thursday that the government first needed to make a political decision regarding such an incursion. In Turkey, parliament must authorise military action outside the country's borders. "The political authorities need to decide on this. We can't know whether we will go there and fight only the PKK or deal with (Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud) Barzani as well," he said. The United States has repeatedly urged Turkey not to send troops into Iraq, saying this would only complicate the situation. The two countries have agreed various measures, including financial ones, to try to curb the PKK. But pressure within Turkey for an incursion is growing after a suicide bombing in the capital Ankara last week killed six people and injured scores more. Authorities blamed the attack on the PKK, which denied involvement. More than 30,000 people have died in the conflict with the PKK since the group launched its insurgency in 1984. news is provided by Zoom to full size map Facts & Figures - Landmine casualties (2004) Iraq bomber kills 20, Sunni militants clash FACTBOX-Security developments in Iraq, May 31 May toll for U.S. soldiers in Iraq climbs to 122 IRAQ: Cancer emerges as major cause of death in south FACTBOX-Military and civilian deaths in Iraq Iraqi refugee children begin education programmes Source: WV MEERO - Cyprus Annual report &#8211; ICRC boosts aid in face of growing conflict and displacement Source: ICRC - Switzerland Amputee Cyclist to Circumnavigate The Globe For War Victims Source: Clear Path International - USA WER provides further support to Iraqi people Source: WER - UK Iraq: U.S. response to displacement remains inadequate Source: Refugees International - USA The International Red Cross helps Australian-Palestinians, who were visiting family in the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp, retrieve their belongings in northern Lebanon May 30, 2007.

Thursday, 31st May 2007 Thu 31 May 2007 Warning of security lapses in Iraq as hunt for abducted Britons goes on SECURITY experts warned yesterday of serious lapses in intelligence in Iraq as coalition forces kept up the hunt for the four British bodyguards and one computer expert snatched from Baghdad's finance ministry. Tuesday's daylight raid was carried out by men in police uniforms, and officials said they were no closer to finding out who took them or why. Holes in intelligence gathering in Iraq are said to have opened up since policing and security matters were handed to the Baghdad government, and one source told the BBC the kidnapping would never have happened a year ago. As fears grew for the men's wellbeing, with no demand or even communication from the hostage-takers, Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, insisted the kidnapping would not deter Britain from trying to bring peace to Iraq. Speaking from Freetown, in Sierra Leone, his only remark on the crisis was: "We know the dangers and challenges there [in Iraq] but we shouldn't let those that are prepared to use kidnapping and terror succeed." His reluctance to be drawn further underscores the sensitivity of the situation. Hoshyar Zebari, Iraq's foreign minister, was more forthcoming, blaming the kidnap on the Shia militants, the Mahdi army. "We are pursuing this case very vigorously," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "It has been a known fact for some time that the interior ministry police, security units and forces are corrupt, are penetrated. "This issue is a very serious, challenging fact to the government itself." Mr Zebari pointed to the dozens of people who had confidently sealed off the building, set up roadblocks and broken into the ministry as proof it had been an inside job. He said the kidnappings took place in a Shia-dominated area and could have been conducted by the Mahdi army, led by the Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. But he gave an upbeat assessment of the outcome. "Their safety is our top priority...I don't think they will finish them," he said. "They are using them for bargaining, but they have not contacted anybody yet." However, Abdul Mahdi al-Mutiri, a top official in Sadr's political movement, denied responsibility and insisted the scale and organisation of Tuesday's operation would have been beyond the Mahdi army's capabilities. Separate reports claimed the kidnap group was a Shia-backed death squad not linked to the Mahdi army. On the streets of Sadr City, Baghdad's Shia suburb, United States and Iraqi soldiers scoured homes for the five Britons. But locals raised concerns about their heavy-handed tactics, with residents reporting the demolition of walls by armoured vehicles crashing through their homes. "They started beating us and telling us to bring out the Britons. We said we didn't have them, but they tied our hands outside and put the women together in one room," said Abu Ali, one of the poverty-stricken Sadr City residents. Police said the raids sparked fighting in which two people had died. The US military said it could not confirm its soldiers' involvement in the search. The British computer expert was seized from a room next to a training centre at the ministry, with bodyguards posted outside. A government employee who witnessed the kidnappings told how two other westerners had narrowly escaped being abducted by the gunmen. One lecturer, believed to be an Irish national, avoided capture after leaving the room to fetch some material only moments before the gunmen entered. A second witness, an Iraqi guard, said the leader of the gunmen was a man in a police major's uniform who spoke in fluent English to the hostages. While Iraqi government officials suggested the kidnappings could have been in retaliation for the killing of the commander of the militia in the southern city of Basra by British-backed Iraqi troops last week, the UK government warned that speculation was not helpful. 'The killing is completely indiscriminate, there's no warning' THE lure of seemingly endless pots of cash for private security firms is not worth the price for one Scottish company owner. Ernie Embleton, a former Royal Marine, pulled his Atlas Security Management team out of Iraq last year, after deciding the situation was just "not worth it". The Ayrshire-based security expert told of his experience setting up and running the Baghdad operation: "It is just plain scary out there now. The situation has just deteriorated so much. All our guys have ex-military experience, but there are now a lot of cowboys operating in Iraq. "We were paying our men up to Â£450 a day, but I have heard of some paying as little as Â£150 - which is peanuts. "Some of them parade around in huge 4x4s, which basically tells everyone you are carrying a foreign client, so you become a target. "We would always be covert, driving around in beaten up old taxis, but ensuring they got safely from A to B. "One day last summer, a car bomb went off and two of our guys were injured, one of them really badly. "That's when we realised how bad it was. They had to wait for three hours to be seen at the hospital, just joining the back of the queue with everyone else. "Then we waited nearly a week to get them airlifted home because we were told that we couldn't use MedEvac. Out there, we also had no back up, or quick reaction force, so you feel quite exposed. "Certainly we had problems in Iraq, we had to bring people home because they didn't want to be there. It is a very intimidating situation. In Iraq, the killing is completely indiscriminate, you have no warning and neither do the civilians. "There are more and more cowboys operating in Iraq. They are unregulated and simply under-cutting the rates. We have moved our operations to Afghanistan now. It is a lot more controlled and not as wide-scale a threat. "Even if we wanted to go back to Iraq, I don't think we would get the guys to do it. It got to the point where we were constantly walking on eggshells. There was nowhere you could feel safe. "It is worse now as the new threat is targeting security companies." Hung Like A Horse , Guga is Jealous / 3:21am 31 May 2007 I'm praying for their safe return. / 8:24am 31 May 2007 Horse...

There won't be much security either until Iraq is given its own country back, and the neocon invaders leave. That won't be until all the oil is gone; pity so many people have to be murdered so the USA can get their hands on it. David - another one , Edinburgh / 11:01am 31 May 2007 The people of Iraq are rightly proud of their place in the world and long history. Their country was weak after years of sanctions imposed by the UN, sanctions which the people of Iraq could do nothing about. Then foreigners invaded, killing many in the process. They demonstrated utter contempt for the people of Iraq in many ways, including snatching people off the streets in order to torture them. The invaders showed what they were really after by only surrounding the oil ministry after the invasion and ignoring everything else. They introduced new laws to privatise everything in order to hand Iraq on a plate to their financial backers, large western companies. The invaders even had a design for a new flag for Iraq. The invaders made things far worse for the people of Iraq. It is hardly surprising that resistance against the invaders grew and continues to grow. The resistance will undoubtedly continue until the invaders are booted out and go home with their tails between their legs. After that it may just be possible to undo the damage the invaders have done, though they may well have done so much damage that the mess they have made cannot be repaired. Mr Bush once stood in front of a banner which read, "mission accomplished". If it wasn't so serious we could laugh at the arrogance the banner represented.

This is what they feel they are suppose to do. Kill all those that do not believe as they do. I hope some of you are standing at the front of the line to give up your God and your faith when they come for you. I am not a supporter of this war in Iraq but come on folks - the truth is the truth - they are not blonde haired Swedes that are causing all the wars of the world. It is the Muslims. I want someone to stand up against them and STOP them in whatever way they can be stopped. , Edinburgh / 4:25pm 31 May 2007 The White House claimed that the banner was requested by the crew of the Lincoln, who did not have the facilities for producing such a banner. Afterwards, the administration and naval sources stated that the banner was the Navyâ€™s idea, White House staff members made the banner, and it was hung by the U.S. Navy personnel. A White House spokesman told CNN â€œWe took care of the production of it. But the Navy actually put it up.â€ According to John Dickerson of TIME magazine, the White House later conceded that they actually hung the banner but still insists it had been done at the request of the crew members. Many in the administration came to regret the slogan.

Letter to the Editor Sell your car for free in print and online Place a classified newspaper ad Links from the paper Pope blesses picture of Maddie By Philip Pullella in Vatican City May 31, 2007 08:10am THE parents of abducted four-year-old Madeleine McCann have drawn strength from a meeting with Pope Benedict XVI where he blessed a photograph of their daughter. Madeleine's mother Kate appeared to be holding back tears as she and her husband Gerry, both Catholics, met the Pope in St Peter's Square. "He said he would pray for us and our family and for Madeleine's safe return," Mrs McCann said. During their brief meeting, Mrs McCann held up a photograph of Madeleine. The Pope touched it gently, blessed it by making the sign of the cross and then spoke words of comfort. "It was very emotional but also a positive experience... that photograph will stay with me," she said. The couple met the Pope when he walked over to a section reserved for special guests at the outdoor audience attended by tens of thousands of people. Mr McCann, who kissed the Pope's hand, said later he and his wife were touched and encouraged by the Pope's gestures. "It was more personal than anything I could have imagined it to be," he said. "There was recognition immediately, looking at Madeleine's photograph, and his touch and thoughts and words were more tender than we could have thought and that will help sustain us during this most difficult time." Mrs McCann was carrying a pink fluffy toy cat that Madeleine had named "cuddle cat" and without whom she could not fall asleep. In his public comments during the audience, the Pope made no reference to Madeleine, who disappeared on May 3. The McCanns said before the audience that they had "mixed emotions" about being in the Vatican. "Under normal circumstances it would be one of the most exciting things we could do in our own lifetime, but very much on our minds is the fact that we're here without Madeleine," Mr McCann said. Madeleine was snatched in the evening from a holiday apartment as her parents ate at a restaurant about 100m away, in sight of the apartment. The world has been gripped by the tragedy and photographs of the blonde-haired child have rarely been off the front pages of newspapers since her abduction. "One evil act seems to be generating so much good... and has restored my faith in humanity," Madeleine's father said. He appealed to holidaymakers travelling in Europe to post pictures of his daughter in public places in the hope someone might have information that could lead to her safe return.

In a defining decision for the multi-religious society, the court ruled against Lina Joy's appeal to have her new faith reflected on her identity card, a move rights groups called a "backward step" for Malaysia. The court had to decide whether the National Registration Department (NRD) was right to require Joy to seek a sharia court's permission to renounce her faith before she could have the word "Islam" removed from her identity card, and whether the civil or sharia courts had jurisdiction in the matter. Joy's argument was that the sharia court, a parallel legal system governing Muslims on property and family matters, had no jurisdiction over her since she had renounced Islam. She argued that she had the right to profess the faith of her choice under the federal constitution. Malaysian law defines ethnic Malays as Muslims and few cases seeking legal recognition of conversions have been successful. Lina Joy case timeline Azlina Jailani makes statutory declaration renouncing Islam and is baptised a Christian Officially changes her name to Lina Joy Files case in High Court seeking legal recognition of conversion High Court dismisses case. Judge says matter falls under sharia jurisdiction Court of Appeal upholds High Court ruling Federal Court dismisses final appeal Muslims seeking official recognition of their conversion out of Islam risk being hauled up by religious authorities and sent to "faith restoration" camps where they are expected to "repent" and recant. Born Azlina Jailani to Malay parents, Joy was raised a Muslim but embraced Christianity when she was 26. In 1999, she changed her official name to Lina Joy but her identity card still listed her religion as Islam. The Court of Appeal had in 2005 ruled that the NRD was right in rejecting Joy's application to remove the word "Islam" from her identity card. She was reportedly baptised in 1998 in a church in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and recorded her renunciation of Islam through a statutory declaration the same year. Official recognition would have allowed Joy to legally marry her Christian fiance. Under Malaysian law, non-Muslims wishing to marry Muslim partners are required to convert to Islam. But the three-member Federal Court bench delivered the judgment that she could not officially cease to be a Muslim. Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim, head of the Malaysian judiciary delivered the majority decision while Richard Malanjum dissented, almost a year after hearing Joy's final appeal. The Federal Court ruled that the sharia court had jurisdiction despite Joy's conversion [AP] S Sharmila, a human rights lawyer and secretary-general of the National Human Rights Society, described Wednesday's ruling as a "very regressive interpretation of the constitution as a living document" and "backward step" for "If there is any hope left, it is in the resounding dissenting judgement which is based on facts, law and logic," she told Al Jazeera shortly after the ruling was made. "It is a very bold decision that signals a clear and unequivocal dissent which preserves the fundamental principle to choose one's faith based on the constitutional right of all Malaysians being equal before the law." She said Malanjum held that the NRD policy was unconstitutional and should be struck down. The case has triggered fierce debate in a country where just over half the 27 million population are Muslims with a sizeable number of Buddhists, Christians and Hindus. According to the latest US state department data on Malaysia, ethnic Malays &#8211; who are Muslims by law - make up about half the population but are officially grouped together as , or sons of the soil, with indigenous groups who make up 11 per cent of the population, not all of whom are Muslims. Joy, her fiance and her lawyers have all received death threats, and streets protests have been held by Muslim groups including the Islam-based PAS opposition party. Muslims who try to convert legally can be sent to "faith restoration" camps [GALLO/GETTY] Wednesday's ruling is seen as a landmark that will set the precedent for other cases where former Muslims have applied for legal recognition of their conversion to other faiths, several of which are pending in court. Sa'adiah Din, a sharia lawyer in Kuala Lumpur, said Wednesday's court decision had determined that the country's civil courts do not have jurisdiction over Malaysian Muslims wishing to renounce their faith. "The crux of this case is whether the apex court is going to uphold the apex law of Malaysia which is the [federal] constitution that guarantees the freedom of religion," she said before the ruling. In July last year, the government in effect banned all public discussions on religious freedom amid simmering tensions between Muslim groups and rights activists. The talks had been organised by a coalition called Article 11, named after the clause in the constitution which guarantees freedom of religion for all Malaysians. Ivy Josiah, the executive director of Women's Aid Organisation (WAO), said the choice of life partners was an issue close to women's hearts. "The fact that she wants to be a mother and her biological clock is ticking away is terribly unfair to her or anyone else," she said. "The court obviously did not uphold human rights principles based on the federal constitution, especially on the question of whether we recognise that one has the freedom to choose one's religion and partner." Josiah said many people, particularly non-Muslims, were concerned that Malaysia was slipping into an unconstitutional situation.

The former South African leader held hands with Mr Blair and his wife, Cherie, as he paid tribute to the prime minister and to his long-time chancellor and successor, Gordon Brown. "I look forward to welcoming a young person like you to the club of retired presidents. I need to say to you that some of us only became active after stepping down from office," Mr Mandela said. "Your energy, passion and youth mean that you can still play a big role in international affairs and we look forward to the contribution you can make." Mr Mandela, reading from a prepared statement, added: "Gordon Brown is also a dear friend of Africa. I look forward to Gordon's premiership of Britain. I am happy to say that we will see the same commitment and passion for Africa from him." Earlier, Mr Blair had defended his "thoroughly interventionist" foreign policy in a farewell speech at the University of South Africa Business School in Midrand, near the capital, Pretoria. Taking questions from academics after the speech, Mr Blair laid out his agenda for action on climate change at next week's G8 summit, and he offered sympathy for the US's controversial resistance to the Kyoto agreement. The prime minister said it would be a "major breakthrough" if G8 agreed around three key principles. But he warned that the growth of China and India meant that the US was unlikely to agree significant change Without commitment from those countries, Mr Blair said, "the political reality of America, whoever is in office, is that they will not agree a climate change deal if it does not have China in it and possibly India. To be completely blunt about it, that's not for a completely stupid reason." China's growth in emissions over the next two years would be the same as Britain's entire carbon footprint, he added. The changes he hopes to achieve next week were: "One, we agree that climate change is an urgent and pressing problem; two, that we need a deal after Kyoto that America, China, India, as well as the rest of us, are part of; and three, that we need a specific global goal for stabilising the climate with a view to greenhouse emissions. "If we are able to get those elements agreed next week I think that is a major step forward. And I hope very much that our American colleagues agree that that is so." President Bush is expected to make a statement later today. Send it to a friend Join our dating site today Guardian Unlimited &copy; Guardian News and Media Limited 2007

So many leading groups and individuals around the whole world have come together." Venezuela, RCTV, And Media Freedom: Just The Facts, Please Lessons In Curtailing Media Freedom There are a number of ways to curtail press freedom. You can charge a journalist with murder and put him on death row-Mumia Abu-Jamal, for instance. You can grant special favors, privileges, and access to corporate media giants while raiding and shutting down low-power, independent radio stations, which the FCC does with some regularity. You could arrest independent journalists at anti-war demonstrations-again, a regular occurrence. For instance, I recall my friend and Indy journalist, Jeff Imig, who has been repeatedly threatened with arrest, while recording anti-war demonstrations in Tucson, Arizona, for violating the statute against filming federal buildings. Jeff finally got arrested-for jaywalking! Corporate press, on the other hand, seems to have free reign to jaywalk and film federal buildings at these same events-behavior I and countless others have witnessed! And then there is the Mother of All Media Manipulations: the blackout engineered by the Bush administration which blocks media from showing the arrival of body bags and coffins of newly dead soldiers &#8220;coming home&#8221; from Iraq. Those are some pretty good ways of curtailing freedom of speech. And they&#8217;re each and everyone home grown right here in the good ol&#8217; United States of America. So what&#8217;s the deal with Venezuela, anyway? So, pardon me if I&#8217;m just a little astounded by all this noise in the media, the Bush administration, the Senate and the House, about how Venezuela is &#8220;attacking&#8221; free speech and independent media by not renewing the broadcasting license of RCTV. Perhaps even more disturbing is that this ridiculous assertion is being repeated even among some persons on the Left. Just last week the Senate passed a condemnation of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez&#8217; refusal to renew the license. Senate Resolution 211 was sponsored by Richard Lugar, (R-IN) and Christopher Dodd (D-CT), with vocal, and disappointing, support from presidential contenders Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and Barak Obama (D-IL). Rep. Jerry Weller (R-IL) has introduced similar legislation into the House. Puerto Rico&#8217;s delegate to the House, Republican Luis Fortuno has outspokenly supported this legislation, which is surprising, considering his complete lack of action or outcry when the FBI was harassing Puerto Rican journalists in 2006. Anyway, who says bipartisanship is dead? Joining in these condemnations are a whole host of so-called &#8220;press freedom&#8221; advocates, lead by the National Endowment for Democracy funded Reporters Without Borders. One would think that the iron hand has fallen and the crackdown has begun in Venezuela. Corporate media seems to regularly forget that along with freedom of press is the responsibility of presenting facts to back up their news reporting. Well, dear reader, you are in for a rare treat-a discussion of some actual facts. The general situation is this: In April of 2002, there was a two-day, illegal coup carried out against Venezuela&#8217;s electoral government, which involved the kidnapping and jailing of President Hugo Chavez. There were four major media outlets, along with others, who actively aided and abetted this coup (more later). In the intervening five years, none of them were closed, nor were any of their journalists incarcerated. Rather, the Chavez administration met with them, not to change their editorial slant, but to reach agreements preventing a repeat of such anti-democratic measure and the hyperbolic misrepresentation of facts, and also to discourage such continued infractions as the airing of pornography and cigarette commercials. Another important fact is that the heads of the media-monopoly in Venezuela, including Marcel Granier -owner of RCTV, also participated in the economic sabotage that occurred between 2002-2003. Yet, no one went to prison for endangering the country&#8217;s social and economic stability. What is truly amazing is that it has taken five years for the Chavez administration to take action in any way against media that helped carry out this coup. Certainly, if the same thing happened in the United States, it wouldn&#8217;t be tolerated. Just ask Aaron Burr or Timothy McVeigh what happens when folks plot against the existing, elected government. The fact is.you don&#8217;t get away with it, you get punished, and pretty severely. Getting their broadcasting licenses renewed would be the least of their problems. When RCTV&#8217;s broadcasting license came up for review, Pres. Chavez decided, after exhaustive research and study, not to renew the license. Chavez is legally responsible for renewing such licenses under laws which were enacted before he became president. The reasons given for not renewing the license cite RCTV&#8217;s participation in the coup, plus the fact that RCTV leads Venezuelan media in infractions of communications laws. RCTV&#8217;s problems pre-date the Chavez administration, having been censured and closed repeatedly in previous presidential administrations. RCTV leads Venezuela in its violation of communications codes, with 652 infractions. Another interesting fact is that our corporate media and distinguished Members of Congress have neglected to mention that on April of 2007 the government of Peru did not renew the broadcasting licenses of two TV stations and three radio stations for breaking their Radio and Television laws. It is obvious that Venezuela continues to be a target. What, then, are the facts behind the charges made by the Chavez administration? On the morning of April 11th, 2002, the first day of the coup, the anti-Bolivarian opposition had started a march from the headquarters of the state owned oil company. Across town, supporters of the Bolivarian Revolution were gathered outside the presidential palace. Breaking with its previously announced plan, the opposition changed directions and headed to the presidential palace, greatly increasing the chances of a violent confrontation between the two opposing sides. During the midst of this confusion, shots rang out from the rooftops, where snipers were firing on both crowds, resulting in the deaths of 18 persons, with 150 wounded. Reports on the opposition&#8217;s four largest TV stations indicated the violence was the result of pro-Bolivarian gunmen, and this became the immediate catalyst &#8220;justifying&#8221; the coup. However, the testimony of eyewitnesses and videos taken from other angles show that a much different scenario was actually taking place. The following transcript is excerpted from the video documentary, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, which was produced for television in Ireland. It sheds important light on the sequence of events. Note particularly the quotation included from RCTV News Correspondent, Andre Cesara. NARRATOR: The opposition march was fast approaching and some in the vanguard seemed ready for a fight. With thousands of Chavez supporters still surrounding the palace a confrontation seemed imminent. Then at about 2:00 p.m., we saw the opposition march arrive. The army tried to act as a buffer between the two groups. [shouting] NARRATOR: We moved back into the heart of the Chavez crowds when all of a sudden the firing started. [sirens] NARRATOR: We couldn&#8217;t tell where the shots were coming from, but people were being hit in the head. [gunshots] NARRATOR: Soon it became clear that we were being shot at by snipers. One in four Venezuelans carry hand guns and soon some of the Chavez supporters began to shoot back in the direction the sniper fire seemed to be coming from. WITNESS (in Spanish): One of the channels had a camera opposite the palace that captured images of people shooting from the bridge. It looks like they are shooting at the opposition march below, but you can see them, they themselves are ducking. They are clearly being shot at, but the shots of them ducking were never shown. The Chavez supporters were blamed. The images were manipulated and shown over and over again to say that Chavez supporters had assassinated innocent marchers. ANDRE CESARA, RCTV journalist (in Spanish): Look at that Chavez supporter. Look at him empty his gun. That Chavez supporter has just fired on the unarmed peaceful protesters below. NARRATOR: What the TV stations didn&#8217;t broadcast was this camera angle which clearly shows the streets below were empty. The opposition march had never taken that route. With this manipulation, the deaths could now be blamed on Chavez. There is no doubt, and no dispute, that RCTV and the three other largest corporate television stations (Globovision, Venevision, and Televen) aided and abetted the ensuing coup throughout the three day period it was being carried out. They knowingly broadcast false and manipulated information, including the lies that Bolivarian supporters instigated violence against demonstrators, and that Pres. Chavez, as a result, had willingly resigned and left the country. Pres. Chavez had not resigned. He had been kidnapped and was being held prisoner by traitors within the Venezuelan military. During all this, RCTV hosted coup plotters, including co-leader Carlos Ortega of the corrupt and US government supported labor union, the CTV, and had broadcast Ortega&#8217;s appeal rallying demonstrators to march on the presidential palace. RCTV and its partners undertook a complete blackout on reporting any news relating to the more than a million citizens who had taken to the street and surrounded the presidential palace in defense of the democratically elected government of Venezuela. Rather than broadcasting this news, RCTV treated its viewers to reruns of Tom and Jerry cartoons and the movie Pretty Woman. Vice-Admiral Ramirez Perez spoke for all his fellow coup plotters when told a Venevision reporter, &#8220;We had a deadly weapon: the media. And now that I have the opportunity, let me congratulate you.&#8221; His congratulations were premature, however, as multitudes of people in the street, with the aid of truly independent, community based media and patriots within the Venezuelan military were able to defeat this coup without firing a shot, returning Pres. Chavez to his rightful office on April 13, 2002. On the Job at RCTV-Eyewitness, Andres Izarra Speaks If any doubts remain as to RCTV&#8217;s complicity in this coup, the voice of one of its own producers should lay them all to rest. Andres Izarra had worked as the assignment editor in charge of Latin America for CNN before being hired by RCTV as news production manager for Venezuela&#8217;s highest ranked newscast, El Observador. Izarra says, quite clearly, &#8220;We were told no pro-Chavez material was to be screened&#8221;. Later, RCTV officials would maintain that they could not film pro-Bolivarian demonstrations for security reasons. Even if that were true, Izarra notes, footage of these demonstrations was available from sources such as CNN. RCTV also continued broadcasting reports that President Chavez had willfully resigned and left the country, even though Izarra notes that they were receiving news to the contrary, and that Mexico, Argentina, and France had all issued statements condemning the coup and refusing to recognize the new government. Conversely, the United States welcomed this illegal government. Izarra says the last straw came for him when, &#8220;We had a reporter in Miraflores and knew that it had been retaken by the Chavistas.[but] the information blackout stood. That&#8217;s when it was enough for me, and I decided to leave&#8221;. Asked what he thought the response should be to this level of disinformation, Izarra replied, &#8220;I think their licenses should be revoked&#8221;. Having had enough of corporate media&#8217;s complicity in blocking news reportage, Izarra now serves as head of Telesur, the joint news channel broadcast by the nations of Venezuela, Argentina, Bolivia, and Cuba. As Patrick McElwee, of Just Foreign Policy, points out: &#8220;It is frankly amazing that this company has been allowed to broadcast for 5 years after the coup, and that the Chavez government waited until its license expired to end its use of the public airwaves.&#8221; Despite their participation in the coup, the Chavez administration entered into repeated negotiations with RCTV and its partners, Venevision, Globovision, and Television to make sure that such crass manipulation of the news would not occur again, and about other infractions. RCTV refused to reach any agreements. Despite the nonrenewal of its broadcasting license, cable and satellite broadcasts will still be available to RCTV; moreover they will continue to broadcast through their two radio stations in Venezuela. The new broadcasting license is being given to a public station, TVes-Venezuela Social Television, which will run shows produced mainly by independent parties. The station will be controlled not by the government, but by a foundation of community members, with one chair reserved for a government representative. TVes also hopes to reach into some of the most remote areas of the nation, not covered before by RCTV. The coup government and media freedom-an alternative? There is, indeed, an example that shows a real alternative to how Pres. Chavez and the Bolivarian movement deals with freedom of the media and freedom of speech. The two-day coup government of Pedro Carmona revealed that alternative. But, first, let&#8217;s quickly review the general state of media freedom in Venezuela under the presidency of Hugo Chavez. Shortly after Chavez became president, media law was reformed so that it became legal for anyone who could broadcast to do so. In the United States, many fans of underground and independent radio speak fondly of &#8220;pirate&#8221; radio-low powered, but illegal stations broadcast from small, &#8220;renegade&#8221; transmitters. There are no &#8220;pirate&#8221; radio stations in Venezuela, because such stations are legal. Rather, there is a significant Community Media movement-community based and non-profit media production centers run locally by community volunteers. Corporate and opposition media also have great freedom in Venezuela. In fact, the radio and television airwaves, and the print media as well, continue to be dominated by corporations which support the opposition. There is no shortage of negative opinions and portrayals of Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution-in fact, these remain the standard among the for-profit news and entertainment industry. This concept is strange to those of us in the United States, where official party lines and major news sources are virtually indistinguishable from each other. But while corporate and community media both retain enormous freedoms in Venezuela, the April 11-13th, 2002 coup, and the two day coup government, provide a much different example. Once interloper Pedro Carmona had declared himself President of Venezuela, among the very first actions taken by the coup government involved the suppression of Venezuela&#8217;s non-corporate media. Police troops answering to Carmona raided and shut down Channel 8, the government TV station. They ordered the Catholic Church&#8217;s Radio Fe y Alegria to play only music and not report national events, lest they also be shut down. Carmona&#8217;s raiders also hit a number of Community Media centers, closing down, among others, TV Caricua, Catia TV, and Radio Perola. Fortunately, reporters from Catia TV and Radio Perola were able to escape and recapture their transmitters. Because of this, they were able to provide mobile broadcasts to the people of Venezuela of the news that RCTV and its partners were blacking out. Another action taken by the Carmona government was to release the persons who had been arrested in connection with the sniper attacks that instigated the coup. Instead, coup forces arrested independent journalist Nicolas Rivera and accused him of participating in these attacks. The only weapon Rivera had had with him during these demonstrations was a tape recorder-obviously considered a threat by coup plotters. Rivera was freed after the two-day coup was defeated and democratic government was reestablished. However, the scars of his detention remained, with his face disfigured by the torture he had endured while incarcerated. Rivera&#8217;s wife said that the forces that raided their home planted a sack of bullets on Rivera, beat both of them, and threatened to kill their children. Yet despite these attacks and threats to this journalist and his family, not one, single international organization in &#8220;defense&#8221; of press freedoms spoke out on behalf of Rivera. Perhaps it was in this case that Reporters Without Borders found its border. Also silent about these attacks on freedom of speech and press were both houses of the US Congress, both parties, the Bush administration..no, there was no resolution of any kind condemning the attacks by the coup government on these freedoms. Could that be because coup leaders were funded by Congress, via USAID and the so-called National Endowment for Democracy, and were aided, abetted, and advised by the Bush Administration, the State Department, and the US military? Just maybe these factors were an influence. While Representatives and Senators weep bipartisan crocodile tears about supposed threats to media rights in Venezuela; while US and Venezuelan corporate press crow about the &#8220;unfair&#8221; targeting of RCTV; while even some segments of the US Left express &#8220;concern&#8221; about press freedoms in Venezuela; an examination of the facts leads one to this clear conclusion: these folks are full of a substance that emanates from the hind end of a male bovine. Fact: not renewing the broadcasting license of coup plotters, lawbreakers, and liars like RCTV is the kind of thing it takes to defend Venezuela and make it the haven of free speech, free media, and participatory democracy that it is today.

Has everyone conveniently forgotten that this individual that now accuses others of &#8220;plotting coups&#8221; was himself an unsuccessful &#8220;golpista&#8221;? Chavez should be rotting in jail, not closing down TV stations! After RCTV, Chavez has now threatened other media outlets, including the news channel Globovision and various radio stations. Chavez will not stop until he has created a communist dictatorship like the one in Cuba. So I guess if you love Fidel and Cuba&#8217;s present social, political, and economic systems - then you just gotta love Chavez! on 30 May 2007 at 5:33 pm This is how the Venezuelan government, and the people that support it, lead their &#8220;Bolivarian Revolution&#8221; and attack students, that exercise their right to protest. on 30 May 2007 at 5:50 pm Chavez himself was responsible coup long before this. He was arrested but released after serving 2 years. In the US, such crime would never permit him to run for president and he would likely still be in jail, if not facing afiring squad for treason! on 30 May 2007 at 6:01 pm on 30 May 2007 at 6:55 pm &#8220;When RCTVâ€™s broadcasting license came up for review, Pres. Chavez decided, after exhaustive research and study, not to renew the license.&#8221; Oh come on. Now you&#8217;re just making it up. &#8216;Exhaustive&#8217; research and study my hairy arse. You guys are living in a fantasy land. Atravete! on 30 May 2007 at 7:30 pm A few more facts: FACT: Andres Izarra is the son of William Izarra, a coupster who accompanied Chavez in his coup attempt in 1992 and has been working for the Chavez government at least since 2003. At the time the film came out he was working in the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, became later Minister of Information, and later headed TeleSur, the news TV station owned by the government. FACT: The video showing that the shooters were aiming the police (or an empty street!!) was actually taken a few hours before (about noon) the one showed on TV (about 4PM), as Wolfgang Schalk demonstrated in his analysis of that propaganda and extremely dishonest film. FACT: Gen. Lucas Rincon announced on April 11 that Chavez had resigned on national TV and radio. He was later to become Chavez&#8217;s minister of Defence and currently Ambassadro in Portugal. This FACT, by the way does not appear in the film. FACT: An estimated 90,000 people have lost their lives due to street crime in Venezuela. An estimate because the Chavez government stopped giving statistics to the press. The last year when they gave numbers was in 2003, when 13,000 were murdered, up from 3,000 in 1997. FACT: During the events of April 2002, Chavez ordered all TV and radio stations to broadcast him talking while the shootings were taking on the streets. The TV stations decided then to split the screen to allow the Venezuelan people what was happening. By the way, you would not know this if you saw that propaganda and extremely dishonest film. on 30 May 2007 at 7:34 pm 1. The April 2002 &#8220;coup&#8221; was the result of militray officers refusing ChavezÂ´s orders to fire on peaceful protesters. They demanded his resignation and he accepted. That the aftermath was bungled by some sectors of the opposition, allowing for ChavezÂ´s return to power, does not change the initial circumstances. 2. Of the five television networks cited as supporting the &#8220;coup&#8221;, only two (RCTV and Globovision)have maintained an anti-Chavez stance. They are the ones now being targeted . The other three have executed a dramatic shift in editorial slant, becoming as pro-government as the state media outlets. 3. This anti-Chavez stance has been characterized by the sort of reporting on the countryÂ´s economic, social and political ills that any professional, responsible and ethical journalist would undertake. Informing the public about rampant crime, inflation, food shortages, official corruption, flagrant violations of the rule of law and the constitution and government associations with rogue states (Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Zimbabwe)have all been curtailed by RCTVÂ´s closure, as they are ignored or mega-spun by state and state-friendly media. 4. The assertion that RCTVÂ´s closure has anything to do with broadcasting cigarette advertisement and pornography is blatantly untrue. 5. Chavez is now targetting the only remaining network (Globovions)that is critical of his regime. He has also threatened radio and print media. How can a country be considered democratic if the only reporting allowed must be government-friendly? 6. Government allegations that RCTV promotes a coup-plotting oligarchy are belied by the following: a. Chavez himself carried out a failed coup against a democratically-elected government in 1992, driving tanks into the presidential palace in an attempt to institute military rule. Contrast this to the militaryÂ´s refusal to attack peaceful demonstrators in 2002. b. 40% of Venezuelans voted against Chavez in the December 2006 elections. ThatÂ´s some oligarchy. c. Speaking of the oligarchs, it is widely accepted that Chavez receives support from some of the very oligarchs he lambasts (please look up the Cisneros family for details; they own Venevision, one of the &#8220;coup-plotting&#8221; TV stations that has been spared RCTVÂ´s fate by becoming a government-friendly media puppet). d. Anyone with any current business experience in Venezuela can also attest to the rise of the new Chavista social class: nouveau riche cronies swilling Chivas Regal, driving luxury cars and Hummers and flaunting millions in cash in the name of the revolution who will openly applaud the government for allowing them to &#8220;make it big&#8221;. 7. While protests take place in Venezuela after RCTVÂ´s closure, its government-funded replacement (TVES)is using RCTVÂ´s illegally-expropriated equipment to broadcast childrenÂ´s puppet shows and dubbed American b-movies. 8. Recent polls undertaken by the same organizations that predicted Chavez would win the 2006 elections report that 80% of Venezuelans are against RCTVÂ´s closure. Man, that oligarchy just doubled in size. Its OK to be anti-Bush and pro-left. Its OK to champion the poor and fight against the powers-that-be. But its entirely wrongheaded, irresponsible and dangerous to transpose these ideas onto another countryÂ´s precarious situation without having the facts straight. on 30 May 2007 at 7:35 pm Censership for the leftest &#8230; good cenership on the right &#8230;. bad Go home jorden it&#8217;s what you want on 30 May 2007 at 8:44 pm I WONDER IF YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE TO THESE COMMENTS!!! on 30 May 2007 at 8:55 pm I am severly dissappointed in this article. Unfortunately, president Chavez has been able to propagate pro-Chavez propaganda to the international media very successfully, and as a consequence has blinded or confused many international views that the world has of Venezuela and the current political situation. I am myself a Venezuelan, and have been in these marches and protests, and have witnessed the cruelty and blatant disregard to human rights and human life that the current Venezuelan Government has shown for the last 8 years. What is going on in Venezuela is wrong, and if this was a true democracy, then why is the national guard and the metropolitan police shooting against highschool students, college students, civilian buildings and homes because the citizes want to exercise their right to protest? Yes, they are protesting against the closing of the nations 1st Tv channel for political and personal reasons. Not only that, but the president has publicly threatened the people, and has warned the people that they should stop these peaceful protests done by the citizens of this country. Democracy was built to defend the desires of the people, and the people do not agree with the closing of this TV channel. Another fact, the supreme court has tried to force the TV channel to deliver private property (equipment needed to run a TV channel) to the government to be used by the new TC Channel to take its place. I see that as a violation of private property, and an insult to the concept of freedom and democracy. on 30 May 2007 at 8:58 pm â€Chavez loves the poor people so much heâ€™s created millions of new ones.â€ The fact of the matter is that students took to the streets showing courage against the hordes of para-military troops shooting plastic bullets against the massive crowds. Despite the criminal lackeys assaulting innocent and peaceful people in protest against maffioso dictator Castro â€œwannabeâ€ Hugo Chavez Frias, the people of Venezuela are defending liberty. Dictator Chavez is moving Venezuela from Democracy unto an authoritarian regime â€œChavez knows that he cannot establish the dictatorship that he wants to establish in Venezuela without control over the media. A free press is the essential element of a free society.â€ Here is another fact hard to ignore: â€œVenezuela a solid claim to the dubious title of the worldâ€™s capital of violent crime. According to U.N. figures, the rates of gun-related violence are higher here than anywhere else on earth.â€ Under the Hugoâ€™ regime we have more people dead by crime than the bloody war in Iraq â€œVenezuela, a country of 26 million, has recorded an average of nearly 10,000 homicides a year since Chavez took office. The homicide rate, 37 deaths per 100,000 people, is more than double what it was in the 1990s.â€ on 31 May 2007 at 12:24 am Chavez is a violent thug adored by our Hollywood elite. This shows his true, hideous nature. The US should stand in solidarity with the protestors. on 31 May 2007 at 2:30 am Thank you for shining a light through the US media propaganda that has evidently fogged the minds of the others responding to this blog thus far. Why can&#8217;t the United States mind its own business? Our so-called &#8220;Press&#8221; ignores the problems at home and tries to make us feel better by dramatizing and exaggerating the threats imposed from without&#8211;Iraq, Iran, North Korea, now Venezuela. At the least, those who responded so passionately to your well-written and documented piece ought to be willing to admit that there just may be another side to the story. And that we ought to allow the people of Venezuela to make up their own minds about the facts in their country. Also, you provided documentation for your assertions. The other respondents have not. Apparently, they are happy to live with US propaganda. It also helps me understand who the people are who are willing to vote for and support a President who also makes assertions without providing evidence&#8211;and worse. Please keep up the good work. We need a counter to US news propaganda and you are one of the (sadly) very few providing it. on 31 May 2007 at 3:20 am It&#8217;s amazing! The rich, well educated Venezuelans express themselves quite clear. That&#8217;s not what I hear from the PEOPLE, the real peasants, workers, farmers around the country. Let&#8217;s put it this way: (let me be childish this time) the struggle in my country, nowadays, is between the good people against the bad and greedy people. Thanks Media Channel for being a light in this international media &#8220;falseout&#8221; on 31 May 2007 at 9:11 am I understand your criticism towards the US media. However, what goes on in Venezuela at the moment is not democracy. Chavez plays martyr very well and people like the ones who write this article should take a closer look. Try and live in Venezuela for a while and then write about it, maybe try living in Cuba and then write about it. This so called facts are a propaganda to promote erratic behavior. Chavez a previous coup attempter should not have a say in the matter. on 31 May 2007 at 1:50 pm . . . and by the way, since I too live in a &#8220;developing country,&#8221; what percentage of Venezuelan citizens, who are not from the tiny rich elite who benefit from anti-Chavez activity, have excellent English? Similar &#8220;commentary,&#8221; written in perfect or nearly perfect idiomatic English, about political events in a country where only a tiny percentage of the richest elite would have a chance to learn English to that degree, showed up on blogs and news sites after the recent tainted Mexican election.

Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, described those wanting to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities as "new crazies". They had not learned the lessons of Iraq, added Dr ElBaradei. He made his comments in an interview for a BBC Radio 4 documentary to be broadcast at 2000BST on Friday. This is not the first time that Dr ElBaradei has spoken out against the possibility of using force against Iran, but it is perhaps his strongest warning to date. Tehran is still refusing to bow to demands from the UN Security Council to halt its uranium enrichment programme, which the United States fears would give it access to material for a bomb. You do not want to give additional argument to new crazies who say 'let's go and bomb Iran' Dr ElBaradei said a nuclear-armed Iran would be terrible but the jury was still out as to whether the country even wanted nuclear weapons. But he said you could not "bomb knowledge", and he was scathing towards those who still favoured air strikes after the experience of intervention in Iraq. "I wake every morning and see 100 Iraqis innocent civilians are dying," he said. "I have no brief other than to make sure we don't go into another war or that we go crazy into killing each other. You do not want to give additional argument to new crazies who say 'let's go and bomb Iran.'" Asked who the "new crazies" were he replied: "Those who have extreme views and say the only solution is to impose your will by force." Dr ElBaradei said he was not referring to President George Bush but his remarks are likely to be interpreted as a swipe at those neo-conservatives in the US who still favour military action. In the light of Iran's secretive dealings with black market nuclear suppliers he said it owed his agency a confession over its once clandestine activities. In his latest report, last week, he said Iran continued to enrich uranium and information on its activities was now "deteriorating." Dr ElBaradei angered the US, UK, France and Germany backing the idea that Iran should be allowed limited uranium enrichment under strict supervision. His comments last week sparked immediate complaints from the countries. Inside the IAEA - A year with the nuclear detectives will be broadcast BBC Radio 4, 2000 BST 31 May and 7 June 2000 BST.

Sporadic cellular telephone service contributed to the chaos after the bombing, resulting in different reports on the number of dead and injured. U.S. military officials say one policeman was killed in the blast and eight people were wounded, but a Fallujah police official says 25 people were killed, including at least ten policemen and many as 50 were wounded. A city official says at least 20 people were killed in the blast. The bomber was standing among a group of police recruitslined up to apply for jobs when he detonated the explosives in a vest he was wearing. The center had just opened in eastern Fallujah on Saturday. Suicide bombers have targeted police stations throughout the course of the Iraq war, as Sunni insurgents and al-Qaida operatives engage in an ongoing attempt to disrupt normal operations throughout the country. The attacks are also intended to discourage Iraqis from cooperating with U.S. troops and the new Iraqi government. In Baghdad, some 40 miles away, U.S. forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al-Qaida gunmen in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood in an engagement that lasted several hours. Residents in the neighborhood had called for U.S. help because members of al-Qaida, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final examinations, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from al-Qaida. Clashes continued into Thursday afternoon, and the council official said the al-Qaida leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the U.S. military. Meanwhile, U.S. and Iraqi forces continued the search Thursday for five kidnapped Britons. The five were abducted on Tuesday from an Iraqi Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad. The kidnapped victims include four security agents working for the Montreal-based Garda World Security Corporation and one employee of BearingPoint, a McLean, Va.-based management consulting firm.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Exiled former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has urged his supporters to accept the disbanding of his party and a five-year political ban on its top leadership. "As party leader, I humbly accept the ruling and I want to urge the CNS and government to hold general elections as soon as possible," Thaksin, living in London since his ouster in a coup last year, said in a statement read out by his lawyer in Bangkok. He was referring to the Council for National Security (CNS), as the coup leaders call themselves.

Days after extradition papers were served by UK authorities, Andrei Lugovoi said British secret services were involved in his former friend's murder. Worsening relations: Putin and Blair Litvinenko died in a London hospital in November after his tea was poisoned with rare radioactive isotope polonium-210. Mr Lugovoi says the British secret services were involved in his murder - and that his former friend had been working for MI6. Sky News Russia Correspondent Alex Rossi said the claims would intensify the already frosty relations between Britain and Russia. President Vladimir Putin's government has already made clear it has no intention of extraditing Mr Lugovoi. Referring to Mr Lugovoi's press conference, Rossi said: "The language fitted Soviet times rather than the 21st century. "He claimed Alexander Litvinenko had become too much of a nuisance for MI6 and effectively they got rid of him with polonium-210. "He's countering the allegations made against him and the circumstantial evidence of the polonium trail that followed him from Moscow to Britain. "And he's saying that it's not just Russia that has access to polonium-210, but that the poison would have the mark of a Soviet-style assassination and the blame would be batted back to the Kremlin." Mr Lugovoi claimed he had evidence that the British secret services were aware of what was happening even if they did not commit the murder themselves. Rossi added: "There may be a lot of people out there who think this is rubbish but there may also be people who think this has the ring of truth in it. "The key thing is that there are only a few people London who know whether this is true, and only a few people in Moscow who know whether this is true, and all of those people are either not with us any more or in jobs where they are not going to talk about it. "But it certainly ramps up the war of words between London and Moscow." This month Tony Blair himself criticised Russia, drawing attention to Vladimir Putin's energy policy, and saying he had concerns about human rights in Russia. Mr Putin, meanwhile, publicly criticised the UK ambassador to Russia for attending a conference organised by the opposition.

The Quartet, which includes Russia, the United States, the United Nations and the EU, urged an end to fighting Wednesday between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, calling on the Palestinian government to do everything necessary to restore law and order. The group, which met in Berlin, also urged all Palestinians to immediately renounce all acts of violence and respect the cease-fire. Alaa el-Hadidy, a spokesman for Egypt's foreign ministry, described the Quartet's statement Thursday as unbalanced. "This is tantamount to giving a green light to Israel to continue its operations in the Palestinian territories," el-Hadidy said in a statement. "The credibility of the Quartet, as a neutral side, is now at stake." A five-month truce in Gaza unraveled earlier this month when Hamas began firing barrages of rockets into southern Israel, prompting Israel to respond with a series of air strikes. More than 50 Palestinians, most of them militants, and two Israeli civilians have been killed. The four countries also called for the release of British Broadcasting Corp. journalist Alan Johnston, who was kidnapped in Gaza on March 12. "How come the Quartet demands the immediate release of an Israeli soldier and does not condemn the kidnapping of the Palestinian lawmakers?" el-Hadidy said. Israel has arrested dozens of senior Hamas officials, including lawmakers and government ministers, as part of the recent crackdown. The group has seen renewed activity in recent months, though violence has continued. They plan to meet again in June, this time with Arab representatives in the Middle East. The Quartet produced the stalled road map peace plan that was to culminate with statehood for the Palestinians.

Wealth managers and private banks are expanding to meet the demand from the growing numbers of affluent but â€œtime-poorâ€ investors who want professionals to manage their money for them and treat them as a name and not an account number. The bracket between Â£100,000 and Â£250,000 is below the traditional private banking threshold of Â£500,000 but private banks and wealth managers see this sector as the fastest-growing segment of the market. Many of the private banks, several of them acquired recently by high street banks, are targeting the newly affluent. They want to reach a new generation of high- earning clients who are growing in number by 7-10 per cent a year, according to research by business strategy consultants MDRC. The growth of wealth management and private banking is in contrast to dwindling branch networks and declining service offered by the high street banks. The private banks and wealth managers are opening new offices. Lloyds TSB has started opening private banking lounges in high street branches around the UK to offer an exclusive service to its clients. Recent openings include Richmond Upon Thames and the Law Courts in London. Many of the private banks and wealth managers promise old-fashioned personal service â€“ if they like the size of your portfolio. Lloyds TSB Private Banking has 45,000 clients and targets those with assets of Â£250,000 or more but will consider those below, especially those with potential to add to their wealth. It will also take on clients with Â£100,000 who want to use its asset management service. Independent financial advisers are targeting the affluent too and enjoy the biggest wealth management market share at 33 per cent. US-based wealth manager and stockbroker Edward Jones is expanding rapidly and already has more than 100 offices in the UK, the fastest-growing â€œmass affluentâ€ market in Europe. As the banks and wealth managers have stepped up their services, research suggests that the demographics of the sector are changing rapidly. The number of traditionally wealthy, passing family wealth between generations, is static and has been overtaken by growth in the high- earner category. Many of these are City workers enjoying high salaries and bonuses and those running their own businesses. MDRC chief executive Richard Williams says that growth in the high-earner category has reduced the average age of newly affluent investors from 55 to 47 over the past decade. Despite the growth in private banking and wealth management, one in five affluent investors remains suspicious of external wealth managers and prefers a DIY approach. Some are concerned about the quality of advice and high fees. More people are being persuaded, however, that the time saving alone can make it worth considering a professional wealth manager. Among the new clients of wealth managers are Alan Hunter, 61, and John Haddrell, 45, directors of thriving property rental business Midway in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. As their business grew rapidly along with their personal assets they decided to turn to advisory firm Edward Jones. Their Edward Jones investment representative Vik Sharma regularly visits them at their office and homes. Haddrell, who has a portfolio of more than Â£300,000, says he had previously spent up to seven hours a week managing his own investments. He decided to seek a wealth manager after realising he was spending too much time watching the stock markets and not enough running his business. â€œI was reticent at first to use an adviser because I was concerned about the quality of advice. But I realised that running a business makes life very busy and itâ€™s nice to know somebody is keeping an eye on your investments for you all the time,â€ he says. John Hutchinson, 62, a retired chief executive of a music copyright business, and his wife Elspeth, 60, from Essex, became clients of Lloyds TSB Private Banking last year. Lloyds manages their joint Â£400,000 portfolio and provides tax and trust advice including advice on their two French properties. Barclays Private Banking targets those with more than Â£500,000 but its Premier Banking Service caters for those earning over Â£100,000 or with Â£50,000-plus to invest. HSBC Private Banking offers worldwide offices and Royal Bank of Scotland has expanded its private banking service by acquiring Coutts and Adam & Company. Other private banks include C Hoare & Co, Butterfield Private Bank, Brown Shipley & Co and NM Rothschild & Sons. As the sector has become more competitive, many private banks have added services including independent financial advice, trust and taxation planning and family wealth transfer advice. All offer a personal â€œrelationshipâ€ manager who promises that you will always be a name, not a number. Private banks are not the only providers of wealth management services. There is a growing queue of specialist wealth managers and independent financial advisers targeting the Â£100,000- plus bracket. The Association of Private Client Investment Managers (Apcims) lists more than 200 member firms and the number is growing. Firms offering wealth management services include financial adviser John Scott & Partners, Close Bros, Tilney Investment Management, Killik & Co, and Brewin Dolphin. Andrew Fisher is the chief executive of financial planning business John Scott & Partners, an Apcims member. It has 12 offices, 165 planners and 200,000 clients in the UK. He is a former chief executive of Coutts. He believes that DIY clients in the newly affluent category in particular should give serious consideration to using a wealth manager not just to provide time-saving, professional management but also to provide an valuable external eye on their portfolios. He warns that like medicine, â€œself diagnosisâ€ can be damaging to your financial health. The costs of wealth management will depend on the type of wealth manager but it is worth remembering that the larger the portfolio the lower the annual management percentage fee should be and that fees can be negotiable. Annual charges for portfolio management typically range from 1-2 per cent and private banks will usually charge Â£10-Â£30 per month in bank account fees but will often waive this if large sums are invested.

From eating a fox to draw attention to the plight of crack addicts, to rolling a monkey nut across London with his nose to protest against student fees, Mark McGowan&#039;s methods of protest are as varied as his causes. Here are ten of his best. To protest against student fees, Mark pushed a monkey nut along the road with his nose - for seven miles. Starting out at Goldsmiths College, Mark ended up outside Number 10 Downing Street. On arrival he handed his well-travelled nut to the authorities. He hasn&#039;t always succeeded in reaching his final destination, though. Mark attempted to cartwheel from Brighton to London but after four days on the move he collapsed and was taken into hospital. Mark planned to turn on a cold water tap in the House Gallery in Camberwell and leave it running for one year. The wastage - 15 million litres of water - drew objections from many quarters not least Thames Water, who made him turn the tap off. Mark said the installation was something people could "enjoy aesthetically" as well as being a "comment on a social and environment issue." In 2005 Mark embarked on an art installation where 17,200 multi-coloured clothes pegs would be attached onto an alcoholic called Barry. But somehow, in the end, it was Mark who &#039;got pegged&#039;. On final count, a total of 4,500 pegs had been used. At the end of 2003 Mark attempted to sail from London to Glasgow in a shopping trolley. His plan was to collect gifts from the English and hand them to the Scottish in "reconciliation for the William Wallace thing". But, a mere 65 miles into his ambitious 400 mile voyage, weather conditions overcame his vessel and he was forced to jump ship after just 17 days. 6. 100,000 kisses for Tony Blair On election day in 2005 Mark kissed an A4 colour laminated photograph of Tony Blair on the lips 100,000 times outside 10 Downing Street. 7. Christmas is coming... ...and the Turkey - amongst others - is getting fat. That was Mark&#039;s message when, in 2003, he donned a 27lb turkey atop his head and walked backwards for 11 miles. On his travels he shouted at overweight passers by through a homemade loud hailer. He was campaigning about the obesity pandemic. But he clearly doesn&#039;t regard diet as a major factor in the fight against obesity. Also in 2003, Mark sat in a bath of beans with two chips stuck up his nose and 48 sausages strapped to his head for two weeks, he was advocating the consumption of the much maligned British breakfast. In 2004, Mark popped on his dinner jacket and dined on fox to highlight the plight of crackheads. He asked a simple question: millions of people have marched for fox hunting and millions have marched against, but who is going to march for the crackheads? Earlier this year he tucked into a swan, to protest against "the monarchy, the rich and the upper classes" and, of course, his latest meat-fest is Corgi. 10. Keep the car running Not dissimilar to his running tap installation, Mark planned to keep an Audi 80 running everyday for a year in Peckham, London, to protest against the enormous amounts of unnecessary pollution by, er, producing enormous amounts of unnecessary pollution.

British performance artist Mark McGowan has eaten a corgi live on British radio to protest alleged animal cruelty by the royal family / AFP This story is from our Performance artist woofs down a corgi A BRITISH performance artist ate a corgi live on radio overnight in a protest at alleged animal cruelty by the royal family. Mark McGowan, who once ate a swan in a performance art show, said the cooked canine - the Queen's favourite breed of dog - tasted "really, really, really disgusting''. Yoko Ono, who was also a guest on the Bob and Roberta Smith radio program broadcast on London-based arts station 104.4 Resonance FM, tasted the dog but "looked a bit strange'', McGowan said. The corgi, which died at a breeding farm, was minced with apple, onion and seasoning, the British Press Association reported. Before the show, the vegetarian and animal rights activist explained why he was protesting. "I know some people will find this offensive and tasteless but I am doing this to raise awareness about the RSPCA's inability to prosecute Prince Philip and his friends shooting a fox earlier this year, letting it struggle for life for five minutes and then beating it to death with a stick,'' he said. As McGowan, 37, ate the dog, he said: "It's disgusting. It's really, really really disgusting". "It's all wrong - it's really, really wrong. The protest, what Prince Philip done - it's all wrong.'' The show's presenter, Bob Smith, said he was not convinced the meal was corgi, but McGowan said he trusted the the two women who cooked the dog. "It's stinky, it's white-looking, it's not like any meat I've ever seen.'' The RSPCA said it had investigated the alleged incident involving Philip at the Queen's Sandringham estate in January and "found no evidence that an offence of causing unnecessary suffering had taken place''. "An independent post-mortem examination was carried out and found that the fox died from gunshot wounds - and no evidence of other injury or trauma was found.". Poorva Joshipura, director of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' European arm, said that while "the idea of eating a corgi will make many people lose their lunch ... certainly foxes who are hunted for so-called entertainment are no less capable of feeling fear and pain. "Most of the British public will agree that it is high time the royals joined the rest of us who live in the 21st century and are opposed to cruelty to animals.''

The Lebanese army says at least one soldier was killed in the latest round of fighting Thursday. There were also reports that the militants suffered casualties. At least 80 people have died in the 10 days of fighting at the refugee camp, including 34 government soldiers, at least 24 militants and some civilians. The Islamic militants have refused government demands to surrender. On Wednesday, the government charged 20 Fatah al-Islam militants with being terrorists. Lebanese judicial sources say all of those charged are in custody, and that all could face the death penalty if convicted. At least one of the militants charged is a Syrian.

Yesterday the University and College Union decided by 158 votes to 99 to circulate a motion to all its branches to discuss calls from Palestinian trade unions for a "comprehensive and consistent international boycott of all Israeli academic institutions". The motion is going to branches for "their information and discussion". But the decision taken at the inaugural UCU national conference in Bournemouth was condemned by the Russell group of research-led universities, the National Union of Students and organisations with an interest in Israel and academic free speech. In a hard-hitting statement, the Russell group "rejected outright" the boycott call. Its chairman, Prof Malcolm Grant, who is also president and provost of University College London, said: "It is a contradiction in terms and in direct conflict with the mission of a university. "It betrays a misunderstanding of the academic mission, which is founded squarely on freedom of inquiry and freedom of speech. "Any institution worthy of the title of university has the responsibility to protect these values, and it is particularly disturbing to find an academic union attacking academic freedom in this way." Prof Grant promised that its universities "will uphold academic freedom by standing firm against any boycott that threatens it". Meanwhile, the executive director of the International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom (IAB), Ofir Frankel, accused the union of allowing itself "to act as a one-sided player in Middle Eastern politics". He said: "The IAB is amazed that the extremists that led their union to such an initiative decided not to discuss the option to pass this initiative to a vote of all 120,000 members, a decision that could have allowed the majority to rescue their union from this discriminatory action by reharnessing the values of academic freedom, discourse and debate, as their own general secretary suggested." The chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, Jeremy Newmark, described the union's decision as "an assault on academic freedom" that "damages the credibility of British academia as a whole". He called for the union to organise a full membership ballot before introducing any boycott. The decision by the UCU was also condemned by the Academic Friends of Israel, which accused the union of having "failed to support the wishes of its membership". Criticism of the UCU decision also came from student organisations. The president of the National Union of Students, Gemma Tumelty, said it did not support the principles behind an academic boycott of Israel because it "undermines the Israeli academics who support Palestinian rights". It also "hinders the building of bridges between Israelis and Palestinians". She added: "Retaining dialogue on all sides will be crucial in obtaining a lasting peace in the Middle East. International academics have a lot to offer higher education students in the UK and a boycott of this specific country is extremely worrying. "We will express our concerns to UCU and we are awaiting clarification from them on the exact nature of this policy and its potential impact on students and the academic community." There were also reservations about the UCU decision from the World Union of Jewish Students. Its chairwoman, Tamar Shchory, a student at Ben Gurion University in south Israel, said: "In campuses abroad the climate of hostility towards the state of Israel and Jewish students is getting stronger. "It seems like the UCU has chosen a one-sided, not constructive, position in a very complex and sensitive matter instead of promoting the basic value of academic freedom and constructive initiatives."

Speaking a week before he meets leaders of the Group of Eight (G-8) industrial nations in Germany, Putin said Russia's tests on Tuesday of a two new missiles were a direct response to U.S. moves to create a missile defense system. "We are not the initiators of this new round of the arms race," Putin told a joint Kremlin news conference with visiting Greek President Karolos Papoulias. "There is no need to fear Russia's actions: they are not aggressive," he said. "They are a mere response to harsh and groundless unilateral actions by our partners and are aimed at maintaining the balance of forces in the world." Putin's comments, which will be popular among ordinary Russians in a year when there is a parliamentary election, are the latest in a line of harsh outbursts against the West. Russia on Tuesday test-fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile with multiple warheads and a new cruise missiles, which Russian generals say are sufficient to ensure the country's security for the next 40 years. "Our partners are stuffing eastern Europe with new weapons," Putin said. "What are we supposed to do? We cannot just observe all this." Moscow has been alarmed by U.S. plans to deploy elements of its global missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Washington says it wants to avert attacks from "rogue states" such as Iran but Russia sees a threat to its own security. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Story published at magicvalley.com on Thursday, May 31, 2007 Last modified on Thursday, May 31, 2007 6:45 AM MDT In this photo released by the Palestinian Authority, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, right, and Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, left, meet in Gaza City, Wednesday, May 30, 2007. (AP Photo/Abd Alhalim Abu Askar, Palestinian Authority,HO) Abbas, Olmert to Try to Mend Cease-Fire GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip - The Israeli and Palestinian leaders will meet next week in the Palestinian territories for the first time in a bid to restore a shattered cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, a senior Palestinian official said Thursday. The announcement came amid a slowdown in violence after two weeks of fighting between Palestinian rocket squads and Israeli forces. The fighting is expected to dominate the agenda of next week's meeting between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. "The president is working night and day for a mutual, comprehensive cease-fire," said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a top aide to Abbas. Abu Rdeneh said next week's summit, scheduled for Thursday, "is expected in the Palestinian territories." Officials would not say where, but in the past they have mentioned the West Bank oasis of Jericho as the likely venue. While the two leaders have held a series of meetings over the past year, the Palestinians haven't hosted any of the gatherings. Olmert's spokeswoman, Miri Eisin, said a West Bank meeting is "a possibility," but said the date and location still have not been finalized. Olmert and Abbas promised Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice back in March to meet every two weeks with the aim of moving beyond day-to-day issues and begin discussing the outlines of a final peace agreement. However, the men have met just once since then, in April, and next week's talks will focus on the fighting. A five-month truce in Gaza unraveled earlier this month when the Hamas militant group began firing barrages of rockets into southern Israel, prompting Israel to respond with a series of airstrikes. More than 50 Palestinians, most of them militants, and two Israeli civilians have been killed. In the latest violence, Israeli aircraft attacked a Palestinian rocket-launching squad in northern Gaza Thursday. No injuries were reported. "We will actively pursue and hit these rocket launchers as well as those who operate them," said David Baker, an official in Olmert's office. Despite the flareup, there were signs of a slowdown in fighting. Hamas' military wing, which has been responsible for most of the recent rocket fire, said it has not launched a projectile in 48 hours. "Perhaps there is an unannounced cease-fire," Abu Rdeneh said. The smaller Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for Thursday's rocket fire. In a separate incident, Islamic Jihad said two members were slightly injured in an Israeli artillery strike. But the army denied involvement. Still, the number of rocket attacks has sharply dropped in recent days. Israel resolved on Wednesday to keep striking Gaza rocket squads and said it wasn't negotiating a truce with radical groups. Israeli officials believe the Israeli air campaign is the reason for the reduced rocket fire. Abbas, a moderate who favors peacemaking, has been pushing Hamas to restore the Gaza cease-fire. But he has been ineffective in halting militant attacks. Abbas' Fatah movement and Hamas are partners in the Palestinian coalition government. That partnership is extremely fragile, however, and Hamas began attacking Israel in an apparent attempt to halt a fresh wave of Palestinian infighting. Abbas has proposed a truce agreement that would commit Gaza militants to halt their rocket fire for a month to permit negotiations on a more comprehensive cease-fire including the West Bank. Militants have said a truce is out of the question as long as Israel keeps up its attacks and refuses to bring a truce to the West Bank, where it frequently conducts arrest raids. Israel has so far rejected the notion of applying the truce to West Bank, especially in light of the latest round of attacks from Gaza. Meanwhile, Hamas and Fatah are expected to meet next week to discuss shoring up an internal truce called after this month's infighting, which killed more than 50 Palestinians, said a senior Egyptian security official. Both sides have sent representatives to Cairo to individually speak to Egyptian mediators about the reasons for the latest outbreak in fighting, and the possibilities of coming to a truce with Israel. The two sides are expected to agree to form a committee that will include an impartial Egyptian observer to call judgment on violations of the truce currently holding between Palestinians, said Lt. Col. Burhan Hamad, head of the Gaza-based Egyptian security delegation. "But it's not a guarantee against fighting," Burhan warned. Although the internal truce has mostly held, mistrust runs deep. Both sides have welcomed Egyptian involvement. "We want to get out of mutual accusations through the refereeing of a third party, trusted by both sides, and that is the Egyptians," said Mohammed Dahlan, a Fatah strongman in Gaza, speaking on an Arab news television station on Thursday.

Taliban attacks kill 16 Afghan policemen KABUL, May 31, 2007 (AFP) - A Taliban ambush killed 16 policemen in Afghanistan Thursday as the NATO-led force said a chopper that came down in the south, killing seven foreign soldiers, may have been struck by hostile fire. Afghan officials announced meanwhile that at least a dozen Taliban fighters lost their lives in incidents overnight, and bombing raids in the southern province of Helmand were believed to have killed and wounded several more. The attack on the police was one of the deadliest on the fledgling force, which is regularly hit by ambushes and roadside bombs in an insurgency led by the extremist Taliban movement that was driven from government in 2001. A three-vehicle police convoy was on its way from the south to the capital, Kabul, when it was ambushed along the main highway -- one of the busiest in the country, the interior ministry said. "Sixteen police were martyred and another six police were wounded today at 8:30 am in an ambush by the enemies of peace in Afghanistan," spokesman Zemarai Bashary told AFP. There were also casualties on the Taliban side, Bashary said, without giving a number. NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said in Kabul meanwhile that a Chinook that came down in Helmand late Wednesday may have been hit by hostile fire. The Taliban movement said its men shot down the chopper. "We are able to say now that there may have been enemy fire in bringing down the helicopter," the ISAF media office in Kabul said. "It could be anything from small arms fire upwards." The 37-nation force does not release the nationalities of its casualties, but the Ministry of Defence announced in London that one of the seven dead was a British soldier. The icasualties.org website, which charts casualties in the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, said five of the dead were US nationals, but this was not confirmed by the US military here. Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi said late Wednesday that "our brothers in Helmand" had brought down the heavy transport helicopter. "The helicopter burst into flames in the sky and then crashed," he said, citing the local rebel cell that claimed to have to carried out the attack. The insurgents have made similar claims in the past but are only confirmed to have brought down one military aircraft in Afghanistan -- in June 2005 when a rocket-propelled grenade shot down a Chinook in Kunar province. All 16 soldiers on board, eight of them US Navy SEALs, were killed. The defence ministry said meanwhile that Afghan and ISAF soldiers became involved in heavy fighting in Helmand early Thursday. "Tens of enemy elements have been killed and wounded," it said in a statement. "Various enemy locations were bombed by the air forces and the operation is still ongoing." Hardcore Taliban are said to be allied with drugs barons and foreign fighters in Helmand, the top producer of Afghanistan's illegal opium. The province is where the Afghan and foreign military forces said they killed the Taliban's top military commander, Mullah Dadullah, this month in the military's biggest success against the movement. The rebels have vowed to avenge the commander's death. Separately the district centre in western Farah province, which is on the Iranian border, came under "heavy attack by enemies of peace and sovereignty" overnight, the interior ministry said Thursday. Police returned fire, killing 10 rebels and injuring 15, it said. And in the southern province of Kandahar, two Taliban insurgents fell victim to one of their own bombs when the device exploded as they were planting it, Panjwayi district governor Niaz Mohammad Sarhadi said.

Greek President Carolos Papoulias is on an official visit to Russia. MOSCOW- President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that tests of new Russian missiles were a response to the planned deployment of U.S. missile defense installations and other forces in Europe, suggesting Washington has triggered a new arms race. In a clear reference to the United States, he harshly criticized "imperialism" in global affairs and warned that Russia will strengthen its military potential to maintain a global strategic balance. "It wasn't us who initiated a new round of arms race," Putin said when asked about Russia's missile tests at a news conference after talks in the Kremlin with Greek President Karolos Papoulias. Putin described Tuesday's tests of a new ballistic missile capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads and a new cruise missile as part of the Russian response to the planned deployment of new U.S. military bases and missile defense sites in ex-Soviet satellites in Central and Eastern Europe. He assailed the United States and other NATO members for failing to ratify an amended version of the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, which limits the deployment of heavy non-nuclear weapons around the continent. "We have signed and ratified the CFE and are fully implementing it. We have pulled out all our heavy weapons from the European part of Russia to (locations) behind the Ural Mountains and cut our military by 300,000 men," Putin said. "And what about our partners? They are filling Eastern Europe with new weapons. A new base in Bulgaria, another one in Romania, a (missile defense) site in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic," he said. "What we are supposed to do? We can't just sit back and look at that." Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly rejected U.S. assurances that the planned missile defense installations are meant to counter a potential threat from nations such as Iran and pose no danger to Russia. Putin reaffirmed his warning that Russia would opt out of the CFE treaty altogether if NATO nations fail to ratify its amended version. "Either you ratify the treaty and start observing it, or we will opt out of it," Putin said. In remarks clearly directed against Washington, Putin blasted those "who want to dictate their will to all others regardless of international norms and law." "It's dangerous and harmful," he added. "Norms of the international law were replaced with political expediency. We view it as diktat and imperialism." Russia this week initiated an international conference to be held in Austria in early June to discuss the situation around the CFE treaty. Putin described the tests of new missiles conducted by Russia on Tuesday as a necessary response to the Western action. "There is no reason to fear these actions by Russia, they aren't aggressive. It's merely a response to tough and unfounded unilateral actions by our partners," he said. "These actions are aimed at preserving a global balance." In one missile test Tuesday, a prototype of new Russia's intercontinental ballistic missile, called the RS-24, was fired from a mobile launcher at the Plesetsk launch site in northwestern Russia and its test warhead landed on target 3,400 miles away on the Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, officials said. Russia's military also tested a new cruise missile based on the existing short-range Iskander missile. "We will keep modernizing our potential," Putin said.

Speaking at a news conference after meeting with the Greek president in the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin said Russia did not initiate the new wave of an international arms race, and condemned the planned deployment of a U.S. missile shield in Europe, and the development of new military bases on the continent. "There is no need to fear Russia&#39;s actions, they are not aggressive... They are aimed at maintaining balance in the world order, and are extremely important for maintaining peace and security globally," Putin said. Russia conducted successful tests this week of a new ballistic missile with MIRV and a cruise missile allegedly capable of penetrating any operational and future missile defenses. "We conducted a test of a new strategic ballistic missile with multiple warheads, and of a new cruise missile, and will continue to improve our resources," Putin said. The president suggested recently that Moscow might suspend its obligations under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty if talks with NATO countries on its implementation show no visible progress. No NATO members have yet ratified the re-drafted CFE pact, demanding that Russia first withdraw from Soviet-era bases in Georgia and Moldova under previous agreements. Russia, concerned over Europe&#39;s refusal to ratify the re-drafted version of the accord, and acceptance by certain EU states of U.S. missile shield plans on the continent, proposed on Monday holding an emergency CFE conference in Vienna on June 12-15. "We are fully observing the provisions of the [CFE] treaty and have pulled out all heavy weaponry from the European part of Russia. We have reduced our armed forces by 300,000 personnel in the past few years, but what about our partners?" Putin said. "They are inundating eastern Europe with new weapons - a new base in Bulgaria, another base in Romania, a [missile interceptor] site in Poland, a radar in the Czech Republic," the president said. "What are we supposed to do? We cannot just observe all this and continue to keep our obligations under the treaty." Putin also stressed that the United States unilaterally withdrew from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, paving the way to the deployment of its missile shield in Europe. "Our American partners have left the ABM Treaty," he said. "We warned them then that we would take measures in response, to maintain the global strategic balance." The U.S. plans to deploy a missile defense radar in the Czech Republic and 10 interceptor missiles in Poland as part of its European missile shield allegedly against "rogue" states, such as Iran and North Korea. Since Washington announced the plans earlier this year, Russia has vehemently opposed the deployment, citing its own national security concerns. Some of Russia&#39;s top generals hinted that the bases, if opened, could be targeted by Russian missiles.

Youths demanding contracts from Shell stormed the Bomu pipeline complex, which is a major artery feeding the Bonny crude export terminal, prompting the partial shutdown of the Trans-Niger pipeline on Tuesday, a company spokesman said. "Youths from the K-Dere community started to spoil the environment by opening some pressure indicator valves. Consequently, we had to shut in some of the oil production," he said. Shell said it had already begun to restore some of the lost production, but would not specify how much. The same protesters, from the Ogoni area of the anarchic Niger Delta, had attacked the same pipeline hub on May 10 and occupied it for six days, forcing a 170,000 bpd closure. "We are angry at Shell because they failed to honour the agreement we have with them to give us contracts. If they give us the contracts now we will vacate the premises immediately and open the lines," said Teddy Penedibebari, one of the protesters. He said K-Dere youths had been promised contracts worth 50 million naira ($393,000) but this could not be confirmed from other sources. Shell suspended production in Ogoni 14 years ago because of popular protests, but the area is still criss-crossed by pipelines and many residents are still aggrieved about oil spills and what they see as a history of neglect. Shell had only just resumed normal production levels at its 400,000 bpd Bonny terminal before Tuesday's attack on Bomu. Exports remained under a force majeure, a legal measure exempting Shell from its contractual export obligations. The latest disruption brings to 845,000 bpd, or one-third of capacity, the volume of oil production shut by a wave of unrest in Nigeria, the world's eighth largest oil exporter. The country's new President Umaru Yar'Adua, who took office on Tuesday, said he would urgently address the crisis in the oil-producing Niger Delta. Militants fighting for regional control over the region's wealth have promised to release six hostages on Wednesday as a sign of their readiness to talk. About 25 foreigners are being held captive.

Meanwhile, US forces backed by helicopter gunship clashed with suspected Al-Qaeda gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. At least 10 policemen were among the dead in the Fallujah attack, which occurred about 11 am, according to police officials. Fallujah, in restive Anbar province, is 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated his explosives vest at the third of four checkpoints as he stood among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only been opened on Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The US military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of tribes that have banded together to fight Al-Qaeda. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of insurgents and Al-Qaeda through the course of the Iraq war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents there called for US help. Members of Al-Qaeda were preventing students from attending final examinations, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. Clashes continued into Thursday afternoon, and the council official said the Al-Qaeda leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the US military. US forces, meanwhile, pressed on Thursday with the search for five kidnapped Britons. A procession of mourners marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a US helicopter strike before dawn. The US military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the attack. It came in the second day of a search for the Britons who were abducted from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad on Tuesday. A US military statement, however, said US forces had arrested two members of a secret cell network on Thursday in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. A police officer in Sadr City said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 am, killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was injured. Also in Sadr City raids, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi said his home was raided and ransacked by US forces at 3 am Thursday. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. The Britons were snatched from a Finance Ministry facility in a mock police raid. The US military late Wednesday reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed in a roadside bombing and one who died of a non-combat cause. Their deaths rose to 119 the number of soldiers killed this month, the third-deadliest month of the war for US troops. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. An Al-Qaeda front group has claimed responsibility. Residents gather near a burnt vehicle after an airstrike by US forces in Baghdad's Sadr City.

The London-based billionaire businessman told the Financial Times that he was helping finance the Other Russian Coalition after launching his latest attack on Mr Putin and the alleged involvement of the Russian state in the murder in London of Alexander Litvinenko. Russian authorities have claimed that Mr Berezovsky was linked to the opposition coalition, which has seen demonstrations forcibly broken up in Moscow and St Petersburg. But Garry Kasparov, the former chess champion and one of the coalition leaders, has denied that Mr Berezovsky was funding the group. Mr Kas-parov told the FT last month that the coalition did "not have any contacts with those who might jeopardise our reputation", and later told BBC Radio any suggestion of a link with the former Russian oligarch was "a lie". Mr Berezovsky's claim may be used by the Kremlin as ammunition in its attempts to portray Other Russia as a marginal and extremist group. Mr Berezovsky urged Britain and the international community to impose sanctions on Russia if the Kremlin persisted in its refusal to extradite to the UK Andrei Lugovoi, whom British prosecutors have named as the prime suspect in the murder of Mr Litvinenko. "Whether Lugovoi is put on trial should not depend on Russia. It depends on how strong Britain is prepared to be," Mr Berezovsky said. "[Action] should be based on an understanding that Russia is a danger to the west . . . I am talking about collective international action, about sanctions." Mr Berezovsky's comments, made at an event organised on Tuesday night by the London lecture group Miller's Academy, are likely to fuel the Kremlin's anger over Britain's refusal to withdraw his refugee status. "It is absolutely clear that Russia needs a revolution . . . What kind of revolution is going to happen in Russia? The most probable is the elites no longer accepting the way the country is being led . . . when people recognise that it is probably dangerous to remain in the system and they look for an alternative." Mr Berezovsky, who des-cribed the Putin regime as a "kind of dictatorship", insis-ted nothing of what he was saying breached the terms of his asylum status in the UK and that there was "no chance whatsoever" of the British government agreeing a deal whereby he might be exchanged for Mr Lugovoi. Mr Lugovoi has denied that he was involved in the murder of Mr Litvinenko.

Best Meals in Asia L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon 15 Queen&rsquo;s Road Central Once a Muslim, Always a Muslim in Malaysia The country&rsquo;s highest court rules that a Kuala Lumpur woman can&rsquo;t convert to Christianity Doing the Impossible: Quitting Islam in Malaysia Malaysia&rsquo;s highest court ruled today in a split decision that a Kuala Lumpur woman who renamed herself Lina Joy has lost her 12-year fight to legally become a Christian. According to Malaysian law, Joy will remain a Muslim whether she wants to or not, and her religious status will remain on her identity card. Justice Richard Malanjun, a Christian, dissented in the ruling. The outcome of the case was hardly unexpected, given Malaysia&#39;s religious and ethnic history. A crowd of about 300 Muslims waited outside, reading the Koran and chanting as Federal Court Chief Justice Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim delivered the judgment to a packed courtroom in the administrative capital Putrajaya, saying that jurisdiction over Joy&rsquo;s case remains with Malaysia&rsquo;s syariah, or religious court. As the decision was being read, the shout &ldquo;Allahu Akhbar&rdquo; resounded through the Palace of Justice. Joy, 43, remains a recluse, fearing retaliation in Malaysia&rsquo;s always edgy religious and ethnic atmosphere. She cannot legally marry her non-Muslim partner, a cook, because the law requires non-Muslims to convert to Islam if they wish to marry someone of that faith. She has not spoken to the press since her case became public. She converted to Christianity when she was 26. In 1999, although Joy succeeded in getting officials to change her name on her MyKad, a national identification card that must state the bearer&rsquo;s religion, she was unsuccessful in having the word Islam removed. That was what brought her to the federal court, which considered three questions: Whether syriah court certification was needed before the National Registration Department could change the religious affiliation on Joy&#39;s ID card, whether the NRD correctly construed its powers when it imposed the above requirement, which is not expressly provided for in the regulations and most importantly, whether the syriah courts&#39; authority took precedence over the civil courts in cases where Muslims renounced their faith. Although the case was decided nearly a year ago, the federal court delayed its public ruling, partly because of the thorny legal issues and the question of whether the country&rsquo;s federal courts should defer to syariah law. Despite the fact that Malaysia is largely a moderate Islamic country, only about 60 percent of its citizens are Muslims, existing in an uneasy balance with the mostly Chinese Christian, Buddhist or Taoist minority who make up about 25 percent of the population. Indians and other minorities make up another 11 percent. Authorities earlier this week were urging calm, as were Muslim religious leaders. The victory in court should defuse any further concerns, although Christian opponents were expected to be holding silent vigils and issuing statements. The reform organization Aliran issued a statement saying that: " The freedom of religion guaranteed by the Federal Constitution under Article 11 comes across as hollow and meaningless. This decision has totally rendered null and void the freedom of religion guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. Under the circumstances, the Federal Court&rsquo;s decision has a devastating effect on issues of fairness and justice. Concerned citizens will rightly wonder whether the judiciary is capable of delivering justice for those who turn to it. They will be turned away from the judicial system of the country thinking that the judges who are sworn to uphold the Federal Constitution in the course of their duty are not living up to their oath of office." It is not possible to be an ethnic Malay in Malaysia without being a Muslim. Apostasy or conversion is a punishable offence in most states, either with a fine or a jail sentence or both. Muslims dominate most of the public institutions and have done so since bloody 1969 riots that officially killed 192 persons on both sides of the ethnic divide, but are presumed to have killed hundreds more Despite the fact that one clause of the country&rsquo;s original federal constitution guarantees freedom of religion, another, added later, states that &ldquo;State law and in respect of the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur and Labuan, federal law may control or restrict the propagation of any religious doctrine or belief among persons professing the religion of Islam." Generally, the government has sought to stay out of the issue and has referred questions over apostasy or conversion to the country&rsquo;s syariah. Not surprisingly, the syariah courts have ruled unanimously that ethnic Malays must remain Islamic. Malaysia, however, is on an increasingly secular path on all sides of the ethnic and religious divide. On a breakneck path to modernization for the past 25 years, urban citizens of all ethnic groups have become more secular, with young Malays adopting miniskirts, jeans and all the accoutrements that go with modern lifestyles. Religious and government leaders have watched that with increasing concern. Accordingly &ndash; and especially with the departure of former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, an authoritarian figure who largely kept ethnic concerns isolated -- official Islam is stiffening its resistance. The syariah courts have particularly refused to budge on any issues involving a change of religion. One woman, Kamariah Ali, who joined a sect and publicly renounced Islam in 1999, was ordered jailed in 2005 on charges of &ldquo;insulting Islam.&rdquo; Then, last year, a mountaineering hero and Army corporal named Manyan Moorthy died of cancer and was buried in a Muslim cemetery with Muslim rites despite the fact that his wife insisted he had never converted. The civil High Court ruled that it could not overrule the syariah court that had declared him a Muslim. Religious tensions have occasionally flared. Last November, Muslims gathered outside a Catholic church in Ipoh after text messages that the church was preparing to baptize a group of Malays, including a celebrated yachtsman, Azhar Mansor, who had sailed around the world single-handedly in 1999 without an engine. Azhar, who no longer lives in Malaysia, is widely believed to be a quietly practicing Christian although he has denied it. Although the SMS proved to be false, authorities were forced to move in to forestall violence. Unverified accusations of mass conversions into Christianity by Malays have been swirling in the press and blogs, further stoking the fire. The attorney general&rsquo;s chambers announced recently that it was considering establishing a commission to study religious-sensitive cases like Joy&rsquo;s, said Minister in the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Department Nazri Abdul Aziz. The commission, if it comes to into existence, is expected to include religious leaders of all faiths. The government wants a system in which disputes such as conversion, especially when it involves children, can be addressed in an &lsquo;extra legal manner.&#39; The most recent incident that has gripped Malaysians and make international headlines is the forced separation of a Muslim woman, Siti Fatimah, from her husband, Suresh Veerapan, who contended that Siti was no longer a Muslim and in fact a practicing Hindu born to Muslim parents, and that her name is actually Revathi Masoosai. Islamic religious officials charged Siti Fatimah with committing apostasy and ordered for her sent to a &lsquo;rehabilitation&rsquo; center for almost 100 days. Her detention was extended another 80 days in April. In an interview with the television network Al Jazeera, Siti Fatimah&rsquo;s mother said she would raise the couple&rsquo;s 15-month-old granddaughter as a Muslim. ... : senior citizen Regarding the "spread of Islam by the sword", I would like to point out that in the 50's, PAS(or PIMP, at that time), had a policy of "the sword or the koran"; this was the 6th tenet of Islam. This did not gain favour with the rest of Malaya, including UMNO. Over time, esp with Dr M, the idea of "muslim superiority and malay superiority" began to take root. This, I believe, was because Dr M realised the the NEP was failing. The only way to galvanise the Malays now was the introduction of something with strong emotional and religious overtones which can roughshord over more important issues/values like self reliance, hard workingness,sense of achievement etc. Hence you see now in Malaysia, the obsecession with Muslim dress code, "indecent" behaviour in public, covering of the face with a veil. All the deviant Muslim sects, have one common feature: obsession with sex. Think I am conning you? Go and check it out for yourself. Malay achievments in any field of human activity requiring intelligence and hard work is abysmal. Of course, there are the odd one out. I know, because I teach postgraduates. The examination I prepare them for is prepared overseas, with visiting examiners. Inevitably Malay candidates want to know one thing. Does the government have any input in the examination. There is none - hence few Malays sit for this examination. The NEP has destroyed the core values of the Malays. Dr M is the man who did it. But the Malays don't see it. To them, Dr M is the man who will lead them to "malay superiority and muslim superiority". Dr M has done what the Jews want to done to Muslims, i.e. destroy them in the core. The whole psyche will then collapse; but the Malays will not know it, because they have not learned to use their brains to work out their problems. Frog Under The Coconut Shell : To Hell With This Lazy Facist The Malays are one of the most pathetic racial groups in the world. Virtually devoid of any measureable achievements, through hard sweat & toil of course & not those which money can procure (like the Petronas Twin Towers), to speak of, whether in science, technology, sports, economy & host of other human endeavours, it is utterly surprising that these people still persist to imagine that their country is still god-zone & paradise! While others (like Vietnam & Thailand)in S.E.Asia are busy finding their niche in a globalised world in building up their countries, the Malays squander their time & energies shadow boxing over virtually insignificant issues like race, religion, how much left to further wrest from the the more productive non-Malays etc (instead of wealth creation, they are more interested in the share of wealth others create). &#013;&#010;There is a buzz word amongst the foreign expat community - whatever the Malays touches, the object will invariably turn from `gold' to `coal'. This amply describes how lowly the Malays are generally regarded! There was even one article by an Australian by the name of Michael Backman who ridiculed the much hyped slogan `M'sia Boleh' as `M'sia Bodoh'. &#013;&#010;Of course, these negative insinuations are not made out of the blues. Just pause & look back at their mega blunders through the years - Proton, Perwaja, Bank Bumi, UMBC Bank, Bakun Dam, MSC, Kuantan Port, Airport (in terms of throughput), Tertiary Education (University ranking), school systems (national schools being turned into Islamic madrassas), crumbling civil service, MAS etc....& the list is endless. There was an interview by Aljeeera (Arabic TV Channel) on Dr Mahathir before he retired in which the Arab commentator rightly commented that all the visible signs of modernity in M'sia are virtually built single-handedly by the Chinese & Indians without any input from the Malays! These people are therefore mere modern day nuts! &#013;&#010;Look further at these vivid comparisons with tiny S'pore(which incidentally shares a common history with M'sia): &#013;&#010;.Per Capital Income - 1967, at par with M'sia; 2007, almost US$ 40000 vs US$5000 (in S'pore's favour) &#013;&#010;.GDP growth - 8% VS 5.6% &#013;&#010;.Exchange Rate - 1967, 1:1; 1970's, 1:1.1 (in Ringgit's favour); 2007, 2.3:1 (in S$'s favour) &#013;&#010;.S'pore became `developed status' in 2000, M'sia aspires to be one by 2020 (mere wishful thinking? God knows this will ever materialise!) &#013;&#010;.S'pore's economical fundamentals sucessfully restructured to becoming service, financial, biotech, hitech oriented; M'sia still struggling to find her niche &#013;&#010;.Immigration policy - S'pore throws her door wide open to skilled immigrants; M'sia still sings the bumiputra protectionist tunes! &#013;&#010;. lots of other examples too lengthy to elaborate &#013;&#010;It's time these Malays wake up instead of shouting Allahu Akhbar. Your Allah cannot win you any progress or meal on your table but will bring bombs, death, destruction from the Christian West! It would be really lovely to imagine a future scenario where there will be no Chinese & Indians left in M'sia, where M'sia will likely decend into a medievil feudal state. By then, the Malays will still find themselves marginalised because they still cannot compete with their more hardworking brethrens from Indonesia! What an aweful twisted irony! Misrepresenting facts to demonise Islam : Lotfi This is typical of outsiders trying to misrepresent facts to demonise Islam. &#010;This case is NOT about Lina's right to convert. Nobody can stop what's in her heart; for all that matter she has already left Islam anyway. &#010;The issue at stake is, administratively, who has the power to change the details on her identity card. The Constitution states that ALL issues pertaining to Islam falls under the jurisdiction of the Shari'ah courts, not the High courts. The former is not subordinated to the latter, but runs parallel to it. &#010;If she wants to register her conversion, then she should seek the judgement from the Shari'ah courts, not the High Court. She refuses to do so, making a big deal of the matter, whereas such courts have previously allowed such conversion e.g. the case of Nyonya Tahir. &#010;I believe the so-called human rights groups are not sincere in highlighting this issue, as evident by their misleading everyone about the real issues affected.

"Essentially, British trade unions are declaring war on Israel," Ronnie Fraser, director of the Academic Friends of Israel, told JTA. On Wednesday, the University and College Union stopped short of calling for an all-out boycott, but instead passed a motion to circulate Palestinian calls for an academic boycott of Israel to its branches “for information and discussion.” The motion, at the group's first gathering, passed by a vote of 158 to 99. In a statement, the union said the boycott motion means branches "have a responsibility" to consult all of their members on the issue. The Union represents 120,000 workers in higher education throughout the United Kingdom. The motion passed despite comments during the debate by the union's new general-secretary, Sally Hunt, who said, "I do not believe a boycott is supported by the majority of UCU members, nor do I believe that members see it is a priority for the union." The move is the latest of several British efforts to boycott Israel. Last month the National Union of Journalists passed a motion to boycott Israeli goods. More recently, a group of British doctors and a group of architects called for a boycott within their respective professions. The union also passed a motion to campaign for the restoration of all international aid to the Palestinian Authority and all revenues that the union says rightfully belong to the authority. Worldwide aid to the Palestinian Authority was stopped when Hamas took control of the government last year. Boycott opponents were outraged by the union's vote. Ofir Frankel, executive director of the International Advisory Board for Academic Freedom based at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, said the union “has allowed itself to act as a one-sided player in Middle Eastern politics. It is very disturbing to behold a form of singling out and discrimination happening in the U.K. -- the U.K. which upholds itself as the cradle of fairness, freedom of speech and academic debate.” Jeremy Newmark, chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, said that while the vast majority of academics do not support a boycott, “this decision damages the credibility of British academia as a whole.” In a statement, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations said, "These obscene resolutions have all the faults that academics normally deplore in their profession: a superficial and flawed understanding of the subject, clear bias, and antagonism to the open exchange of ideas." Supporters of the boycott efforts said Israeli universities deserve to be targeted because they are symbols of Israeli national identity. During the hourlong debate on the issue, Michael Cushman of the London School of Economics said, "Senior academics move from universities into ministries and back again. "Regularly, lecturers take up their commissions in the Israeli Defence Force as reserve officers to go into the West Bank to dominate, control and shoot the population," he said. In the British academic world, four previous efforts to introduce a boycott of Israeli academics since 2002 were scuttled. The University and College Union was created last June by the merger of the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, and the Association of University Teachers, the AUT, both of which had initiated their own boycott proposals. Motions were defeated by the AUT in 2003, and although a motion passed in 2005, it was overwhelmingly overturned at a special council of the union following international outcry. A boycott motion narrowly passed at the National Association conference in 2006, but the resolution expired with the merger of the unions. According to the new boycott motion passed this week, "Israel's 40-year occupation has seriously damaged the fabric of Palestinian society through annexation, illegal settlement, collective punishment and restriction of movement." In an effort to counter the boycott, a group of Arab and Jewish Israeli students hosted a stand at the conference to detail academic cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs and between Israel and the United Kingdom, all of which they said could be affected by the boycott. They also talked to delegates about the achievements of Israeli universities and showcased the projects between Israeli and Palestinian universities, as well as the joint work benefiting Israel's Arab minority, that is threatened by the proposed boycott. "The stall allows Israeli students to show that a boycott is counterproductive and will hurt the very relationships that will help bring peace in the Middle East," said Frankel of the International Advisory Board, which sponsored the stand. "We also want to take this opportunity to build links with British academics that may advance these valuable projects." The board was established by Bar-Ilan University in 2005 with the Academic Friends of Israel to respond to calls for boycotts of Israeli academics, fight anti-Israel policies of the British education unions and anti-Semitic incidents on university campuses. The stall was supported by the Fair Play Campaign Group, part of the Board of Deputies of British Jews' campaign to combat boycott initiatives, to promote cooperation and dialogue in the Middle East, and by the British Friends of Israeli Universities. Along with the Israeli students, a delegation of senior Israeli academics conducted a week of meetings with British counterparts, parliamentarians and journalists in an effort to combat the boycott call. With the delegation was Miriam Shlesinger, a professor at Bar-Ilan University and a victim of a boycott in 2002. She was removed from the board of a journal at Manchester University on the basis of her Israeli citizenship. "A boycott against Israel is discriminatory and will achieve no useful purpose," Shlesinger said. "Many academics like myself are acting on behalf of the causes that the UCU and others espouse, except that by deterring us from doing this they are achieving the exact opposite." Also last week, Steven Weinberg, a University of Texas professor and Nobel laureate, canceled a visit to a London university citing the journalists' boycott and what he perceives to be "a widespread anti-Israel and anti-Semitic current in British opinion." In a letter to Imperial College he wrote: "I know that some will say that these boycotts are directed only against Israel rather than generally against Jews, but given the history of the attacks on Israel and the oppressiveness and aggressiveness of other countries in the Middle East and elsewhere, boycotting Israel indicated a moral blindness for which it is hard to find any explanation other than anti-Semitism."

You believe strongly that the occupation must end, that the Palestinians should have an independent state, that Israel's military and diplomatic policies are wrongheaded to the point of immorality. What to do? Simple. Find the one group within Israeli society which has consistently, vigorously and courageously campaigned against the occupation since its inception. Single them out for professional ruin. Do your best to get as many of their colleagues around the world to shun them. Yes, just as if you were in seventh grade and had decided to alleviate your own feelings of insecurity, inadequacy, panic and lack of requisite cool by cutting another victim from the middle school herd and lobbying your equally insecure colleagues to abuse the chosen victim. Choose your victim with care. Select the one group in Israel which has taken substantive physical, professional, legal and personal risks, which has defied the spirit of Israeli nationalism and the letter of Israeli law, in order to seek out Palestinians to search for equitable solutions. Select the one group which has, from the very beginning, spoken out eloquently for the rights of the Palestinians to self-determination, to freedom from Israeli domination, to freedom from disproportionate and often indiscriminate use of force, to freedom from social injustice. Decide that your moral vision fully empowers you to declare Israeli professors and other university and college faculty to be unworthy of practicing their calling. All of them. That is, perhaps, the real beauty of the British campaign to declare a quarantine over Israeli academics. You really must envy the U.K. far-left for its blindness. Its consummate inability to see more than one side, which is to say, its demonstrated refusal to see Jews as fellow human beings, is only exceeded by its exquisite sense of timing. No matter that in the whole of the 1991 Gulf war, Saddam Hussein managed to hit all of Israel with a total of 39 missiles, and that two weeks ago, Hamas sent 40 rockets into the Sderot area in the space of a single day. No matter that Sapir College, Israel's largest public college, has for years been a primary target of Qassam crews. No matter that in boycotting all Israeli academics on the basis of their being Israelis, the measure is patently racist, a grotesque reprise of the history of curbing academic freedom. No matter that Israeli Arab academics who are staunchly opposed to the occupation are vehement opponents of the boycott as well. No matter, even, that opposition to the boycott runs strong within the British University and College Union itself. In fact, all the more reason to press on. For the genuine elitist, the unpopularity of an opinion is the best assurance of its real value. Perhaps this is why the whole boycott campaign smacks of a uniquely far-left British brand of moral masturbation, a desperate, delusional, sterile, supremely self-contained form of non-activism that risks nothing even as it changes nothing. There must be some reason why no one in this world does condescension better than the British far-left. There must be some reason why the British far-left manages to satisfy itself with a uniquely public, uniquely self-congratulatory form of ideological self-abuse. Leftists abroad would do well to respect their Israeli counterparts for defying societal norms to work for the rights of people with whom their nation is at war. Perhaps the Israeli left deserves respect, as well, for having to do this while enduring the racist abuse of leftists abroad.

U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said it was time for Iran to abandon uranium enrichment work, but EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana acknowledged before he met Iran's top nuclear negotiator in Madrid it would be hard to clinch a deal. "It is time for Iran to change its tactics. The international community is united on what Iran should do and this is to suspend (enrichment of uranium for nuclear fuel)," Rice said during a visit to Vienna. Solana's meeting with Iran's Ali Larijani at a former hunting lodge on Madrid's outskirts looked like a last stab at easing a standoff over Iran's atomic activity before world powers sharpen U.N. sanctions. But no one held out hope for any breakthrough one month after the last inconclusive session between the two men, despite two sets of modest U.N. sanctions against Iran. "It is true that as time goes by, if the situation continues, probably the agreement will be more complicated," Solana said before the talks. "I will try to ... see if we can pave the way in order to get into formal negotiations." Major powers insist Iran stop enriching uranium as a confidence-building precondition for negotiations on trade and other benefits. Larijani on Wednesday ruled out a nuclear halt as demanded by the U.N. Security Council, offering only to assure its program is not a disguised bid for bombs as the West suspects. Iran says it only wants atomic power to generate electricity. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

The Cabinet-level talks _ the highest channel of dialogue between the former wartime foes _ come amid a heightening standoff over the North's refusal to implement a breakthrough disarmament deal reached in February.

VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article had pledged to close its Yongbyon reactor in exchange for economic aid and political concessions, it has yet to fulfill the promise. U.S. and Chinese diplomats were set to discuss the matter in Beijing on Wednesday, while South Korea pressed on the issue directly to the North in Seoul. "We stressed the necessity of implementing the agreement quickly," South Korean spokesman Ko Gyoung-bin said after morning talks between the North and South delegations. South Korea also proposed formally reopening cross-border rail service between the countries in phases, and "in a way that benefits both the South and the North," Ko said. Earlier this month, the two Koreas held a historic cross-border test train run on restored tracks, marking the first time trains crossed the border since rail links were cut early in the 1950-53 Korean War. Fighting ended with a cease-fire instead of a peace treaty, leaving the two Koreas technically in a state of war. In the morning session, North Korea mentioned neither the nuclear standoff nor the South's recent decision to delay promised rice aid shipments to the North _ a potential flash point in the negotiations. South Korea is delaying shipment of about 400,000 tons of rice, with delivery originally set to begin in late May, over the North's refusal to start dismantling its nuclear programs. Analysts had expected the rice shipments to be a sticking point and possibly to derail the inter-Korea talks, which are the 21st such meeting and are scheduled to run through Friday. North Korea scuttled similar talks last year after the South snubbed an earlier demand for rice shipments, citing concerns about the North's missile tests in July 2006. Since then, North Korea has tested its first atomic bomb and is accused of stonewalling on pledges to start dismantling its nuclear programs. On Wednesday, the North called on the South "to take responsible measures regarding acts that provoke the dialogue partner and endanger South-North relations," Ko said. The admonition referred to regular joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea, drills perennially criticized by the North. Ko said the North also stressed that inter-Korean issues should not be disrupted by "outside forces" _ a common reference to the U.S., which stations 28,000 troops in South Korea as a legacy of the Korean War. North Korea has been refusing to shut down its reactor until it receives funds from an account at a bank in the Chinese territory of Macau. The account was frozen when the U.S. blacklisted the bank in 2005. North Korea's $25 million at Macau's Banco Delta Asia was freed earlier this year, but Pyongyang has not withdrawn the money, apparently seeking to receive it through a bank wire transfer to prove the funds are now clean. The U.S. had alleged the funds were tied to money laundering and counterfeiting. The chief U.S. negotiator to North Korean nuclear talks arrived in on Wednesday to discuss new ways to resolve the long-running banking dispute. Any breakthrough could help smooth inter-Korean talks in Seoul. Christopher Hill told reporters in Indonesia on Tuesday the process would be "helped immeasurably" if North Korea began dismantling its nuclear reactor as agreed to with the United States and four other countries.

The latest deaths bring US casualties for the month to 119, the most since November 2004 when marines launched a full-scale invasion to retake the city of Fallujah in the volatile western Anbar province. April was also bloody for the US-led coalition, with 104 deaths. Taken together, the two past months have been the deadliest since the March 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. The news will increase pressure on US President George W. Bush, who has already seen domestic support for his war strategy fall to an all-time low and is facing calls to set a timetable for troops' withdrawal. Meanwhile, the hunt intensified for five Britons who were snatched at gunpoint from a finance ministry building in the capital earlier this week, in an abduction that has been blamed on Baghdad's Shi'ite militias.

Kate and Gerry McCann want to raise Madeleine's profile across Europe and plan to visit Berlin, Amsterdam and even Morocco over the next 10 days. On Wednesday they had an emotional meeting with Pope Benedict XVI, who blessed photograph of Madeleine and prayed for the family. The McCanns said they were spiritually uplifted by the visit and had found strength from the Pope's words. But Mr McCann said the visit had inspired mixed emotions because the only reason they were there was because their daughter was missing. "In other circumstances of course it would be the highlight for any Catholic to meet the Pope. It is tainted with the very marked realisation that our daughter is still missing." During their time in Rome they held a news conference and handed out missing posters translated into Italian. The family still have hope that Madeleine will be found safe and well. Mr McCann said: "We know that there could be a breakthrough at any time. We must believe and do believe that we can get Madeleine back with us." Mrs McCann said that they still had no plans to go back to the UK and could not even begin to contemplate such an idea. Madeleine was abducted as she slept in the family's holiday apartment in the Algarve town of Praia da Luz on May 3. &copy; Copyright Press Association Ltd 2007, All Rights Reserved.

(AP Photo/Michael Dinneen) Japan Argues to Hunt Minke Whales Last updated: Thursday, May 31, 2007 5:45 AM EDT ANCHORAGE, Alaska - Japan said Wednesday that the International Whaling Commission should allow four of its coastal communities to hunt minke whales because the tradition is so old that it qualifies as subsistence hunting. Japan's proposal at the annual meeting of the 77-nation commission started a long and contentious debate Wednesday, a day after the body allowed Alaska Natives to continue the subsistence hunts of bowhead whales through 2012. The issue is scheduled to be decided Thursday, the final day of the meeting. Joji Morishita, the alternate IWC commissioner for Japan, told delegates that the Japanese communities "have been living on this tradition for hundreds of years; it is part of their lives." Morishita said science cannot draw the line between small coastal whaling and aboriginal whaling. Japan for more than two decades has sought "community whaling" status, which would give it quotas similar to those allowing Alaska Natives and other indigenous groups to hunt the mammals. Japan already kills about a 1,000 whales a year and sells the meat under a scientific research provision allowed by the whaling commission, which enacted a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. The proposal was heard a day after the whaling commission allowed Alaska Natives to continue the subsistence hunts of bowhead whales through 2012. Morishita acknowledged Wednesday that if Japan's request is approved, some meat from the minke whales, a relatively small species, would be sold. "What's wrong with commerciality?" he said. "Even the media here is commercial. Why do people have to see only commercial whaling as evil?" Russia supports the proposal, with its delegation saying Japan's traditional whaling is likely twice as old as Arctic whaling. That contention is misleading, said Atsushi Ishii, an environmental studies professor at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan. Of the four communities, he said, only Taiji on the southeastern coast has a tradition of hunting right whales _ now under the commission moratorium _ dating back more than 100 years. Only later, around the World War II era, did the other three begin hunting species now banned, he said. However, a number of nations voiced strong opposition. New Zealand said the minke proposal is the type of commercial whaling banned by the 1986 ban. The U.S. delegation noted that 360 minke whales are already caught annually in the Sea of Japan and the North Pacific. Of that, 220 are for Japan's scientific research program and 140 are bycatch. Both the United States and New Zealand also have expressed outrage at Japan's plan to kill 50 humpback whales, an endangered species, as part of its science program. The two were among nations to successfully pass a symbolic resolution Wednesday calling for Japan to suspend all lethal aspects of the program conducted within the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, an area around Antarctica where commercial whaling is banned. Also Wednesday, Greenland failed to win consensus on a revised proposal to increase its aboriginal quota of minke whales. Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory, originally wanted to add bowhead and humpback whales to its hunt for the first time. Critics said the giant mammals have low reproduction cycles and should not be treated as menu items.

Ali Larijani arrived Wednesday evening in Madrid, the capital of Spain, for talks with Solana on the Iranian nuclear dossier. "We hope for a successful completion of the meeting and that it will open the way to direct negotiations on Iran&#39;s &#39;nuclear dossier,&#39;" said Akhmad Reza Khermand, spokesman for Iran&#39;s embassy in Madrid. He said Iran has rights and obligations under international law and with respect to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and that it will honor its obligations. But he said it also expects its rights to be honored. "The outcome of the current talks is in Solana&#39;s hands," he said. But Solana was quoted by diplomatic sources as saying he doubts the talks will be a success. "Solana is pessimistic about the outcome of the upcoming negotiations with Larijani, despite the good relations that exist between the two diplomats," the Spanish newspaper El Pais said in its online version Thursday. Larijani said Wednesday Iran is ready to provide the West with "all necessary guarantees" that it does not intend to create an atomic bomb, adding that the Islamic Republic has on numerous occasions proved it has no interest in acquiring nuclear weapons. He said that "Tehran is ready for other countries, for example France, to join talks on the Iranian nuclear dossier." Larijani and Solana last met in Ankara April 25-26, and there was some progress made at the talks in finding common ground on some issues. Iran failed to comply with a 60-day deadline to stop uranium enrichment imposed by the UN Security Council and has increased uranium enrichment, saying its nuclear program is aimed exclusively at power generation. Secretary General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Mohamed ElBaradei said last week it was too late to force Tehran to abandon its uranium enrichment plans and proposed introducing inspection measures instead to prevent a further expansion of the Iranian nuclear program. The United States has threatened Iran with further sanctions.

In a keynote speech in Johannesburg on the final leg of his farewell African tour as Britain's leader, Blair also said that Africa's leaders must get tough on authoritarian governments, such as those in Sudan and Zimbabwe. "Wealthy nations and Africa both face a choice ... Our challenge is to support the good. Africa's challenge is to eliminate the bad," Blair said in the speech. "Next week at the G8 (Group of Eight) Summit, leaders will show whether, having put Africa at the top of the global agenda, we have the perseverance and vision to see it through. I hope we have," the outgoing British leader said. Blair's visit came on the eve of the G8 summit scheduled for Germany, during which Chancellor Angela Merkel has vowed to press rich nations to fulfill aid pledges to Africa under a 2005 Blair initiative. "We need each G8 to be bolder on Africa than the last," Blair said. "If we give up, we will lose the chance in this continent, rich as it is though its people are often poor, for our values to take root." He said initiatives such as the new Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund, which will provide matching funds for commercially sustainable African business projects, showed that Africa and the West could be partners in development. Due to hand over power to finance minister Gordon Brown on June 27, Blair is using the trip to build momentum for the summit, which will focus on the world's poorest continent and push for a world trade deal. On Thursday he paid a courtesy call on South Africa's 88-year-old former President Nelson Mandela, who jokingly welcomed him into retirement. "Tony, I look forward to welcoming a young man like you to the club of retired presidents and prime ministers," a smiling Mandela said in a brief appearance in Johannesburg.

Yesterday, Kate and Gerry McCann took it as high as they could on this earth. In front of 35,000 people in St Peter's Square in Rome, Pope Benedict XVI joined them in prayer for the safe return of their missing daughter, Madeleine. Their 30-second meeting was a bestowal of hope and a test of faith that the four- year-old, abducted from the family's holiday apartment in Portugal 28 days ago, would come home. The couple, both devout Catholics, shed tears at times during the general audience prior to their face-to-face meeting with the Pope. There was a symbolic moment only God could have arranged when a Red Admiral butterfly landed on the yellow ribbon in Mrs McCann's hair. It flew off but came back again to settle on her lapel - "really strange but lovely, like a symbol of hope," she said later. When the couple met the Pope he prayed with both of them, while Mr McCann bowed and kissed his hand. Looking solemnly at the couple, he leaned forward to bless a photograph of Madeleine, which he appeared to recognise immediately. Mr McCann said afterwards: "It was more personal than I could ever imagine it could have been. "His touch, words and thoughts were more tender than we could have thought. It was as though time stood still." His wife added: "It was very emotional but it was a very positive experience really, it has been very helpful to us. "He was very kind, he said he would pray for us and our family and continue to have faith for us." In other circumstances, as Mr McCann observed, yesterday's meeting would be among the highlights of any Catholic's life, but it was overshadowed by the fact that their daughter was still missing. ‘We’re in the middle of a race and we do not know how long it is going to be’ Mr McCann said the most difficult aspect of Madeleine's abduction was not knowing where she is. We're still in the middle of a race and we do not know how long it is going to be. "I do not know how we will have changed, but I think it is fair to say we will never be the same again." The couple, both 38, wore sombre dark suits for their encounter with Pope Bene-dict XVI, while Mrs McCann carried black rosary beads alongside two pictures of her daughter. One of them, showing Madeleine dressed in pink, is the main photograph used for an appeal poster which has been seen around the world. The strain of losing their daughter was clear to see. For much of the audience Mrs McCann, with the green and yellow ribbons in her hair fluttering in the breeze, kept her eyes closed. It was only during moments of music and song that she appeared at ease. Her husband, too, at times succumbed to tears. Seated behind the couple were the British ambassador to the Holy See, Francis Campbell, and their Foreign Office liaison officer, Clarence Mitchell. Nearby, a group of 15 deacons from the UK offered their support. Despite their struggle during the hour-and-a-half event, Mrs McCann seemed stronger and more composed as she spoke at length at a packed press conference about the pain of the four weeks Madeleine has been missing. "The first 72 hours really were the worst time for both of us. It was hard at that point to get away from the dark places," she said. "But as time goes on the support we have had and the prayers really do give us strength and hope. We are stronger and more positive." Describing her conversation with the Holy Father, she said: "I thanked him first of all for letting us meet him and I thanked him for his prayers. "It has been a very positive experience and it has helped us - it can only make us stronger and lifted us up more." The couple said their wider family had also benefited from yesterday's meeting, and they issued posters in Italian asking for information. They intend to go on and make the same appeals in Madrid, Berlin and Amsterdam. The family still have hope that Madeleine will be found safe and well. Mr McCann said: "We know that there could be a breakthrough at any time. We must believe and do believe that we can get Madeleine back with us." Mrs McCann said they still had no plans to go back to the UK and could not even begin to contemplate it. Last night the couple were on their way back on Sir Philip Green's jet in time to tuck their two-year-old twins, Sean and Amelie, into bed at the Praia da Luz resort from which Madeleine disappeared on May 3. During the flight the couple said they had been extremely warmly received by the British ambassador of the Holy See and his staff. Among them was Monseigneur Charlie Burns, like Gerry McCann a Glaswegian, who has been in Rome for 50 years and has close links to the embassy. Mr McCann said: "He gave us rosaries and told us this will remind you that I am praying for you every day'. "That prayer was very tactful, anyone could take anything they chose from it and it was very important for us." Mrs McCann added: "Charlie was lovely, he was so funny. Everyone at the embassy almost felt like family by the time we left." &copy; All rights reserved.

The Federal Court also reaffirmed that the civil court had no jurisdiction over any Islamic matters, even when non-Muslims are involved. Wednesday's verdict does not end the Muslim, non-Muslim divide, but may cause it to worsen as the tussle for primacy between inherited secular guarantees and a resurgent Islam demanding pre-eminence for Shariah laws continues, said observers. Non-Muslim leaders -- both political and religious -- reacted with shock and disbelief after the apex court ruled in a majority 2-1 decision that a Muslim cannot rely on Article 11 that guarantees freedom of worship to leave Islam but must go to a Shariah court to get a certificate to turn apostate. Ironically, Shariah law does not permit Muslims to become apostate but instead prescribes punishment with fines, forced rehabilitation or jail term. "Muslims going to Shariah court would incriminate themselves, invite prosecution," said Justice Richard Malajum, the dissenting judge, in the verdict who held that Article 11 applies to all citizens alike without discrimination. The ruling, which is binding on all lower civil courts, will affect at least a dozen cases of apostasy pending in civil courts, mainly involving Muslim converts who want to return to their former religions. It will also impact negatively on many cases where non-Muslims are fighting for justice such as custody of children, sharing of matrimonial wealth, maintenance and dissolution of civil marriage -- after one partner converts to Islam and relies on Shariah law to settle contentious issues. "The judgment does not end the Muslim, non-Muslim divide but has instead widened it by introducing Islamic principles into secular, constitutional matters," opposition leader Lim Kit Siang in an IPS interview. "A political solution is urgently needed to resolve this potentially dangerous disquiet," he told IPS. ‘'It is necessary for the government to take immediate steps to promote and protect the supremacy of the constitution," Lim said. Sisters in Islam, a prominent rights group for Muslim women, said it was disappointed the constitution had not been upheld. "For us, the dissenting judgment is significant," said Zainah Anwar, executive director. "The Federal Court, the apex court of the country, is divided over this issue, as the country is divided on it." ‘'There is a strong dissenting judgmentàthis issue is not over yet,'' said Malik Imtiaz Sarvar who handled several apostasy and other related cases in court. ‘'This decision reflects a growing trend of decisions in the courts where civil courts are abdicating their responsibility of providing legal redress to individuals who only seek to profess and live their religion according to their conscience,'' said Bishop Paul Tan of the Christian Federation of Malaysia. ‘'It is pressing for the government and lawmakers to revisit the relevant legislation and to reinstate the jurisdiction of the civil courts so that equal protection of the right to choose and express one's religion is accorded to all Malaysians, as enshrined in Article 11,'' he said in a statement. The ruling threatens to polarise an already polarised society with non-Muslims seeing the verdict as a confirmation that "creeping Islam" is eating into constitutional guarantees to religious freedom. Muslims however see the verdict as a victory and final confirmation that Shariah is superior to secular laws that are based on English common law foundation. Yusri Mohamad, the head of a coalition of about 80 Muslim NGOs called Pembela (Protector) that strongly campaigned for supremacy of Shariah, said justice had been served by the verdict. "The verdict is just and a relief to all Malaysians, Muslims and non-Muslims," Yusri told about 300 Muslims gathered outside the court. "It should not be perceived as a victory for Muslims and a loss to non-Muslims," he said. The verdict centred on a Malay woman, Azlina Jailani, 43, born a Muslim, who converted to Christianity in 1989 and changed her name to Lina Joy. She fell in love with an Indian Christian cook and wanted to marry in a civil ceremony and raise a family of her own. But Joy's national identity card referred to her as a Muslim although she had embraced Christianity. She fought the Islamic authorities and the national registration department for nine years to change her religious identity officially and move on. Joy's struggle became a test case for religious freedom in Malaysia with Muslims and non-Muslims rallying to her cause, especially her right to freedom of worship. "There was widespread hope that the Federal Court would stand firm and uphold the constitution especially Article 11, but that is not the case," said a prominent human rights activist who did not want to be identified fearing persecution. "It is a sad day for freedom and judicial independence," she said. Chief Justice Ahmad Fairuz Abdul Halim, who delivered the main judgment, held that Muslims cannot join or leave a religion according to their "whims and fancies.'' Muslims, he said, ‘'have to follow the requirements of their religion which is a complete religionàa way of life." Joy, who is believed to be in hiding, through her lawyer Benjamin Dawson expressed deep dissatisfaction at the verdict. "I am disappointed that the Federal Court is not able to vindicate a simple but important fundamental right that exists for all persons; namely, the right to believe in the religion of one's choice and equally important, the right to marry a person of one's choice and to raise a family," she said. "The Court has not only denied me that right but to all Malaysians who value fundamental freedoms," she said. "It is extremely difficult to exercise freedom of conscience here now." "Freedom of religion here is an illusion," said Leonard Teoh, a lawyer for the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism which also campaigned to protect Article 11. Lawyers feel that outside of a political solution, there is little else that activists can do after the court ruling. "A political solution has to come from the office of Prime Minister Abdullah Badawiàhe has to lead the way to protect the constitution and the rule of law," said Lim Guan Eng, secretary general of the Democratic Action party, the biggest opposition party in parliament. "When the courts have failed, parliament has to step in and make legislative changes to clarify issues and uphold secular rights which are the basis for a legal and modern society," Lim told IPS. But Badawi's ruling National Front government has a stranglehold on parliament controlling 90 percent of the 217 seats -- a massive majority that can steamroll any opposition. "Ultimately the solution is in the hands of the voters," Lim said. "Whether they speak up or remain silent."

In the latest twist to a murder case that has revived memories of the Cold War and strained British-Russian relations, the suspect, Andrei Lugovoi, sought to parry the accusations against him. "Britain is making me a scapegoat," Lugovoi, a former KGB bodyguard, said at a news conference in Moscow that was broadcast live on state television. He said that he did not know for certain who had killed Litvinenko with radioactive polonium in London last November, but that he could think of three possible suspects: British intelligence, the Mafia and Boris Berezovsky, a multimillionaire who fled Russia for Britain after repeated criticism of President Vladimir Putin and open admissions that he hoped to fund a political revolution in Russia. Lugovoi accused both Litvinenko and Berezovsky of working for British spy agencies and he charged that the murder was linked to such activity. Suspect in Litvinenko poisoning accuses Berezovsky and MI6 of murder Bicycle programs catching on in major cities Europe leads in designing buildings that save energy Asked whether he had firm proof of British intelligence involvement in the murder, Lugovoi replied "Yes." He offered no details. Lugovoi knew Litvinenko for several years and both worked in the 1990s in Moscow for Berezovsky. Britain said Thursday that its request for Lugovoi&#039;s extradition, which Moscow said it cannot honor, had nothing to do with British intelligence. "This is a criminal matter and is not an issue about intelligence," a Foreign Office spokesman said. "A British citizen was killed in London and U.K. citizens and visitors were put at risk." Berezovsky was not available for comment. Litvinenko, a former Russian Federal Security Service officer who obtained British citizenship, said in a statement made public after he died that Putin was behind his poisoning. The Kremlin has described that charge as nonsense and has accused its opponents living abroad of using the case to damage Russia&#039;s image.

SPME Condemns UCU Boycott Actions, Calls For Professors to Act- Establishes Anti Boycott Task Force Dr. Edward S. Beck By Dr. Edward S. Beck May 30, 2007 Exclusive to Scholars for Peace in the Middle East Faculty Forum SPME Statement on UCU Boycott The Board of Directors and over 10,000 Network Members of Scholars for Peace in the Middle East (SPME) are deeply disappointed to learn that the British University and College Union (UCU) have approved motions which could lead to a boycott of Israeli academics. SPME condemns this action, instigated by a small group of anti-Israel union delegates who appear not to represent the views of the union membership and who have singled out Israel for opprobrium. The motion is an attempt to delegitimize and to silence the only Jewish state in the world, one of a tiny minority of states in the Middle East that truly honor academic freedom. In Israel's prestigious universities, faculty members represent all religious and political persuasions. Many Israeli professors are Arabs; many are Muslims. How professors at universities in Arab countries are Jews? How many are non-Muslims? How many belong to nondominant Muslim denominations? In Iran, professors have been purged from universities for ideological and religious reasons, and an American academic, Haleh Esfandiari, was recently imprisoned while visiting her 93-year-old mother. Despite the gargantuan scale of human rights abuses in Sudan, Syria, China, Saudi Arabia, and, yes, Gaza, the UCU is not considering a boycott against any of them. Why not? The proposed boycott is immoral and antithetical to academic principles. It shuts off dialogue, when one of the key purposes of universities is to promote dialogue and thereby the pursuit of truth. It ignores existing projects where Israeli and Palestinian academics cooperate. It requires academics to hew to one ideological line. And it constitutes discrimination on the basis of nationality. Call to Action and Establishment of SPME International Task Force on Countering Academic and Professional Boycotts Here is what SPME is asking all professors to initiate a worldwide academic protest to this action: 1) Write to UCU head Sally Hunt at shunt@ucu.org,uk . Ms. Hunt has publicly opposed the boycott-enabling motions. Express your support for her argument that the boycott motion may not be implemented until it has been presented to, discussed by, and passed by a vote of the full membership, analogous to motions for strikes. Please share your thoughts, feelings and analysis in a collegial and respectful fashion. Please send blind copies of your letters to SPME at and the Fair Play Campaign Group at 2) Write to all professional or scholarly organizations with which you are affiliated. Urge or petition the leadership of that organization to issue a statement opposing academic boycotts in general and the UCU's boycott motion in particular. 3) As a result of these boycott action, Scholars for Peace in the Middle East is forming an International Task Force on Countering Academic and Professional Boycotts. Its charge will be to promote academic freedom and to wage anti-boycott campaigns in professional and academic organizations, societies and associations and in colleges and universities by working within these institutions as members of the academic community. SPME is recruiting interested contributing members to this important international task force. To join, you must be a contributing network member. To join, click here .

The full Task Force has not yet been appointed, but will include: Edward S. Beck, Ed.D., Walden University, President Scholars for Peace in the Middle East John R. Cohn, M.D. Professor of Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University Stanley Dubinsky, Ph.D., Associate Dean, University of South Carolina, SPME Board of Directors Lizbeth Fried, Ph.D., University of Michigan Richard Lubman, M.D.University of Southern California School of Medicine, SPME-USC Chapter Co-Chair Ed Morgan, JD Ph.D. University of Toronto School of Law Edgar Pick, M.D. Ph.D., Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University Elihu Richter, M.D. Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center Harvey Risch, M.D, Yale University School of Medicine Comments from Academic Peers on the Boycott Edward Beck, Walden University and President of SPME, commented: " In calling for a boycott of Israel academics, the British have separated themselves, not the Israelis, from the global academic community which firmly condemns academic boycotts for moral, ethical and intellectual reasons, frequently acknowledging that academics are active in trying to solve problems and not create additional ones." "I am sorry that one of the first acts of the newly formed University and College Union has been to jettison the principle of the Universality of Science and Learning, which has been at the heart of academic activity for so long This decision brings discredit on the Union." said Oxford University scientist, Michael Yudkin. Ashley Grossman, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London points out, "...I have yet to meet any member of an Israeli University who believes that there should be other than an establishment of a Palestinian state on equal terms with Israel: would that were true of all Palestinian opinion. The organisers of the boycott may state otherwise, but this one is another example of creeping salon anti-semitism that we are now become accustomed to in the UK." Hebrew University Vidal Sasson Center for Research on Anti-Semitism Research Associate and SPME Board Member from Germany, Matthias Kuentzel remarks. "Hostilities against Israel appear today in the form of a pincer movement: On one side, we have anti-Semites such as Ahmadinejad or Hamas who draw their “knowledge” about Jews from the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion.” On the other side we have non-Jewish and Jewish “fellow travellers of anti-Semitism” in progressive Western movements and governments who take up and proliferate, albeit in muted form, Iran’s attempts to delegitimize Israel." Associate Dean Stanley Dubinsky of the University of South Carolina, also a member of the SPME Board of Directors urges his colleagues to consider these thoughts. "The passage of an academic boycott motion by the University and College Union (UCU) confirms for the rest of the academic world, more than anything else, what American Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg calls a "widespread anti-Israel and anti-semitic current in British opinion". The British anti-semites of Brighton (UB) and East London (UEL) have come skittering out from under the woodwork to make their loathing of Israel a matter of public record. In their ardor for their cause, they appear to have ignored the fact that their motion places their faculty union and all of its members squarely at odds with the most basic principles of academic freedom. By the promotion of academic boycotts and political censure, UCU will become actively engaged (in its inaugural year) in the undermining of open and free excha! nge of ideas and will place itself firmly in opposition to the advancement of human knowledge. In response to this and other previous boycott attempts, I have secured honorary affiliations with Bar Ilan University and Haifa University. In this manner, I declare myself to be a member of that class to which the UCU boycott pertains (for the purposes of making it clear that I fit into the boycotted category, the UCU membership should attribute to me any and all opinions which would place me in the class of individuals to be boycotted). I, for my part, will not boycott anyone for their beliefs in my various editorial and academic roles, but I will be certain to advise all my British correspondents and colleagues of the dilemma that a UCU boycott may place them in, whenever appropriate. I would urge all academics of moral courage and ethical decency to do likewise, and secure for themselves the yellow star of Israeli affiliation, and so help the British unionists to more quickly! realize what fools they have made of themselves and their col! leagues. " Donna Robinson Divine, Morningstar Professor of Government, Smith College observes, " The UCU call for a boycott reveals not only profound ignorance of the Middle East conflict but also deep illiteracy about the academic mission. Academicians should be able to think without resort to slogans and mantras." Law Professor Ed Morgan of the University of Toronto, makes this interesting analysis, "In the United States, the Export Administration Act, as amended in 1977, represents a comprehensive legislative response to the longstanding Arab League trade and investment boycott of Israel. Prohibited activities include refusing to do business for boycott reasons, taking discriminatory actions that are boycott based, engaging in schemes intended to place a boycotted person or entity at a commercial disadvantage, etc. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department enforces the anti-boycott provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, which deny certain tax benefits to those who agree to “participate in or cooperate with an international boycott.” While the focus of the legislation is on commercial relationships, and it might take some inventive interpretations or even amendments to apply the law to non-commercial contexts such as university activities, the notion that nationality-base! d boycotts are offensive in a liberal society is certainly reflected in the anti-boycott statutes. The important link between a boycott of Israel - be it commercial or academic - and the impact on the Jewish community was succinctly stated by President Jimmy Carter who, in signing the EAA amendments into force on June 22, 1977, declared that, “The bill seeks…to end the divisive effects on American life of foreign boycotts aimed at Jewish members of our society.” It may seem ironic today, but it was President Carter who identified those who would boycott Israel as practicing a special form of apartheid. Carter stated, “If we allow such a precedent to become established, we open the door to similar action against any ethnic, religious, or racial group in America.” University of Buffalo SPME Chapter Chair Prof. Ernest Sternberg, comments, " Today, leaders of the British academic labor union have approved a boycott of Jewish academics, in Israel, the country in which Jews have built as a democratic, tolerant home in the wake of worldwide discrimination, pogroms, and genocide. At a time when Israel is subjected to threats and active attempts at annihilation from Iran, Hizbullah, Hamas, and Islamist extremists, the UCU has sought once again to target the victim. While hundreds of thousands are murdered in Darfur, repressive occupation continues in Tibet, ethnic cleansing takes place West Irian, and suicide-terrorism causes mass murder in around the world, UCU targets Israel. Through ignorance or malice, UCU leaders have, though this scapegoating of Israel, become complicit with bigotry, racism, and the yearning for genocide.” SPME Board of Directors Edward S.

On this date 429 years ago, Martin Frobisher sailed from Harwich, England to Canada, where he mistakenly mined fool's gold, (on two separate occasions) that was eventually used to pave streets in London. And a very happy birthday to both Kellogg's Corn Flakes which was patented 123 years ago today, and to "Seinfeld" which debuted 17 years ago today. Here's Your Thursday Top Six: 6) One Legged Man Kicks Butt If cheating death were an Olympic event, Roger Baxter would deserve a gold medal. The Vietnam Vet (who lost his right leg last year in a freak tractor-trailer accident) used his crutches to take down a pair of armed robbers -- even after one shot him in the torso. Thankfully his cell phone caught the worst of the bullet, affording Baxter enough time to wind up and crack his assailant. "I went head to head against a semi back in October and today I went up against a 9mm ," Baxter was quoted as saying. Unfortunately the cell-phone, which had just been programmed, didn't make it. 5) Pulling His Leg And while we're on the subject of amputees, a former Schuylkill County Prison inmate has filed a lawsuit alleging that guards took away his prosthetic leg and "tossed it around until they broke it." Thomas Zimmerman, of Mahanoy Plane, Pa., claims after his limb was confiscated he fell, "twice in the shower and again on his way back to his room." Despite fracturing his stump, medical personnel allegedly didn't take him seriously, withholding "pain medication, and treat[ing] the breaks Animal rights takes dogged determination. (AP) 4) Dog Eat Dog Protester There are times when a protester's demonstration seems worse than that which is actually being protested. . . this is one of those times. On Tuesday night, British performance artist Mark McGowan ate parts of Queen Elizabeth's favorite breed of dog in order to protest "alleged mistreatment of animals by the royal family." McGowan dined al fresco on a London street, consuming what he claims were corgi meatballs mixed with apple, onion and seasoning. The meal was intended to draw attention to allegations that the Queen's husband, Prince Phillip, beat "a fox to death during a hunt ." It remains unclear whether we would have been spared Mr. McGowan's canine consumption had the Prince shot the fox to death instead. 3) Fatal Attraction Redux And while we're on the subject of consuming pets (it's either that or amputees, I'm afraid), Ananova is reporting that a German bricklayer got back at his girlfriend by killing the couple's guinea pig and serving it to her during at a "romantic dinner." Werner Brenner, of Darmstadt, had long accused Lara Hochner of loving their pet Rudi more than him, so when she was out of the house, he "killed Rudi with a hammer, disemboweled him, fried him and served him ." It was only after they had finished eating that the 29-year-old guinea pig butcher admitted what he had done. As you might imagine, they have since broken up. From our "Only in America" file, an Iowa woman is suing Wal-Mart after she slipped and fell in a puddle of vomit. June Medema, of Davenport, claims she "suffered serious neck and upper back injuries," as a result of Wal-Mart's negligence, though her lawsuit "does not specifically say how the store was negligent ." No word yet on whether the puker has been identified or if he or she intends to also sue Wal-Mart for their negligent, stomach turning interior decorating, which some juries might agree caused the vomiting. 1) When Advertising Attacks! In our topsy-turvy, post-9/11 world it's sometimes difficult to tell terrorism from terrible advertising. Why just this week in Massachusetts, a Bank of America employee mistook a half printed promotional fax for a bomb threat. As a result the building and a dozen neighboring businesses, including one daycare center, were evacuated and a state police bomb squad was called. Eventually they discovered that the fax, sent by a Bank of America marketing group, was "an internal communication designed only for our employees ," some of whom apparently fear detonation at the hands of their advertising department.

As journalists looked on, a judge who mediated in the matter escorted the four men to the governor's office in southern Rivers State and turned them over to authorities. U.S. Embassy officials weren't immediately available for comment. The men's identities were not released. Chevron Corp. reported May 9 only that the men had been seized when their work boat was stopped by gunmen armed with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. Some 200 foreigners have been kidnapped since armed militants stepped up attacks on the oil industry and the government in late 2005, pressing their demand that more oil revenue be put into the impoverished Niger Delta. Most hostages have been quickly released for ransom. Growing lawlessness, including the armed attacks, in the oil-rich region have caused a 25 percent decrease in petroleum exports from Nigeria, Africa's leading oil producer. In his inaugural speech Tuesday, President Umaru Yar'Adua appealed for an immediate end to violence in the region of swamps, creeks and mangrove forests. The largest militant group said it would consider the overture. Elsewhere in the region, Royal Dutch Shell PLC said it had suspended oil shipments of 150,000 barrels a day because protesters had besieged one of its export terminals this week. The protesters tampered with some pipeline equipment, forcing the shutdown of the Bomu Manifold center Monday in the Ogoni district of Nigeria's southern oil region, company spokesman Precious Okolobo said. "We had to defer export of 150,000 barrels per day," Okolobo said. It was the second disruption of supply on the pipeline, which sends oil from onshore facilities around the city of Port Harcourt to Shell's Bonny oil export terminal.

Roh, whose term expires in February, also said there could be time while he's in office to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il &mdash; but only if the reclusive North moves to abandon its nuclear program. "We have offered to help in resolving the (bank) issue to both sides, but after our offer there has not been an answer from either side," Roh said during an interview with AP President and CEO Tom Curley. He did not elaborate, but local news reports have said Seoul was considering asking a South Korean bank to be the middleman for getting the money to a North Korean account. "I really find it very difficult to understand" the technical issues holding up the money transfer, Roh said. International talks on North Korea's nuclear program have been beset by repeated delays since the crisis erupted in late 2002, and most recently are deadlocked over some $25 million in North Korean accounts frozen in a Macau bank. That bank was blacklisted in 2005 by Washington for alleged complicity in counterfeiting U.S. dollars and money laundering by the Pyongyang regime. Washington agreed to help free the money to win North Korea's promise to shut down its sole operating nuclear reactor by mid-April and eventually dismantle its weapons program. But the money has not yet been withdrawn because other banks have shunned the tainted funds &mdash; and North Korea has refused to lock down its reactor until it gets the money. The top U.S. negotiator on North Korea, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill, appealed Thursday for Pyongyang to shut down its reactor regardless of the financial dispute. But after meetings with Chinese nuclear envoy Wu Dawei in Beijing, he said there was no new resolution to that matter. To help relax regional tension, Roh also left open the possibility of holding a summit with the North's Kim, which would follow the first-and-only such meeting between the two Koreas in 2000 between Kim and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. However, he said such talks could not go forward without movement at the six-nation North Korea nuclear talks, which also include China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States. Talk of a North-South summit has percolated recently in Seoul, drawing fire from opponents as an inappropriate political ploy to help boost Roh's liberals ahead of December presidential elections. "Regardless of my term, I believe a good time would be when the six-party talks are well on (their) way to implementation and when we can be sure that a summit will contribute to cementing this progress," Roh said. Ties cooled between the two Koreas last year after North Korea tested a barrage of missiles in July and tensions deepened after Pyongyang conducted its first-ever nuclear test in October. The Koreas resumed efforts at rapprochement after the North pledged initial steps to nuclear disarmament. Those efforts also have been put on hold over the North's delay in shutting down its nuclear reactor. A high-level delegation from North Korea was in Seoul for reconciliation talks set to end Friday, where the South has insisted the North start to dismantle its weapons program before Seoul delivers promised aid. Roh said Seoul would continue to press the North to disarm, using aid as leverage. South Korea has drawn criticism at home and abroad over its "sunshine policy" of continued engagement even as Pyongyang refuses to back down from nuclear weapons development. "The fact that the Korean government is practicing the 'sunshine policy' toward North Korea does not mean that we forfeit all rights to take issue with North Korea's missile launches and nuclear test," Roh said. "Although we fully embrace the 'sunshine policy,' I believe that what has to be said, has to be said." Associated Press writers Jae-soon Chang and Beth Duff-Brown contributed to this report.

News on your cellphone Get your free blog Free news for your site Blair a 'good friend' of Africa, says Mandela Carol Hills | Johannesburg, South Africa 31 May 2007 04:35 Former president Nelson Mandela has told outgoing British Prime Minister Tony Blair he looks forward to welcoming "a young man like you" to the club of retired presidents when Blair leaves office on June 27. However, Mandela warned Blair that some of its members -- himself chief among them -- "only became active after stepping down from public office". Mandela and his wife, Graca Machel, met Blair and his wife, Cherie Booth, at the Nelson Mandela Foundation in Houghton, Johannesburg, on Thursday afternoon during Blair's last official visit to the country. Media arrived more than an hour early to be assured of front-row places but were reduced to scrumming for position after a sniffer dog was brought in to inspect their equipment. It was another free-for-all when the busload of press travelling with Blair arrived from the University of South Africa's business school, in Midrand, where he had given an address, In the end, not even control barriers could hold the media back as they spilled on to the ground at Mandela's feet when he greeted Blair: "Ah, Tony, how are you? Why are you getting younger every day?". "You look nice," Mandela told Booth -- who has come in for much criticism over her wardrobe. She was wearing a blue-grey, knee-length coat edged in white, with white shoes decoratively buckled. "Would you recognise me if you saw me again," he asked British High Commissioner to South Africa Paul Boateng. "I've got a strong weapon here," Mandela told an aide, raising his heavy walking stick, at her concerns about the encroaching journalists and photographers. "When are you retiring?" he asked a familiar face, turning to greet another from the South African Broadcasting Corporation as he shuffled forward, wearing one of his trademark shirts, in gold with a red Aids ribbon at his throat. "We are delighted Prime Minister Blair has decided to honour us with a visit on his last trip to Africa," Mandela read from a prepared statement. "He has been a very good friend of Africa," he said. Blair has already visited Libya as part of his farewell tour and arrived in South Africa from Sierra Leone, the second stop on his itinerary, on Thursday morning. He is scheduled to hold talks with President Thabo Mbeki on Friday before heading back to Britain. Wishing Blair the "very best for his future", Mandela expressed confidence that his commitment to, among others, poverty eradication, would continue after he was out of office. "I know that your energy, passion and youth can still play a big role in international affairs and we look forward to the contribution you will continue to make," Mandela said. Before his short, private talks with Mandela, Blair described it as "an honour and privilege" to stand next to Mandela. He thanked the elderly statesman "for everything he has done in his life, but also for showing that it is possible for things to change". That South Africa is as strong as it is today is in no small measure due to the leadership of Mandela, Blair said.

(registration is optional) Story published at magicvalley.com on Thursday, May 31, 2007 Last modified on Thursday, May 31, 2007 6:45 AM MDT In this photo released by the Palestinian Authority, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, right, and Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, left, meet in Gaza City, Wednesday, May 30, 2007. (AP Photo/Abd Alhalim Abu Askar, Palestinian Authority,HO) Abbas, Olmert to Try to Mend Cease-Fire GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip - The Israeli and Palestinian leaders will meet next week in the Palestinian territories for the first time in a bid to restore a shattered cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, a senior Palestinian official said Thursday. The announcement came amid a slowdown in violence after two weeks of fighting between Palestinian rocket squads and Israeli forces. The fighting is expected to dominate the agenda of next week's meeting between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. "The president is working night and day for a mutual, comprehensive cease-fire," said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a top aide to Abbas. Abu Rdeneh said next week's summit, scheduled for Thursday, "is expected in the Palestinian territories." Officials would not say where, but in the past they have mentioned the West Bank oasis of Jericho as the likely venue. While the two leaders have held a series of meetings over the past year, the Palestinians haven't hosted any of the gatherings. Olmert's spokeswoman, Miri Eisin, said a West Bank meeting is "a possibility," but said the date and location still have not been finalized. Olmert and Abbas promised Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice back in March to meet every two weeks with the aim of moving beyond day-to-day issues and begin discussing the outlines of a final peace agreement. However, the men have met just once since then, in April, and next week's talks will focus on the fighting. A five-month truce in Gaza unraveled earlier this month when the Hamas militant group began firing barrages of rockets into southern Israel, prompting Israel to respond with a series of airstrikes. More than 50 Palestinians, most of them militants, and two Israeli civilians have been killed. In the latest violence, Israeli aircraft attacked a Palestinian rocket-launching squad in northern Gaza Thursday. No injuries were reported. "We will actively pursue and hit these rocket launchers as well as those who operate them," said David Baker, an official in Olmert's office. Despite the flareup, there were signs of a slowdown in fighting. Hamas' military wing, which has been responsible for most of the recent rocket fire, said it has not launched a projectile in 48 hours. "Perhaps there is an unannounced cease-fire," Abu Rdeneh said. The smaller Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for Thursday's rocket fire. In a separate incident, Islamic Jihad said two members were slightly injured in an Israeli artillery strike. But the army denied involvement. Still, the number of rocket attacks has sharply dropped in recent days. Israel resolved on Wednesday to keep striking Gaza rocket squads and said it wasn't negotiating a truce with radical groups. Israeli officials believe the Israeli air campaign is the reason for the reduced rocket fire. Abbas, a moderate who favors peacemaking, has been pushing Hamas to restore the Gaza cease-fire. But he has been ineffective in halting militant attacks. Abbas' Fatah movement and Hamas are partners in the Palestinian coalition government. That partnership is extremely fragile, however, and Hamas began attacking Israel in an apparent attempt to halt a fresh wave of Palestinian infighting. Abbas has proposed a truce agreement that would commit Gaza militants to halt their rocket fire for a month to permit negotiations on a more comprehensive cease-fire including the West Bank. Militants have said a truce is out of the question as long as Israel keeps up its attacks and refuses to bring a truce to the West Bank, where it frequently conducts arrest raids. Israel has so far rejected the notion of applying the truce to West Bank, especially in light of the latest round of attacks from Gaza. Meanwhile, Hamas and Fatah are expected to meet next week to discuss shoring up an internal truce called after this month's infighting, which killed more than 50 Palestinians, said a senior Egyptian security official. Both sides have sent representatives to Cairo to individually speak to Egyptian mediators about the reasons for the latest outbreak in fighting, and the possibilities of coming to a truce with Israel. The two sides are expected to agree to form a committee that will include an impartial Egyptian observer to call judgment on violations of the truce currently holding between Palestinians, said Lt. Col. Burhan Hamad, head of the Gaza-based Egyptian security delegation. "But it's not a guarantee against fighting," Burhan warned. Although the internal truce has mostly held, mistrust runs deep. Both sides have welcomed Egyptian involvement. "We want to get out of mutual accusations through the refereeing of a third party, trusted by both sides, and that is the Egyptians," said Mohammed Dahlan, a Fatah strongman in Gaza, speaking on an Arab news television station on Thursday.

So many leading groups and individuals around the whole world have come together." Google Takes Big Step To Make Web Work Offline SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc. (GOOG) said on Wednesday it had created Web software that runs both online, and offline, marking a sea change for the Internet industry by letting users work on planes, trains, spotty connections and even in the most remote locations. The technology, called Google Gears, would allow users of computers, phones and other devices to manipulate Web services like e-mail, online calendars or news readers whether online, intermittently connected to the Web or completely offline. By bridging the gulf between new Web services and the older world of desktop software, where any data changes are stored locally on users&#8217; machines, Google is pushing the Web into whole new spheres of activity and posing a challenge to rival Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), leader in the desktop software era. &#8220;The Web is great but it doesn&#8217;t work very well when you don&#8217;t have a Web connection,&#8221; Jeff Huber, Google&#8217;s vice president of engineering, said in an interview. &#8220;Gears addresses a functional gap on the Web.&#8221; Google plans to make the Gears technology available for free as &#8220;open source&#8221; software, meaning other developers are free to use and enhance the software in their own products. Gears promises to expand the usage of scores of Google products and services, as well as thousands of programs from independent software makers, by making them more accessible at previously inconvenient times and places. The technology also allows developers to build Internet search and indexing of Web pages into their own software applications, Huber said. Many such products will be able to make limited searches offline, since they will have downloaded data automatically when connected. Google&#8217;s full Web search functions would return once the user reconnects to the Internet. Early partners who will use Gears in their products include design software leader Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE.O: Quote, Profile, Research, maker of Flash animation and Acrobat document-sharing software, as well as new Apollo tools that work online and offline, Adobe said. Other organizations working with Google are Norway&#8217;s Opera Software ASA (OPERA), maker of a Web browser popular with mobile phone users, and Mozilla, the group behind Firefox, the biggest alternative to Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer browser, according to Google. Analysts said Google&#8217;s move capitalizes on a growing trend over the past couple of years for Web applications to behave as responsively as desktop software. Microsoft already offers technologies like Groove, which allows users to work offline, then synchronize changes when connected later. But the software giant has been reluctant to make existing products work both online and offline. Technologies such as AJaX, shorthand for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, Adobe&#8217;s Flash or Microsoft&#8217;s new Silverlight technology have made this increasingly possible. &#8220;Now the Web is becoming so good that there is less and less of a reason to build software that just runs on desktop computers,&#8221; said Gartner analyst David Smith of Bedford, New Hampshire. &#8220;In the past, developers had to make some pretty clear trade-offs between the Web and software for desktops.&#8221; Google Gears promises to help further close the gap for software developers across the industry. &#8220;This is a very big step, but I would say it is an obvious step,&#8221; Huber said. The first Google product to feature Gears will be Google Reader, which allows consumers automatically to track updates to hundreds of Web sites. Users could connect temporarily for updates, then go offline and read up on recent Web news. We expect this to be extended to other Google applications over time,&#8221; Huber said, without setting any timeframes. Once retrofitted, for example, Google Apps, the company&#8217;s free, advertising-supported group of Web programs including word processing and spreadsheets that can be shared and edited by groups, could work with only periodic Web connections. Huber said Gears&#8217; biggest impact could be in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, where poor or non-existent Internet connections hobble access to digital information. Google made the announcement ahead of its Google Developer Day conference, which is taking place on Thursday in 10 cities around the world starting in Sydney and culminating at the San Jose Convention Center in Silicon Valley later in the day. &#8211; By Eric Auchard Share and save this post: These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages. Gill Questions Channel 2 &#8216;Button Men&#8217; Blog Reference A verbal scuffle between two media personalities on the WKRN Channel 2 payroll erupted into controversy on the radio airwaves and the local blogosphere Wednesday â€” the same day the stationâ€™s new newsroom management reported for work. WKRN blogger Adam Kleinheider posted a blog entry on his Volunteer Voters web site referring to U.S. soldiers as â€œbutton menâ€ and â€œpawns.â€ Kleinheiderâ€™s post was also linked to and seconded by fellow WKRN blogger Brittney Gilbert on her Nashville Is Talking blog. That post prompted conservative talk radio show host Steve Gill, a contributing WKRN news analyst, to lambaste Kleinheider and Gilbert live on statewide airwaves Wednesday morning, telling listeners to call the station if they were offended. Wednesday was also the first day of work for the stationâ€™s new news director, Matthew Zelkind, who is part of a leadership transition at the station following the departure of former General Manager Mike Sechrist. Sechrist is credited with creating WKRNâ€™s new media program, which includes the Kleinheider and Gilbert blogs. The station is widely regarded as the only news outlet in town that pays for full-time bloggers and support staff. â€œWKRN has been written and talked about within the trade and professional organizations for what theyâ€™re doing, but very seldom is the content or audience reaction part of that discussion,â€ said Thom Storey, chairman of the Media Studies Department at Belmont University. â€œIt has been kind of a bold venture, but they have remained in last place in local ratings throughout.â€ Although the WKRN blogs contain disclaimers stating that opinions on the blogs arenâ€™t necessarily those of the station, they are produced by WKRN and are included on the station web siteâ€™s blog menu. Gilbert and Kleinheider have editorial control of what they write, according to sources close to the station and they work out of the WKRN newsroom. Neither Zelkind nor Gwen Kinsey, WKRNâ€™s new general manager, could be reached despite repeated phone calls. Gilbert and Kleinheider were reached by The City Paper in WKRNâ€™s offices but declined to comment for this story. Wednesdayâ€™s public scuffle began Tuesday, when Kleinheider offered commentary on his blog to a video critical of anticipated conservative presidential candidate Fred Thompson speaking about the service of U.S. soldiers. â€œMany, many soldiers, save those at the very top of the pyramid, are pawns. They are button men for our civilian leadership,â€ Kleinheider stated in his blog post. â€œSpouting the platitudes can be useful enough to build morale and boost recruiting but at some level we must [be] honest with ourselves [and] recognize what the military is and what it isnâ€™t â€” myths and fairy tales aside.â€ Steve Gill responded on his radio show, The Steve Gill Show, Wednesday morning, taking exception to Kleinheiderâ€™s post as well as Gilbertâ€™s additional commentary supporting it. Gill singled out Kleinheiderâ€™s characterization of troops as â€œbutton menâ€ â€” a term Gill said is a reference to mafia gun men. The Steve Gill Show is a statewide talk radio program that airs locally on NewsRadio 1510 WLAC. â€œButton men are the hit men for the mafia, the muscle, the hired thugs,â€ Gill wrote on his own web site. â€œHe compares our soldiers to killers for hire. You might want to let Channel 2 know what you think about that.â€ Gill said Wednesday that he doesnâ€™t â€œseek out opportunities to criticizeâ€ WKRN, but his affiliation with the station does not limit â€” by official policy or otherwise â€” what he says in his morning show. Gill also writes a semi-regular column for The City Paper. â€œIf Channel 4 or Channel 5 had done this, Iâ€™d be calling them on it,â€ he said in a Wednesday interview. â€œIâ€™m not going to sacrifice my credibility to cover for anybody, whether itâ€™s Channel 2 or the Republican Party or the University of Tennessee (Gillâ€™s alma mater).â€ Gill said he had discussed his comments made on the radio show with WKRN management Wednesday. â€œWe had a full and fair discussion,â€ Gill said. â€œThey understand I donâ€™t like what they wrote. I understand they have to write what they want.â€ Storey said the new media offerings at WKRN as well as the latest controversy highlight ethical issues, like whether a conservative talk show host should be working as a news analyst and whether itâ€™s desirable for bloggers to be associated with a television network affiliate. â€œThe label â€˜journalistâ€™ is becoming so cloudy,â€ Storey said. â€œIn print, itâ€™s much easierâ€¦ things are labeled â€˜opinion.â€™â€ &#8211; By Amy Griffith Share and save this post: These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages. Dead in Afghanistan: May 2007 Sarah Meyer, Index Research Robert Fisk Photo Gallery 1. The Dead in Afghanistan U.S. numbers of military deaths in Iraq receive a lot of attention. Unfortunately, other deaths in Iraq do not receive their due respect. But American public awareness of murder/death in Afghanistan is cloudy. Nor do people realise that foreign troops are as unwelcome in Afghanistan as they are in Iraq. This article is about some of those deaths in Afghanistan. Civilian deaths have recently infuriated the Afghan people. The Americans â€˜pay offâ€™ these deaths -as if money is compatible with and resolves grief. I have not included all deaths because of the &#8216;labels&#8217; put on to them either by the military or the media. Their mindset insist on using words like â€˜Al Qaeda,â€™ â€˜Taliban,â€™ â€˜militantsâ€™, â€˜insurgents.â€™ It would be more correct to use the Afghan language - the â€œTalibanâ€™ refer to themselves as . As in Iraq, there are many people who legally object to - are resistant to - the occupation of their country. It is unfortunate that the U.S. military does not appear to respect the death of any Afghan, whatever their label. There are further coalition deaths which are not included. The numbers given in official tallies vary. And I have surely missed some â€˜civilianâ€™ deaths. Apologies. Some very callous remarks have been made by the U.S. Military in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Here is a â€˜commentâ€™ made to the article (18.05): â€œAs for the muslims- kill &#8216;em all and let satan sort &#8216;em out. I don&#8217;t think G_D wants anything to with them- he sent them to the pit after all.â€ And who supports this war criminal attitude?

It turns out that the Iraqis arenâ€™t like German or Japanese people at all, but rather a fiercely independent (if overly complex) nation deeply resentful of a so-called liberation which has brought them nothing but pain and agony, primarily at the hands of those who have, unbidden, â€œfreedâ€ them from their past.

About Online Surveys, Traditional Pollsters Are: (C) Somewhat Disappointed To traditional pollsters, a random survey adjusted to reflect the general population is the only way to measure public opinion properly. First developed in the 1940s by George Gallup, the father of modern polling, random sampling requires hours of costly legwork by an army of specially trained pollsters. But some survey companies that offer an Internet-based alternative to traditional polls are trying to make inroads, including a British one, YouGov, which plans to introduce its methods in the United States for the next presidential election. Working with a large panel of respondents who answer a range of questions through an online questionnaire, YouGov says it can predict election outcomes and consumer preferences with greater accuracy for far less money than ever before. To reflect a broad spectrum of opinion, the online panelists are recruited from all walks of life, and efforts are made to reach out to people who are less likely to be online, like the elderly and people with low incomes. Panelists are paid to participate â€” which is a big no-no in conventional polling â€” and their identities are validated by their home addresses and other personal details. To be sure, traditional pollsters and political consultants do not view online surveys as scientifically acceptable. The sampling of consumer opinion tapped through an online questionnaire cannot be as random as traditional measures, they argue, and it is easier for people to misrepresent themselves and their opinions online. Another critical difference is that in traditional polls, participation is voluntary, not paid. â€œVoter polling by the Internet is not yet viable,â€ said Joel Benenson, a Democratic pollster working for the presidential campaign of Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. â€œThere are some uses for online polling, but it still misses out on too much of the population for us.â€ Despite the strong skepticism, Internet-based survey results are likely to get some publicity during the 2008 elections, and executives from companies that conduct these surveys hope that they can use the attention to gain credibility for their methods. YouGov, for example, has formed a partnership with Polimetrix, an online survey company based in Palo Alto, Calif., for surveys in the United States. Polimetrix, with a panel of one million people, plans to track the 2008 presidential election with a 50-state survey covering a minimum of 1,000 panelists in each state. â€œState-by-state election results are an important way for us to prove that our methodology delivers accurate results,â€ said Douglas Rivers, a Stanford University political science professor who founded Polimetrix in 2004. â€œYou can be lucky once, but not 50 times.â€ Professor Rivers said that the margin of error for Polimetrix surveys is similar to that of polls conducted by telephone. YouGov said that its own results in recent British elections were as close or closer to the actual votes than traditional polling methods. Mr. Benenson of the Obama campaign said that the Internet can be an effective way to test ad campaigns for specific populations, but that the variables are too great for judging the views of the general population. Polls on which public policy decisions are based still require walking the streets, said Leendert de Voogd, managing director of TNS Opinion in Brussels, one of the worldâ€™s largest polling companies. â€œIt is still way too early for public opinion polling to go online,â€ Mr. de Voogd said. â€œInternet polling is like the Far West, with no rules, no sheriff and no reference points.â€ Among the surveys run by TNS Opinion is Eurobarometer, a survey of public opinion across Europe conducted for the European Commission since 1973. â€œThe decisions made on the basis of our polls are far too important to be left to an online survey,â€ Mr. de Voogd said. â€œOnline polls can miss very important parts of the population.â€ For YouGov, developing a balanced panel of regular respondents from all sectors of the population is a priority, said Nadhim Zahawi, YouGovâ€™s chief executive. â€œWe expend a lot of effort reaching older people and other demographicsâ€ of people who are less likely to use the Internet, he said. Mr. Zahawi added that modern technology has made old-fashioned polls more cumbersome and unreliable. â€œThanks to the increased use of mobile phones, the traditional pollsters face a growing problem of how to track down people at home,â€ he said. In London, The Daily Telegraph, which uses YouGovâ€™s services roughly twice a month, appreciates the ability to query a large number of people in a short time. â€œThey allow us to ask twice the number compared with most polls,â€ said Anthony King, a professor of government at the University of Essex who commissions surveys for The Daily Telegraph. â€œThe bottom line is that they get results faster and as good or better than other polling agencies.â€ But to Mr. de Voogd of TNS Opinion and other polling company executives, nothing less than classic polling methodology will deliver results. This technique calls for a country like Britain to be divided into 150 cells, or sampling points, with a starting address chosen at random for the pollsters to begin their walk. â€œYou cannot replace wearing down shoe leather to do good polls,â€ Mr. de Voogd said. â€œIt does take money and time walking house to house, but quality has a price.â€ From the starting address, the interviewer follows a random route that could resemble this: Walk left away from the first address, turning left on the first street, then count three blocks and turn right. On that block, count five houses and knock on the door of the sixth house. Ask to speak with the person whose birthday is closest to the date of the interview. If the person is not there, the interviewer must attempt to contact that same person up to eight times or until the person declines to participate. A separate person does a follow-up interview with 20 percent of those polled to verify that the interviews were conducted strictly according to the methodology. The technique is different at YouGov, where a panel of 175,000 Britons is developed, nourished and surveyed. Each member of the panel, who is confirmed to fit a certain demographic category, receives points for answering questions posed â€” and answered â€” on the Internet. When enough points are accrued, the panelist receives Â£50, or about $99. Individual respondents may be contacted up to once every two weeks. YouGov has also set up a partnership with a brokerage firm, Execution Limited, to analyze the impact of consumer trends on the imminent financial results of companies. This would, for example, allow a company to determine whether consumers prefer clothes this season from Gap or Marks &#038; Spencer, a British retailer, Mr. Zahawi said. For all these advantages, online polling cannot work in places with low Internet penetration, Mr. de Voogd said. â€œPerhaps you could do an online poll in the Netherlands, where almost everyone has Internet, but thatâ€™s about it,â€ Mr. de Voogd said. â€œOnly eight European countries even have half the population online.â€ The problem, according to both Mr. de Voogd and Mr. Benenson of the Obama campaign, is that Internet users do not necessarily reflect a nationâ€™s population. â€œRural voters, older voters and lower-income voters tend to be underrepresented on the Internet,â€ Mr. Benenson said. â€œBy the mere fact that someone in these categories is on the Internet thus makes them unrepresentative for extrapolating views of their demographic.â€ But Professor King of the University of Essex does not agree with this argument. â€œThere is no evidence to suggest that people who use the Internet are fundamentally different from those without it,â€ he said. â€œOne mad, awful lady living in a poor neighborhood without Internet does not differ much from her mad, awful friend next door who goes online.â€ &#8211; By Thomas Crampton Share and save this post: These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages. The new Iraqi media law: who controls the controllers? In April 2007 Dr Siyamend Othman, CEO of the Communications and Media Commission of Iraq (CMC) (1), presented his draft of for a comprehensive regulation of the country&#8217;s media and telecommunication, the â€œIraqi Media and Telecommunications Lawâ€, to the Iraqi parliament for evaluation so that it can then be presented for a first reading. The draft outlines the competencies and rules for the distribution of licenses, the composition of the regulatory body, and punishments for violations of the regulations. The CMC itself will be renamed â€œFederal Media and Telecommunications Commissionâ€ and have â€œsole responsibility for the licensing and regulation of cable and wireless telecommunications services, broadcasting and transmission services, information services (the Internet) and other media servicesâ€ in all of Iraq (Art. 52). The commission will fall under the supervision of Parliament. The law gives the CMC control over both broadcast media and telecommunications. Print media are initially subsumed under â€œmediaâ€ but then throughout the law only broadcast media and telecommunications are addressed. A â€œMedia Advisory Committeeâ€, to be established by the commission, will be tasked to â€œdraw up, update and circulate for consultation to the providers of broadcasting and transmission services, a written code of broadcasting conduct, to include standards governing the planning of the broadcasting and transmission program, in accordance with the principles of quality, accuracy, public decency, fairness, impartiality, diversity of opinion, right of reply, and avoidance of incitement to hatred and violence.â€ (Art. 79/2) The question here, however, will be how to define and enforce â€œimpartialityâ€ and â€œdiversity of opinionâ€ in a country where all media is partisan, most are connected to a political party, and none have - so far - bothered to obtain a license. Niqash.org has asked international experts for their opinion on the current draft. Some called the draft law &#8220;encouragingâ€ but criticized that it is, overall, often unclearly phrased and thus needs a lot of clarification of details. It often uses â€œtelecommunicationsâ€ and â€œmediaâ€ seemingly interchangeably, yet giving the CMC authority over print media as well without, however, clarifying just what kind of authority that is. It should be made clear, for example, that print media do not require any licenses. Some experts welcome that the law establishes a licensing institution that is independent from the government, but others question the â€œindependenceâ€ of an institution whose board members are appointed by the prime minister. The criteria, according to which licenses and frequencies are to be given (and refused), are not provided at all, although the regulatorsâ€™ agenda is crucial in a wild media landscape were the regulator himself has, so far, been weak and ignored by media outlets which are freely mushrooming far away from what is in general understood a to be independent and non-partisan. Yet the legal framework for journalistic work is not described at all. The law also prescribes disproportionately high penalties for minor infractions, yet there is no provision for due process. Iraqi experts point out that â€œtelecommunicationsâ€ is not â€œmediaâ€ and that the former should be entirely regulated by the Ministry of Telecommunication, and not the CMC. They allege that the CMC wants to keep telecommunication under its control because it is a very lucrative sector of the economy. This is particularly important in view of the fact that the Iraqi mobile phone licenses are up for renewal again soon, and thus the CMC itself has not reason to give up this particular source of income. Thus, while obviously nobody is against a media regulation law, the experts see this draft to be in dire need of revision. Currently, there are two working groups - the Culture and Media Commission of the parliament under leadership of Mufid al-Jazaâ€™iri and one civil society group consisting of all stake-holders (journalists, publishers, media activists, lawmakers) and supported by the well-known NGO â€œArticle 19â€ (2) - collaborating on a general media law that would, for example, also regulate freedom of expression. It will be interesting to see how much power and leeway will be given to the CMC in their draft, which will be presented to parliament in the fall. The CMC has been advised by Albany Associates (3), an international consulting company led by Simon Haselock , the former CPA media commissioner in Iraq who was instrumental in the original set-up of the post-War Iraqi media landscape.

CNBC Launches 24hr Africa Network Africa is to enter the era of rolling news this week when CNBC launches the first 24-hour information network dedicated to coverage of news and business on the continent. CNBC Africa is to go on air from Friday from its main studios in Johannesburg, South Africa, and will also take feeds from bureaus in Lagos, Nairobi and London. The new channel will have a heavy business bias and will feature live broadcasts of the opening and closing of key African markets, including the stock exchanges in Johannesburg, Lagos and Nairobi. Zafar Siddiqi, CNBC Africa chairperson, said the launch of the new channel would be a milestone in African broadcasting. &#8220;This is the first channel of its kind that caters to the information needs of the average viewer as well as to business and investment communities, by providing meaningful analysis behind the headlines, relating to how current events can impact our lives,&#8221; he said. The US-based CNBC already has networks operating in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. &#8220;The global CNBC network reaches 200 million households across the world,&#8221; Siddiqi added. While rollings news networks such as CNN, BBC World and al-Jazeera International are available to television viewers in Africa, none broadcast from studios in Africa. African governments frequently complain about Western coverage of their continent, complaining that it is too often negative and overly-focused on natural disasters.

Having spent a number of years in the business of counting the amount of time that TV news gives to this story or the other, I always found the â€œHereâ€™s What Was Onâ€ function of the job far less interesting than the â€œHereâ€™s Who Covered What Differentlyâ€ angle. So it was with great interest that I read todayâ€™s Project for Excellence in Journalism that summed up the first quarter of this yearâ€™s cable new agenda, breaking down what the three cable networks deemed newsworthy, and to what extent. Itâ€™s not pretty. As much as itâ€™s old hat to raise questions about Fox News Channelâ€™s coverage of political issues, it was still surprising (even to a cynical eye) to see that FNC gave less than half the airtime that MSNBC did to coverage of the war in Iraq &#8212; 15 percent of its airtime versus 31 percent for MSNBC. CNN devoted a quarter of its airtime to the war. Another notable aspect of FNCâ€™s news coverage? According to the report: If Fox was less focused on the Iraq War, what took its place? Mostlyâ€”according to the numbersâ€”Anna Nicole Smith. Coverage of her death trailed just barely the airtime spent on the Iraq policy debate, accounting for 9.6% of all the Fox content studied (versus 10.1% for the Iraq policy debate). Fox also stood out for its lack of coverage on the firings of the U.S. attorneys, compared with the other channels. The story, which gained real momentum in mid March, consumed a mere 2% of Foxâ€™s total airtime. CNN devoted twice that percent (4%) and MSNBC four times (8%). And this information isnâ€™t coming from a partisan source. Itâ€™s coming from the well-regarded Project for Excellence in Journalism. (Though Roger Ailes Itâ€™s easy to play partisan footsie with Fox News Channel about this , but while such anecdotes are interesting â€“ not to mention great fodder for the shoutfests â€“ theyâ€™re not as telling as Actual Data. And todayâ€™s study isnâ€™t the first time that FNC has demonstrated quantifiable news judgement that is, at least, aberrant. Before you file this under editorial discretion, remember the about global perceptions that came out in 2003. In it, participants were asked three questions (that would have correctly been answered â€˜noâ€™): Has it been proven that Saddam was working closely with Al Qaeda before September 11th? Have weapons of mass destruction been found in Iraq? Did world opinion favor America going into Iraq? Later in the study, the researchers compared the answers to these questions against where the participants said they got their news and information from. 80 percent of Fox News Channel viewers answered â€˜yesâ€™ to at least one of these questions. (With 2/3 thinking an Iraq-Al Qaeda link had been proven, 1/3 thinking WMDs had been found in Iraq and 35 percent thinking world opinion supported the invasion.) The smashmouth approach to news that makes the Fox News Channel more attractive and watchable â€“ it , in many dayparts, the most watched â€“ doesnâ€™t seem to lead to more informed viewers. (Though at times itâ€™s debatable how much news is imparted on any of the news networks.) When you score last on viewer comprehension and highest for AnnaMania, itâ€™s time to take a look in the mirror.

The new New Journalism beats up on the old The Globe and Mail One of the most remarkable results of social networking is the redefinition of journalism, if you see social networking on the Web from the point of view of Michael Arrington, the keynote speaker at the Mesh Conference being held in Toronto today and tomorrow. Arrington said he founded Techcrunch.com, a website dedicated to tech news, &#8220;purely for fun,&#8221; but it has now grown into a major and influential site. So he might not have started off as a journalist, but he has become one, or at least something like one &#8212; he confesses that he&#8217;s still not sure what a journalist is.&#8221; But he does know that getting news on his site very quickly is very important. It doesn&#8217;t even matter how accurate it is â€” &#8220;Put it up as soon as possible, then correct it,&#8221; he said. Moreover, his postings are larded with opinion, and &#8220;If I say outrageous things, I get more money.&#8221; When asked by a member of the audience about his responsibility to his readers, he answered simply: &#8220;I try to be fun.&#8221; What&#8217;s more, this philosophy of news gathering is washing back on to traditional journalism, as evidenced by attitudes toward embargoes, a journalistic word meaning an agreement not to o to press with something before an agreed time. The idea is an old one, and was meant to help journalists get a story together with enough time to get it right. But that&#8217;s all changed, Arrington said. &#8220;A lot of bloggers don&#8217;t respect embargoes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and a growing number of print journalists are also not respecting them.&#8221; So if you want to know what happened to credibility in journalism, you know where to start looking. Carrying on a theme started in an earlier part of the current Mesh conference in Toronto, a couple of 20-something entrepreneurs echoed Arrington&#8217;s view that social media are replacing the old. Tom Williams and Austin Hill work in the charity end of entrepreneurship, both having set up and sold a number of other businesses, making them veterans at a tender age. That prompted Williams to preface one slightly negative comment with the warning that he&#8217;s &#8220;afraid of sounding like a curmudgeon at the age of 28.&#8221; Hill said his motivation was a comment someone made after Hill buried a 19-year-olod brother, tragically cut down by cancer. It was time, this friend said, to celebrate his brother&#8217;s life, not his death. And that led him to see his mission as &#8220;How to save the world, one random act of kindness at a time.&#8221; As lofty as that sounded, Hill added a few moments later that &#8220;social media is about monkey see, monkey do,&#8221; and that the way set up an effective online charitable organization is to get people involved in the results of the charity, not the process of raising the money. &#8220;Pulling out your credit card and giving money to a charity is not fun,&#8221; he said. Williams agreed, and added that social networking must change the traditional way of doing things. &#8220;The establishment is entrenched, and needs to let go of its control,&#8221; he said. Both speakers agreed that the agenda of the traditional media is all about delivering bad news, while online charities are about good news. People who donate to online charities can seee the results in a way they cannot in the traditional way of doing theings. &#8220;It&#8217;s the ultimate experiential media,&#8221; Williams said. Beating up on absent friends â€œOld Mediaâ€ â€“ in all their glory â€“ took another beating from the â€œNew Mediaâ€ at the afternoon sessions of the Mesh Conference. Trouble is, no one thought to invite the old media to hear their opinions on the subject. A conference was chaired by Mark Evans, who announced he had made the correct decision to leave the old media for the new when he bolted from the National Post. He presented video blogger Loren Feldman, Huffington Post new media critic Rachel Sklar and emerging-media analyst Cynthia Brumfield, who all agreed that the old media should be cowering before the new, and perhaps should simply throw in the towel. Feldman was the least explosive here, suggesting that newspapers will always have a place, and they will certainly be around for another 200 years. But, he added, they will have to change â€” perhaps whittle themselves down to four pages, a length Feldman evidently feels is about as long as his attention span can handle. Brumfield said that newspapers â€œhave been severely impacted by the Internetâ€ because â€œthey have to hang on to their old distribution methodsâ€ and so will become dinosaurs. She added that â€œ20 or 30 years ago, people were limited to one newspaper a day, but now we have 20 or 30 online.â€ How this passed for truth is perhaps explained by the fact that most of the people in the room had not been very conscious or even born 20 or 30 years ago. There were clearly many more newspapers then, and many households subscribed to two. If people had read only one paper day, it was perhaps because they were limiting themselves to one paper â€” but limiting oneâ€™s reading habits is a function of preference, not availability. Oddly, one theme that ran through this fear-based analysis was that bloggers can, in fact, easily replace news organizations, ousting professional news reporters with freelance amateurs and opinion-mongers who might well have (as Brumfield mentioned) webcams fixed to their heads. Blumfield confessed she had become mesmerized by a cheese-makerâ€™s website in England, which had a webcam trained on a block of cheese and she could watch it age. Iâ€™m not making this up. While most of the discussion was about individuals writing for the social-networking sites, Rachel Sklar didnâ€™t seem to see a conflict between her view of the brave new world of blogging and her work for the HuffingtonPost.com website, funded by the fabulously wealthy and formidable Arianna Huffington. Sklar never addressed the fact that her employer, wealthy and powerful, was more like most of the owners of old media, rather than standing as one of the new media moguls. The next session fared better. Entitled cryptically The Death of Newspapers: Digital Blinders â€” Are We an Inch Wide and a Mile Deep?, the panelists were much more realistic. Never mind that we use the metric system in Canada, and had embraced it before many of the attendees were born. Mark Schneider, a veteran of both old media (as a reporter for CTV news) and new media (heâ€™s now working with the Vancouver-based â€œcitizen journalistâ€ site called Now Public), and Nora Young of CBC Radioâ€™s Definitely Not The Opera, seemed to have a firmer grasp on reality. Schneider, clear-eyed, was the only one to note that no one really knows what the effect of the Internet will be; all around him everyone seemed to be speaking as though the glorious future of New Media is a foregone conclusion. But he said he was much encouraged when he discovered that on his site, at least five bloggers from Lebanon and Israel had discovered each other on Now Public, and formed their own little community, offering many different perspectives. Young was concerned about the effect of the new media on dialectic; she noted that â€œweâ€™re trying to figure out how to construct an argumentâ€ â€” a point I wished she had been allowed to expand upon. Mark Federer, originally of the McLuhan Institute, spoke at great length in fluent McLuhanese, and appeared to be making fine headway framing and reframing the questions he had been given.

Colleagues Honor Slain Russian Journalist With A Book And Demand Justice The independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta on Wednesday officially began sales of a bound collection of articles and commentary by Anna Politkovskaya, its special correspondent who was killed last year, and renewed its demand for an honest investigation of the crime. The public call for justice underscored anew the deep tensions between the remnants of Russiaâ€™s independent news media and the authorities, who have replaced most of the principal outlets of public political dissent with government-controlled programs and Kremlin-friendly content. Ms. Politkovskaya, 48, was one of the fiercest domestic critics to emerge in post-Soviet Russia. With her writing, she campaigned against what she saw as a proliferation of official brutality and corruption in the government under President Vladimir V. Putin and the horrors and endemic crime that have accompanied the wars in Chechnya. In return she was treated as a nonperson, barred from appearing on television and shut out by the Kremlin. She died in October in what was apparently a contract killing, shot several times with a pistol as she entered her apartment building in Moscow after returning from a nearby food store. The case, which is under investigation, is the latest in a line of killings of journalists in Russia that remain without resolution, and it has made her a posthumous symbol of the diminished media freedom here. The collection of her work, a brick-thick volume of 980 pages, bore a photograph of her intent face beside a title of two words: â€œFor What.â€ Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet president and a co-owner of the newspaper to which Ms. Politkovskaya brought fame, joined her editors, friends and family in calling for the crime to be solved. He said the case was especially important because much of Russian society thought that law enforcement officials had been involved in her killing. Using words that did not criticize Mr. Putin directly, Mr. Gorbachev also spoke of Russiaâ€™s need for independent journalists. â€œThere is a great need for such people,â€ he said. â€œMaybe now the need is even greater than before.â€ Mr. Gorbachev later held a copy of the book and suggested that while Ms. Politkovskayaâ€™s writing was painful for some to read â€” it often accused government officials, soldiers and police officers of crimes â€” it was ultimately helpful to the Russian state. â€œIt is bitter,â€ he said. â€œBut it is a medicine.â€ Ms. Politkovskayaâ€™s colleagues at Novaya Gazeta also spoke with frustration about the pace of the official investigation, saying they had cooperated with law enforcement agencies but had not seen a result. They added that they had refrained from publishing materials their own work had turned up, because they did not want to endanger the official case or its sources of information. But they expressed worry that the official investigation would be whitewashed and said that if such a course became evident, they would be compelled to publish their findings. â€œIf we see the political resolution is about to be imposed, we will run all of the material that we have,â€ said Dmitri Muratov, the paperâ€™s editor in chief. The renewed demand for progress in the investigation occurred as the International Federation of Journalists, a Brussels-based private organization, held its congress in another section of the city and faced a continued chill from the Kremlin. The federation said it had selected Moscow for its round of meetings, which it holds every three years, in part to bring attention to the deteriorating environment for independent journalism in Russia. Among the materials circulated at the congress was a booklet with an essay by Igor Yakovenko, general secretary of the Russian Union of Journalists, titled â€œThe Torn Profession.â€ The essay summarized the Kremlinâ€™s control and manipulation of Russiaâ€™s public political dialogue, saying the unionâ€™s monitoring of the Russian news media had found that â€œpro-president and ruling party propaganda amounted to roughly 30 percent of the total amount of informationâ€ in 2000, but rose to 92 percent in 2006. â€œSpin doctors and propagandists, not journalists, are today the face of all federal TV channels,â€ Mr. Yakovenko wrote. Kremlin officials have ignored invitations to attend and speak at the event. Aidan White, general secretary of the international federation, left the congress briefly in the afternoon to lend support to the calls for progress in the investigation of Ms. Politkovskayaâ€™s killing. â€œUnfortunately this is a country that appears to have a culture of impunityâ€ with respect to crimes against journalists, he said. He added that he had heard from Russians this week that every attack against a journalist â€œis fully investigated until it has come to a successful dead end.â€ Not everyone at the event was anti-Kremlin. Mr. Gorbachev struck a distinct line, paying tribute to Ms. Politkovskaya but also speaking in defense of Mr. Putin. The Russian president, he said, saved the country from chaos and set it on the right course. â€œWhat has been done by Putin deserves a high estimate,â€ he said. Press freedom, Mr. Gorbachev added, requires time to develop. He made no comment on the removal of dissent from televised news. As was often the case in recent years with Ms. Politkovskaya, the events on Wednesday passed without official notice. Western journalists and several Russian newspaper reporters were in attendance, but official domestic news sources avoided coverage. After Mr. Putin rose to power, Ms. Politkovskaya was blocked from televised appearances. Consistent with the findings of Mr. Yakovenkoâ€™s essay, the release of the book and the call for an honest investigation were not mentioned on the evening news. &#8211; By C. J.

Gorbachev Launches New Book By Slain Putin Critic Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on Wednesday hosted the launch of a new book by murdered Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, the first by her to be widely available in her native land and language. Politkovskaya, a critic of President Vladimir Putin and reporter of human rights abuses in Chechnya, was shot dead last October at the entrance to her central Moscow apartment block as she returned from a Saturday afternoon shopping trip. Investigators say her unsolved murder was linked to her reporting. Gorbachev, 76, hosted the launch at his political institute in Moscow alongside Politkovskaya&#8217;s son, daughter and estranged husband, who edited the book. &#8220;Anna may have died, but she is still with us and it (the book) is very important because we need to know more about people like her, especially in a country which is still trying to find its way,&#8221; Gorbachev told the press briefing. Politkovskaya&#8217;s death sparked outrage in the West but little emotion in Russia, where previous books by her were never properly published. Her reports appeared only in the fringe intellectual newspaper &#8216;Novaya Gazeta&#8217;, part owned by Gorbachev. &#8220;It&#8217;s very important that this work is in Russian,&#8221; Politkovskaya&#8217;s 28-year-old son Ilya said. &#8220;My mother&#8217;s only book in Russian was in 2002 and was called &#8216;The Second Chechen War&#8217;. But there were problems printing it and distributing it.&#8221; The 988-page hardback book, entitled &#8220;What for&#8221; and priced at around 600 roubles ($14), arranges work by Politkovskaya around different themes. On Wednesday the prominence given to Politkovskaya&#8217;s book at shops in Moscow varied. At the Moscow Bookstore near Red Square, one of the Russian capital&#8217;s most famous and mainstream bookshops, about six copies of Politkovskaya&#8217;s book had been jammed into the political memoirs section. Further along the same shopping street, at an alternative bookshop, Politkovaskaya&#8217;s face stared out at passers-by from the large window display for the new book. Friends and colleagues at the launch criticized the slow pace of the investigation into her death. &#8220;It&#8217;s essential that the investigation is brought to a swift conclusion, the killers are found, they are prosecuted and justice is delivered,&#8221; said Aidan White, General-Secretary of the worldwide journalists&#8217; union the International Federation of Journalists, to applause from Gorbachev and others. White was in Moscow to attend a conference which called on governments to do more to catch reporters&#8217; killers. In the background a projector displayed a series of black and white photos spanning Politkovskaya&#8217;s life. The last showed the thin, tall 48-year-old striding into a supermarket hours before she was shot dead. &#8211; By James Kilner Share and save this post: These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages. Venezuela, RCTV, And Media Freedom: Just The Facts, Please Lessons In Curtailing Media Freedom There are a number of ways to curtail press freedom. You can charge a journalist with murder and put him on death row-Mumia Abu-Jamal, for instance. You can grant special favors, privileges, and access to corporate media giants while raiding and shutting down low-power, independent radio stations, which the FCC does with some regularity. You could arrest independent journalists at anti-war demonstrations-again, a regular occurrence. For instance, I recall my friend and Indy journalist, Jeff Imig, who has been repeatedly threatened with arrest, while recording anti-war demonstrations in Tucson, Arizona, for violating the statute against filming federal buildings. Jeff finally got arrested-for jaywalking! Corporate press, on the other hand, seems to have free reign to jaywalk and film federal buildings at these same events-behavior I and countless others have witnessed! And then there is the Mother of All Media Manipulations: the blackout engineered by the Bush administration which blocks media from showing the arrival of body bags and coffins of newly dead soldiers &#8220;coming home&#8221; from Iraq. Those are some pretty good ways of curtailing freedom of speech. And they&#8217;re each and everyone home grown right here in the good ol&#8217; United States of America. So what&#8217;s the deal with Venezuela, anyway? So, pardon me if I&#8217;m just a little astounded by all this noise in the media, the Bush administration, the Senate and the House, about how Venezuela is &#8220;attacking&#8221; free speech and independent media by not renewing the broadcasting license of RCTV. Perhaps even more disturbing is that this ridiculous assertion is being repeated even among some persons on the Left. Just last week the Senate passed a condemnation of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez&#8217; refusal to renew the license. Senate Resolution 211 was sponsored by Richard Lugar, (R-IN) and Christopher Dodd (D-CT), with vocal, and disappointing, support from presidential contenders Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and Barak Obama (D-IL). Rep. Jerry Weller (R-IL) has introduced similar legislation into the House. Puerto Rico&#8217;s delegate to the House, Republican Luis Fortuno has outspokenly supported this legislation, which is surprising, considering his complete lack of action or outcry when the FBI was harassing Puerto Rican journalists in 2006. Anyway, who says bipartisanship is dead? Joining in these condemnations are a whole host of so-called &#8220;press freedom&#8221; advocates, lead by the National Endowment for Democracy funded Reporters Without Borders. One would think that the iron hand has fallen and the crackdown has begun in Venezuela. Corporate media seems to regularly forget that along with freedom of press is the responsibility of presenting facts to back up their news reporting. Well, dear reader, you are in for a rare treat-a discussion of some actual facts. The general situation is this: In April of 2002, there was a two-day, illegal coup carried out against Venezuela&#8217;s electoral government, which involved the kidnapping and jailing of President Hugo Chavez. There were four major media outlets, along with others, who actively aided and abetted this coup (more later). In the intervening five years, none of them were closed, nor were any of their journalists incarcerated. Rather, the Chavez administration met with them, not to change their editorial slant, but to reach agreements preventing a repeat of such anti-democratic measure and the hyperbolic misrepresentation of facts, and also to discourage such continued infractions as the airing of pornography and cigarette commercials. Another important fact is that the heads of the media-monopoly in Venezuela, including Marcel Granier -owner of RCTV, also participated in the economic sabotage that occurred between 2002-2003. Yet, no one went to prison for endangering the country&#8217;s social and economic stability. What is truly amazing is that it has taken five years for the Chavez administration to take action in any way against media that helped carry out this coup. Certainly, if the same thing happened in the United States, it wouldn&#8217;t be tolerated. Just ask Aaron Burr or Timothy McVeigh what happens when folks plot against the existing, elected government. The fact is.you don&#8217;t get away with it, you get punished, and pretty severely. Getting their broadcasting licenses renewed would be the least of their problems. When RCTV&#8217;s broadcasting license came up for review, Pres. Chavez decided, after exhaustive research and study, not to renew the license. Chavez is legally responsible for renewing such licenses under laws which were enacted before he became president. The reasons given for not renewing the license cite RCTV&#8217;s participation in the coup, plus the fact that RCTV leads Venezuelan media in infractions of communications laws. RCTV&#8217;s problems pre-date the Chavez administration, having been censured and closed repeatedly in previous presidential administrations. RCTV leads Venezuela in its violation of communications codes, with 652 infractions. Another interesting fact is that our corporate media and distinguished Members of Congress have neglected to mention that on April of 2007 the government of Peru did not renew the broadcasting licenses of two TV stations and three radio stations for breaking their Radio and Television laws. It is obvious that Venezuela continues to be a target. What, then, are the facts behind the charges made by the Chavez administration? On the morning of April 11th, 2002, the first day of the coup, the anti-Bolivarian opposition had started a march from the headquarters of the state owned oil company. Across town, supporters of the Bolivarian Revolution were gathered outside the presidential palace. Breaking with its previously announced plan, the opposition changed directions and headed to the presidential palace, greatly increasing the chances of a violent confrontation between the two opposing sides. During the midst of this confusion, shots rang out from the rooftops, where snipers were firing on both crowds, resulting in the deaths of 18 persons, with 150 wounded. Reports on the opposition&#8217;s four largest TV stations indicated the violence was the result of pro-Bolivarian gunmen, and this became the immediate catalyst &#8220;justifying&#8221; the coup. However, the testimony of eyewitnesses and videos taken from other angles show that a much different scenario was actually taking place. The following transcript is excerpted from the video documentary, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, which was produced for television in Ireland. It sheds important light on the sequence of events. Note particularly the quotation included from RCTV News Correspondent, Andre Cesara. NARRATOR: The opposition march was fast approaching and some in the vanguard seemed ready for a fight. With thousands of Chavez supporters still surrounding the palace a confrontation seemed imminent. Then at about 2:00 p.m., we saw the opposition march arrive. The army tried to act as a buffer between the two groups. [shouting] NARRATOR: We moved back into the heart of the Chavez crowds when all of a sudden the firing started. [sirens] NARRATOR: We couldn&#8217;t tell where the shots were coming from, but people were being hit in the head. [gunshots] NARRATOR: Soon it became clear that we were being shot at by snipers. One in four Venezuelans carry hand guns and soon some of the Chavez supporters began to shoot back in the direction the sniper fire seemed to be coming from. WITNESS (in Spanish): One of the channels had a camera opposite the palace that captured images of people shooting from the bridge. It looks like they are shooting at the opposition march below, but you can see them, they themselves are ducking. They are clearly being shot at, but the shots of them ducking were never shown. The Chavez supporters were blamed. The images were manipulated and shown over and over again to say that Chavez supporters had assassinated innocent marchers. ANDRE CESARA, RCTV journalist (in Spanish): Look at that Chavez supporter. Look at him empty his gun. That Chavez supporter has just fired on the unarmed peaceful protesters below. NARRATOR: What the TV stations didn&#8217;t broadcast was this camera angle which clearly shows the streets below were empty. The opposition march had never taken that route. With this manipulation, the deaths could now be blamed on Chavez. There is no doubt, and no dispute, that RCTV and the three other largest corporate television stations (Globovision, Venevision, and Televen) aided and abetted the ensuing coup throughout the three day period it was being carried out. They knowingly broadcast false and manipulated information, including the lies that Bolivarian supporters instigated violence against demonstrators, and that Pres. Chavez, as a result, had willingly resigned and left the country. Pres. Chavez had not resigned. He had been kidnapped and was being held prisoner by traitors within the Venezuelan military. During all this, RCTV hosted coup plotters, including co-leader Carlos Ortega of the corrupt and US government supported labor union, the CTV, and had broadcast Ortega&#8217;s appeal rallying demonstrators to march on the presidential palace. RCTV and its partners undertook a complete blackout on reporting any news relating to the more than a million citizens who had taken to the street and surrounded the presidential palace in defense of the democratically elected government of Venezuela. Rather than broadcasting this news, RCTV treated its viewers to reruns of Tom and Jerry cartoons and the movie Pretty Woman. Vice-Admiral Ramirez Perez spoke for all his fellow coup plotters when told a Venevision reporter, &#8220;We had a deadly weapon: the media. And now that I have the opportunity, let me congratulate you.&#8221; His congratulations were premature, however, as multitudes of people in the street, with the aid of truly independent, community based media and patriots within the Venezuelan military were able to defeat this coup without firing a shot, returning Pres. Chavez to his rightful office on April 13, 2002. On the Job at RCTV-Eyewitness, Andres Izarra Speaks If any doubts remain as to RCTV&#8217;s complicity in this coup, the voice of one of its own producers should lay them all to rest. Andres Izarra had worked as the assignment editor in charge of Latin America for CNN before being hired by RCTV as news production manager for Venezuela&#8217;s highest ranked newscast, El Observador. Izarra says, quite clearly, &#8220;We were told no pro-Chavez material was to be screened&#8221;. Later, RCTV officials would maintain that they could not film pro-Bolivarian demonstrations for security reasons. Even if that were true, Izarra notes, footage of these demonstrations was available from sources such as CNN. RCTV also continued broadcasting reports that President Chavez had willfully resigned and left the country, even though Izarra notes that they were receiving news to the contrary, and that Mexico, Argentina, and France had all issued statements condemning the coup and refusing to recognize the new government. Conversely, the United States welcomed this illegal government. Izarra says the last straw came for him when, &#8220;We had a reporter in Miraflores and knew that it had been retaken by the Chavistas.[but] the information blackout stood. That&#8217;s when it was enough for me, and I decided to leave&#8221;. Asked what he thought the response should be to this level of disinformation, Izarra replied, &#8220;I think their licenses should be revoked&#8221;. Having had enough of corporate media&#8217;s complicity in blocking news reportage, Izarra now serves as head of Telesur, the joint news channel broadcast by the nations of Venezuela, Argentina, Bolivia, and Cuba. As Patrick McElwee, of Just Foreign Policy, points out: &#8220;It is frankly amazing that this company has been allowed to broadcast for 5 years after the coup, and that the Chavez government waited until its license expired to end its use of the public airwaves.&#8221; Despite their participation in the coup, the Chavez administration entered into repeated negotiations with RCTV and its partners, Venevision, Globovision, and Television to make sure that such crass manipulation of the news would not occur again, and about other infractions. RCTV refused to reach any agreements. Despite the nonrenewal of its broadcasting license, cable and satellite broadcasts will still be available to RCTV; moreover they will continue to broadcast through their two radio stations in Venezuela. The new broadcasting license is being given to a public station, TVes-Venezuela Social Television, which will run shows produced mainly by independent parties. The station will be controlled not by the government, but by a foundation of community members, with one chair reserved for a government representative. TVes also hopes to reach into some of the most remote areas of the nation, not covered before by RCTV. The coup government and media freedom-an alternative? There is, indeed, an example that shows a real alternative to how Pres. Chavez and the Bolivarian movement deals with freedom of the media and freedom of speech. The two-day coup government of Pedro Carmona revealed that alternative. But, first, let&#8217;s quickly review the general state of media freedom in Venezuela under the presidency of Hugo Chavez. Shortly after Chavez became president, media law was reformed so that it became legal for anyone who could broadcast to do so. In the United States, many fans of underground and independent radio speak fondly of &#8220;pirate&#8221; radio-low powered, but illegal stations broadcast from small, &#8220;renegade&#8221; transmitters. There are no &#8220;pirate&#8221; radio stations in Venezuela, because such stations are legal. Rather, there is a significant Community Media movement-community based and non-profit media production centers run locally by community volunteers. Corporate and opposition media also have great freedom in Venezuela. In fact, the radio and television airwaves, and the print media as well, continue to be dominated by corporations which support the opposition. There is no shortage of negative opinions and portrayals of Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution-in fact, these remain the standard among the for-profit news and entertainment industry. This concept is strange to those of us in the United States, where official party lines and major news sources are virtually indistinguishable from each other. But while corporate and community media both retain enormous freedoms in Venezuela, the April 11-13th, 2002 coup, and the two day coup government, provide a much different example. Once interloper Pedro Carmona had declared himself President of Venezuela, among the very first actions taken by the coup government involved the suppression of Venezuela&#8217;s non-corporate media. Police troops answering to Carmona raided and shut down Channel 8, the government TV station. They ordered the Catholic Church&#8217;s Radio Fe y Alegria to play only music and not report national events, lest they also be shut down. Carmona&#8217;s raiders also hit a number of Community Media centers, closing down, among others, TV Caricua, Catia TV, and Radio Perola. Fortunately, reporters from Catia TV and Radio Perola were able to escape and recapture their transmitters. Because of this, they were able to provide mobile broadcasts to the people of Venezuela of the news that RCTV and its partners were blacking out. Another action taken by the Carmona government was to release the persons who had been arrested in connection with the sniper attacks that instigated the coup. Instead, coup forces arrested independent journalist Nicolas Rivera and accused him of participating in these attacks. The only weapon Rivera had had with him during these demonstrations was a tape recorder-obviously considered a threat by coup plotters. Rivera was freed after the two-day coup was defeated and democratic government was reestablished. However, the scars of his detention remained, with his face disfigured by the torture he had endured while incarcerated. Rivera&#8217;s wife said that the forces that raided their home planted a sack of bullets on Rivera, beat both of them, and threatened to kill their children. Yet despite these attacks and threats to this journalist and his family, not one, single international organization in &#8220;defense&#8221; of press freedoms spoke out on behalf of Rivera. Perhaps it was in this case that Reporters Without Borders found its border. Also silent about these attacks on freedom of speech and press were both houses of the US Congress, both parties, the Bush administration..no, there was no resolution of any kind condemning the attacks by the coup government on these freedoms. Could that be because coup leaders were funded by Congress, via USAID and the so-called National Endowment for Democracy, and were aided, abetted, and advised by the Bush Administration, the State Department, and the US military? Just maybe these factors were an influence. While Representatives and Senators weep bipartisan crocodile tears about supposed threats to media rights in Venezuela; while US and Venezuelan corporate press crow about the &#8220;unfair&#8221; targeting of RCTV; while even some segments of the US Left express &#8220;concern&#8221; about press freedoms in Venezuela; an examination of the facts leads one to this clear conclusion: these folks are full of a substance that emanates from the hind end of a male bovine. Fact: not renewing the broadcasting license of coup plotters, lawbreakers, and liars like RCTV is the kind of thing it takes to defend Venezuela and make it the haven of free speech, free media, and participatory democracy that it is today.

Waving a $5 billion bouquet and blowing kisses from puckered lips, Rupert Murdoch has now been wooing the Bancroft family for the hand of Dow Jones & Co. for more than a month. In his entreaty to the family, the old goat vowed that on becoming owner, he would never defile any Dow Jones title, writing: Maintaining the heritage of independence and journalistic integrity of the and Dow Jones&#8217; other publications would be of utmost importance to me and to News Corporation. That&#8217;s a lovely thought to express in the rutting heat of courtship, but could Murdoch be trusted to do the right thing once he became owner of the world&#8217;s leading financial daily and its sister publications? For starters, could he and his management team come close to upholding the Dow Jones code of conduct , which applies to all Dow Jones employees? Give the code a gander. Dow Jones places the highest premium on telling its customers the truth. &#8220;If we are not telling them the truthâ€”or even if they, for any valid reason, believe that we are notâ€”then Dow Jones cannot prosper,&#8221; the code states. It continues: The Company will suffer, for example, if our customers cannot assume that: Our facts are accurate and fairly presented; Our analyses represent our best independent judgments rather than our preferences, or those of our sources, advertisers or information providers; Our opinions represent only our own editorial philosophies; or There are no hidden agendas in any of our journalistic undertakings. Setting aside for a moment Murdoch&#8217;s many skills and accomplishments, he&#8217;s not particularly interested in the accurate and fair presentation of facts. He believes the rest of the press is liberal and that the conservative swing of his Fox News Channel and exist to correct that bias. He has routinely used his publications to help elect British politicians (John Major and Tony Blair) and his enterprises to advance personal business and political interests. (The predicted last year that once Blair stepped down from office, Murdoch would reward him with a seat on the News Corp. board. We shall see. For more of Murdoch&#8217;s mucking about, see these previous columns: &#8220; The Murdoch Street Journal Eight More Reasons to Distrust Murdoch Murdoch Lies to the Financial Times Murdoch&#8217;s politicking is so transparent that it&#8217;s hard to accuse him of pursing &#8220;hidden agendas.&#8221; Once it became politically expedient, he was happy to host a political fundraiser for the liberal Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) in . In 2004, he arranged a similar event for liberal Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Murdoch isn&#8217;t bad for journalism because he&#8217;s a conservative. He&#8217;s bad for journalism because he has principles. In any event, Murdoch&#8217;s political activism violates the Dow Jones code of conduct. It states unequivocally: Dow Jones does not contribute, directly or indirectly, to political campaigns or to political parties or groups seeking to raise money for political campaigns or parties. â€¦ All news employees and members of senior management with any responsibility for news should refrain from partisan political activity judged newsworthy by their senior editor or in the case of senior management, the Chief Executive Officer. Murdoch attempts to assuage Brancroft family worries that he&#8217;ll run roughshod over the by promising in his May 11 letter to buffer his influence over the paper by creating an &#8220;autonomous editorial board&#8221; akin to the one that presides over his of London. The board would approve the sacking or hiring of either the editor or managing editor of the and would arbitrate disputes &#8220;between management and editors.&#8221; If insulating Murdoch from the is such a great idea, why hasn&#8217;t he instituted similarly autonomous editorial boards to shield the operations of the and Fox News Channel from his whims? But that&#8217;s not the Murdoch way. A Page One story in the Feb. 14, 1994, portrays Murdoch as a details-crazed micromanager, reviewing before publication the next day&#8217;s editorial in his A wordy section of the Dow Jones code of conduct prohibits company employees from accepting money or gifts, either directly or indirectly, from anybody seeking a mention in the pages of a Dow Jones publication. A different code operated at Murdoch&#8217;s until earlier this month when the paper that its &#8220;Page Six&#8221; editor, Richard Johnson, had accepted a $1,000 gift from a restaurateur. Presumably the money was for &#8220;play&#8221; in the pages of Murdoch&#8217;s newspaper. The 15 favorable &#8220;Page Six&#8221; mentions of the restaurateur or his establishment in the two years since the gift-giving. Once confronted, how did Murdoch&#8217;s clear the ethical air? Don&#8217;t be dense. Its editor, Col Allen, called the receipt of the gift a &#8220;grave mistake,&#8221; meted out an unspecified reprimand to Johnson, and explicitly banned such future windfalls for employees. But don&#8217;t blame Johnson and Allen for their ethical laxity. Boss Murdoch sets low standards for the whole company. They merely follow. Does Murdoch pass the Dow Jones stink test? He&#8217;s not even qualified to take it. Share and save this post: These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages. Citizens group fights to see payment details of papers&#8217; pact The owners of Seattle&#8217;s two daily newspapers may have agreed to settle their four-year legal dispute, but they aren&#8217;t out of court yet. The third party in the long-running lawsuit asked a judge Tuesday to grant it access to details about the settlement that The Seattle Times Co. and The Hearst Corp. so far have refused to disclose. In its motion, the Committee for a Two-Newspaper Town (CTNT) expressed concern that, while the settlement appears to keep both papers alive, The Times and Hearst, owner of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, may have a secret deal to close down one later. The group said the companies had rebuffed its attempts to obtain the information informally, while at the same time suggesting the committee drop its legal claims against The Times and Hearst. &#8220;Either they have something to hide, or not,&#8221; the committee&#8217;s motion states. P-I Publisher Roger Oglesby and Kelly Corr, one of Hearst&#8217;s Seattle lawyers, said they had not yet seen the committee&#8217;s motion and would have no comment. Times spokeswoman Jill Mackie did not respond to requests for comment. King County Superior Court Judge Greg Canova could rule on the request as soon as next Wednesday. Kathy George, one of the committee&#8217;s lawyers, said the group is particularly interested in the breakdown of a $49 million payment The Times is making to Hearst as part of the settlement. The settlement agreement indicates some is for Hearst dropping its claims against The Times, and some is for Hearst agreeing to change the joint-operating agreement (JOA) between the companies to eliminate language that would have allowed the New York-based company to collect 32 percent of The Times&#8217; profits until 2083 if it closed the P-I. But the precise numbers are redacted â€” edited out â€” of versions of the agreement provided to the committee and the public. The group said it wants to know how much Hearst is getting to give up the 32 percent. &#8220;CTNT has good reason to fear that the new, instant payoff might simply be compensation in advance for voluntary closure [of the P-I] in the future,&#8221; the motion reads. &#8220;The amount of the payoff would shed light on the newspapers&#8217; motivations &#8230; .&#8221; Or The Times and Hearst may have a private deal under which Hearst would buy The Times and close down the smaller P-I, the committee&#8217;s motion suggests. Hearst has first right to buy the Blethen Corp.&#8217;s majority interest in The Times Co., a stake Times Publisher Frank Blethen has said repeatedly isn&#8217;t for sale. The settlement agreement says the companies have agreed to nothing that isn&#8217;t included in documents made public, albeit some in redacted form. George said she has no evidence that&#8217;s not true. &#8220;I just wonder why the newspapers are so reluctant, at this point and in this context, to cooperate with us,&#8221; she said. If Canova grants the committee&#8217;s motion, George said, it may also want to question Times and Hearst executives. &#8220;We think it&#8217;s prudent to make sure we know everything.&#8221; Under the JOA, in place since 1983, The Times and P-I have separate news operations, but The Times handles the business and production side for both in return for a larger share of the combined proceeds. The Times moved in 2003 to trigger an escape clause in the JOA contract that could have led to the P-I&#8217;s closure. Hearst sued. The Committee for a Two-Newspaper Town organized weeks later, and Canova allowed it to intervene in the lawsuit, saying it appeared to represent the public interest. The companies later agreed to submit their dispute to binding arbitration. The settlement was announced April 16 as the arbitration hearing was about to begin. In addition to the $49 million payment from The Times to Hearst and elimination of the 32 percent provision, the agreement prohibits The Times from triggering the escape clause again for at least nine years. In return, Hearst is to pay The Times $25 million. The settlement appeared to both achieve the Committee for a Two-Newspaper Town&#8217;s goal â€” keeping both newspapers alive â€” and eliminate the basis for its chief claim. The group had challenged the JOA&#8217;s 32 percent provision, saying it was an unconstitutional restraint of trade and a disincentive for Hearst to keep publishing the P-I. But the group refused to declare victory, saying it would scrutinize the documents. In the motion it filed Tuesday, the group noted that Hearst and The Times didn&#8217;t reveal the existence of the settlement agreement for several days after announcing a deal, instead disclosing only a proposed revised JOA. Given that history, &#8220;CTNT is justified in its concern that the newspapers may be hiding something,&#8221; the motion reads. It also cites Oglesby&#8217;s refusal to say Hearst will continue to publish the P-I for nine more years, and Blethen&#8217;s comments that he remains skeptical the JOA&#8217;s economics can work.

Chronicle Says New Media Responsible for Sub Par News Haven&#8217;t you heard? News is declining. At least, according to Neil Henry in this morning&#8217;s The factors behind this shrinkage are sadly familiar: The rise of the Internet has produced sharp declines in traditional advertising revenues in the printed press. Free online advertising competitors such as Craigslist.com have sharply undermined classified advertising as a traditional source of revenue. . .As a result, newspapers such as The Chronicle must make staff cuts to survive &#8212; and increasingly it is highly skilled professional journalists committed to seeking the truth and reporting it, independently and without fear or favor, who must go. Although I can understand Henry&#8217;s frustrations with the changing climate of the newspaper business, I think his ire is misguided. According to Henry, everything from news aggregators like Google and Yahoo and even Craigslist are to blame for the impending exodus of skilled reporters. Although this may be accurate on a financial level as far as revenue loss is concerned, it&#8217;s a far cry from making new media culpable for old media&#8217;s reluctance to evolve. Old media isn&#8217;t losing its journalists because the public no longer values accurate news. It&#8217;s losing its journalists because new media has found a cheaper way to provide advertising&#8211;which is a newspaper&#8217;s lifeblood as far as revenue is concerned. A good example of this would be Craigslist. It undermines traditional print classifieds by offering the service for free&#8211;and to a larger audience, no less. If I wanted a tacky plaid lamp to go with my tacky plaid sofa, and I wanted to find it from London, I could do so with a few clicks of the mouse. That sense of immediacy (and the negligible cost) doesn&#8217;t even compare to the slow speed and clunkiness of print classifieds. It&#8217;s no one&#8217;s fault really&#8211;things have just evolved. In terms of the quality of the news, I don&#8217;t really buy into Henry&#8217;s slippery slope either. He describes the potential effects of the Chronicle layoffs as so: When journalists&#8217; jobs are eliminated, especially as many as The Chronicle intends, the product is inevitably less than it was. The fact is there will be nothing on YouTube, or in the blogosphere, or anywhere else on the Web to effectively replace the valuable work of those professionals. Just because The Chronicle is losing ad revenue to news aggregates, doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that a smaller reporter pool will ultimately produce sub par news. Not only is that unnecesarilly damning to everyone that isn&#8217;t laid off, but it also assumes that the people who leave The Chronicle won&#8217;t take their top notch reporting elsewhere. Getting laid off can definitely be devastating, but I seriously doubt that these people will never use their reporting or editorial talents elsewhere. A reporter switching publications or even working in the blogosphere isn&#8217;t unheard of you know&#8230; Ultimately, Henry&#8217;s letter is but another chapter in the on-going old media vs. new media battle, but to put things in perspective, I think it&#8217;s fitting to leave off with some advice from Rupert Murdoch that I blogged about a few weeks ago . In light of old media&#8217;s need to adapt Murdoch said: Quality is more important than ever, because the marketplace is more ruthlessly competitive. Options are not merely one click of the remote away; devices undreamed of a few short decades ago are at least as tempting as a change of the channel. Old media can survive&#8211;and thrive&#8211;in this new environment, but they must adapt. We must learn how younger generations of consumers prefer to receive their news and entertainment, and we must meet those expectations.

Residents of Sadr City, the northern suburb that is a stronghold of the al-Mahdi Army, the Shia militia suspected of carrying out the abductions, said that an early morning helicopter strike had killed two people while US commanders said two suspected terrorists had been detained. Dozens of Bradley fighting vehicles and Humvees carried US troops into the Shia district last night where they continued their so-far fruitless house-to-house searches. A cleric who runs the Sadr City political office of Hojatoleslam Moqtada al-Sadr, the spiritual head of the al-Mahdi Army, said his building was stormed at 3am. Witnesses said the two people who died were an elderly couple sleeping on their roof to avoid the heat. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said there had been no major overnight developments in the search for the four British security guards and an IT consultant who were taken hostage in carefully planned raid on the Iraqi Finance Ministry on Tuesday. Fears are growing for abducted Britons SAS team is diverted to join hunt Iraq holds breath before vital summer However, in a sign of the tension in the capital, the British Embassy in Baghdad updated its travel advice for the region, advising British citizens to reassess their security arrangements with the warning that "further kidnaps may be planned". In London, the FCO spokeswoman said that Kim Howells, the Foreign Office Minister, was in Basra yesterday and discussed the operation to secure their release with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Hoshiyar Zebari. The Iraqi Government then released a statement saying that a special military unit had been set up to help the search and that it had "undertaken urgent measures to determine the facts and locate the kidnappers... The government condemns this crime and is doing all it can to ensure the immediate release of the kidnapped Britons". The FCO spokeswoman said that the British diplomats and military officials in charge of the operation were keeping their minds open as to which insurgent group might have been responsible for the kidnapping, despite a leaked incident report that appeared to point the finger of blame at the al-Mahdi Army, whose Basra leader was killed in a joint British and Iraqi operation last week. "There is obviously lots of speculation but we have to keep an open mind and deal in facts rather than pick one theory over another," she said. The report, obtained by the Associated Press, was reportedly written by Fatih-Allah, the director general of the Finance Ministry&rsquo;s data processing center, where the Britons were seized, and quoted the top US Commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, saying that the al-Mahdi Army &ldquo;will be profoundly sorry" if it carried out the abductions. The account of the kidnapping said that Iraq&rsquo;s Defence and Interior ministers believed the al-Mahdi Army of being behind the raid and corroborated other witness reports, which described gunmen claiming to be from the Government's anti-corruption body taking the hostages away in a convoy of 19 four-wheel-drive vehicles. The report said that a group of four men in civilian clothes reportedly scouted the Finance Ministry building 15 minutes before the larger party arrived. The five Britons were taken as one of them, a computer expert, was giving a lecture to Iraqi employees as part of a $184 million US development contract held by BearingPoint, a American consultancy, to encourage the growth of the Iraqi economy. His four bodyguards, from GardaWorld, a Montreal-based security firm, were apparently duped into lowering their weapons. The al-Mahdi Army is under close scrutiny after the reappearance in Iraq last Friday of Hojatoleslam al-Sadr, their young and charismatic leader, who has been in hiding for the last four months during the massive US-Iraqi security operation considered a last-ditch attempt to stabilise the country. The militia has been reportedly frayed by the cleric's absence, fuelling speculation that the Britons were taken by an extremist splinter group. Meanwhile other reports have claimed that the kidnapping bore the hallmark of Sunni insurgents and that the al-Mahdi Army is not involved at all. In another operation in Baghdad today, US forces, backed by helicopter gunships, fought for several hours with armed men suspected of ties to al-Qaeda. Reports said that al-Qaeda militants, who consider Baghdad&rsquo;s Amariyah neighborhood part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, opened fire on students about to attend their final exams. Iraqi police said that 45 men were detained and the local leader of the militants, known as Haji Hameed, was killed. There was no comment from the US military. Outside the capital, up to 25 people were killed and 50 were wounded when a suicide bomber blew up a police recruiting centre in Fallujah, in unstable Anbar province 65km (40 miles) west of Baghdad. The recruiting centre, in a primary school, had opened on Sunday. Meanwhile the US military announced the deaths of three more soldiers in Iraq, bringing the death toll for American troops in May to 122, making it the deadliest month of the war since the assault on Fallujah in November 2004. * Town / City Save to my times Hunt for Britons goes on amid Iraqi violence Who let the kidnappers in, and who let them out?

He assailed the United States and other NATO members for failing to ratify an amended version of the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, which limits the deployment of heavy non-nuclear weapons around the continent. "We have signed and ratified the CFE and are fully implementing it. We have pulled out all our heavy weapons from the European part of Russia to (locations) behind the Ural Mountains and cut our military by 300,000 men," Putin said. "And what about our partners? They are filling Eastern Europe with new weapons. A new base in Bulgaria, another one in Romania, a (missile defense) site in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic," he said. "What we are supposed to do? We can't just sit back and look at that." Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly rejected U.S. assurances that the planned missile defense installations are meant to counter a potential threat from nations such as and pose no danger to Russia. Putin reaffirmed his warning that Russia would opt out of the CFE treaty altogether if NATO nations fail to ratify its amended version. "Either you ratify the treaty and start observing it, or we will opt out of it," Putin said. In remarks clearly directed against Washington, Putin blasted those "who want to dictate their will to all others regardless of international norms and law." "It's dangerous and harmful," he added. "Norms of the international law were replaced with political expediency. We view it as diktat and imperialism." Russia this week initiated an international conference to be held in Austria in early June to discuss the situation around the CFE treaty. Putin described the tests of new missiles conducted by Russia on Tuesday as a necessary response to the Western action. "There is no reason to fear these actions by Russia, they aren't aggressive. It's merely a response to tough and unfounded unilateral actions by our partners," he said. "These actions are aimed at preserving a global balance." In one missile test Tuesday, a prototype of new Russia's intercontinental ballistic missile, called the RS-24, was fired from a mobile launcher at the Plesetsk launch site in northwestern Russia and its test warhead landed on target 3,400 miles away on the Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, officials said. Russia's military also tested a new cruise missile based on the existing short-range Iskander missile. "We will keep modernizing our potential," Putin said.

They explained in elaborate detail why Thai Rak Thai (TRT), the largest, was being disbanded, whereas its main opponent, the Democrat party, was cleared of all charges. However, the elegance of their legal arguments may be lost on millions of Thais. They gave TRT sweeping election victories in 2001 and 2005 and probably still support the party and its leader, Thaksin Shinawatra. As voters may see it, the country's most popular party has been destroyed by a court set up by the military junta that seized power last year, claiming to be rescuing democracy. A week before the tribunal's rulings, Thailand's revered King Bhumibol intervened, giving warning that his realm was &#8220;close to sinking&#8221; and noting that &#8220;political parties must exist&#8221;. This raised hopes that the tribunal would stop short of dissolving either main party, and punish only individual politicians. Those hopes have been dashed. In four months of hearings, the tribunal examined allegations of misbehaviour by the accused parties during a snap election Mr Thaksin had called in April last year. The Democrats and other parties boycotted the election, claiming it would be unfair. The courts later found grounds to annul the results, after the king urged them to sort out the &#8220;mess&#8221;. TRT was accused among other things of bribing small parties to take part in the election, while the Democrats were accused of inducing leaders of smaller parties to make false accusations against TRT. After the coup, the junta, led by the army chief, General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, replaced the Constitutional Court with a new tribunal, whose judges it selected, and told it to pursue the electoral-fraud cases. The junta also appointed an interim government of old soldiers and bureaucrats; and created a temporary parliament and another unelected body to write a new constitution. The generals also set up investigations into the allegations of corruption and abuse of power by the Thaksin administration, while their interim government sought to borrow some of its policies, such as cheap health care and development funds for rural villages, which had made &#8220;Thaksinomics&#8221; so popular. However, although the corruption investigations have unearthed enough evidence to press charges, they failed to find enough of a &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; to wreck Mr Thaksin's reputation irreparably. Meanwhile, the interim government has dithered and bungled, dragging down the economy and making Thaksinomics, for all its other flaws, look good. And Mr Thaksin, through a series of stunts such as bidding for Britain's Manchester City football club, has ensured he is not forgotten. This week's judgment would appear to eliminate TRT and prevent any comeback by Mr Thaksin and his henchmen. But the generals are far from being in the clear. Lesser figures in TRT may regroup and find ways to recapture the party's millions of votes, in the elections the junta promises to hold by the year's end. That is if things get that far. The junta's constitution-writing body has already backtracked on several undemocratic clauses it tried to slip into the new charter, such as permitting an unelected prime minister and allowing for a &#8220;crisis council&#8221;, including military chiefs, to step in and solve political conflicts. But other unpopular provisions&#8212;such as having the Senate appointed by judges and bureaucrats rather than elected&#8212;remain in the draft. So voters, angry at the destruction of the party many support, may reject the proposed charter in the referendum the junta is promising to hold. The mobilisation of police and soldiers ordered by the jumpy generals to head off protests, and their censorship of pro-Thaksin websites and radio stations, may not be enough to prevent rising popular unrest against the regime, despite Mr Thaksin's call on his supporters to accept the verdict. Local newspapers had quoted one of the nine judges as saying they would &#8220;apply the spirit&#8221; of the coup-makers in making their rulings. This, plus the severity of the punishment meted out to Mr Thaksin and his party, and the absolution of the Democrats, will only raise suspicions that the destruction of TRT was a pre-determined outcome.

Tribunal Condemned by Syria, Others - Forbes.com U.N. Tribunal Condemned by Syria, Others 05.31.07, 8:50 AM ET Both Syria and the Lebanese opposition that it supports criticized the United Nations on Thursday for its decision to establish a tribunal to prosecute the killers of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Also Thursday, Lebanon reopened the road where Hariri was killed by a suicide truck bomb in February 2005. Beirut Mayor Abdel-Monem al-Ariss said the spot would remain "a historic symbol in the heart of Beirut." The tribunal has been at the core of a political crisis between the pro-Western government in Beirut and the Hezbollah-led opposition that has erupted into street clashes in recent months, killing 11 people. U.S.-backed Prime Minister Fuad Saniora had asked the council earlier this month to establish the tribunal, citing the refusal of opposition-aligned Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to convene a session to ratify the creation of the tribunal. Berri rejected these accusations Thursday, reflecting the opposition's bitterness over the government's move to take the issue to the U.N. "It is an honor I claim that I don't violate the constitution of my country or indulge in sowing divisions among its sons, and I left for you the opposite 'honor': ignoring (national) reconciliation and the constitution that guides us in Lebanon," Berri said in a brief statement. Syria, which has been implicated in Hariri's assassination by the U.N., was also quick to criticize the establishment of the tribunal under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which deals with threats to international peace and allows military enforcement. Shortly after the vote late Wednesday, Syria's official news agency, citing an unidentified official, said: "The formation of the international court under Chapter 7 is considered as a degradation of Lebanon's sovereignty that might lead to more deterioration of the situations on the Lebanese field." Syrian newspapers on Thursday also criticized the decision as an American-Israeli effort to exact revenge on Damascus, an opponent of both. Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied involvement in the assassination and threatened not to cooperate with the tribunal if it infringes on Syrian national sovereignty. Police cleared roadblocks in front of the 328-yard stretch of road where Hariri and 22 others were killed. The seaside boulevard had been closed for more than two years while the U.N. scoured the ground, adjacent buildings and the nearby Mediterranean Sea for evidence. Among the first to drive through was a passenger minivan, whose driver stopped, got out of the vehicle, knelt and kissed the ground, saying: "God have mercy on your soul." Earlier, Carole Farhat, who survived the bombing two years ago, watched as laborers filled the bomb crater with gravel and paved over it. She said she was glad to be alive "to enjoy this moment." "I've come to see the spot where I was seconds away from death. It might be a good sign for Lebanon and for us," said Farhat, who was thrown in the air by the bombing as she crossed the road. She lost much of her hearing and sustained injuries to her eyes. Daniel Germani, an engineer who was also injured in the bombing, said the reopening of the road would allow his team to repair the famous St. George Hotel, which was severely damaged in the blast. Five hotel employees were killed and eight were wounded, he said. He estimated damages to the hotel at $10 million, saying they had yet to receive compensation. The U.N. resolution gives the Lebanese parliament a last chance to establish the tribunal itself. If it doesn't act by June 10, the U.N. decision will automatically "enter into force." Saad Hariri, leader of the parliamentary majority and the son of the late prime minister, and Saniora have extended a hand to the opposition after the tribunal's approval. But ratification by the parliament so far appears unlikely entangled. Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militant group backed by Iran and Syria, had already warned against establishing the tribunal without parliamentary approval. Saad Hariri said after the vote late Wednesday the decision was a turning point in Lebanon that would protect the country from further assassinations. The vote is a "victory the world has given to oppressed Lebanon and a victory for an oppressed Lebanon in the world," he said, holding back tears at the end of his televised speech. Saniora, a longtime confidant of Rafik Hariri, also called the tribunal "a triumph for Lebanon against injustice, crime and tyranny." He urged the Lebanese to put their differences behind, saying the approval of the tribunal was a "positive step" for renewed dialogue to work together. Copyright 2007 Associated Press.

VOA's Nancy-Amelia Collins in Jakarta has more. Muslims celebrate verdict that denied Lina Joy, a Muslim convert, be recognized as a Christian at entrance of Palace of Justice in Putrajaya, 30 May 2007 Lina Joy lost a six-year battle Wednesday to have the word "Islam" removed from her identity card after the country's top secular court threw the case out. The Federal Court rejected Joy's appeal, saying the country's highest civil court had no jurisdiction in the case that must be dealt with by the Sharia, or Islamic court system. Joy's attorney, Benjamin Dawson, says the reality is that Islamic law does not allow Muslims to formally renounce Islam. If Joy appeared at an Islamic court, she would therefore be admitting to the crime of apostasy. "The real effect of that is that in several states in Malaysia the very act of apostasy is a criminal offense," Dawson said. "In some of these states, you may also be detained for a considerably long period. So it would be quite difficult for those who wish to renounce Islam to go to Sharia court." Joy converted to Christianity in 1990 and was allowed by the National Registration Department to change her name from Azlina Jailani to Lina Joy in 1999. But the entry for her religion remained Islam. The 43-year-old Christian convert wants to be allowed to marry her Christian boyfriend, but is unable to do so as long as her identity card declares her to be a Muslim. While the Malaysian constitution guarantees freedom of religion, Sharia courts claim the right to rule on a range of personal and marital issues. Shad Faruqui, a professor of constitutional law at Malaysia's Mara University of Technology, says Malaysians should have the right to choose their own religion without religious or state interference. "Now personally speaking, in a very objective way, in a global way, international way, people should not have to seek anyone's approval for a matter of conscience," said Faruqui. Joy's attorney says the ruling has harsh consequences for those wishing to renounce Islam. "You have someone who wants to decide the religion of her choice and to live her life according to her choice, but she's now told that decision has to be made by some third party," said Dawson. "I think it's quite difficult for Muslims in particular because that places a restriction on many other issues like for example the right to get married to a non-Muslim - it affects one's life absolutely." Joy's case is one of several recent controversies in which non-Muslim Malaysians believe they are being marginalized by an increasingly confident Islamic legal system.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/11-6&fd=R&url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3%3Fartid%3D14131&cid=1116197449&ei=j_1eRtaKJ4e80QGxx5TNDQ Jewish and Israel News from New York - The Jewish Week Israel Ponders Stronger Counterstrikes Leaders argue for tougher measures to deter Kassam launches amid fears of a new war of attrition. Stewart Ain - Staff Writer The Israeli Air Force continued its targeted strikes this week against Hamas terrorists who are building and firing Kassam rockets at Israel from the Gaza Strip while Hamas leaders reportedly disagreed among themselves whether to continue the attacks and some Israeli leaders argued for a tougher response. On Wednesday, the Air Force reportedly killed two Hamas members when it targeted a group of terrorists who were firing rockets into Israel. That same day, at least one Kassam rocket hit an empty building in Sderot and Hamas leader-in-exile Khaled Meshal was quoted in the British newspaper The Guardian as saying Hamas would continue its attacks, which he called defensive measures against “Zionist aggression.” His comments followed a report that one Hamas leader in Gaza had ordered a halt to all rocket fire. Also on Wednesday, Israel’s security cabinet decided to continue with its present level of response, which includes targeted assassinations against those responsible for or carrying out rocket attacks and limited ground operations in the Gaza Strip. The previous day, two Hamas terrorists were killed by Israeli troops during a cross-border raid into Gaza. Aryeh Mekel, Israel’s consul general in New York, said the Israeli troops who entered Gaza were “special forces who have the capability of going in, doing a job and getting out; they stay just a few hours. They want to punish those who are sending the rockets.” Although there were some in the security cabinet who reportedly argued for tougher measures to put an end to the rocket attacks, Mekel said he believes the current response will continue for some time. “I don’t see a major change,” he said. The security cabinet ministers also rejected Hamas’ call for a cease-fire that would include the West Bank. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is scheduled to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas next week to discuss a cease-fire. Abbas has called upon Hamas to implement an immediate cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and to worry later about extending it to the West Bank. Olmert has reportedly said Israel’s response to the rocket attacks, which by mid-week had killed two Israelis, was effective and that he did not favor an escalation. It was noted that there were only three rocket attacks on Tuesday compared with dozens last week. Despite Hamas’ ability to re-arm by smuggling weapons into Gaza from Egypt, Mekel said the Israeli leadership is against ending it by deploying troops along the Gaza-Egyptian border. “We got out of Gaza not to get back in,” he said, referring to Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Israeli leaders have not ruled out, however, a multi-national force along the border. Gerald Steinberg, a political science professor at Bar-Ilan University, said there has also been talk of establishing permanent military outposts in the Gaza Strip similar to those in the West Bank. “The fact that there are so many suggestions means that there’s no good answer,” he said. “I think we’re in the middle of a war of attrition, where the Israeli goal must be to grind down Hamas enough so that the Palestinians will force a quasi-ceasefire like before. People in Gaza are tired. There’s a significant body of Palestinians who see the use of Gaza as a launching point against Israel as counterproductive.” Ben Fishman, a researcher at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Israeli leaders are also mindful of the “brutal” manner in which Hamas has fought its Palestinian rival, Fatah, in internecine warfare the last several weeks in Gaza. “Israel recognizes this, which is another reason it doesn’t want to get sucked in,” he said, adding that Hamas launched the rocket attacks as a way of uniting Palestinians “at a time when it was largely viewed as provoking internal violence.” But Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Daniel Gillerman, told reporters at an Israel Project luncheon here last week that he viewed Hamas’ rocket attacks as an “act of desperation.” “It comes out of weakness, not strength,” he insisted. “The only reason Hamas entered into the so-called national unity government [with Fatah] was precisely because international pressure [against it] worked. Now is the time for the international community to stand fast and not be lured by the façade of unity. ... Maybe that will bring about a situation where Hamas will collapse.” In the meantime, the impact of the constant rocket attacks on Israel’s southern communities — particularly Sderot — is considerable, according to Shlomo Aronson, a political science professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “About half of the people [in Sderot] have left,” he said. “I do see a very limited war that we can sustain,” Aronson added. “The damage is mainly psychological and it is sustainable. But should a rocket from Gaza land on a kindergarten, God knows what will happen then.” He added that should former Prime Minister Ehud Barak win a June 12 runoff primary for Labor Party leader against former internal security chief Ami Ayalon, Barak would likely become defense minister in Olmert’s government but would be unlikely to change Israel’s military response. Barak captured about 35 percent of the votes — 5 percent more than Ayalon — in this week’s party primary, but failed to secure enough votes to avoid a run-off. The current party leader, Amir Peretz, finished third in the five-man race with 22 percent of the vote. Analysts say Peretz is now in a position to be the kingmaker and can be expected to trade his support for another plum post in Olmert’s government. He is currently the defense minister but has said he would give that up to become finance minister. The Israeli media reported that although Olmert has ruled out appointing Peretz finance minister, he could be expected to create a post that would satisfy Peretz’ desire to have influence in socioeconomic matters. In another development, Shimon Peres, Israel’s vice premier who turns 84 in August, announced Wednesday that he would run for the presidency of Israel for a second time, after having lost in July 2000 to Moshe Katsav. It is a seven-year term. “This may be my last chance to serve the country,” Peres said after his Kadima Party endorsed him for the June 13 race. He said he was acceding to the requests of many, including Olmert, to run for presidency, a position that is selected by the 120-member Knesset in a secret ballot. Peres served as prime minister on three occasions during his 60-year political career but was never elected. Peres, the architect behind the 1993 Oslo Accords with the Palestinians for which he shared the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize, is challenging Colette Avital of the Labor Party and Reuven Rivlin of the Likud Party in the race for president.

Place a classified newspaper ad Australia 'can't stop whaling' May 31, 2007 12:00 Australia alone cannot stop Japan slaughtering whales, the federal government says. Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull said diplomacy was the only way to encourage Japan to end its "scientific whaling" program. "There's nothing we can do unilaterally," Mr Turnbull told the Nine Network. "This is a problem that has to be dealt with diplomatically and politically in discussions between nations, between Japan and all the other nations around the world." Mr Turnbull ruled out legal action in the international courts as an avenue to stop Japan, saying it would be ineffective. "I've discussed that with our own lawyers, I've discussed that with the representatives of a number of other countries including the US, UK, New Zealand, Brazil and others," he said. "Everybody agrees that to bring that sort of litigation would be very unwise because we would almost certainly lose. "And of course Japan's victory in that litigation, no matter how technical, would be regarded by Japan as vindication for their actions, so that would be really counterproductive." Mr Turnbull was speaking from the International Whaling Commission in Anchorage, Alaska, where overnight Japan said the IWC should allow four of its coastal communities to hunt minke whales because the tradition is so old that it qualifies as subsistence hunting. Japan's proposal came a day after the body allowed Alaska natives to continue the subsistence hunts of bowhead whales through 2012. Joji Morishita, the alternate IWC commissioner for Japan, told delegates that the Japanese communities "have been living on this tradition for hundreds of years; it is part of their lives." Morishita said science cannot draw the line between small coastal whaling and aboriginal whaling. Japan already kills about a 1,000 whales a year and sells the meat under a scientific research provision allowed by the whaling commission, which enacted a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. Morishita acknowledged that if Japan's request is approved, some meat from the minke whales, a relatively small species, would be sold. "What's wrong with commerciality?" he said. "Even the media here is commercial. Why do people have to see only commercial whaling as evil?" Mr Turnbull said most countries opposed Japan's whaling. "The obstacle we face is that Japan to date has not been prepared to change its policy," he said. "It has tried to reinstate commercial whaling and it has been defeated, so we have stopped it increasing the whaling activities but it does use this loophole of so-called scientific whaling. "The fundamental point is there is simply no scientific basis for assuming there can be sustainable harvesting of whales." Mr Turnbull said resuming commercial whaling would "dreadfully" set back the world's whale populations. "The only reason we're starting to see humpbacks again around Australia's coast is because of the 20-plus-year ban on commercial whaling which has meant the populations have started to recover," he said. Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull says Australia alone can't end Japan's whale hunt and diplomacy is the only way. See what Australians are doing to protect whales and check our gallery .

They might just be doing all of humanity a favour. If the oceans are going to rise because of global warming then maybe by getting rid of the whales who would be taking up a hell of a lot of water then this might just counterbalance the rising sea levels. Neil Harvey of Sour Grape Heights start sinking their boats and plead insanity and then keep doing it again and again. that is my solution. that might scare them off. we have to protect them whales. japan why don&#39;t you find another fish to eat like the blow-fish. whale lover of Bondi Yes, shame on you Japan. Not only are you doing the whale population a great injustice, but you look incredibly stupid to the rest of the world. Having previously worked for a Japanese company and seeing how peaceful these people seemed, I now view that part of the world as a cruel, greedy, ridiculous and evil place. If what you are doing wasn&#39;t so hideous and serious, we would all laugh at you. Wake up and smell the roses and see that this will inevitably affect the way the world views your country and your people and may even affect your economy. How can you possibly compare what you do to Aboriginal hunting? Australia&#39;s indigenous people have used their hunting methods for thousands and thousands of years as a means of survival. They do not take huge boats out into the ocean and hunt gentle mammals only to bring the catch back to Australian restaurants for us to eat. "Scientific research"? Who do you think you&#39;re kidding? I implore all Australians to boycott Japan and all of its exports/products until the murder ceases! I am very disapppointed that the Japanese have gotten away with this. They only seem to take themselves into consideration. Why don&#39;t they have the samurai tradition of beheading if that was so taken seriously and sternly? Jedi Vo of Fully Bankstown What a joke, killing whales for &#39;scientific whaling&#39;! You can&#39;t tell me that they need to kill thousands of whales for scientific purposes? Whats the purpose what&#39;s their findings have they ever told us? Stephanie of Milsons Pt "What&#39;s wrong with commerciality?" he said. "Even the media here is commercial. Why do people have to see only commercial whaling as evil?" -- Gee because commercial whaling kills whereas the media doesn&#39;t.How small is that brain of yours? This pathetic Japanese twit even tried to compare our beef industry with commercial whaling. The difference is we do it humanely and the cows are not endangered. Japan however slaughter whales in cold blood. If someone can show the interiors of their ships that harpoon these whales, then we might see what kind of research is really going on inside. Steve T of Sydney Damn Japanese whaling and Norway and Iceland who somehow seem to escape any attention for their part in the killing of whales Unless the World unites this it will continue.Japan is much more powerful than Australia and they will do as they like. Reality is we have too much trade with Japan to do much about this slaughter. So typical of this arrogant nation in regards to plundering the sea! There is no end to their greed for the world&#39;s resources, and the poor innocent and majestic Humpbacks are next for their dog food and deep freezers. It appears that they no longer have an appetitie for &#39;saving face&#39; and will defy the rest of the world&#39;s wishes as usual. Shame, Japan, shame, you look greedy, cruel and stupid! Nippon Pirate of Sydney EVERYONE SHOULD READ: I can&#39;t believe these animals can still hunt whales. It is not for scientific research that is a lie and now not only do we have to suffer at the hands of MEN with Global Warming now we are going to have every animal wiped off the face of the earth because these feral people eat everything with a heart beat.

Mark McGowan, 37, said he ate "about three bites" of the dog meat, cooked with apples, onions and seasoning, to highlight what he called Prince Philip's mistreatment of a fox during a hunt in January. "It was pretty disgusting," McGowan said of the meal, which he ate while appearing on a London radio station on Tuesday. Yoko Ono, another guest on the show, also tried the meat. "I've never tasted anything like it -- it was grey and had a very funny smell. It was horrible," McGowan told Reuters. McGowan said he was angry that the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, of which the royal family is a patron, had not prosecuted Prince Philip for hunting and killing the fox. The RSPCA said the fox did not suffer. Corgis are the favoured dogs of the Queen, who has owned more than 30 of them during her reign. The dog died of natural causes at a Corgi breeders and was prepared and cooked by others for McGowan. McGowan is well known for his outlandish performance stunts. He ate a swan in another protest against the Queen. Swans are protected by the monarchy. &copy; Reuters 2007.

Vladimir Putin on Thursday criticised "diktat and imperialism" in global affairs and warned that Russia would strengthen its military potential to maintain a global strategic balance. "It wasn't us who initiated a new round of arms race," Putin said when asked about the missile tests at a news conference after talks with his Greek counterpart. Russia tested a new ballistic missile capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads and a new cruise missile on Tuesday. "There is no reason to fear these actions by Russia, they aren't aggressive. It's merely a response to tough and unfounded unilateral actions by our partners," Putin said. "These actions are aimed at preserving a global balance." He also attacked the US and other Nato members for failing to ratify an amended version of the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, which limits the deployment of heavy non-nuclear weapons around the continent. Putin said: "We have signed and ratified the CFE and are fully implementing it. We have pulled out all our heavy weapons from the European part of Russia to [locations] behind the Ural Mountains and cut our military by 300,000 men. "There is no reason to fear these actions by Russia, they aren't aggressive. It's merely a response to tough and unfounded unilateral actions by our partners" "And what about our partners? They are filling Eastern Europe with new weapons. A new base in Bulgaria, another one in Romania, a [missile defence] site in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic. "What are we supposed to do? We can't just sit back and look at that." Putin's comments came a week before he meets George Bush, the US president, and other leaders of the Group of Eight (G8) industrialised nations at a summit in Germany. The White House dismissed Putin's thinly veiled attacked on US policies. Gordon Johndroe, US national security council spokesman, said: "While we have some differences, they are nothing other than issues that can be worked out through the continued dialogue we have face to face. "The United States and Russia co-operate on a range of issues from counter-terrorism to global energy solutions." Moscow has repeatedly rejected US assurances that the planned missile defence installations in Poland and the Czech Republic are meant to counter a potential threat from nations such as Iran and pose no danger to Russia.

Former presidential candidate Manuel Rosales said protests over the government's move to halt the broadcasts of Radio Caracas Television show that "freedom cannot be negotiated nor bargained."

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano) (Fernando Llano - AP) The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article Protesters have filled the capital's plazas and streets since the opposition-aligned channel went off the air at midnight Sunday. Chavez refused to renew its broadcast license, and police have clashed with angry crowds hurling rocks and bottles. A total of 182 people _ mostly university students and minors _ have been detained in nearly 100 protests since Sunday, Justice Minister Pedro Carreno said late Tuesday. At least 30 were charged with violent acts, prosecutors said, but it was unclear how many remained behind bars. "Freedom for those young men and women, immediately. They should not be treated like criminals," said Rosales, the governor of western Zulia state who was handily defeated by Chavez in December elections. "I know that Radio Caracas will return to the air," Rosales said. He said protesters are demanding not only free speech but also the right to protest "peacefully and democratically." As he spoke, roughly 8,000 student protesters chanting "freedom!" marched toward the offices of the People's Defender, a government official in charge of monitoring human rights. Marchers stopped at a police barricade, while several leaders delivered a protest letter to authorities at the office. "The students are taking a stand, but not to oust the government or cause chaos as some allege," student leader John Goicochea said. Although the march was generally peaceful, there were several small scuffles between students and "Chavistas" who approached the demonstrators, jeering and shouting insults. Some office workers in the business district tossed confetti out of their windows in support. Chavez accused RCTV of helping incite a failed coup in 2002, violating broadcast laws and "poisoning" Venezuelans with soap operas and game shows that promoted capitalism. He said his decision to replace it Monday with a new state-funded public channel, TVES, is a step toward "democratizing" the airwaves. Thousands of Chavez supporters marched Tuesday, saying they reject an opposition attempt to stir up a "guarimba" _ a term for protesters' makeshift barriers of trash and debris that refers to creating unrest aimed at overthrowing the government.

EJIOFOR ALIKE with agency report Angry villagers had for the second time this month attacked a major export pipeline in the country and disrupted 150,000 barrels per day of oil production. Community members stormed the Bomu pipeline complex feeding the Bonny crude export terminal in Rivers State, prompting the partial shutdown of the Trans-Niger pipeline earlier on Tuesday. "We are ramping up production," a company spokeswoman said yesterday. Youths from the K-Dere community started to spill crude oil by opening some pressure indicator valves. Consequently, the company had to shut in some of the oil production. Global crude oil futures were trading higher above $68 yesterday following an early rally on reports of the attack. However, it later slipped below $68 the same day, the fourth straight day of losses due to increased gasoline output by the US. Shell said it had already begun to restore some of the lost production, but would not specify how much. The same protesters, from the Ogoni area of River Stat, had attacked the same pipeline hub on May 10 and occupied it for six days, forcing a 170,000-barrel-a-day closure. "It&#8217;s the same group of boys who occupied the facility last time. They say Shell has broken the agreement it had with them and that&#8217;s why they decided to occupy it again," said Blessing Kolzor, a community leader in K-Dere. The protesters want a stake in the oil flowing through Ogoni, an area where Shell suspended production 14 years ago because of popular protests. There is no production in Ogoni, but the area is still criss-crossed by oil pipelines. Shell had only just resumed normal production levels at its 400,000 bpd Bonny terminal before Tuesday&#8217;s attack. Exports remained under a force majeure, a legal measure exempting Shell from its contractual export obligations. The latest disruption brings to 845,000 bpd, or one-third of capacity, the volume of oil production shut by a wave of unrest in the Niger Delta. President Umaru Yar&#8217;Adua, who took office Tuesday, said he would urgently address the crisis in the oil-producing region. The militants have promised to release six hostages yesterday as a sign of their readiness to talk. However, about 25 foreigners are currently being held captive. Four former governors on the...

Protests by youths had partially shut production from the field, according to a Shell spokeswoman in London. "It has been reopened and we are bringing back production," Precious Okolobo, Shell's spokesman in Lagos told Dow Jones Newswires. He said the protesters had closed the Bomu Manifold, a key pipeline hub. Corrected May 30, 2007 07:10 ET (11:10 GMT) The Bonny Light field normally produces around 400,000 barrels of crude oil a day, according to traders. Shell owns 30% of the SPDC joint venture, which operates the site where the attack took place. The state-run National Nigerian Petroleum Corp. owns 55% and units of Total SA (TOT) and Eni SpA (E) hold 10% and 5%, respectively. (Angela Henshall and David Elliott in London contributed to this story.) "It has been reopened and we are bringing back production," Precious Okolobo, Shell's spokesman in Lagos told Dow Jones Newswires.

Photograph: Marcus Yam/AP The highest court in Malaysia today rejected a Muslim convert's appeal to be recognised as a Christian, ending a six-year legal battle that will heighten the country's religious minorities' concerns over discrimination. Lina Joy, 42, had fought the decisions of Malaysia's lower courts in an effort to have the word "Islam" removed from her identity card, arguing that the country's constitution guarantees her religious freedom. But in a landmark ruling the three judge panel decided in a majority verdict that it had no power to intervene in apostasy cases, which fall under the jurisdiction of Malaysia's Sharia courts. The woman, who gave up her job and went into hiding last year after being shunned by family and friends, was not in court. Earlier her lawyer said she realised her chances of victory were slim but believed she had to battle on to win the right to a normal life. Two hundred Muslim protesters who gathered in a prayer vigil outside the federal court buildings today greeted the verdict with cries of "Allah-u-Akbar" (God is great). The court's decision comes as tensions grow between the Muslim Malay majority and the ethnic Chinese and Indian minorities who are mainly Hindu, Buddhist or Christian. Islam is the official religion in a country where 60% of the 27 million population are ethnic Malay. The constitution guarantees freedom of worship, but Malays must be Muslim by law. Malaysia's civil courts run in tandem with the Sharia courts, which rule on family issues such as divorce, child custody and inheritance for Muslims. However, it has never been made clear which branch of the court takes precedence. Ms Joy - born Azlina Jailani - started attending church in 1990 and was baptised eight years later. She was given permission to change her name, but "Islam" remained on her identity card under her religion. In 2000 Ms Joy, who has an ethnic Indian Catholic boyfriend, applied to the high court to have her religion changed but was referred to the Sharia court. She challenged the decision in the appeal court and finally took the matter to the apex federal court. "She cannot simply at her own whim enter or leave her religion," Judge Ahmad Fairuz said during today's ruling. "She must follow rules." But Judge Richard Malanjum, the only non-Muslim on the panel, sided with Ms Joy, saying it was "unreasonable" to ask her to turn to the Sharia court as she could face criminal prosecution because abandoning Islam is punishable by a fine or jail. Critics of the verdict expressed dismay and said it failed to uphold the legal rights of Malaysians. "People like Lina Joy shouldn't be trapped in a legal cage, not being able to come out to practice their true conscience and religion," said Leonard Teoh, a Malaysian Catholic lawyer.

Yaþar Büyükanýt said a military operation in northern Iraq is necessary and they wait for a relevant decision to be made by political mechanism. While the heaviest military build-up of recent years goes on in the Iraq border in eastern Turkey, preparations for a possible operation were launched. The retired general at a key post to provide cooperation and communication between Turkey and the U.S. regarding the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party's (PKK) terror, removed from office by the government. Last week's suicide bombing in Ankara and confessions of terrorists caught in numerous cities in this process strengthened the conviction that the PKK targets big cities. The violation of Turkish airspace last week by two U.S. F 16s created the impression that the government and armed forces are at odds. And finally, Kurdish administrators in northern Iraq made statements in the meaning “Turkish tanks cannot find way to these lands.” Operation by press releases?: Undoubtedly the key issue needs to be clarified here is the situation that produces reservations about politics-military relations and confuses the minds. By all means, neither from the military nor the politics perspective sharing thoughts about an imaginary military operation through press releases is normal. It is even needless to say that this is against the traditions of Turkish Army and the general principles of military professional. And only to know this requires a deduction that something is odd, there is something unusual. If you ask, what is “unusual”, my answer would be: The U.S. factor&#8230; Let me elaborate this a bit more: In the good old days, “Army to Iraq” meant a “hot pursue” or a “cross border operation”. And in legal perspective, all military operations before the U.S. invasion in Iraq were held by the approval of Baghdad and in the frame of mutual agreement with the neighboring country. But now, the situation has changed. Neither the approval of Baghdad nor of Washington is the point at issue. To the opposite, statements made by both capitals give the impression of an objection and even an implicit/explicit threat against Turkey. Therefore regardless of the decision by political body in Ankara depends on the ground of “terror” it will blatantly have the characteristic of a “declaration of war”. Intervention at all odds?: Let me get to the point. I am of the opinion that the public impression of a communication break down between the military and the politics stems from that the Turkish army will be facing the U.S. forces in northern Iraq. Because the presence of Kurdish peshmerga in northern Iraq does not justify who the dominant power is in the region. Therefore it is reasonable to explain the limped communication between the Turkish Armed Forces and the government by the desire to reach a prompt conclusion in the diplomatic initiatives with Washington. Observation of escalating desire “intervention at all odds” in the Turkish army might strengthen the hands of foreign affairs having hard time to express itself in Washington. But if you ask the question whether the army will enter Iraq, the answer of course will be it is possible if suicide bombings similar to the one in Ankara continue. Apparently as long as the investigation about the suicide attack of Anafartalar Avenue in Ankara is in progress, opportunities will rise to make some new assessments beyond clarifying the incident as an attack by the PKK. I previously mentioned that there are some groups in Washington making calculations to provoke Turkish military and dragging it into the quagmire in Iraq. And the military will be worn out in a “nightmare period”, civilian decision making mechanism will be strengthened etc&#8230; I hope we will not end up loses because of the incertitude originates from election and politics discussions.

The International Whaling Commission (IWC) on Tuesday agreed to renew quotas for whale hunts by natives in the US and Russia, but deferred Greenland's bid for a quota expansion. A unanimous decision endorsing the five-year quota extensions for the Alaskan natives in the US and the indigenous Chukotka people in Russia as well as natives in the St Vincent and the Grenadines was made at the IWC annual talks in Anchorage, Alaska. The 75-nation commission manages whaling and is in charge of conservation of the large creatures. Even though it imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986, it has a policy of allowing so-called subsistence hunts for natives in the four nations to satisfy longstanding cultural and subsistence needs. Officials said Greenland's bid was put on hold as it sought a quota increase from 175 to 200 minke whales and its fin whale hunt from a voluntary cap of 10 to 19 per year. The semi-autonomous Danish territory also wanted to add 10 humpbacks per year and two bowhead whales, neither of which have been hunted in Greenland for decades. IWC chief William Hogarth urged Denmark to review its proposal in a spirit of "compromise" and return to the meeting for further discussions. Amalie Jessen, Denmark's alternate commissioner to the IWC, said: "We will negotiate," but declined to provide any possible new quota numbers. The US heaved a sigh of relief with its renewal of the bowhead whale hunting quotas for the Inupia and Yup'ik peoples of Alaska after intensively lobbying among IWC members. Hogarth, who is also the US chief representative at the commission, thanked IWC members states for the unanimous decision and called on them to maintain the spirit of consensus. The US quota has been used in the past as a bargaining tool by Japan to try to gain approval for its community-whaling quotas. There were speculations Japan had tried to win US support for its plan for Japanese traditional coastal communities to catch whales under the same rules allowing aboriginal peoples to hunt whales. A large number of pro-whaling countries vote with Japan at the IWC and green groups had warned the US not to cave in to pressure. The scientific basis for the US proposal is good and "it is sustainable hunt and we support sustainable whaling," Japanese alternative commissioner to the IWC, Joji Morishita, said as he backed the US request.

On Wednesday the Constitutional Court imposed a similar ban on 110 other members of his Thai Rak Thai party, and ordered the party itself to be dissolved. The verdicts come after the court found Thaksin's party guilty of electoral fraud. Supporters of the ousted former leader, including some of the banned party executives, planned a protest on Thursday over the court decision which stunned the country. Thai Rak Thai's rivals, the Democrat Party, were cleared of similar charges and escaped a threatened dissolution. Speaking after the verdict Thaksin, who now resides in London, asked his supporters to remain calm and respect the court's ruling. "We have to respect the rules of the game. That is, the rule of the law" Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted Thai prime minister He urged them to accept the disbanding of his party and the five-year political ban on its top leadership. "As party leader, I humbly accept the ruling and I want to urge the [Council for National Security] and government to hold general elections as soon as possible," Thaksin said in a statement read out by his lawyer in Before the ruling Thaksin told supporters to "respect the rules of the game" and "the rule of the law". The government meanwhile has announced a nationwide security clampdown for an indefinite period, placing thousands of soldiers on alert and beefing up deployments at police checkpoints. Sonthi Boonyaratglin, the general who led last September's coup, said the situation was "totally under control" and authorities were monitoring Thaksin associates and "hardcore" loyalists for possible trouble. "Security measures have been stepped up since last night and will gradually be increased," Sonthi told AFP. "The measures will be in place for a long time." The military-backed government has promised to hold elections at the end of the year after a new constitution is promulgated. Surayad Chulanont, the military-installed prime minister, has reiterated an earlier warning that he would impose a state of emergency to quell any unrest. The ruling, which cannot be appealed, held Thai Rak Thai had used "parliamentary elections only as a means to achieve totalitarian power" and disregarded the rule of law. The court's decision drew a mixed reaction, with some analysts saying it was likely to "deepen confrontation" between the military-led government and the masses. "Thai Rak Thai commanded a large rural electorate and if they don't win them over and fill that political vacuum, there will be trouble," said Thitinan Pongsidhirak, a political scientist at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. "The resistance might be quiet but it will also be deep-seated and strong," he added. But other analysts said Thai politics was entering uncharted waters, and the ensuing uncertainty could be used by any party to gain power. "A lot could happen at this point... the process of bargaining may change and things may be quite different from what people expect," said Chris Baker, a veteran analyst and author on the country's politics. He said it was difficult to predict too far into the future of Thai politics. "There is not a lot for any party to gain from violence at this point," he added. "If anything, it will strengthen the grip of the military."

North Korea agreed at international nuclear talks in February to shut down its atomic reactor by mid-April, but has refused to act on its pledge until it receives funds from a Macau bank that were frozen after the U.S. blacklisted the financial organization in 2005. "From the beginning, our position has been consistent" that the North will close the Yongbyon reactor only after receiving the US$25 million (euro18.6 million) being held in Banco Delta Asia, Kim Myong Gil, a minister at North Korea&#039;s mission to the U.N. in New York, told The Associated Press by telephone. "There is no other way." The North has made the resolution of the banking row an absolute precondition for nuclear disarmament. The money has since been freed, but the transfer has been held up because other banks are apparently hesitant to touch the funds, which the U.S. alleges were tied to Pyongyang&#039;s money laundering and counterfeiting. Today in Asia - Pacific Thailand facing uncertainty after court ruling An escapee tells of life and death in North Korea&#x27;s labor camps U.S. and India closer to nuclear agreement In Beijing, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill urged the hardline communist country to start shutting down their nuclear reactor even before receiving its funds. "Rather than standing around waiting for us to do things, they should get going on their own obligations," Hill said after meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wu Dawei. "There is no purpose in that reactor operating today." U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the nuclear deal is just the beginning of a long march toward the denuclearization of the divided Korean peninsula. "The Feb. 13th agreement, when implemented, will be a good start to a longer process of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," Rice said at a news conference in Vienna Thursday. North Korea boycotted international nuclear talks for more than a year over the release of the funds, during which it conducted its first-ever nuclear test in October. The nuclear talks involve the U.S., the two Koreas, China, Japan and Russia. Associated Press Writer Veronika Oleksyn in Vienna contributed to this report.

Hundreds of students marched for 182 minutes in Caracas Wednesday to demand the release of 182 people arrested earlier this week while protesting RCTV's closure. A letter was delivered to the city ombudsman's office "telling him we have 182 students under arrest simply because they want democracy, freedom of speech," student leader John Goicochea told reporters. He said the ombudsman had told the students that a few detainees would be set free later on Wednesday. The Attorney General's office, in turn, told AFP it was seeking to prosecute some 45 detainees, including several minors. Thousands of people have taken to the streets since Friday to protest Chavez's refusal on Sunday to renew RCTV's license on grounds it was conspiring against him and had supported a brief, failed coup in 2003. On Monday several people were injured in Caracas as police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at demonstrators. The government later said 182 people, including 107 minors, were detained across the country during disturbances on Monday and Tuesday, and that 19 policemen were injured. Chavez on Tuesday said the student demonstrators were being manipulated by people seeking to destabilise Venezuela, and called on Venezuelans to defend the country from "a new fascist attack." In response, Central University of Venezuela student Carlos Julio Rojas told AFP that Wednesday's protest march was also meant to disprove Chavez's accusation. "We want to show that we're not being manipulated by any political group," he said. "All we want is freedom." Andres Bello Catholic University (UCAB) student union leader David Smolansky called for a more demonstrations around the country on Friday, urging all Venezuelans to join in the anti-Chavez protests. "We call on civil society to join us in expressing our discontent," he told AFP. Chavez on Wednesday called for a massive demonstration on Saturday "to counter the provocations of the counter revolutionaries," according to a statement on a government-run website. Most of the demonstrators around the country were university students, in what observers noted was a resurgence of student protest movements of the kind last seen in 1989. "For a long time, there was a lack of motivation, but now there is hope (the student protest) will have an impact at the national level, around the whole country," UCAB faculty board member Francisco Vargas told AFP. The United States on Wednesday renewed its concern over RCTV's shutdown and the erosion of human rights it signals in Venezuela. "We are obviously concerned... about any actions that would be taken that would limit freedom of expression, that would limit the rights of people to gain information from a variety of sources," said State Department spokesperson Tom Casey. Top Democratic US lawmaker Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, issued a statement calling on Chavez to "reconsider this ill-advised decision." "President Chavez should know that efforts to suppress the media will not only ultimately fail, but are also a detriment to one of the pillars of democracy: freedom of expression," Pelosi said. RCTV has been broadcasting for 53 years and until its shutdown midnight Sunday was Venezuela's most popular network.

Elsewhere, a suicide bomber hit a police recruiting center in Fallujah, killing as many as 25 people, police said. The U.S. military said only one policeman was killed and eight were wounded. The American military also reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed Wednesday in a roadside bombing in Baghdad and one who died of wounds from a roadside bomb attack northwest of the capital Tuesday. At least 122 American forces have died in May, the third-deadliest month of the Iraq conflict. U.S. forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al-Qaida gunmen in western Baghdad's primarily Sunni Muslim Amariyah neighborhood in an engagement that lasted several hours, said the district councilman, who would not allow use of his name for fear of al-Qaida retribution. Casualty figures were not immediately available and there was not immediate word from the U.S. military on the engagement. But the councilman said the al-Qaida leader in the Amariyah district, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters were detained. Members of al-Qaida, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final exams, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, the councilman said. U.S. forces also continued a search for five Britons who were kidnapped Tuesday in Baghdad, as well as for two of its soldiers who have been missing since a May 12 ambush south of the capital. The Fallujah suicide bomber killed at least 10 policemen in the attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. The rest of the dead were civilians, many of them in line seeking jobs as policemen. He said as many as 50 were wounded. Fallujah General Hospital had received 15 bodies and 10 wounded, according to a doctor there, who would not allow the use of his name because he feared retribution. The physician said he believed other casualties were taken to the nearby Jordanian Hospital and private clinics. A member of the Fallujah city council, who also asked for anonymity for fear of attack by insurgents, said there were at least 20 killed and 25 injured. The coordination of information in Fallujah was particularly difficult because the mobile telephone system has been working only sporadically. Maj. Jeff Pool of the Multi-National Force-West said the Anbar province governor's office and the provincial police put the total number of dead at one Iraqi policeman, with six police and two civilians wounded in Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated explosives in his vest at the third of four checkpoints, standing among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only opened Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The U.S. military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaida. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of Sunni insurgents and al-Qaida throughout the war. U.S. forces, meanwhile, pressed on with the search for five kidnapped Britons, and a procession of mourners, some of them women wailing and beating their chests, marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a U.S. helicopter strike before dawn. The U.S. military said it had no report of airstrikes in Sadr City and that there were no civilian casualties in the second day of a search for the Britons, who were abducted Tuesday from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad. A U.S. military statement, however, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. AP Television News videotape from Sadr City showed the coffins of the victims atop a small bus with men and women walking behind, crying. A young boy could be seen sitting next to the coffins. A car in the area was punctured with big holes, as if hit by an airstrike. A police officer in Sadr City, who refused to allow use of his name because he feared retribution, said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 a.m., killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home &mdash; a common practice in Iraq's extreme heat through late spring and summer. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was wounded. Also in Sadr City raids, which the U.S. has been conducting with a select unit of Iraqi army forces, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi claimed his home was raided and ransacked by American forces at 3 a.m. Thursday. The military said it had no report of the incident. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. Dozens of U.S. Humvees and Bradley fighting vehicles had taken up positions around Sadr City at nightfall Wednesday. The five kidnapped Britons included four bodyguards working for the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld and one employee of BearingPoint, a U.S.-based management consulting firm. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. The Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, claimed responsibility. Wiggins also said that more than 100 patrols a day were being launched to search for two missing troops who vanished after a May 12 ambush near Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. Four Americans and one Iraqi soldier were killed in the attack and the body of another American was later found in the Euphrates River. "Our determination and resolve to locate our missing soldiers is unwavering," Wiggins said.

Immigration Minister Ze'ev Boim announces intention to propose counter-boycott An American research foundation announced on Thursday that following the decision of the British University and College Union (UCU) to consider launching an academic boycott of Israel it has cancelled its plans to open a grant application process for UK researchers. &#39;Israel being ostracized&#39; / British-Jewish academic, speaking before boycott vote, says &#39;there&#39;s something in the air in the UK, boycott will lead to anti-Semitism&#39; The &#036;150 million Goldhirsh foundation supports scientists around the world in the quest for a cure for brain cancer funds research. In a letter to British academic institutions, foundation leader Elizabeth Goldhirsh writes: " As a director of a &#036;150 million foundation that supports scientists around the world in the quest for a cure for brain cancer, I am profoundly disappointed in your union's decision to boycott Israel today. "This action represents a severe setback for academic freedom and open discourse. Moreover, the decision to single out and demonize Israel above and beyond all other countries - remaining silent over Russia's brutal occupation in Chechnya, for example, or China's ongoing oppression of Tibet - is, at best, troubling. At worst, it points to a far more sinister and tragic motivation. "Equally disturbing is to do so at a time when Israel's civilians are facing near-daily missile attacks from Gaza and her partner for negotiations is an organization that dispatches suicide bombers and refuses to recognize the Jewish State's right to exist. "Given this decision, I am deeply saddened to say that while my foundation had been considering opening up our scientific grant process to British researchers we will no longer be able to do so. I urge you to work against this boycott and restore learning's highest ideal of fairness free of prejudice to British academia." 'Freezing Jewish donations to UK institutions' Meanwhile Immigrant Absorption Minister Ze'ev Boim has suggested that Jewish donors supporting academic institutions in the United Kingdom freeze their donations following the boycott proposal. Boim, who is currently in London, said he plans to discuss the issue with leaders of the Jewish community in Britain and with Israeli representatives who have held talks on the issue with British higher education officials. "The UCU's decision is extremely serious. It compels the Israeli government to reconsider its actions. Likewise world Jewry must also consider its steps against this futile boycott. I intend to propose a counter-boycott against British acadmic institutions during the cabinet meeting on Sunday," said Boim. Bill Rammell, Britain's higher education minister, said he was disappointed the union had passed a motion ''which encourages its members to consider boycotting Israeli academics.'' ''I profoundly believe this does nothing to promote the Middle East peace process,'' he said. It was further reported on Thursday that UNISON, the biggest trade union in Britain, is considering renewing its economic boycott of Israel as an act of protest against last summerâ€™s Second Lebanon War and the IDF strikes in Gaza. In 2002 the organization, which represents some 1.6 million workers, prohibited the purchase of Israeli goods and investments in the Jewish state. The sanctions were lifted following Israelâ€™s disengagement from the Gaza Strip in the summer of 2005.

Mark McGowan, who has previously eaten a swan as part of a performance art show, tucked into the dog alongside the widow of ex-Beatle John Lennon, live on a London radio station. "I know some people will find this offensive and tasteless but I am doing this to raise awareness about the RSPCA&#39;s inability to prosecute Prince Philip and his friends shooting a fox earlier this year, letting it struggle for life for five minutes and then beating it to death with a stick," he said. The RSPCA (the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) is in charge of handing over evidence to British prosecutors in cases where they believe acts of cruelty to animals have been committed. They said they found "no evidence" that any offence had taken place in January, when the incident took place. "An independent post-mortem examination was carried out and found that the fox died from gunshot wounds - and no evidence of other injury or trauma was found," it said in a statement. "The only witness who could have supported the version of events reported in some sections of the media refused to give a statement." McGowan said the dog, which died at a breeding farm, tasted "really, really disgusting," and added that Ono "looked a bit strange" as she also tasted the dog. The queen has owned more than 30 corgis during her reign, which started in 1952, and currently owns four.

The Taliban has claimed responsibility. Initial reports suggested the helicopter was hit with a rocket-propelled grenade, a US military official said today. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said seven ISAF soldiers were killed after the CH-47 Chinook went down in Helmand province near Kajaki, the site of a major hydroelectric damn and scene of fierce battles in recent months. The crew of five and two military passengers died, NATO said. It did not release nationalities, but a US official said the two passengers were not American. There were no survivors. A battalion of US forces from the 82nd Airborne Division, fighting under the ISAF flag, has been engaged in heavy fighting in recent weeks in Helmand - the world's largest poppy-growing region. More Taliban militants have massed in Helmand than in any other province. A purported Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, claimed in a phone call to The Associated Press that militants had shot the helicopter down near Kajaki. He did not offer any proof of the claim, but Ahmadi did specify that the helicopter went down in Kajaki hours before NATO released that information. "We have weapons that we have used to target helicopters before," he said. ISAF said troops responding to the crash site were ambushed by enemy fighters and that the unit called in an airstrike "to eliminate the enemy threat." It did not specify if the troops were from the U.S.-led coalition, ISAF or Afghan forces. One Afghan civilian was injured by gunfire during the firefight, ISAF said. The cause of the crash was "being determined by military officials," it said. The CH-47 Chinook, a heavy transport helicopter with twin rotors, can carry up to around 40 troops plus a small crew. The fact it was flying at night suggests the helicopter may have been carrying troops on a nighttime air assault. Kajaki is the site of a large US-funded hydroelectric dam now being repaired so it can provide electricity to the southern city of Kandahar. British troops, who make up the bulk of the forces in Helmand province, have been engaged in fierce fighting around the dam to protect it. Helicopter crashes in Afghanistan have been relatively rare. A Chinook crashed in February in the southern province of Zabul, killing eight US servicemembers. Officials ruled out enemy fire as the cause. In May 2006, another Chinook crashed attempting a nighttime landing on a small mountaintop in eastern Kunar province, killing 10 US soldiers. In 2005, a US helicopter crashed in Kunar, after apparently being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, killing 16 American troops. Elsewhere, a senior military officer said the US has "got the Taliban on their heels" in Afghanistan. Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Pentagon reporters that "as a result of a number of operations ... basically the Taliban has suffered numerous losses and has suffered losses to their senior leadership over this past month" in southern and eastern Afghanistan. As a result, he said, the Taliban has "reverted to asymmetric-type, small-scale, high-profile attacks." Mullah Dadullah, a one-legged veteran who orchestrated an intensifying campaign of suicide attacks and beheadings, was killed in an operation in southern Afghanistan this month. He had been considered the top Taliban field commander. Still, Brig. Gen. Wiggins noted that as the poppy harvest ends, more insurgents may join the battle. "So the fight's not over," he said. "but we'll continue to take the offensive through several of the operations we have in Afghanistan, and hopefully ... continue to inflict casualties on the Taliban."

The threat came as thousands of students shut down roads and protested against the closure of Radio Caracas television (RCTV). More than a dozen were reported injured in clashes with police. In a speech transmitted by several radio and television stations, the left-wing populist Chavez noted that his Information Minister Willian Lara asked the Attorney General&#8217;s Office to investigate a Globovision programme. The show aired footage of the assassination attempt against the late pope John Paul II, to a song by Panamanian salsa singer Ruben Blades who sang, &#8220;have faith, this does not end here.&#8221; &#8220;I alert the Venezuelan people - the enemies of the homeland, particularly those who are behind the scenes &#8230; I call you by your name, Globovision. You decide how far you want to get, I advise you to look well at how far you are going to get,&#8221; Chavez said. &#8220;If you want, keep moving forward, if you want, keep calling for disobedience, inciting to murder,&#8221; he added. Chavez charged that the programme under investigation wanted to encourage the murder of the Venezuelan president and did so &#8220;openly.&#8221; Venezuela&#8217;s oldest and most popular television station, Radio Caracas Television (RCTV), was shut down overnight Monday and replaced by a new, government-controlled channel, Televisora Venezolana Social (Teves). Chavez justified his government&#8217;s decision not to renew RCTV&#8217;s licence, saying that the popular TV station had supported the short- lived coup that briefly removed him from power in 2002. On Tuesday morning, several hundred demonstrators blocked off one of the most important highways in Caracas and wreaked havoc in traffic, the daily El Nacional said. On Monday, at least 16 people were injured in clashes between students and security forces. National Guard units fired tear gas on students at several colleges in Caracas and Valencia. The authorities admitted that four students in Carabobo University, in central Venezuela, had bullet wounds but did not suggest who fired at them. Chavez said Tuesday that student protestors are being used as &#8220;cannon-fodder&#8221; by groups who seek to destabilize the country. &#8220;Those who are using them want there to be a few people dead,&#8221; the president noted. He also accused the opposition and private media of encouraging violence. &#8220;I am talking very clearly to those (&#8230;) who are trying to heat up the streets, with some media playing at destabilization - television stations, radio stations, some newspapers, sending messages to the armed forces trying to make some military officers rise, trying to set fire to the streets of Caracas,&#8221; Chavez accused. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva refused to comment Tuesday on the refusal to renew RCTV&#8217;s broadcasting licence. Lula told reporters in Brasilia that the decision adopted by the Chavez government &#8220;is a problem to do with Venezuela&#8217;s legislation.&#8221; However, one of Lula&#8217;s main allies - Senator and former president Jose Sarney - criticized Chavez on Tuesday in the Brazilian Senate. &#8220;There cannot be a democracy in which there are no free institutions, strong institutions, a free, strong and open Congress, a free and unrestricted press. From the moment that the government has the power to hush any kind of opposition, for any reason, from that moment I go on to fear for the concept of democracy in that country,&#8221; Sarney said. Chile&#8217;s governing Socialist Party compared the closure of RCTV to the censorship during Augusto Pinochet&#8217;s dictatorship (1973-90). The governments of Peru, Colombia and Mexico have also criticized the refusal to renew the licence. In several Latin American countries, television stations interrupted their programmes for several minutes in protest for the closure of RCTV. Baltazar Cardozo - archbishop of Merida, in Venezuela - compared Chavez&#8217;s media policy to those of Hitler and Mussolini.

Thursday, 31st May 2007 Thu 31 May 2007 Israel denounces British academic boycott call JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel sharply criticised on Thursday a decision by Britain's main college teachers' union to promote a boycott of Israeli academic institutions. The government, leading Israeli academics and newspapers all condemned the proposal, with some commentators saying they saw anti-Semitism and the influence of the country's growing Muslim community behind the latest boycott call. The government distanced itself from the move, which follows a boycott call from the country's main journalists union in April that also provoked widespread Israeli anger. The boycott call has however been criticised by some union members. The public service workers union, the largest union in the UK, is also set to propose a boycott on Israel at its annual conference next month, reports in Israel said. The University and College Union, an association of college professors and lecturers, passed a motion on Wednesday that its 120,000 members discuss a boycott of Israeli universities. The motion proposed that the union would send the "full text of the Palestinian boycott call to all branches for information and discussion". "We find it strange that British academics believe boycotting is a way to encourage dialogue and peace ... and believe in boycotting the only Middle East country that has a truly independent and free academia," said Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Mark Regev. Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni met with the British ambassador to Israel on Monday and said that both governments opposed the call to boycott. "The UK government fully supports academic freedom and is firmly against any academic boycotts of Israel or Israeli academics. I profoundly believe this does nothing to promote the Middle East peace process," said Bill Rammell, a British education minister. "It's actually an attempt to delegitimise the very existence of Israel. It is outrageous and against the spirit of academia," said Menachem Magidor, President of Hebrew University in Jerusalem. A group of Palestinian academics have accused Israel's academia of being "in direct or indirect collusion with the military intelligence establishment, providing it with 'academic' research services to sustain its oppression". Previous decisions by academics to boycott Israeli universities and colleges were overturned. (Additional reporting by Mohammed Assadi) (c) Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Suspect Blames British For Spy's Death Litvinenko Died Of Poisoning By Rare Radioactive Isotope POSTED: 5:49 am EDT May 31, 2007 Sign Up for Breaking News Alerts The Russian businessman whom Britain has named as a suspect in the killing of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko said Thursday that he has evidence of British special services' involvement in the poisoning death. "Even if (British special services) hadn't done it itself, it was done under its control or connivance," Andrei Lugovoi told a news conference. Asked if he had evidence for the allegation, he said "I have evidence" but did not elaborate. A British government security official, who demanded anonymity in exchange for discussing Lugovoi's claims because of the sensitivity of the case, said suggestions British intelligence had involvement in Litvinenko's death were spurious. Britain last week said it had enough evidence to charge Lugovoi, who also worked for the KGB and its main successor agency the FSB, in the November killing of Litvinenko. Litvinenko, who died of poisoning by the rare radioactive isotope polonium-210, had fled to Britain several years earlier after becoming a strong critic of the Kremlin and received British citizenship. Lugovoi and another Russian had met in London with Litvinenko on Nov. 1, the day Litvinenko said he became ill. Britain has requested Lugovoi's extradition, but Russia has refused, saying the constitution does not permit such extraditions. Lugovoi has repeatedly asserted he is not guilty in the matter. On Thursday, Lugovoi also claimed that Britain had tried to recruit him to provide intelligence. British special services "asked me to collect compromising information on President (Vladimir) Putin," Lugovoi said. Lugovoi said the attempted recruitment occurred during business trips to Britain in previous years. He did not give a precise date, but indicated the alleged approach occurred in late 2005 or early 2006. London's Foreign Office, responsible for the country's overseas secret intelligence service MI6, declined to comment on Lugovoi's claim. But another government official with knowledge of Lugovoi, who also demanded anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, said the allegations were untrue. . All rights reserved.

Go to a Section: 12:50PM EDT, Thu 31 May 2007 Malaysia's Lina Joy loses Islam conversion case Wed May 30, 2007 1:45AM EDT FACTBOX: Five facts on religion and apostasy in Malaysia Big win looms for French "Hyper President" Sarkozy High stakes for Africa at trial of warlord Taylor China urges patience on Sudan, opposes sanctions EU to spell out expectations, conditions to Serbia By Jalil Hamid and Syed Azman PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia (Reuters) - Malaysia's best known Christian convert, Lina Joy, lost a six-year battle on Wednesday to have the word "Islam" removed from her identity card, after the country's highest court rejected the change. The ruling threatens to further polarize Malaysian society between non-Muslims who feel that their constitutional right to religious freedom is being eroded, and Muslims who believe that civil courts have no right to meddle in Islamic affairs. "You can't at whim and fancy convert from one religion to another," Federal Court Chief Justice Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim said in delivering judgment in the case, which has stirred religious tensions in the mainly Muslim nation. He said the civil court had no jurisdiction in the case and that it should be dealt with by the country's Islamic courts. "The issue of apostasy is related to Islamic law, so it's under the sharia court. The civil court cannot intervene." About 200 mostly young Muslims welcomed the ruling outside the domed courthouse with shouts of "Allah-o-Akbar" (God is great), but Christians and non-Muslim politicians were dismayed. "I think it's a major blow," opposition politician Lim Kit Siang said. "It casts a large shadow on civil liberties and the constitutional rights of Malaysians." Malaysia's Council of Churches was saddened. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

A Shell spokesman said Wednesday that protesters from the K-Dere community in the Niger Delta invaded the Bomu pipeline complex on Monday and tampered with some equipment. Protesters occupied the same pipeline hub earlier this month, occupying it for six days and forcing a similar cut in production. Attacks and kidnappings have plagued Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta region since late 2005. The unrest has caused a 25 percent drop in Nigeria's oil production. In his inaugural address Tuesday, new Nigerian president Umaru Yar'dua said the unrest in the delta demands urgent attention and promised swift action to address it. Militants have been demanding that a greater share of the region's oil wealth be directed to impoverished local villages. Criminal gangs have taken advantage of the unrest. Some information for this report was provided by AP and Reuters.

Falluja police spokesman Hamid Abid said the bomber, wearing a suicide explosives vest, walked up to a queue of about 150 young men at a police recruitment centre and blew himself up. Abid put the total number of killed and wounded at between 45 and 50. Bilal Mohammed, a doctor at Falluja hospital, said 20 had been killed and 20 wounded. Falluja, 50 km (35 miles) west of Baghdad, is in restive Anbar province, a stronghold of Sunni Arab insurgency. Recruitment centers for Iraqi security forces are common targets for such attacks, which are mostly blamed on Sunni Islamist al Qaeda. Some Sunni Arab tribes in Anbar have been encouraging young men to join the Iraqi security forces in Anbar as part of a new strategy to combat al Qaeda in the area. Al Qaeda in turn has been waging a campaign against tribes who cooperate with authorities in Anbar. The U.S. military has more than 6,000 troops in Anbar, where local commanders have said that al Qaeda accounts for about 75 percent of militants in and around Falluja. &copy; Reuters 2007.

The Mehdi Army's spiritual leader, Moqtada al-Sadr, recently withdrew political support from the Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki. The Foreign Minister says yesterday's well-orchestrated kidnapping operation is an open challenge to the authority of the Government by Mr al-Sadr. TOM IGGULDEN, REPORTER: US and Iraqi forces are sweeping through Sadr City tonight in a desperate attempt to find the five Britons or extract information about their whereabouts. Locals say two were killed in the raids. The military is refusing to comment. DAN O'SHEA, FORMER HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR: I can guarantee that this is a tier one top notch focus effort. TOM IGGULDEN: The men were snatched from the Finance Ministry, just outside Baghdad's green zone on the edge of Sadr city. The abductors pulled up in up to 40 vehicles. Dressed in Iraqi paramilitary police fatigues, they swept past guard posts, entered the building and demanded, "Where are the foreigners?" One Briton got away and another five gave in without a fight. DAN O'SHEA: Because of the sensitivity of them being kidnapped at a finance - an actual ministry building, there will be close coordination at the highest levels of both the British Government, the American Government and the Iraqi Government. All efforts will be going out to fleece the street, find out who is involved and put pressure on the appropriate individuals to secure their release. TOM IGGULDEN: These were the types of uniforms the kidnappers were wearing. Shiite militants have infiltrated the paramilitary police, forming feared death squads operating outside the law to hunt down sectarian enemies, but so far there is no confirmation of the kidnappers' identities. The brazen snatching also has re-focused attention on the role of private security firms operating in Iraq. ROBIN HORSFALL, FORMER SAS OFFICER: The situation for civilian contractors working in Iraq is far more dangerous than it is for soldiers working in Iraq. They don't have the tactical backup, they don't have the quality of men to work alongside. In many cases they don't know who they're going to work with until they arrive in country. TOM IGGULDEN: May is now the deadliest month this year for the US military in Iraq after 10 soldiers were killed yesterday. A coordinated attack outside Baghdad killed eight. Two pilots died when their reconnaissance helicopter was downed by heavy machine gun fire. A Bradley fighting vehicle sent to investigate was then hit by a roadside bomb which killed five soldiers. A second armoured vehicle sent to rescue survivors was blown up by a second bomb, killing another soldier. The attacks show a new level of planning and roadside bomb technology from the insurgency. GENERAL MONTGOMERY MEIGS, US MILITARY: The person who is developing ways of penetrating armour is always going to have an advantage over the armour builder. TOM IGGULDEN: There was little to protect the 38 civilians who died in two separate car bombings yesterday in central Baghdad. Tom Iggulden, Lateline.

Security Council vote to set up a tribunal to try the killers of Rafik al-Hariri, the former prime minister's son said on Thursday. Pro-Syrian politicians and parties, including President Emile Lahoud and Hezbollah, said the United Nations had ridden roughshod over Lebanon's constitution and could provoke further divisions in a country still haunted by its 1975-90 civil war. The Security Council voted on Wednesday to set up the court after failed efforts to get its statutes constitutionally approved in Lebanon, where a political crisis has paralyzed normal government for months. Syria said after the vote that it could lead to more instability in Lebanon. Saad al-Hariri, the son and political heir of the slain premier, told Reuters the tribunal would end the impunity that political assassins have enjoyed in Lebanon for four decades. "How could the tribunal affect the security of Lebanon? How could punishing the people who killed Rafik al-Hariri... affect the security of Lebanon?" Hariri said in an interview. "If Lebanon is going to be unstable it is the doing of those who say that Lebanon is going to be unstable," he said. "They (the Syrians) won't be able to destabilize us because they tried before and they have failed." Hariri and his allies in the governing coalition accuse Syria of orchestrating the February 14, 2005 bombing which killed Hariri and 22 others in Beirut. They also say Damascus was behind a string of other attacks on anti-Syrian figures. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

Click here for the Sport on TV schedule for the week. [ h o m e ] Stubborn streak could cost Boks The Springboks latest drubbing of the English reveals a team in rude health, but in a World Cup year the one thing that may very well cost the Boks, is Jake White's extraordinary stubborn streak. Editor Rob Peters (L) and Assistant Ed Rory O'Connor (R) Mon, 04 Jun 2007 Helicopter crash kills 22 Mon, 04 Jun 2007 A helicopter that crashed in Sierra Leone killed at least 22 people on board, most of them Togolese sporting officials and fans, the operating airline's chief said on Monday. One person, a Russian co-pilot, survived the crash of the Russian made Mi-8. The privately owned Paramount Airlines helicopter exploded and caught fire while descending at the country's main Lungi airport late Sunday and crash landed on the runway. "I can confirm that 20 passengers died in addition to two Russians, one of them a pilot and the other a flight engineer," Denis Ivanov, Paramount Airlines' managing director told AFP. Sierra Leone's Transport Minister Prince Harding said an investigation is soon to be launched, but appealed "for international support to get it under way." Ivanov, whose company is on the European Union blacklist of airlines which bars it from EU airspace, said a technical fault was unlikely to have been the cause of the accident. "I was told there was an explosion on board from the passenger cabin just as the helicopter was coming to land. So I think we can rule out any technical problem for now," he said. Togo's Sports Minister Richard Attipoe and 19 other people, mainly sporting officials and football supporters, were killed aboard the shuttle helicopter taking them to the airport across the Sierra Leone river estuary from Freetown, sporting and aviation officials said. The Togolese government on Monday declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the crash and said it had sent a delegation to Freetown to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the accident. The bodies were taken early on Monday from Lungi to a government hospital in Freetown, according to the transport minister. Chernor Ojuku Sesay, spokesman for the Sierra Leone Football Association which hosted the Togolese said "most of the victims were burnt beyond recognition." "It's been so trying and hard on us all since the crash," said Ivanov. The victims were using the helicopter to return to the airport after attending the match in which the Togo national football team beat Sierra Leone 1-0 in an African cup of Nations elimination match. Paramount Airlines operates four blue, white and yellow helicopters which offer a seven minute shuttle service between Freetown and the airport. Alternative routes to the airport are either a 30 minute ferry ride or 110 kilometres (70 miles) by rough road. The Togolese team was in Freetown awaiting the next shuttle when the accident took place. "None of the players were involved. It was the Togolese coach who suggested that the team go on the second shuttle as they needed some rest after the match and this was what saved the day," said Sesay. The team and officials had chartered a jet and were due to fly back home Sunday evening. Firefighters, police and the army only succeeded in extinguishing the blazing aircraft several hours after it crashed, airport workers said. "We are deeply moved over this development. We are also grieved by this tragic loss," said Nahim Khadi, president of the Sierra Leone Football Association. Sports fans in Freetown were wearing black armbands Monday as a sign of mourning. Paramount's helicopters and other helicopters plying the route in this poverty stricken country were grounded in January for security checks and re-certification by authorities and resumed operations a month later.

http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0605/p01s04-woap.html&cid China balks at emissions caps | csmonitor.com Letter to the Editor from the June 5, 2007 edition China balks at emissions caps China's first plan to confront climate change cites growth as its top priority. | Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor Page 1 of 3 China echoed the Bush administration's stance on global warming Monday, refusing to set firm caps on its greenhouse-gas emissions and saying that economic growth remained its "first and overriding priority." Releasing the country's first plan to deal with climate change, the government rejected international demands that it should fix ceilings on Chinese emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. Instead, the plan acknowledges the threat global warming poses to China's economic growth and outlines energy conservation measures, new technologies, and alternative energy sources to cut the country's net CO2 output. China's reluctance to set firm limits on emissions will further complicate the efforts that European nations have launched to set new and binding greenhouse-gas limits when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2013. "The plan sets a basic framework on which China can build but falls short of setting acceptable targets" said one European diplomat. "Hopefully we can get them to that point." China â€“ the second largest source of greenhouse gases after the United States â€“ would "shoulder its share of responsibility for global climate change," said Ma Kai, China's minister of economic planning. But "China does not commit to any quantified emissions-reduction commitments," he added. Released two days before President Hu Jintao attends a meeting of the G-8 in Germany that is expected to focus on climate change, the Chinese plan sets out a series of measures designed to check the country's greenhouse-gas emissions. Though clearly timed to give Mr. Hu ammunition with which to fend off critics, the report's real significance, say experts here, is the fact it was released under the auspices of China's top governing body, the State Council, or cabinet. "The State Council is paying attention, and that is much, much more important than the substance itself," said Pan Jiahua, a member of the panel that drafted the plan. "This is very much a sign that climate change is really going to be on the agenda." "The biggest problem," cautions Yang Ailun, an energy analyst with the environmental watchdog Greenpeace, "is going to be implementation. It is difficult to translate national ambitions to local implementation when local officials are obsessed with economic development at any price."

National security adviser Stephen Hadley, speaking to reporters as Bush was traveling to Prague, said that Hariri requested the conversation. Hadley said he expressed his appreciation for U.S. support in arranging an international tribunal to prosecute suspects in the assassination of his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article "He also expressed appreciation for the support the United States is providing to the Lebanese armed forces as they deal with the security challenge associated with the refugee camp where they are engaged with dealing with extremist forces around that camp," Hadley said The United States and allied Arab countries have airlifted ammunition and supplies to help the Lebanese army in its showdown with the Fatah Islam group in a Palestinian refugee camp near Tripoli in northern Lebanon. Islamic militants elsewhere have voiced support for Fatah Islam, which has threatened to take the battle outside northern Lebanon. Hadley did not directly answer a question as to whether Hariri had asked for any other help during the phone call. "There is ongoing cooperation between the United States and the Lebanese Armed Forces to identify additional requirements that they need," Hadley said. "Some of those have already been provided; some will be provided in the future." "There are some additional items that are already under consideration that we are talking about with the Lebanese forces," the senior-level Bush adviser said. Hadley gave no specifics but said the discussions were being handled by the Defense Department. He did not characterize Bush's side of the conversation. The call was shortly after Bush took off for Europe, where he will attend a summit meeting of the major industrialized countries later this week in Germany.

The New York Times The New York Times Published: June 4, 2007, 10:13 AM PDT BEIJING--China on Monday released its first comprehensive strategy on addressing climate change, a plan that calls for improving energy efficiency and controlling greenhouse gas emissions but that rejects mandatory caps on emissions that could harm the country's sizzling economy. "Our general stance is that China will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets, but that does not mean we will not assume responsibilities in responding to climate change," said Ma Kai, head of China's powerful economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission. The 62-page report unveiled by Ma is dense with figures and programs on subjects like reforestation, public education and improving regulatory enforcement. But, in broad terms, the plan merely restated Beijing's position that mandatory emissions caps are unfair to China and other developing countries that are still trying to modernize and improve their living standards. China has the world's fastest-growing major economy and had been projected to surpass the United States by 2009 or 2010 as the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which scientists say cause global warming. But China's high-polluting economy is growing so rapidly that the International Energy Agency is now predicting the country could become the global emissions leader as soon as this year. The IEA also projected that if China does nothing to restrain emissions, it could produce more carbon dioxide during the next 25 years than all the world's richest 26 countries combined--including the United States, Japan, Europe and others. This week, Chinese President Hu Jintao is scheduled to join President Bush and other world leaders in Germany at an expanded meeting of the Group of 8 industrialized nations, in which global warming is on the agenda. Bush has been regularly criticized for his lack of action over global warming, but on Friday he proposed a new negotiating framework among the 15 countries that produce the most . Each country would establish its own targets and plan to reduce emissions in the next 10 or 20 years, while working as a group to set a long-term global goal. At his news conference Monday, Ma applauded Bush's proposal but said that it should complement, not replace, the existing framework, including the 1997 Kyoto Protocol sponsored by the United Nations. Under the Kyoto Protocol, which took effect in 2005, industrialized nations are subjected to caps on certain industrial emissions, while developing countries, including China and India, are exempt. The Bush administration pulled out of the agreement because it did not include China or India. Ma used his news conference to restate China's long-standing position that countries in the developed world, particularly the United States, needed to be the leaders on finding a solution because those countries had generated the overwhelming majority of greenhouse emissions since the Industrial Revolution. He said China historically had produced only a small fraction of the world's greenhouse gases and that its current per capita emissions equaled roughly one-fifth the rate in the United States. "The ramifications of limiting the development of developing countries would be even more serious than those from climate change," Ma said. The centerpiece of China's approach to controlling emissions is a plan initiated in 2005 that calls for a 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency by 2010. Ma noted that China had passed new laws on environmental protection and energy efficiency and that factories across the country were beginning to improve. He said fiscal and tax policies were being revised to reward clean industry and punish energy-intensive, high-polluting factories. But given China's high annual rate of economic growth, the program would, at best, slow increases in emissions rather than reduce them. And it is far from certain that China will be able to meet the 20 percent goal. Under the plan, China should have netted a 4 percent reduction in 2006 in the amount of energy needed to generate each unit of gross domestic product. Instead, environmental officials announced earlier this year that the country had already failed to meet that initial goal. China is heavily dependent on coal, which currently accounts for roughly 68 percent of its energy. Under the climate change program, China plans a major expansion of nuclear power, as well as renewable energy sources. The plan calls for renewable energy to account for 10 percent of the country's power supply by 2010. China is also in the midst of a nationwide reforestation program to help absorb greenhouse gases. Ma said China was strongly encouraging domestic research on new clean technologies but he also called on developed countries to transfer technology, and provide financial assistance, to help developing countries. The report also painted a brief, if alarming, picture of how global warming could change China, including rising sea levels, shrinking glaciers in Tibet, rising temperatures and the likelihood of expanding deserts. By 2020, annual temperatures could rise between 1.3 degrees to 2.1 degrees Celsius from 2000. In addition, projections show that Chinese agricultural output could be reduced by 10 percent by 2030.

With key roads blocked, commuters had a tough time reaching their destinations Monday morning. The protests started last Tuesday, when the Gujjars, who had blocked highways in West Indian state Rajasthan, clashed with police, leaving dozens dead and over a hundred injured. The Gujjars have been demanding the Scheduled Tribe status from the government so that they can enjoy special privileges. Hundreds of agitators Monday blocked key roads linking the capital, leading to traffic jams at all entry points to New Delhi. All Indian media channels reported that security has been beefed up at roads along the Delhi border with neighboring states and that Capital-bound vehicles were being diverted to alternate routes. Television channels flashed pictures of Army patrolling several areas. All television channels also showed pictures of protesters damaging buses, pelting police with stones, blocking highways and burning effigies of the Rajasthan Chief Minister. The government is trying to resolve the crisis but there has been no solution in sight so far. Comment on the story Copyright by People's Daily Online, all rights reserved

Border tensions increased over the weekend as Kurdistan Patriotic Unity (KYB) forces stopped a team of Turkish special forces in northern Iraq. Turkey's Chief of General Staff Gen. Yaþar Büyükanýt, hinted on Thursday at potential combat with Barzani's forces in northern Iraq if Turkish troops cross the border. Troop movements on Turkey's southeastern border have prompted speculation of a possible incursion into Iraq's largely autonomous northern Kurdish region. "We would prefer that we continue to work through this problem with them to try and safeguard Turkey, and hope that there will not be unilateral military action across the border into Iraq,” Robert Gates, U.S. Secretary of Defense, on Sunday told a news briefing at an Asian security conference in Singapore. “The Turks have a genuine concern about Kurdish terrorism,” Gates said. “We have been working with the Turks to try and help them get control of this problem on Turkish soil.” Asked whether U.S. pressure for a non-military response was being heeded in Ankara, Gates said: “We have had ongoing discussions with Turkish officials.” Rice urges Turkey as well Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, on Saturday, speaking to reporters on board a flight to Madrid, noted that any conflict at the border would not help to secure stability in Iraq. Rice also said Turkey and the United States are in close contact to solve the complex situation. Another commentary about a possible Turkish incursion came from Baghdad on Saturday. Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki called on Turkey not to send its troops into northern Iraq, urging Ankara to tone down its threats of military intervention. “If there are problems we shouldn't resort to threats, force and weapons because this worsens the problems,” Maliki said at a news conference with Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani in Arbil. “We do not want to harm neighboring countries, but we also do not want neighboring countries to interfere with military raids,” he said. Barzani also urged Turkey to tone down its threats of military intervention. “I hope it is internal rhetoric and they are not considering solving their problems through war, because war never resolved anyone's problems,” he said. An incident occurred on Friday in Sulaimaniya between a team of Turkish special forces and the KYB's local Peshmerga forces, sparking new tension in the region. Armed Peshmerga forces stopped the Turkish team and asked them for identification documents. The incident ended without casualties. However, the Turkish military demanded Iraqi Kurdish groups not repeat such episodes in the future, hinting that an armed conflict could take place. The Turkish Foreign Ministry corresponded with the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Ross Wilson, and asked him to urge Kurdish groups in northern Iraq not to play games any longer, daily Hürriyet reported yesterday. “These are dangerous games,” the daily quoted a high-level official. “Tell them to be intelligent.” On the other hand, the KYB officials on Saturday said that as Turkish forces were in civil attire, the Peshmerga forces could not identify them. KYB's Ankara Representative, Bahruz Galali, apologized to Turkish officials for the episode and said they will take measures not to repeat such occurrences. Turkish troops shell the border? Turkish troops shelled a border area in northern Iraq early Sunday in an attack on terrorists of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) based in the region, Belgium-based Fýrat news agency reported. The report could not immediately be confirmed. Citing the terrorist PKK, Fýrat news agency said Turkish artillery targeted the Hakurk area in northern Iraq and that no casualties were reported. The PKK have long had camps in the area, which is 15 kilometers from the Turkish border. &copy; 2005 Dogan Daily News Inc.

Commissioned jointly by WWF and Allianz Group, one of the world's largest insurance companies, the report evaluated measures that the eight major industrialized countries have undertaken to fight climate change, and ranked their relative performance. It's being issued to coincide with the annual G8 summit of Western leaders that starts Wednesday in Germany, where global warming is one of the top agenda items. Among the advanced countries, the report singled out three for their particularly poor records - Canada, the United States, and Russia - saying their policies to fight global warming aren't sufficient to contain the expected rise in the world's temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius. Many scientists predict that if the amount is exceeded, it could lead to catastrophic climate change. &#34;The United States scores the worst of all G8 countries, not having ratified the Kyoto Protocol, nor having put any substantive federal measures in place to curb emissions in the short term,&#34; the report said. &#34;Russia and Canada also have increasing emissions and no policy in place.&#34; Print Edition - Section Front IT TAKES A TOWER The report singled out the Canadian government, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, as having &#34;taken up a policy stand, which puts it sharply at odds with its Kyoto obligations as an advanced industrialized country.&#34; Canada also has the poorest record among the G8 when it comes to meeting its Kyoto target to reduce greenhouse gases. Under the pact, Canada needs to cut emissions by 6 per cent from 1990 levels, but they have actually grown 33 per cent above the target, the worst record among the club of the eight rich nations. The United States has also indicated it doesn't want to agree to a G8 statement that would include a commitment to keep warming below the 2-degree danger threshold. Industrialized countries would have to cut emissions by at least 30 per cent by 2020 and then undertake further large reductions - possibly as much as 80 per cent - by 2050 to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees, according to the report. The report said Italy and Japan have marginally better records than Canada, the United States and Russia, but they do not have the type of policies that are needed if the world is to avoid dangerous warming. Britain, Germany and France are &#34;furthest along&#34; the track toward big emission reductions, it said. Among its other findings, the report said: The United States: It is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, with the highest per capita emissions. The country hasn't ratified Kyoto and hasn't put in place &#34;any substantive federal measures&#34; to curb emissions. Canada: It has a record similar to the United States, with high per capita emissions and &#34;inadequate&#34; mid- to long-term greenhouse-gas-reduction targets. Russia: Emissions declined in the early 1990s, but are now increasing again. The country has &#34;hardly any policy in place to curb emissions.&#34; Britain: Its emissions have met Kyoto requirements, due to a switch from coal as a fuel to gas. Germany: Emissions declined from 1990 to 2000, partly due to the economic collapse of East Germany, but the country has also had a successful program of promoting renewable energy and fosters strong national debate about global warming.

"The security of the United States and the security of European allies is indivisible," Dr Rice said on the margins of the Organisation of American States gathering here. "It doesn't really help anybody to start threatening Europeans." Dr Rice said US officials "don't consider Russia an adversary and I hope they don't consider the United States an adversary". She noted Washington and Moscow "are cooperating in a whole range of things", including nuclear proliferation, Iran, North Korea and terrorism. "This is 2007 and not 1987," Dr Rice said. "This isn't the Soviet Union and we need to drop the rhetoric that sounds like what the United States and the Soviet Union used to say about each other, and realise that the United States and Russia are in a very different period." Dr Rice said US officials "have been very active in talking to the Russians about this, not just explaining, but exploring it. We are prepared to do more of that". The White House described Mr Putin's latest comments in a missile defence feud with the US as being "not helpful". Mr Putin recently talked openly of a "new arms race" and warned that Russia would have new targets in Europe if Washington went ahead with plans to place elements of a missile defence system in the Czech Republic and Poland, countries once under Moscow's rule but now members of NATO.

By Merdijana Sadovic in Sarajevo for IWPR (04/06/07) One of three most wanted war crimes fugitives sought by the Hague Tribunal, Bosnian Serb army general Zdravko Tolimir, was arrested this week near the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica, as he tried to cross the border with Serbia. Tolimir - one of the closest aides of top war crimes fugitive general Ratko Mladic - was indicted in 2005 for his alleged role in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. Charges against him include genocide and complicity to commit genocide, as well as crimes against humanity. The operation which led to his capture was carried out by the Republika Srpska (RS) police, who acted on a tip-off from the Serbian interior ministry. It's the first time RS authorities, who have long been criticized for not cooperating with the Hague tribunal, have apprehended an individual indicted by the court. The Bosnian daily Avaz reported this week that on 31 May, Serbian police informed RS authorities that a high-ranking war crimes fugitive had attempted to cross the border with Serbia during the day. Shortly after that, RS police, supported by the state police and European forces deployed in Bosnia, EUFOR, blocked the border crossing between Bratunac in Bosnia and Ljubovija in Serbia, only a few kilometers from Srebrenica. Heavily armed Serbian police were deployed on the other side of the border, ready to prevent Tolimir from crossing over. According to the sources in Serbia and RS, the whole operation was over in less than two hours. It was not immediately clear whether Tolimir resisted the arrest. RS premier Miroslav Dodik personally informed the Hague Tribunal about the outcome of the arrest operation, the local media reported. Tolimir, who apparently has some serious health problems, was later transferred to Sarajevo, where he underwent medical check-ups. The indictee allegedly suffered two strokes recently, but although his health condition is quite serious, he was transferred to The Hague on 1 June. During the 1992-95 Bosnian war, Tolimir, 58, served as the assistant commander of intelligence and security on the main staff of the Bosnian Serb army, VRS, reporting directly to Mladic. He was indicted in February 2005 for his alleged role in the crimes committed in Srebrenica and Zepa in July 1995. He was supposed to stand trial with seven other Bosnian Serb army and police officials - Vujadin PopoviÄ‡, LjubiÅ¡a Beara, Drago NikoliÄ‡, Ljubomir BorovÄanin, Radivoje MiletiÄ‡, Milan Gvero and Vinko PandureviÄ‡ - but because he was still on the run at the time the trial was due to start, his indictment was separated from the others in August 2006. Hague tribunal officials welcomed Tolimir's arrest and said they hoped "those believed to be most responsible for the genocide in Srebrenica, Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, will follow suit." "This arrest is extremely significant," the EU Special Representative to Bosnia Christian Schwarz-Schilling said in a statement issued on 1 June. "On the one hand, an important war crimes suspect, charged with genocide, will now face justice. On the other, the arrest itself was, for the first time, carried out by the RS police." Schwarz-Schilling added that although nearly 12 years have passed since genocide was committed in Srebrenica, the need to bring those responsible to justice is "as great today as it was in 1995." "I expect the RS police to build on [this week's] success and to help deliver all remaining war crimes suspects rapidly to justice, in particular, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic," reads the statement. The survivors of the Srebrenica genocide were also pleased with the arrest, said that it was long overdue. "This is good news for the victims, but it should have happened 12 years ago. Tolimir had 12 years to enjoy his freedom," Munira Subasic, the head of the Association of Women from Srebrenica, told Reuters news agency. Some observers say Tolimir's arrest is an important breakthrough in a shaky relationship between the RS and the tribunal. For almost 12 years, the Bosnian Serb authorities had resisted the international pressure to cooperate with the tribunal and bring war crimes suspects to justice. So it seems, the timing of the arrest was almost perfect for the RS and Serbia. Over the last week, the RS police and judiciary have been heavily criticised for allowing a man convicted of war crimes in eastern Bosnia, Radovan Stankovic, to escape while serving his 20-year-sentence in Foca prison, which is under RS police jurisdiction. Stankovic, whose case was the first to be transferred to Bosnia, was recently convicted by the Bosnian war crimes court for wartime rapes in Foca. His escape and the sloppy investigation into the incident placed the RS authorities under renewed scrutiny. Banja Luka will be hoping that Tolimir's arrest will get it out of tight spot. The arrest couldn't have come at a better moment for Serbia either. Military analyst Aleksandar RadiÄ‡ told Belgrade Television B92 that the result of this successful operation will certainly be new talks on Stabilisation and Association Agreement between Brussels and Belgrade, which is the first step towards Serbia's membership of the EU. Serbian officials also expect the tribunal's chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte, whose visit to Belgrade is scheduled for the beginning of June, will see the arrest as a sign that Serbia is willing to cooperate fully with the Hague tribunal. Out of 161 persons indicted by the tribunal, five remain at large. They are Mladic, Karadzic, former president of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serb Krajina Goran Hadzic, wartime commander of the Bosnian Serb police Stojan Zupljanin and ex-Serbian police general Vlastimir Djordjevic. Apart from Djordjevic, they are all believed to be hiding in Serbia and RS. Merdijana Sadovic is IWPR's Hague program manager.

http://www.forbes.com/business/feeds/afx/2007/06/04/afx3784555.html&cid Israel military court imprisons Hamas ministers for six months - Forbes.com Israel military court imprisons Hamas ministers for six months 06.04.07, 11:02 AM ET BETHLEHEM, West Bank (Thomson Financial) - An Israeli military court ordered today that two Palestinian ministers and a member of parliament from Islamist movement Hamas be held without charge for six months, their lawyers said. The court in northern Israel placed Education Minister Nasseredin al-Shaer, Minister of State Wasfi Qabha and MP Abdelrahman Zeidan in administrative detention for six months, the lawyers said. There was no immediate confirmation from the army of the detention orders against the three politicians, whose arrests drew rare criticism from Israel's key ally, the United States. Administrative detainees can be held without charge for an indefinite period, although their detention orders need periodic renewal by the military courts. The three politicians were arrested along with 31 other senior Hamas officials in the occupied West Bank as part of a crackdown that Israel launched against the Islamist movement nearly three weeks ago in response to increased rocket fire from the Gaza Strip. The US State Department said the arrests of Palestinian elected officials raised 'particular concern', while France condemned the Israeli action. The crackdown on Hamas came as Israel resumed deadly air strikes against the Gaza Strip on May 16 in response to a sharp increase in militant rocket fire from the territory. Last year, the army detained more than 60 Hamas officials, including four ministers, after the group's military wing claimed joint responsibility for the capture of an Israeli soldier in a deadly cross-border raid from Gaza in June, which led to the Israeli bombing of Lebanon. Thirty-nine members of parliament and two former ministers remain in custody from that crackdown. Shaer, who was then deputy prime minister, was also detained in that sweep but a military court ordered him released a month later due to lack of evidence. Copyright AFX News Limited 2007.

Hundreds of aftershocks sent jittery residents scurrying for safety. "We worry so much about the aftershocks. This morning we had one, and we hid anyplace we could think of," said Cai Zhongting, who was living with his family in a tent. The quake struck near China&#039;s border with Laos shortly after 5:30 a.m. Sunday (2130 GMT Saturday), said China&#039;s official Xinhua News Agency, citing the government&#039;s seismological bureau. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake&#039;s magnitude at 6.2. Xinhua said 20 of the injured were seriously hurt. The dead included a 4-year-old boy who was sleeping with his mother when the mud walls of their home collapsed, burying them, Xinhua said. The mother was later rescued. Today in Asia - Pacific Hong Kong remembers Tiananmen Beijing climate-change strategy has no emission caps Philippine troops defuse bus bomb after U.S. warning Xinhua, citing a provincial civil affairs spokesman, said 120,000 people had been forced to leave their homes. About 20,000 to 30,000 of them were living in tents, some marked "disaster relief," because the earthquake cracked walls in many buildings and made them unsafe to enter, said a man at the Ning&#039;er County Seismological Bureau, who gave only his surname, Ma. Another official from the seismological bureau, who identified himself by his surname, Ye, said others were living without shelter because of a shortage of tents. He said more tents were being sent from other areas. Ma said the local government was providing food and water to displaced residents, although Cai said he and his family &#8212; his wife, 11-year-old daughter and three grandparents &#8212; had to scrounge for supplies themselves in hot, mosquito-infested accommodations. Some businesses opened Monday, including a branch of the Agricultural Bank of China, which was running on generators and providing food and water to six employees, including Cai, who spoke to The Associated Press from the bank. Li Yan, another resident, said she had food but no running water. "My family and I can&#039;t brush our teeth or take showers because of the water shortage. I am drinking mineral water provided by my unit," said Li, reached by telephone at her office. More than 300 aftershocks had been recorded by the local seismic bureau, Xinhua reported, including one with a magnitude of 5.1. Ning&#039;er lies in a quake-prone mountainous region in Yunnan province about 150 kilometers (90 miles) north of Laos, and is famous for its strong tea, known as Pu&#039;er. For centuries, the area sat astride an important trade route for tea and horses that ran along western China between central Asia and southeastern Asia. From 2001 to 2006, Yunnan recorded 27 earthquakes with magnitudes of at least 5.0, Xinhua said. In 1988, a magnitude 7.1 quake in Yunnan near the border with Myanmar killed more than 930 people. More than 15,000 people died after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake in the province in 1970.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/04/world/asia/04cnd-hong.html&cid Chinese Commemorate 18th Anniversary of Tiananmen Crackdown - New York Times Chinese Commemorate 18th Anniversary of Tiananmen Crackdown A candlelight vigil in Hong Kong this evening to mark the 18th anniversary of the military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square demonstrations drew an unusually large crowd. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: June 4, 2007 HONG KONG, June 4 — A candlelight vigil here this evening to mark the 18th anniversary of the military crackdown on the Tiananmen Square demonstrations drew an unusually large crowd, apparently in response to the recent assertion by the leader of Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing party that no massacre took place in 1989. By contrast, Tiananmen Square itself, in Beijing, remained quiet under tight security through a humid, sunny day, with the usual tour groups and pedestrians milling about. State security agents had already placed several well-known dissidents under house arrest or close watch, though some of those detained described the harassment as more passive than in years past. Some dissidents communicated through websites established to commemorate the anniversary. Hu Jia, a leading Chinese advocate on issues like , said he and others have been confined to their homes, but that the authorities had shown a few small signs of leniency. He said Ding Zilin, a leader of a group known as the Tiananmen Mothers, was allowed to commemorate the death of her son by visiting one of the famous sites where soldiers fired upon pro-democracy demonstrators. In Hong Kong, the Tiananmen Square killings are once more a subject of active discussion following remarks three weeks ago by Ma Lik, the chairman of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong. Mr. Ma told local reporters on May 15 that Hong Kong people lacked patriotic devotion to China because they believed that the Communist Party had massacred people at Tiananmen Square. Mr. Ma contended that Hong Kong residents were too willing to believe versions of events in 1989 that were released by “gweilos,” a slightly derogatory local term for Westerners. He went on to suggest that the city would not be ready to be granted full democracy by Beijing until 2022 as a result. China experts have debated for years whether hundreds of people or thousands of people were killed in the military crackdown on Tiananmen Square demonstrators, but they agree that soldiers shot large numbers of people. Mr. Ma did not say whether he believed that any deaths had occurred, but suggested that whatever happened did not constitute a massacre. Mr. Ma described his remarks a day later as “rash and frivolous,” but maintained his position that no massacre had taken place. Mr. Ma did not answer calls to his cell phone last month or today. Public debate over Mr. Ma’s remarks appeared to increase the turnout at this evening’s vigil. Organizers estimated the crowd at 55,000 people, while and police put it at 27,000, the most to attend the annual vigil since 2004, when organizers claimed a crowd of 82,000 while police said 48,000. Organizers estimated last year’s crowd at 44,000, while police put it at 19,000. The turnout in 2004 was extremely large because Hong Kong was nearing the end of a year-long flourishing of pro-democracy sentiment. touched off by the local government’s unsuccessful attempt to introduce a stringent internal security law. Yip Wingki, a 32-year-old salesman, said that he had not attended any previous vigils, but came this evening with his 7-year-old son because he was offended by Mr. Ma’s remarks. “He warped the truth totally,” he said as his son sleepily held a lit candle in the sweltering heat. Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun, the Roman Catholic bishop of Hong Kong and a senior adviser to the on China policy, denounced the Tiananmen Square killings at a small prayer meeting held in the same large park as the vigil but an hour earlier. “Our comrades who were shot to death in Tiananmen Square and the surrounding streets were very patriotic, and they came forward to chastise corrupt people in power and to ask for a push toward democracy,” he said. “The violent response took away those young lives and assigned them the criminal label of being rioters. This is a great shame on our country’s history.” But most of Cardinal Zen’s remarks were more cautious and more focused on the Bible’s teachings than last year, when he accused China’s current leaders of tolerating corruption, huge inequalities of wealth, coal mine disasters, and the sale of fake medicines. And while Cardinal Zen wore his red and white robes as a cardinal for his speech last year, having just come from the Catholic cathedral here, he chose this evening to wear the simple black shirt and white clerical collar of a priest. A year ago, the Vatican was upset with Beijing officials over the consecration of two bishops without papal approval. The Vatican and Beijing have engaged in low-profile talks since then, with the goal of someday establishing diplomatic relations, and both sides have toned down their rhetoric. Organizers concluded the vigil this evening by urging participants to join an annual pro-democracy march on July 1, which this year will mark the tenth anniversary of Britain’s return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule. President of China is expected here for the anniversary, and Chinese officials will be watching the march closely for any sign of resurgent interest in democracy.

MOGADISHU - Violent attacks and retaliation by security forces led to the deaths of two police officers and five civilians in Mogadishu Monday, a day after Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi escaped a suicide car bomb attack. In an escalation of violence in the war-wracked capital, Ethiopian and Somali forces killed three civilians and wounded five others after a failed hand grenade attack, while police killed two civilians after two police officers were shot dead, witnesses said. The attacks also followed a deadly weekend assault in northeastern Somalia by security forces and a US warship against suspected extremists. The grenade attack was the second failed strike Monday on Ethiopian-Somali troops in the northern district of Huriwa. "Immediately after the grenade was thrown at the Ethiopian-Somali convoy, they opened heavy fire in the direction it came from," witness Ahmed Ismail said. It was unclear who carried out the attack but many civilians had been standing at a nearby bus stop and small roadside market, he said. "The three died immediately after the troops opened fire and their bodies have been collected by local elders," said witness Abdullahi Daud. "Some other people might have been hurt further away because stray bullets were flying everywhere." Ethiopian and Somali forces were not immediately available for comment. In southern Mogadishu, a gunman shot dead two policemen during an operation to disarm civilians in the Bakara market area, and police shot dead two civilians after the attack, witnesses said. "A policeman was shot dead by a man who was armed with a pistol and minutes later another policemen tried to arrest the man and he killed him too," said witness Ahmed Nur Ali. Police reinforcements arrived shortly after the attack and opened fire, killing two civilians, he said. "I have seen the bodies of the two civilians carried on a wheelbarrow," said Bashir Mohamed, another witness. Police sealed off the area and the attacker escaped, he added. Government and United Nations officials, African Union peacekeeping troops and Ethiopian soldiers have been targeted in a growing number of Iraq-style homemade bomb and suicide attacks, mainly in the seaside capital. The prime minister escaped a suicide car bomb attack on his Mogadishu compound Sunday that killed six of his security guards. "The terrorists are still hiding in the country, particularly in Mogadishu, to carry out violent actions like this. We will crack down on them and we will no longer give them a chance to hide in the community," Gedi told journalists at his compound on Monday. Ethiopian troops helped Somali forces drive out the Islamic courts movement at the start of the year which triggered the recent conflict after relative calm during the six moths of Islamists’ rule.

It is quiet and prosperous, and US troops are welcomed by the population there. But this can all crumble in the next six to nine months if Washington is not careful. Neighboring Turkey, alarmed at the emergence of a Kurdish state in northern Iraq and the presence of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) there, may throw caution to the wind by engaging in a cross-border military operation. Such an event is likely to pit Ankara, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally, against both the United States and its Kurdish allies. Fighting between Turks and Kurds in Iraq could spread to Turkey itself and, in the end, lead to a severe rupture in US-Turkish relations. An unstable and violent northern Iraq would deal a fatal blow to the United States' Iraq project by accelerating, widening and deepening the current inter-communal carnage. Turkey, which has a sizable and restive Kurdish minority of its own, is fearful of the demonstration effect of the gains achieved by Iraqi Kurds. It has tried to resist not only Kurdish independence but also Kurds' attempts at incorporating the oil-rich city of Kirkuk into their area, thereby facilitating any future bid for independence. Renewed confrontations with the PKK in Turkey with concomitant increases in casualties have further soured the Turkish mood and have contributed to the rise of xenophobic nationalism and political instability in that country. The Turks blame the Iraq war for creating the conditions that have given rise to a potential independent Kurdish state. They also accuse the US of ignoring Turkish red lines on Kirkuk and federalism and demands to take action against the PKK. In fact, Turks are convinced that the US prefers its newfound Kurdish friends to its old NATO ally. Widespread disaffection with the US - exacerbated by politicians, pundits and generals - has translated into increasing public pressure for a unilateral Turkish move into Iraq. Ankara has also stepped up its attacks on the approach of Iraqi Kurds to Kirkuk, accusing them of forcibly changing the demographics of the city and mistreating the Turkoman population, with whom Turkey has cultivated ties. It wants Washington to use its influence to prevent Iraqi Kurds from incorporating Kirkuk into the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) through a referendum mandated by the Iraqi constitution to take place by the end of this year. Last August, with Turkish patience waning, a move into northern Iraq was averted by last-minute diplomacy and the appointment of a special US negotiator, retired General Joseph Ralston, to work with the Turks on the PKK. Although both the United States and Turkey are well aware of the stakes involved, the fact remains that the continued stalemate is hostage to a flare-up of violence, a miscalculation or even an accident, especially now that Turkey will be beset with uncertainty as it struggles with its constitutional crisis after last month's failed presidential election. If current trends hold, Iraq's future will be determined by the separation of its three communities - whether this is within a loose federation or through three independent states. No amount of threats will alter a final outcome that may not be to the liking of either Washington or Ankara. Ankara's options are quite limited. Turkey can actively align itself with Iran and Syria, two other neighboring countries with sizable and restless Kurdish populations of their own, to prevent the Kurds from achieving their goals. Such an alignment, however, would seriously undermine Iraq's already tenuous future and run afoul of the Americans and the Europeans. A large anti-PKK cross-border military intervention risks embroiling the Turks in a guerrilla campaign with Iraqi Kurds that, as the Americans have discovered, they cannot win. Such an action would have extremely serious ramifications for Ankara's standing with the United States and the European Union. Moreover, Turkey's Kurdish regions would erupt in violence were the Turks to intervene against their Iraqi brethren. Finally, Ankara has also closed the door on prospective amnesty for PKK fighters other than the leadership cadres for fear of appearing irresolute. Today, domestic-nationalist considerations drive a war of words between Ankara and Iraq's Kurds over Kirkuk. Nevertheless, the Turks' fear of their own Kurdish minority - estimated at 20% of their population - is as neuralgic as it is existential. Since the inception of the Turkish republic in 1923, Turkish Kurds, in one form or another, have agitated for greater rights and recognition. These efforts at times assumed a violent character, as with the PKK-led insurgency in the 1980s and 1990s, or more often than not have followed a path of increased political mobilization. Either form of activity has been seen as dangerous by the Turkish state, which until a little more than a decade ago had refused to acknowledge the Kurds' existence. The fear of further Kurdish mobilization in Turkey has hampered Ankara's cooperation with the KRG. Ankara has tried its best to ignore the KRG's existence on the grounds that the Iraqi constitution has yet to assume its final and definitive shape. Outgoing Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, despite his government's entreaties, has obstinately refused to invite Iraqi President Jalal Talabani to Ankara simply because the latter is a Kurd from northern Iraq. The Turkish chief of the General Staff, General Yasar Buyukanit, forced the cancellation of an unofficial meeting between the Turkish foreign minister and KRG Prime Minister Nechrivan Barzani by publicly admonishing his government for meeting with people he claimed were "supporting the PKK militarily". For the civilian and military establishment and its allies, Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the Kurds represent the most pressing dangers facing the republic - Islamic fundamentalism and separatism. These domestic tensions are being played out against the backdrop of a nationalist revival, increasing xenophobia and anti-Western feelings. Turks are being fed a daily barrage of news that not only accentuates these sentiments but recounts and warns of massacres of Turkomans in Iraq, whether in Kirkuk or Tal Afar. For all these reasons, the Iraq dossier has come to represent the Turkish government's Achilles' heel. It is vulnerable to accusations of being soft on Iraqi Kurds, the US and the PKK presence in Iraq. Unable to undermine its overwhelming parliamentary majority, the anti-AKP establishment has tried to force the government's hand to initiate some kind of cross-border military operation against the express will of the US military in Iraq and Iraqi Kurds. The Turkish government - especially Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan - has contributed to these tensions by adopting a combative stance of its own. Erdogan, to protect his nationalist flank, has publicly said Turkey will not remain a spectator to events in Kirkuk, thereby raising the specter of an intervention and outpacing the military. The Kurds have assumed erroneously that their privileged position in Iraq protects them from the vagaries of both US and Turkish policies. Barzani's discourse has had an inflammatory impact on the Turkish domestic political scene, and Washington not only has to impress on the Kurds the precariousness of their current situation but also make use of its considerable influence with the KRG to change its tactics. The KRG's strategic imperative requires it to get along with Ankara, and it is in serious need of a "charm offensive" there.

In an interview with Western media released on Monday, he rejected Western criticism that he has centralized power in the Kremlin, marginalized the opposition and increased state control over the media. Asked whether he agreed with former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's description of him as an "impeccable democrat", Putin replied laughing: "Of course I am an absolute, pure democrat. But you know the problem? It's not even a problem, it's a real tragedy. The thing is that I am the only one, there just aren't any others in the world." Putin said the West's record on democracy was less than perfect. "Let's look what happens in North America -- sheer horror: torture, the homeless, Guantanamo, keeping people in custody without trial or investigation," Putin said in the interview ahead of this week's summit of the Group of Eight (G-8) industrial nations. "Look what's going on in Europe: the harsh treatment of demonstrators, the use of rubber bullets, tear gas in one capital or another, the killing of demonstrators in the streets." He also attacked post-Soviet Ukraine for "completely violating the constitution and all its laws" and heading for "complete tyranny" -- an apparent reference to the political deadlock between rival factions over the calling of fresh elections. "After the death of Mahatma Gandhi there's nobody to talk to," he concluded, referring to the Indian leader who championed civil rights and non-violent resistance to tyranny. Asked whether there was any move in Russia towards a return to totalitarian rule, Putin simply said: "That is complete rubbish, don't believe that." &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Soldiers took over two buildings and military bulldozers ripped open roads during the incursion around the town of Rafah, about two kilometres inside Palestinian territory, witnesses said. 'Armoured and infantry forces are searching the area for terrorist infrastructure. Several Palestinians have been detained for questioning,' an army spokesman told Agence France-Presse. It is the first time Israeli tanks have pushed so far into southern Gaza since the Nov 26 truce took effect, although bulldozers and armoured vehicles have carried out several small operations on the Palestinian side of the border. Israel has vowed no let-up in its action against militants since resuming air strikes in the densely populated territory on May 16 following a sharp increase in rocket fire towards southern Israel. The air raids have killed 16 civilians and 37 militants, mostly from Hamas, but have failed to completely halt the rockets. More than 285 projectiles have been fired into Israel since May 15, the army said, killing two civilians, wounding more than 20 people and sending hundreds fleeing from the southern town of Sderot, that has borne the brunt of the fire. Israel pulled out its soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005, ending an occupation that began after it captured the territory from Egypt in the June 1967 war. Copyright AFX News Limited 2007.

Hamas may be willing to agree to a ceasefire with Israel for one year, a senior official of the militant group said in an interview with an Egyptian newspaper. Hamas said it had not fired any rockets at Israel from the Gaza Strip for days. But Israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire that would include the West Bank as a ruse that would allow militants there to regroup and step up attacks. The army continued its operations against West Bank militants early yesterday, killing a gunman in the town of Jenin, hours after troops killed an unarmed Palestinian in the nearby town of Nablus, Palestinian officials said. The army said that in both cases soldiers fired at armed men. A previous Gaza truce between Hamas and Israel unraveled in the middle of last month when Hamas intensified rocket launchings into Israel, killing two Israelis. In counterstrikes on the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army has killed more than 60 Palestinians, most of them militants. Halting the bloodshed will be at the top of the agenda in a meeting next week between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Abbas, leader of the moderate Fatah Party, has been trying to press coalition partner Hamas to renew the truce. The militant group says it has not launched any rockets since Wednesday. The Islamic Jihad militant group and others took responsibility for firing at least three rockets at Israel on Saturday. No injuries were reported. Hamas deputy political leader Moussa Abu Marzouk suggested the group may be interested in ending the violence. "We may agree to a one-year ceasefire," Abu Marzouk was quoted as saying in an interview with the Egyptian daily that was published on Saturday. "Both parties have to abide by it." Abu Marzouk, who along with Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal lives in exile in Syria, demanded that Israel also agree to a truce with Hamas, saying the only way for success was calm on both sides. Several senior Hamas leaders, including Abu Marzouk, were in Cairo over the past week for talks with Egyptian officials on ways to calm fighting with Israel. A member of the Hamas political bureau, Mohammad Nazal, confirmed that Hamas is considering a truce. "Some private ideas were presented to Hamas [by Egyptian mediators] to reach a truce with Israel, and Hamas is about to undertake the suitable decision," Nazal said by telephone from Damascus. Hamas wants to get Israel to extend any Gaza ceasefire to the West Bank, where Israeli troops frequently conduct arrest raids against militants. But Israel is skeptical of Hamas' intentions. "The current ceasefire in Gaza is unfortunately a sham," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev. "It would seem that before we talk about expanding the ceasefire, we should first get it right." In the West Bank town of Jenin early yesterday, Israeli troops shot and killed a commander from a militant group made up of gunmen from Fatah and Islamic Jihad, Palestinian security officials said. The army said troops returned fire after gunmen attacked a patrol. Earlier, troops on an arrest raid in the nearby town of Nablus shot and killed a Palestinian in his shop and seriously injured another Palestinian, witnesses and rescue workers said. The army said soldiers fired at a gunman. This story has been viewed 439 times. Copyright &copy; 1999-2007 The Taipei Times. All rights reserved.

http://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/06/04/afx3783632.html&cid Melting ice accelerates global warming - UN report - Forbes.com Melting ice accelerates global warming - UN report 06.04.07, 7:22 AM ET TROMSOE, Norway (Thomson Financial) - The melting of the Earth's ice and snow is accelerating the effects of global warming and could trigger wider-ranging impacts on people, economies and wildlife, the UN warned in a report today. 'Snow and ice reflect 70 to 80 pct of the sun's energy, whereas water absorbs it. If snow and ice continue to melt, this will amplify global warming,' report author Paal Prestrud told a press conference in the Norwegian Arctic town of Tromsoe. The Global Outlook for Ice and Snow report was launched today by the United Nations Environment Programme to mark World Environment Day on June 5. It argued that an estimated 40 pct of the world's population could be affected by the loss of snow and glaciers on the mountains of Asia. Many Asian rivers begin in the Himalayas, and less ice and snow would mean less water for drinking and agriculture. In addition, rising sea levels would affect low-lying coasts and islands, hitting hard countries such as Bangladesh or Indonesia. Melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes. Rising temperatures and the thawing of permafrost, or frozen land, is triggering the expansion of existing lakes, and the emergence of new lakes and rivers in places like Siberia. 'Snow and ice are continuing to decline because of human activity. They will continue to do so if greenhouse gases continue to be emitted,' Prestrud added. Copyright AFX News Limited 2007.

The explosion that killed the four American troops occurred Sunday as the troops were conducting a cordon and search operation northwest of Baghdad, according to a statement, cited by the . Two other soldiers were killed and five were wounded along with an Iraqi interpreter in two separate roadside bombings on Sunday, the military said. In the boldest attack, a U.S. soldier died Friday after the patrol approached two suspicious men for questioning near a mosque southwest of Baghdad, and one of the suspects blew himself up. Military spokesman Maj. Webster Wright said U.S. troops also fired at the second suspect after he started acting aggressively, and the gunfire detonated his suicide vest. Seven other soldiers were killed in a series of attacks across Iraq on Saturday. Combined with the previously announced death of a U.S. soldier in central Baghdad on Friday, it was a deadly start for June. A car bomb also exploded outside a U.S. base near the city of Baqouba, leaving a number of troops gasping for air and suffering from eye irritations, the military said. The Los Angeles Times reported that the car was carrying chlorine canisters and said the soldiers who were sickened had been treated and returned to duty. On Sunday, at least 73 other Iraqis were killed or found dead nationwide, including 31 bullet-riddled bodies of men. © 2007 Al Bawaba (www.albawaba.com) Opinions - No Opinions found for this article Keep your contributions civil, tasteful and relevant.

The military court said ministers Nasseredin al-Shaer and Wasfi Qabha, plus MP Abdelrahman Zeidan, posed a "clear and present danger". The men were arrested in May during a West Bank raid in which a total of 31 Hamas officials were held. Palestinian officials criticised their continued detention. "The arrests of ministers and lawmakers are political arrests," Palestinian lawyer Osama al-Saadi told the Reuters news agency. Israel's defence minister has said that the detention of the Hamas figures could help reduce the numbers of rockets fired by militants against Israel. Earlier, Israeli forces began what was reported to be the first Gaza tank incursion for several months. Israel keeps a large tank force ready for action on Gaza's border Israel radio said tanks and troops had advanced about two kilometres into Palestinian territory in the south of the Gaza Strip. A spokesman said several Palestinians were arrested during what he called a search for terrorist infrastructure. Israel resumed air strikes on Gaza in mid-May following a sharp increase in rockets fired by Palestinian militants. The soldiers took over two buildings while military bulldozers ripped up roads around the town of Rafah, witnesses quoted by Agence France-Presse news agency said. Israeli forces pulled out of the Gaza Strip nearly two years ago. Israel had captured the Mediterranean coastal territory almost exactly 40 years ago in the 1967 war. Its forces continue to control Gaza's airspace and maritime border, and most of its land boundary. Correspondents say it is the first time Israeli tanks have pushed so deep into southern Gaza since a 26 November truce took effect.

With a degree in economics, he assumed it would be easy to find in a country with a booming economy. But the only employment available was poorly paid, short-term work that offered little security and few benefits - what the Spanish call "garbage jobs". As a result, he has spent 10 years chasing the elusive permanent work contract while working with "definite", or temporary, contracts in call centres, earning between â‚¬800 and â‚¬1,300 ($1,560, Â£883) a month. Mr Drajicevic is not alone. Non-existent before a series of labour market reforms in the 1990s, temporary and single-assignment contracts now cover more than 35 per cent of all jobs in Spain, against a European average of 12 per cent. Of the 900,000 jobs created in Spain in the year to June, two-thirds carry contracts of six months or less. The widespread use of temporary contracts has helped the country more than halve its official unemployment rate since the 1993 recession, to 9.3 per cent. It also partly explains - along with campaigns to bring the underground job market into the open - a 60 per cent increase in the number of people in work over the same period. Despite that success, Spaniards remain ambivalent about the benefits. The ability to shift from a temporary to a permanent contract appears to depend more on personal contacts than on the merit of one's work. The relative insecurity of "definite" contracts also undermines the concept of the breadwinner protecting his or her nuclear family - a cultural tenet particularly strong in Spain and in Italy - where "definite" contracts are also proliferating amid great distrust. Economists in Spain also worry that the trend towards temporary working is stifling innovation and worker mobility, and is part of the reason for Spain's poor productivity rates relative to the rest of Europe. Temporary contracts offer little, if any, training and pay as little as â‚¬4 an hour, locking a whole new class of Spaniards and immigrants into life without prospects. Some experts also argue that the job insecurity leads to a lack of enterprise among young people with university degrees. Although Spanish scientists account for 4 per cent of the world's published research, the country lags behind most of Europe in innovation league tables based on patent filing. As a whole, Spanish companies spend less than half the European average on research and development. "The precariousness of the job market means many youngsters are looking for security above all else," says Juan Carlos MartÃ­nez, an economist at the Instituto de Empresa business school in Madrid. "It frightens me to see a whole generation of youngsters aspiring to be civil servants." Large companies, in particular, are often accused of abusing temporary contracts. Contracts often run until the end of July, the start of the holiday season, and then are renewed in September, when Spaniards return to work, so that employers avoid having to pay for holidays. Employers, however, blame the costs of hiring and firing in Spain. Their share of social security contributions, as a percentage of wages, is among the highest in Europe. Employees dismissed or made redundant are often entitled to 45 days' pay for every year worked, compared with a maximum of eight in the UK. "Spain can't advance in the area of labour flexibility until we lower the costs of dismissal and social security contributions," says Sandalio Go'mez of the IESE business school in Barcelona. Under pressure by both labour unions and the corporate sector, the socialist government of Jose' Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has proposed making it easier to dismiss workers on indefinite contracts, while improving conditions for those in temporary jobs. Guillermo de la Dehesa, a leading economist, says Spain needs to find the right mix of labour flexibility and worker incentives to promote productivity. "People on fixed-term contracts need to become a little less secure to give more security to those on short-term contracts".

Putin has stepped in with a salty dismissal. From &#8216;&#8217;From whatever side you look at this problem, there&#8217;s one stupidity,'&#8217; Putin said in an interview with journalists from Group of Eight countries ahead of this week&#8217;s G-8 summit in Germany. &#8216;&#8217;If they didn&#8217;t know [about the constitutional prohibition] it&#8217;s a low level of competence and thus we have doubts about what they&#8217;re doing there,'&#8217; Putin said, according to a transcript released by the Kremlin. &#8216;&#8217;And if they knew and did this, it&#8217;s simply politics.&#8221; When Steven Lee Myers of The New York Times wrote about the case two weeks ago , he predicted that Russia would not fare well in its responses to Britain&#8217;s charges, and that the dispute would wind up &#8220;deepening the political, diplomatic and social rift between Russia and its European neighbors.&#8221; More from Mr. Myers: In proceeding after proceeding, Russiaâ€™s actions have withered under the scrutiny of international justice. As a result, the very concepts of law and justice have become touchstones for larger fears about how Mr. Putin amasses and uses power, and whether he is returning Russia to habits that brought Europe grief in the past. Even though today&#8217;s statement was unlikely to help repair the badly strained ties between Britain and Russia, the British government has decided against hurling an insult back in kind, at least in public. &#8216;&#8217;We haven&#8217;t had a formal response,'&#8217; the prime minister&#8217;s spokesman said. 14 comments so far... Once again, key your eye on the ball. It has nothing to do with this melodrama of James Bond types running amok. The west had a chance to make a partnership with Russia from nuclear weapons down to trade and commerce. But the ole boy network just could not do the right thing and has again bumped into age old Russian fears of enemies on its borders. Those fears were there before old Joe S. came into power and will be there for a long time after Putin. Now back to the Mets and Yanks where the real useless drama runs its course! â€” Posted by ed &#8220;If it looks like a duck&#8230;..&#8221; â€” Posted by Gray Fischer According to your reporter&#8217;s prior story, the Russian constitution forbids the extradition of Russian citizens. All of your stories essentially ignore this fundamental legal barrier, and thus make President Putin&#8217;s comment seem insupportable when in truth it is irrefutable. As a US citizen, I would add that our Government is currently refusing either to prosecute for terrorism or to extradite an admitted (to the Times) terrorist, Posada Carriles(presently residing comfortably in Miami), whom our own &#8220;Justice Department&#8221; has recognized as a dangerous terrorist &#8212; despite a decades-old extradition treaty with Venezuela which plainly requires the US either to try Posada Carriles or extradite him. And of course both the Administration and Congress refuse to submit US citizens to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, regardless of the factual or legal bases for criminal prosecution of our citizens. Before the Times casts another stone at Russia, I suggest an examination of the glass house we have constructed here in The Land Of The Free. â€” Posted by richard young when Bush announced thqat he liked what he saw in Putin, didn&#8217;t anybody else consider that this said more about Bush&#8217;s ways and means than the ex-KGB officer? I can certainly see what he was talking about then&#8211;neither has much use for the rule of law. â€” Posted by anne Kilgore How about Rusia to set up similar facilities in Cuba to protect US, since the US is the number one target of (interantional and domestic) terrorists and Russia is now cooperating US and west in &#8216;war against terrorism&#8217;? I often wonder how much different the wrold would be if Hitler had won the WWII. How laughable is that the neocons frequently accuse others of &#8216;cold war mentality&#8217;? â€” Posted by RC Great, both the U.S. and Russia headed by nuts. â€” Posted by joe Putin is quite correct in fearing the determination of the Bush administration to arm the Czech Republic and Poland with nuclear weapons which threaten not only Russia, Europe and much of the middle east.Neither Iran nor North Korea has demonstrated any interest in attacking Europe. This extension of our vast complex of military bases worldwide is just another manifestation of the IMPERIAL POLICIES OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. â€” Posted by Caroline Hill What has the nytimes got to do with evaluating anything. They represent their own fundamentalist faithful secular religious beliefs. What&#8217;s new? â€” Posted by R.S.Newark So will the Europeans stop funding this belligerent twit or will they continue to become more and more dependent on Russian energy exports? â€” Posted by A3K So the Russian constitution allows for the government to control the media? To harass members of dissident parties while they attempt to travel? As Yakov Smirnov would say, &#8220;What a country!&#8221; â€” Posted by A3K I wish the self-loathing, self-flagellating American commentators could keep things on point. This one is about Russia and the UK, and whether a Russian who was apparently carrying Polonium on his person should stand trial for poisoning someone to death in the UK with Polonium. If you can&#8217;t extradite, you can&#8217;t extradite. But only the unscrupulous will turn this into a wide-ranging, multi-faceted, interlocking political event. How exactly is Bush involved? â€” Posted by M I, too, agree that the focus on Russia is curious. Notice how the Bush administration recycles the language of WWII-Cold War politics. The hope is that talk about multi-million dollar missile defense systems will scare everyone into believing that what&#8217;s needed, yet again, is Cold War spending, which Putinâ€™s government may feel it needs to govern as well. Missle shield debates certainly help take voters&#8217; attention off of Iraq, Georgia, global warming, etc. The United States government cannot govern without having international crises, where looming military action must be part of the game â€“ crises give the U.S. military-industrial complex reasons to believe their goods will be needed and paid for, by whomever is in office. Thatâ€™s what Bush is doing: trying to set up the structures of the game, long-term, betting he can divide and manage Europeans, who are becoming increasingly more nationalist than internationalist. â€” Posted by Louis Anthes God bless Mr. Putin for resisting this Zionist skullduggery! â€” Posted by Michael A. Hoffman II Americans value their comfort, especially their comfort of mind&#8211;hence their tendency toward the millenarian point of view: By the time the crisis ripens, we&#8217;ll all be dead anyway. Russia&#8217;s been tucked into the comfort box for 25 years now. But whatever deep-seated paranoia persists about the two nations&#8217; motives, we should remember that Russian cities were burned to the ground and millions of its citizens murdered by Europeans. We have to go back to our own Civil War for comparable brutality and genocide. That was a long, long time ago. We&#8217;ll continue to let our leaders support a militaristic illusion of comfort&#8211;while depending on us at the same time to believe the whole world hates us. â€” Posted by peter Clarke Required (will not be published) Comments are moderated and will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

The quake shook the city of Pu'er and the surrounding area in mountainous Yunnan province in the early morning when most people were asleep, the agency said. It was followed by 55 aftershocks. Tremors were felt 200 km away to the north and south. "The dead included a four-year-old boy, who was sleeping with his mother when the earth-built walls of their house collapsed in the quake and buried him and half of the body of his mother," Xinhua said. "The mother was rescued but the boy was killed." Xinhua earlier told a Hong Kong television station a four-year-old girl was among the dead. It was not clear if the two child victims were one and the same. Power was cut to the city and the only communications possible were by mobile phone, a local official said. The quake forced the evacuation of 120,000 residents, Xinhua quoted a provincial civil affairs department official as saying. Some mostly mud-and-brick houses had collapsed and roads were destroyed, state TV said. Water and power supplies were damaged. The quake hit at 5:34 am and one Pu'er office worker named Li said it had woken her in her fifth-floor apartment. "I tried to get up but the tremor was too strong. It cracked the window panes," she told Reuters. She was called to her office, where she saw soldiers and armed police rushing down the street as rescue operations began. President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice-Premier Hui Liangyu had asked provincial government officials "to mobilise all resources available to treat the injured and minimise the loss of lives and property", Xinhua said. Coal mines in the area were ordered to suspend operations and evacuate all workers. The Pu'er city government had allocated one million yuan ($NZ175,000) for relief, Xinhua said. The provincial civil affairs department was sending 2,000 tents, 2,000 quilts and 2,000 items of clothing to the stricken area. Ning'er county, covering an area of 3,670 sq km within the city limits, has a population of 190,000. Pu'er, home of the tea of the same name, lies near to the border with Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam. The epicentre of the quake was 23.0 degrees north and 101.1 degrees east. Earthquakes are common in China. In August last year, a 5.1 magnitude quake rocked Yunnan, killing two people.

(Page 1 of 1) Use our pull-down menus to find more stories São Tomé and Príncipe Asia, Australia, and Africa Latin America and Africa Middle East and Africa U.S., Canada and Africa Enter your search terms Nigeria: Who is Behind Fatah Al-Islam in Lebanon? Posted to the web 4 June 2007 The whole world has been watching once again the carnage and mayhem which is ongoing in Tripoli, Lebanon. The fatah al-Islam is an activist group based in Nahr el Bared, Tripoli. Under their leadership Shakar el Abasi, they have waged war on the Lebanese army in the last two weeks which has displaced 25,000 people, with about 31,000 people trapped in the city. Also, they have succeeded in killing about 27 Lebanese soldiers including several Lebanese civilians. The Lebanese army is still surrounding the camp and more reinforcements have been brought in. According to the AFP, Lebanon has given the Palestinian factions until the middle of the week to negotiate a peaceful end to the fighting. Fouad Siniora also promised that the militants would be treated fairly if they surrendered or else the army will deal with the matter. The Lebanese government has been receiving support from the Druze leader, Walid Jumblatt who is strongly supporting the coalition government. According to Jumblat, there are proposals for military solution. The leader of Fatah al Islam said in a video message that his group will fight Jews, Americans and their allies. In reaction to the statement, Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abass disassociated all the Palestinian movement from Fatah al-Islam including his own Fatah organisation. So who are the Fatah al-Islam activists? The Nahr el-Bared refugee camp is one of several camps for Palestinian refugees who fled Palestine during and after the 1948 first Arab/Israeli war. This was during the formation of the state of Israel. There are other Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon but the fear is that it may have a ripple effect on other camps if it is not handled carefully. There are several theories making the round concerning the ongoing crisis. One theory is that Al Quada has penetrated the Palestinian camp in order to cause chaos within the already embattled Fuoad Siniora government. The second theory is that the Syrian government displeased with their exit after al-Hariri murder through their intelligence organisation armed and trained the fighters so as to weaken the power of the coalition government. The third theory is that the al-Hariri family funded and is behind the activists so as to use them as a protective shield. The final theory is that the Americans through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) funded and trained the Tripoli fighters for several reasons; firstly, to act as a neutralising force against Hizbollah army fighting the Israelis in Southern Lebanon. The idea is that if the Lebanese government or perhaps the UN succeeds in disarming the Fatah al Islam in Tripoli, then the disarming of the Hizbollah will be next. On the other hand, the Hizbollah are mainly Shitte supported and armed by Iran and Syria, the Tripoli fighters or the Fatah al Islam are mainly Sunnis. However, if the CIA actually has a hand in training and arming the Tripoli fighters, it has already backfired on them because they are fighting and killing Lebanese soldiers who have American support. Already Sheikh Nasra-llah, the Hizbollah leader has accused Siniora government of being weak and inept. As clever as he is, Nasrallah lent a weak support to Siniora&#39;s government by calling for the disarming and trial of those who attacked the Lebanese army. He advised against the storming of the refugee camp by the Lebanese army. Already, Nasrallah condemned the Americans for flying in relief supplies for the refugees. Once again, Lebanese civilians are caught up in the cross fire. In fact, the Lebanese government refused to grant full citizenship to the refugees so as not to alter the fragile ethnic composition of Lebanon. The refugees are not allowed to have juicy jobs and the UN relief agency have been in these refugee camps for several decades. The ripple effect of these problems is that the camp has become a breeding camp for fighters and disgruntled elements which has been penetrated by several groups such as Al Qaeda, the Americans and the Druze militia. In the end, the resolve of the Fatah al-Islam in Lebanon to fight the Israeli can no longer be realised. In Palestine, the fighting between the Hamas and Fatah is draining their energy, determination and unity to attack a dreaded enemy, Israel. If there is anybody who is benefiting from the crisis, it is Israel. Lebanon is embroiled in crisis. Lebanon has witnessed a lot of crisis such as the Israeli invasion in 1982 under the command of Ariel Sharon, the Lebanese civil war and the one month Israeli versus Hizbollah war that saw the destruction of several parts of Southern Lebanon. A lot of proxy war has been fought in Lebanon. Under the late al-Hariri, Lebanon witnessed a lot of reconstruction after the civil war. Since Syria and Iran cannot openly attack Israel, they have been arming and training the Hizbollah to fight a proxy war for them. The fragile political system in Lebanon is once again on trail. Lebanon is a melting point of Christians, Muslims and in fact both western and Middle Eastern culture and ideology. Middle East and Africa It is quite unfortunate that a crisis of this nature will rear its ugly head once again. As Americans, French, Syrians and other guerrilla movement fight to have their sway in Lebanon, the Lebanese people need peace. In fact, the region as a whole comprising Israel, Lebanon, Palestine, urgently needs peace. For peace to be achieved in the Middle East there must be comprehensive peace among the belligerents. All the armed groups in Lebanon such as Fatah al Islam, Hizbollah should understand that the only legitimate government the whole world knows is the Lebanese government.

Tuesday, June 05, 2007 Israel has plunged the Palestinians into unprecedented poverty and despair through 40 years of occupation yet failed to ensure its own security, Amnesty International said Monday. While acknowledging Israel's "legitimate security concerns," the London- based rights group said the Jewish state could not justify building a security barrier inside the West Bank and condemned its settlement policies. If Israel wanted to keep out suicide bombers, Amnesty added, it would have only built the barrier along the Green Line that marked its boundary with the West Bank until Israeli forces invaded in the June 1967 war. "Yet, the reality is that most of it is being built on Palestinian land," said Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa Program director, Malcolm Smart. The Israeli barrier defies the International Court of Justice, he said. His organization said Palestinians are also restricted by more than 500 checkpoints and blockades as well as a road network reserved for Israelis. The policies are aimed at benefiting "continuously expanding but unlawful Israeli settlements" while causing the "virtual collapse of the Palestinian economy," Amnesty charged. They are also "exacerbating the increasingly fragile conditions in which Palestinians live and work - resulting in levels of despair, poverty and food insecurity never before seen in the territories," Smart said. "Most Palestinians are now relying on aid for subsistence, with families reducing the quality and quantity of the food they consume and selling assets essential for their livelihoods." Israeli actions, Amnesty said, have "resulted in widespread human rights abuses and have also failed to bring security to the Israeli and Palestinian civilian populations." Amnesty called on Israel to lift the blockades and other restrictions and ensure its actions target specific threats rather than punish communities. It also urged Israel to stop building the barrier inside the West Bank, scrap all settlements and end its policy of demolishing Palestinian homes. Amnesty repeated calls for armed Palestinian groups to stop attacking Israeli civilians and for Palestinian authorities to prosecute those that did. It called too on the UN or another body to deploy an "international human rights monitoring mechanism" to get Israelis and Palestinians to comply with obligations under international law. Israeli and Palestinian peace groups are staging demonstrations this week to protest at 40 years of occupation following the 1967 Six Day War. The events run from today until Sunday, marking the anniversary of a war that saw Israel capture East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan, the Gaza Strip and Sinai from Egypt and Golan Heights from Syria.

Karim Khan, defence lawyer, read a letter from the ex-president who said he would not be â€œa figleaf of legitimacyâ€ for the court, claiming a lack of resources meant he only had one counsel, compared with a nine-strong prosecution team, and could not be sure of a fair trial. He added that he had â€terminated instructions to my legal representativesâ€. Fiery exchanges ensued between Mr Khan and Judge Julia Sebutinde as the lawyer tried to withdraw from the case, at one point trying to leave the court but running into a locked door. He eventually left and was replaced for the dayâ€™s proceeding. In spite of the confusion, prosecutors ploughed ahead with their opening submissions in the first case of an African leader facing an international war crimes trial. Mr Taylor, who stepped down as Liberia's president in 2003 and initially sought asylum in Nigeria, was arrested in 2006. He is charged with 11 counts of crimes against humanity, war crimes and violations of international law, including the use of child soldiers. Prosecutor Stephen Rapp said Mr Taylor backed a plan to seize effective control of Sierra Leone to exploit its natural resources, while â€œfully awareâ€ of the horrific consequences this would have on the civilian population. Mr Taylor has denied the charges. The prosecution alleges Mr Taylor, who led his own rebellion in Liberia in the 1990s, was a key player in the regional conflict, marked by mass killings, mutilations and rapes. But any hopes that the latest exercise in international justice would prove smoother than the trials of other former heads of state â€“ notably Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein â€“ were dashed amid the confusion. When the day's proceedings ended, Judge Sebutinde acknowledged Mr Taylorâ€™s complaints, saying "there has to be some equality of armsâ€ and ordered adequate facilities be provided "without further delay". The trial is being conducted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, an ad hoc tribunal established to try perpetrators of the worst atrocities committed in the country after November 1996. The trial had already been expected to adjourn for a few weeks after yesterday's opening, to allow the defence more time to prepare. That time may now be deployed in trying to sort out the defenceâ€™s problems.

"The president of the republic has decreed three days of national mourning ... During this period, flags will fly at half mast across the country," said a government statement broadcast by state media. A Togolese delegation has been sent to Freetown to enquire into the circumstances surrounding the accident, the statement added. The privately-owned Paramount Airlines helicopter exploded and caught fire while descending at Sierra Leone's main Lungi airport late on Sunday and crash-landed on the runway. Twenty passengers and two Russians, one a pilot and the other a flight engineer, were killed in the crash, while a Russian co-pilot survived, according to Paramount Airlines. Togo's Sports Minister Richard Attipoe was killed in the crash along with a group of football fans who had come out in support of Togo's national team, which beat Sierra Leone 1-0 earlier on Sunday in an African cup of Nations elimination match.

Unnoticed by the world, this brought about a version of a "single state solution" to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict -- albeit one in which Palestinians and Jews do not have equal rights. Instead, Israel has ruled the West Bank and Gaza Strip through military governments that control the daily lives of millions of Palestinians in every aspect, yet in which they have no say. Although Palestinians now elect representatives to a Palestinian Authority, these officials administer the tiny Gaza Strip, and less than 20 percent of the West Bank. Their powers scarcely exceed those of county supervisors. Meanwhile, international opinion has steadily solidified behind a "two state solution." In this scenario, independent Jewish and Palestinian states would divide the land between the Mediterranean coast and the River Jordan. By the mid-1970s, most states in the U.N. General Assembly supported Palestinian nationhood. In 1988, the PLO explicitly recognized Israel within its pre-1967 borders, agreeing to sovereignty over the West Bank and Gaza Strip, together comprising just 22 percent of former Palestine. The United States finally joined the bandwagon in 2002, when President Bush called for two democratic states living side by side in his "Roadmap to Peace." Even Israel has signed on, although its conception of what territory and powers a Palestinian state should possess is more constrictive than anyone else's. Ironically, this unanimity, so laboriously assembled over decades, upholds a solution that is now impossible to achieve. Israel's program of colonizing the West Bank has become irreversible, and the land base for a viable Palestinian state has disappeared. Some 450,000 Israeli settlers now occupy more than 140 settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. These Jewish settlements, the security swaths around them, the roads linking them to each other and to Israel, and the "separation wall" that pens Palestinians into discontiguous islands of land, cover more than 40 percent of the West Bank. Much of this is either private Palestinian property, seized without compensation, or state lands in which Palestinians hold traditional use rights that Israel refuses to respect. Meanwhile, Israel's colonizing juggernaut rolls ahead. Recently, plans to build 2,500 new homes for Israeli settlers east of Jerusalem were announced, and orders were given to continue construction of the "separation wall" in the Jordan Valley. There appears to be no political force capable of slowing, let alone halting, this movement. A comforting illusion has been fostered that if Palestinians and Israelis could only be coaxed back into negotiations, the elusive two-state solution would somehow materialize. The interests of leaders on all sides are served by this fiction, although for different reasons. For President Bush, an appearance of progress toward Palestinian-Israeli peace quells hostility toward the United States in the Middle East, and eases policy options elsewhere in the region, including Iraq. The PLO leadership, personified in the hapless Mahmoud Abbas, staked its entire political legitimacy in the Oslo accords and the endless "peace process" it inaugurated. Abandoning negotiations toward a two-state solution would constitute an admission that it had led the Palestinians into a terrible dead-end. Israel mollifies the United States by engaging in the negotiation charade, exploits the continuing indeterminacy to continue colonizing the West Bank, and advances its strategic objective of permanent control over most or all of former Palestine. Like the shimmering waters of a desert mirage, the two-state solution moves just out of reach with every apparent advancing step. The tragedy is that temporizing in the face of this inevitable truth ultimately serves neither Israeli Jews, nor Palestinian Arabs, nor Americans. Continued conflict in the region hurts the direct parties in obvious ways, and also deeply undermines the status of the United States in the Arab and Muslim worlds. Our reflexive support of Israel, even in its self-destructive policies, is a prime cause of hostility against us. The number of Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs living within the borders of former Palestine are now roughly equivalent, at just more than 5 million each. The question is: Will political power within this single political system continue to be exercised in what former ANC member and current South African Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils and others have described as an acute form of apartheid? Or will Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews enjoy equal rights and share power fairly in what is already a joint polity? For those who support peace, justice and respect for international law, the choice should be obvious.

Sporadic fighting erupted again between the army and Islamist gunmen Sunday. NAHR AL BARED, Lebanon -- The thud of shelling and the rattle of machinegun fire reverberated around a Palestinian camp in Lebanon Sunday as sporadic fighting erupted again between the army and Islamist gunmen. The clashes followed the heaviest bouts of gunbattles since the deadly standoff between besieging government forces and the Al Qaeda inspired Fatah Al Islam militia began in northern Lebanon two weeks ago. As tanks encircled the squalid Nahr Al Bared refugee camp, Prime Minister Fuad Siniora warned Saturday that the militants holed up inside must surrender or be wiped out. "This is a terrorist gang," Siniora said in an interview with Al Arabiya television. "They have to surrender themselves and their arms." He said if the Islamists give up "they will face a fair trial," but added that the army was carrying out missions against the Nahr Al Bared camp "like surgical operations in order to eradicate this phenomenon." But Fatah Al Islam, a tiny band of Sunni Muslim extremists, vowed it would fight to the last man. In all 95 people have been killed since May 20, including 42 soldiers and 41 Islamist gunmen, in the bloodiest internal fighting in Lebanon since the 1975 to 1990 civil war. Siniora said the camp's population had fallen from more than 31,000 to fewer than 3,000, including the gunmen, after civilians fled the fighting and an increasingly desperate humanitarian situation. He accused Fatah Al Islam, which he said had about 250 men, of preventing remaining civilians from leaving the camp in an apparent bid to use them as human shields. Fatah Al Islam spokesman Abu Salim Taha vowed: "We will not surrender and we will fight until the last drop of blood. "The Nahr Al Bared camp will not fall despite the destructive shelling, and the army will not be able to enter," Taha said. On Saturday, troops pounded Nahr Al Bared with 155mm artillery fire, an Agence France Presse correspondent said. Batteries of big guns on high ground targeted the northwest of Nahr Al Bared, where most of the militants were believed to be entrenched. Two helicopters also used heavy machine guns, the first time choppers have been used in the battle. An Agence France Presse photographer said the helicopters made about a dozen passes above positions manned by Fatah Al Islam, which replied with anti-tank rockets without hitting either aircraft. Sheikh Mohammed Al Hajj, a member of a delegation of Palestinian clerics attempting to broker a negotiated solution, called for a halt to the shelling. But the Islamist Hamas movement of Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniya said the "tangible progress" made by the army in clearing the camp's northern and eastern edges of militants might help mediation efforts. "This is a victory that could open the way for a political settlement," spokesman Ali Baraka said. An army spokesman said "our soldiers have cleaned up pockets of resistance around the north and east sides of the camp, and sappers have made safe buildings booby-trapped by Fatah Al Islam on the edges of the camp before they can be dislodged." A mainstream Palestinian commander inside the camp said at least eight militants had been killed Friday, but that there were no casualties among civilians, as they were sheltering in areas under his control. "Southern districts have been completely spared bombardment by the Lebanese army - that's why there have been no victims among civilians," said Abu Imad Halwani, regional commander of the Fatah movement of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Halwani said his men were building a sand barrier across the center of the camp to "prevent the Fatah Al Islam fighters from slipping in among the civilian population to escape the army siege." He also said the trapped residents, whom he numbered at 5,000, were running out of food and water. Halwani said the encircling troops have "not entered the camp, but have been besieging it from the north and the east," supporting the army's repeated insistence that its forces have remained outside Nahr Al Bared.

Police usually are quick to snuff out any memorials in Beijing for those killed in the crackdown that culminated in June 4, 1989, while China's government still calls the seven-week Tiananmen protest a counter-revolutionary riot and has yet to fully disclose what happened. But with China's human rights record under renewed scrutiny ahead of the 2008 Olympics, survivors of the bloody crackdown in Beijing marked the event's 18th anniversary on Monday by demanding political reform. And Ding, who for years was placed under house arrest during Tiananmen anniversaries and other sensitive times, wept on the eve of the anniversary as she placed a photo of her son on the spot where he died a few kilometers west of Tiananmen. "It's been 18 years and I felt like I let him down and let down the others who died with him," she said of her son, who was killed as he hid behind a flower bed from soldiers enforcing martial law on the night of June 3. He had turned 17 the day before. In Hong Kong on Monday &mdash; the only place in China where a large, public commemoration is allowed &mdash; tens of thousands gathered to mourn the dead at a candlelight vigil. In Beijing's Tiananmen Square, there were no immediate reports of protests and only tourists gathered to watch a daily flag-raising ceremony amid tight security. Ding, co-founder of the Tiananmen Mothers, a group that represents families of those who died, said police did not try to stop her Sunday night, though plainclothes agents may have been observing the vigil. "Right now, this is all I can do. Not getting justice for them, we're still pushing for it but there's been no response," said Ding, who has campaigned to get the government to acknowledge those killed in the crackdown and compensate their families. "Their spirits are obviously not at peace." Most of the surviving students who led the Tiananmen protests have drifted away from activism and into careers in business or other professions, but prominent student leader Wang Dan has continued to push for political reform in China as he pursues a doctorate in history at Harvard University. He said in a videotaped message that China's recent economic success cannot make up for the crackdown and killed hundreds, maybe thousands, of people. "Who can guarantee things that happened 18 years ago will not happen 18 years later?" Wang said. "Even if we become more powerful economically, China still cannot rise in international society." Another former student leader, Wu'er Kaixi, lamented that the memory of Tiananmen appears to be fading worldwide. "The Chinese government is unwilling to face the truth and seems to hope that the 'problem' of June 4 will simply go away," Wu'er, who has worked as a businessman and radio broadcaster in Taiwan, told The Associated Press. "For the most part, the world seems willing to go along with this." In the former British colony of Hong Kong, many residents in 1989 supported the Tiananmen protesters and the violence raised fears that the Communist leadership would not honor its promise to allow Hong Kong the civil liberties its people enjoyed under British rule. But 10 years after the hand-over, the city still enjoys freedoms that people on the mainland can only dream about. Street protests are common and the press frequently criticizes the government, though media watchdogs say self-censorship is common. A candlelight vigil Monday night filled up six soccer fields at Victoria Park near downtown Hong Kong. Amy Chan, 60, brought her 5-year-old granddaughter. "Although she is young, we need to let her know the history," Chan said. Tonny Chin, 50, a clerk, said he has attended the vigil every year since 1989. "The June fourth incident is a tragedy for China," he said. "We need to vindicate it." New York-based Human Rights Watch said Beijing's failure to account for the crackdown casts a pall on its campaign to project a new image ahead of the Olympics in 14 months. "Beijing &mdash; and by extension, the 2008 Olympic Games &mdash; will remain tarnished by this legacy until the Chinese government provides a complete and truthful account of what happened in June 1989," said Sophie Richardson, deputy Asia director of the human rights group.

Jan Grzebski, 65, was hit by a train in 1988 and was given only two years to live by doctors. But his wife Gertruda continued to care for him, and never lost hope that he would recover consciousness. Grzebski, a father of four from Dzialdowo, northern Poland, who remains confined to a wheelchair, was in his mid-40s when he slipped into the coma. Now that he has regained consciousness, however, he has observed that the dramatic transformation of the Polish economy and the invention of modern technologies such as the mobile phone appears to have done little to cheer his countrymen up. He had been living under president Wojciech Jaruzelski's regime of food shortages, and queues for petrol in a country which was almost completely cut off from the West by the Iron Curtain. "When I went into a coma there was only tea and vinegar in the shops, meat was rationed and huge petrol queues were everywhere," he told the Polish news channel TVN24. "Now I see people on the streets with cell phones and there are so many goods in the shops it makes my head spin. What amazes me is all these people who walk around with their mobile phones and never stop moaning - I've got nothing to complain about." Since he fell into his coma, Grzebski's children have all grown up, married and together have given him 11 grandchildren, whom he saw for the first time when he awoke. He told family members that he had vague memories of family gatherings with his close relatives talking to him. His most lavish praise was reserved for his wife, who had for 19 years tended his every need, turning her husband in his bed every hour to prevent sores. "It was Gertruda who saved me, and I'll never forget it," added Grzebski. Polish doctors who had been monitoring his progress agreed. Dr Boguslaw Poniatowski said: "For 19 years Mrs Grzebski did the job of an experienced intensive care team, changing her comatose husband's position every hour to prevent bed-sore infections." Gertruda said: 'I cried a lot, and I prayed a lot. Those who came to see us kept asking: 'When is he going to die?' But he's not dead."

Carla Del Ponte met government leaders and security officials, demanding the handover of five Serb suspects still at large, notably Gen. Ratko Mladic. The wartime Bosnian Serb military commander is charged with genocide in the slaughter of more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995 &#8212; the worst single atrocity in Europe since World War II. Meanwhile, Serbian war crimes prosecutors said they will exhume a a mass grave that is believed to contain up to 500 Albanian victims of the Kosovo war &#8212; more evidence of Milosevic&#039;s crackdown against Kosovo&#039;s majority in 1999 as the U.N. debates whether to grant statehood to the independence-seeking province. The exhumation will be held Tuesday at an abandoned quarry in no man&#039;s land between Serbia and Kosovo. This would be the third mass grave containing the victims of Milosevic&#039;s crackdown against independence-seeking Kosovo Albanians during the 1998-99 war there. About 800 bodies were discovered in the other two mass graves discovered since 2000 in Serbia. Del Ponte&#039;s four-day visit came days after one of Mladic&#039;s top aides during the 1992-95 Bosnian war, Gen. Zdravko Tolimir, was arrested near the Serbian-Bosnian border. Tolimir was transferred to the U.N. tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, and made an initial appearance before the court later Monday where he refused to enter a plea. G-8 quandary: Dealing with Putin How long before Bush pushes Russia back? Putin says British calls for Lugovoi extradition &#x27;stupidity&#x27; Tolimir complained that international laws were breached in his arrest and extradition, which he said took place in his "native country" of Serbia without opportunity to consult a lawyer &#8212; and not in Bosnia, as Serb authorities have contended. This was another sign that the Serbian authorities were still reluctant to arrest war crimes suspects, apparently fearing backlash from ultranationalists who consider them war heroes. Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said in a statement after meeting Del Ponte that Serbia has the "political will and determination" to capture the remaining war crimes fugitives "soonest." Del Ponte, according to the government statement, told Kostunica that the tribunal "seeks full Serbia&#039;s cooperation so that all the accused suspects find themselves in The Hague." The European Union last year suspended pre-membership talks with Serbia after Belgrade failed to meet two deadlines for Mladic to be extradited to The Hague. The suspension was a result of a negative report to the U.N. Security Council from Del Ponte about Serbia&#039;s cooperation with the tribunal, but EU officials have suggested recently that negotiations could resume. Del Ponte&#039;s next report is due in a few weeks. On Sunday the EU&#039;s enlargement commissioner, Olli Rehn, said, "On the basis of a very careful and extensive assessment ... we can start these talks in early June." Still, the actual signing of the Stabilization and Association Agreement with Serbia &#8212; a stepping stone to possible membership &#8212; is likely to take place only after Mladic is in the tribunal&#039;s custody. Serbia&#039;s government has changed since Del Ponte&#039;s last visit in October. But Kostunica, whom Del Ponte has repeatedly accused of failing to meet promises to arrest suspects, remains in office. The new Cabinet includes members of the pro-Western Democratic Party, led by President Boris Tadic, who has made it a priority to find the suspects and unblock Serbia&#039;s path to EU membership. Del Ponte&#039;s mandate as the chief U.N. war crimes prosecutor for the former Yugoslavia expires in September.

(Xinhua/Reuters Photo) BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhuanet) -- Jan Grzebski, a 65-year-old Polish railwayman who fell into a coma following an accident regained consciousness 19 years later, Polish media reported on Saturday. In 1988, Grzebski fell into a coma after sustaining head injuries as he was attaching two train carriages. Doctors also found cancer in his brain and said he would not live. Grzebski's wife Gertruda Grzebska took him home. Despite doctors' predictions, his wife never gave up hope and took care of him at home. She believed Jan would recover. For years, Gertruda fed her husband Jan carefully with a spoon and moved his body to prevent bedsores. "For 19 years he did not move or say anything," Gertruda said, "He tried to say things but it couldn't be understood. Sometimes we pretended we understood." Last October Jan fell sick with pneumonia and had to be hospitalized again, Gertruda said. Doctors' efforts led to the first signs of recovery. "He began to move and his speech was becoming clearer, although I was the only one to understand him," she said. Intensive rehabilitation brought more effects. "At the start, his speech was very unclear, now it is improving daily," said Pstragowski, who predicted his patient would soon walk. "I am sure that without the dedication of his wife, the patient would not have reached us in the (good) shape that he did." "This is my great reward for all the care, faith and love," Gertruda told media, weeping. Grzebski awoke to find his four children had all married and produced 11 grandchildren during his years in hospital.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva held talks on a wide range of bilateral, regional and global issues, including quadrupling their bilateral trade to $10 billion by 2010, civilian nuclear energy cooperation, promotion of bio-fuels, UN reforms and cooperation in multilateral forums like the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The two countries have forged strong strategic and trade ties in recent years and have a common agenda on key issues like global trade talks and expansion of the UN Security Council. The Brazilian President also urged CEOs of Indian industry to invest in biofuels, pharmaceuticals, steel, infrastructure etc. Ethanol is another area where Indian business can invest and benefit, he added. Commerce and industry ministry Kamal Nath, who was also present, said, “We have emerged as the strong voice of developing nations in trade negotiation and positive signals to business community from both sides will strengthen our relationship.” According to officials, “With both countries now being part of the trillion-dollar-economy club, the talks focused on promoting cooperation in trade and investment between the economic powerhouses.” Quadrupling bilateral trade to $10 billion by 2010 from the current $2. 41 billion a year and promoting Brazilian investment in India’s infrastructure are the thrust areas of Lula’s economic diplomacy in India.

http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/06/04/ap3783539.html&cid Iranian Weapons Found in Afghanistan - Forbes.com Iranian Weapons Found in Afghanistan 06.04.07, 5:58 AM ET Iranian weapons have begun flowing into Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday, but he and Afghan President Hamid Karzai agreed involvement by Tehran cannot yet be proved. Gates told a news conference at the presidential palace that he and Karzai had discussed the Iranian weapons issue. "There have been indications over the past few months of weapons coming in from Iran," Gates said. "We do not have any information about whether the government of Iran is supporting this, is behind it, or whether it's smuggling, or exactly what's behind it." The Iranian weapons are being supplied to the Taliban insurgents, he said, adding that some may also be headed to criminals involved in Afghanistan's drug trade. Gates did not specify what types of weapons were involved. A NATO spokesman told reporters last week that a powerful type of roadside bomb like those used in Iraq, but never before seen here, was found recently in Kabul. The bomb, known as an EFP, or explosively formed projectile, was notable for its level of sophistication. Asked separately whether he believed Tehran was behind the flow of weapons, Karzai suggested it was unlikely. "There's no reason that any of our neighbors should support the Taliban," Karzai said. "We don't have any such evidence so far" regarding possible Iranian government involvement, he said, adding that relations between the two nations were improving. "Iran and Afghanistan have never been as friendly as they are today," Karzai said. Earlier in the day, during a stop at Camp Morehead, the head of the Afghan National Army said his country is pushing the United States to accelerate training and equipping his army so the Afghans can fight the Taliban on their own. Gen. Bismullah Khan, the army chief of staff, told reporters traveling with Gates that the goal of attaining independence on the battlefield is essential. "We don't have air support," he said through an interpreter, expressing frustration at the lack of an Afghan air force. "That is a very serious problem. We are looking forward to the day when we can fight the enemy independently." He was asked how soon the army could reach that goal. "We asked for it to be as soon as possible," he said. "I will ask the secretary of defense to expedite the process so we can do this. The only way to defeat the enemy is to become independent." He mentioned that the United States has committed, with the help of allies, to building an Afghan national army of 70,000 soldiers by the end of next year. "But it's not going to be enough," he said. "We'll ask for more." Gates, making his second visit to Afghanistan as defense secretary, came to this training camp some five miles southwest of Kabul to confer with U.S. and Afghan commanders training Afghan special forces. Gates told reporters on Sunday that despite a rise in insurgent violence this spring, he remains convinced American and NATO forces are making steady progress against the Taliban. For months, Gates has expressed concern about possible reversals in Afghanistan, which still lacks a self-sustaining military and suffers from the unmet expectations of building an effective central government. On his first trip, in January, he worried about Taliban incursions from havens inside neighboring Pakistan and said it appeared the Taliban were gearing up for a spring offensive. Since then, levels of violence in Afghanistan have risen but the Taliban offensive has gained little of a foothold. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A group thought to belong to the separatist PKK drove into a police complex in the province of Tunceli, opened fire and threw a grenade. Security sources say one of the rebels was also killed. It comes amid speculation that Ankara may send troops into neighbouring northern Iraq to crush Kurdish fighters based there, despite pleas from the United States to avoid military action. The attack is the second big assault on Turkish forces in two weeks and looks set to exacerbate political and security tensions ahead of parliamentary elections in Turkey next month.

http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/Lowcaste-rioters-stone-police-in-India/2007/06/04/1180809417689.html&cid Low-caste rioters stone police in India - Breaking News - World - Breaking News Welcome to The Age. Low-caste rioters stone police in India June 4, 2007 - 6:44PM Hundreds of lower-caste Indian protesters torched buses and attacked police with rocks on Monday in New Delhi to demand greater government benefits, police and witnesses said. Members of the lower-caste Gujjar group called for a general strike in New Delhi to support their campaign in northwestern Rajasthan state, where clashes with police and a rival caste have killed at least 25 people in recent days. Although India officially banned caste discrimination decades ago, lower social groups such as the Gujjar, who are traditionally farmers and shepherds, still face widespread disadvantages. On Monday, several groups of protesters carrying sticks disrupted traffic at several places in the capital, said Rajan Bhagat, the New Delhi police spokesman. They carried placards reading "Stop atrocities against Gujjar community." Police fired tear gas and used bamboo batons to disperse nearly 500 protesters who set two state-run buses on fire and hurled rocks at police. They also blocked roads leading from New Delhi to outlying areas, witnesses and news reports said. Effigies of Vijay Raje Scindia, Rajasthan state's top elected official, were burned. Scindia has been holding talks with Gujjar leaders to end the violence. The rival lower-caste Meena group, which already receives special government treatment, is opposed to sharing employment and education benefits with the Gujjars. Clashes between both sides left four people dead Friday. Gujjars comprise 7 per cent and Meenas nearly 12 per cent of Rajasthan's 54.8 million people. Most of the violence has occurred in Dausa town in Rajasthan, including repeated attacks on government offices, railroad stations and vehicles. The protests have disrupted transport to Agra, site of the Taj Mahal, from Rajasthan's capital Jaipur. In an attempt to right historical wrongs, India's federal and state governments have over the past decades established quotas for lower caste groups to ensure they get government jobs and university spots. Gujjars are already classified as one of India's thousands of "Other Backward Classes," which gives them some preferential treatment. However, they want to be redefined as a "Scheduled Tribe," an even lower classification that would open up more opportunities.

Lawyers for the group "Mothers of Srebrenica" filed suit Monday in The Hague. The class action suit accuses the Dutch government of failing to authorize air cover to prevent the massacre - which is considered the worst genocide in Europe since the end of World War II. Serb forces slaughtered up to 8,000 Muslim men and boys after capturing the town. Dutch forces operating under a U.N. mandate were assigned to protect the enclave, which had been declared a U.N. safe zone to protect Muslims from Bosnian Serb attacks. When calls for protective airstrikes were denied, about 450 lightly-armed Dutch peacekeepers allowed Serb forces into the town and failed to prevent the Serbs from taking away the victims. Ten principal plaintiffs are each asking for $34,000 in damages. A 2002 report blamed politicians for sending Dutch U.N. troops on an impossible mission. The findings led to the resignation of the Dutch government. Last December, Srebrenica survivors expressed their outrage when the Dutch government gave medals to the peacekeepers. Earlier this year, the International Court of Justice dismissed a claim filed by Bosnia - Herzegovina against Serbia, which sought compensation for the genocide. Some information for this report was provided by AFP, AP and Reuters.

Soon after, the two sides returned to violence. That squandered moment of hope in 1993 has been the trend for 40 years since Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the Six Day War. As Palestinians and Israelis mark the anniversary Tuesday of the start of that war, a majority of both now favor two states side by side &mdash; a goal that remains frustratingly out of reach. On Sept. 13, 1993, then-President Clinton nudged Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the direction of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin after the two signed the first-ever agreement between their two peoples &mdash; a framework for peace. Rabin needed a push from his foreign minister to extend his hand to Arafat. The reluctant handshake now seems like an omen that things would not go so smoothly. After five years of largely fruitless negotiations, the peace process gave way to violence. It has been the pattern since 1967: brief high points overwhelmed in a sea of bloody Palestinian attacks and Israeli military operations and restrictions. After Israel routed Egypt and Syria and pushed the Jordanian military out of east Jerusalem and the West Bank, Israelis and Palestinians were in contrasting states of shock. Israelis by the tens of thousands streamed to Jerusalem to see and touch the holiest site in Judaism, the Western Wall, off limits to them and under Jordanian control since 1949. Others traveled to biblical sites in the West Bank. The ecstasy was so great that many talked of the coming of the Messiah. At the same time, terrified Palestinians cowered in their houses, many expecting pain and death at the hands of the Israeli military, which had just vanquished the best of the Arab war machine in less than a week. At first, Israelis did not accept that there was such a thing as a Palestinian people. Then they believed that if they treated the Palestinians well enough, they would drop the political ambitions of exiled leaders like Arafat. In June 1987, the Israeli Civil Administration, an arm of the military, put out a full-color booklet trumpeting Israel's accomplishments during its two decades in control of the West Bank and Gaza, giving the Palestinian people roads, schools, hospitals and prosperity. But Palestinians chafed under the occupation, and just five months later the situation blew up. Gaza, then the West Bank, erupted in riots. Israeli forces tried to put them down, killing demonstrators throwing rocks and firebombs. At the center of the uprising were young Palestinians who grew up under Israeli occupation and demanded its end. The violence forced Israel into negotiations with Arafat's PLO, in secret at first and then publicly, leading to that handshake on the White House lawn. Arafat made a triumphant return to Gaza in 1994, and both sides felt peace was on the way. They were wrong. Agreements were negotiated but not fully implemented. Israel pulled out of West Bank cities and refugee camps, but kept a tight hold on Palestinian life. Palestinians smuggled large quantities of weapons into their areas, preparing for more clashes. When violence erupted again in September 2000, it seemed inevitable. The last seven years have seen more than 100 Palestinian suicide bombing attacks against Israelis and intense Israeli military incursions in the West Bank and Gaza. Even Israel's unilateral pullout from Gaza in 2005 didn't stem the chaos, with the impoverished coastal strip deteriorating into anarchic world of gang wars and attacks on Israel that invite retaliation. On Sunday, Israeli tanks and infantry pushed a short distance into Gaza, detaining several Palestinians in their fight against gunmen. Years of polls show both sides want a state living in peace next to the other state, but their leaders have proved unable to overcome the historic stumbling blocks, especially control over Jerusalem and a solution for Palestinian refugees from the 1948-49 war that followed Israel's creation. Israel's grim reality is typified by extreme security &mdash; guards checking bags for bombs at the entrances to buildings, ex-generals routinely elected to positions of leadership, the military maintaining a strong influence in the country. Palestinians suffer daily. Hundreds of Israeli roadblocks stop them from moving freely in the West Bank, Gaza is often cut off from the world, their economy is stifled and their lives are dominated by the ever-present Israeli soldier, bureaucrat or roadblock. Now Israel is building a barrier along the West Bank, jutting into the territory in several places, ostensibly to stop suicide bombers from entering Israel. It's a wall that marks a border in time &mdash; hopes of peaceful coexistence in the past, a reality of violence and hatred in the present.

Football fans perish in helicopter crash June 4, 2007 - 8:46AM A helicopter carrying Togolese soccer fans to Sierra Leone's main airport has crashed, killing 21 of the 22 people on board. The Paramount Airlines helicopter, operating between Freetown and Lungi international airport, caught fire as it was descending in preparation for landing at the airport, senior airport maintenance officer Alfred Yelinkeh said. "It was shocking to see the helicopter disintegrating,'' Yelinkeh said. Most of the dead were supporters of the Togo national soccer team, including the country's sports minister who had travelled to Freetown to cheer their team, which beat Sierra Leone 1-0 in an African Cup of Nations elimination match, a local radio station reported. Togolese sports officials had apparently chartered the helicopter to catch their flight back to Togo. Paramount Airlines is one of two commercial companies that run helicopter services between Freetown and Lungi airport, ferrying passengers in a seven-minute flight over the Sierra Leone river. Helicopters and a sea ferry are the only ways to get to the airport, located across a bay from the capital, Freetown, which is on the Atlantic Ocean. A witness said the helicopter apparently developed a problem in the air and both pilots jumped out, with one of them surviving. She said the helicopter burst into flames upon crashing, and was destroyed before airport firefighters could put out the flames. In 2001, a UN helicopter travelling from UN headquarters in Sierra Leone to the airport crashed into the bay, killing all seven aboard. The UN said at the time a mechanical problem appeared to have been the cause. British Prime Minister Tony Blair paid a one-day trip to Sierra Leone, a former British colony, last week as part of a farewell tour to Africa. send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today Football fans perish in helicopter crash Place a classified ad Copyright &#169; 2007.

Putin to remain in public life after stepping down in 2008 Moscow, June 04: Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will remain active in public life even after he steps down next year, but refused to elaborate on his "ideas" about post-retirement activities. The 54-year-president said it would be "absurd to just to sit at home doing nothing" and his final choice will depend on the political setup in the country following parliamentary and presidential polls. "I have certain ideas about it, but it is too soon to talk about it," Putin told a select group of journalists ahead of the G-8 Summit in Germany's Heilingdamn. "Even under current Russian law, I am far from retirement age," he added. Under the current Constitution, the President can be elected to a maximum of two consecutive four-year terms. The prospect of Putin remaining in power for a third presidential term after 2008, when his current term expires, has been widely debated in Russia, although he himself has repeatedly said he will not run for the top post again. "I believe that the limitation by the number of terms is justified," he said, however adding, that four years is too short a term for the President of a country like Russia. "In modern Russia, five, six or seven years is quite acceptable," he said. Putin said he had been Prime Minister and acting President before elections and he knew "what was going on and what was involved in the decision-making process". "But if, for example, a Governor is elected (President), it will take him at least two years to understand national and international problems, but by then a new election campaign will have to be launched," Putin said. *Your friend's e-mail address: Liberia`s Taylor boycotts war crimes trial US troops surge in Iraq short of goal: Report Harry may be barred from Afghanistan too Bush to revive old friendships, forge new ones at G8 summit Yahoo!

Pole wakes from 19-year coma in democratic country A 65-year-old railwayman, who fell into a coma following an accident in communist Poland, regained consciousness 19 years later to find democracy and a market economy, Polish media reported on Saturday. Wheelchair-bound Jan Grzebski, whom doctors had given only two or three years to live following his 1988 accident, credited his caring wife Gertruda with his revival. "It was Gertruda that saved me, and I'll never forget it" Grzebski told news channel TVN24. "For 19 years Mrs Grzebska did the job of an experienced intensive care team, changing her comatose husband's position every hour to prevent bed-sore infections," Super Express reported Dr Boguslaw Poniatowski as saying. "When I went into a coma there was only tea and vinegar in the shops, meat was rationed and huge petrol queues were everywhere," Grzebski told TVN24, describing his recollections of the communist system's economic collapse. "Now I see people on the streets with cell phones and there are so many goods in the shops it makes my head spin." Grzebski awoke to find his four children had all married and produced 11 grandchildren during his years in the hospital. He said he vaguely recalled the family gatherings he was taken to while in a coma and his wife and children trying to communicate with him.

The long-awaited lawsuit came on the day when former Bosnian Serb Gen. Zdravko Tolimir, one of the main suspects in the killings in which up to 8,000 men and boys died, was arraigned before the U.N. war crimes tribunal but declined to enter a plea. Former Bosnian Serb Gen. Zdravko Tolimir during his initial appearance at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in The Hague, the Netherlands, Monday June 4, 2006. Tolimir, one of top war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic's top aides, is charged with genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, extermination, murder, persecution, forcible transfer and deportation. (AP Photo/Michael Kooren, Pool) (Michael Kooren - AP) The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article "The goal is not financial for the mothers and other survivors: it's about satisfaction," said lawyer Marco Gerritsen, who will represent 6,000 family members of victims in the class action lawsuit. "Unfortunately, the U.N. and the Dutch state are not willing to take their responsibility _ they do not even want to talk about it." In evidence-gathering civil hearings in 2005, a lawyer for the Dutch state argued that compensation claims should be directed at the perpetrators of the massacre: the Bosnian Serb troops under the authority of Gen. Ratko Mladic and political leader Radovan Karadzic, the U.N. tribunal's most-wanted fugitives. About 200 survivors from the group known as the Mothers of Srebrenica traveled from Bosnia to accompany lawyers as they delivered the civil summons at the Dutch Supreme Court Monday, where claims against the state must be filed. The lawsuit's chances of success are uncertain, and the degree of culpability of the U.N. and its Dutch soldiers in the massacre is fiercely debated. During the 1992-95 Bosnian war, the U.N. declared Srebrenica _ which had been besieged by Serb forces _ a U.N.-protected safe area for civilians. But around 450 Dutch soldiers on peacekeeping duty stood by helplessly as thousands of Bosnian Serb forces stormed the region in July 1995. In a chaotic and menacing situation, Dutch soldiers even assisted in separating the women from the men, who were taken away in buses by the Serb forces and murdered, their bodies buried in mass graves. An independent study by the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation cleared the Dutch troops of blame, noting they were outnumbered, lightly armed, undersupplied, and under instructions to fire only in self-defense. However, the institute's 2002 report assigned partial blame to the Dutch government for setting the troops up to fail, prompting the Cabinet of Prime Minister Wim Kok to resign. Former U.N. director-general Kofi Annan admitted "errors of judgment," regarding Srebrenica in 1999. The Dutch government has accepted "political responsibility" for the mission's failure, and gives around $20 million in aid to Bosnia annually, of which a third is reserved for projects related to rebuilding Srebrenica. Lawyer Gerritsen said that it wasn't enough for the Dutch to compensate the Bosnian government, that it must also compensate the victims personally. He said the initial filing requests $34,000 in compensation for 10 mothers of victims. Other lawyers representing survivors in the past have said $2.7 billion in compensation would be the starting point for negotiations in a settlement. The International Court of Justice earlier this year dismissed a claim filed by Bosnia against Serbia seeking compensation for the genocide at Srebrenica; Bosnian Serbs were primarily behind the massacre and links with neighboring Serbia were too tenuous, the court found. Tolimir's appearance before judges at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal was his first since he was arrested at the Bosnian border with Serbia last week after two years on the run. One of Mladic's top aides, he is charged with genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, extermination, murder, persecution, forcible transfer and deportation, as well as murder in connection with the Srebrenica massacre. Tolimir complained that international laws were not obeyed in his arrest and extradition, which he said took place in his "native country" of Serbia without opportunity to consult a lawyer. In addition he said he was filmed illegally during his arrest. "My health is very bad: I've had three attacks, strokes" and he was losing weight, he said.

BEIJING- Tens of thousands of earthquake victims in southwest China were living in tents or in the open Monday, fearful of returning to their damaged homes a day after a magnitude 6.4 quake killed three and injured at least 300. Hundreds of aftershocks sent jittery residents scurrying for safety. "We worry so much about the aftershocks. This morning we had one, and we hid anyplace we could think of," said Cai Zhongting, who was living with his family in a tent. The quake struck near China's border with Laos shortly after 5:30 a.m. Sunday, said China's official Xinhua News Agency, citing the government's seismological bureau. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake's magnitude at 6.2. The dead included a 4-year-old boy who was sleeping with his mother when the mud walls of their home collapsed, burying them, Xinhua said. The mother was later rescued. Xinhua, citing a provincial civil affairs spokesman, said 120,000 people had been forced to leave their homes. About 20,000 to 30,000 of them were living in tents, some marked "disaster relief," because the earthquake cracked walls in many buildings and made them unsafe to enter, said a man at the Ning'er County Seismological Bureau, who gave only his surname, Ma. Another official from the seismological bureau, who identified himself by his surname, Ye, said others were living without shelter because of a shortage of tents. He said more tents were being sent from other areas. Ma said the local government was providing food and water to displaced residents, although Cai said he and his family&mdash;his wife, 11-year-old daughter and three grandparents&mdash;had to scrounge for supplies themselves in hot, mosquito-infested accommodations. Some businesses opened Monday, including a branch of the Agricultural Bank of China, which was running on generators and providing food and water to six employees, including Cai, who spoke to The Associated Press from the bank. More than 300 aftershocks had been recorded by the local seismic bureau, Xinhua reported, including one with a magnitude of 5.1. Ning'er lies in a quake-prone mountainous region in Yunnan province about 90 miles north of Laos, and is famous for its strong tea, known as Pu'er. For centuries, the area sat astride an important trade route for tea and horses that ran along western China between central Asia and southeastern Asia. From 2001 to 2006, Yunnan recorded 27 earthquakes with magnitudes of at least 5.0, Xinhua said. In 1988, a magnitude 7.1 quake in Yunnan near the border with Myanmar killed more than 930 people. More than 15,000 people died after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake in the province in 1970. The Mercury News is pleased to let readers post comments about an article at the end of the article.

A privately-owned shuttle helicopter operating between Sierra Leonean capital and Lungi international airport crashed Sunday evening, killing 21 of the 22 people on board, an airport official said. FREETOWN (AFP) - Togo's sports minister and 20 other people were killed Sunday when a privately-owned shuttle helicopter they were flying in crashed at Sierra Leone's Lungi international airport, sporting and airport officials said Sunday. Sports Minister Atipe Kwako was among the 18 Togolese nationals on board the Paramount Airlines helicopter which caught fire while descending in preparation for landing at Lungi and crashed on the tarmac around 8:30 pm (2030 GMT). One of two or three Russian crew members survived the crash, and was said to be in critical condition. "It was shocking to see the helicopter disintegrating," senior airport maintenance officer Alfred Yelinkeh told AFP. Airport authorities said a total of 22 people were on board the helicopter, while sports officials said they believed only 21 were on the flight. The Paramount Airlines helicopter, owned by a Nigerian businessman, operates a seven-minutes shuttle service between the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown and the airport. Sierra Leone Football Association public relations officer Chernor Ojuku Sesay said 18 Togolese officials and supporters died in the crash, plus two of the three Russian crew members. "From what we hear, most of the victims were burnt beyond recognition," Sesay told AFP in Freetown. The victims were using the helicopter to return to the airport after attending the match in which the Togo national football team beat Sierra Leone 1-0 in an African cup of Nations elimination match. The team was in Freetown awaiting the next shuttle when the accident took place. The team and officials had chartered a jet and were due to fly back home Sunday evening. Firefighters, police and the army only succeeded in extinguished the blazing aircraft several hours after it crashed, airport workers said. "We are deeply moved over this development. We are also grieved by this tragic loss," said Nahim Khadi, president of the Sierra Leone Football Association.

At least 21 people, most of them Togolese, were killed when the Russian-made Mi-8 helicopter operated by Paramount Airlines exploded and crashed late on Sunday at Lungi international airport, 13 km (8 miles) north of Freetown. Initial reports had put the number of dead at 22, but Sierra Leone officials said the Russian pilot of the helicopter had survived. The cause of the accident was not immediately known. The Togolese sports delegation had chartered the helicopter to return to the airport after attending an African Nations Cup soccer qualifying game played in the capital Freetown on Sunday between Sierra Leone and Togo. The visiting team had won 1-0. Spokesmen for the Togolese Football Federation and the Togolese Olympic Committee confirmed Attipoe was among those killed. Togo's government Web site also reported the news. No players of the Togo national soccer team were among the victims. They had been waiting to take the next helicopter flight to Lungi airport. Paramount Airlines is one of two commercial companies that run helicopter services between Freetown and Lungi airport, ferrying passengers in a 7-minute flight over the Sierra Leone river. The alternative slower route is to use rusting river ferries or local fishing boats. Join our dating site today Guardian Unlimited &copy; Guardian News and Media Limited 2007

The decision was taken after the successful talks with state chief minister Vasundhara Raje in Jaipur. The Gujjar leaders signalled an end to the agitation, which led to the killing of 26 people in the week-long violence in the state, after the Raje made categoric assurances in the meeting. The state government has decided to set up a three-member high powered committee, headed by a retired high court judge to examine the community’s key demand. The committee will submit its report in three months, Raje announced at a joint press conference in Jaipur, with leaders of Gujjar Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti. The Samiti leaders, led by Col (retd) Kirori Singh Bainsla, regretted the violence and the loss of life during the agitation. “We regret the violence and loss of life including those of two policemen,” they said in a statement after six hours of talks. Raje said in the press conference that the committee set up, as per the provisions stipulated by the Centre, would have an expert on the issue of reservations to SCs and STs. “We have come to an understanding (with the Samiti) and found a solution through democratic means. We will try to see that justice is done to everyone,” she said, appealing to the protesters to restore calm. The chief minister also announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the next of the kin of all those killed in the violence. During the talks, state health minister Digamber Singh assisted Raje, while Bainsla was accompanied by an 11-member delegation. Bainsla said the agitation of the Gujjar community would continue peacefully if their demand for shifting the Gujjars from OBC to Scheduled Tribe category was not recommended by the state government to the Centre.

Fattah Published: June 4, 2007 Two soldiers and two militants were killed in fighting in the Palestinian refugee camp Ein al Hilweh in southern Lebanon early Monday, sparking fears that the army&#039;s 16-day siege of the Nahr al Bared camp in the north could spread further. In a series of skirmishes that began Sunday afternoon, militants with the Islamist group Jund al Sham opened fire on Lebanese Army soldiers, sparking a violent firefight that left numerous houses inside the camp ablaze and ultimately resulted in the death of the four men, military officials said. Meanwhile, 100 kilometers, or 60 miles, north at the Nahr al Bared camp, Lebanese troops continued an offensive against Fatah al Islam, putting the camp under a hail of machine gun fire and shelling from Sunday into early Monday. At least 114 people have been killed in the siege of the camp, which began when security men raided an apartment in Tripoli seeking bank robbers and touching off the fight with Fatah al Islam. The violence eased in both camps Monday afternoon as Palestinian and religious leaders sought to calm tempers in Ein al Hilweh and to negotiate an end to the siege at Nahr al Bared. Today in Africa &#038; Middle East Dreams of college destroyed in Iraq Militant video shows missing soldiers&#x27; IDs Lebanon Army keeps up siege of Palestinian camps Palestinian factions met with the army command in Sidon on Monday morning, as heavily armed Jund al Sham fighters agreed to cede their positions to militiamen from other Islamist groups at Ein al Hilweh, where more than 47,000 refugees live. Despite sporadic gunfire in Nahr al Bared, aid agencies worked to get water and food into the camp. Red Cross officials said a few civilians had managed to escape the camp. The United Nations&#039; aid agency warned that conditions inside were worsening significantly and made an appeal for new funds to help those who had fled. Thousands of refugees from the camp have escaped in the past two weeks, but aid groups estimated that about 6,000 residents are trapped inside. Reporters have been pushed back out of sight of the fighting, making it difficult to confirm reports from both sides. The Lebanese Army continued to reinforce its positions at Nahr al Bared and brought in more armor, men and supplies, possibly in preparation for another push against Fatah al Islam. A tenuous calm held through much of Monday. But an empty bus in an industrial area north of Beirut was hit by a bomb Monday night and 10 people nearby were wounded.

Sign up to receive our free Daily Briefing e-newsletter and get the top news of the day in your inbox. Breaking news E-mail alerts Get breaking news in your inbox as it happens Illegal workers linger in Israel By Laurie Copans, Associated Press PETAH TIKVA, Israel &#151; Two Palestinian men crawl through an opening not much larger than a shoe box and descend a shaky ladder, into a space filled with the rank smell of urine and cigarette smoke. This underground, unfinished mall near the junction of two Tel Aviv highways is home for dozens of Palestinian laborers who can't get scarce work permits. It's where they disappear each night, living out of sight of Israeli authorities to fill jobs offered by Israeli businesses. "When you want to work, you are not afraid of anything," said 23-year-old Abdul Jalil Hamad, who lights a candle on a concrete wall to shed light on his bed, a mattress that he found in the garbage. To avoid discovery by police, Hamad and his friends send only those with the best Hebrew and cleanest clothes to buy food at a minimarket on a back street. When the police catch him, he returns home to the West Bank with empty pockets, to face 14 family members who rely on his pay. An international aid boycott of the Palestinian government &#8212; imposed after the Islamic militants of Hamas rose to power in last year's election &#8212; has exacerbated poverty in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where about a third of the able-bodied population is out of work. The result is that across Israel at least 10,000 illegal Palestinian laborers sleep every night in shacks made from leftover building materials, or in open orchards, or in unused structures like the mall. Meals often consist of bread, humus and cheese. Some stay in buildings with running water and electricity, so they can cook and bathe in warm water. But most lack such luxuries. "They can't take showers for days and weeks, and they live in inhumane conditions," said Hanna Zohar, founder of Israel's Kav La'Oved workers hotline. "They are not criminals, but they are frightened like hunted animals." The workers risk arrest, jail sentences, expulsion and even beatings. Dozens are caught everyday by border police as they try to get to work. Palestinian economist Samir Abdullah said the Israeli restrictions have had a ripple effect, since each laborer supports an average of seven people, and the anger pushes some Palestinians to join militant groups. "Israel carries responsibility for creating this phenomenon by squeezing the Palestinian economy," he said. "They have to continue to find solutions as long as there is occupation." Israel says the Palestinian uprising that began seven years ago &#8212; including a suicide bombing campaign that killed hundreds of Israelis &#8212; left it with little choice but to restrict Palestinians' access to Israel. Jobs that Palestinians used to perform &#8212; construction, farming, cleaning &#8212; are now often filled by guest workers from Thailand, Romania, Philippines, India, China and other countries. About 55,000 Palestinians have permits to enter Israel for work, down from 120,000 in the mid-1990s, said Shlomo Dror, an Israeli army spokesman. Estimates of the number of illegal Palestinian workers in Israel range from 10,000 to 20,000 &#8212; all from the West Bank, as Gaza is surrounded by a nearly impenetrable fence. To avoid detection, Wahel Juma Asi said he spends more than half his monthly wage of $1,100 on renting an apartment and taking taxis to his job, stocking shelves at a minimarket. Still, the 22-year-old makes about four times as much in Israel as he can in the West Bank. "We come and go like thieves," Asi said. "I can't go out during the day, except to work. I duck down in the taxi so that no one sees me." Asi has been caught many times, and was once put in jail for a year, he said. Police warned him the sentence will be even longer if he is caught again, he said. A border police commander from the northern Jerusalem area, Amir Cohen, said about 400 Palestinians try to cross the security barrier illegally everyday. Of those, many turn back when they see police patrols, and about 90 are caught, he said. In a tour, Cohen showed many sections where the barrier between Israeli and Palestinian areas has not been built, or where laborers climb over the structure. He acknowledged that although suicide bombers take the same routes, the vast majority of infiltrators have nothing to do with attacks. "We know that not even 1% of these people are bombers," Cohen said. "We understand their suffering, but we have a goal and we have to carry it out as best we can." Those who are caught are usually detained or sent back to the West Bank. Eitan Diamond, a researcher at the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, said that "every worker we talked to told us that at least once they were beaten and sometimes severely." Basim Jabur, 33, said his arm was broken in one such beating. "Two border policemen came after me and started to hit me with a stick," he said. Cohen denied his officers beat workers, and police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said police investigate all accusations of violence. At the unfinished Petah Tikva mall, police cemented shut the main entrance, so only Palestinians thin enough to fit through the small hole can slip underground to sleep. Inside, a slight boy of 16 spoke as he ran his fingers around the flame of a candle. He gave his name only as Mohammed, and said he needs to support his family of eight because his father is paralyzed in both legs. He said he hadn't found work for days and had to borrow money for food. "At night when we are sleeping he talks in his sleep about his troubles," said a friend who stood next to him, giving his name as Maher. Asi, the minimarket worker, said if he's discovered and expelled he would do anything to survive. "I'll steal &#8212; or I'll go to Hamas and they will pay me," he said. "How did suicide bombers get into Hamas? Because they didn't have any money and they went crazy." Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The explosion took place at the entrance of a business center in Mar Taqla area of Sad Boushriyeh district. It also caused damages to nearby cars and at least 10 shops. Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the area, and the Lebanese security authorities set up checkpoints and cordoned off the chaotic scene. The injured, with a white band on the head, were seen leaving the scene with the help of rescuers. It was the fourth bomb attack since May 20, when a fierce conflict erupted between the Lebanese Army and the Fatah al-Islam group based at the Palestinian refugee camp of Nahr al-Bared in northern Lebanon. On May 21, a bomb planted under a car blasted near the upscale ABC shopping mall in the prosperous Christian neighborhood of Achrafye in central Beirut, killing one woman and wounding a dozen others. One day later, a car bomb rocked Beirut's Sunni neighborhood of Verdun, injuring about six persons and causing fire in a nearby building. On May 23, another bomb hit the Druze resort town of Aley, about 20 km east of Beirut, wounding about five persons. According to local Naharnet website, the blast was similar to the one that targeted two commuting busses in the mainly Christian town of Ein Alaq, 48 km northeast of Beirut on February 13, which killed and wounded at least 20 people. The Ein Alaq twin bombings were blamed by the Lebanese government on the Fatah al-Islam group.

VOA White House Correspondent Scott Stearns is traveling with the president and has this report. President Bush arrives at Prague Airport, 4 Jun 2007 Missile defense tops the agenda for the president when he meets with Czech leaders, who have agreed to host part of the missile defense system Washington wants to deploy in Eastern Europe. The deployment plan has drawn a strong response from Russian President Vladimir Putin who says it is the start of a new arms race in Europe. President Putin told reporters in Moscow that President Bush's missile plan is upsetting the world's strategic balance, and Russia will respond by targeting Russian missiles at European cities. According to a transcript released by the Kremlin, Mr. Putin said those targets could be hit with ballistic missiles or cruise missiles or what he called a "completely new system." President Putin said he believes the U.S. plan could be an effort to undermine Russia's relations with Europe. President Bush meets with President Putin during this trip on the sidelines of the G-8 summit in Germany. Mr. Bush's National Security Adviser Steve Hadley says the president will again stress that the missile defense system is no threat to Russia. "The systems we would deploy do not have capability of any significant character against Russian ICBMs destined for the - that are aimed at the United States. Just doesn't have any capability," he said. "It's a very limited capability about other states, like Iran, who are developing ballistic missiles and potentially the weapons of mass destruction that those missiles could deliver. So it's all about Iran." Iran's top security official says that is a joke. Supreme National Security Council chief Ali Larijani told Iran's state-run news agency that the country does not have missiles capable of reaching Europe. During his talks in Prague Tuesday, President Bush meets with the Czech president and prime minister to thank them for their support in Afghanistan and Iraq. He will also meet with dissidents and address a pro-democracy forum at the Czernin Palace. Later in the week the president will be in Germany for a meeting of leaders from the leading industrial countries.

Brazil has the Â´rightÂ´ to host 2014 World Cup, says Lula BRASILIA (AFP) - Brazil has the "right" to host the 2014 World Cup because of its rich footballing heritage and the fact that the last tournament held there was in 1950, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Monday. Brazil, five-time World Cup winners, are the sole candidates to host football's showpiece finals in 2014 that have long been earmarked for a South American country. "Brazil, because it has the world's best football and because it organised its last World Cup in 1950, has the right to host the World Cup," the president said in his weekly radio broadcast. Three other World Cups have been held in South America: Uruguay 1930, Chile 1962 and Argentina 1978. World footballing chiefs had clearly signalled their preference for Brazil in recent months, saying they were prepared to hold an accelerated process if only one candidate was ready to host the finals in 2014. But the Brazilian bid has faced sharp criticism at home amid warnings that the country's infrastructure is not up to scratch.

At least three people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed and 313 injured in the quake which hit the tea-producing Pu'er City and its surrounding area early on Sunday morning, when most people were in bed. Twenty-eight seriously injured people arestill receiving treatment in hospital. The area has been rocked by 1,026 aftershocks, three of which measured more than 3.0 on the Richter scale with the largest registering 5.1. Experts warn of the possibility of more aftershocks, More than 2,000 army troops and armed police have joined the rescue efforts in the quake-hit county. "The power and water supply, telecommunications and government office buildings were seriously damaged in the quake," said Kong Chuizhu, vice governor of Yunnan. Among the resettled, 65,000 were evacuated from the badly affected Ning'er County. Most of them are living in tents or public places. A total of 536,000 local residents were affected by the disaster. More than 90,000 houses collapsed and 270,000 others were damaged, incurring a direct economic loss of 2.5 billion yuan (about 327 million U.S. dollars), it said. The county has organized eight teams of 34 workers to carry out disinfection work in the worst-hit towns to prevent any epidemic, according to Yang Tianyi, director of Pu'er City. "There have been no reports of an epidemic outbreak in the region, but we face a shortage of disinfectant," Yang said Chinese President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice-Premier Hui Liangyu have asked provincial government officials in Yunnan "to mobilize all resources available to treat the injured and minimize the losses of lives and property of the public." A disaster-relief team, dispatched by the State Council, arrived in Pu'er on Sunday to direct the relief efforts. Meanwhile, another team of experts dispatched by the Ministry of Communications will arrive in Yunnan on Tuesday to help with the reconstruction of damaged roads and bridges. The Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Finance have earmarked a living subsidy of 27 million yuan (about 3.5 million dollars) for the affected people. A total of 15,000 tents have been transported to the disaster area. The most difficult aspect of the disaster relief work is the water shortage. "The tap water supply has been cut off, and the people there can only drink bottled water," said Liu Bin, a publicity official from Pu'er City. Ning'er County, covering 3,670 square kilometers, has a population of 190,000. It has reported nine quakes measuring five or above on the Richter scale in its history, with the strongest of 6.8 which happened on March 15, 1979. 179,000 evacuated after strong quake in SW China Straw-dragon performance in SW China Strong quake hits SW China

Bush's anti-ballistic missile strategy as bizarre. ..continue to more stories Eye on Iraq: Kurds in a crunch Published: June 4, 2007 at 4:15 PM UPI Senior News Analyst WASHINGTON, June 4 (UPI) -- For four years, the enthusiastically pro-American enclave of Kurdistan in Northern Iraq has been portrayed as the one shining beacon of hope in the sinister chaos of Iraq. But that bright beacon now threatens to set off a regional fire that could wreck NATO's southern flank. Bush administration policymakers and their U.S. media cheering section held out the Kurdish enclave as proof that -- with a vastly disproportionate U.S. investment in money, diplomacy and "nation-building" -- a stable, pro-American democracy could be established in the heart of the Middle East, to serve as an example to the surrounding region. They all ignored two constants of the previous 80 years of Middle East history. The first is the chaotic inability of the Kurds to get along with each other and build any kind of stable or self-sustaining state structures, a pattern that has been clear since the Treaty of Sevres in 1920. The second is the implacable hostility of giant neighboring Turkey to allowing them to do so. The one issue Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran could usually always agree on was the need to keep their Kurdish minority populations under control. Turkey has 12 million to 16 million Kurds, Iran has 4.8 million to 6.6 million and Syria has 900,000 to 2.8 million. Iraq's Kurdish regions have 4 million to 6 million Kurds. Since the U.S. armed forces with British help toppled Saddam Hussein and occupied Iraq in early April 2003, Turkish leaders have watched closely the activities of the Kurds in their northern enclave. They have especially been concerned about any Kurdish moves that threatened the status of the Turkoman community in the Kurdish-controlled, U.S.-protected areas. Now, Turkish leaders are furious over the increasing activism of the Kurdish Workers Party in southeastern Turkey. They fear that Kurdish extremists could seek to revive the ferocious guerilla/terror conflict that cost at least 40,000 lives before it was finally ended. They also accuse the United States of failing to rein in the Kurdish authorities in Northern Iraq and failing to force them to crack down on the KWP. The Kurds have reacted predictably. On Saturday, the ruler of Kurdistan, President Massoud Barzani, said flatly, "Turkey does not have the right to interfere in Kurdistan." Turkey has traditionally ranked with Israel as the United States' most loyal ally in the region. For more than half a century it has been a member of the NATO alliance and proved crucial throughout the Cold War in blocking major Soviet expansion into the Mediterranean region. But Turkey for several years has been run by an Islamist government. Its previous warm relations with Israel have cooled. But the biggest reason for the growing strains between Washington and Ankara has been the U.S. support for the independent Kurdish enclave over the past four years. The Kurds are also under attack from the Sunni insurgents who continue to wreck havoc in Iraq. The Sunnis hate them for embracing the United States and for having fought so long against Saddam's oppression. The Sunnis also resent being left impoverished while the Kurds refuse to share the oil revenues from their region with the Sunnis. In parliamentary maneuvers over the past 18 months in Baghdad, the Kurds have generally sided with the main factions of Iraq's 60 percent majority Shiites to shut out the Sunnis. And the short-term, apparent success of their exercise in self-government has been used as an argument for recognizing a de facto partition of Iraq between Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds by American advocates of the idea. But the Kurds cannot automatically rely on the Shiite political factions for support forever. Iran's influence is already very strong in Shiite movements like the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq and in the Mahdi Army led by Moqtada Sadr. Now Sadr is trying to make common cause against American forces in Iraq with Sunni insurgent and other groups. If he succeeds, the Kurds could find themselves isolated in their landlocked enclave. Even with U.S. support, it appears highly unlikely that the Kurds could maintain their de facto independence if the Shiite majority in Iraq, as well as the Sunnis, turned against them. Turkey and Iran, historic enemies, agree at least on their hostility to Kurdish independence. Turkey's grievances against the Kurds run from a desire to reclaim the oil-rich territories they lost more than 85 years ago when the British Empire unilaterally created the Kingdom of Iraq and drew its borders to include the oil-rich regions of the north, to anger over the perceived Kurdish threat to the Turkomans. But any perceived support by the Kurds for groups like the KWP that Ankara fears may revive the guerrilla war in southeastern Turkey tops everything else. White House and Pentagon policymakers have paid the Kurds relatively little attention in recent months. They have been lulled by the steady stream of success stories coming out of Kurdistan. But that dream enclave could turn into a nightmare -- and soon. &copy; Copyright 2007 United Press International, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The blast that killed the four U.S. soldiers occurred Sunday as the troops were conducting a cordon and search operation northwest of Baghdad, according to a statement. Two other soldiers were killed and five were wounded along with an Iraqi interpreter in two separate roadside bombings on Sunday, the military said. In the boldest attack, a U.S. soldier was killed Friday after the patrol approached two suspicious men for questioning near a mosque southwest of Baghdad, and one of the suspects blew himself up. Military spokesman Maj. Webster Wright said U.S. troops also fired at the second suspect after he began acting aggressively, and the gunfire detonated his suicide vest. "Our initial analysis is that these guys were al-Qaida and were planning to launch attacks into Baghdad," Wright said in an e-mailed statement. Seven other soldiers were killed in a series of attacks across Iraq on Saturday. Combined with the previously announced death of a U.S. soldier in central Baghdad on Friday, it was a deadly start for June. May was the third bloodiest month since the war began in March 2003, with 127 troop deaths reported. A car bomb also exploded outside a U.S. base near the volatile city of Baqouba, leaving a number of troops gasping for air and suffering from eye irritations, the military said. It did not confirm a report in the Los Angeles Times that the car was carrying chlorine canisters and said the soldiers who were sickened had been treated and returned to duty. The attacks came days after the Pentagon announced the completion of the troop buildup ordered by President Bush in January, raising the total number of troops in Iraq to about 150,000. That number may still climb as more support troops move in. The Bush administration has warned that the buildup will result in more U.S. casualties as more American soldiers come into contact with enemy forces and concentrate on the streets of Baghdad and remote outposts. Sectarian violence persisted against Iraqis as well, with a car parked near a police station by an open-air market exploding shortly after noon in the predominantly Shiite enclave of Balad Ruz, in volatile Diyala province of northeast of Baghdad. At least 10 people were killed. Abu Hussein, a 35-year-old elementary school teacher, said the force of the explosion knocked a bag of vegetables out of his hands. He was not injured so helped to evacuate those who were, flooding the local hospital because they were afraid to take them to facilities in nearby Baqouba, which has become an insurgent stronghold. "I went back and forth many times to the site of the explosion to transfer the wounded with my private car," he said. "I saw men and women rushing to the scene searching for their relatives and loved ones. One was crying 'my brother,' one was saying 'my father' and a woman was crying 'my husband.' It was chaos." Gunmen at a fake checkpoint in Baqouba, 35 miles north of Baghdad, also killed two passengers and wounded eight others when they opened fire on three minibuses that sought to flee from the highway trap. At least 73 other Iraqis were killed or found dead nationwide, including 31 bullet-riddled bodies of men who were apparent victims of death squads usually believed to be run by Shiite militias. Meanwhile, Mahdi Army militiamen loyal to radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr battled with Iraqi troops and local police searching for two militia leaders in the southern city of Diwaniyah as U.S. jets roared overhead. At least three people were killed and 24 wounded, Iraqi officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. The clashes in Diwaniyah erupted Saturday evening after Iraqi soldiers and police cordoned off a market in search of two senior Mahdi Army figures wanted by U.S.-led coalition forces in connection with sectarian killings. Maj. Gen. Othman Ali, commander of the Iraq army's 8th Division, said his forces captured one of the men, but he escaped when fellow militiamen came to his aid. The fighting on the east side of the city, 80 miles south of Baghdad, resumed about 9 a.m. Sunday with the support of U.S. jet fighters and helicopter gunships skimming over Diwaniyah's rooftops, police said. Ali said his forces raided two locations in "fierce" fighting that lasted three hours. They didn't find their target suspects, but did find weapons caches at the site, he said. Police and medical sources said 20 wounded Iraqis, including two policemen, were brought to the local hospital from Sunday morning's fighting. The clashes erupted anew around 1:30 p.m, and one soldier and two other people were killed, and three civilians wounded, an army officer said on condition of anonymity, since he was not authorized to speak with the media. The U.S. military had no immediate report on the action. American helicopter gunships also attacked targets in Mahdi Army-dominated Shiite east Baghdad late Saturday, killing four suspected militants and destroying 10 rockets, the U.S. military reported. The radical Shiite militia is facing growing pressure to bow to central government authority. The U.S. command said an Apache helicopter team was alerted to men setting up multiple rocket firing positions aimed at the Green Zone, home to the U.S. Embassy and Iraqi government offices. Six other suspects were captured by ground forces of the 82nd Airborne Division. A recent increase in mortar and rocket attacks on the U.S.-controlled area has raised concern, especially because they come during the U.S.-led crackdown in Baghdad. Separately, Kurdish leaders urged Turkey not to stage a military incursion into northern Iraq as it builds up its border forces amid debate about whether to attack separatist Kurdish rebels that stage raids in southeast Turkey after crossing over from hideouts in Iraq. "The Iraqi political leadership wishes to enhance relations between Iraqi and Turkish people ... and to try to avoid tension and provocation or escalate the situation," said Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd. He said a Turkish delegation was in Baghdad to discuss the situation. The leader of the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq, Massoud Barzani, said Turkish troops had shelled Kurdish areas but no incursion had occurred. "We reject any interference in Iraqi affairs and we do not accept any presence of Turkish forces on Iraqi lands," he said during a joint news conference with Talabani. "The Turkish army did not enter Iraqi territory yet but if they did, we would consult the Iraqi government and deal with it as an Iraqi issue."

They had blocked roads, burnt buses and attacked passengers. It was an atmosphere of fear created by the enaraged Gujjars and Meenas, who were out on the roads in full strength, their militant posturing visible even among their children. Dausa is the main Gujjar blockade and ground zero of the reservation clashes. But at Sikandara too at all times of the day, two to three hundred Gujjars remain gathered. They have almost formed a back-up blockade. But not all protestors are men. Many of them are just boys. They say they are the recruits of the Gujjar Tiger Force, trained for the last couple of years. They are most visible on the highway, blocking traffic. They vented their anger against the state on the Transport Corporation buses. The youngest of them are still in their teens. Since most of them are drop outs, it's unlikely that this struggle for reservation will benefit them in any way. But growing unemployment within the community has fuelled their rage. ''This is a combination of our awareness and courage, because our youth is most affected by lack of jobs,'' said Rajendra Singh Didhurhi, All India Gujjar Chetna Sangh. This almost militant posture comes naturally to these men, who once belonged to warrior clans. Half an hour away in Dausa City, there is a rival camp of the Meenas, the Meen Sena. Here again teenagers of the tribal community are up in arms, like Bhajan Lal Meenam who still studies in Class X. ''I have taken up the sword. I will not let the Gujjars take our reservations,'' said Bhajan Lal Meena, Student. The Meenas have blocked Gujjar villages like Lakhanpur, Chandaunsa, Gujjar Simla and not letting any food supplies in. ''We have taken away their medicines. We have blocked roads leading to Gujjar villages so that they starve to death,'' said a villager. At the Meena camp, the young men are being mobilized by people like Dr Swami Rameshwaraanad, who claims to be neuro surgeon. He has even created a long history to inspire the Meen Sainiks. ''The Meen Sena has been there since time immemorial,'' said Swami Rameshwaraa Nand A little ahead, some Meen Sainiks attacked NDTV's Live Broadcast van, blaming the media for only showing the plight of the Gujjars. On both sides, there was violence, rage and much militant posturing. The battle has not just dragged the men out on the roads but also the children. Young boys are fighting an adult war, without understanding the complexity of the battle. [ +Comment on the story ] Be the first to comment...

The theme of this year's series of events is "Melting Ice â€“ a Hot Topic?" VOA's Paul Sisco reports. For International Polar Year, penguins are a reminder of the lifeforms dependent upon the frozen polar regions The Earth's polar regions are frigid, forbidding environments, yet fascinating and exciting at the same time. They are also showing signs of stress. The United Nations declared 2007 the "International Polar Year" to promote research at the North and South Poles and awareness about the effects of global warming on their ice packs. To support that, the theme of this year's is "Melting Ice - A Hot Topic?" Brennan Van Dyke is with the United Nations Environment Program. "World Environmental Day is a celebration that was approved over 30 years ago by the general assembly of the United Nations, its purpose is to raise awareness about environmental issues, to encourage political attention to those issues, and to spark individual action." In an accompanying report from the United Nations, scientists estimate the Arctic is warming at twice the global rate, with sea ice retreating a little each of the last several years due mainly to global warming. The Executive Director of the U.N.'s Environment Program, Achim Steiner, says, "The latest data that we have is truly of great concern to all of us, not least because of the implications for sea level rise. Secondly, it's going to affect human beings. We need to understand how their lives, the basis of their lives are going to change fundamentally and in some cases disappear." The polar ice sheets hold about 99 percent of the world's fresh water ice. The report says the annual shrinking of the Greenland ice sheet doubled in the 1990s and continues to melt at a dramatic pace. Melting ice sheets endanger hundreds of thousands of indigenous people and as well as plant and animal species. Van Dyke says polar regions provide some of the earliest signs of climate change. "The collective actions of peoples all over the world have (a) tremendous impact on the Arctic regions. And everyone can play a role in reducing the problems of climate change. On our website, we call it WED for World Environment Day, we have the W.E.D. alphabet, 77 ways to celebrate, and it's 77 actions that an individual can take. And individual action matters, collective actions magnifies the impact and that's where the U.N. can come in."

Turkey has been building up its military forces on the Iraqi border in recent weeks, amid debate among political and military leaders about whether to attack rebels of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, who stage raids in southeast Turkey from hideouts in Iraq. Turkey's Chief of Staff Gen. Yasar Buyukanit speaks about his country's position in international security policies at an international conference in Istanbul, Thursday, May 31, 2007. Turkish military massed more troops and tanks on the border with Iraq on Thursday as Buyukanit said he was ready to stage a cross-border offensive to fight Kurdish rebels and that he had already asked approval from the government to do so. (AP Photo/Serkan Senturk) (Serkan Senturk - AP) The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article "No one should expect us to extend our necks as sheep to be slaughtered in the face of an attack aimed at destroying us," Firat news agency quoted the rebel commander, Murat Karayilan, as saying. Despite the bold rhetoric, however, analysts say the guerrillas would probably not stand and fight. Instead, they might seek safety in cave complexes or run deeper inside northern Iraq, leaving Turkey with what could turn into an open-ended and costly deployment inside Iraq. "Moving three to five kilometers (two to three miles) inside would not solve the problem," said Nihat Ali Ozcan of Turkey's Economic Policy Research Institute. "It is not easy to find even 3,000 terrorists in such difficult geography, which is full of mountain ranges, caves, hidden valleys and unknowns for Turkish soldiers." During past major incursions in the 1990s, fighting occurred on a front stretching more than 100 miles, mostly in rugged terrain where communications were difficult and the Turkish Kurds were already entrenched in the mountains. Turkey still has more than 1,000 troops deployed in northern Iraq from the last major incursion a decade ago. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki on Saturday urged Turkey not to stage a new incursion, saying his government will not allow the relatively peaceful area of northern Iraq to be turned into a battleground. "If there are some problems, we should not rely on weapons and threats, or use violence and power because this will increase tension and deepen problems," al-Maliki said at a news conference with the leader of the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq, Massoud Barzani, in the regional capital of Irbil. While the Turkish army has described the troop movements on the frontier as routine maneuvers, the military chief said Thursday that the army was ready for a cross-border offensive and was only awaiting government orders. If Turkey enters Iraq again, the military might set up a buffer zone as deep as 12 miles to try to stop rebel infiltration, a Turkish government official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Turks accuse Iraqi Kurds, who once fought alongside the Turkish soldiers against the PKK in Iraq, of supporting the separatist rebels and worry that the war in Iraq could lead to the country's disintegration and the creation of a Kurdish state in the north. Turkish intelligence reports say Iraqi Kurds are building defenses and imams of mosques in northern Iraq are calling on Iraqi Kurds to resist any Turkish incursion. Such a confrontation between two U.S. allies could raise tensions between Turkey and the U.S., which is struggling to stabilize Iraq. Turkey had expected the U.S. and Iraq to eliminate the guerrillas' safe havens in northern Iraq, but U.S. troops have not pursued the rebels. 7 Turkish Troops Killed in Rebel Attack Gates Warns Turkey Not to Invade Iraq Silva Proposes Forest Preservation Plan Landslide Damages Famed Valley in Russia CORRECTED: Insurgent video shows IDs of missing U.S. soldiers Related Topics & Web Content Top 35 Most Viewed &copy; 2007 The Associated Press Refinance Rates As Low As 2.9% - FREE QUOTES! $300,000 Mortgage for $965&frasl;mo!

The risks facing people included losing access to drinking water, and rising sea levels, the study concluded. The findings were published by the UN's Environment Programme (Unep). Unep chief Achim Steiner said the report showed that time was running out for political leaders to reach a global agreement on curbing emissions. Mr Steiner made his call for action at the launch of the UN Global Outlook for Ice and Snow report, which was being held in Tromso, Norway. Melting of snow and ice will in itself have severe consequences on nature and society "The report underlines that the fate of the world's snowy and icy places in a climatically challenged world should be cause for concern in every ministry, boardroom and living room across the world," he said. "The missing link is universal political action. Today's report should empower the public to take their leaders to task [and] should empower them to ask how much hotter it has to get before we act." The study warns of a range of threats that could destabilise ecosystems around the world, with potentially devastating consequences for hundreds of millions of people. Melting glaciers in Asia's mountains could affect an estimated 40% of the world's population, who rely on ice melt for crop irrigation and drinking water. It added that rising temperatures were already resulting in the thawing of permafrost in places such as Siberia. This was leading to the release into the atmosphere of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The fate of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, which hold almost all of the planet's freshwater ice, needed to be better understood, the UN publication urged. It said that if emissions of greenhouse gases continued unabated, the massive ice sheets were likely to become unstable as the world continued to warm. Without taking measures to mitigate sea level rise, an estimated 145 million people, primarily in Asia, would be exposed to the risk of flooding. The UN said that the International Polar Year, a 24-month global scientific study of the polar regions, would help shed light on how climate change is altering the ice dynamics in these regions. The authors also warned that less ice and snow cover was leading to more of the Sun's energy being absorbed by the land and the sea, rather than being reflected back into space. They said this "positive feedback" could accelerate global warming and result in more abrupt shifts in the climate. Norway's Environment Minister, Helen Bjoernoey, said the comprehensive study into the state of the world's snow and ice presented a bleak prognosis. "To me, it is particularly alarming to realise climate change can be a reinforcing process - global warming results in further global warming," the minister observed. "As documented in the report, melting of snow and ice will in itself have severe consequences on nature and society." E-mail this to a friend Find out how the greenhouse effect works and more...

Taylor said he had lost confidence in the United Nations-backed court for Sierra Leone. Justice Julia Sebutinde said the trial will continue and that Taylor is deemed to have waived his right to attend. "Your honours, it is with great sadness and regret that I write to inform you that I no longer feel able to participate in proceedings against me," Taylor said in a letter read by his lawyer. "At one time I had hoped and had confidence in the court&#39;s ability to dispense justice in a fair and impartial manner. At this time it has become clear that such confidence is misplaced," he said. Taylor, 59, has pleaded not guilty to the 11 counts at the Special Court for Sierra Leone. He is charged with instigating murder, rape, mutilation and the recruitment of child soldiers in the 1991-2002 civil war that left 50,000 dead. Prosecutors and human rights campaigners hope the case will send a message that nobody can expect to escape punishment for atrocities - including heads of state. Even among Africa&#39;s horrific wars, the fighting in Sierra Leone stood out for its exceptional brutality. Casual murder, mass rapes, the hacking of limbs from civilians and the press ganging of child soldiers as young as eight were commonplace.

Mr Putin said in an interview published on Monday that he intended to step down at next Marchâ€™s presidential elections and had â€œcertain thoughtsâ€ about what he would do next, but it was too early to talk about them. But he echoed suggestions from Sergei Mironov, speaker of Russiaâ€™s upper house of parliament and a Putin ally, that the presidential term should be longer, suggesting that a four-term term had been copied from American practice when Russiaâ€™s post-Soviet constitution was being drawn up. â€œSergei Mironov...has said that perhaps five or seven years would be right for Russia,â€ he said. â€œFour years, of course, is a fairly short term.â€ â€œFor todayâ€™s Russia, five, six, or seven years is quite acceptable, however, the number of terms should be limited.â€ Mr Putin added that while he had been prime minister for several months before becoming president, if someone such as a regional governor were elected president, it might take him two years to settle into the job. By then, in a four-year term, it was already time to start the next election campaign. Politicians from both houses of Russiaâ€™s parliament quickly rallied behind Mr Putinâ€™s suggestion â€“ which some analysts have suggested could provide a pretext for his early return as president. Political analysts have suggested Mr Putin could step down next March, complying with the letter of the constitution and thereby enabling him to vaunt his democratic credentials. If the constitution were then changed to lengthen the presidential term, that could provide a pretext for new elections in which Mr Putin would be constitutionally entitled to participate, analysts have said. Mr Mironov called two months ago for Mr Putin to remain as president for a third term, the most senior politician to do so. Last week, he declared the matter â€œclosedâ€ since Mr Putin had made clear he would go next year â€“ but Mr Mironov continued to voice support for lengthening the presidential term. He noted with satisfaction on Monday that Mr Putin had supported his call. Lyubov Sliska, first deputy speaker of Russiaâ€™s lower house and a leading member of the pro-Putin United Russia party, said Mr Putinâ€™s proposal was â€œrightâ€. â€œFor such a huge country as Russia, it would be realistic [for a president] to serve three terms of five years, or two terms of seven years,â€ she said. Vladimir Pligin, head of the lower houseâ€™s constitutional legislation committee, also backed the idea, but said it could only apply to the next president. â€œIn such a complex country and with such complex tasks the optimal term length for a president could be seven years,â€ he said. Alexander Ter-Avanesov, deputy head of the regional policy committee of Russiaâ€™s upper house, told Interfax news agency Mr Putinâ€™s words were in effect the beginning of the process of changing the constitution to extend the presidential term.

Glaciers from the Himalayas to the Alps are in retreat, permafrost from Alaska to Siberia is warming and snowfalls are becoming unreliable in many regions, according to a "Global Outlook for Ice and Snow" written by more than 70 experts. And it said the changes, widely blamed on greenhouse gases released by mankind's use of fossil fuels, would be felt far from polar regions or high mountain areas. "Fate of the world's snowy and icy places as a result of climate change should be cause for concern in every ministry, boardroom and living room across the world," said Achim Steiner, head of U.N. Environment Programme of the 238-page report. He said the findings were relevant "from Berlin to Brasilia, and Beijing to Boston". The report said that about 40 percent of the world's 6.5 billion population would be affected by retreating glaciers in Asia -- snow and ice in the Himalayas, for instance, help regulate river flows and irrigation from China to India. And a one metre (3 ft 3 in) rise in world sea levels, linked to expansion of the oceans as they warm and melt from glaciers, could cause almost $950 billion in damage and expose 145 million people to flooding, it said. Oceans rose by almost 20 cms last century and U.N. studies project a further rise of 18-59 cms by 2100. Asia would be hard hit by rising seas, especially low-lying Bangladesh, it said. The snow and ice report was released on the eve of World Environment Day, and two days before a June 6-8 summit by the leaders of the world's top eight industrial powers in Germany. "The world cannot afford simply to discuss climate change. It has to act," Steiner said. The report said there were big uncertainties about the fate of ice on Greenland and Antarctica, the world's main stores of fresh water. Greenland contains enough ice to raise sea levels by 7 metres, bigger Antarctica by about 60 metres. And less snow is falling in many areas, with a 1.3 percent decline per decade since the 1960s in the northern hemisphere. A one degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) temperature rise would raise the snow line in the Alps by 150 metres, for instance, damaging ski resorts and tourism. And lifestyles were already changing. Hunters in Qeqertarsuaq in western Greenland were turning to use motorboats rather than dogsleds because the sea ice was no longer solid. Polar bears are among animals under threat from shrinking ice. The report said the rise in temperatures "has not yet resulted in widespread permafrost thawing." Even so, the report said the quantity of methane being released from permafrost in Siberia may already be five times more than previously supposed. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas stored in vast quantities in permafrost. Among benefits from melting ice, a northern sea route along the coast of Russia could be open for 120 days a year by 2100 against 30 now. And the report pointed to dangers of abrupt floods linked to a melting of glaciers that have blocked lakes. In 1998 a so-called glacier lake outburst flood killed more than 100 people in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. news is provided by Zoom to full size map Nigeria files suit against Pfizer, seeks $6.95 bln INTERVIEW-Geldof raps Canada over aid pledges before G8 Insurgent video shows IDs of missing U.S. soldiers US helicopter crews in Iraq honoured for bravery Bush heads to Europe for democracy agenda, G8 InterAction Statement on President's Renewed AIDS Plan Source: InterAction - USA American Red Cross Promotes Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis Along U.S. - Mexican Border Source: American Red Cross - USA Leader of AJWS Grantee Wins Prestigious Human Rights Award Source: AJWS - USA Catholic Relief Services commends President's call to double PEPFAR funding Source: CRS - USA World Vision U.S. Welcomes President's Global AIDS Funding Proposal Source: WV - USA A man smokes at a pond filled with dead fish on the outskirts of Wuhan, central China's Hubei province, June 4, 2007.

Joseph Popiolkowski reports from Hong Kong that the anniversary has taken on new meaning in Hong Kong after a local politician downplayed the massacre. The mood was solemn at this annual vigil as the crowd swayed in song. They came to mourn and commemorate, to reflect and stage a show of unity for peace and freedom. One participant says he was honoring the memories of the dead by attending. He declined to give his name because, he says, the city "has a long memory." "The Chinese culture's still struggling to come to terms with democracy and it's a long learning process, it is good that we get to enjoy the privilege to remember the events that happened in 1989," he said. In 1989, student protesters camped out in the square for weeks demanding less corruption among China's ruling elite. But tanks rolled into the square and its surrounding streets on June 4 to crush the demonstration, killing hundreds, perhaps thousands, and provoking international condemnation. A pro-Beijing politician in Hong Kong, Ma Lik, provoked an outcry when he claimed the events in Tiananmen did not constitute a massacre. Pro-democracy activists say Ma's comments have galvanized support for their cause. Chinese protest songs Monday to mark the 18th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre" hspace=2 src="/english/images/An_organizer_in_Hong_Kong_Victoria_Park_leads_crowd_eng_195.jpg" width=195 vspace=2 border=0> An organizer in Hong Kong's Victoria Park leads the crowd in Chinese protest songs Monday to mark the 18th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre Chinese officials have long characterized the demonstration as subversive and defend the government's response as necessary to ensure public order. They have yet to release a true account of that day, including a reliable count of fatalities. Albert Ho, chairman of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, says any move toward more freedom in China hinges on the government's acceptance of its past. "And if the '89 democracy movement is not vindicated, I can hardly see how the government would have the moral conviction and commitment to future development for democracy," said Ho. This year, as in previous years, saw a clampdown on dissident voices in the mainland. Hong Kong, a former British colony, has been granted a high degree of autonomy since its return to Chinese rule in 1997. It is the only place under Chinese sovereignty where it is possible to mark the Tiananmen events.

Mike Clarke / AFP-Getty Images Hong Kong protesters at a candlelight vigil to remember the dead of Tiananmen By By George Wehrfritz June 4, 2007 - Hong Kong is again commemorating pro-democracy demonstrations that ended in bloodshed 18 years ago around Beijingâ€™s Tiananmen Square. An estimated 55,000 people attended the annual June 4 vigil at Victoria Park to remember the hundreds, if not thousands, of those killed in the student-led demonstrations and to call on the Chinese government to reverse its verdict that the 1989 protest was â€œcounter-revolutionary,â€ so that the dead can be publicly mourned. One catalyst for the scale of this yearâ€™s protest: Ma Lik, the chairman of a pro-Beijing political party called Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong and a prominent legislative councilor, who last month denied that a massacre took place and called on teachers in the city to present Tiananmen history from a â€œpatrioticâ€ perspective. Another catalyst is flamboyant Hong Kong publisher Jimmy Lai. In the wake of the Tiananmen crackdown, the self-made millionaire divested of his trendy clothing retailer Giordano and built Next Media, Hong Kongâ€™s largest listed media company. The editorial line at Laiâ€™s flagship, the Chinese-language Apple Daily, is unabashedly pro-democratic, and his China coverage pulls no punches. In recent weeks, his publications have urged readers to join this yearâ€™s remembrance. Lai spoke with NEWSWEEKâ€™s George Wehrfritz just hours before the vigil. Excerpts: NEWSWEEK: Why does Tiananmen still resonate in greater China? This year, thanks to Ma Lik, the whole controversy has been stirred up again. Until China reverses its verdict on the massacre, a lot of people will always demonstrate. Itâ€™s difficult for us to forget that our government came out and killed peaceful demonstrators. China will have to face up to what it did first. In Taiwan, the anniversary serves to remind people what kind of government mainland China has. How do you interpret what Ma Lik said? I think he was testing the water. Someone in Beijing must have asked him to see how people would react so that they could begin rewriting textbooks and set about trying to erase peopleâ€™s memories of June 4th. Ma Lik is a very cautious person, and he wouldnâ€™t have done such a thing on his own. If it was a test, what did it show? That we havenâ€™t changed. Actually, I think Ma Lik succeeded in attracting a lot more people to tonightâ€™s candlelight vigil.

Tens of thousands attended a candlelight vigil in Hong Kong - an annual event that is always well attended. Hong Kong is the only part of China's territory that is allowed to commemorate the events of Tiananmen. In Tiananmen Square itself, the day began as always with a flag-raising ceremony, watched by a small number of onlookers. Security was reportedly tight around the square, which in 1989 was the scene of weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations. On 4 June 1989, the Chinese government sent in its troops - leading to the deaths of many students and civilians. Beijing has always refused to apologise, saying the action was necessary to stop what it called a counter-revolutionary uprising.

In his first court hearing, Gen Zdravko Tolimir said he had been sent against his will to the Bosnian Serb republic, even though he is a citizen of Serbia. UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte is visiting Serbia to assess its co-operation with the court. The EU has pledged to resume talks soon on closer ties with Serbia. Tolimir, 58, did not enter a plea to charges of genocide, extermination, persecution and inhumane acts. He told the court he had suffered three strokes and lost around 30kg, and said that he was unlawfully extradited to the Bosnian Serb republic (Republika Srpska). Carla Del Ponte is dealing with a new Serbian government "I was arrested in the territory of Serbia, whose citizen I am, and I was transferred to the territory of [Republika Srpska] ... without the presence of a lawyer," Gen Tolimir said. He was reportedly arrested following a tip-off from Serbian police after spending years on the run. He was a top aide to Gen Ratko Mladic, the most-wanted former Bosnian Serb commander, who is still on the run. His arrest reduced to five the number of indicted war crimes suspects still at large. He is accused of involvement in the Srebrenica massacre of up to 8,000 Muslim men and boys in eastern Bosnia in 1995. Ms Del Ponte's visit was requested by the new Serbian government, which wants her to assess its co-operation with the court. She has repeatedly urged Belgrade to capture Gen Mladic. The European Union suspended talks with Serbia a year ago because of Belgrade's failure to co-operate with the court. The resumption date will depend on Ms Del Ponte's assessment. EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn has said he expects the talks to resume later this month.

Rising temperatures are shrinking snow cover, sea ice, glaciers, permafrost and lake ice in areas from Greenland to Antarctica and the Himalayas, according to the report, published today in connection with World Environment Day. These changes are likely to accelerate if greenhouse gases thought to cause global warming aren&#39;t reduced, the study showed. ``Today&#39;s report should empower the public to take their leaders to task, should encourage them to ask how much hotter it has to get before we act on a fair and forward-looking emissions reduction deal in Bali this December,&#39;&#39; Achim Steiner, head of the UN Environmental Program, said in a Webcast speech in Tromsoe, Norway, which is hosting World Environment Day. Delegates meeting in Bali will seek to extend the Kyoto Protocol, the main global treaty for cutting emissions of greenhouse gases, which expires in 2012. U.S. President George W. Bush, who has rejected Kyoto, last week urged 15 of the world&#39;s biggest polluting nations to agree on a global emissions reduction goal by the end of next year. The extent of sea ice in both polar regions is expected to decline by a quarter by 2100, when the Arctic is set to be largely ice-free in the summer, the UN report said. Ice in Arctic waters has retreated by as much as 7 percent in the winter and 12 percent in the summer over the past 30 years. For the almost 4 million people in the region, including Nobel Peace Prize nominee Sheila Watt-Cloutier, the heat is already on. ``The ice is freezing much later in the fall and breaking up much earlier in the spring, leaving less time for us to hunt because winters are our longest season,&#39;&#39; Watt-Cloutier, a spokeswoman for the 150,000 Arctic Inuit people, said in a May 11 interview. Diminishing sea ice is forcing some coastal Arctic towns, such as Shishmaref, Alaska, to relocate, said Watt-Cloutier, who lives on Canada&#39;s Baffin Island. Without ice as a buffer, waves cause coastal erosion. Warmer temperatures have increased winter rainfall, causing snow to melt and refreeze into ice that is too hard for animals to dig through for food. The survival of caribou, reindeer and polar bears is at risk, the study said. Some reindeer are becoming thinner, said Ole Henrik Magga, a part-time herder and professor at the Sami University College in Kautokeino, Norway. ``After a while, a layer of ice may cover the Arctic, and this would have catastrophic effects on all animals who have to dig through snow for food,&#39;&#39; Magga said in a May 25 interview. ``The other worst-case scenario is that the snow may have melted away over the next 50 to 100 years over large parts of the Arctic, changing the basis of life for reindeer and other animals.&#39;&#39; Every 1-degree rise in temperature will move the snow line in mountains in Chile up by 120 meters (394 feet) and by 150 meters in the Alps, potentially hurting tourism and industries that cater to winter sports, the report predicted. Glaciers in mountain ranges including Himalayas-Hindu Kush, Kunlun Shan, Pamir and Tien Shanan may shrink by between 40 percent and 80 percent by 2100, the UN study showed. This could affect water supplies for as many as 2.4 billion people in Asia, or 40 percent of the world&#39;s population, it said. ``The threat to the climate is so important that if it isn&#39;t solved, it could lead to huge conflicts as people fight over access to water and land,&#39;&#39; said Norwegian member of parliament Heidi Soerensen, who nominated Watt-Cloutier and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore for this year&#39;s Nobel peace prize for raising awareness about climate change. A 1-meter sea level increase would expose about 145 million people to flooding and may cost almost $950 billion in damage to communities and industries, the report said. Small islands and populations in large river deltas, such as the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta in Bangladesh, are at risk. A total meltdown of Greenland&#39;s ice sheets would raise sea levels by an estimated 7 meters, the study showed. ``We can state with confidence that sea level rise is increasing, but we lack the ability to predict how much the ice sheets will in the end contribute to this over the next 10 years, let alone the next 50 years,&#39;&#39; said Paal Prestud of the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo. Lakes formed by the melting of frozen land in places such as Siberia are emitting bubbles of methane that may be up to 43,000 years old, adding to the effect of global warming caused by other greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, the UN said. ``Because we are on the land and the ice and the snow every day, we&#39;re witnessing all of these changes very fast,&#39;&#39; said Watt-Cloutier, who traveled by dog sled in her childhood. ``We are telling the world that this is an early warning for you.&#39;&#39; To contact the reporter on this story: Bunny Nooryani in Oslo at Last Updated: June 4, 2007 08:00 EDT Brazil Stock Market Surpasses $1 Trillion as Metals Rally Drives Profit Emerging-Market Bond Spreads Widen as Chinese Stocks Tumble Curbs Demand Arcelor Mittal Buys Minority Stakes in Brazil Unit for 10.3 Billion Reais

VOA Correspondent Alisha Ryu in our East Africa Bureau in Nairobi reports the youth group is believed to have carried out several other attacks against high-level government officials in recent weeks. In a statement posted on a website used by al-Qaida and other Muslim militants, a group calling itself the Mujahideen Youth Movement identified the suicide bomber as Abdul-Aziz Mohammad Semter and said that he had carried out a "heroic martyrdom operation against an apostate prime minister." Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi looks at his destroyed house, 04 June 2007 On Sunday, the bomber drove up to Prime Minister Gedi's heavily guarded compound in northern Mogadishu and rammed his explosives-packed vehicle into a wall. The prime minister, who was home at the time, was not hurt, but the ensuing blast killed five guards and two civilians. The spokesman for the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia, Captain Paddy Ankunda, says the Somali leader, who survived another assassination attempt just two and a half weeks ago in the capital, has been moved to another location in the city. "I can confirm that he is well. He is safe and he is unhurt," he said. "He is now in the hands of government security forces." The Mujahideen Youth Movement is believed to be an off-shoot of the Shabbab, an extremist group that once boasted several thousand members. The Shabbab was founded about three years ago by the radical former military chief of the Islamic Courts Union, Adan Hashi Ayro. He is wanted by the United States for harboring al-Qaida operatives, who carried out the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in East Africa. Ayro, who was trained by al-Qaida in Afghanistan, fled Mogadishu in late December with other Islamist leaders, as Ethiopian and Somali troops closed in on the capital. After the Islamists' defeat, the Shabbab disbanded and many of its members melted back into society. But Somalia observer Richard Cornwell at the Institute for Strategic Studies in South Africa says elements of the Shabbab have regrouped in recent months and are trying to extend their reach beyond Mogadishu. "The Shabbab has splintered into cellular-like groups and is moving throughout Somalia, trying to influence local politics," said Cornwell. "I understand some technicians, who show them how to do remotely-detonated explosions, and some materials, like bombing vests, have been arriving there. I even understand that 300 of these guys have gone up into the Ogaden region in Ethiopia." It is not clear who has assumed leadership of the Mujahideen Youth Movement. It is equally unclear who is providing assistance to the group. In the past month, the Mujahideen Youth Movement has taken responsibility for several Iraq-style guerrilla attacks, including roadside bombings against high-ranking Somali officials and the Ethiopian troops protecting them.

Hamas spokesman, Fawzi Barhoum said here Sunday that "we can not sit and see a furious situation in West Bank, while we are in peace in Gaza". "Palestine includes all people from Gaza and West Bank," Hamas member said. In this regard the Palestinian minister of information, Mostafa al-Barghuthi told Alalam TV that Israeli escalated military attack to Palestinian lands especially in Nablus is a "very dangerous act". He also condemned Israel militants' reaction to Palestinian protester's demonstration against the "separation wall" adding that "all these aggressions are signs indicating that Palestinian self authority president; Mahmoud Abbas meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is going to be fruitless". In 2002 Israel began construction of the separation wall. At July 2006, 362 km length were completed and another 88 km under construction. Another 253 km are planned, mainly deep fingers into the West Bank.

Bush is trying to redeem his Presidency and the tattered American reputation in the wake of the disastrous war in Iraq, but it is not clear whether he is serious and sincere. After steadfastly refusing to heed the warning signals over the deepening crisis of climate change for the greater part of his two Presidential terms, he now wants to emerge as the champion of the green cause. The Bush rethinking on the issue is quite similar to that on the war in Iraq. In 2003, President Bush was contemptuous of the United Nations, and he did not think that UN mandate was necessary to go ahead with the war. But after two years, the US went back to the UN and sought a mandate to handle the unsettled situation in Iraq. Similarly, the Americans now realise that they have been marginalised on the most important issue facing the international community. But instead of being penitent, they want to pretend that they will lead the world in grappling with the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and the consequential climate change. What is more, the US wants to take along other countries, including India and China, in this latest initiative. In 1997, the US had refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol which set the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020. Its simplistic argument was that the US cannot afford to place its economic growth in jeopardy, though the European Union (EU), which is the strongest advocate of Kyoto Protocol, had argued that economic growth and environment-friendly measures are not incompatible. Of course, the US has not changed its position on Kyoto Protocol goals. Instead, Bush is offering to spend money on research and development to create cleaner technologies and to set long-term goals to meet the challenge of climate change. He continues to skirt the Kyoto Protocol, but is also trying at the same time to keep the US in the picture with regard to future initiatives on environmental issues. The Kyoto Protocol ends in 2012, and it is time for a fresh round of talks, a new agenda and new goals. Bush wants to take the US back into the international community’s green initiatives, though in the American way. It is true that without the Americans on board, no plan to combat climate change will be effective because American lifestyles generate the most pollution. Therefore, it will be necessary for EU and others to humour the US so that it can join the collective effort.

Ethiopian and Somali forces killed three civilians and wounded five others after a failed hand grenade attack, and police killed two civilians after two police officers were shot dead, witnesses said. Meanwhile an Islamist website posted pictures of a man who allegedly carried out the suicide attack on the prime minister. The grenade attack was the second failed strike today on Ethiopian-Somali troops in the northern district of Huriwa. 'Immediately after the grenade was thrown at the Ethiopian-Somali convoy, they opened heavy fire in the direction it came from,' witness Ahmed Ismail told Agence France-Presse. Government and United Nations officials, African Union peacekeeping troops and Ethiopian soldiers have been targeted in a growing number of Iraq-style homemade bomb and suicide attacks, mainly in the capital. Prime Minister Gedi, whose interim government is struggling to control the anarchic Horn of Africa nation, blamed the attack on Al-Qaeda. 'The terrorists are still hiding in the country, particularly in Mogadishu, to carry out violent actions like this. We will crack down on them and we will no longer give them a chance to hide in the community,' Gedi told journalists at his compound today. The attacks followed a deadly weekend assault in northeastern Somalia by security forces and a US warship against Islamist extremists with suspected links to Al-Qaeda.

Secretary Gates was in Afghanistan for an unannounced one-day visit. From Islamabad, VOA correspondent Benjamin Sand reports. Afghan President Hamid Karzai (r) speaks during a joint press conference with U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates at the Presidential Palace in Kabul, 04 Jun 2007 Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters in Kabul Monday that Iranian weapons are being supplied to Taleban insurgents and Afghanistan's powerful illegal drug cartels. But he added that there is no evidence the Iranian government is behind the weapons trade. "There have been indications over the past few months of weapons coming in from Iran," he said. "We do not have any information about whether the government of Iran is supporting this, is behind it, or whether it's smuggling or exactly what's behind it." Gates did not indicate what types of weapons have been flowing into Afghanistan from Iran. Washington has repeatedly accused Iran of supporting anti-American insurgents in Iraq. Until recently Tehran was rarely, if ever, linked to the violence in Afghanistan. The two countries share a long and largely unprotected border with countless roads and trails crisscrossing the rugged terrain. Afghan President Hamid Karzai insisted Monday he thought it unlikely the Iranian government was behind the recent influx of weapons. "We don't have any such evidence so far. We have a very good relationship with the Iranian government," he said. "Iran and Afghanistan have never been as friendly as they are today." Gate's one-day visit focused primarily on military coordination between the United States and its allies in the region more than five years after U.S.-led forces ousted the hardline Taleban regime in 2001. There are currently around 50,000 U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan. The Secretary said he remains confident the U.S.-led coalition will defeat the Taleban insurgency. Nevertheless, militant activity has increased throughout much of the country in recent weeks, including a sharp rise in suicide and roadside bomb attacks. Earlier in the day Afghanistan's military chief of staff, General Bismullah Khan said an independent and self-sustaining Afghan army would be a key to victory. He said that with Washington's support the national army should have more than 70,000 soldiers by the end of next year but added even that might not be enough. He said he hoped the United States would accelerate its training programs for new Afghan soldiers so the army could ultimately face the enemy without any outside support. Secretary Gates has taken the lead in pressing Washington's NATO allies to contribute an additional 3,000 troops to help expand training operations in Afghanistan.

The explosion occurred in the residential and industrial Bouchrieh suburb, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. The bus was parked near a shopping plaza and a church in the area, witnesses said. Fire engines and ambulances raced to the scene of the explosion, which wrecked the bus as well as some 20 cars in the vicinity. The wounded were seen being carried away on stretchers by Red Cross workers. Police officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said most of the injuries were light.

On his second visit to Afghanistan since taking over the Pentagon in December, Gates met Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who also said there was no evidence Iran supplied the Taliban. "There have been indications over the past few months (that) weapons are coming in from Iran," Gates told a news conference with Karzai at the national palace in Kabul. "We do not have any information about whether the government of Iran is supporting this, is behind it, or whether it is smuggling, or exactly what is behind it." "But there clearly is evidence that some weapons are coming into Afghanistan destined for the Taliban, but perhaps also for criminal elements involved in the drug trafficking coming from Iran," he added. U.S. officials accuse Iran of meddling in Afghanistan, and the Pentagon's top general said on Sunday that Iranian-made weapons had been found inside Afghanistan. Gates' one-day visit to Afghanistan was aimed at assessing coordination within the U.S.-led coalition to ensure Afghanistan does not spiral into the kind of violence seen in Iraq. He met Karzai and commanders in Afghanistan and viewed a commando training facility for Afghan soldiers. The former CIA director told Afghan officers during the visit that he remembered aiding anti-Soviet Afghan fighters in the area in the 1980s. Gates then made his first visit to Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, host to some of the worst violence in Afghanistan, to meet U.S. troops and a regional commander behind closed doors. Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium and supplies about 90 percent of the world's heroin. Authorities say heroin profits help fund the Taliban, waging an insurgency since they were ousted from government by a U.S.-led invasion in 2001. Taliban violence has picked up in recent weeks following a traditional winter lull in fighting, despite the presence of nearly 50,000 NATO and U.S.-led coalition troops in Afghanistan. Taliban suicide bombers strike several times a week and have recently moved into relatively peaceful areas in the north. The Taliban says it has trained hundreds of suicide bombers. But Gates said the Taliban's expected spring offensive had not been as strong as some U.S. and NATO officials expected. "I believe based on everything I've seen and everything I've heard, the spring offensive has been an Afghan-alliance offensive that has put the Taliban off their game," Gates said. "The key is to sustain that." "I am confident that the United States and our partners in the alliance will be here for as long as it takes," he said. Karzai said Afghanistan's relationship with Iran had never been better, despite growing U.S.-Iranian tensions. "We don't have any such evidence so far of the involvement of the Iranian government in supplying the Taliban," Karzai said. In contrast, Afghan National Army chief Bismillah Khan said earlier in the day that Afghanistan was not getting enough cooperation from neighbouring Pakistan. "We have a relationship, of course, under the coordination of the United States," Khan said as he and Gates toured the commando training centre on the outskirts of Kabul. "The cooperation that we need, unfortunately, we don't get." Khan said the two countries needed a better exchange of information and more joint training exercises. Relations between the uneasy neighbours, both U.S. allies in its war on terrorism, have deteriorated in recent months. The worst violence in years erupted three weeks ago in a disputed border area in Afghanistan's southern Paktia province. Afghanistan said Pakistan invaded its soil and killed 13 Afghans. Pakistan said Afghan troops started unprovoked firing on border posts.

But a Hamas spokesman said the Islamist group's agenda was separate from the government's and the plan fell short of conditions the movement has set for a truce. "The government conducted an in-depth and lengthy discussion of the proposal offered by Abbas. The government has expressed its support for a reciprocal, comprehensive and simultaneous calm," cabinet spokesman Ghazi Hamad said. Abbas proposed last week that Hamas and other militant groups halt rocket launchings from Gaza and Israel stop air strikes against them. According to the plan, the ceasefire would be extended to the occupied West Bank within a month. The Hamas spokesman, Fawzi Barhoum, said the group was sticking to its demand that a truce go into effect simultaneously in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. "It is neither logical nor acceptable that we leave the fate of our people in the West Bank hostage to the intentions of the occupation," Barhoum said, referring to Israel. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has rebuffed Abbas's plan, saying on Sunday that Israel's air strikes and limited ground operations against militants in the Gaza Strip had led to a drop in rocket attacks from the territory and they would continue. Israel has rejected the idea of a West Bank truce, saying its frequent raids to detain militants were necessary to stop attacks on Israelis. Israel has said Hamas would use a lull to rearm. Hamas and other militant groups have fired some 285 rockets from Gaza, killing two Israelis, since a surge of violence began on May 15, the Israeli military said. Israeli air strikes have killed nearly 50 Palestinians, most of them fighters. Israel has also carried out limited ground operations in the Gaza Strip. news is provided by Zoom to full size map Facts & Figures - Human development index ranking (2004) WITNESS-40 years on, slow road across occupied West Bank Gunmen kill 2 soldiers at south Lebanon camp Bomb explodes in east Beirut, seven wounded Palestinian government backs Abbas ceasefire plan Explosion heard in east Beirut - witnesses Gaza and West Bank &#8211; ICRC Bulletin No. 20 / 2007 Source: ICRC - Switzerland Gaza and West Bank &#8211; ICRC Bulletin No. 20 / 2007 Source: ICRC - Switzerland Displaced Palestinians receive First World Vision relief Source: WV MEERO - Cyprus Thousands of Palestinian refugees flee fighting in northern Lebanon Source: Christian Aid - UK Toll on Palestinian children feared in Lebanon refugee camp Source: WV MEERO - Cyprus An Israeli soldier inspects a Palestinian man at a checkpoint in the West Bank city of Hebron in this December 4, 2006 file photo.

Man wakes from 19-year coma to 'prettier' Poland Railway worker is shocked at radical changes "He was so amazed to see the colorful streets," said Gertruda Grzebska, with her husband, Jan Grzebski , in Warsaw. (Kacper Pempel/Reuters) By Monika Scislowska, Associated Press | WARSAW, Poland -- A railway worker who emerged from a 19-year coma woke to a radically altered Poland and thinks "the world is prettier now" than it was under communism, his wife said yesterday. Gertruda Grzebska, 63, said that for years she fed her husband Jan carefully with a spoon and moved his body to prevent bedsores. "For 19 years he did not move or say anything," Grzebska said by phone. "He tried to say things, but it couldn't be understood. Sometimes we pretended we understood." "Now he spends his days sitting in a wheelchair, and last weekend we took him out for a walk in his wheelchair," she said. "He was so amazed to see the colorful streets, the goods," she said. "He says the world is prettier now" than it was 19 years ago, when Poland was still under communist rule. "I could not talk or do anything, now it's much better," Jan Grzebski , 65, told in TVN24 Television in a weak but clear voice, lying in bed at his home in the northern city of Dzialdowo. "I wake up at 7 a.m. and I watch TV," he said, smiling slightly. Wojciech Pstragowski, a rehabilitation specialist, said Grzebski was shocked at the changes in Poland -- especially its stores: "He remembered shelves filled with mustard and vinegar only" under communism. Poland shed communism in 1989 and has developed democracy and a market economy. Despite doctors' predictions that he would not live, his wife never gave up hope and took care of him at home. "I would fly into a rage every time someone would say that people like him should be euthanized, so they don't suffer," she told local daily Gazeta Dzialdowska. "I believed Janek would recover," she said, using an affectionate version of his name. "This is my great reward for all the care, faith and love," she said, weeping. "He remembers everything that was going on around him," she said. "He talks about it and remembers the weddings of our children. He had fever around the time of the weddings, so he knew something big was taking place." In 1988, when Poland was still run by a communist government, Grzebski fell into a coma after sustaining head injuries as he was attaching two train carriages. Doctors also found cancer in his brain and said he would not live. Grzebski's wife took him home. Last October he fell sick with pneumonia and had to be hospitalized again, Grzebska said. Doctors' efforts led to the first signs of recovery. "He began to move and his speech was becoming clearer, although I was the only one to understand him," she said. Intensive rehabilitation brought more effects. "At the start, his speech was very unclear, now it is improving daily," said Pstragowski, who predicted his patient would soon walk. "I am sure that without the dedication of his wife, the patient would not have reached us in the [good] shape that he did." &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

To my surprise, it wasn't about the stalemate in the peace process or the Arab peace initiative. It was about the conflict between Palestinian organizations in Gaza -- Hamas vs. Fatah -- and whether Gaza was in fact already lost to the Islamists. Both Israelis and Palestinians were wondering about the consequences of Gaza's becoming, in their word, "Hamastan." Not all felt Gaza was lost. Some said Israel should let weapons and ammunition get to Fatah forces in Gaza to battle Hamas. I also heard from Palestinians and Israelis alike that Egypt could do much more to prevent Hamas from receiving smuggled arms and money through the Sinai tunnels running into Gaza. A pair of rockets are launched toward Israel from northern Gaza last month. (By Emilio Morenatti -- Associated Press) Save & Share Article But for every Palestinian and Israeli who argued for arming Fatah, I heard a contrary point of view that at this point it might not make any difference. The consensus was that Hamas had made a deliberate calculation to attack all key security positions held by Fatah in Gaza and that the Fatah forces now had few, if any, senior commanders still in that area. All those I spoke with were worried about the consequences of Gaza's becoming an Islamist enclave. They saw it offering inspiration to other Islamists throughout the Middle East and providing a new haven for Islamists of all stripes. They feared it would spell the end of even the possibility of a two-state solution. Most were convinced Hamas would never accept peace with Israel. Interestingly, there was consensus among Israelis and Palestinians on the dangers of Gaza's becoming a failed state. No one thought it would be easy to isolate and contain -- or had any clear ideas on how to respond to such a development. Israelis voiced no desire to go back into a densely populated place where nearly everyone has weapons and Israel would face, as one person told me, "our own Baghdad." But few Israelis felt they could tolerate continued rocket fire out of Gaza. Their conclusion: If Egypt does not act more decisively, Israel may have to occupy the area near the Egyptian border to stop the smuggling of larger and more effective weapons. As for Palestinians, the most striking conclusion was that it was essential that Hamas not succeed in the West Bank the way it is succeeding in Gaza. Fear is a great motivator, perhaps enough to overcome the personal rivalries that have hobbled Fatah in its competition with Hamas. I certainly found a new readiness among the young guard of Fatah (and the activists who represent Fatah's third and fourth generations) to organize themselves at the grass roots and rebrand Fatah. They know they lost the elections because of their divisions, the corruption of the old guard and their inability to respond to the needs of the Palestinian public. I saw a new awareness that Fatah must offer services and programs, not just words, if it is to preserve its hold on the West Bank. Among some I heard an interesting proposal: Let's make the West Bank work -- socially, economically and institutionally -- then hold up our model of success in contrast to the failure of Gaza, where functional unemployment is close to 70 percent. Let Hamas preside over a dysfunctional, lawless state. We will build our own. Let's create understandings with Jordan and Israel for at least economic confederation and security. And if Hamas still hangs on in Gaza, perhaps there can be a "three-state solution." Sounds good in theory, but I doubt it would work. No matter how sensible confederation between the Palestinian state and Jordan might be, at least economically, a failed state in Gaza would be a constant source of instability. Israel wouldn't find it easy to occupy just a narrow strip of territory to stop smuggling. The Israeli presence would invite an insurgency much like the one Israel faced in southern Lebanon. No alternative international force is likely to be vigilant or serious enough to do an effective job -- just look at Lebanon. Moreover, while West Bank and Gaza Palestinians have much that divides them, they still have a common identity as Palestinians; the creation of a Palestinian state without Gaza would be an endless source of grievance and irredentism. So what is to be done? If a failed state in Gaza is not acceptable, more has to be done now to prevent it. Egypt, while it has made commitments to stop the smuggling, does not see the situation as a national security threat. We will need to put a spotlight on this to change the Egyptian calculus and, at a minimum, to move Egypt to stop Hamas from accumulating more weaponry and money. If Fatah does have a plan for bolstering its forces in Gaza, it is worth supporting it by coordinating with the Israelis and Egyptians -- not to produce a bloodbath in Gaza but to deter Hamas from seeking to impose itself there. The logic of having donors (public and private) working with Fatah where it seeks to rebrand itself makes sense for the West Bank and Gaza. What Hamas has done in Gaza has provided a wake-up call for Fatah and Palestinian independents. They now know they have to compete socially, economically and politically. They need help to do so. It is time we, the other donors and the Saudis and the Gulf states woke up to the reality that if we don't help remake Fatah, we may face a future in which Islamists control the Palestinian issue and neither a two-state nor a three-state solution will be in the cards.

Bush later this month. The American proposed benchmark initiatives, which details actions for Israel and the Palestinian Authority to implement in the coming months, calls on Israel to remove many West Bank roadblocks and improve operations at the Gaza Strip's border crossings. The Palestinians were asked to halt rocket fire from Gaza and weapons smuggling into the Gaza Strip. The initiatives are seen as part of U.S.' efforts to revive peace process in the Middle East. Olmert is due to meet with Bush in the White House on June 19. As for the lifting of roadblocks, Israel considers it would be subject to its security considerations that should be implement gradually. The paper said that Israel would divide the American demands into three categories, the first step is that Israel is preparing to take the crossings issue. The other steps include Israel would allow Palestinians convoys to travel from the West Bank to Gaza if the security conditions are good, vice versa, Israel would not lift the Hawara checkpoint at the entrance to Nablus. Regarding the military operations in and out of Gaza as well as in the West Bank, Israeli government vowed it would continue without letup against the Qassam rocket attacks, which had been disturbing Israel for years. On Sunday, Olmert told the weekly cabinet meeting that "no one has immunity. This activity will continue as long as it contributes to Israel's security needs." Next Thursday, Olmert is set to meet Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas in Jericho, the first time that they will get together in the West Bank territory and not in Jerusalem. It is reported that Olmert might accede to release some of the estimated 700 million U.S. dollars in Palestinian tax and tariff revenues it has been withholding since Hamas formed its first government in March 2006. During a visit made by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Ricein March, Olmert and Abbas agreed to meet on biweekly basis, for the discussion of a political horizon consistent with the establishment of a Palestinian state.

The bomb exploded near the main gate of Forward Operating Base Warhorse, the largest U.S. military facility in , a restive territory north of . An Iraqi employee on the base said the bomb unleashed chlorine gas.

Soldiers were rushed to the clinic on base for treatment, but there were no deaths.. Iraqi soldiers and police officers stop a car at a checkpoint in Baghdad. Across the capital, police patrols reported finding 21 bodies, the victims of apparent sectarian killings. (By Khalid Mohammed -- Associated Press) Washington Post stories and multimedia reports about Iraq, Afghanistan, the War on Terror and more. Faces of the Fallen Veterans: In Their Own Words Save & Share Article "Something made them feel ill," said Lt. Col. Christopher C. Garver, a U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad. "What it is specifically, we haven't figured that out yet." The use of chlorine gas has become a regular weapon in the Sunni insurgent arsenal but rarely has been used against large numbers of American soldiers. The attack typified the difficulties soldiers face in Diyala, the scene of some of the most deadly fighting in the country in the past few months. soldiers were recently deployed to Diyala to battle a complex mix of Sunni and Shiite militant groups, and the American death toll there has risen steadily in recent weeks. Earlier Sunday in Diyala, a car bomb exploded as an patrol transported prisoners to a station in Balad Ruz, killing 15 people, including 11 police officers, and wounding 35, according to Lt. Mohammed Hakman of the provincial police. On Sunday, the U.S. military announced that a series of other bombings and shootings, most of them in and around Baghdad, took the lives of 14 soldiers and wounded 24 since Friday. May was the third-deadliest month for American troops in Iraq since the 2003 invasion, and the casualties in the past few days indicate that the insurgency shows no sign of abating. "This is going to get harder before it gets easier. We're fighting a determined, adaptive enemy that's trying to derail the security plan and kill as many American soldiers as it can," Garver said. "This is how we're going to get to long-term security, through this short-term upswing in contact with the enemy." U.S. military officials cite many reasons for the recent rise in fatalities, including the growing use of deeply buried, powerful roadside bombs that can blast through armored vehicles and the more aggressive tactics of American troops who are patrolling in greater numbers in unexplored areas. The counterinsurgency strategy launched by Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq, has moved soldiers off the sprawling, fortified American bases into smaller, more vulnerable outposts in violent neighborhoods to bring them into more sustained contact with the people they want to protect. But their presence creates more potential targets, as combat operations have expanded with the addition of five brigades of soldiers in Iraq, part of Most of the U.S. casualties since Friday resulted from roadside bombings, the deadliest weapon Americans face in Iraq. A roadside bomb northwest of Baghdad killed four soldiers on patrol Sunday, and two more soldiers were killed Saturday by a roadside bomb in Nineveh province, north of Baghdad. In a series of other attacks, two soldiers were killed in Diyala province and six in the Baghdad area. In one incident, a soldier on foot patrol southwest of Baghdad spotted two men near a mosque who appeared suspicious, the military said. As the soldier approached to question them, one of the men detonated explosives, killing himself and the soldier. Sporadic violence broke out elsewhere Sunday. Shiite militiamen from the , loyal to cleric , fought Iraqi soldiers and police in Diwaniyah, about 110 miles south of Baghdad. The clashes occurred as security forces conducted raids in the city, according to Iraqi police, while U.S. aircraft provided cover overhead. The fighting killed at least one Iraqi soldier and wounded 16 other people, said Brig. Gen. Sadiq Jaffar, commander of the Diwaniyah police. "During the raids, some outlaws were carrying unlicensed weapons and they shot people in a random way in order to spread fear and terrorize the people," he said. A spokesman for Sadr's organization in Diwaniyah said the violence began after Iraqi police violated a signed truce by attempting to arrest a senior Mahdi Army leader in the area without a warrant. The militia leader, Kifah al-Kuraiti, was wounded in the clashes, said Haider Nateq. Iraqi police said they had warrants for all their targets. In Baghdad early Sunday morning, Iraqi special operations troops exchanged gunfire with insurgents while the troops were raiding a government building in search of a senior militia leader believed responsible for coordinating kidnappings and roadside bomb attacks, the U.S. military said in a statement. The military did not identify the government building or the suspected militia leader. The U.S. military also reported that , working with Iraqi soldiers and police in the western city of , killed seven suspected members of the insurgent group , detained eight others and destroyed a truck bomb factory Saturday. Iraqi police patrols in the capital found at least 21 bodies, the victims of apparent sectarian killings.

Browse by Regions and/or Topics Public Diplomacy and Propaganda Gates Cites Progress in Afghanistan Despite New Insurgent Tactics Email to a Friend Gates Cites Progress in Afghanistan Despite New Insurgent Tactics | 04 Jun 2007 World Politics Review Exclusive KABUL, Afghanistan -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Monday reaffirmed the United States' long-term commitment to rebuilding Afghanistan and hailed "real progress" made by NATO forces this year against the Taliban insurgency, despite rising violence in the southern and eastern provinces and the arrival of deadly Iranian-made weapons. Gates, on his second visit to the country since taking the helm of the Pentagon, said that after a round of talks with President Hamid Karzai, NATO commanders and other Afghan officials involved in training the national army, he believes the security situation has improved in recent months. "The Afghan alliance offensive has put the Taliban off their game and I think that's been an important success this spring. The key is to sustain that," he told reporters at a joint press conference with Karzai at the presidential palace. "This is a winnable fight, I think there's been real progress," he continued. "It is also a long-term undertaking, and I am confident that the United States and our partners in the alliance will be here as long as it takes to ensure victory." Thirty-nine U.S. troops and 39 other coalition soldiers have been killed so far this year in Afghanistan, comparable to figures from this time a year ago, according to the Web site icasualties.org, which tracks casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. Last year was the bloodiest year since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion that drove the Taliban from power. Heavier fighting was expected this spring, but Western officials say a NATO counter-offensive, dubbed Operating Achilles, has succeeded in blunting the Taliban's advance across the volatile southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar.

The focal point of the effort is Helmand province, the country's opium heartland and a Taliban stronghold. Instead of waging pitched gun battles, militants are turning with greater frequency and accuracy to asymmetrical attacks such as suicide and roadside bombings -- increasingly with technologies from Iran. Marine Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Singapore over the weekend that Iranian-made armor-piercing explosives, known as EFPs, are now being used by Afghan insurgents. Gen. Pace said it was another sign they are "adapting and learning" from jihadist counterparts in Iraq, where such explosives are used with lethal effect. Secretary Gates said there is not any hard intelligence indicating the Iranian government is supporting or behind the inflow of EFPs. However, the United States has previously alleged that Iran was involved in exporting such weapons. "There have been indications over the past few months of weapons coming in from Iran," Gates said. "We do not have any information about whether the government of Iran is supporting this, is behind it, or whether it's smuggling, or exactly what's behind it." "But there is clearly evidence that some weapons are coming into Afghanistan destined for the Taliban," he added, noting the possible hand of criminal elements involved in drug trafficking from Iran. President Karzai downplayed the allegations, saying that "Iran and Afghanistan have never been as friendly as they are today" and thanking Tehran for its contributions toward his country's reconstruction. "There's no reason that any of our neighbors should support the Taliban," Karzai said. No mention was made of the nearly 100,000 Afghan migrants that Iran has deported since April 21, with plans for one million by next march. Some analysts perceive the campaign to be part of a broader effort to undermine stability next door. Asked whether the coming months are make or break in the fight against the Taliban, Karzai asserted that the war "has been won" and it's now a matter of putting the "finishing touches" on the insurgency. "The continuation of the struggle is to remove [the Taliban] as terrorist cells hiding from the law," the Afghan president said. "It is the finishing touches that we're giving them now." But Pentagon officials note that violence this spring is actually up from the same time last year and are concerned that once the opium poppy harvest is completed in the coming months more Taliban fighters will take up arms again.

Two Lebanese soldiers and a fighter were killed Monday in the clashes between the army and Jund al-Sham Islamic militants in the refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh in Sidon, southern Lebanon. Palestinian factions have formed a security force to ease the tension, but a senior Fatah Islam commander in the northern Nahr el-Bared refugee camp pledged to take the battle to Ein el-Hilweh, Lebanon's largest refugee camp. The 16-days of fighting between the army and Fatah Islam have killed over 100 people, the worst internal violence since the end of the 1975-90 civil war. Since the fighting started, there has been a spate of bombings in and around Beirut -- including one Monday evening on an empty passenger bus in a Christian suburb that wounded 10 passers-by. In Nahr el-Bared near the northern port city of Tripoli, the army resumed its pounding of militant hideouts with artillery after sporadic exchanges earlier in the day, sending up plumes of black smoke. The military also rolled additional armor into Nahr el-Bared in an apparent bid to push deeper into the camp. The army has been blasting Fatah Islam positions since May 20, but scaled up its offensive Friday to crush the al Qaeda-inspired militants. The government has demanded that Fatah Islam surrender, but the militants have vowed to fight to death. Ten Lebanese soldiers have been killed at Nahr el-Bared and 44 others wounded since Friday, including four hurt by a mortar shell Monday, raising the army's death toll to 45 at Nahr el-Bared and two at Ein el-Hilweh. At least 20 civilians and about 60 militants have also been killed in the northern Lebanon fighting, but civilian casualties in the camp in the last four days were unknown. The International Red Cross on Monday evacuated a wounded civilian and 17 women and children who wished to leave the camp. The bombardment of Nahr el-Bared has angered Palestinians in some of Lebanon's 11 other refugee camps. It is believed that militants who attacked the army at Ein el-Hilweh were seeking to take the military pressure off their Fatah Islam allies. The trouble in Ein el-Hilweh began Sunday evening when Jund al-Sham militants began targeting army checkpoints surrounding the camp with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic rifles. Troops returned machine gun and cannon fire. Fighting picked up overnight and resumed briefly Monday morning. Two Lebanese soldiers were killed and five wounded in the clashes. One Jund al-Sham official was wounded, and several houses belonging to members of the group were burned down by army shells, Lebanese security and Palestinian officials said. On Monday, Palestinian police stood alongside Lebanese troops at the camp's entrance to prevent attacks. Secular Palestinian factions complained that Islamic groups were shielding the militants, and residents worried whether violence would resume. Residents who fled fighting Sunday evening returned briefly to the camp Monday to pick up a few belongings. Militiamen of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah faction hung out on the main street on the camp's northern edge, eyeing bearded gunmen standing in side-streets. "There's horror every day here -- bombs, shootings...," said Suzanne Ajawi, 26, who's nine months pregnant. She carried a plastic bag of baby clothes and milk. The Ein el-Hilweh clashes underscored the complexities of fighting militants in Palestinian refugee camps, where the crowded towns have become havens for extremists and criminals. The army does not enter Palestinian refugee camps under a nearly 40-year-old arrangement whereby Palestinians run their own affairs. Ein el-Hilweh, home to some 60,000, is notorious for its lawlessness, and neighborhoods are run by rival factions. Jund al-Sham, based in Ein el-Hilweh and believed to number in the dozens, has claimed responsibility or been blamed for a number of bombings and gunbattles, mainly in Lebanon and Syria. Fatah Islam's deputy leader on Monday pledged to spread the militant group's battle with the Lebanese army to Ein el-Hilweh. "Soon there will be an official statement in the name of Fatah Islam partisans, and we will start to see an expansion [of the fighting in the north], and there will be a similar military situation there [in Ein el-Hilweh]," Abu Hureira said by cellular phone from his hideout in Nahr el-Bared. Following a Cabinet meeting, Information Minister Ghazi Aridi said there was a "clear link" between the violence in Ein el-Hilweh and Nahr el-Bared. Most of Nahr el-Bared's 31,000 people have fled to a nearby camp. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency on Monday launched an appeal for $12.7 million to address the urgent needs of more than 27,000 Palestinian refugees displaced by the northern fighting. .

With 25 people dead, the unrest spread to the fringes of New Delhi on Monday as thousands of Gujjars, a class of farmers and shepherds, pressed their demand to be officially shunted to the lowest rung of India's hereditary caste system so they can get government jobs and university spots reserved for such groups. "I am farmer and I am poor," Rajesh Gurjjar, 26, said after police chased him off a main street in this New Delhi suburb, his thin T-shirt shirt soaked with sweat. "I want a government job. It pays more. The office is cool in summer. The fields are too hot." To put it another way, the fastest way up India's economic ladder now is a quick step down its age-old social ladder. While caste violence is not new, many see a paradox in the Gujjars' struggle. The political importance of the caste system is growing even as the rise of an urbanized and educated middle class has weakened its grip socially, making it more acceptable for a group to try to fight its way down instead of pushing its way up. "This isn't a case of a group agitating for the primacy or superiority of their caste. It has nothing to do with a claim of caste loyalty according to the Hindu world view or religious scriptures," said Parvan K. Varma, author of "Being Indian," a book about Indian society. "This is the use of caste as political negotiating currency. It's about a finite cake and a caste community attempting to get a piece," he said. The politics were clear late Monday when Gujjar leaders called off their protests after officials agreed to look into their demands. The move immediately drew threats from leaders of a rival caste, the Meena, who are classified among the lowest castes and don't want more competitors for reserved jobs and school spots. During the unrest, clashes between Meenas and Gujjars killed at least four people. The origins and inner workings of the caste system are the subject of much debate. The system divides people into four broad groups, with the priestly caste at the top. There are hundreds of sub-castes within each group, most of them drawn along occupational lines. While the caste system is part of Hinduism, there are also caste-like divisions among Muslims, who account for 13 percent of India's 1.1 billion people, and Christians, who make up 2.4 percent. Although the system was outlawed after independence from Britain in 1947, its influence remains powerful and the government has sought to redress discrimination against those on the lower rungs by setting quotas for government jobs and university spots. Rather than weaken caste affiliations, the result has been a fracturing of politics along caste lines as lower groups vie for a share of the quotas. Further complicating matters is that caste has never been as rigid a system as imagined in the West &mdash; there is, over generations, movement within subgroups, sociologists say &mdash; and determining who gets access to the quotas has long been an issue of red-hot contention. There have been repeated protests the past year over a government plan to reserve more than a quarter of the spots at India's top professional schools for the 3,743 castes and sub-castes, Gujjars among them, classified in the second-to-lowest category, the "Other Backward Classes." That plan was suspended in March by a Supreme Court ruling that presaged the Gujjar protests. "No where in the world do castes queue up to be branded as backward. No where in the world is there a competition to become backward," the court said. Less controversial have been the decades-old quotas for those on the lowest rung of the caste system &mdash; the "Scheduled Castes and Tribes," a group that include the "dalits," once known as "untouchables." India's 160 million dalits have no caste, and for centuries have been viewed as "pollutants." Many are forced to live in separate villages, forbidden from drawing water at wells used by other Hindus and often subjected to violent abuse. It is this group the Gujjars want to join. "Our people have not benefited from India's economic growth. Most Gujjars are herders. They live in huts on the hills. This is a matter of survival," said Bharat Tanwar, 30, who took part in a peaceful protest in New Delhi on Friday. That may be true for most Gujjars, although not for Tanwar &mdash; he's a textile engineer. "But I did not go to a top university, I cannot make so much money," he said. "I want my son to go to a top engineering school, to work with computers."

The explosion occurred in the residential and industrial Bouchrieh suburb, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. Lebanon has seen a string of bomb explosions in and around Beirut since clashes between Fatah Islam militants and the Lebanese army began May 20. Lebanon has also been hit by a series of explosions in the last two years, particularly targeting Christian areas. Two explosions on May 21 and 22 killed a woman and injured a dozen people in two Beirut neighborhoods, as the Lebanese army battled militants holed up in a refugee camp near the northern port city of Tripoli. On May 23, a bomb exploded in the Druse town of Aley in Beirut's central mountains, wounding at least five people. On March 26, 2005, a blast went off in an industrial zone in Bouchrieh, injuring five people and setting factories ablaze.

The views expressed are the author's alone. RAMALLAH, 4 June 2007 (IRIN) - Rights group Amnesty International on Monday said Palestinians were dying in the West Bank because Israel's restrictions on movement there are severely hampering access to health services. Israel controls the 2.5 million Palestinians through a matrix of more than 500 checkpoints and roadblocks as well as a 700km barrier that encloses 10 percent of the West Bank on the Israeli side. Amnesty listed Palestinians it said had died as a result of delays at checkpoints or who had been shot dead by soldiers manning the barriers, and called on Israel to tear down barriers inside the West Bank and lift restrictions at checkpoints. Israeli government spokesman Shlomo Dror said the measures were vital to protect Israeli civilians. "They reduce terrorism against Israeli civilians. We know it's not convenient for the Palestinians. But my life is more important than the Palestinians' quality of life. If they choose to attack us they must realize there are consequences," Dror said. In its report "Enduring Occupation: Palestinians under siege in the West Bank" marking 40 years of military occupation, Amnesty said the real reason for the checkpoints and the barrier was to protect Israel's West Bank settlements, home to 450,000 settlers, which are illegal under international law. "Palestinians living in the West Bank are blocked at every turn. This is not simply an inconvenience - it can be a matter of life or death," said Malcolm Smart, director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa programme. "It is unacceptable that women in labour, sick children, or victims of accidents on their way to hospital should be forced to take long detours and face delays which can cost them their lives." Liz Sime, country director for CARE International, told IRIN the barrier and internal roadblocks were creating an unnecessary humanitarian situation in the West Bank. "One of the key reasons we have such a huge humanitarian programme here is because the Palestinians cannot move. They can't get their produce to market and they can't get to the doctor, even if he is only 10km away," Sime said. CARE drives mobile clinics to isolated communities and tries to help farmers get their produce through checkpoints. The organisation's humanitarian budget has gone from US$4 million&#160;in 1999&#160;to $27 million a year today to deal with the impact of movement restrictions. Among the hardest hit are about 50,000 Palestinians, whose homes and villages are on the western or Israeli side of Israel's West Bank barrier. The International Court of Justice ruled in July 2004 that the barrier's route was illegal under international humanitarian and human rights law. In villages such as Azzun Atma, Palestinians enter and exit their village through a gate manned by soldiers and locked between 10pm and 6am. In February, 21-year-old Adel Omar died before doctors could treat him in the West Bank town of Qalqilya after his passage to hospital was blocked for an hour at the barrier. The soldiers refused to come down from their tower because it was after 10pm, according to the Israeli human rights organisation Btselem. After the incident, the Israeli military said it would staff the gate 24 hours a day. Pregnant women from the village leave their homes several days before they are due to give birth so they will not be blocked from getting to hospital if they go into labour at night, villagers told IRIN. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said that in April, 33 of its ambulances were delayed at checkpoints and denied passage on 14 of those occasions. The longest delay, near Jerusalem, was almost six hours. "The Israeli and Palestinian authorities have the right to inspect ambulances. The issue is whether the delay caused is undue. There have been improvements but there is still a long way to go," said Bernard Burrell, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Jerusalem. The ICRC was trying to organise humanitarian traffic lanes at checkpoints on narrow roads so ambulances could get to the front of the queue rather than be "stuck for an hour behind waiting cars", he added. "The Palestinians use ambulances to smuggle terrorists who are coming to do a terrorist attack," Dror said. Sime said the checkpoints had divided the West Bank into three areas, with the northern West Bank and the Jordan Valley also particularly hard hit by restrictions. Men aged between 16 and 35 have been banned from leaving Nablus, the West Bank's biggest city, for the past six years. "They can no longer work in Israel and they can't get down to Ramallah to work in the construction sites there because they can't get a permit to move," said Sime. But the consequence is that poverty amongst Palestinians is spreading, and with it food insecurity. In March, the World Food Programme and Food and Agriculture Organization reported that 60 percent of West Bank residents had reduced their spending on food. Families are reducing portions, eating only one meal a day, buying lower-quality food and eating less fruit, vegetables and fresh meat, the report found.

"There has been some escalation in the rhetoric. We think that is not helpful," said U.S. National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley while accompanying U.S. President George W. Bush on his trip to Europe. "We would like to have a constructive dialogue with Russia on this issue. We have had it in the past," Hadley said. Putin warned on Monday that Russia would take retaliatory measures against the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in Eastern Europe. "In case of the deployment of anti-missile defense systems in Europe we warn that there will be retaliatory steps. We have to ensure our security. And this process was not initiated by us," Putin said in an interview. The United States plans to deploy missile interceptors in Poland and radar units in the Czech Republic as part of a project to extend the missile defense system in Europe.

The video — from the Islamic State of , an umbrella insurgent group that includes Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia — did not provide proof of whether the two missing soldiers were alive or dead. But an American military official with the missing soldiers’ unit said the identification cards appeared to be authentic, suggesting that the group was involved in the attack. The narrator of the video asserted that the soldiers were dead. “We decided to finish this issue and announce the killing of the soldiers and to make the enemies of God carry the bitter responsibility,” the video’s narrator said. “After the three soldiers were alive as prisoners they became dead bodies.” American military officials said they would study the video for clues and continue searching for the two missing soldiers, Spc. Alex R. Jimenez , 25, of Lawrence, Mass., and Pvt. Byron W. Fouty, 19, of Waterford, Mich. “We’ve been on the lookout for something like this,” said Lt. Col. Christopher Garver, an American military spokesman in Baghdad. Investigators, he said, “will continue to review it for whatever information we can gain from it.” The video did not refer by name to the third abducted soldier, Pfc. Joseph J. Anzack Jr., 20, of Torrance, Calif. Private Anzack’s body was pulled from the Euphrates River in Babil Province, south of Baghdad, 11 days after the ambush on May 12. Videos of kidnapped Westerners and attacks against American troops have frequently been used for propaganda purposes by insurgents. Monday’s video was significant largely because it was less graphic than usual and provided little actual evidence that those who produced the video actually held the two soldiers captive or killed them. Its limited scope and appearance nearly a month after the ambush seemed to confirm what some American military commanders have suspected all along: that the insurgents are seeking to drag out the process of discovery and deny closure to the families of the missing soldiers and the thousands of American and Iraqi troops who have been searching for them since the day they disappeared. The undated video was made available to reporters by the Site Institute, which tracks Jihadist Web sites. Of the nearly 11 minutes of footage, the only portion that purportedly corresponds to the attack shows what appears to be a burning Humvee, videotaped from far away at night for a few seconds. The attack — which occurred before dawn near Yusifiya, a Sunni stronghold about 15 miles south of the capital — did lead to the burning of two Humvees that were attacked, according to military officials. But the video does not show the three soldiers who were abducted nor the five soldiers killed during the ambush, one of whom was an Iraqi. What the video displays is a group of masked men apparently planning the ambush using a diagram pinned to a tree. Personal items that appear to belong to the soldiers are also shown, including a pistol, credit cards and American and Iraqi money. At the end, the video shows a still image of both sides of the photo identifications of Specialist Jimenez and Private Fouty. Above the photos, written in Arabic, was the message, “Bush is the reason for the loss of your sons.” The video repeatedly mocks the American military for being unable to find the three abducted soldiers. Citing the American use of helicopters and unmanned aircraft, the video’s narrator said, “They felt arrogant because of their abilities and their technology, which was humiliated by the Islamic State’s soldiers.” Despite the deployment of 4,000 American troops, the video said, “they failed.” “No one will be held responsible for what happened to the three soldiers,” the narrator said, “except the American Army and its leaders and politicians who degrade all of mankind and do not care for the feelings of the three soldiers’ mothers.” David S. Cloud, Richard A. Oppel Jr. and Ahmad Fadam, contributed reporting. More Articles in International &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Monday, 4th June 2007 Mon 4 Jun 2007 Gertruda Grzebski with her husband, Jan, who was sent home to die after being left in a coma by a railway accident in 1988. "For 19 years, she did the job of an experienced intensive care team," their doctor said. Picture: EPA The man who fell asleep for 19 years AS HIS fellow Poles sought to break the Soviet Union's grip on the country and the threat loomed large that Moscow would send in the tanks, the world suddenly went black for Jan Grzebski when an accident left him in a coma. Now, 19 years later, he has woken to a radically different world. Gone are the meat shortages, the stench of poorly refined petrol, the drab drudgery of life behind the Iron Curtain. In 1988, when he was hit by a train and sent home to die, Poland was a Communist state under prime minister General Wojciech Jaruzelski. Dissidents and activists for the Solidarity union, led by Lech Walesa, were harassed by the authorities amid a state of martial law. Since then Mr Walesa has been elected president and ousted by the electorate, the Soviet Union has collapsed and Poland has become a member of the European Union. Mr Grzebski missed a lot more besides the political upheaval - not least seeing his children growing up to have their own children. He woke to discover he was a grandfather 11 times over. His story is a real-life version of the hit German comedy Goodbye, Lenin, in which a die-hard East German Communist falls into a coma just as the Berlin Wall is crumbling. When she wakes up, her son, mindful of doctors' warnings not to let her experience too many profound shocks, goes to extraordinary lengths to pretend the Communists are still in charge. But Mr Grzebski, 65, knew immediately he woke up that his world had changed. He saw the difference in the vibrant colours of advertising posters, a western medium that had no place under the Communists, outside his bedroom window. "I have a lot of catching up to do," said the former railway worker. "Now I see people on the streets with mobile phones and there are so many goods in the shops it makes my head spin." He credits his survival to his wife, Gertruda, who cared for him. "The doctors in Warsaw gave me only three years at best. I was out of hospital in a month and basically sent home to die," he said. "The train hit me right on the head. I didn't feel a thing. The ambulancemen didn't even think it was worth taking me to hospital. "If I had stayed in one of those places, I would have died. But Gertruda gave me the best medicine of all - her love. She turned me over to stop me getting sores, she said she spoke to me all the time, she kissed me, washed me, made sure all the tubes were sticking in the right places at the right time." He has no memory of her years of devotion, but he said: "I am sure that something of her wonderful spirit touched me during all that time. She was truly my saviour and I hope to live to be able to spend a few good years with her and to enjoy our grandchildren together." Mrs Grzebski said she tried always to think of her husband as though he was alive, despite the pessimism of others. "I cried a lot, and I prayed a lot. Those who came to see us kept asking, 'when is he going to die?' But he refused to die," she said. "When we got married, we made the pledge for better or for worse. I could never have done anything other than that what I did. "The neighbours helped out, as did the children when they got older. I remember all of them coming in to show papa their babies when they were born. Sometimes Jan's eyes flickered, but he never seemed to be aware of anything. "We took him to family gatherings and birthdays, always tried to make him involved, as if he was still with us in every sense. He thinks he remembers, vaguely, some of the occasions, so it must have been worth it. So much better than to treat him like a dying man." Mr Grzebski is wistful about a past that he only remembers as being hard. "When I went into a coma, there was only tea and vinegar in the shops, meat was rationed and huge petrol queues were everywhere," he said. "There was trouble brewing, that was for sure. But then 'bang', the lights went out for me, and now they have come on again with a blinding flash." He said he was amazed by mobile phones and how much time people now spend "moaning into them". "They don't seem to know how lucky they are - back then we really had some things to moan about," he said. Medical experts agreed it was his wife's extraordinary devotion, as well as his sound constitution, that brought him back from a living death. "For 19 years, Mrs Grzebski did the job of an experienced intensive care team, changing her comatose husband's position every hour to prevent bed-sore infections," said Dr Boguslaw Poniatowski, a physician who monitored him over the past decade. Mr Grzebski said: "I feel like I have been reborn." â€¢ Poland was a Communist country. John Paul II, a Pole, was Pope. â€¢ A state of martial law existed amid protests by the union Solidarity led by Lech Walesa, pictured. â€¢ Television was black and white for most people. â€¢ Many staple foods were rationed. The rent on Mr Grzebski's house was Â£10 a month. â€¢ Jaroslaw Kaczynski, a conservative, is prime minister. â€¢ The army is to be purged of senior officers who co-operated with Communist secret police. â€¢ Mobile phones and DVDs are commonplace. â€¢ A market economy has brought in foreign investment, but unemployment is high. , Canada / 2:26am 4 Jun 2007 Well, at least the eternal problems in the middle east will make him feel at home.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This By JUDY DEMPSEY and Published: June 4, 2007 BERLIN, June 4 — President Bush flew to Europe today for talks with world leaders later this week, including President of Russia, in the wake of a threat by Mr. Putin to point Russian missiles at Europe if the United States builds its missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Skip to next paragraph China Releases Climate Change Plan News Analysis: Bush Climate Plan: Amid Nays, Some Maybes In an interview with journalists from the other big industrialized countries that was released on the Kremlin Web site, Mr. Putin set an uncompromising tone before the start of the group’s summit meeting in Germany on Wednesday. His comments set a challenge for Mr. Bush, who flew to Prague in the Czech Republic today before the meeting in Germany. The comments drew criticism from , which described Mr. Putin’s statements as “unhelpful and unwelcome.” Speaking in Washington today, the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said flatly that Russia’s concerns — and its threat to target European sites — would not lead the United States to cancel the missile program, and he rejected the idea that it could lead to a new arms race. “It’s just not helpful, certainly surprising,” Mr. McCormack said, referring to Mr. Putin’s comments. “They have more the ring of 1977 than they do 2007, so you know, I don’t know quite what to make of it.” Mr. Putin said Russia would not stand back and allow Washington to expand its nuclear potential in Europe, even though the new interceptors that the United States intends to deploy in Poland would not carry nuclear warheads. “Europe is being filled with new weapons,” Mr. Putin said, according to the transcript. “We ask ourselves what is going on.” He said the United States’ planned new installations would be an “inseparable part of the U.S. nuclear potential,” and said the Iranian missiles that America’s bases are intended to protect against “do not exist.” “If the American nuclear potential grows in European territory, we have to give ourselves new targets in Europe,” Mr. Putin was quoted as saying by Corriere della Sera, an Italian newspaper that took part in the interview. “It is up to our military to define these targets, in addition to defining the choice between ballistic and cruise missiles. But this is just a technical aspect.” Asked whether the American plan to build a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe would force Moscow to direct its own missiles against cities or American military targets in Europe, Mr. Putin replied, “Naturally, yes,” according to the newspaper. Der Spiegel, the German weekly newsmagazine, which also took part in the interview, reported that Mr. Putin had warned about the greater possibility of a nuclear conflict. There was little immediate international reaction to Mr. Putin’s criticisms. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who will host the Group of 8 meeting, wants to lower tensions ahead of the discussions, German diplomats and advisers said. But NATO criticized Mr. Putin’s comments. “These kind of comments are unhelpful and unwelcome,” James Appathurai, a spokesman for NATO, said. The differences over America’s plans for the missile shield are likely to dominate the talks in Europe. Ms. Merkel and Group of 8 leaders from Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and the United States had been hoping that their meeting could reach a consensus over a separate issue, the future status of Kosovo, one of the last unresolved conflicts of the Balkan wars of the 1990s. has drawn up a plan that would pave the way for Kosovo to become independent from Serbia, ending the province’s status as a United Nations international protectorate. This arrangement has been in place since 1999. That independence would be supervised by the But Russia, which has veto power as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , made it clear last week in Potsdam, Germany, at a meeting of Group of 8 foreign ministers that it did not accept the plan and instead wanted a resumption of talks between Serbia and Kosovo. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, used that meeting to sharply criticize the United States and the missile defense plan. European diplomats said Mr. Putin’s blunt remarks were intended not only to sow divisions in Europe over the American missile defense plans but also to try to extract concessions over Kosovo. In Germany, Ms. Merkel’s partners in the coalition government, the Social Democrats, oppose the American plan and have even suggested that Germany pursue a policy of “equal distance” between Russia and the United States. But Ms. Merkel, the conservative leader of the Christian Democrats, has challenged Mr. Putin on several issues, including his views about the missile defense system. Ms. Merkel has personally told Mr. Putin that America’s plans are in no way directed against Russia. American officials have also repeatedly told Mr. Putin that Russia would be informed of every step along the way and could even visit the sites in Poland, where the interceptors would be based, and in the Czech Republic, where the United States plans to deploy the radar system. Russia, however, has not taken up the offer of visiting the sites. Mr. Putin is due to visit the United States for talks with Mr. Bush on July 1 and 2.

New Delhi has already said it would reject such calls at this week's Group of Eight summit, where climate change will be a key topic, because stricter limits would slow its booming economy. 'There have been attempts to draw large developing countries such as India and China into taking greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments which is not as per the Kyoto Protocol,' the environment ministry said in a statement. The 1997 Kyoto deal requires industrialised countries to reduce emissions of six greenhouse gases by 5.2 pct by 2008-2012 compared with their 1990 levels. The United States and Australia have refused to ratify the treaty. Blaming industrial nations for the problem, India called for further commitments from them to limit greenhouse gas emissions. 'Developed countries should come forward and take further deeper commitments beyond 2012,' the ministry said, adding India contributed only 4 pct to total global emissions. US President George Bush said last month that he would urge rich nations at the G8 summit in Heiligendamm in Germany to join a new global framework for fighting climate change once the Kyoto Protocol lapses. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has invited China, India and other leading emerging nations to the summit. Together, India and China will by 2015 produce more greenhouse gases than the US, and Merkel has warned that a new pact to replace Kyoto would be doomed unless they signed up. Both the Asian giants have signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol, but are not included in targeted emission cuts. Germany has called for a statement limiting worldwide temperature rise this century to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and cuts to global greenhouse emissions to 50 pct below 1990 levels by 2050. Global debate on climate change has acquired a new urgency as the Kyoto Protocol, the only global agreement that sets specific targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, expires at the end of 2012. Talks on renewing the deal are underway, with the next round scheduled to take place in Indonesia in December. India said climate change would impact developing countries more, and expressed concern over its fallout on its agriculture -- which employs nearly 70 pct of the country's workforce. 'It will take decades for us to reach the level of the developed countries of today,' the government said. 'In order to meet the demands of rising standards of living and providing access to commercial energy to those lacking it, the total emission of greenhouse gases is bound to increase in India.' The ministry said more than half of India's 1.1 bln population still did not have access to commercial energy supplies. Copyright AFX News Limited 2007. All rights reserved.

Earthquake in China kills 3, injures 290 in tea-making region 5-year-old boy fatally crushed, state TV reports By Anita Chang, Associated Press | BEIJING -- An earthquake in southwest China early yesterday left at least three people dead -- including a boy crushed by debris -- while injuring hundreds, destroying buildings, and forcing the evacuation of 120,000 residents, state media reported. The 6.4-magnitude quake struck the county seat of Ning'er shortly after 5:30 a.m., said China's official Xinhua News Agency, citing the government's seismological bureau. The US Geological Survey measured the quake's magnitude at 6.2. At least three people died and more than 290 were injured, 15 seriously, Xinhua reported. One of the dead was a 5-year-old boy who was crushed by debris, state television reported. The boy's parents were also trapped but were rescued by local residents . Residents said the initial quake lasted about a minute and that many residents fled their homes to find safety in open areas. Others moved into tents after their homes were damaged, said a retired schoolteacher who gave only her surname, Dong. "Many old buildings, especially those built in the 1970s, either have cracks in the walls or have collapsed," Dong told the Associated Press by phone. News footage aired on China Central Television showed partly collapsed brick homes and soldiers knocking down unstable structures. Doctors and nurses treated the injured in a large tent. Rescue teams with thousands of tents, quilts, and other relief supplies were rushing to the area, Xinhua reported. Ning'er lies in a quake-prone mountainous region in Yunnan Province about 90 miles north of Laos, and is famous for its strong tea, known as Pu'er. For centuries, the area sat astride an important trade route for tea and horses that ran along western China between central Asia and southeastern Asia. Many of the area's residents belong to the Hani and Yi minority groups that once thrived in small hillside villages but have moved into the county seat. The quake damaged pipes, cutting off water supplies, and though electricity was still on in some areas, shops and schools were closed, Dong said. Xinhua said communications lines were also down , making it difficult for residents to make phone calls.

But mixed in with the doubts was a substantial dose of support, albeit conditional. Skip to next paragraph White House In No Hurry With Options to Kyoto Pact To some scientists, officials and experts immersed for years in troubled treaty talks under the , the president’s new plan is a potentially useful tool for gaining new consensus. The plan calls for rounding up the world’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases and, in 18 months, settling on nation-by-nation programs for slowing emissions and on a long-term common goal for reducing them. The value, those supporters say, comes from working with relatively small groups of countries and industries to iron out particular issues — say, how to limit tropical deforestation or clean up heavily emitting industries. Such talks could make it easier to find consensus in the formal rounds of United Nations treaty negotiations among nearly 200 nations, they say. But supporters say that will work only if Mr. Bush sticks to his administration’s pledge to have its efforts feed into United Nations climate discussions, which resume in Bali in December. They say that the formalized process of treaty making is the only way of assuring accountability. For the moment, skepticism about Mr. Bush’s commitment still rules. After all, for six years Mr. Bush insisted the science was too iffy and the costs of change too high to justify more than mild steps to blunt growth in greenhouse gas emissions, which come mainly from using coal and oil, the fossil fuels that underpin modern economies. And his representatives in international climate talks, as recently as last month, rejected any new negotiations under international climate treaties. Nonetheless, David G. Victor, a law professor and director of ’s program on energy and sustainable development, said he was cautiously optimistic that the president’s project could help end policy deadlocks. The main forum for common climate policy is the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change , which set nonbinding goals for cutting emissions to avoid “dangerous” climate change, but never defined how much warming was too much. Emissions rose relentlessly, leading to fresh talks culminating in the , negotiated in Japan in 1997 and enacted in 2005, which has binding limits on emissions for three dozen industrialized countries. But those limits expire in 2012. The Kyoto pact was signed under President Clinton but never sent to the Senate for approval, then rejected outright by Mr. Bush in 2001. And the Kyoto Protocol looks easy compared with what comes next. The idea was that after the Kyoto pact each subsequent step in the treaty process would bring stricter and broader limits on emissions. “Much of the world is skeptical because the Bush administration has such a poor track record on this topic,” Professor Victor said. “But on the face of it, this initiative does not undermine Kyoto. If the initiative leads to more serious efforts by the U.S. and by key developing countries, it will in fact breathe life into the whole enterprise aimed at protecting the planet, including Kyoto.” Mr. Bush’s new proposal starts with a summit meeting in the United States this fall, gathering up to 15 countries responsible for 85 percent of the emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. Mr. Bush plans to invite several developing countries, including China and India, to the talks; developing countries will soon be the main source of greenhouse emissions. By the end of 2008, he said, the countries would forge national plans for slowing emissions from 2012 through 2030 or so, devise uniform methods for measuring progress, increase research and testing of nonpolluting energy options, and settle on a common, but nonbinding, target for eventual large reductions in emissions decades out. It is a piecemeal strategy that, in theory, builds the means for curbing the gases from the bottom up. In contrast, the strategy pursued by European leaders and environmentalists for the period after 2012 works from the top down, framed around a broader Kyoto-style cap on emissions. European officials have largely panned Mr. Bush’s offering, saying it could well undercut talks aimed at new, binding restrictions. But some important figures in Europe are tentatively embracing the move by Mr. Bush. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the chief climate adviser to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, said the president’s bottom-up approach has legitimacy among scientists. “Each nation tries to set up its own road map, with short- and midterm goals for decarbonization,” he said last week. “You collect these road maps into a global atlas.” He and some other climate-policy experts said that both approaches would probably be needed given the wide range of conflicting interests, emissions sources, economic circumstances and energy choices in countries contributing to the greenhouse buildup; deforestation is the main concern in Brazil and Indonesia, vast heaps of coal the main issue in the United States and China, and fast growth in emissions in poorer parts of Europe. And on Friday, the United Nations secretary general, — who plans his own push on climate action within the United Nations this fall — endorsed Mr. Bush’s proposal, particularly if it is tied into talks aimed at invigorating the treaty. “I think it is a positive statement, in the sense that the United States, at the level of President Bush, has realized the urgency and importance of climate change,” Mr. Ban said. “I hope such an effort by the United States will be mutually reinforcing the international community’s efforts, particularly led by the United Nations.” James L. Connaughton, the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the world should embrace several simultaneous efforts to avoid dangerous climate change and at the same time boost nonpolluting energy supplies. “We need it all,” he told reporters last week. “And those who suggest there’s one approach versus another, they’re not facing reality.” Still, many say Mr. Bush will have to work hard to overcome strong doubts. Michael K. Dorsey, an assistant professor of environmental studies at , said Mr. Bush would have to show concrete progress in the fall to overcome “a legacy of stalling, back-pedaling and undermining of international talks.” “Give us a press conference to say what you’ve done yesterday,” he said. “Don’t tell us any more what you’re going to do tomorrow.” Mark Landler contributed reporting from Frankfurt.

Emergence of Taliban rule in Afghanistan Kandahar, November 20, 2005 Suspected Taliban rebels kidnapped an Indian and three Afghans working on a road construction project in the country's volatile south, officials said on Sunday. The four were working for an Indian company refurbishing the main road from the southern city of Kandahar to Herat in the west. Nimroz provincial Governor Ghulam Dasthaqir said the Indian and one of the Afghans worked as drivers, while the other two were policemen providing security. The four were kidnapped after being ambushed as they drove in Nimroz late on Saturday night, he said. "We've had no contact with the kidnappers but we're investigating," Dasthaqir said. The abduction was the latest in a string of kidnappings in southern Afghanistan. A British engineer working on a road project and two Japanese tourists were kidnapped in August and killed. The violence comes amid the deadliest year of rebel fighting since the ouster of the Taliban in 2001. About 1,500 people have been killed and many southern and eastern areas are considered too dangerous for foreigners to enter without security.

Clashes in Refugee Camp Fighting intensifies at Lebanon camp / Three Lebanese soldiers killed Saturday in clashes with Fatah al-Islam group, which involved first-time airforce involvement. Militants vow not to surrender, while Palestinian clerics appeal for truce According to the sources, local political and security elements foiled the plot, which was dubbed â€œOperation 755â€. The militia planned to establish an â€œIslamic principalityâ€ in Tripoli and in several other areas in northern Lebanon with the help of al-Qaeda members who fled Iraq and reached Lebanon through Syria. The extremists also planned to carry out a number of terror attacks in Beirut and nearby towns, after which Fatah el-Islam leader Shaker al-Abssi was to declare his rule over a region in northern Lebanon. Last February three people were killed in two explosions on the road leading to the Lebanese Christian mountain town of Bikfaya, the home town of former President Amin Gemayel, whose son Pierre was assassinated in November in Beirut. Lebanese sources said the blasts were aimed at destabilizing Lebanonâ€™s security situation and undermine its stability, adding that the perpetratorsâ€™ arrest thwarted al-Abssiâ€™s plan. The Fatah el-Islam leader said the group would have to expand beyond Palestinian refugee camp Nahr el-Bared into other areas in northern Lebanon, assuming it would be assisted by sleeper cells. The Lebanese sources said the constant hunt for the Fatah el-Islam militants helped local security forces expose al-Abssiâ€™s plot and detain those who were supposed to lead the revolt. The sources said the security establishment was able to put its hands on CDs containing detailed information on Fatah el-Islamâ€™s plan. Forces also arrested a man who rented out a building in Tripoli in which 450 kilos (about 990 pounds) of substances used to make explosives were hidden. These substances were later used by Fatah el-Islam. Lebanese authorities traced the materials to a Syrian plant.

The father of four's last memories, from 1988, were of toiling as a railway worker under the communist regime of General Wojciech Jaruzelski. Now, after 19 years, Mr Grzebski has woken to an unimaginably changed country -- and he has found himself a 65-year-old grandfather of 11. "When I went into a coma there was only tea and vinegar in the shops, meat was rationed, and huge petrol lines were everywhere," Mr Grzebski told Polish TV. "Now there are so many goods in the shops, it makes my head spin." Elections the year after his accident led to eastern Europe's first post-communist government. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004. Mr Grzebski says he is alive thanks to his wife's constant care, after doctors gave him just two or three years to live. "It was Gertruda that saved me and I'll never forget it," he said. Mr Grzebski finds much to marvel at. "All these people who walk around with their mobile phones and never stop moaning," he said.

The 6.4-magnitude quake struck the county seat of Ning'er in Yunnan Province shortly after 5:30am. Among the dead was a five-year-old boy who was crushed by debris. The boy's parents were also trapped but were rescued by local residents. The quake affected 186,000 people in 35,000 households, many of whom moved to public areas as their homes collapsed or were damaged. The local seismic bureau recorded more than 300 aftershocks by 3:30pm. The strongest occurred shortly before 11am, registering 5.1 on the Richter scale. More than 70 mobile phone transmission stations were severely damaged, making cellular calls difficult. The county's power grid was also severely damaged, and two mid-sized reservoirs were cracked. Coal mines in Ning'er and surrounding areas were ordered to suspend operations, and workers were evacuated from underground, said Duan Liyuan, head of the provincial work safety bureau. The government of Pu'er City has allocated one million yuan (US$131,000) for emergency relief. The provincial civil affairs department is sending 2,000 tents, 2,000 quilts and 2,000 articles of clothing to the stricken area. The Ministry of Civil Affairs allotted 5,000 tents from the neighboring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The China Red Cross Society and its Yunnan branch sent a first batch of relief supplies worth 500,000 yuan, including tents, quilts, food and medicine. In a statement issued by the Central Committee of Chinese Communist Party and the State Council, President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice-Premier Hui Liangyu urged provincial government officials in Yunnan "to mobilize all resources available to treat the injured and minimize the loss of lives and property." They also asked local authorities to closely monitor aftershocks and take good care of residents affected by the disaster. A work group involving officials from the Ministry of Civil Affairs and several other government agencies arrived in the area last night. Ning'er County, covering 3,670 square kilometers, has a population of 190,000. Pu'er City, called "Simao" before it was renamed on April 8, is prone to strong earthquakes. It has experienced 20 tremors exceeding magnitude five since 1990. Pu'er, in Yunnan's southwest, borders Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar, covers 45,000 square kilometers and has a population of 2.6 million. Residents in Lincang City, about 200 kilometers from the epicenter, and the Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Xishuangbanna, 300 kilometers from the center, also felt the tremor.

The suicide attack, which occurred at a Turkish checkpoint, killing at least eight soldiers and leaving six wounded, is the latest in a series of terrorist attacks allegedly carried out by Kurdish militants. "We respect Iraq&#39;s territorial integrity but we cannot tolerate terrorist activities near our borders and on our territory," Abdullah Gul told an Ankara news conference after a meeting with EU officials. The EU apparently has given tacit support for Turkey&#39;s plans for a large military operation in the Kurdish-populated northern part of Iraq against armed members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Speaking after their meeting with Gul, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German foreign minister, and Olli Rehn, the EU enlargement commissioner, neither condemned nor openly supported the plan. Renh said, however, that the EU was definitely on Turkey&#39;s side where counterterrorism was concerned. The Turkish military have said up to 3,500 PKK gunmen based in Iraq were poised to commit terrorist attacks in Turkey, which encouraged the government to draft a petition to the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, asking him to exert pressure on Baghdad over the PKK&#39;s presence in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Turkish TV network NTV said the petition to be sent Monday would substantiate Ankara&#39;s claim that a military operation would be legal, citing Article 51 of the UN Charter on the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense by members. Last week Turkey&#39;s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to decide whether an operation would take place as soon as the military provided sufficient intelligence. "The ultimate decision on an operation is political. We will give consideration to whatever the military ask us to," he told Turkish media. Amid the Turkish military buildup near the Iraqi border in past weeks, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Massoud Barzani, head of the Kurdish administration in northern Iraq, said Sunday the Turks had bombed Iraqi territory in one of several pinpoint raids against PKK gunmen, a claim neither confirmed nor rejected by the Turkish General Staff. Over 40,000 people have been killed in Turkey since 1984 when PKK started its fight for an ethnic Kurdish state in the southeast of the country. Its charismatic leader Abdullah Ocalan has been imprisoned since 1999 on charges of terrorism narrowly escaping the death penalty because the EU, whose membership Turkey is seeking, has long lobbied against capital punishment. Since the 2003 U.S.-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Turkish separatist Kurds have received increasing, if unacknowledged, support from those living in the three neighboring provinces of oil-rich northern Iraq, whose population has sought autonomy from Baghdad and where local Peshmerga militia formally took over security functions from U.S. forces earlier this month. Ethnic Kurds have also been actively driving for autonomy in eastern parts of Syria. The borders between the three countries are still unsecured.

"This new attack which comes after many others clearly shows that there is no military way-out of the current situation," said Olli Rehn, acting EU Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, in a written statement. "Only an inclusive political settlement can put an end to the cycle of violence which has devastated the country over the last 16 years, and bring peace and stability," he added. The EC urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint and commit to a ceasefire, which remains a pre-condition for an effective National Reconciliation Congress due to start in mid-June. According to the EC press release, the EU's executive has been in direct contact with the key actors, notably the Transitional Federal Government, the leadership of the Hawiya clan in Mogadishu and the Ethiopian authorities to facilitate such a process. Earlier on Sunday, it was reported that at least six people were killed when a truck bomb exploded outside the residence of the interim Prime Minister Ghedi, who escaped the attack.

The attack, blamed on the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), came amid speculation Turkey may send troops into neighboring northern to crush Kurdish rebels based there, despite pleas from the United States to avoid military action. The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article Three people thought to belong to the PKK drove into the gendarmerie complex in the eastern province of Tunceli, opened fire and threw a grenade, killing eight and wounding six more. One guerrilla was also killed, the security sources said. The gendarmerie is a paramilitary force responsible for security in rural areas of Turkey. The attack, which security sources had earlier described as a suicide bombing, is the second big assault on Turkish forces in two weeks and will exacerbate political and security tensions in Turkey, which is preparing for elections in July. In a move one newspaper said may be an attempt to prepare the diplomatic ground for a possible army incursion into Iraq, a Foreign Ministry official said Turkey would submit a report to the United Nations this week spelling out its concerns about the PKK in Iraq and arguing a legal right to act against them. Turkey's permanent U.N. representative, Baki Ilkin, will also hold talks with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon this week, the official said. "First diplomacy," said Monday's headline in the Sabah newspaper, suggesting military action may not be far off. Turkey's powerful army General Staff says an operation in Iraq is necessary, and Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said last month he saw eye-to-eye with the military over possible action. Ankara has long urged U.S. and Iraqi government forces to crack down on an estimated 4,000 PKK guerrillas based in Iraq. But U.S. troops, battling an Arab insurgency in central and southern Iraq, are reluctant to intervene in the relatively peaceful, mainly Kurdish north of the country and have also asked Ankara to avoid military action. Turkey insists it has the right under international law to send troops into Iraq in self-defence if need be. It has long maintained a small low-profile contingent on the Iraqi side of the border, involved largely in reconnaissance, and complained last week that a unit had been harassed by local armed forces. Parliament must approve any extended major operation and the government has said no plans are currently under consideration. Senior officials of the European Union, which Turkey aims to join, said they had sought information about Turkish plans from Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul in talks in Ankara on Monday but said there was no suggestion an incursion was being planned. "Mr Gul told us the Turkish government naturally wants to protect its own people and that there is therefore a need to take action against terrorist activity," German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told a joint news conference with Gul. "I received no indication an action is planned with a view to a military intervention in northern Iraq," he said. The Iraq situation has fuelled a strong rise in nationalism and anti-American sentiment in Turkey ahead of July's elections. The Kurdish separatist campaign, in which some 30,000 people have been killed since 1984, is a major issue for many. 7 Turkish Troops Killed in Rebel Attack Gates Warns Turkey Not to Invade Iraq PKK Vows to Resist Any Turkish Incursion Silva Proposes Forest Preservation Plan Landslide Damages Famed Valley in Russia Related Topics & Web Content Top 35 Most Viewed Refinance Rates As Low As 2.9% - FREE QUOTES! $300,000 Mortgage for $965&frasl;mo!

The risks facing people included losing access to drinking water, and rising sea levels, the study concluded. The findings were published by the UN's Environment Programme (Unep). Unep chief Achim Steiner said the report showed that time was running out for political leaders to reach a global agreement on curbing emissions. Mr Steiner made his call for action at the launch of the UN Global Outlook for Ice and Snow report, which was being held in Tromso, Norway. Melting of snow and ice will in itself have severe consequences on nature and society "The report underlines that the fate of the world's snowy and icy places in a climatically challenged world should be cause for concern in every ministry, boardroom and living room across the world," he said. "The missing link is universal political action. Today's report should empower the public to take their leaders to task [and] should empower them to ask how much hotter it has to get before we act." The study warns of a range of threats that could destabilise ecosystems around the world, with potentially devastating consequences for hundreds of millions of people. Melting glaciers in Asia's mountains could affect an estimated 40% of the world's population, who rely on ice melt for crop irrigation and drinking water. It added that rising temperatures were already resulting in the thawing of permafrost in places such as Siberia. This was leading to the release into the atmosphere of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The fate of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, which hold almost all of the planet's freshwater ice, needed to be better understood, the UN publication urged. It said that if emissions of greenhouse gases continued unabated, the massive ice sheets were likely to become unstable as the world continued to warm. Without taking measures to mitigate sea level rise, an estimated 145 million people, primarily in Asia, would be exposed to the risk of flooding. The UN said that the International Polar Year, a 24-month global scientific study of the polar regions, would help shed light on how climate change is altering the ice dynamics in these regions. The authors also warned that less ice and snow cover was leading to more of the Sun's energy being absorbed by the land and the sea, rather than being reflected back into space. They said this "positive feedback" could accelerate global warming and result in more abrupt shifts in the climate. Norway's Environment Minister, Helen Bjoernoey, said the comprehensive study into the state of the world's snow and ice presented a bleak prognosis. "To me, it is particularly alarming to realise climate change can be a reinforcing process - global warming results in further global warming," the minister observed. "As documented in the report, melting of snow and ice will in itself have severe consequences on nature and society." E-mail this to a friend Find out how the greenhouse effect works and more...

A strong earthquake shook the hilly southwestern Chinese region near the Lao border early Sunday, killing at least three people, injuring hundreds and forcing 120,000 people from their homes, state media reported. (AP Photo) By ANITA CHANG Associated Press Writer BEIJING Jun 4, 2007 (AP) An earthquake in southwest China early Sunday left at least three people dead including a boy crushed by debris while injuring hundreds, destroying buildings, and forcing the evacuation of 120,000 residents, state media reported. The 6.4-magnitude quake struck the county seat of Ning'er shortly after 5:30 a.m., said China's official Xinhua News Agency, citing the government's seismological bureau. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the quake's magnitude at 6.2. At least three people died and more than 290 were injured, 15 seriously, Xinhua reported. One of the dead was a 5-year-old boy who was crushed by debris, state television reported. The boy's parents were also trapped but were rescued by local residents, China Central Television said. Residents said the initial quake lasted about a minute and that many residents fled their homes to find safety in open areas. Others moved into tents after their homes were damaged, said a retired schoolteacher who only gave her surname, Dong. "Many old buildings, especially those built in the 1970s, either have cracks in the walls or have collapsed," Dong told The Associated Press by phone. News footage aired on China Central Television showed partly collapsed brick homes and soldiers knocking down unstable structures. Doctors and nurses treated the injured in a large tent. Rescue teams with thousands of tents, quilts and other relief supplies were rushing to the area, Xinhua reported. The evacuation of 120,000 residents was ordered after many buildings were deemed to be unsafe, said an official with the bureau who gave only his surname, Ma. Between 20,000 to 30,000 of those people were living in tents, he said. Another official from the seismological bureau, who gave only his surname Ye, said the rest of the people were living without cover because of a shortage of tents. He said more tents were being sent from other areas. Ning'er lies in a quake-prone mountainous region in Yunnan province about 90 miles north of Laos and is famous for its strong tea, known as Pu'er. For centuries, the area sat astride an important trade route for tea and horses that ran along western China between central Asia and southeastern Asia. 3 Dead, Hundreds Injured in China Quake Comment on This Story WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts.

Guide My Times My Voice India, Brazil seek to boost trade [ MONDAY, JUNE 04, 2007 07:00:04 PM] NEW DELHI: Emerging economic powers India and Brazil pledged Monday to increase bilateral trade four-fold to 10 billion dollars in the next three years. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, on a visit to New Delhi, told business leaders that both countries could achieve not only the "target we have set, we could go beyond that." "We have decided to increase our trade from the present 2.4 billion dollars to 10 billion by 2010," said Lula, a goal endorsed by Indian trade minister Kamal Nath. "With a total population of 1.3 billion inhabitants, we have not even discovered 10 percent of our trade potential," said Lula, on his second visit to India since 2003. During a visit by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Brazil in September, Lula's administration promised to help New Delhi produce ethanol and cut its dependence on oil. Brazil is the largest producer and exporter of ethanol fuel, which is used by 80 percent of new cars sold in the country.

After three days of protracted negotiations with leaders of the Gujjar Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje said the talks had been “successful” and the samiti had agreed to withdraw its agitation. The three-member committee, to be headed by a retired Rajasthan High Court judge, would examine the norms laid down for Gujjars in their current status in the OBC category and consider their representation for inclusion in the ST list, Raje told a joint press conference with the leaders of the samiti, which had spearheaded the agitation since Tuesday last. The committee, which would have an expert on the issue of the Scheduled Tribe reservation as its secretary, would submit its report to the state government in three months, she said. “We have withdrawn our agitation. We regret the violence and the loss of life, including those of two policemen,” in the agitation, leaders of the samiti led by Col Kirori Singh Bainsla said. The Chief Minister also announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the families of all those killed in the violence. While 21 persons died in police firing and violence during the Gujjar agitation, five persons were killed in clashes between Gujjars and Meenas, who opposed the demand for the ST status. Meenas, who are in the ST category, had substantial representation in political parties and the government. Raje said the state government would move faster on the administrative and legal procedures on the issue of the Gujjar demand keeping in view the Centre’s norms and procedures. “The talks on the Gujjar demand of shifting them from OBC to the ST category were positive and fruitful and hurdles have been overcome. We have come to an understanding and found a solution through democratic means,” she told a crowded press conference at her official residence after six hours of parleys with the samiti leaders. A senior government official said 10-12 hours would be needed to restore normalcy in the state, which had witnessed large scale violence. In his response to the government decision to appoint the high-power committee, Rajasthan food minister and a Meena leader, K.L. Meena, said the government had not acceded to the Gujjars’ demand for a communication to the Centre on giving ST status to the community. “We had told the government that under no circumstances should it write to the Centre. The government has not written any letter. This is our victory,” he said. Reacting to the understanding, Gujjar leader and Congress MP Avtar Singh Bhadana said, “We have full faith that the committee will give recommendations in our favour”. Bainsla told the press conference that though the talks brought the “desired result”, it was most unfortunate that a number of protesters died during the agitation. “We withdraw agitation in the nation’s interest...I from the inner core of the heart express my apology to those killed and their relatives,” the Gujjar leader said. While Raje was assisted at today’s talks by health minister Digamber Singh at her official residence, the 11-member samiti was led by Bainsla. Roop Singh, a senior Gujjar leader, who was part of the 11-member samiti delegation for the talks, said “with this agreement we have saved thousands of lives”.

"Colonel Kirori Lal Bainsla has accepted the invitation and would hold talks with Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje later today in Jaipur," said Roop Singh, a Gujjar leader. Colonel Bainsla is the convenor of Gujjar Sangarsh Samiti that is spearheading the agitation and was invited by the chief minister on Saturday for talks. Earlier yesterday, the Gujjars cremated five members of their community who were killed in May 29 police firing in Patauli near Dausa. Meanwhile, the state continued to be calm for the second day. A seven-hour marathon meeting between Gujjar leaders and Raje on Saturday had remained "inconclusive". However, after the meeting, the chief minister had said that the talks on the reservation issue would continue. Raje also announced Rs500,000 as relief for the family of those killed in firing. "The injured would be provided suitable and necessary assistance," she added. The trouble started on Tuesday when a road blockade by the Gujjars to press their demand for Scheduled Tribe status, took a violent turn during which 14 people were killed in clashes with the police. Since the start of the agitation on May 29, at least 25 people have been reported killed in clashes.

Warns of Effects of Global Thaw | Chron.com - Houston Chronicle " width="11" height="11" border="0"> Legal & Public Notices Legal & Public Notices Legal & Public Notices Travel News & Features Legal & Public Notices June 4, 2007, 9:28AM U.N. Warns of Effects of Global Thaw By DOUG MELLGREN Associated Press Writer &copy; 2007 The Associated Press OSLO, Norway &mdash; Melting glaciers, ice sheets and snow cover could affect up to 40 percent of the world's population through rising sea levels, flooding and dwindling supplies of water for drinking and farming, a U.N. report said Monday. The study by about 70 scientists, released before Tuesday's World Environment Day, also highlighted the risk that the receding ice cover could accelerate global warming, because the icepacks cool the planet by reflecting heat into space. Even though much of the ice is in remote areas, such as polar regions and Greenland, the impact will be felt worldwide, U.N. Environment Program executive director Achim Steiner said. "The report underlines that the fate of the world's snowy and icy places in a climatically challenged world should be cause for concern in every ministry, boardroom and living room across the world," Steiner said. The report was released in the Norwegian Arctic city of Tromsoe, which is hosting the main international celebrations of World Environment Day under the theme "Melting ice _ a hot topic?" It builds on a series of reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released earlier this year. The report, called "The Global Outlook for Snow and Ice," said warmer temperatures could raise sea levels by 30-50 inches this century, which could flood low-lying areas and force millions to flee, such as in Bangladesh. Even those far from a coast could feel the impact, such as many as 1.5 billion people, mainly in Asia, who get their fresh water from the spring thaw of snow and ice. "An estimated 40 per cent of the world's population could be affected by loss of snow and glaciers on the mountains of Asia," the UNEP said. In the Northern Hemisphere, snow cover in March and April has declined 7-10 percent over the past 30 or 40 years, the report said. It said over the past 30 years, the extent of sea ice has declined 6-7 percent in winter and 10-12 percent in summer, while ice thickness has declined by at least 10-15 percent. The rate at which the Greenland ice sheet is melting has doubled over the past two or three years, and glaciers are receding in most of the world. "Melting of ice and snow will in itself have severe consequences on nature and society. But it will also reduce the reflection of sun beams from the surface of the Earth and in this way contribute to further global warming," Norwegian Environment Minister Helen Bjoernoey said. In addition to snow and ice free areas absorbing more heat, the melting of permafrost in places like Siberia could open new bodies of water, creating "thermokast lakes" that could release enormous amounts of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. Bjoernoey said she was especially worried by the idea that "Global warming results in further global warming." The report said people are already adapting to the change. In China, a railroad built on permafrost includes a cooling system to prevent melting that would undermine frozen ground under the tracks. Hunters in parts of Greenland have switched from traditional dogsleds to small boats because of changes in their ice. Events in Tromsoe began Sunday, with South African Bishop Desmond Tutu hosting an ecumenical church service, and last through Tuesday, with a climate conference.

"Of course I am an absolute and pure democrat... the tragedy is that I am the only one, there are simply no others in the world," he told foreign journalists ahead of this week's G8 summit in Germany, Kommersant reported. "Since the death of Mahatma Gandhi, there has been no one to talk to," he said, in an apparently ironic reference to the Indian independence leader who preached non-violence. "Look what is happening in North America. The horror: torture, homelessness, Guantanamo, imprisonment without a court or trial," he told foreign journalists on Friday. "Look what is happening in Europe: the harsh treatment of demonstrators, the use of rubber bullets, tear gas in one city and then the next, the murder of demonstrators in the streets." Police have been condemned for using tear gas against protesters in Germany ahead of Wednesday's summit, while Russia has accused Estonian police of a heavy-handed response to recent protests by ethnic Russians in Tallinn in which one protester died. "And I'm not even talking about the post-Soviet arena," Putin said. "There was one hope, in the guys in Ukraine, but they have completely discredited themselves and events are moving towards sheer tyranny". In recent months, Russia has been accused by the West of using special forces to clamp down on peaceful protesters in a wide-spread attack on pro-democracy groups in the country. The Group of Eight summit at the Heiligendamm resort on Germany's Baltic Sea coast will bring together the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States.

Taylor doesn&#39;t have sufficient legal resources to review material supplied by the prosecution and therefore is unable properly prepare his defense, his lawyer, Karim Khan, said today at the start of the trial at the UN&#39;s Special Court for Sierra Leone, which was shown live on the tribunal&#39;s Web site. Taylor pleaded innocent in April. ``I&#39;m driven to the conclusion that I will not receive a fair trial before the special court at this point,&#39;&#39; Taylor wrote in a letter Khan read during the proceedings. ``I must decline to attend any further hearings in this case until adequate time and facilities are provided to my defense team.&#39;&#39; Judge Julia Sebutinde said the trial will continue without Taylor. Taylor, 59, was indicted in connection with the 1991-2002 civil war in diamond-rich Sierra Leone, a West African nation that borders Liberia, which killed about 50,000 people. He faces 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including support for the Revolutionary United Front rebels, a group that trained drug-taking child soldiers who tortured, raped, and amputated the hands and feet of their civilian victims. Taylor was transferred to the Netherlands in June 2006 after being arrested in Nigeria, where he went into exile in 2003. The trial will last as long as 18 months and cost about $25 million, lead prosecutor Stephen Rapp said on Jan. 30. The U.K. has offered to imprison Taylor in the event he is found guilty.

The trial was ordered to continue anyway, and the chief prosecutor outlined the horrific murders and mutilations of thousands of civilians in neighboring Sierra Leone by forces allegedly under Taylor's control in 1991-2002.

VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article Defense lawyer Karim Khan said Taylor had fired him and wanted to act has his own attorney. Khan walked out even though the presiding judge repeatedly directed him to continue to represent Taylor, if only for the opening day. Apologizing and defying threats of contempt of court, Khan gathered his files and left. "This is not defense counsel making some cheap trick," Khan told The Associated Press outside court. Taylor "thought this was a railroad to a conviction and in those circumstances, he exercised his right to terminate my representation and to represent himself." In presenting his case, Chief Prosecutor Stephen Rapp told how attackers would randomly murder people and enslave others to use as fighters, miners and farmers, Rapp said. Then "the attackers would mutilate _ amputating arms, limbs, gouging eyes." Children were conscripted, and some were forced to kill their own parents, he added. Rapp said a judgment "will not bring back the dead from their graves, nor give back limbs to the thousands of amputees," but would give "some small measure of closure" to the people of Sierra Leone. Taylor, 59, has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court has no death sentence and no maximum sentence if he is convicted. The prosecution made a four-hour opening statement Monday, after which the case was adjourned for three weeks. It was unclear who would be sitting on the defense bench when it resumes June 25. The trial was expected to last 18 months. Taylor was not in court Monday, but in a letter read to judges by Khan, he claimed he had been prevented from seeing a court official mandated with making sure he is properly defended and that his one court-appointed attorney was heavily outgunned by the prosecution team of nine. "At one time I had confidence in this court's ability to dispense justice. Over time, it has become clear that confidence has been misplaced," Taylor's statement said. "I will not receive a fair trial."

He was due to meet with Afghan and military leaders to assess progress on stabilizing the country. Gates arrived in Afghanistan after attending a weekend conference on Asian security in Singapore. "I think actually things are slowly, cautiously headed in the right direction," Gates told reporters en route to Kabul. "I'm concerned to keep it moving that way." Gates's second visit since taking over the Pentagon in December is to assess coordination within the US-led forces and to try to ensure Afghanistan does not spiral into the kind of bloodletting seen in Iraq. Violence is growing in Afghanistan nearly six years after the US-led invasion. Bombings strike several times a week and NATO and the US forces report clashes with Taliban fighters nearly every day. US and NATO air strikes on Taliban positions have killed scores of civilians, provoking protests by Afghans and calls for President Hamid Karzai's resignation. But US officials say there is progress in Afghanistan and that NATO has scored successes in the country's volatile south during a spring offensive. Gates plans to meet Karzai and Afghan Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak as well as US-led forces' commanders. "One of my concerns is we have 42 countries and 12 NGOs out here and I want to find out if there's anyone really creating an overall strategy or coordinating their activities so that we can make the best possible use of the resources that are out here," Gates said. "There's a joint monitoring board that's supposed to do that and I want to find out if that's in fact performing as we had hoped." Gates is also likely to discuss shortfalls in the forces available to NATO and Afghan commanders. NATO needs about 3,000 more troops, mostly for police training -- a requirement alliance member states have failed to fill for months. The European Union in May promised to send about 160 police trainers, but that remains far below what commanders and senior US officials say is needed. Gates asked his Asian counterparts at a security conference in Singapore on Saturday for more military trainers and economic and governance assistance. He said Asian states seemed willing to consider more aid but no firm commitments were announced.

The army sent helicopter gunships and reinforcements to Tunceli province in southeastern Turkey after guerrillas rammed a vehicle into the military post and opened fire with automatic weapons and rockets, local media reported. Soldiers returned fire, killing the driver, the military said. The attack came as Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told European Union officials visiting Ankara that "we have every right to take measures against terrorist activities directed at us from northern Iraq." Turkey's political and military leaders have been debating whether to stage an incursion into northern Iraq to try to root out Kurdish rebel bases there. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose country holds the EU presidency, said he "did not get the impression that Turkey would stage an incursion." A pro-Kurdish news agency reported Monday that Turkish troops shelled a border area in northern Iraq for a second day in an attack on Kurdish rebels based there. Abdul-Rahman al-Chadarchi, a spokesman for the Kurdish rebel group PKK, told The Associated Press by telephone that there had been artillery shelling from Turkey into Iraqi territory at dawn, and that there had been simultaneous shelling from the Turkish and Iranian sides on Sunday night. "There were no casualties. Most of the shells landed in empty areas, valleys and farms. Turkish helicopters are conducting surveillance flights over Iraqi border lands," al-Chadarchi said. The report could not immediately be confirmed. The leader of the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq, Massoud Barzani, confirmed shelling by Turkish troops on Kurdish areas early Sunday but said there was no Turkish incursion. On Monday, the Belgium-based Firat news agency, citing Iraqi Kurdish sources, said Turkish artillery again targeted an area close to the border town of Zakho. On Sunday, the agency said the troops shelled the Hakurk area, farther east. Turkish authorities, who have called the Firat agency a mouthpiece of the main Kurdish rebel group, the PKK, were not immediately available to comment. Kurdish guerrillas have long had camps in the Hakurk area, nine miles from the Turkish border. Turkish troops have occasionally launched brief raids in pursuit of guerrillas in northern Iraq, and have sometimes shelled suspected rebel positions across the border. Turkish authorities rarely acknowledge such military operations, which were more frequent before the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Turkey has been building up its military forces on the Iraqi border in recent weeks, amid debate over whether to launch a cross border offensive to attack separatist rebels of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, known by its Kurdish acronym, PKK. The rebels stage raids in southeast Turkey after crossing over from hide-outs in Iraq and have escalated bomb attacks in the west of the country. Police arrested a suspected PKK rebel who allegedly staged last month's market bombing in the Aegean port of Izmir that killed one person and injured 15 others.

But 19 years later, and in circumstances uncannily similar to those portrayed in the film Goodbye Lenin, in which a man tries to hide the demise of East Germany from his mother who has recovered from a coma, he has awoken to a Poland far removed from the austere country he once knew. Jan Grzebski: Gertruda saved me, and I'll never forget it "When I went into a coma there was only tea and vinegar in the shops," said the 65-year-old railwayman who suffered an accident at work. "Meat was rationed and huge petrol queues were everywhere. Now I see people on the streets with cell phones and there are so many goods in the shops that it makes my head spin." Communism was relegated to the history books in 1989. Poland now boasts one of the strongest economies in the European Union, and ration books are found only in museums. An indication of the revolution that has swept the nation is that Gen Wojciech Jaruzelski, the country's last communist president, is due to stand trial soon for "communist crimes". Mr Grzebski said he has "no complaints about the new reality", but added that he was surprised by the way some people still moaned. He singled out for praise his wife, who remained convinced that he would recover one day. "It was Gertruda who saved me, and I'll never forget it," he said from his home in the north-eastern town of Dzialdowo. Dr Boguslaw Poniatowski, who monitored Mr Grzebski's condition, agreed. "For 19 years she did the job of an experienced intensive care team, changing her comatose husband's position every hour to prevent bed-sore infections," he said. His wife added that she had cried a lot and prayed a lot during her family's long ordeal. "People kept asking when he was going to die, but he is not dead," she said. Mr Grzebski said he vaguely recalls being taken to family gatherings while in his coma, as well as his wife and children trying to communicate with him. Along with changes to Poland, Mr Grzebski, who is still confined to a wheelchair, has also been confronted with a very different set of family circumstances. Back in 1988 he had four children - now he also has 11 grandchildren. Restaurant meal for one : 100 %, 2.5 % Post this story to: Top economist fears Bank of England has lost control.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai seemed to dismiss the matter. At a news conference at the presidential palace, Gates offered possible explanations for the flow of weapons from Iran to this war-scarred country, including smuggling. He mentioned no specific weapons, but NATO officials recently cited the discovery in Kabul of an armor-piercing roadside bomb, the same type U.S. officials have long complained are entering Iraq from Iran. ``There have been indications over the past few months of weapons coming in from Iran,'' Gates told reporters with Karzai at his side. ``We do not have any information about whether the government of Iran is supporting this, is behind it, or whether it's smuggling.'' Gates, on his second visit to Afghanistan since becoming Pentagon chief last December, said that while the weapons appear to be going to Taliban fighters, some may be headed to criminals in the Afghan drug trade. Asked his own view, Karzai appeared eager to give the Iranian government a pass. He said there was no evidence of Iranian government involvement, adding, ``Iran and Afghanistan have never been as friendly as they are today.'' There is no reason for Iran to aid the Taliban, Karzai said. ``It is in the interests of our brothers in Iran'' to support the development of a more stable and prosperous Afghanistan. He said that also applied to Pakistan, on Afghanistan's eastern border, where U.S. officials say Taliban fighters have found haven and easy passage for cross-border attacks on U.S., NATO and Afghan troops. A prevalent view among U.S. officials is that Tehran, while not an ally of the Taliban, is seizing any feasible opportunity in both Iraq and Afghanistan to complicate U.S. stabilization efforts and to tie down the American military amid tensions between Tehran and Washington over Iran's nuclear program. Later, Gates flew to Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, at the heart of the fight against the Taliban, where he conferred privately with U.S. and NATO commanders. Afterward he flew to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan to meet with government officials on Tuesday. Before the Kabul news conference, Gates flew by helicopter to Camp Morehead, a sparse military outpost ringed by mountain peaks several miles outside Kabul. American and French special forces there are training Afghan commandos in stealthy operations U.S. officials believe are crucial to undermining the Taliban. The first class of recruits is four weeks into its 12-week course. At Morehead, Gates met Gen. Bismullah Khan, one of the most well-known of the former mujahadeen fighters from the days of Soviet occupation. The general, now head of the Afghan National Army, gave Gates a large book that he said featured descriptions of battlefield exploits by Ahmed Shah Massoud, who played a leading role in driving the Soviet occupation army out of Afghanistan. Massoud, later an Afghan minister of defense, was assassinated by al-Qaida agents two days before the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In an interview with reporters traveling with Gates, Khan said he is pushing the U.S. to accelerate the training and equipping of the Afghan National Army to hasten the day when it can fight the Taliban without relying on U.S. air and ground support. ``The problem we have is that we are not able to conduct operations independently,'' Khan said through an interpreter. He cited specifically a lack of Afghan air support and the kind of ``direct fire'' support provided by tanks. ``We are looking forward to the day when we can fight the enemy independently.'' The general was asked how soon he thought his forces could function without U.S. military support. ``We ask for it to be as soon as possible,'' he replied. ``I will ask the secretary of defense to expedite the (training and equipping) process so we can do this. The only way to defeat the enemy is to become independent.'' The U.S. is committed to training and equipping an Afghan army of 70,000 soldiers, hoping to reach that figure by December 2008. ``It's not going to be enough,'' Khan said. ``We will ask for more.''
