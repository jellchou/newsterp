In Berlin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested the U.S. was destabilizing the situation in Lebanon by shipping weapons to the army for its fight against the militants _ drawing a pointed rebuke from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

Heavy clashes between the Lebanese army and al-Qaida-linked Islamic militants broke a weeklong truce as Lebanon's government stressed its determination to defeat the terrorists but said it was willing to give mediation a chance to end the fighting at a Palestinian refugee camp. (AP Photo/Nasser Nasser) (Nasser Nasser - AP) The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article The Lebanese military has been fighting Fatah Islam militants at the Nahr el-Bared refugee camp in northern Lebanon since May 20. The camp is ringed by hundreds of soldiers backed by artillery and tanks in place to storm the camp. Fatah Islam has claimed to have more than 500 fighters with automatic weapons, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades inside the camp. The Lebanese government has vowed to crush the militants. Fighting between the army and militants resumed shortly after sunset Wednesday at the camp on the outskirts of the port city of Tripoli. Army artillery blasted militant positions inside the camp to silence the source of fire. There was no immediate word on casualties. Several Fatah Islam suspects have been arrested in army raids on apartments in Tripoli in the past two weeks. It was not clear where the 20 militants were arrested. The 20 included 18 Lebanese, a nonnative Lebanese and a Syrian. All were charged with committing terrorist acts that resulted in the deaths of soldiers and civilians, the officials said. The charges against them also include forming a gang with the aim of committing crimes against the people and undermining state authority. All 20 are in custody and if convicted, they could face the death penalty. Sporadic gunfire exchanges have continued daily since a truce halted three days of heavy fighting. But renewed fighting that began before sundown Tuesday was the worst outbreak in violence in a week. Lebanese army artillery pounded positions on the northern edge of the camp and near the Mediterranean coastline, apparently to prevent militants from fleeing. Since the fighting began, 31 soldiers, 20 civilians and about 60 militants have been killed. Thousands of Palestinians have fled the camp but thousands more are still inside, along with hundreds of fighters. The standoff has raised concerns of more violence across Lebanon, which has 12 Palestinian refugee camps and various armed groups. The U.S. has airlifted planeloads of military supplies to Beirut to support the Lebanese troops in their battle with the militants. Lavrov, speaking at a news conference of the Quartet of Middle East peace negotiators in Berlin, was asked about the shipments and responded with a remark about "the necessity of avoiding weapons supplies that could destabilize the situation." Rice, sitting just to his right at the German Foreign Ministry, responded quickly that the U.S. was attempting to help rebuild the Lebanese army so it can defend the country against armed groups. "The rebuilding of the Lebanese army is envisioned in any number of international agreements ... and that is what we are doing," Rice said. "We are supporting the Lebanese army, which is an all-Lebanese institution. It's not a matter of interfering in Lebanese affairs, it's an effort to help Lebanon to defend its own sovereignty." U.S. arms are a sensitive issue in a nation deeply divided between supporters of Prime Minister Fuad Saniora's government and an opposition backed by America's Mideast foes, and Syria. The opposition led by the Shiite Islamic militant group Hezbollah accuses Saniora of being too close to Washington.

Malaysian court throws out appeal in key ruling on Islam Putrajaya, May 30: Malaysia's highest court on Wednesday threw out a bid by a woman seeking to have her conversion to Christianity from Islam officially recognised. A three-judge panel of the Federal Court rejected an appeal by Lina Joy in a case that went to the heart of a debate here on whether civil courts should take precedence over tribunals based on Islamic sharia law. Joy's appeal centred on whether she should be required to go before a sharia court to have her renunciation -- seen as one of the gravest sins in Islam -- recognised before authorities delete the word "Islam" from her identity card. Chief Judge Ahmad Fairuz said the National Registration Department, which is in charge of issuing identity cards, had the right to demand that a sharia court certify Joy's conversion. "On the question that the National Registration Department has the right to demand a certification from the Islamic court that confirms the appellant's renunciation of Islam, my answer is that NRD has the right," the judge said. "The appeal has been rejected with cause." *Your friend's e-mail address: 7 NATO soldiers killed in Afghan crash No breakthrough on resumption of six-party talks on North Korea Shimon Peres announces Israeli presidency bid Al Gore flays American citizens for Bush`s policies Yahoo!

Yaþar Büyükanýt said a military operation in northern Iraq is necessary and they wait for a relevant decision to be made by political mechanism. While the heaviest military build-up of recent years goes on in the Iraq border in eastern Turkey, preparations for a possible operation were launched. The retired general at a key post to provide cooperation and communication between Turkey and the U.S. regarding the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party's (PKK) terror, removed from office by the government. Last week's suicide bombing in Ankara and confessions of terrorists caught in numerous cities in this process strengthened the conviction that the PKK targets big cities. The violation of Turkish airspace last week by two U.S. F 16s created the impression that the government and armed forces are at odds. And finally, Kurdish administrators in northern Iraq made statements in the meaning “Turkish tanks cannot find way to these lands.” Operation by press releases?: Undoubtedly the key issue needs to be clarified here is the situation that produces reservations about politics-military relations and confuses the minds. By all means, neither from the military nor the politics perspective sharing thoughts about an imaginary military operation through press releases is normal. It is even needless to say that this is against the traditions of Turkish Army and the general principles of military professional. And only to know this requires a deduction that something is odd, there is something unusual. If you ask, what is “unusual”, my answer would be: The U.S. factor&#8230; Let me elaborate this a bit more: In the good old days, “Army to Iraq” meant a “hot pursue” or a “cross border operation”. And in legal perspective, all military operations before the U.S. invasion in Iraq were held by the approval of Baghdad and in the frame of mutual agreement with the neighboring country. But now, the situation has changed. Neither the approval of Baghdad nor of Washington is the point at issue. To the opposite, statements made by both capitals give the impression of an objection and even an implicit/explicit threat against Turkey. Therefore regardless of the decision by political body in Ankara depends on the ground of “terror” it will blatantly have the characteristic of a “declaration of war”. Intervention at all odds?: Let me get to the point. I am of the opinion that the public impression of a communication break down between the military and the politics stems from that the Turkish army will be facing the U.S. forces in northern Iraq. Because the presence of Kurdish peshmerga in northern Iraq does not justify who the dominant power is in the region. Therefore it is reasonable to explain the limped communication between the Turkish Armed Forces and the government by the desire to reach a prompt conclusion in the diplomatic initiatives with Washington. Observation of escalating desire “intervention at all odds” in the Turkish army might strengthen the hands of foreign affairs having hard time to express itself in Washington. But if you ask the question whether the army will enter Iraq, the answer of course will be it is possible if suicide bombings similar to the one in Ankara continue. Apparently as long as the investigation about the suicide attack of Anafartalar Avenue in Ankara is in progress, opportunities will rise to make some new assessments beyond clarifying the incident as an attack by the PKK. I previously mentioned that there are some groups in Washington making calculations to provoke Turkish military and dragging it into the quagmire in Iraq. And the military will be worn out in a “nightmare period”, civilian decision making mechanism will be strengthened etc&#8230; I hope we will not end up loses because of the incertitude originates from election and politics discussions. The realm of the state cannot afford the games of “pretends”&#8230; &copy; 2005 Dogan Daily News Inc.

Yasar Buyukanit Thursday criticized some countries for supporting the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported. "There are countries supporting directly or indirectly PKK terrorism, among our allies," affirmed Buyukanit at an international symposium on "New Dimensions of Security and International Organizations," without specifying the countries. "Land mines used in and explosives such as C4, A3, A4 which are used in every murder in Turkey are not bought from supermarkets," Buyukanit said. "Countries (backing terrorism for political purposes) use double standard in combatting terrorism, and turn a blind eye to activities of persons or organizations that do not stage terrorist attacks on their own territories," Buyukanit stated. Buyukanit added that those who extend financial, logistical and propagandist support to terrorists should be deemed as terrorist. Buyukanit said there is a need for global cooperation against terrorism, reiterating that Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) are ready for international cooperation and solidarity, and sharing information and intelligence regarding security issues. An efficient international cooperation in fight against terrorism is only possible under the banner of the UN, Buyukanit said. In a bid to get rid of the threats of PKK, Turkey has recently warned that Turkish troops would launch a cross-border operation into northern in fighting against the outlawed Kurdish group. "We have earlier stated that there was a need for a cross- border operation into northern Iraq," said Buyukanit, adding " necessary planning can be made after political targets are determined." On May 22, a suicide bomb blast ripped through a crowded shopping center in the Ulus district of Turkish capital Ankara, killing seven, including the bomber, and injuring some 100 others. Officials believed the PKK was behind the attack. PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by the and the European Union, launched an armed campaign for an ethnic homeland in the mainly Kurdish southeastern Turkey in 1984, sparking decades of strife that has claimed more than 30,000 lives. The intensity of the fighting eased after PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured and imprisoned in 1999, but flared up again in recent years.

Many refugees, however, oppose the plan because of fears that it might allow the full-scale destruction of Nahr al-Bared and prevent them from returning to their homes. Finding alternative shelter for the estimated 15,000 displaced Palestinians in Beddawi is critical, because the camp has seen its population double in the past week, said UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) spokeswoman Hoda Samra. "It's critical for us at this stage to look into an alternative shelter to relieve some of the congestion in the camp, because we are talking about thousands of people now," she said on Wednesday. "It's just too overcrowded. "There is huge pressure on the water and electricity networks, and they can't sustain this amount of people." Although the details have yet to be worked out, UNRWA will most likely put up prefabricated accommodations on the edge of Beddawi and install mobile generators, portable showers, toilets and water tanks, Samra added. UNRWA has not yet estimated the number of families to be housed there. Nahr al-Bared refugees demonstrated in Beddawi on Tuesday for the right to return to their homes. "When we left the camp, we decided to stay one or two days and then return to Nahr al-Bared, but they don't want us to go back because they want to destroy it," Ashraf abu-Khourz said on the phone from Beddawi. "The situation [in Nahr al-Bared] was bad when we left, and now it has become worse. People don't want to stay here. More than 20,000 people came here and Beddawi is small - there are no places to sleep or bathe. We are Muslims, and there are eight families in one classroom. Men are sleeping in the streets because they won't sleep in schools with women." The rising number of checkpoints is preventing many Palestinian students from North Lebanon from traveling to university for final exams, because residents of Beddawi and Nahr al-Bared have been detained by security forces and sometimes arrested for suspected ties to Fatah al-Islam militants, said Khourz. Huda al-Turk, another UNRWA spokeswoman working in Beddawi, said moving the displaced to temporary housing units on the outskirts of the camp is one of many solutions being debated. "So far we are still looking into other alternatives," Turk said in a phone interview from Beddawi, but she declined to give details. Beddawi, however, will not be able to sustain the current arrangement for much longer. "There is not enough space in the schools, and it is increasing the economic burden of hosting families," Turk said. "We are OK for food supplies now - even host families are receiving assistance. The critical issue is clothing now, because everyone left with nothing." The fighting has also entirely paralyzed the education systems of both camps. Finding alternative shelter for the displaced currently living in UNRWA schools in Beddawi would allow children to finish classes for the year, said Yasser Daoud, a former Nahr al-Bared resident and field worker for the NGO Nebaah in Tyre. "[The plan] is good, because the children from Nahr al-Bared and Beddawi will be able to go to school again, but people are afraid that if this type of camp is established, it will become permanent," said Daoud. Daoud has heard from other humanitarian agencies that 2,000 residences in Nahr al-Bared have already been demolished, though no formal assessment has been made because access to the camp is still restricted. "My mother, sister, and brother are still in Nahr al-Bared because they don't want to repeat what happened to them in 1948," Daoud said. "I'm worried that something will happen to them if they stay, but they feel comforted that they are at least at home." Though Nahr al-Bared residents - both those in Beddawi and those who remain in the camp - are increasingly vulnerable, with memories of the razing of the Tal al-Zaatar still fresh in their minds, another Nakba - as the catastrophe of 1948 is called - is a fate far worse than violence or living in a temporary shelter, said the head of Hamas for North Lebanon, Abu Rabih al-Chehabi. "After the Nakba of 1948, many Palestinians decided never to leave their homes again out of fear they might not return," he said. "The 20,000 people who stayed in Nahr al-Bared remember what happened then." Tags: Children, Oman, Palestinian Send to a friend Save to My Web Your feedback is important to us!

But as Ron Corben reports from Bangkok, the party faithful have vowed to press on, raising fears of unrest. Thaksin Shinawatra react verdict in London, 30 May 2007 Thaksin Shinawatra, now living in London, called for Thailand's military and government to hold general elections soon. He also urged Thai Rak Thai Party members to accept the constitutional tribunal's verdict. Late Wednesday, the constitutional tribunal ordered the party Mr. Thaksin set up in 1998 to be dissolved. The judges banned more than 100 of its executives from politics for five years. Thai Rak Thai or Thai Love Thai Party, was found guilty of election violations and bribery during the inconclusive April 2006 general election, which was later annulled. Jakrapob Penkair, who had served as a Thaksin government spokesman, said the former prime minister considers the verdict too harsh. "Khun [Mr.] Thaksin expressed deep regret that the result has come this way. He himself said that it should not have been this severe. It is up to the [party] members in Thailand itself to fight for rights," said Penkair. "All I can say is that members of Thai Rak Thai will not lay down and take it." Jakrapob accuses the tribunal of issuing a political rather than legal verdict. Party officials say they will appeal. Mr. Thaksin's government was widely popular in rural areas, but was increasingly unpopular among the middle class. After nearly a year of anti-Thaksin protests in Bangkok, the military ousted Mr. Thaksin last September and appointed an interim government, which filed election fraud charges against both his Thai Rak Thai party and the leading opposition group. The government has heightened security around the country. Protests against the verdict are expected in the northeastern provinces, which are Thai Rak Thai strongholds. In Bangkok, party supporters planned a rally Thursday. The Democrat Party, which the tribunal cleared of election fraud charges, called for reconciliation. Media reports and political analysts say the ruling leaves the Democrats in a stronger position when elections are eventually held. The military and the interim government have said elections will be held after a new constitution is drafted, probably before the end of the year. Chulalongkorn University professor Somphob Manaragsan says the verdict should help the country move forward. "There is some clearer picture of the Thai political economic development after one of the deadlocks has been broken through," said Manaragsan. "I think that was a very important step." Somphob also says the public generally considers the tribunal to have been a legitimate way to resolve conflict in the country. But he doubts its verdict will end Mr. Thaksin's political aspirations. Other analysts say party members believe the tribunal discriminated against them, raising fears that deep political divides will remain.

Earlier Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has pledged his support for any military decision to stage an incursion into Iraq, said the army had not yet asked parliament for permission.

Yasar Buyukanit said he had asked for approval during a news conference on April 12, when he said "an operation into Iraq is necessary." "We have told both Turkey and the world on April 12 that as soldiers, we are ready," Buyukanit said Thursday. Buyukanit's remarks appeared to put Erdogan's government under pressure to seek approval from parliament to send soldiers into Iraq to fight separatist Kurdish guerrillas. The rebels have long used northern Iraq as a base in their campaign for self-rule in southeast Turkey. The United States opposes any unilateral Turkish military action, fearing it could destabilize northern Iraq _ the calmest part of the country. Massoud Barzani, the leader of the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq, also strongly opposes a Turkish incursion and has threatened to confront Turkish soldiers if they enter northern Iraq. Military trucks hauled more tanks and guns to the border area Thursday, local reporters said. For weeks, TV stations have broadcast images of military trucks rumbling along the remote border, and trains transferring tanks and guns to bolster an already formidable force in the area. The U.S. State Department said Wednesday that it has seen nothing to substantiate reports of a significant movement of Turkish military forces to the border. Buyukanit said the government needed to define the political targets of such an operation, referring to Barzani. "Political authorities will determine the targets," Buyukanit said. "Are we going to struggle with the PKK once we enter there or do something with Barzani too?" he said, referring to the main Kurdish separatist group.

The U.S. has led a campaign to isolate Iran to dissuade it from building nuclear weapons. Iran, which says it is enriching uranium for peaceful purposes, triggered a new round of talks over further penalties last week by failing to comply with demands made by the United Nations Security Council in March. ``Should Iran continue not to heed the call of the Security Council, we shall support further appropriate measures as agreed,&#39;&#39; German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said today on behalf of the G-8 after a meeting of foreign ministers in Potsdam, Germany. The last set of sanctions included a freezing of assets of a state-owned Iranian bank, limits on arms sales and the imposition of penalties on some military commanders. The European Union&#39;s foreign policy chief is set to hold his second meeting in just over a month with Iran&#39;s top nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, in Madrid tomorrow, a day before Rice arrives in the Spanish capital for meetings there. ``We remain committed to a negotiated solution which would address the international concerns over Iran&#39;s nuclear program and are united in our commitment to see the proliferation implications of Iran&#39;s nuclear program resolved,&#39;&#39; Steinmeier said in the statement. G-8 heads of state and government will discuss the matter further at a summit next week in the resort town of Heiligendamm, Germany. Rice now faces the task of persuading Russia and China to back tougher sanctions at the UN Security Council, where they wield veto power along with the U.S., Britain and France. The effort may be made more difficult by squabbling between Russia, on one side, and the U.S. and Western Europe, on the other. Russia objects to a U.S. plan to base interceptor missiles in Poland and a related radar system in the Czech Republic as a line of defense against any future missile strike from Iran. Russian President Vladimir Putin has characterized the so-called missile shield as a threat to Russia. Rice, noting that Putin said yesterday that Russia&#39;s ballistic missiles ``can destroy any missile shield we might build,&#39;&#39; added: ``We agree.&#39;&#39; Speaking at the same press conference, Lavrov shot back: ``I hope that nobody has to actually prove that Condi&#39;s right about that.&#39;&#39; A senior State Department official later told reporters that Russia couldn&#39;t assert that its ballistic missiles could overcome the interceptors planned by the U.S., while also saying the shield poses a threat to its deterrent. On Kosovo, the U.S. and European partners are seeking to pass a plan on Kosovo&#39;s future status by UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari through the Security Council. The U.S. has said that delaying Kosovo&#39;s independence risks igniting a new war in the Balkans, while Russia backs Serbia&#39;s stance of offering broad autonomy. ``This is an issue on which our positions are diametrically opposed,&#39;&#39; Lavrov said. ``At the moment I don&#39;t see any chance of the positions moving toward each other.&#39;&#39; As German Foreign Minister Steinmeier tried to end the press conference, Rice unexpectedly interrupted to announce a July 1-2 meeting between Putin and Bush in Maine. In a bid to end things on a lighter note, Rice challenged Lavrov to correctly pronounce ``Kennebunkport,&#39;&#39; the oceanside Maine town where the meeting will be held and where President George W. Bush&#39;s family vacations. Lavrov, a fluent English speaker, did so, and added that the Kennebunkport meeting would be an opportunity for the two leaders to discuss all the areas on which they ``do not agree.&#39;&#39; On the sidelines of the G-8 foreign ministers meeting in Potsdam, members of the Middle East peacemaking body known as the Quartet urged Palestinians to resume a cease-fire. Israel has been pummeled by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip in recent weeks and has responded with military attacks that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said today would continue. The Quartet principals included Rice, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and European Commissioner for External Relations Benita Ferrero- Waldner. The group announced they would travel to the Middle East next month to meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders and with representatives of the Arab League.

Kate and Gerry McCann broke down in tears before being comforted by Benedict XVI at the Vatican. The couple, both Catholics, said they hoped their meeting would help in the search for four-year-old Madeleine and that it had made them stronger. They met the Pope after attending his weekly general audience in St Peter's Square with more than 35,000 people. As they waited to speak to the Pope, the tears fell from Kate - who was clutching black rosary beads and her missing daughter's favourite toy, Cuddle Cat. When their time came, the Pope took Kate's hands and then Gerry bowed his head and kissed his hand. The couple, in dark suits, had a few words with the Pope before he blessed a photograph ofMadeleine. Kate showed him another picture of Madeleine alongside two-year-old twins Sean and Amelie. A clearly moved Pope then put his arm around Kate and gave her five rosary beads. The couple both wore green and yellow ribbons - symbols of hope in Portugal where Madeleine vanished during a holiday in Praia da Luz on May 3. Kate said later: "He was very kind and sincere. He said he would pray for us and our family and that he continued to pray for Madeleine's safe return to us. "I thanked him for letting us meet him and I thanked him for his prayers. It was a lovely day. "It was a very positive experience. I think it has only made us stronger and lifted us up more." During the ceremony, a red admiral butterfly landed on the yellow ribbon in Kate's hair, she said. It flew off then settled on her lapel. Kate said: "It was really strange but lovely, it was like a symbol of hope." Gerry said: "Meeting the pontiff was an experience that had very mixed emotions for us. In ordinary circumstances, it would be a highlight for any Catholic to meet the Pope. "But, of course, it was saddened by the very marked realisation that our daughter is still missing. "We know people everywhere are praying for our daughter and that helps us sustain our belief that we can get her back safely. "It was more personal than I could ever have imagined. There was recognition immediately when he looked at Madeleine's photo. "His touch and thoughts and words were more tender than I could have thought. That will help sustain us through this most difficult time." During the two-hour service before they met Benedict, Kate and Glasgowborn Gerry began crying when a priest said a prayer on behalf of the Pope. It read: "In a special way, his blessing goes to your children and loved ones." The couple's sad appearance was at odds with traditional scenes of celebration in the square. As the McCanns left, clergymen applauded them. Gerry said later: "One evil act, the abduction ofMadeleine, seems to have generated so much good. It has restored my faith in humanity. The couple, of Rothley, Leicestershire, are due to visit Spain, the Netherlands, Morocco and Germany to raise awareness of her disappearance. Gerry said: "We're still in the middle of a race but we do not know how long it is going to be. "We had the same feeling as though Madeleine had died - anguish, despair and torment. But Madeleine is not dead." Kate added: "The first 72 hours were the worst for both of us. It was hard at that point to get away from the dark places. "But as time goes on the support we've had and the prayers give us strength and hope. We are more positive." Kate said it was difficult when their twins Sean and Amelie - who stayed with family in the Algarve while their parents went to Rome - ask about their big sister. She said: "We do not want them to be upset about what has happened but we don't want them to forget her. "She could just walk back through the door. But as the days go on it becomes more difficult." The couple flew to Rome from Portugal on Top Shop tycoon Sir Philip Green's private jet. Postal unions across Europe yesterday asked delivery workers to be vigilant for Madeleine. He said that he continued to pray for Madeleine's safe return to us' function newPrintableWindow(objectid,path) { popUpWindow = window.open(path+'?objectid='+objectid+'&siteid=66633', 'Article', 'width=450,height=500,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,location=no,menubar=yes'); popUpWindow.focus(); } Email to a friend

The U.S. military said only one policeman was killed and eight were wounded. U.S. forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al-Qaeda gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. The American military also reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed Wednesday in a roadside bombing in Baghdad and one who died of wounds from a roadside bomb attack northwest of the capital Tuesday. At least 122 American forces have died in May, the third-deadliest month of the Iraq conflict. U.S. forces also continued a search for five Britons who were kidnapped Tuesday in Baghdad, as well as for two of its soldiers who have been missing since a May 12 ambush south of the capital. The Fallujah suicide bomber killed at least 10 policemen in the attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. The rest of the dead were civilians, many of them in line seeking jobs as policemen. He said as many as 50 were wounded. Fallujah General Hospital had received 15 bodies and 10 wounded, according to a doctor there, who would not allow the use of his name because he feared retribution. The physician said he believed other casualties were taken to the nearby Jordanian Hospital and private clinics. A member of the Fallujah city council, who also asked for anonymity for fear of attack by insurgents, said there were at least 20 killed and 25 injured. The coordination of information in Fallujah was particularly difficult because the mobile telephone system has been working only sporadically. Maj. Jeff Pool of the Multi-National Force-West said the Anbar province governor's office and the provincial police put the total number of dead at one Iraqi policeman, with six police and two civilians wounded in Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated explosives in his vest at the third of four checkpoints, standing among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only opened Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The U.S. military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaeda. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of Sunni insurgents and al-Qaeda throughout the war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents called for U.S. help. Members of al-Qaeda, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final exams, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from al-Qaeda. Clashes continued into the afternoon, and the council official said the al-Qaeda leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the U.S. military. U.S. forces, meanwhile, pressed on with the search for five kidnapped Britons, and a procession of mourners, some of them women wailing and beating their chests, marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a U.S. helicopter strike before dawn. The U.S. military said it had no report of airstrikes in Sadr City and that there were no civilian casualties in the second day of a search for the Britons, who were abducted Tuesday from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad. A U.S. military statement, however, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. AP Television News videotape from Sadr City showed the coffins of the victims atop a small bus with men and women walking behind, crying. A young boy could be seen sitting next to the coffins. A car in the area was punctured with big holes, as if hit by an airstrike. A police officer in Sadr City, who refused to allow use of his name because he feared retribution, said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 a.m., killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home &#8212; a common practice in Iraq's extreme heat through late spring and summer. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was wounded. Also in Sadr City raids, which the U.S. has been conducting with a select unit of Iraqi army forces, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi claimed his home was raided and ransacked by American forces at 3 a.m. Thursday. The military said it had no report of the incident. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. Dozens of U.S. Humvees and Bradley fighting vehicles had taken up positions around Sadr City at nightfall Wednesday. The five kidnapped Britons included four bodyguards working for the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld and one employee of BearingPoint, a U.S.-based management consulting firm. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. The Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaeda front group, claimed responsibility. Wiggins also said that more than 100 patrols a day were being launched to search for two missing troops who vanished after a May 12 ambush near Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. Four Americans and one Iraqi soldier were killed in the attack and the body of another American was later found in the Euphrates River. "Our determination and resolve to locate our missing soldiers is unwavering," Wiggins said. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Originally submitted May 11, the Kosovo draft resolution based on the plan by UN envoy Marti Ahtisaari to grant the Albanian-dominated region independence is backed by the United States and the European Union, but has met strong opposition from Serbia and Russia. The UN Security Council is set to hold consultations, including on a new draft resolution on Kosovo, Alejandro Wolff said without specifying what concessions were made by the authors of the earlier draft. Speaking at a news conference following a foreign ministerial meeting of the Group of Eight countries in Germany Wednesday, Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated that the solution should be based on a compromise between Kosovo and Belgrade and urged compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244. Adopted in 1999, Resolution 1244 determined to resolve the grave humanitarian situation in Kosovo and to provide for the safe and free return of all refugees and displaced persons to their homes, a requirement still far from being fulfilled. Kosovo, which has a population of two million, has been a UN protectorate since NATO&#39;s 78-day bombing campaign against the former Yugoslavia ended a war between Serb forces and Muslim Albanian separatists in 1999. While the Albanians have since demanded full independence, the sizeable Orthodox Serb minority has complained that their lives and holy places would be at risk under the proposed setup. Russia is a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, but Lavrov said he did not expect a veto would be necessary for the UN Security Council resolution on Kosovo.

Photo: Emilio Morenatti/AP A British soldier was among at least seven Nato troops killed when a helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan last night in an attack that appears to have prompted a bloody retaliation by Nato today. Nato said other troops rushing to the scene were ambushed and had to call in air support "to eliminate the enemy threat". Today the Afghan defence ministry claimed that dozens of Taliban were killed and wounded in a Nato raid in southern Helmand, close to where the helicopter came down. Earlier officials said seven soldiers had been killed in the helicopter - its five-strong US crew, plus its two military passengers, a Canadian and a Briton. Nato said the CH-47 Chinook may have been brought down by the Taliban but the cause was "being determined by military officials". Major John Thomas, a spokesman for Nato's international security assistance force, said: "It was a hostile area where the helicopter went down and initial indications are that enemy fire may have brought down the helicopter." The Taliban said it had carried out the attack, and claimed that 35 Nato troops had been killed. Taliban spokesman Qari Muhammad Yousuf said the death toll had been drawn from secret sources operating in Helmand. Speaking to Reuters, he said: "Mujahideen planned to ambush their convoy. But the helicopter appeared before the arrival of the convoy. The mujahideen fired on it with whatever they had." Initial reports suggested the helicopter had been hit with a rocket-propelled grenade. There were no survivors. The fact that it was flying at night suggested the aircraft might have been carrying troops on a night-time air assault. The Taliban spokesman claimed that militants had shot the helicopter down in the Kajaki district of southern Helmand. Kajaki is the site of a large US-funded hydroelectric dam now being repaired so it can provide electricity to the southern city of Kandahar. British troops, who make up the bulk of the forces in Helmand province, have been engaged in fierce fighting around the dam. The latest British death brings the toll of fatalities among British forces personnel in Afghanistan since the start of operations in November 2001 to 58. Of these, 34 were killed in action, while 23 are known to have died either as a result of illness, non-combat injuries or accidents. The Ministry of Defence this week named Corporal Darren Bonner as the soldier killed on Monday when an explosion hit a British convoy in the Gereshk region of Helmand province. The CH-47, a heavy transport helicopter with two rotors, can carry around 40 soldiers plus a small crew. Maj Thomas said the wreckage of last night's crash remains on the site, which has been secured by Nato troops. "There will be a full investigation," he said. "We will try to determine everything that happened and to fully investigate the site." The MoD confirmed that a British soldier had been killed and that the next of kin are being informed. There are more than 3,000 British soldiers currently serving in Afghanistan. The Nato force, which is responsible for a countrywide counter-insurgency campaign, has 37,000 soldiers, including a 14,000-strong US contingent. There have been a number of helicopter crashes in Afghanistan since 2001. A Chinook crashed in February in the southern province of Zabul, killing eight US personnel. Officials ruled out enemy fire as the cause. In May 2006, another Chinook crashed attempting a night-time landing on a small mountain top in eastern Kunar province, killing 10 US soldiers. In 2005, a US helicopter crashed in Kunar, after apparently being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, killing 16 US personnel.

It is an almost unutterable message to Kate and Gerry McCann, but I feel I must say it before it is too late: "Please, please, for your own sake and the sake of your missing daughter Madeleine, step off this speeding juggernaut of publicity for just a second. Be still for one moment and think about what you are doing, about where you go next." I realise that just writing those words leaves me open to howls of protest, to accusations of callousness and insensitivity. The Pope's words of comfort for Madeleine's weeping parents Kate and Gerry McCann meet the Pope in Rome What mother or father in their situation could think of anything but getting their child back? Who could pause when every second might make the difference? But hear me out. Like millions of people, each night my first prayer is for Madeleine’s safe return. My second is for Kate and Gerry McCann, to give them the strength to endure the horror that has befallen them. Any parent would move heaven and earth to try to find their missing child. If that means shouting Madeleine’s name in every corner of the globe, then the McCanns have made it plain they will do so. To that end, they have helped orchestrate a publicity campaign to keep their daughter’s face in the forefront of the public’s mind, to maximise public support. The McCanns with twins Sean and Amelie And herein lies the danger. For I cannot help but question whether a new heart-rending, eye-catching initiative day after day is the right way to go about things. Especially when it means exposing even the most intimate moments of family despair. Moments like the one on Tuesday night, when they kissed goodbye to their two-year-old twins, Amelie and Sean, before flying off for their audience with the Pope. Not for one second do I doubt their motives — and Pope Benedict’s support is both moving and laudable. All the McCanns want is to get Madeleine back, whatever it takes, however long it takes. And yet, and yet me be clear: I do not agree with those — and there are a surprising number — who blame the McCanns for leaving their three children alone in that apartment in the first place. As Gerry McCann said, no one will ever blame them more than they blame themselves. What use is blame now anyway? Blame won’t get Madeleine back. Mummy and Daddy say goodbye to their children before setting off to meet the Pope But I do feel that the McCanns’ sustained public agony is so intense it is becoming almost unwatchable — thereby destroying its very purpose. None of us can imagine the full extent of the torment they are going through, day after day, as hope grows dimmer and desperation fades toward grief. But this I do know: the McCanns cannot be in a fit state to make rational judgements about what they are being asked to do. If someone told them that cutting off their arms would bring Madeleine back, they’d do it. And I do wonder about the people who are advising them. As the former Secretary of State for International Development Clare Short once remarked during coverage of famines in Africa, there is such a thing as compassion fatigue: the point at which the suffering is so great, people can no longer watch it, let alone respond to it. Madeleine McCann has been missing since May 3. "Despondency paralyses the will to action," she said, and that is as true of the missing Madeleine as it is of the starving millions. Having spoken to Scotland Yard experts on child abduction days after Madeleine went missing, I am well aware that in the beginning, it was crucial to keep her face on television and in newspapers. The courage it took for the McCanns to do that is unimaginable and I have nothing but the deepest admiration for them. Even their language in the first press conferences, saying how much Madeleine needed them and they needed Madeleine, was bravely scripted to try to trigger the response in her kidnapper to let her go. Then to have to trawl through pictures and video footage of their daughter to find the images that might jolt a witness’s memory — a fresh picture every day — must have been utterly heartbreaking. But then the Madeleine bandwagon began to roll and other people started falling over themselves to leap aboard. It’s one thing for the pop group Simple Minds to allow their hit single Don’t You Forget About Me to be played at football grounds to raise awareness in the first days after Madeleine’s disappearance. But when I heard two weeks later that Bryan Adams was considering allowing the re-release of his 1991 single, Everything I Do (I Do It For You) to help continue the campaign, I found myself wondering: was this good for Madeleine, or good for Mr Adams’s fading career? And whereas I have no doubt whatsoever about Gordon Brown’s motives — he of all people would understand the searing pain of losing a daughter — his much-publicised personal intervention leaves him open to charges at worst of political opportunism and at best of clumsiness. I hesitate to use such a phrase, but it seems, at times, as if we are witnessing "competitive grieving", with the McCanns’ private agony becoming a public sport. It’s not that Madeleine does not deserve special attention. Indeed, I wish every child who goes missing — hundreds in Britain and Europe every year, thousands in Africa and Asia — got that special treatment. No, the real problem now for the McCanns is that the public at large will grow weary of these orchestrated photo opportunities, and cynical about the parade of well-meaning celebrities who have offered their support. And then what? Only yesterday I saw a group of women gossiping over the papers when one saw the headline about Kate McCann’s trip to see the Pope. It read: "I have never left my twins before." The woman threw the newspaper down and said "If only that were true" — clearly referring to the night Madeleine went missing. One of her friends said she found the pictures of Kate and Gerry tearfully hugging the twins farewell in the full glare of the cameras disconcerting. "Is nothing private any more?" she asked. "Will it be a spread in Hello! next?" Callous, certainly, but also a reflection of how the public’s sympathy cannot be taken for granted: the weight of the tragedy is beginning to become unbearable to all those people who have, until now, joined in the prayers and the yearning for Madeleine’s story to have a happy ending. How will people react, I wonder, to the news that after yesterday’s trip to the Vatican, the McCanns will embark on a highly public trip around Europe? Once again, I understand why they feel they must keep Madeleine in the headlines, but they have to keep the public with them, too. And unfortunately they cannot do that by increasingly desperate and occasionally voyeuristic coverage of their pain. Look again at the pictures of Kate and Gerry with the Pope: they appear beyond exhaustion, so frail and stretched with suffering they seem ready to snap. Surely they need to take stock, to preserve their sanity, if not for their own sakes then for the sake of two adorable children who remain their most precious hope of happiness in these dark and desperate weeks. 58 people have commented on this story so far.

There is a lot of sense in this article but I wonder if, apart from the obvious desperation to find Madeleine there is the terror of how they would cope when all this publicity and furore is over and Madeleine has still not been found. - Barbara Wadsworth, Clitheroe, Lancashire, England Ms Platell, you and I might be castigated, but I believe you have hit the right note and have said much of what I feel over this situation. Saturation coverage leads to overload fatigue and whilst I respect the wishes of the McCanns to maintain this very high profile I do not believe it is achieving a great deal. - Ken, Suffolk, England Your email address will not be published make text area bigger Remember me - this will save you having to type out your name, location and email address when you next leave a comment.

EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana on Thursday urged greater flexibility from Iran in the growing row over its nuclear programme, but Tehran remained defiant ahead of key talks in Madrid. Solana "is asking the Iranians to show flexibility during the meeting today," his spokeswoman Cristina Gallach said before Solana met here with Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani. Earlier, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had also called on Iran "to change tactics" from its persistent defiance of UN Security Council demands to suspend uranium enrichment work, which Washington charges is part of a covert nuclear weapons programme. "The international community is united on what Iran should do and that is to suspend; to demonstrate that it is in fact not seeking a nuclear weapon under cover of civil nuclear power," Rice said in Vienna. Rice repeated Washington's offer to join multiparty talks on trade, security and technological benefits for Iran if the Islamic state halted the enrichment work. Thursday's meeting in Madrid will be the second between Solana and Larijani in just over a month after a fruitless head-to-head in Turkey in late April. It is also their first encounter since the expiration of a 60-day time limit set by the United Nations for Iran to stop enriching uranium, a process which can be used both to make nuclear fuel and, in highly purified form, the fissile core of an atomic bomb "This is a very difficult issue, the questions are very sensitive but a maximum effort must be made so that formal negotiations can start. For that to happen Iran must respect the Security Council resolutions," said Gallach. Oil-rich Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons, saying it wants only to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out. The meeting in Madrid has only a slim chance of achieving any breakthrough, with Tehran showing no sign of buckling under increasing international pressure. "There is no possible path for the suspension of the enrichment of uranium," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said Thursday. "Iran will use all legal and judicial means to realise its legitimate rights and will not halt its nuclear activities," Hosseini added. And Larijani, speaking before flying to Madrid on Wednesday, had said that suspending enrichment was "not a logical way" to resolve the nuclear issue. Foreign ministers from the Group of Eight most industrialised nations said Wednesday that they were prepared to back "appropriate measures" if Iran failed to change its stance. The US is leading calls by Western powers for existing sanctions on Iran to be tightened. The UN Security Council first imposed sanctions on Iran in December for rejecting its demands, and then modestly increased them in March. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- China, Britain, France, Russia and the United States -- are growing increasingly frustrated and are determined to see the punitive measures strengthened, an analyst said. "Iran would be deceiving itself to believe that they won't," said Mark Fitzpatrick, senior fellow for non-proliferation at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London think tank. "They will give Iran a chance to come to the bargaining table with something to offer, but if Iran does not budge, additional sanctions will surely be imposed."

The announcement came amid a slowdown in violence after two weeks of fighting between Palestinian rocket squads and Israeli forces. The fighting is expected to dominate the agenda of next week's meeting between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.

Two Palestinians traveling in a car in the northern West Bank were killed in an explosion Wednesday night, Palestinian security officials said, adding that the cause of the blast was not known. The violent Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades group, linked to the Fatah organization, said the two men were its militants and blamed Israel for the incident, but the Israeli army said it had no report of any military activity in the area.

VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article "The president is working night and day for a mutual, comprehensive cease-fire," said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a top aide to Abbas. Abu Rdeneh said next week's summit, scheduled for June 7, "is expected in the Palestinian territories." Officials would not say where, but in the past they have mentioned the West Bank oasis of Jericho as the likely venue. While the two leaders have held a series of meetings over the past year, the Palestinians haven't hosted any of the gatherings. Olmert's spokeswoman, Miri Eisin, said a West Bank meeting is "a possibility," but said the date and location still have not been finalized. Olmert and Abbas promised Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in March to meet every two weeks with the aim of moving beyond day-to-day issues and begin discussing the outlines of a final peace agreement. However, the men have met just once since then, in April, and next week's talks will focus on the fighting. A five-month truce in Gaza unraveled earlier this month when the Hamas militant group began firing barrages of rockets into southern , prompting Israel to respond with a series of airstrikes. More than 50 Palestinians, most of them militants, and two Israeli civilians have been killed. In the latest violence, Israeli aircraft attacked a Palestinian rocket-launching squad in northern Gaza. No injuries were reported. "We will actively pursue and hit these rocket launchers as well as those who operate them," said David Baker, an official in Olmert's office. Despite the flareup, there were signs of a slowdown in fighting. Hamas' military wing, which has been responsible for most of the recent rocket fire, said it has not launched a projectile in 48 hours. "Perhaps there is an unannounced cease-fire," Abu Rdeneh said. The smaller Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for Thursday's rocket fire. In a separate incident, Islamic Jihad said two members were slightly injured in an Israeli artillery strike.

The four-day ministerial talks are aimed at discussing reconciliation and joint economic projects, but struck a sour note over the hold-up in the badly needed food aid. The North's chief delegate Kwon Ho-Ung raised the matter when he met his southern counterpart, Unification Minister Lee Jae-Joung. "Our side reaffirmed our position and said we faced difficulties in implementing an agreement on our rice aid," said the South Korean delegation's spokesperson Ko Gyoung-Bin. "We told them there is no shift in the government's position." Ko said the South explained the reason for holding up the first shipment, which was supposed to be sent in late May. "We will try to solve it through further discussion." Asked if the dispute was impeding progress on other issues, Ko replied: "It's (too) early to say so." The South says it will not dispatch its first shipment until the North begins honouring a six-nation disarmament deal. The communist state says the two issues are unrelated and has urged the South to "keep its promise." At the first full session on Wednesday, South Korea reiterated appeals to the North to start closing its Yongbyon reactor, the first step in the disarmament agreement reached in February. The North refuses to move until a banking dispute with the United States is resolved. Kwon has blamed the United States for the delay. The South is also pressing for the gradual regular opening of two cross-border railway lines following a historic May 17 test run, and greater economic cooperation. To ease military tensions it proposes the resumption of talks between defence ministers, after the first and only meeting almost seven years ago. In a new sign of such tensions, the North's navy late Wednesday accused South Korea of infiltrating warships deep into North Korean waters across the disputed Yellow Sea border. "This is a serious military provocation creating a touch-and-go situation in those waters and an intolerable challenge to the high degree of patience and self-restraint exercised by KPA (North Korean) service persons," it said in a statement. The navy command said it would take "due measures" unless South Korea, which denied any incursions, stopped "reckless military provocations." At this week's talks the North has also taken the South to task for its joint military exercises with the US and urged it to repeal the tough anti-communist National Security Law. Relations between the two nations soured last year with the North's missile launches and nuclear test, but improved after the February nuclear deal. At the last ministerial round in March, the South agreed in principle to resume annual rice and fertiliser aid. But it delayed the first shipment of rice, out of an annual total of 400 000 tons, pending progress on nuclear disarmament. The North refuses to move until it receives $25-million (around R179-million) which had been frozen in a Macau bank under US-inspired sanctions. The US said the accounts were unfrozen in March but the North has had problems finding a foreign bank to handle the transfer. - AFP Car Insurance for Women USA Green Card Program Win Now For Real South Korea tears down fences Now you can get all your news - from politics in South Africa, the quirkiest stories in Step Beyond, the latest from the worlds of Motoring, Entertainment and Business - in one place. and you'll have all the latest news at your fingertips.

In comments likely to deepen a Russian-British feud reminiscent of Cold War spy scandals, Britain's chief suspect Andrei Lugovoy rejected Litvinenko's deathbed charge the Kremlin had ordered his poisoning with highly radioactive Polonium 210. At a packed news conference in Moscow, Lugovoy said he suspected MI6, the mafia and Boris Berezovsky, a multi-millionaire Kremlin critic who fled Russia for London, could have been involved in Litvinenko's murder. "The main role was played by British secret services and their agent Berezovsky," a confident and combative Lugovoy, himself a former KGB agent, told a news conference aired live on state television. "The poisoning of Litvinenko could not have been but under the control of British secret services," he said. Asked whether he had firm proof of British intelligence involvement in the murder, Lugovoy replied: "Yes". But Britain hit back by saying its request for Lugovoy's extradition from Russia -- which Moscow said it could not meet -- had nothing to do with MI6. "This is a criminal matter and is not an issue about intelligence," a Foreign Office spokesman said. "A British citizen was killed in London and UK citizens and visitors were put at risk." Looking tanned and dressed in a dapper pink shirt, Lugovoy said the Kremlin's enemies and the Western press were portraying him as a "Russian James Bond" in a campaign to tarnish Russia's image. &copy; Reuters 2007.

Japan beefs up whaling fleet for summer hunt in Antarctic Andrew Darby in Anchorage, Alaska JAPAN is modernising its whaling fleet ahead of this summer's Antarctic hunt, in what is seen as hard evidence of its quest to resume full-scale commercial whaling. A harpoon-equipped chaser boat was under construction to replace the last of the 1980s-style chasers still in service, Japan's Institute for Cetacean Research told the Also under consideration was a new factory ship to supplant the ageing and accident-prone Nisshin Maru, informed sources at the International Whaling Commission meeting said. The new chaser is the third in the Yushin Maru series of fast, highly manoeuvrable hunter/killer vessels to be built in the past six years. Costing a reported $16 million, it would add substantially to the whaling power at Japan's disposal as it tries to increase Antarctic kill by moving into larger species, taking 50 fin whales and 50 humpbacks in addition to the 935 minke whales on its list for the past two years. The 22-year-old Nisshin Maru caught fire for a second time in Antarctica last February, killing one crewman. It was speculated that the pressure to butcher large amounts of whale meat may have contributed to the blaze. The head of oceans campaigns for Greenpeace International, Shane Rattenbury, said new ships sent a signal that Japan was into whaling for the long haul. "This is a large-scale investment of capital, which takes 20 or 30 years to pay off." The Federal Environment Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was likely that ship-building would be underwritten by Japanese government subsidies. "This is the absurdity," he said. "You've got a heavily subsidised whale-killing industry resisting efforts to stop it, when these whales can generate an entirely self-sustaining whale-watching industry." send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today Japan beefs up whaling fleet for summer hunt in Antarctic Andrew Darby in Anchorage, Alaska Place a classified ad Copyright &#169; 2007.

'I think it's time for Iran to change its tactics' of defying UN resolutions to stop enriching uranium, Rice told reporters in Vienna. She was speaking as Iran's top negotiator Ali Larijani and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana were set to meet in Madrid in an attempt to lay the groundwork for international talks on Iran's nuclear ambitions. 'The international community is united on what Iran should do and that is to suspend, to demonstrate that it is in fact not seeking a nuclear weapon under cover of civil nuclear power,' Rice said at a press conference at a women's meeting in Vienna on the Middle East. Rice repeated the US position that if Iran stopped enriching uranium, which makes reactor fuel but also atom bomb material, the United States would be ready to join multiparty talks on trade, security and technology benefits for the Islamic Republic. 'If Iran is prepared to take that course, then we are prepared to change 27 years of American policy and sit with Iran to talk about whatever Iran would like to talk about,' Rice said. Iran is defying two rounds of UN sanctions imposed to get it to halt uranium enrichment. Iran claims it has a peaceful nuclear program and has the right to make nuclear fuel under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. But Rice said talks could not start 'when Iran continues to pursue, to try to perfect technologies that are going to lead to a nuclear weapon. 'So as I said to you before, the question isn't why won't we talk to Tehran, the question is why does Tehran not want to talk to us,' Rice said. Copyright AFX News Limited 2007. All rights reserved.

After emerging unscathed from the 1975-1990 Civil War, Lebanon's second most populated camp became a thriving entrepot thanks to its location on the coast midway between Tripoli and Akkar. Palestinian merchants purchased wholesale goods in bulk from Tripoli and sold them tax-free inside the camp, boosting the economic fortunes of Nahr al-Bared residents and retailers in the country's second largest city. "People in Nahr al-Bared were pretty well off. Traders from the camp came to Tripoli to buy goods and sell them in Nahr al-Bared, and there was a lot of trade with the surrounding areas until Fatah al-Islam came and the army surrounded the camp," the head of Hamas in North Lebanon, Abu Rabih al-Chehabi, told Nahr al-Bared was off the radar of most media outlets before Fatah al-Islam moved into the camp, but based on the accounts of residents displaced to Beddawi, everything from ceramic tiles, toilet bowls, and electronics to clothing, food, and cigarettes were sold at low prices on the bustling commercial strip. Though the majority of residents were relatively poor, said Suhail Natour, director of the Human Development Center,a Palestinian NGO, commerce had thrived in Nahr al-Bared for decades. "Nahr al-Bared was the only camp not damaged during the Civil War, so it was a converging point for the interests of wealthy traders in Tripoli and Palestinian merchants," he explained. "Since it had a small port on shore, it became a smuggling point for Syrian goods to Lebanon since the Civil War and remained so [until recently]." Natour said there has been a tacit agreement among the Lebanese, Palestinian, and Syrian authorities to maintain the status quo, allowing cheap Syrian goods to be smuggled into the camp by sea and sold duty-free, fueling Palestinian - and to a lesser extent Syrian and Lebanese - investment in Nahr al-Bared's economy. Commerce inside Nahr al-Bared dipped briefly when a highway between Akkar and Tripoli was constructed along the eastern border of the camp, but quickly rebounded when soe of the affected merchants moved closer to the highway. It was not until the army set up checkpoints around Nahr al-Bared three months ago and began restricting entry that the market began to suffer. "People from Akkar came to buy clothes, food, everything because it was cheaper in Nahr al-Bared, because there were no taxes. But then the army put up all these checkpoints, and it started taking a long time to get in and out of camp, so people stopped coming," displaced camp resident Fadi Moussa said. "No one wanted to spend an hour waiting to get inside." Most Tripoli merchants interviewed by The Daily Star all reported a fall in business when the army began to monitor Nahr al-Bared, and all said sales have plummeted since the fighting began. Qassem Mokheiber, the manager of the Tripoli Plaza clothing store, said that the Nahr al-Bared traders' bulk purchases were one of the store's main sources of revenue. "We were naturally affected when the army arrived," he told The Daily Star. "Tripoli was the main source for wholesale traders from Nahr al-Bared. They bought everything from us - clothes, toys, food," Mokheiber added. "We've had a few Palestinians displaced to Beddawi come in and buy clothes since the fighting started, but the business is meager compared to what we used to have. We're barely breaking even." Sales have dropped to just 10 percent of regular levels since the fighting between the Lebanese Army and Fatah al-Islam began more than a week ago, he estimated. Though the extent of infrastructure damage is still unclear, Natour doubts that any investors with capital will rush to rebuild Nahr al-Bared's economy in the absence of a sustained cease-fire. The Daily Star encountered a butcher and a barber who had already established temporary locations in Beddawi just two days after they fled Nahr al-Bared. "The fighting has totally demolished the camp's economy. Apparently the motive is security, but practically it has influenced the economic nerve center of Nahr al-Bared," said Natour. "Beddawi will be a temporary replacement, but not long term because smuggling was done through the sea."

Hariri: No ordinary murder Mark Seddon at the UN in New York Hariri supporters in Lebanon are hopeful, but the issue has exposed deep divisions [AFP] On face value, no politician or diplomat would be against prosecuting a serious crime, or bringing its perpetrators to justice. No politician or diplomat would ever say that it is acceptable to assassinate political opponents and then proceed to assassinate other key figures close to them. And yet, with a multitude of different agendas and principles whirling around, there are politicians and diplomats who are opposed to the setting-up of a UN International Tribunal to investigate the 2005 murder of Rafiq Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister, in a massive car bomb. But this was no ordinary murder, nor is this any ordinary tribunal. who abstained on Wednesday's resolution in the UN Security Council argued that they had good reason to do so. The resolution, supported by 10 countries, including the creates a precedent &#8211; although the UN might argue that it does not. It is a Chapter Seven resolution, which is invoked in cases of threats to international peace and security. It is binding, mandatory and can be backed by force if necessary. It gives the divided Lebanese parliament until June 10 to agree to the establishment of a tribunal. The massive car bomb attack in 2005 killed nine people, including Hariri [EPA] For the first time perhaps, an individual government, in this case the Lebanese government, will be forced to co-operate with a UN-backed court. Opinion is divided in too. The country&#8217;s president is against. The country&#8217;s prime minister is for. The opposition, official and unofficial is against. And yet the demonstrations marking Hariri&#8217;s murder two years ago were so massive, that the Syrian army, seen by some as occupiers, others as protectors, withdrew from much of the country. Throughout the long process of the Hariri Inquiry, presided over by a UN-backed team, countries and people not connected to the investigation have been pointing towards Syrian complicity in the attack on Hariri's motorcade, although this remains unproved. But for those who do believe that there was Syrian involvement, an international tribunal is seen as a device that may help make their cause. However, it remains the case that the forensic investigation of the murder site, where the massive car bomb exploded, have not yet led to any suspects being named. The Lebanese parliament now has a deadline. Yet already some are asking what the UN could do enforce its decision if the parliament fails to meet it, or for some reason does not agree. Others claim that this decision by the UN Security Council will lead to yet further violence and bloodshed. Many Lebanese people ask why their own country is not going to be allowed to run its own tribunal. Questions over Syria's involvement have yet to be answered [Reuters] Although others argue that given the great divides in Lebanese society, it is quite impossible to imagine their country hosting an investigation and criminal court case of such political magnitude. The United Nations, for its part, argues that there is no precedent; that there have been international tribunals in the former , investigating war crimes and in Once again critics say that had more or less ceased to exist as a state and wasn&#8217;t functioning as a state. Lebanon, on the other hand, despite its divisions and despite the terrible damage wrought by last year&#8217;s invasion by Israel, is a functioning state, and a state that cannot agree as to whether the tribunal is a good thing or not. The many supporters of Hariri are jubilant now that they believe that justice may actually be done. They believe that a line may at last be drawn under political assassinations if the perpetrators are brought to justice. But for others in , all of this reeks of outside interference. Others still believe that far from putting a cap on the violence, the creation of an international tribunal may just fuel it. Who is right and who is wrong, we shall see in the coming weeks and months.

Breaking news E-mail alerts Get breaking news in your inbox as it happens Spy killing suspect: Britain involved in plot By Jeffrey Stinson, USA TODAY LONDON &#151; The Russian businessman accused of killing former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko here last year denied any involvement on Thursday and said that British intelligence was likely to blame for the murder, perhaps because Litvineko was working with British agents and talking too much to others about it. Andrei Lugovoi, who was accused earlier this month of the murder by British prosecutors, made his sensational claim in a televised Moscow news conference that was broadcast live here. "Even if (British special services) hadn't done it itself, it was done under its control or connivance," Lugovoi said. He said he had evidence to substantiate his claim but didn't offer it. Lugovoi, a former Russian KGB agent too, also said: &#8226; British intelligence had sought to recruit him to provide "compromising information" on Russian President Vladimir Putin. &#8226; Litvinenko worked for British intelligence and may have done something to anger the service. &#8226; If British intelligence was not to blame for Litvinenko's death, then perhaps the Russian mafia or exiled Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky was. Berezovsky, who lives in London, was a friend and benefactor to Litvinenko. Berezovsky said that Lugovoi's press conference was proof that the Kremlin was behind the murder. "Everything about Mr. Lugovoi's words and presentation made it obvious that he is acting on Kremlin instruction," Berezovsky said in a statement. "If Mr. Lugovoi would like to prove his innocence, I suggest again that he travel to London and face trial in the (British) courts." But, Lugovoi insisted, he wasn't guilty of murdering Litvinenko, who died of poisoning from a rare radioactive isotope. "Britain is making me a scapegoat," he said. Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, has a policy of not responding to questions or commenting publicly. However, the Foreign Office brushed aside Lugovoi's allegations of British intelligence involvement. "This is a criminal matter and is not an issue of intelligence," the Foreign Office said in a statement from its press office. "A British citizen was killed in London, and (British) citizens and visitors were put at risk." Lugovoi said British agents were upset because Litvinenko bragged about his contacts with them. "In conversations with me, Litvinenko often &#8230; told me many things he shouldn't have said," Lugovoi said. "I got an impression that he was really getting out of British secret services' control. He believed that the British undervalued him and paid him too little for his service." Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of the Russian parliament, urged British authorities to help investigate "very serious accusations against British secret services." "I do believe they will take these new versions as seriously as it should be," Kosachev said on Lugovoi's accusations provide the latest twist in an intriguing murder case that has echoes of Cold War espionage and revenge, and which has reached the highest level of the Kremlin. It also has strained Anglo-Russian relations. And at one point, Litvinenko's radioactive poisoning prompted a widespread health alert in London and resulted in the grounding of three passenger jets. Litvinenko, 43, died from polonium-210 poisoning on Nov. 23 in a London hospital. He fell ill Nov. 1 after meeting with Lugovoi earlier in the day at London's Millennium Hotel near the U.S. Embassy. Lugovoi, now a Moscow businessman, said the meeting was about business that Litvinenko was helping him with. On his deathbed, Litvinenko accused Putin of being behind his death. Litvinenko had been a harsh Putin critic and a critic of Russia's involvement in Chechnya. He sought asylum in Britain in 2000 and later became a British citizen. Putin, also a former KGB agent, has dismissed Litvinenko's deathbed accusation, and the Kremlin has called it nonsense. Britain's director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, announced on May 22 that there was sufficient evidence to charge Lugovoi with Litvinenko's murder "by deliberate poisoning" Macdonald's accusation came after Scotland Yard detectives followed a trail of radioactive material across London, to Germany and to Russia. The radioactivity prompted the British Health Protection Agency to issue a public health alert in London after traces were found at a dozen sites across the city, including three hotels and a soccer stadium. It also prompted British Airways to alert thousands of passengers who might have been exposed to low levels of radioactivity aboard three jets. In Britain, 700 people were tested for polonium contamination, and 670 were tested abroad. All were eventually released. Britain has sought to extradite Lugovoi to Britain to be charged and tried for what Macdonald called "this extraordinarily grave crime." On Thursday, the Foreign Office said it still was awaiting Russia's response to the extradition request. "Our position is clear," the Foreign Office said in the statement. "A request for the extradition of Mr. Lugovoi to face trial in a (British) court has been handed over. We await the formal Russian response." It is unlikely that Lugovoi will be handed over. The Russian constitution prevents the extradition of a Russian citizen to a foreign country to face charges. Britain has not given any indication what the motive was behind Litvinenko's murder. Nor have prosecutors provided any details of how the poison was administered. The case has worsened Russia's relations with Britain and shined an unwelcome light on Putin, who has said he will step down as president next year.

Suspect Blames British For Spy's Death Litvinenko Died Of Poisoning By Rare Radioactive Isotope POSTED: 2:49 am PDT May 31, 2007 The Russian businessman whom Britain has named as a suspect in the killing of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko said Thursday that he has evidence of British special services' involvement in the poisoning death. "Even if (British special services) hadn't done it itself, it was done under its control or connivance," Andrei Lugovoi told a news conference. Asked if he had evidence for the allegation, he said "I have evidence" but did not elaborate. A British government security official, who demanded anonymity in exchange for discussing Lugovoi's claims because of the sensitivity of the case, said suggestions British intelligence had involvement in Litvinenko's death were spurious. Britain last week said it had enough evidence to charge Lugovoi, who also worked for the KGB and its main successor agency the FSB, in the November killing of Litvinenko. Litvinenko, who died of poisoning by the rare radioactive isotope polonium-210, had fled to Britain several years earlier after becoming a strong critic of the Kremlin and received British citizenship. Lugovoi and another Russian had met in London with Litvinenko on Nov. 1, the day Litvinenko said he became ill. Britain has requested Lugovoi's extradition, but Russia has refused, saying the constitution does not permit such extraditions. Lugovoi has repeatedly asserted he is not guilty in the matter. On Thursday, Lugovoi also claimed that Britain had tried to recruit him to provide intelligence. British special services "asked me to collect compromising information on President (Vladimir) Putin," Lugovoi said. Lugovoi said the attempted recruitment occurred during business trips to Britain in previous years. He did not give a precise date, but indicated the alleged approach occurred in late 2005 or early 2006. London's Foreign Office, responsible for the country's overseas secret intelligence service MI6, declined to comment on Lugovoi's claim. But another government official with knowledge of Lugovoi, who also demanded anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, said the allegations were untrue. . All rights reserved.

Brent Bozell III Frank J. Gaffney Jr. Phantom of the Movies Clicks and Mortar Column Dispatches from the Gulf The World & I Add To Insider Newsclips We regularly hear that the Bush administration has "missed" opportunities for engagement with Iran, as though Tehran is waiting in the wings to talk. If that were true, Iran would not be imprisoning, forcing false confessions from and otherwise seriously mistreating Iranian American activists, scholars and engagement advocates, all for political effect. The jailing of Haleh Esfandiari, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, on trumped-up espionage charges, should be a wake-up call for the "engagement" crowd -- and the same goes for similar charges leveled against three other American citizens in Iran. If Tehran is willing to imprison even congenial, pro-dialogue Westerners, then the message it intends is that it has zero interest in engagement. The Bush administration has not "missed" chances for dialogue. The 67-year-old Mrs. Esfandiari had been visiting her elderly mother when she was arrested three weeks ago by Iranian authorities. In a formal announcement, Iran acknowledged that it is holding Mrs. Esfandiari, reportedly in the notorious Evin prison, which is awful even by Iranian standards. The statement was timed to coincide with this week&#39;s unprecedented U.S.-Iranian bilateral talks on the security situation in Iraq. The charges against Mrs. Esfandiari allege a plot to destabilize the Islamic republic and otherwise harm Iranian national security. Iran is also holding Kian Tajbakhsh, a scholar at the New School for Social Research in New York City who has worked for the World Bank and for George Soros&#39; Open Society Institute. Mr. Tajbakhsh has consulted previously on development and urban planning projects with multiple arms of the Iranian government, including Tehran&#39;s social-security research center, its housing and urban development ministry and the municipality of Tehran. The third to be arrested is Parnaz Azima, a journalist for Radio Farda, the U.S. government&#39;s Persian-language radio service based in Prague and Washington. She has reportedly been interrogated, asked to collaborate with Iranian intelligence and has been told she cannot leave the country for two to three years. Also being held is mortgage-company businessowner Ali Shakeri, 59, a peace activist affiliated with the University of California-Irvine. Mr. Shakeri went to Iran to visit his ailing mother. Kayhan, the newspaper that speaks on behalf of Iran&#39;s clerical rulers, reportedly accused Mr. Shakeri of being a "CIA agent who has officially supported overthrowing the Islamic republic in interviews with opposition media and seeking to implement a secular state in Iran." All of the charges are spurious on their face. Each of the accused is a friend of the Iranian people, and all hold dual Iranian-U.S. citizenship. Mrs. Esfandiari is one of Washington&#39;s most visible engagement advocates -- the kind of person whom the regime would encourage if it were seeking accommodation and dialogue. Instead, it has placed her in its most notorious prison for enemies of the regime. It should now be obvious to even the most relentless engagement advocates that Tehran simply does not want engagement. Its history of hostage-taking is the record of a hostile regime, one whose character is unchanged over the years in its contempt for the West -- including its own defenders. That it would throw these congenial people in jail as a sideshow during the U.S.-Iran talks on Iraq is a telling indicator of that fact. Add To Insider Newsclips Want to use this article?

The Quartet called on Israel on Wednesday to use restraint and urged Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to do "everything to restore law and order", including the release of kidnapped BBC journalist Alan Johnston. The ministry said the statement "raised questions about the credibility of the Quartet as a neutral party" and would encourage Israel to continue attacks and the arrest of Palestinian ministers. "(The ministry) is surprised at the Quartet's lack of condemnation at Israel's kidnapping of the Palestinian parliament," it said in a statement. Egypt also said Israel's use of heavy weapons in attacks in civilian areas violated international law and the Geneva conventions. In the past week Israel has seized Palestinian Education Minister Naser al-Deen al-Shaer and another Hamas minister along with more than 30 other Palestinian officials. Hamas has said the Quartet statement "only served Israel" and made it party to the conflict. Comprising the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union, the Quartet announced plans on Wednesday for talks with the Israelis and the Palestinians at an undisclosed time and location in June as well as with the Arab League. news is provided by Zoom to full size map Facts & Figures - Human development index ranking (2004) INSTANT VIEW-Reaction to Bush on climate change FACTBOX-Security developments in Iraq, May 31 May toll for U.S. soldiers in Iraq climbs to 122 Israel, militants exchange limited fire in Gaza Soldier killed in Lebanon fighting Catholic Relief Services commends President's call to double PEPFAR funding Source: CRS - USA World Vision Lauds Bush Global AIDS Funding Proposal Source: WV - USA Gaza and West Bank &#8211; ICRC Bulletin No. 20 / 2007 Source: ICRC - Switzerland Displaced Palestinians receive First World Vision relief Source: WV MEERO - Cyprus Catholic Relief Services urges Congress to preserve US long-term development food aid initiatives that fight chronic hunger Source: CRS - USA Israeli tanks wait to cross into the northern Gaza Strip near Kibbutz Zikim May 31, 2007.

The insurgent Taliban movement said that its men shot down the Chinook in the southern province of Helmand late Wednesday. "We are able to say now that there may have been enemy fire in bringing down the helicopter," the Kabul media office for NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said. "It could be anything from small arms fire upwards." ISAF, which includes soldiers from 37 countries, will not release the nationalities of the dead soldiers, leaving this up to their home nations. The icasualties.org Web site, which charts casualties in the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, said that five of the dead were US nationals, but this was not confirmed by the US military here. Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi said late Wednesday that "our brothers in Helmand" had brought down the heavy transport helicopter. "The helicopter burst into flames in the sky and then crashed," he said, citing the local rebel cell that claimed to have to carried out the attack. The insurgents have made similar claims in the past but are only confirmed to have brought down one military aircraft in Afghanistan - in June 2005 when a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) shot down a Chinook in Kunar province. All 16 soldiers on board, eight of them US Navy SEALs, were killed. On Thursday Ahmadi said that he was still not clear how the helicopter was brought down. He also claimed that 35 foreign soldiers were killed, but the rebels usually inflate their tolls and their information is often unreliable. "The helicopter might have been shot down by RPG, other ordinary weapons, or by the new anti-aircraft weapons we have got now," Ahmadi said. "The group of 30 to 35 mujahideen [holy fighters] who carried out the attack have managed to leave the area sound and safe following the clash after the crash." ISAF said Wednesday that a unit that responded to the scene of the crash was ambushed. "Under continued fire, the responding patrol called for an airstrike to eliminate the enemy threat," it said. There have been suspicions that the militants, who are allied with Al Qaeda, are trying to acquire shoulder-fired anti-aircraft weapons for their fight against the NATO force and the separate US-led coalition. In March this year, the coalition said that it carried out precision airstrikes on Taliban militants who had been helping to move anti-aircraft weapons in Helmand, killing some of them. Helmand has seen a surge in military and Taliban activity. Hardcore Taliban are said to be allied with drugs barons and foreign fighters in the province, the country's top opium producer. The province is where the Afghan and foreign military forces said that they killed the Taliban's top military commander, Mullah Dadullah, this month in the military's biggest success against the movement. The rebels have vowed to avenge the commander's death.

South Korea urged communist North Korea on Wednesday to shut down its nuclear reactor and gradually open their heavily armed border to regular train traffic, amid a heightening standoff over the North's refusal to abide by a disarmament deal. (AP Photo/Jo Yong-Hak, Pool) SEOUL, South Korea -- The two Koreas will hold working-level military talks next week in the border village of Panmunjom, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said Thursday, amid fresh warnings from Pyongyang over disputed coastal waters. The talks will follow up on agreements reached at high-level military talks earlier this month, the official said on condition of anonymity, citing ministry protocol. At the earlier negotiations, the rival neighbors adopted a security agreement for a historic test-run of a train service across their heavily armed border. The test, which happened two weeks ago, marked the first time trains have crossed the tightly sealed border since the 1950-53 Korean War. During the discussions, North Korea also raised the issue of sea border disputes, and that issue was expected to play a key role in the new talks beginning June 8, after fresh warnings about a possible clash from North Korea. The North's navy command has warned that a skirmish along the disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea - the scene of deadly clashes in 1999 and 2002 - could occur unless Seoul stops entering the North's waters. On Wednesday, North Korea's Navy Command warned in a press release that its sailors were patrolling "with a high degree of vigilance," according to a dispatch carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency. "The reckless military provocations of the above-said warmongers pushed the situation in the waters off the West coast to such an extreme pitch of tension that a new armed clash may break out there any moment," it said. North Korea doesn't recognize the current sea border demarcated by the United Nations at the end of the Korean War, and has long claimed it should be further south. The waters around the border are rich fishing grounds, and boats from the two Koreas often jostle for position during the May-June crab-catching season. The earlier talks included two-star generals and were the first high-level military contacts between the two sides in a year. The announcement about next week's talks was made separately from ongoing Cabinet-level negotiations being held by the two Koreas in Seoul. Those talks are scheduled to end Friday and are aimed at various reconciliation efforts.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday "our positions are diametrically opposed and I don't see any chances of the positions moving any closer together". Russia has been opposing a draft resolution presented to the UN Security Council by the US and its EU allies, which would endorse a plan drawn up by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari for internationally-supervised independence for Kosovo. Attempts to bridge the gap on the draft resolution failed to make headway during talks that US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice held in Moscow in mid-May. Russia's publicly stated position is that a solution needs the approval of both parties. Mr Lavrov reiterated that point during a recent visit to Belgrade, after he met Serbia's President Boris Tadic. Russia's foreign minister wants more negotiations on Kosovo "Ultimate legitimacy can be reached through decisions that will be acceptable to both sides," Mr Lavrov said, "in this case, both for Kosovar Albanians and Belgrade". Since Serbia has rejected the Ahtisaari recommendations out of hand, that would imply that Russia might use its veto, as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, to scupper the proposed supervised independence for Kosovo. The United States and - more reluctantly - the EU have endorsed the Ahtisaari plan as the best one possible, in the absence of an agreement between Belgrade and Kosovo's overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian community. No such deal emerged from a year-long series of talks Mr Ahtisaari chaired in Vienna until March. Meanwhile, Western governments are hoping that Moscow's disapproval does not necessarily mean it will veto a UN resolution. Russia's most senior officials - including Mr Lavrov - have tended to avoid using the term "veto", while hinting at its possible use. That has been viewed as an attempt on the Kremlin's part to keep its options open. However, in recent months - particularly since the emergence of the Ahtisaari proposals - Russia has adopted a firmer position in arguing for a settlement reached by consensus. It has made fewer attempts to establish an analogy between Kosovo and the pro-Russian breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia. Last year President Vladimir Putin sought to highlight such a link, implying that if Kosovo gained independence, then so should these territories. Russia's opposition to the West over Kosovo does not appear to be motivated by a history of friendship with Serbia on grounds of a shared Slavic cultural background and Orthodox Christian heritage. After all, Russia pulled its peacekeepers out of Kosovo in 2003, despite the fact that the Serb minority there were complaining, as they still are, of being the victims of harassment and discrimination at the hands of the ethnic Albanian majority. Russia's early departure from Kosovo, justified on grounds of cost-cutting, was viewed by many Kosovar Serbs as leaving them in the lurch. The withdrawal from Kosovo four years ago was also in stark contrast with the unannounced arrival of Russian peacekeepers there back in 1999. The Russian dash to Pristina airport nearly produced a confrontation with the main body of the peacekeeping contingent under Nato's command which the Russian troops eventually joined, as originally agreed. Russia's conduct both in 1999 and today appears to be motivated by a determination to show the West, and the US in particular, that it should be taken seriously - as one of the key players on the international stage. The circumstances now are very different, though. Thanks to its oil wealth in an era of high energy prices, Russia believes it has regained its former status as a great power, which it lost during the economic collapse in the immediate post-communist era. Mr Ahtisaari failed to get a deal between Serbs and ethnic Albanians When it comes to the dipomatic battle of wills over Kosovo, that factor probably accounts for much more than Russia's sympathy for the Serbs - although support for fellow-Orthodox Serbs has a populist appeal to some sections of Russian society. The Kremlin might still decide to abstain in a vote - an option made easier by the fact that the text of the UN resolution, like the main section of Mr Ahtisaari's blueprint, does not include an explicit reference to "independence". Western diplomats also note that, until very recently, Russia played what they describe as a generally "constructive" role as a member - along with the US, Britain, France, Germany and Italy - of the six-nation Contact Group that has been spearheading the UN's drive to settle Kosovo's status. However, before the Kremlin reconsiders its stance it may be looking for some concessions, both on Kosovo and other issues. In the case of Kosovo, these could include a moratorium on the territory's membership of the UN and other international bodies once it becomes independent. Elsewhere, Moscow may be angling for an undertaking from Nato not to continue its enlargement into former Soviet republics by inviting Georgia, and possibly Ukraine, to join the alliance. Meanwhile, Washington has also signalled its readiness to bypass Russia, if necessary, by stating that it will recognise Kosovo's independence, even if there is no UN Security Council resolution in place to endorse it. Russia may want to avoid a confrontation of that kind, and it has repeatedly tried to put off the moment of decision by calling for more talks. But the US and key Western countries believe the time for further delays has passed. They are concerned about a build-up of frustration among Kosovo's Albanian majority - and unlike Russia, they have peacekeepers on the ground who may become the targets of possible violence. The last chance for a deal may now be just a few days away - at the G8 summit of leading industrial nations in Germany on 6-8 June. If Russia stands by Serbia, Kosovo's assembly will almost certainly vote for a unilateral declaration of independence. That would be a scenario for diplomatic upheaval and chaotic developments on the ground, which would present further challenges not only to the West but Russia as well.

Thu, 31 May 2007 THE WEEK IN REVIEW » All the stories from the past 7 days SA abstains from UN's 'Lebanon' vote Thu, 31 May 2007 South Africa abstained from voting on the United Nations Security Council proposal for a special tribunal to prosecute suspects in the assassination of former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafiq Hariri, said the department of foreign affairs on Wednesday. "South Africa as a matter of principle abstained on voting for the current resolution on Lebanon in the Security Council," said department spokesperson Ronnie Mamoepa in a statement. He said the South Afrrican government reiterated its strong condemnation of the assassination and called for the perpetrators to be brought to account. Mamoepa said while South Africa supported the need for a special tribunal for this, the government believed this should be "the product of consensus within Lebanon as required by the Lebanese constitution and not an imposition of the Security Council". He said imposing a tribunal would politicise international criminal law and thus undermine international law. "For South Africa, the key principle is that all violators of international law including international humanitarian law in Lebanon are brought to justice and not only those who perpetrate criminal acts against one faction within Lebanon." AP reported that the Security Council approved the resolution to establish the tribunal.

They took away five rosaries he had blessed, including one for Madeleine, and perhaps the most intense emotions they have experienced since the horror of learning, nearly a month ago, that their four-year-old had vanished. "This is something we will cherish for the rest of our lives," Mr McCann told one of the people escorting them away from the event. "It was more personal, more pastoral, than we could ever have thought." Mrs McCann had intended to give the pontiff a copy of the now famous photograph of her daughter. But the gift came back to her, spiritually charged. Benedict took it from her hands and rested his own hand on the girl's image for several moments in silence, then with his thumb made the sign of the cross on her face and handed the photograph back. "It was a very emotional but also a very positive experience really," she said a few minutes later, at a press conference. "It's very important for us. That photograph will stay with me now." "There was recognition immediately," her husband added. "And looking at Madeleine's photograph, his touch and his thought and his words were more tender than we could ever have hoped. That will help sustain us in this most difficult time." The dignified pursuit by the McCanns of their lost child has acquired an extraordinary momentum. It has become far more than the story of one little girl and two distraught parents. It has become an emblematic saga of love and faith tested in the fire of terrible misfortune and emerging stronger; it has become a sort of contemporary parable of the power of belief. The ease with which the encounter with the Pope was arranged is part of the developing fable. Kate McCann is a devout Catholic, and yesterday, her husband said that the huge response to their tragedy "has restored my faith - my Catholic faith but also my faith in humanity." But according to gossip in Rome yesterday, the idea of a Rome pilgrimage originated not with the McCanns but with the News of the World. The British paper phoned its Rome stringer, Nick Pisa, to ask if he thought a meeting between the couple and the Pope could be set up. Pisa made inquiries and the response from the Vatican was encouraging - by which time the newspaper had lost interest. But Pisa pursued it, with the help of the British embassy, and lo and behold, it came to pass. And although the couple's campaign has turned into a huge media event, their own simplicity and sincerity shine through untarnished. The McCanns have generated a sort of charisma around themselves and their determination. If faith and resolve have the sort of potency to which the couple bear witness, Madeleine will soon be found, safe and well. "There could be a breakthrough at any minute," Mr McCann told a room full of journalists in Rome. "There could be a call to say that Madeleine has been found. We have to continue believing. "Many, many thousands and tens of thousands of people are doing small things that may make a difference, and we take strength from that. Even the smallest things by the greatest number of people that will achieve the maximum in terms of publicity around Madeleine's disappearance." Last night they were back in the Algarve, but trips to Madrid, Berlin and Amsterdam - cities from which many tourists travel to the Algarve - are planned. "One of the worst feelings was helplessness," Mr McCann said. The campaign "makes us feel we are doing everything in our power".

Ten policemen were among the dead in the attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. Fallujah, in restive Anbar province, is 65 kilometers (40 miles) west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated his explosives vest at the third of four checkpoints as he stood among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only been opened on Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The U.S. military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a lose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaida.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Wife of Calif. Businessman Says Iran Is Holding Her Husband Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, May 31, 2007; 10:48 AM The wife of California businessman Ali Shakeri today appealed to the Iranian government for information on her husband, who has been missing since May 8, according to family members in Iran. Shakeri, a peace activist, is the fourth American citizen reported detained by Iran in recent weeks. The Iranian government has denied holding him. In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article Zohreh Shakeri said her husband called her three times from Tehran's notorious Evin Prison and asked her not to comment publicly on his situation. A family member in Tehran saw her husband at the prison two weeks ago and also was asked not to say anything publicly. But after 24 days of silence, Shakeri said she had decided to break her silence. "I need to know where my husband is. I'm devastated. I don't know what to do," she said in an interview today. She said she has not received a call from him since May 17. It is common for Iran to tell detainees to urge family members not to say anything about their detention, according to human rights groups. Shakeri, who graduated from the University of Texas in the 1970s, had returned to Iran to visit his mother, who was ill and died while he was there, his wife said. He was due to return on a flight May 8 but has not been seen since he went to the airport, according to friends and family. The activist group Human Rights Watch put out the first alert about him. Shakeri's appeal comes as a coalition of international human rights activists today called on Iran to immediately release two detained Iranian-Americans, clarify the status of Shakeri and lift the travel ban on a journalist who is a dual national. The coalition includes Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation for Human Rights, Reporters without Borders and Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian human rights lawyer. "These measures appear to be an attempt by Iran's security authorities to sow fear into the wider community of journalists, writers, scholars and activists," they said in a joint statement. "Their exchanges with counterparts in other parts of the world underscore both their commitment to enhance mutual respect and recognition of human dignity through dialogue and to see human rights norms upheld in their country." Shakeri, a resident of Irvine, CA, may be the victim of an "enforced disappearance," the statement staid. Also jailed in Iran are American scholar Haleh Esfandiari and social scientist Kian Tajbakhsh. The Iranian government also has refused to allow Parnaz Azima, correspondent for U.S.-funded Radio Farda, to leave the country since January. All three were charged Tuesday with espionage and endangering Iran's national security.

Quartet demands new PA gov&#39;t recognize Israel / Revived Quartet of Middle East peace negotiators underscore demand that any Palestinian government must recognize Israel. Quartet statement &#39;reaffirms commitment to meet regularly&#39; on Mideast situation The panel did not demand Israel end its military activity in the Strip, but urged Israel to exercise restraint to ensure that its security operations avoid civilian casualties or damage to civilian infrastructure in the Palestinian territories. The panel, comprised of the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union, also demanded the release of Hamas ministers and parliament members arrested by Israel over the past few weeks. Ban's statement came after the Quartet meeting in Berlin in which Ban himself, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, American Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the EU's Javier Solana , European Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy Benita Ferrero-Waldner and German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier were present. The Quartet expressed its concern of the tense internal situation in Gaza and urged the Palestinians to end all violence and honor the ceasefire. The panel also called on Palestinians to cooperate with President Mahmoud Abbas, and regional leaders in order to regain law and order in the Strip, which would bring about the release of kidnapped BBC reported Alan Johnston. The immediate and unconditional release of kidnapped IDF soldier Despite the deteriorating situation in the south, the Quartet members welcome continued dialogue between Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and urged the parties "to create an environment conducive to progress on the political horizon for Palestinian statehood." "Palestinians must know that their state will be be viable, and Israelis must know that a future state of Palestine will be a source of security, not a threat," the statement added. Alongside the demand that the Palestinian government recognize Israel and honor previous agreements, the Quartet reiterated its request that remove all illegal settlements and help improve the Palestinians' situation by opening crossings and removing roadblocks. Israel was also urged to transfer the seized Palestinian tax money to a temporary international body which would ensure the money reached the right bodies. The Quartet stated that this would lead to a real improvement in the situation. The statement further said that the Quartet welcomed the Saudi peace plan, and praised the Arab League's intention to cooperate with Jerusalem. The quartet said it planned to meet the Israelis and Palestinians next month as well as the Arab League in a bid to revive peace hopes further dimmed by a new round of violence.

That announcement came as diplomats from the two Koreas held talks in Seoul - where South Korea told the North it will send food aid when Pyongyang lives up to its promises on nuclear weapons. VOA's Kurt Achin has more from the South Korean capital. South Korea's Defense Ministry said Thursday that military officers from North and South will meet next Friday in Panmunjom. That village is where a 1953 armistice halted fighting, but did not formally end, the Korean War. The talks are expected to focus on preventing conflicts over the sea border. North Korean naval authorities this week announced they were patrolling the waters west of the Korean peninsula "with extra vigilance" and accused the South of "reckless military provocations." North Korea does not accept the sea border established by the United Nations in 1953, and has been involved in at least two deadly skirmishes at sea with the South since 1999. N. Korea's delegation head Kwon Ho Ung, left, talks with S. Korea's Unification Minister Lee Jae-joung during their dinner in Seoul, 31 May 2007 Separately, high-level diplomats from North and South held a second day of talks Thursday at a hotel here in Seoul. South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Koh Kyoung-bin told reporters that the North's delegates asked about a South Korean promise to ship 400,000 tons of rice to the impoverished North. Koh says South Korea's position about providing rice to the North has not changed - it is something that will be done on the basis of trust. He says North and South should work cooperatively to resolve what he calls "a difficult situation." North Korea has missed by nearly two months a deadline it agreed to earlier this year to begin dismantling its nuclear weapons programs. South Korea says the aid it promised was predicated on North Korea's implementation of that agreement, and says the shipment will be delayed until the North takes action. Pyongyang blames the delay on a banking issue involving the transfer of $25 million of its money from a bank in Macau. No international bank has been willing to handle the transfer since the U.S. Treasury Department announced the money was linked to illegal North Korean activities. North Korea says there will be no progress on the nuclear issue until the funds are returned. Senior South Korean and U.S. officials say the financial issue will be resolved soon.

The events surrounding the murders of five Australian newsmen in East Timor in 1975 have been obscured by a shameful combination of deceit, diplomatic compromise and political expediency. But a QC assisting a New South Wales coroner has this week recommended prosecution for war crimes of two un-named former Indonesian army officers. The prospect that someone may finally be held to account for the murders will bring joy to the families of the Balibo Five. But it will also send a shiver through the corridors of Foreign Affairs in Canberra, where maintaining a good relationship with Indonesia is a constant battle. The inquest into the death of Brian Peters has already resulted in a potentially explosive diplomatic incident. Jakarta's Governor Sutiyoso stormed out of Australia after two NSW detectives entered his Sydney hotel room and attempted to serve a summons for him to appear at the coronial inquest. Governor Sutiyoso is accused of being in Balibo in 1975 as the captain of a special operations unit, a charge he has denied. Our relations with Indonesia are extremely important, particularly in the fight against regional terrorism, and deft diplomatic footwork will be required by Foreign Affairs to ensure this issue does not sour relations with Jakarta. However, that does not mean that there should be any soft-pedalling on seeking the truth of what happened to the Balibo Five and if possible pursuing those who murdered them.

Cheering crowds in Beirut greeted the decision by the Security Council last night with flag waving and celebratory gunfire in the streets, but some Lebanese newspapers this morning echoed Syria&rsquo;s suggestion that a tribunal may cause even greater instability in the country. Hariri was killed by a truck bomb in February 2005, initial UN investigations implicated Syrian authorities in his murder. The dispute over Hariri&rsquo;s death is at the centre of a deep political crisis between the Western-backed government and the Syrian-backed opposition, led by Hezbollah. There has been no official reaction from Hezbollah to the UN resolution, but the pro-opposition al-Akhbar newspaper said setting up the court without consensus &ldquo;raises serious concern for security and stability&rdquo;. Q&A: explaining the violence in Lebanon Lebanon Army battles &lsquo;al-Qaeda&rsquo; militia Beirut struggles to heal the scars of war &ldquo;The establishment of the court according to an international resolution and without the agreement of a large segment of citizens ... widens and deepens the fracture among Lebanese,&rdquo; Omar Neshabi wrote. Tensions in the divided country have become increasingly sectarian with the most intense internal fighting since the country's civil war this month. More than 50 people have been killed in fighting between the Lebanese Army and Fatah al-Islam, a heavily-armed pro-Syrian splinter group. Hariri supporters denied that the move would lead to increased violence. &ldquo;It is a historic moment an opportunity for all Lebanese to unite... the court is not about vendettas, but about justice for all,&rdquo; said Hariri&rsquo;s son Saad, leader of the parliamentary majority. "Enough divisions. .. Let's put our energies together for the sake of the nation." The UN resolution gives the Lebanese government until June 10 to settle the arrangements for a court in a neutral country. The Lebanese parliament has until now been unable to agree over the scope and remit of a tribunal to study the circumstances of the former Prime Minister&rsquo;s death. The Security Council voted yesterday by 10-0 in favour of the tribunal, but five countries abstained. Russia, China, South Africa, Indonesia and Qatar objected to using Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, which deals with threats to international peace and allows military enforcement, as a basis for the resolution. Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador to the UN, warned that only a tribunal supported by all Lebanese factions would be effective. The council's move "will give rise to a series of political and legal problems, likely to add to the uncertainties embedded in the already turbulent political and security and situation in Lebanon," he said. The vote had been requested by Fouad Siniora, Lebanese Prime Minister, who claimed the trial would allow for &ldquo;the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth&rdquo; to be revealed. The UK and the United States were among the six sponsors of the resolution. Margaret Beckett, the Foreign Secretary, said: &ldquo;The Security Council has demonstrated its support for the government of Lebanon and its commitment to the principle that there shall be no impunity for political assassinations, in Lebanon or elsewhere.&rdquo; Reaction to the tribunal from Syria was hostile. Tishrin, the government newspaper, said in an editorial this morning that the resolution was &ldquo;absolutely an American-Israeli one and could never be regarded as an expression of the international will&rdquo;. Bashar Assad, President of Syria, has threatened not to cooperate with the court if it infringes on Syrian national sovereignty. * Town / City Save to my times Also in Middle East Fear and celebration greets Hariri tribunal vote by UN Lecturers&rsquo; union votes to back Israel boycott Anger at campaign to woo gay couples on Holy Land holidays Hunt for Britons goes on amid Iraqi violence Jobs and Gates bury the hatchet Mandela: Blair still has lots to offer world Woman dies after electricity cut off 'More tender than we could imagine' Where a spell of fame begins with a bee The Times in the Middle East A series of articles on the Middle East to mark the debut of International Edition in the region The restored Hejaz Railway is to be rebuilt as an intercity express Gaza close to civil war as Hamas threatens suicide attacks News and views from Ned Parker and Stephen Farrell Full coverage of Iraq For breaking news stories and detailed analysis Your guide to seeing the very best of what the Middle East has to offer Weather forecasts for the Middle East region Latest developments in oil, gas and other natural resources She relied on an oxygen machine.

Deputy spokesman Tom Casey said the United States is seeking consular access for Ali Shakeri, a peace activist from Irvine, Calif., who was supposed to leave Iran and fly to Europe on May 13 but never arrived at his destination. Shakeri is the third Iranian-American who has been detained in Iran in recent weeks. "What we are seeing is a disturbing pattern on the part of the Iranians in efforts to harass these innocent people," Casey said. He said all were visiting family members or engaged in professional work. Shakeri is founding board member at the University of California, Irvine's Center for Citizen Peacebuilding. Casey said Shakeri has no standing with the U.S. government. Conflicting Iranian press reports say Shakeri has been charged or soon will be charged.

(L'Osservatore Romano) Gerry and Kate McCann on board a private jet at Faro airport in Portugal as they leave for Rome. (AP / Steve Parsons) This March 2007 photo released by the McCann family shows Madeleine McCann. (AP /HO) Pope meets with parents of missing girl Updated Wed. May. 30 2007 8:00 AM ET The parents of four-year-old Madeleine McCann, who disappeared during a family vacation in Portugal on May 3, visited the Vatican today and met with Pope Benedict XVI. Kate and Gerry McCann, both devout Catholics, shook hands with the Pope as he made his way through a large crowd at the end of his general audience in St. Peter's Square. Then they handed the Pontiff a picture of their daughter. "The Pope put his hand on the photo, he blessed the photo and then spoke to the parents for a few minutes," Vatican Affairs Correspondent Gerry O'Connell told CTV Newsnet Wednesday. Kate, carrying a pink, fluffy toy cat belonging to her missing daughter, appeared to be holding back tears during the brief encounter. Madeleine's father kissed the Pope's hands. "You could see from their faces they were really torn with sorrow, they were appealing to the Pope," O'Connell said from Rome. Before the encounter, Madeleine's parents said they hoped to draw strength from their meeting as well as to help keep the campaign to find their daughter in the media spotlight. "We have mixed emotions about being here," Madeleine's father, Gerry, told reporters as he and his wife arrived to attend the Pope's general audience. "Under normal circumstances it would be one of the most exciting things we could do in our own lifetime, but very much on our minds is the fact that we're here without Madeleine." Madeleine vanished after her parents left her, and her brother and sister -- both aged 2 -- alone while they went to a nearby restaurant within their hotel complex in the Algarve. British media have reported $2.6 million pounds (Cdn$6.1 million dollars) has been contributed to a reward fund from citizens and celebrities such as J.K. Rowling and Sir Richard Branson. The McCanns said they would not return to the U.K. until their daughter was found. They are set to return to southern Portugal later Wednesday and are also planning trips to Madrid on Friday and Berlin on June 4.

Problems have arisen because the world changed and there was an attempt to make it unipolar,' Putin told reporters following talks with his Greek counterpart. There was a desire among several international actors to dictate their will to each and everyone and to act not in accordance with the norms of international life and law,' Putin said. This is very dangerous and unhealthy. The norms of international law were altered for political expediency. What is this political expediency and who defines it? In our view it is nothing other than diktat, than imperialism.' However US national security council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said that differences between the two nations 'could be worked out'. 'While we have some differences, they are nothing other than issues that can be worked out through the continued dialogue we have face to face,' he said. 'The United States and Russia cooperate on a range of issues from counter-terrorism to global energy solutions,' added Johndroe. Copyright AFX News Limited 2007. All rights reserved.

Last night, US vehicles took up positions around the edge of the capital's Sadr City district. The neighbourhood is a stronghold of the Mahdi Army militia, loosely led by the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, which some have claimed is behind the abductions. Four British security guards, employed by GardaWorld, and their client, a financial consultant working for the US company BearingPoint, were abducted from inside the finance ministry building in Baghdad shortly before noon on Tuesday. Men wearing police uniforms drove them away in the direction of Sadr City. A local policeman said a US helicopter fired on a car and home in the area shortly before dawn, killing an elderly couple who had been sleeping on their roof because of the hot weather. The US military did not comment on the alleged attack, but said its forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" in Sadr City today. According to a confidential Iraqi government report into the kidnapping, parts of which were leaked to the media today, the defence and interior ministers believe the raid was the work of the Mahdi Army. The report, written by the head of the finance ministry's data processing centre, where the Britons were seized, quoted General David Petraeus, the US commander in Iraq, as saying the Mahdi Army "will be profoundly sorry" if it carried out the attack. However, others doubt the militia is to blame. Sheikh Abdel al-Sattar al-Bahadli, a leading cleric with experience in hostage negotiation, told the BBC's Arab service that the Mahdi Army was not involved and wanted to build a new Iraq peacefully. According to the report, four men in civilian clothing arrived at the ministry building around 15 minutes before the kidnapping, claiming to be from the government's anti-fraud commission and checking each room before leaving. Shortly afterwards, dozens of men in army and police uniforms burst into the building, disarmed guards and went to the room in which the five Britons were working. The men were immediately taken out and driven away in a convoy of four-wheel drive vehicles. The foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, said British officials were doing all they could to secure the "swift and safe release" of the Britons. "This is clearly a very distressing time for all concerned," she said yesterday. "Foreign Office officials are offering help and assistance to the next of kin. We are working closely with the Iraqi authorities." Tony Blair, speaking in Sierra Leone, said: "We know the dangers and challenges there [in Iraq], but we shouldn't let those who are prepared to use kidnapping and terrorism succeed."

Mr Putin said it was a "response to maintain the strategic balance in the world", in what he called a "new round of the arms race". He added that Russia would continue to improve its resources. Russia tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile, which can be armed with up to 10 warheads, on Tuesday. These actions by Russia should not be feared, they are not aggressive Europe diary: Missile defence "Our American partners have left the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty," Mr Putin told a press conference. "We have warned them then that we will come out with a response to maintain the strategic balance in the world." Mr Putin defended Russia's actions, insisting they were not the "initiators of this new round of the arms race". "(Our partners) are stuffing Eastern Europe with new weapons," he said. "A new base in Bulgaria, another in Romania, a site in Poland, radar in the Czech Republic. What are we supposed to do? We cannot just observe all this." He added: "These actions by Russia should not be feared, they are not aggressive, it's just an answer to rather tough and unjustified unilateral actions by partners." Washington wants to deploy interceptor rockets in Poland and a radar base in the Czech Republic to counter what it describes as a potential threat from "rogue states" such as Iran and North Korea. The US maintains its system is not directed at the Russians, but Moscow says its security is being threatened. Russia's test launch took place at the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia on 29 May. The missile, called RS-24, was designed to evade missile defence systems, the Russian defence ministry says. The test missile successfully struck its target 5,500km (3,400 miles) away on the far eastern Kamchatka peninsula, the Russian Strategic Missile Forces said.

While many in Lebanon welcome the decision, pro-Syrian voices threaten that it may destabilize the country. Lebanese government supporters celebrate after hearing that the UN Security Council voted to set up a tribunal into the murder of former PM Rafik Hariri. The United Nations Security Council has voted to set up a tribunal to look into the 2005 murder of the former Lebanese premier, Rafik Hariri. But while the pro-Western government welcomes the move, pro-Syrian voices say the tribunal could further destablize the country. The Security Council voted on Wednesday to unilaterally establish an international tribunal to investigate Hariri's assassination. Five members of the 15-member body abstained during the vote, including veto powers Russia and China. The tribunal needed at least nine votes in favor to go ahead. The resolution stipulates that a 2006 agreement between the UN and Lebanon on the creation of a tribunal will automatically come into effect on June 10, if the conflicting parties in Lebanon do not agree to set up their own tribunal. The five countries that abstained objected to establishing it without the Lebanese parliament's approval and to putting the resolution under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, which deals with threats to international peace and allows for military enforcement. Syria has fiercely criticized the UN decision, arguing that the tribunal undermines Lebanon's sovereignty and threatens to further destabilize the country. And Syrian President Bashar Assad has already indicated that he will not cooperate with the investigation if it infringes on Syrian soverignity. After Wednesday's vote Syria's UN ambassador Bashar Ja'afari said: "This is something that goes against the interests of the Lebanese people and Lebanon as a whole." Hariri, a prominent critic of Syria's involvement in Lebanon, was killed by a suicide bomb attack in Beirut on Feb. 14, 2005, along with 22 other people. The huge protests in the aftermath of the killing forced Syria to end a decades-long military presence in the country. The intial investigation into the assassination, carried out by Germany's Detlev Mehlis, pointed to the involvement of Syrian and Lebanese intelligence agents. Four pro-Syrian Lebanese generals have been under arrest for 20 months in connection with the crime. Sign up for Spiegel Online's daily newsletter and get the best of Der Spiegel's and Spiegel Online's international coverage in your In- The issue of the tribunal has sharply polarized opinion in Lebanon, often along sectarian lines. Prime Minister Fuad Saniora, who leads a Western-backed government, had asked the Security Council earlier this month to establish the tribunal, after the parliamentary speaker, Nabih Berri, refused to convene a session so that the parliament could ratify the tribunal. Berri, a leading member of the pro-Syrian opposition, said Thursday that the Security Council is ignoring the need for a Lebanese consensus on the issue. "You have picked internationalization instead of the state," he said in a brief statement. The parliament in Beirut still has a chance to set up a tribunal under its own steam. But if it does not act by June 10, then an international tribunal will created outside the country. Saniora said that the tribunal would finally be able to uncover the truth about the Hariri murder. Supporters of the slain politician danced in the streets on Wednesday night after hearing news of the UN decision. His son Saad Hariri, who now leads the anti-Syrian coalition which controls the government, said the resolution was a turning point in Lebanon, which would protect the country from further assassinations. He called it a "victory the world has given to oppressed Lebanon."

(New York, May 31, 2007) – The Iranian government should immediately release two Iranian-Americans from detention and clarify the case of a third who may have "disappeared," a group of leading human rights organizations said today. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation for Human Rights, Reporters Without Borders and the Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi also urged Iran to lift travel bans on two journalists with dual nationality whom Iran has barred from traveling back to their home countries. These measures appear to be an attempt by Iran's security authorities to sow fear into the wider community of journalists, writers, scholars and activists. Their exchanges with counterparts in other parts of the world underscore both their commitment to enhance mutual respect and recognition of human dignity through dialogue and to see human rights norms upheld in their country. "These actions violate Iran's laws as well as international norms," said Ebadi, winner of the 2003 Nobel peace prize, who is also the lawyer for two of those caught in the crackdown. "The Judiciary is denying dual-nationals their basic rights." The detentions and travel bans are part of a broad crackdown being mounted against Iranian human rights activists, students, and labor organizers by Iranian intelligence officials based in the country's Information Ministry. Intelligence officials in the Information Ministry are currently holding two Iranian-American scholars, Kian Tajbakhsh and Haleh Esfandiari, inside Tehran's notorious Evin prison. Another Iranian-American, Ali Shakeri, a peace activist from Irvine, California, is also believed to be in detention, and may be the victim of an enforced disappearance. In addition, the government has confiscated the passports of two journalists, Parnaz Azima, an Iranian-American, and Mehrnoush Solouki, a French-Iranian, preventing them from leaving Iran. Ebadi and the human rights groups expressed grave concerns for the health and safety of the detainees as well as the two journalists trapped in Iran. Esfandiari and Tajbakhsh are currently being held in ward 209 of Evin prison. On May 29, 2007, the Judiciary's spokesperson, Alireza Jamshidi, told a news conference that they and Azima had been charged after a complaint was made against them by the Information Ministry. It accuses them of "acting against national security by engaging in propaganda against the Islamic republic by the method of spying on behalf of foreigners." Agents of the Information Ministry arrested Esfandiari on May 8. The 67-year-old director of the Middle East program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, DC, was transferred to Evin prison the same day. Tajbakhsh, a 45-year-old social scientist who consulted for the Iranian government as well as international organizations, was detained three days later, on May 11. Both are being detained incommunicado and denied access to their lawyers or family. On May 20, the Information Ministry issued a statement accusing Esfandiari of promoting civil society in Iran "to further the interests of foreign powers." This statement and a number of articles in the hardline daily have referred to the professional activities of Esfandiari and Tajbakhsh, such as attending international scholarly conferences, as evidence of "acting against national security." "These charges are politically motivated and only serve to further isolate Iranian civil society," Ebadi said. "The government is punishing these detainees because they promoted dialogue between Iranians and the international community." Shakeri, 59, "disappeared" on May 8 as he was leaving Iran for Europe. According to his associates, he called his family 48 hours later to say that "there was a misunderstanding, and I am OK." On May 29, the Judiciary's spokesperson said "Shakeri is not in detention, and there are no charges against him." However, Shakeri's whereabouts remain unknown. The international organizations called on the Iranian government to investigate Shakeri's initial detention on May 8, to make public his current whereabouts and to release him if he is in detention, and allow him to leave the country to join his family in California. The authorities have also banned two journalists with dual nationality from leaving Iran. Solouki, a Quebec University journalism student who has dual French and Iranian nationality, was detained on February 17 while making a documentary film about events following the 1988 ceasefire in the war between Iran and Iraq. She was held for a month at Evin prison by Information Ministry officials who also confiscated her notes and film, and then released on bail of 100 million Touman (US$100,000) on March 19. However, the authorities did not return her passport, preventing her from leaving Iran. Intelligence officials have summoned her for interrogation several times since her release. Azima, a reporter for the Persian-language services of Radio Free Europe who holds both Iranian and American citizenship, is also being prevented from leaving Iran. Her passport was confiscated by the authorities in January 2007. On May 21, following the deposit of a large bail payment, the authorities refused to return her passport, citing the interest in her case by the Information Ministry. Iranian intelligence agents often bring politically motivated charges of "endangering national security" against activists and intellectuals. Agents of the Information Ministry arrested Abdolfattah Soltani, a prominent human rights lawyer, in August 2005, accusing him of spying. The ministry's agents held Soltani in Evin prison for seven months, before releasing him on bail. On May 28, 2007, an appeals court in Tehran acquitted Soltani of all charges. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Federation for Human Rights, Reporters Without Borders, and Ebadi reminded the Iranian authorities that they bear full responsibility for the health and safety of all those detained by the state, and that all detainees must be treated with dignity and allowed access to their lawyers and visitors. They also called on the Iranian government to end its persecution and prosecution of dual-national scholars and journalists.

The views expressed are the author's alone. JERUSALEM, 31 May 2007 (IRIN) - A new report issued on Monday by the International Labour Organization (ILO) says seven out of 10 households in the occupied Palestinian territories, or about 2.4 million Palestinians, are living in poverty. It says the workers' situation has continued to worsen dramatically over the past year. According to the report, entitled The Situation of Workers of the Occupied Arab Territories, the Israeli-imposed "closures [checkpoints and movement restrictions] are the main cause of the worsening socio-economic situation of Palestinian women and men." These restrictions on the freedom of movement, which intensified in 2006, the report says, have adversely affected labourers, and products cannot be moved on domestic or international markets. Israel says it needs the checkpoints to ensure the safety of its citizens. Hasan Barghouthi from the Democracy and Workers' Rights Centre in Ramallah in the West Bank said he was not surprised by the ILO findings. "The checkpoints create poverty. People are suffering because of this poverty," he said. A recent report by the World Bank echoed these sentiments, and indicated that Palestinians cannot hope for any economic growth without a significant change in the closure policy. "In economic terms, the restrictions have&#133; stymied growth and investment which is necessary to fuel economic revival," the World Bank wrote in its report entitled Movement and Access Restrictions (May 2007). Barghouthi said growth was desperately needed: "About 65 per cent of Palestinians live on less than US $2 a day. In the Gaza Strip, where the majority of the population were refugees, this figure was over 80 per cent," he said. The ILO report also said the inability of the Palestinian Authority (PA) to pay wages to its employees since March 2006 was having a devastating effect. Over one million people, out of an estimated total population of 3.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, depended on these salaries. The PA has been subjected to an international boycott, including a freezing of aid money, since the Islamic Hamas movement rose to power in last year's elections and refused to recognise Israel and renounce violence. In addition, Israel refuses to hand over taxes it collects for the PA, compounding the fiscal crisis. Shlomo Dror, from the office of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories at the Israeli Ministry of Defence, said: "The new PA government does not recognise Israel and, therefore, the meetings needed to facilitate the transfer of tax funds cannot be conducted." The ILO further said the non-payment of wages had led to public sector strikes which had disrupted delivery of vital services, including in the health and education sectors, and this "has contributed to social and institutional erosion." Hana Zohar, from the Israeli Workers' Hotline (Kav LaOved), said that given this situation, the Israeli government decision to limit the number of Palestinians able to work inside Israel had led to further complications for workers. Workers from Gaza were unable to work in Israel. "The government has also decided that by 2008 no Palestinians will work inside Israel. This means more and more of them are working in Israeli settlements in the West Bank," she said, in line with the ILO report, which added that this change in labour patterns was an active policy initiated by the Israeli government. The ILO called the settlements "illegal under international law". Zohar said this change meant Palestinian workers were more likely to be abused. Low pay, poor conditions "About 90 per cent of Palestinian workers don't receive the minimum wage, in part because there is no government enforcement in the West Bank," Zohar said, basing her comments on her organisation's research. "In some cases, Israeli employers withhold wages for months" adding to the poverty problems. "But besides this, the conditions are the worst thing. Unsafe. In some cases, they work with chemicals in plastic factories without any protection," she said. In essence, some Palestinian labourers endanger their health without even getting paid. However, Dror, from the Israeli Ministry of Defence, said: "Any Palestinian can turn to an Israeli court, if he feels his rights are violated. And many in fact do exactly that." He also said work permits are issued based on the demands of employers, and his office increased the number of Palestinians working for Israeli businesses, regardless of job location. "How many states would even let people at war with them work in their country at all?" he asked. Dror added that the ILO report ignored many of Israel's security needs and concerns. Zohar said that ultimately Israel should realise that if it did not allow Palestinians to earn a living, it would be responsible, under international humanitarian law, to care for them and their needs.

The Quartet of Middle East peacemakers, which includes Russia, the US, the UN and the EU, urged Wednesday to end fighting between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, calling on the PA government to "do everything necessary to restore law and order." The group, which met in Berlin, also urged "all Palestinians to immediately renounce all acts of violence and respect the cease-fire."

"The resolution, as much as it constitutes a violation of the Lebanese state and an attack on its internal affairs, it is contrary to legal rules and the charters and principles of the United Nations and the objectives for which it was established to achieve," said a statement issued by the group. "Therefore, it (the resolution) amounts to a flagrant violation that makes the resolution illegal and illegitimate at the national and international level," the statement said. The U.N. Security Council voted late Wednesday to approve the tribunal, bypassing Lebanon&#039;s parliament which has failed to meet to endorse it. The Shiite Muslim militant group has previously warned against the creation of the tribunal under the militarily enforceable Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter. Today in Africa &#038; Middle East Jihadist groups fill a Palestinian power vacuum UN Security Council approves Hariri tribunal Sunni-Kurdish conflict worsens Iraqi disarray Separately, Mahmoud Komati, deputy leader of Hezbollah&#039;s political bureau, said on Al-Arabiya television that the resolution "was a violation of Lebanese sovereignty because the Security Council regarded Lebanon as lacking constitutional institutions and without state authority." The Hezbollah statement said the resolution placed Lebanon under "international tutelage, without decision-making and sovereignty in an unprecedented development in the history of sovereign states." The pro-Syrian and pro-Iranian group said the government was giving "a glorious favor" to the U.S. administration through which it could use Lebanon as a card that could be used to exert political pressure. Hezbollah insisted the creation of the tribunal would not help solve the political crisis buffeting Lebanon. It called on the pro-government faction "to realize that the real crisis has always been over political participation in decision-making among all Lebanese factions. Hezbollah and its opposition allies have demanded a veto-wielding share in the Cabinet. Prime Minister Fuad Saniora, backed by the anti-Syrian majority, has rejected the demand and has resisted an opposition campaign to step down.

Thaksin, deposed in a September coup, was last night judged to have violated election laws in an April 2006 snap poll by a junta-appointed tribunal. The nine judges disbanded his Thai Rak Thai party and slapped five-year political bans on 111 of its executives. Thailand&#39;s junta, which wants to pass a new constitution via referendum before elections promised for December, may find it hard to get support from the millions of Thais who gave Thaksin a record mandate of 377 of 500 parliamentary seats in 2005. The exiled leader called the ruling harsh and unexpected. ``The confrontation that we&#39;ve had in Thailand over the past two years is now likely to deepen,&#39;&#39; said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. ``There&#39;s a very large electorate that has been left dangling.&#39;&#39; ``It is certain that people around the country won&#39;t accept this ruling,&#39;&#39; Chaturon Chaisang, acting leader of Thai Rak Thai, told supporters at the party headquarters in Bangkok last night. ``The country is under the rule of military dictators. The country is under a regime that is not acceptable in the international community.&#39;&#39; The same judges absolved the Democrat Party of offenses including preventing parties from contesting last year&#39;s election via a boycott. Members of that party, Thailand&#39;s oldest and Thaksin&#39;s main opposition when he was in power, will be able to take part in planned December elections. ``This is a huge political windfall for the Democrat Party&#39;&#39; said Thitinan of Chulalongkorn University. ``They lost recent elections. Now the Democrat Party looks like they will lead the next coalition.&#39;&#39; Among 44 political parties listed on the Web site of the Office of the Election Commission of Thailand as of February, Thai Rak Thai was the largest, with 14.4 million members. The Democrat Party was second biggest with 4.1 million members. Korn Chatikavanij, deputy secretary-general of the Democrat Party in Thailand, said that his party was ``sympathetic&#39;&#39; to Thai Rak Thai members and would ``reach out to them.&#39;&#39; Thaksin, in a statement issued by his lawyer Noppadol Pattama, said the verdict ``will be studied and criticized for a long time&#39;&#39; and called on the junta to return democracy to the people quickly. He called on Thai Rak Thai members to continue with political activity ``for the benefit of the country.&#39;&#39; ``People have been quiet so far,&#39;&#39; said James McCormack, head of Asian sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings. ``But the first opportunity people have to voice an opinion is this referendum that&#39;s coming up in the middle of the year.&#39;&#39; Bangkok was peaceful during the reading of the verdict Wednesday afternoon and night and on Thursday. Thailand&#39;s junta deployed more than 10,000 soldiers and police in the capital, and said today it would maintain an indefinite national security clampdown, according to AFP. ``Security measures have been stepped up since last night and will gradually be increased,&#39;&#39; Army Chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin told the news agency. ``The measures will be in place for a long time.&#39;&#39; The tribunal last night found Pongsak Raktapongpaisal, Thaksin&#39;s former transport minister, and Thammarak Isarangura Na Ayutthaya, his ex-defense minister, guilty of paying candidates from smaller parties to run in an April 2006 election that was later annulled. The two small parties are the Thai Ground Party and Pattana Chartthai Party, the judges said. ``Banning those executives is aimed at preventing them from having a chance to cause damage to the country again,&#39;&#39; Judge Krairerk Kasemsant said while delivering the verdict, broadcast on state-controlled radio and television. With staunch support from Thailand&#39;s majority rural voters, Thai Rak Thai, or `Thais Love Thais&#39; captured a record number of parliamentary seats in Feb. 2005 elections, delivering the first absolute majority in the country&#39;s history and making Thaksin the first prime minister elected for two consecutive terms. Thaksin&#39;s overthrow followed months of protests against his rule and the election he called in an attempt to quell them. That vote was boycotted by the opposition and later voided for the charges ruled on yesterday. To contact the reporters on this story: Dominic G.

However, Roh said he believed Pyongyang&#039;s nuclear program was strictly a bargaining chip and that leader Kim Jong Il would give up his bombs if appropriate conditions were met: security guarantees, aid and normal relations with the U.S. "North Korea harbors huge anxieties or fears toward the United States and (South Korea). And in this climate, North Korea, I believe, chose the development of a nuclear program and with this nuclear program I believe they try to use it as a negotiating tool," Roh said during an interview with AP President and CEO Tom Curley. "This was a political strategy." Roh, whose term expires in February, also said there could be time while he&#039;s in office to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il &#8212; but only if the North moves to abandon its nuclear program. International talks on North Korea&#039;s nuclear program have been beset by repeated delays since the crisis erupted in late 2002, and most recently are deadlocked over some US$25 million (&#8364;18.6 million) in North Korean accounts frozen in a Macau bank. That bank was blacklisted in 2005 by Washington for alleged complicity in counterfeiting U.S. dollars and money laundering by the Pyongyang regime. Today in Asia - Pacific Thailand facing uncertainty after court ruling An escapee tells of life and death in North Korea&#x27;s labor camps U.S. and India closer to nuclear agreement Washington agreed to help free the money to win North Korea&#039;s promise to shut down its sole operating nuclear reactor by mid-April and eventually dismantle its weapons program. But the money has not yet been withdrawn because other banks have shunned the tainted funds &#8212; and North Korea has refused to lock down its reactor until it gets the money. Roh said the South had hoped to intervene to resolve the dispute. He did not elaborate, but local news reports have said Seoul was considering asking a South Korean bank to be the middleman for getting the money to a North Korean account. "We have offered to help in resolving the (bank) issue to both sides, but after our offer there has not been an answer from either side," he said, referring to Washington and Pyongyang. The top U.S. negotiator on North Korea, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill, appealed Thursday for Pyongyang to shut down its reactor regardless of the financial dispute. But after meetings with Chinese nuclear envoy Wu Dawei in Beijing, he said there was no new resolution to that matter. To help relax regional tension, Roh also left open the possibility of holding a summit with the North&#039;s Kim, which would follow the first-and-only such meeting between the two Koreas in 2000 between Kim and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. However, he said such talks could not go forward without movement at the six-nation North Korea nuclear talks, which also include China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States. Talk of a North-South summit has percolated recently in Seoul, drawing fire from opponents as an inappropriate political ploy to help boost Roh&#039;s liberals ahead of December presidential elections. "Regardless of my term, I believe a good time would be when the six-party talks are well on (their) way to implementation and when we can be sure that a summit will contribute to cementing this progress," Roh said. Ties cooled between the two Koreas last year after North Korea tested a barrage of missiles in July and tensions deepened after Pyongyang conducted its first-ever nuclear test in October. The Koreas resumed efforts at rapprochement after the North pledged initial steps toward nuclear disarmament. Those efforts have also been put on hold over the North&#039;s delay in shutting down its nuclear reactor. A high-level delegation from North Korea was in Seoul for reconciliation talks set to end Friday, where the South has insisted the North start to dismantle its weapons program before Seoul delivers promised aid. Roh said Seoul would continue to press the North to disarm, using aid as leverage. South Korea has drawn criticism at home and abroad over its "sunshine policy" of continued engagement even as Pyongyang refuses to back down from nuclear weapons development. "The fact that the Korean government is practicing the &#039;sunshine policy&#039; toward North Korea does not mean that we forfeit all rights to take issue with North Korea&#039;s missile launches and nuclear test," Roh said. "Although we fully embrace the &#039;sunshine policy,&#039; I believe that what has to be said, has to be said."

It’s astounding to an observer what Israel, a sovereign country and strong military force in the region, is willing to subject itself and its citizens to on a daily basis. The contortionist-like movements of the current government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert should be allowed to qualify for some kind of international circus act. The big news out of the area on Tuesday morning was that the nearly powerless Pales­tinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, is planning to meet with the almost as politically weak Mr. Olmert. What will this meeting be about, anyway? Will they discuss once again how to effectuate a cease-fire between the two sides? Additionally, why is this being discussed with Mr. Abbas, who represents Fatah, when it seems (to those capable of discerning the difference) that the missiles into Israel are being fired by people he does not represent or wield any influence over—like Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and assorted other terrorist corporate entities. In the meantime, as a people—no matter where we reside, in Israel or here—we’ve become successfully desensitized to the deaths and injuries in Sderot, as long as they are luridly kept to a tiny minimum that apparently does not warrant any effective or serious Israeli military response or diplomatic outrage in Israel, America, or anywhere else in the civilized world. What can possibly be achieved by an Olmert–Abbas meeting—other than to raise Olmert’s embarrassingly low popularity rating with the Israeli public as we pick up speed in the direction of early elections in Israel? What will Abbas have to say about Gilad Shalit, who has been held hostage in Gaza for close to a year now, right under Mr. Abbas’s nose? What will Mr. Abbas have to say about the arrest by Israeli forces earlier this week of the terrorist Khaled Shawish, whom Israel has been looking for since 2002 when he oversaw the murder of Binyamin and Taliye Kahane, the children of the murdered Rabbi Meir Kahane? The Kahane couple were shot and killed as they were returning home after spending a Shabbos in Jerusalem, leaving behind six orphans. Shawish had been protected from the IDF, first by Yasser Arafat and then over the last several years by Mr. Abbas, the great purveyor of peace. Israel does not want to send forces into Gaza to wipe out the terrorist infrastructure there mostly because of pressure from the U.S. and Europe to give the Palestinians the opportunity to police themselves. You don’t have to belong to a military think tank to realize that this idea has been a miserable failure from the beginning. The notion hangs out there that the only thing that can bring all the murderous factions from continuing to ply their trade on one another is an all-out attack from Israel. The Olmert government feels that after last summer’s Lebanon fiasco, he cannot afford politically to get Israel’s forces mired in another Arab-Israeli conflict. So far, the price paid for this course has been only a few deaths, some injured, and the paralysis and traumatization of Sderot. One Israeli military officer told Haaretz this week that if the attacks and fighting remain at this level, they are tolerable. Then he said, “If they hit a kindergarten with a missile and kill children, then all bets are off.” Is this a wild approach, or what? In the meantime, they sit and wait. Clearly, there is a game of international intrigue being played—a form of an everyday street game of chicken. While Israel can pulverize Gaza and bomb them into submission, Hamas and their partners also possess the firepower and missiles that can be fired deeper into Israel. So both are exercising some restraint, but it’s absurd that Israel, one of the world’s leading military powers, is willing to subject itself to this type of bloody charade. The hope is, of course, to use power to get each side to sit and talk and make real concessions to one another. Not included in the equation is the reality that rarely has a Palestinian governing entity entered into an agreement that it was able to abide by. That’s where Mr. Abbas comes into the picture, being the one capable of projecting an image of being the least violence-oriented of all Palestinian leaders throughout their rather brief history. In the past, Israeli leaders would not have tolerated this type of wanton victimization of the civilian population. Prior to the deception of the Oslo Accords, the Israeli response to missiles being shot at civilians would have been both fast and fatal for the enemy. Today in the Middle East, violence has become a tool of diplomacy rather than war. Israel knows this all too well, but feels that she has no choice, because the U.S., bowing to the pressures of Saudi Arabia and others, constantly coaxes and cajoles Israel into giving diplomacy another try—and another, again and again, usually with no positive result. It’s also interesting that now that the U.S. has begun to try a new approach by meeting with representatives of Iran and Syria in forums—ostensibly for the better good of Iraq—they are about to find out what the word of an Islamic leader really means. Just prior to the U.S. meeting with the Iranian representative in Baghdad, the Iranians issued an order to step up their support and activity on behalf of the terrorist insurgents in Iraq. The plan, according to debka.com, was so that when they would sit down with the Americans, they could immediately concede to the scaling back of their support of terror without losing much ground in their terror war offensive against U.S. troops. Perhaps the good news, if there is any, is that the U.S. is about to find out through hard experience what Israel has been experiencing since Oslo in 1993. And that is that agreements that other Middle Eastern leaders enter into—whether it’s Oslo, or the Road Map, or any other—are not taken seriously and remain wholly unfulfilled. The question is how the U.S. will act as future agreements with the Iranians, the Syrians, and eventually the Iraqis are not just unfulfilled but blatantly violated. Will the American government at that point still insist that Israel keep its part of agreements, though they are being broken by the other side, so as to build up the dwindling strength of leaders like Abbas? Still further in this unfolding crooked equation is the notion that the press—and in particular the New York Times—loves to report on whether Israel’s response to the firing of missiles is a “proportionate response” or not. The Times likes very much to declare that Israel is using undue and disproportionate force in responding to Palestinian attacks on Sderot. This past Sunday and in several other dispatches from Israel, the Times makes sure to report that since the violence has escalated, more than fifty Palestinians have been killed and two Israelis have been killed. The idea promoted is that Israel is misusing its overwhelming strength against Palestinian makeshift, homemade rockets. It would be an absurd suggestion, not to be taken seriously, if not for the fact that almost no one takes it seriously except for the Israelis. My goodness, what happened to a straight-shooting military and straight-shooting leadership? It seems that today only in Israel does a leader check his poll numbers and his prospects for reelection before asking the military to do its job of protecting the country’s citizens. If not for the tragic results, the entire situation would be laughable. 5tjt.com all rights reserved

Jakarta governor Sutiyoso cut short his trip to Sydney and demanded an apology after saying police had entered his hotel room uninvited as he slept. He said they wanted him to testify at an inquest into the deaths of five journalists in East Timor in 1975. New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma said he was "disturbed" by the report. "I apologise for the distress and inconvenience caused and regret your early departure from New South Wales," he wrote in a letter to Gov Sutiyoso, made public to news outlets. He said a review of the circumstances surrounding the incident revealed the state's "co-ordination of security and protocol was less than satisfactory". "This is extremely disappointing to me," he added. The apology appears to have dampened diplomatic tensions that had risen over the incident. Indonesia had lodged a formal protest. Gov Sutiyoso had been in Sydney at the invitation of the state government when police allegedly entered his hotel room as he slept. "They barged into my room after forcing the hotel to give them a duplicate key," he told reporters after returning to Jakarta. He said they asked him to sign an invitation to testify at the inquest into the five journalists who were killed in the East Timor town of Balibo on October 1975. Australia and Indonesia have always said the journalists died accidentally, having been caught in crossfire as Indonesian troops entered the town. A senior lawyer told the inquest on Wednesday that far from being an accident, the journalists deliberately shot by Indonesian troops after they tried to surrender, according to the testimony of witnesses. Gov Sutiyoso, a former general, said he had served in East Timor in 1975 but was never stationed in Balibo.

Lavrov, accused the United States of starting a new arms race and implicitly threatened to veto any United Nations Security Council resolution that, like the one proposed by the United States and its European allies, would recognize the independence of Kosovo. Even as the White House and the Kremlin were announcing plans for a rare kiss-and-make-up meeting between President Bush and President , their top diplomats were clashing here in the historic castle where Churchill, Truman and met to decide how to carve up Germany after World War II. This time, the big issue was the carving up of the former Yugoslavia, where the mostly Albanian-inhabited province of Kosovo wants to secede from Serbia. That, along with the American plan to place antimissile bases in Poland and the Czech Republic, has pitted Russia against the West in a war of words with flashbacks to the cold war. Mr. Lavrov harshly criticized Washington&#8217;s plan to build a missile shield over countries that were once part of the Soviet sphere of influence. And he took issue with Secretary of State for calling Russian concerns about it ludicrous. &#8220;All they&#8217;re saying is, &#8216;Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s not aimed at you,&#8217; &#8221; Mr. Lavrov said at a news conference after the meeting. &#8220;It&#8217;s such answers that are ludicrous.&#8221; &#8220;We quite agree,&#8221; Ms. Rice said with a sly smile, countering that Russian officials themselves have bragged that their strategic defense systems can easily overwhelm any missile defense system that the United States puts up in Europe. Mr. Lavrov was having none of it. &#8220;I hope that no one has to prove that Condi is right about that,&#8221; he interjected. Their clashes are indicative of a chill in their countries&#8217; relations. In February, Mr. Putin delivered a blistering speech accusing the United States of undermining international institutions and making the Middle East more unstable through its clumsy handling of the Iraq war. Russia is also deeply unhappy about the expansion of into the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and about the perception in Russia that the West has supported groups that have toppled other governments in Moscow&#8217;s former sphere of influence. Mr. Bush, Ms. Rice and Secretary of Defense have tried, without success, to reassure the Russians that the missile system is aimed at preventing attack by the likes of Iran or North Korea. The tensions have heightened to the point that the two countries have decided to hold a one-on-one session between Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush on July 1 in Kennebunkport, Me. But it is hard to see how that will tone down the sparring, given how far apart the two behemoths are on Kosovo. The United States and its Western European allies favor a draft resolution endorsing supervised independence for Kosovo, where a NATO bombing campaign in 1999 helped defeat Serbian forces. Russia is adamantly opposed. At the meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Lavrov repeatedly questioned why the United States was so intent on resolving Kosovo&#8217;s status when other areas of the world were in dispute. &#8220;Lavrov said, &#8216;Why don&#8217;t we solve the case of Western Sahara first?&#8217; &#8221; said a European official who was at the session, speaking on condition of anonymity under customary diplomatic rules. &#8220;He even brought up Abkhazia,&#8221; the obscure Black Sea region that has been trying to secede from Georgia. &#8220;And every time Lavrov said something, Condi would jump in,&#8221; the official said. &#8220;It was like tennis.&#8221; Mr. Lavrov did not tone down his ire over the Kosovo plan after the meeting, when the foreign ministers held their news conference and most tried to act cordial. He hinted, as Russian officials have before, that Russia would veto any Security Council resolution seeking to recognize Kosovo as an independent country, unless Serbia agreed first, which diplomats said was very unlikely. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine a situation where the Security Council will approve such a resolution,&#8221; Mr. Lavrov said. &#8220;Such a situation will not happen.&#8221; A senior Bush administration official acknowledged that the administration, in more than six years, had not figured out how to manage its relationship with Russia. &#8220;There are a lot of things we have that are of common interest, and at the same time, we need to push where necessary,&#8221; said the official, speaking anonymously under diplomatic rules. &#8220;And to be able to do both things at the same time is hard, particularly for American administrations. We either tend to do one or the other, and for this to work we have to do both.&#8221; More Articles in International &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Several of the top diplomats gathering in the eastern city of Potsdam were due to travel to nearby Berlin for a meeting of the Quartet on Middle East peace, grouping the US, the UN, the EU and Russia later Wednesday. The Potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the Group of Eight most industrialized nations in Heiligendamm, northeast Germany, June 6-8. The ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the North Korean nuclear program, strife-torn Afghanistan and the future status of Kosovo. Although the environment was not on the official agenda, Japan poured cold water on a German proposal to complete negotiations on a successor to the Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gases by 2009, calling it "premature." Chancellor Angela Merkel has staked Germany's 12-month presidency of the G8 on hammering out a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting the emission of greenhouse gases -- a prospect Washington has rejected out of hand. The future status of Kosovo, an issue that bitterly divides Russia and the West, also sparked a heated discussion in Potsdam. Russia rejects proposals by chief UN negotiator Martti Ahtisaari to grant Kosovo internationally supervised independence from Serbia. "The fate of Serbia, the fate of Kosovo, should not be decided in New York, not in Potsdam and not in other formats but rather in direct negotiations between the two sides," Lavrov told his G8 counterparts. He firmly rejected a call by Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany for Russia to cooperate with international partners on the issue. The participants of the G8 foreign ministers meeting pose for a family picture in the eastern German city of Potsdam. Make Alalam your homepage Copyright © 2004 - 2007 Alalam Inc.

Thaksin tells supporters to accept party ban BANGKOK: A constitutional court has banned the political party of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra after finding it guilty of election fraud, in a ruling that could throw Thai politics into disarray. But Mr Thaksin on Wednesday urged his stunned supporters to accept the ruling. In a statement read by his lawyer in Bangkok, he also urged the generals who ousted him in a bloodless coup last September to speed up elections promised for December. "As founder who led the party until the coup, I must apologise to party members, the executive committee and every supporter for an unexpected outcome," Thaksin said. "I would urge everyone to stay calm and don't make any moves." The court barred Mr Thaksin and 110 other executives of the party from participating in politics for five years, removing from the scene some of Thailand's most powerful politicians. The prospect of Mr Thaksin's return to power and the resurgence of his party has been one of the chief concerns of the country's military leaders. The court ruled that the party, Thai Rak Thai, was guilty of paying small parties to stand against it in an election in April last year to satisfy a requirement for minimum participation. "It used parliamentary elections only as a means to achieve totalitarian power," Judge Vichai Chuenchompoonuj said. "It goes to show that the defendant does not believe in the democratic system. It also shows no respect for the rule of law, which is key to the democratic system." The nine-member court accused Mr Thaksin of using the party for his own gain and said the party had no ideology beyond its leader's ambitions. The rival Democrat Party, Thailand's oldest, was found not guilty of breaking the laws. Security was tight in Bangkok as the verdicts were read, but tension was much less than security officials had predicted. The announcement was greeted with cries and tears at Thai Rak Thai headquarters. Party leaders have said that if Thai Rak Thai was disbanded, they would come together in a new party. But a ban on participation of many of their executives was a serious blow to that plan.

Mr Berezovsky shed light on his relationship with the former FSB agent Andrei Lugovoy just before the Russian prosecutor general's office announced that swapping the two men for trial had been ruled out. Mr Berezovsky is wanted in Russia on fraud charges while Britain wants to extradite Mr Lugovoy on suspicion of murdering Mr Litvinenko, a former Russian agent, with the radioactive polonium-210. Speaking at the Miller Academy on Tuesday night, Mr Berezovsky said that he had known Mr Lugovoy, his former bodyguard, "for a long time", and trusted him. Following Mr Litvinenko's death last November, Mr Lugovoy telephoned the billionaire. "I told him - if you are not guilty, you should come to this country - go to Heathrow and talk to Scotland Yard. There is no chance you will go to jail if you are not guilty. I told him there was a polonium trail all over Europe, including in my office, and that he had to explain it. "I got no answer" from Mr Lugovoy, said Mr Berezovsky, adding that "all the steps of Lugovoy just confirm that he is behind" the poisoning. But he said that he still felt uneasy about Mr Lugovoy's role in the killing, as the former agent had previously protected Mr Berezovsky and his family in Russia, as well as the former pro-reform prime minister Yegor Gaidar. Mr Lugovoy denies any connection to the Litvinenko murder, which followed a meeting between the two men and a third former Russian security agent, Dmitri Kovtun, at a hotel in London. "Even now I have a strange impression," said Mr Berezovsky, who did not give further details but hinted that Mr Lugovoy may have been coerced into the murder. He pointed out that the former agent had been imprisoned in 2001 after attempting to spring from jail an associate of Mr Berezovsky, the former deputy director of Aeroflot Nikolai Glushkov, who had been imprisoned for fraud. Last week Mr Berezovsky told a reporter that Mr Lugovoy's life may be in danger because he was a "witness of Putin's crime". Mr Berezovsky has frequently accused the Russian President of being behind the murder of his employee, Mr Litvinenko, who also accused Mr Putin of his murder in a deathbed statement. On Tuesday evening, he repeated the accusation but denied that he had become an embarrassing guest for Britain which granted him political asylum in 2003. In a recent interview with The Guardian, he had called for the use of force to remove President Putin from power. Mr Berezovsky argued that on the contrary, thanks to his efforts, the West was now more aware of the "real danger" posed by President Putin. "In 2001, only 10 per cent thought he was dangerous in the West. Now it is 90 per cent," Mr Berezovsky said, adding that he feared for his own safety following Mr Litvinenko's death. Asked what Britain should do if Russia continued to refuse to extradite the suspect for trial, Mr Berezovsky replied: "This is not just a problem for Britain, this is a problem for the West." He suggested that economic sanctions could be invoked. Russia points out that it is constitutionally barred from extraditing a Russian citizen for trial abroad, but has offered to put Mr Lugovoy on trial in Moscow. Britain has ruled that out.

"With Asia-Pacific now home to two thirds of the world's population, the level of progress achieved in your region will be a critical factor in determining whether our global efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will succeed or fail," he sai, in a message delivered by Jose Antonio Ocampo, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Monday. Officials from 62 United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) member governments are in Almaty for the week-long meeting 60 years after the body, then known as the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, was founded in Shanghai. The MDGs, time-bound targets for slashing poverty and other ills by the year 2015, are at the top of the meeting's agenda. "I am encouraged by the fact that, in recent decades, the countries of Asia and the Pacific have seen a record number of people lifted out of poverty," Ban said. "Still, over 600 million fellow human beings who have not benefited from the region's economic gains continue to face a daily struggle to survive," he added. He urged redoubled efforts to fight extreme poverty within UNESCAP's &#8220;Green Growth,&#8221; or environmentally sustainable approach. To help the countries which are lagging behind, government ministers from across the region have expressed support for a "road map that aims to have all countries 'marginally' off-track to be back on-track towards reaching MDGs by 2009, those 'moderately' off-track to be in line by 2011, and those in the 'severely' off-track category on target by the end of 2013. At the meeting, Kim Hak-Su, Executive Secretary of UNESCAP, applauded the endorsement of the plan. "Your commitment is vital to the regional road map," he told the ministers. "2007 marks the midway point to 2015. It is important that the countries come together to ensure the targets are met," he said. The road-map is expected to be endorsed by the Commission session when it concludes on Wednesday, 23 May.

Who's your fave? Golly! Are retro dolls racist? Are you too fat for NHS ops? McClaren: Is he a 'joke'? COMMENT ON THIS STORY BRAVE Kate McCann fought tears as she told the Pope yesterday: &#147;We need to find Madeleine.&#148; The grief-stricken mother&#146;s voice was barely audible as she made her impassioned plea. Battling to stay in control, Kate stood before His Holiness Benedict XVI during the open-air audience in historic St Peter&#146;s Square. With husband Gerry by her side, she murmured: &#147;Thank you from all of us just so want need to find Madeleine.&#148; Then her voice faltered as tears began to well, while The Pontiff stretched out his hands &#151; and gently clasped hers. The Pope whispered back his reassurance. And Kate replied: &#147;I know that. Yes.&#148; He took Gerry&#146;s hand too and the distraught dad bowed to kiss the Holy Father&#146;s. Kate offered: &#147;Father. Do you, er, want to see a picture of Madeleine?&#148; As the picture of the smiling four-year-old was passed to the Pope, he recognised it as the image that has touched millions around the world. Kate said, &#147;That&#146;s her. Yes&#148;, as she pressed it into his hands. Concern ... the Holy Father listens to Kate and, right, McCanns appeal to Italian people for help Then in a final act of comfort for the devout Roman Catholic couple, The Pope blessed the picture with a sign of the cross. &#147;Thank you,&#148; Kate whispered, her voice tailing off. The GP had been clutching Maddie&#146;s favourite pink stuffed toy, Cuddle Cat, as the Pontiff offered words of comfort. And she said of the 30-second meeting: &#147;He was very kind, very sincere. He said he would pray for us and our family and continue to have faith for us for Madeleine&#146;s safe return to us. &#147;I thanked him first of all for letting us meet him for his prayers. It has been a lovely day. &#147;It was a very positive experience. I think it has only made us stronger and lifted us up more. Maddie ... missing for past 28 days &#147;There is so much good out there. It is really evident and it has really helped us.&#148; Gerry, a hospital consultant, added: &#147;It was more personal than I could ever imagine it could have been. &#147;His touch, words and thoughts were more tender than we could have thought. &#147;In other circumstances, of course, it would be the highlight for any Catholic to meet the Pope. &#147;But it is tainted with the very marked realisation that our daughter is still missing.&#148; He added: &#147;One evil act with the abduction of Madeleine seems to have generated so much good. It has restored my faith in humanity.&#148; The couple had waited for two hours at the front of 30,000 pilgrims at the general audience. They struggled to stay composed amid the pomp and pageantry. And at one point Kate buckled when an English priest read out a special papal blessing for &#147;your children and your loved ones&#148;. They arrived in Rome on a private jet from Portugal and stayed overnight in the residence of the British Ambassador to the Vatican. And they were among only around 50 pilgrims given the honour of a personal papal meeting. Yet amid the sea of smiling faces, they stood out because of their tears. Kate stayed composed by toying with a set of black rosary beads. She frequently looked down at two photos of Maddie, while Gerry slipped a comforting arm around her waist and squeezed her shoulder. At other times he held her close whenever her burden of pain appeared too great. Kate kept her head bowed at one point as little girls &#151; not much older than Maddie &#151; laughed excitedly in seats beside her as the Pope neared. A Vatican spokesman, the Reverend Ciro Benedettini, said the Pope was happy to meet the couple after a request from British Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O&#146;Connor. He said: &#147;We are talking about a family drama that has touched world public opinion. &#147;It could not but touch the Holy Father, especially since these people are Catholics. The Holy Father is considered the father of all, therefore he was personally touched as a father.&#148; Last night the couple, from Rothley, Leicestershire, jetted back to Portugal to be reunited with their two-year-old twins Amelie and Sean. Kate said: &#147;We just can&#146;t even think about going home. Our total preoccupation is finding Madeleine. &#147;At the end of the day this is for Madeleine. I don&#146;t like talking about this publicly but you have got to put your own feelings aside. &#147;You can never lose sight of what we are trying to do &#151; find Madeleine.&#148; Gerry added: &#147;We&#146;re still in the middle of a race and we do not know how long it is going to be. I don&#146;t know how we will have changed but we will never be the same again.&#148; Email to a friend FULL MADDIE INDEX &#155;&#155; Send your messages of support.

Residents of Sadr City, the northern suburb that is a stronghold of the al-Mahdi Army, the Shia militia suspected of carrying out the abductions, said that an early morning helicopter strike had killed two people while US commanders said two suspected terrorists had been detained. Dozens of Bradley fighting vehicles and Humvees carried US troops into the Shia district last night where they continued their so-far fruitless house-to-house searches. A cleric who runs the Sadr City political office of Hojatoleslam Moqtada al-Sadr, the spiritual head of the al-Mahdi Army, said his building was stormed at 3am. Witnesses said the two people who died were an elderly couple sleeping on their roof to avoid the heat. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said there had been no major overnight developments in the search for the four British security guards and IT consultant who were taken hostage in carefully planned raid on the Iraqi Finance Ministry on Tuesday. Fears are growing for abducted Britons SAS team is diverted to join hunt Iraq holds breath before vital summer A spokeswoman said that Kim Howells, the Foreign Office Minister, was in Basra yesterday and discussed the operation to secure their release with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Hoshiyar Zebari. Meanwhile the Iraqi Government released a statement saying that a special military unit had been set up to help the search and that it had "undertaken urgent measures to determine the facts and locate the kidnappers...The government condemns this crime and is doing all it can to ensure the immediate release of the kidnapped Britons". The FCO spokeswoman said that the British diplomats and military officials in charge of the operation were keeping their minds open as to which insurgent group might have been responsible for the kidnapping, despite a leaked incident report that appeared to point the finger of blame at the al-Mahdi Army, whose Basra leader was killed in a joint British and Iraqi operation last week. "There is obviously lots of speculation but we have to keep an open mind and deal in facts rather than pick one theory over another," she said. The report, obtained by the Associated Press, was reportedly written by Fatih-Allah, the director general of the Finance Ministry's data processing centre, where the Britons were seized, and quoted the top US Commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, saying that the al-Mahdi Army &ldquo;will be profoundly sorry" if it carried out the abductions. The account of the kidnapping said that Iraq&rsquo;s Defence and Interior ministers believed the al-Mahdi Army of being behind the raid and corroborated other witness reports, which described gunmen claiming to be from the Government's anti-corruption body taking the hostages away in a convoy of 19 four-wheel-drive vehicles. The report said that a group of four men in civilian clothes reportedly scouted the Finance Ministry building 15 minutes before the larger party arrived. The al-Mahdi Army is under close scrutiny after the reappearance in Iraq last Friday of Hojatoleslam al-Sadr, their young and charismatic leader, who has been in hiding for the last four months during the massive US-Iraqi security operation considered a last-ditch attempt to stabilise the country. The militia has been reportedly frayed by the cleric's absence, fuelling speculation that the Britons were taken by an extremist splinter group. Meanwhile other reports have claimed that the kidnapping bore the hallmark of Sunni insurgents and that the al-Mahdi Army is not involved at all. In another operation in Baghdad today, US forces, backed by helicopter gunships, fought for several hours with armed men suspected of ties to al-Qaeda. Reports said that al-Qaeda militants, who consider Baghdad&rsquo;s Amariyah neighborhood part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, opened fire on students about to attend their final exams. Iraqi police said that 45 men were detained and the local leader of the militants, known as Haji Hameed, was killed. There was no comment from the US military. Outside the capital, at least 25 people were killed and 50 were wounded when a suicide bomber blew up a police recruiting centre in Fallujah, in unstable Anbar province 65km (40 miles) west of Baghdad. The recruiting centre, in a primary school, had opened on Sunday. "A cleric who runs the Sadr City political office of Hojatoleslam Moqtada al-Sadr...said his building was stormed at 3am. Witnesses said the two people who died were an elderly couple sleeping on their roof to avoid the heat." If you cannot find the abductees, might as well just kill some old people.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/14-3&fd=R&url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/world/asia/30cnd-malaysia.html&cid=1116680910&ei=m-xeRsngAYf40QHv7IzQDQ Malaysian Court Refuses to Recognize Woman&#8217;s Conversion to Christianity - New York Times Malaysian Court Refuses to Recognize Woman’s Conversion to Christianity Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 30, 2007 , May 30 — In a controversial victory for Islamic law over secularism, Malaysia’s highest court today refused to recognize the conversion of a Muslim-born woman to Christianity, ruling that the matter was beyond the jurisdiction of the country’s civil courts and should be handled by religious authorities. Muslims, who make up about 60 percent of Malaysia’s population, have co-existed with Buddhists, Christians, Hindus and Sikhs for decades in this country, considered one of the world’s most progressive and modern Muslim democracies. But the ruling here underlined the increasing separateness of Muslims from people of other religions and reinforced the notion, widely held in many Muslim countries, that Islamic law should have primacy over secular laws in certain aspects of their lives. The Federal Court was divided 2-1 in its decision, with the only non-Muslim judge, Richard Malanjum, dissenting forcefully and arguing that the Constitution must remain the supreme law of the land. The split on the court mirrored the discord in Malaysian society, where ethnic and religious tensions have begun to increase in recent years. The ruling exhausted the last appeal of Lina Joy, who, after being baptized a Roman Catholic in May 1998, wanted to remove the word “Islam” from her identity card in order to marry her Catholic fiancé. Muslims in Malaysia are subject to separate laws on inheritance and marriage — they must marry within the faith — and are not allowed to have premarital relationships or drink alcohol, among other rules. Because separate laws apply to them, Muslims must list their religion on their identity cards. Ms. Joy, who lost her job as a saleswoman last year because of the controversy and whose family has reportedly been harassed, is seeking political asylum in Australia, according to one of her advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for her. Ms. Joy’s lawyer, Benjamin Dawson, was not available after the trial to comment on the verdict or the reported asylum application. Ms. Joy was not in the courtroom today. The Malaysian chief justice, Ahmad Fairuz Abdul Halim, who read out his majority opinion in the packed but respectfully hushed courtroom, said the government agency responsible for identity cards had acted reasonably when it refused to change Ms. Joy’s religious status. ”She cannot at her own whim simply enter or leave her religion,” Mr. Ahmad said. “She must follow rules.” The Malaysian Constitution is in some ways a self-contradicting document, analysts say. It both defends freedom of religion and declares Islam the official religion. The abandonment of Islam, or apostasy, is deplored by many Muslims and in some Malaysian states is punishable by fines and imprisonment. In order for Ms. Joy to officially change her religion, Mr. Ahmad said, she must offer proof from a special Muslim court that she has abandoned Islam. “The civil courts cannot interfere,” Mr. Ahmad said. Mr. Malanjum said in his dissenting opinion that Ms. Joy’s “fundamental constitutional right of freedom of religion” had been violated. ”She is entitled to have an identity card in which the word Islam does not appear,” Mr. Malanjum said, calling the agency’s refusal to officially change her religion “an abuse of power.” Outside the courthouse, located in the heart of Malaysia’s gleaming administrative capital, jubilant members of an Islamic youth organization cheered the decision, shouting “Allah Akbar,” meaning “God is great.” “We praise Allah for the position taken by the courts,” said Yusri Mohamad, the president of the Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia. “We welcome and applaud the decision.” But representatives of other religious communities said they were dismayed. “Something needs to be done,” said Leonard Teoh Hooi Leong, a lawyer representing the Malaysia Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism. “People like Lina Joy should not be trapped in a legal cage.” In practice, Mr. Teoh said, Ms. Joy, who was born Azlina Jailani, will have a very difficult time getting the Islamic authorities to allow her to leave Islam. No one in recent years has done it in the federal territory of Kuala Lumpur, where Ms. Joy is registered, he said. Those who have tried have been “threatened and cajoled,” Mr. Teoh said. Ms. Joy’s case reflects the larger debate across the globe about the place of traditional Islamic beliefs in modern, multicultural democracies and highlights differences of opinion on the age-old question of the separation of religion and state. ”Islam in our country is not just a religion — it’s law,” said Pawancheek Marican, a Malaysian lawyer who attended the trial. The specific Malaysian subtext of today’s decision is the system of legal and political segregation between Muslims and non-Muslims here that does not exist to the same extent in other multicultural countries with Muslim populations such as India or Indonesia. Muslims in Malaysia are the main political power-brokers and the beneficiaries of a three-decade-old program of privileges for “bumiputra” — Malays and other indigenous people — who make up about 65 percent of the population and are mostly Muslims. Large companies must respect hiring quotas for bumiputra as well as ownership rules that require certain levels of indigenous ownership. But continued Malay political power is predicated on this thin majority of bumiputra, so the prospect of people like Lina Joy leaving Islam is disconcerting to the government. These economic and political stakes add tension to the religious debate, with non-Muslims — mainly ethnic Chinese and Indians — resentful of the bumiputra’s privileges and power. ”For a long time I’ve noticed there has been an increase in Islamicization and discrimination,” Mr. Dawson, Ms. Joy’s lawyer, said in an interview last year. Mr. Dawson, a Christian of mixed Chinese and Indian heritage and whose practice focuses mainly on commercial law, said he took up Ms. Joy’s case in 1999 as a sort of religious mission. “It was a calling, if you understand it from the Christian perspective,” he said. He described Ms. Joy as “a simple and ordinary person” who felt strongly about her religious beliefs.

"The Iraqi government has undertaken urgent measures to determine the facts and locate the kidnappers. It is in contact with the British authorities over any developments," the government said in a statement. A special military unit has been set up to help hunt for the Britons -- a computer expert and his four bodyguards who were snatched on Tuesday from inside a Finance Ministry building by dozens of gunmen wearing police uniforms. "The government condemns this crime and is doing all it can to ensure the immediate release of the kidnapped Britons," the statement said. A senior Finance Ministry official said the building's guards were being questioned over the raid, in which no shots were fired. Investigators will be trying to establish how the gunmen knew the Britons were in the building. One of the guards said he had been briefly detained for questioning and then released. He said other colleagues were still being held. The guard, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters the gunmen had been led by a man in a police major's uniform who spoke to the hostages in fluent English. He said he did not recognise the gunmen's weapons but they were not AK-47s, the standard-issue weapon for Iraq's security forces. Iraq's foreign minister, Hoshiyar Zebari, said on Wednesday he suspected that the Mehdi Army militia of anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr was behind the kidnapping because the ministry was close to their stronghold of Sadr City. Iraq's police are known to be heavily infiltrated by Shi'ite militias and have often been accused of carrying out kidnappings and killings. Dozens of people were seized from the Higher Education Ministry by gunmen in police uniform last year. A government official said the abductions could be in retaliation for the killing of the militia's commander in the southern city of Basra by British-backed Iraqi soldiers. Sadr has made no public comment on the abductions, but aides say the operation was beyond the capability of the Mehdi Army. U.S. and Iraqi forces have staged raids in Sadr City in their hunt for the Britons, using armoured vehicles to smash down walls of houses. The unusually heavy-handed tactics indicate the soldiers are racing to find them before they are moved, possibly out of the capital. Police said two people, a man and his son, were killed in an air strike overnight on their home in Sadr City. It was not clear if it was linked to the search for the Britons. The U.S. military said it was checking the report. In a separate statement the military said it had staged a raid in Sadr City on Thursday and detained two suspected members of a "secret cell terrorist network" responsible for bringing roadside bombs into Iraq from Iran.

'Between eight and 10 Fatah al-Islam elements were killed yesterday (Wednesday) when the army responded with direct hits to fire which was targeting its positions,' a spokesman said. Officials from the Islamist group, which has been besieged by the army at the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp since its fighters launched attacks on military targets on May 20, could not be reached for confirmation. In all, 79 people have died in the fighting, according to an Agence France-Presse count before the latest army report of casualties among the militia's ranks. He said the situation at the camp remained relatively calm today but warned: 'The situation around Nahr al-Bared is very unstable, as the extremists keep firing on the army, which responds very forcefully.' The Beirut government, pushing for a peaceful end to the standoff, has insisted the group hand over fighters to stand trial over attacks against its armed forces during the bloodiest internal fighting since the 1975-1990 civil war. But Fatah al-Islam is adamant that none of its fighters will be surrendered. 'The situation is still complicated and requires more discussions in order to close the gap between the points of views of the two sides,' Sheikh Mohamad Al-Hajj, a member of a delegation of clerics attempting to mediate for a peaceful solution, told AFP. More than two thirds of Nahr al-Bared's 31,000 residents have been displaced by the fighting, as relief agencies struggle to deliver aid to the displaced and to residents still trapped inside.

Officials say the bomber walked up to a group of people waiting in a line at the recruitment center and detonated his explosives. The U.S. military gave a lower death toll, saying that one Iraqi policeman was killed and eight people were wounded in the blast.

Thursday, May 31, 2007 - ?2005 IranMania.com LONDON, May 31 (IranMania) - Iran's top nuclear negotiator emphasized again upon arrival in Spain there is no place of A-bombs in Tehran's security doctrine, and Iran is ready to give guarantees to engaged sides in that respect, IRNA reported. Ali Larijani added here on Wednesday night, "Our viewpoint in this respect is quite clear to understand: when we say that there is no room for atomic bombs in our defensive doctrine, we truly mean it, stand up to it, and are ready to give strong guarantees that we would not move toward acquiring weapons." Secretary of Supreme National Security Council added, "Our behavior in the past, too, is best proof for this claim, since a country that is after acquiring the nuclear weapons would never sign the nuclear NPT." He reiterated, "It is highly unlikely that a country, which is under the cameras of the International Atomic Energy Agency, would manage to manufacture atomic bombs." Larijani said, "Neither our policy, nor our behavior indicate that we are after such objectives, and yet, we have proposed measures that can assure the other side that we are not going towards producing weapons." Iran's top nuclear negotiator reiterated, "The two sides' comprehensive negotiations can begin tomorrow, and these very same questions that you reporters ask today can be discussed there." In response to a question whether the nuclear issue, too, was brought up during the current week Iran-US talks in Baghdad, he said, "The nuclear issue and Iraq are two separate issues and our negotiation there with the Americans was merely on Iraq security." Larijani added, "What made us talk to the Americans was the serious ongoing crisis in our neighborhood, that is the result of Iraq's occupation over the past four years." He reiterated, "The management of the occupiers has led to the prevalence of insecurity and countless economic problems in Iraq." The SNSC Secretary said, "In response to US Administration' request, and repeated Iraqi Government requests, it was agreed that potential would be employed at the service of improving security in Iraq in a bid to improve the Iraqi nation's living conditions." Larijani said that meeting with the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who would be visiting Madrid officially this Friday is not in his agenda. Larijani is scheduled to begin negotiations with EU Foreign Policy Chief Javier Solana in Madrid on Thursday evening, simultaneously with the arrival of the French President Nicholas Sarkozy's arrival in the Spanish capital, and a day before Condoleezza Rice's arrival there.

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18945566/site/newsweek/&cid Hirsh: Icy G8 Meeting for U.S., Russia - Newsweek Michael Hirsh - MSNBC.com Letters & Live Talks Compared to a decade or so ago, the belief in the messianic power of democracy and markets has reached a new low. Why another face-off between Washington and Moscow isnâ€™t as impossible as you might think. By By Michael Hirsh May 30, 2007 - It wasnâ€™t like Harry and â€œUncle Joeâ€ at all. Or was it? Sixty-two years ago, here at Potsdam, Harry Truman and Joe Stalin seemed to get along famously, putting on a display of bonhomie that belied how fast their relationship was about to go into a deep freeze. During the conference after the surrender of Nazi Germany, the U.S. president quietly received a message that said, â€œBabies satisfactorily born,â€ meaning the worldâ€™s first successful atomic test had just occurred at Los Alamos, N.M. The cold warâ€”and the start of a four-decadelong arms raceâ€”was just a year or so away. On Wednesday, representatives of the major powers met again in the Berlin suburb of Potsdam, this time for a G8 meeting. Such gatherings are typically relentlessly amiable, and so the delegates tried to make it this time. But beneath the forced grins, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov exchanged icy, even scary, words that suggested a new cold war is not inconceivable. â€œThe arms race is starting again,â€ Lavrov said flatly. The immediate issue was a missile-defense shield that Washington is trying to set up in Poland and the Czech Republic. Rice, in remarks the day before on her plane, had dismissed Russian concerns that the shield was aimed at Moscow as â€œludicrous.â€ The United States only intended to guard against nukes from smaller countries like North Korea and Iran, she said. But Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is still steamed over George W. Bush's unilateral withdrawal from the antiballistic-missile treaty, warned Washington against turning Europe into a â€œpowder kegâ€ and promptly fired off a new test ICBM. His deputy prime minister and putative successor, Sergei Ivanov, boasted that Russia â€œhas new tactical and strategic complexes that are capable of overcoming any existing or future missile-defense systems." Asked about Riceâ€™s comments at Potsdam, Foreign Minister Lavrov was cuttingâ€”and uncompromising. â€œThere is nothing ludicrous aboutâ€ Russiaâ€™s concerns, he snapped. The U.S. secretary of State, seeking desperately to keep the atmosphere light-hearted, tried a mild joke (to the extent that mass destruction can be funny). â€œI would note that President Putin said yesterday that Russia would ... destroy any shield,â€ she said. â€œWe quite agree.â€ There were a few chuckles in the room. But the laughing ended when Lavrov said: â€œI hope that nobody has to actually prove that Condiâ€™s right about that.â€ This is rough language indeed for a meeting thatâ€™s supposed to represent the calm â€œworld of â€˜post-historyâ€™,â€ where great nations rise above such petty threats and make war no more. The atmosphere between Washington and Moscow has grown so tenseâ€”not only over this, but over Putinâ€™s bullying on energy supplies, over continuing aggressive U.S. moves to bring former Soviet satellites and states into NATO, and over smaller issues like independence for Kosovoâ€”that Bush resorted to the only card he has left, his still-cordial personal relationship with the Russian president. The White House abruptly announced Wednesday that the president was inviting Putin to the Bush family home in Kennebunkport, Maine, for two days in July. As if sensing that things had spiraled out of control in Potsdam, Rice interrupted the end of the news conference Wednesday to deliver what an aide described an impromptu confirmation of the visit. In Maine, Lavrov added humorlessly, â€œAll sorts of areas where our positions do not coincide will be discussed.â€ Get alerted to the latest from Newsweek's columnists through your MSN or Windows Messenger, your e-mail or your mobile device.

Kate and Gerry McCann both shed tears at times during the general audience in St Peter&rsquo;s Square at the Vatican. But afterwards they insisted it had been a positive experience and provided great strength as they continued the hunt for their missing daughter. Four-year-old Madeleine was snatched four weeks ago today from the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz. Yesterday her parents sat just 20 yards away from the Holy Father during the religious ceremony before speaking to him for a little less than 30 seconds. He prayed with both of them, while Mr McCann bowed and kissed his hand. Looking solemnly at the couple, he leant forward to bless a photograph of Madeleine. Mr McCann said afterwards: &ldquo;It was more personal than I could ever imagine it could have been. There was recognition immediately, looking at Madeleine&rsquo;s photograph. His touch, words and thoughts were more tender than we could have thought.&rdquo; His wife added: &ldquo;It was very emotional but it was a very positive experience really, it has been very helpful to us. He was very kind, he said he would pray for us and our family and continue to have faith for us.&rdquo; The couple said they had mixed emotions about being at the Vatican because it was tinged with sadness that Madeleine is still missing. Mr McCann said: &ldquo;In other circumstances of course it would be the highlight for any Catholic to meet the Pope. &ldquo;It is tainted with the very marked realisation that our daughter is still missing.&rdquo; Mr McCann said the most difficult aspect of Madeleine&rsquo;s abduction was not knowing where she is. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still in the middle of a race and we do not know how long it is going to be. I do not know how we will have changed but I think it is fair to say we will never be the same again.&rdquo; At one point in yesterday&rsquo;s ceremony, an English-speaking priest issued a prayer on behalf of the Pope to the 35,000-strong crowd, saying: &ldquo;In a special way his blessing goes to your children and your loved ones.&rdquo; His words proved too much for the British couple from Rothley in Leicestershire who struggled to compose themselves, wiping back the tears with their heads bowed. For much of the audience Mrs McCann, with the now standard green and yellow ribbons in her hair fluttering in the breeze, kept her eyes closed. Her husband offered continuous support, slipping his arm round her waist and squeezing her shoulder. But he too at times succumbed to tears. Despite their struggle during the event, Mrs McCann seemed stronger and more composed as she spoke at a packed press conference afterwards. Describing what she said to the Holy Father, she said: &ldquo;I thanked him first of all for letting us meet him and I thanked him for his prayers. &ldquo;It has been a very positive experience and it has helped us &ndash; it can only make us stronger and lifted us up more.&rdquo; for irishexaminer.com stories before this date Anti-poverty group urges action by next government 'Character' Bellamy to skipper Wales Search on for passengers who sat near TB man Paris up at closing Halo 2 out on June 8 Let Darina Allen and co tickle your palate We'll help you make &copy Examiner Publications (Cork) Limited, City Quarter, Lapps Quay, Cork.

The views expressed are the author's alone. BEIRUT, 31 May 2007 (IRIN) - With no immediate end in sight to the stand-off between the army and Islamist militants in Nahr al-Bared refugee camp in northern Lebanon, and with neighbouring Beddawi camp already full to bursting, aid agencies have delivered relief to several hundred families displaced further to the east and south of the country. According to figures from the UN Palestinian relief organisation UNRWA, some 309 families, or about 1,500 people, have fled Nahr al-Bared for the camps of Borj Barajneh, Shatila and Mar Elias, located in and around Beirut. Sixty-one families have fled the north for the eastern Bekaa valley, staying with host families in villages or in the Wavel camp, while in the south 90 displaced families are being hosted by relatives in Rashadiyeh and Al-Buss camps in and around Tyre. A further 120 families have found shelter in Sidon city or Ein al-Helwe camp. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has delivered food and hygiene kits to scores of displaced Palestinian families in and around various refugee camps across the south and east of Lebanon over the past few days. On 31 May it distributed a further 20,000 litres of water and 800 hygiene kits into Nahr al-Bared camp, through its partners in the Palestinian Popular Committee. Sultan Abul Aynan, overall commander in Lebanon of the secular and dominant Palestinian faction Fatah, told IRIN that all of Lebanon's 12 refugee camps - home to just over half the country's 400,000 Palestinians - remained on a high security alert, but played down the prospects of further security breakdowns. Under a 1969 Arab agreement, the Lebanese army may surround but does not enter any of the camps, leaving security inside to the Palestinians. "The situation in the camps is under control and the Lebanese army is allowing us to get our necessary supplies," Abul Aynan said. UNRWA is now taking the lead on delivering aid to the estimated 20,000 people displaced to Beddawi camp, 10km from Nahr al-Bared, and to those who fled further south. Water and electricity services at Beddawi camp, which is just two kilometres square and whose original population numbered about 16,000, are struggling under the strain of the huge influx. The agency's single clinic in Beddawi camp is now running 12 hours a day in an effort to meet the huge extra demands. UNRWA said it is looking into the possibility of erecting prefabricated temporary accommodation on the edge of the camp and installing mobile generators, portable showers, toilets and water tanks. Some Palestinians quoted in local media reports, however, rejected the proposal, fearing it could encourage the full-scale destruction of Nahr al-Bared camp and decrease their chances of returning home. "The needs in Beddawi are still very great," said Hoda al-Turk, spokeswoman for UNRWA in Lebanon. "The food situation is alright but we still face a lack of clothes and hygiene kits."

But, seriously, I don't see why this is such a horrible protest. Just because the meat is from a dog some people think is cute doesn't make it worse than eating, say, deer. Deer are cute, too. The sport of fox hunting is an elitist activity by people who live off the labor of other people. People should protest it - as well as the monarchy. A vegetarian forcing her/himself to consume meat is a serious sacrifice, so it's heartfelt. Bottomline: It got everyone's attention. And that is, afterall, what protest is supposed to do.

May 20 was the anniversary of the formation of Iraq's first fully elected and constitutional government, led by Nouri al-Maliki. Today, the Maliki government is virtually nonexistent, and Iraq is in chaos. June 5-6 will be the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of the 1967 Six-Day War. That was a conflict precipitated by Egypt in which a victorious Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza. After decades of inconclusive peace talks, Israel still effectively controls these territories. An elected Palestinian Authority is on the verge of collapse, and near anarchy reigns in Gaza. Iraq and Gaza represent a frightening trend toward disintegration in the region, especially in places where elections have replaced Arab autocrats. On my trip to Israel, Jordan, Iraq and Syria, I plan to examine whether there's any way to enhance stability in the Middle East. I'm not very optimistic. In the wake of the Iraq war and the breakdown of any Israeli-Palestinian peace process, my Mideast contacts say the regional chaos will only get worse.I was in Baghdad last year when the Maliki government took office. It was clear that this was a government in name only. The constitutional system the U.S. helped set up creates a weak prime minister with little power. Congress and the White House can demand benchmarks, but Maliki can't deliver. Iraq shows the fallacy of White House dreams of social engineering. Many of the Middle East's authoritarian regimes -- like Egypt and Syria -- are fragile and dependent on the military and secret police to keep power. But knocking off a dictator, in states where no civic institutions have been allowed to grow, won't create a democratic nirvana -- especially when religious political parties are the strongest political forces, and best positioned to win the vote. I'm returning to Baghdad to see if there is the slightest chance Iraq's political leaders can come together to stop the sectarian killing. Are two states still possible? The tragic situation on the West Bank and in Gaza also reflects misunderstanding of the region. The death of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat offered the White House the last best chance to encourage a two-state solution. It passed up the chance. Arafat's successor, Mahmoud Abbas, and his Palestinian Authority were weak, but Abbas was committed to two states, side by side. Had Gaza been returned to him via peace talks, his Fatah party would have been strengthened -- and Hamas undermined. Instead, the U.S. backed Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to withdraw unilaterally from Gaza. This bolstered Hamas' argument that their violent tactics drove out the Israelis. The undercutting of Abbas led to the predictable disintegration of the Palestinian Authority. Even as President Bush was telling Americans that Gaza would morph into a model democracy, its impoverished society was collapsing. Its people, desperate for services, voted for Hamas. A trip to Israel on the 40th anniversary of the Six-Day War must focus on the future of the West Bank and Gaza. I want to hear whether Israelis and Palestinian have any new ideas about how to create two states -- or whether this concept is no longer valid. The answer is crucial for the entire Middle East and for U.S. interests in the region. If the two-state solution is dead, Palestinian society will fragment further under Israeli control. That, in turn, would inspire Palestinian Islamists to strike out with greater ferocity at Israel and beyond. It is this fragmentation that creates breeding grounds for small and violent Islamist groups -- the most frightening trend in the region. Such groups are far more difficult to deal with than rulers of states. When Israel fought the Six-Day War, it fought regimes with recognized leaders with whom it could negotiate a truce or a peace. I am heading for a region where splinter groups -- in Iraq, in Lebanon, in Gaza -- can hold off armies and have no desire to negotiate. The most urgent question in today's Middle East is how to counter that trend -- and whether diplomacy can succeed where military might cannot.

From left, Skye Bortoli and Ayesha Future are in Anchorage campaigning to save whales. IN THE winter of 2004, a humpback whale slid below the swell at Byron Bay in northern New South Wales, just as a camera shutter clicked. Humpback tails are as individual as faces or fingerprints, and this tail was particularly elegant. Wide, symmetrical and creamy white, it was unmarked by the frequent scars of battle and survival. A thin, dark line traced the tail's trailing edge, which swept out to finely balanced fluke tips. At a notch midway between the tips were two small dots - flaws in the perfection. Photo identification is a widely used tool to discover more about the lives of humpbacks, and the Australian researchers kept this picture in a catalogue. Recently it was matched with two other images: one at Hervey Bay in Queensland 14 months later and another shot by a New Zealander at the Balleny Islands, in Antarctica, in February last year. The same whale is unmistakable in each image, even to a layman. The subtle confirmation is those two dots. The images of this whale were recorded in a scientific paper and put before the International Whaling Commission. They confirm a legend, tell of the real link Australians are building with these animals, and point to conflict ahead. The legend was that the Ballenys forsaken, isolated rock outcrops on the edge of the Ross Sea were a reliable waypoint for humpbacks on the annual migration to and from Antarctica. Here was solid evidence. The link came through years of collecting tail fluke ID photographs, and months of skilled analysis to match the images - sifting needles from the pictorial haystack. In those collections, two other tails were found at the Ballenys, about 5000 kilometres from their Australian haunts. This is a reminder that among an estimated 7000 east Australian humpbacks and perhaps 14,000 that call the west coast home, as many as one in five has been photographed, and so is a known individual. And that points to the conflict. This week at the IWC gathering in Anchorage, Alaska, Australia and other anti-whaling nations are trying to persuade Japan not to harpoon these humpbacks next summer. If they fail, the odds are that in places where the whalers normally hunt - such as the Ballenys - about 10 of the Japanese haul of 50 will be these known individuals. Aside from their deaths by harpoon, they will be points of scientific light extinguished, no longer illuminating the little that is known about their travels. And by some Australians they will also be mourned. A 14-year-old Aboriginal girl from Port Stephens, NSW, carried wisdom far beyond her years to the IWC meeting this week. She was there to plead, with her friends, for the humpbacks. "These are our humpbacks," said Skye Bortoli. "The first thing they see when they come from their mother's womb is the Australian coastline. So if anyone should determine what happens to them, it's us." But the fate of these humpback whales depends on international manoeuvrings, public policy and direct intervention. At the IWC, there is Japan's drive to resume commercial whaling, and the future of the organisation itself. An electoral contest is also developing between Labor and the Coalition over whaling that may spur greater action. And if all of these developments fail to halt the harpoons, there are the protest ships. Sea Shepherd found and attacked the Japanese fleet last summer - at the Ballenys. Humpbacks first appeared on the Japanese list when it unveiled an increased "research" plan in 2005. It trialled the plan over the next two years with fin whales, partly to determine whether it could handle whales larger than minkes on the factory ship Nisshin Maru. From next summer it would mean killing up to 935 minkes, 50 fin whales, which are second only to the blue in size, and 50 humpbacks. Japan maintains that it is trying to determine whether there has been a shift in the population balance. It claims the fully protected humpbacks, and also fin whales, are now out-competing minkes. Despite the apparent conflict with this theory, it also doubled its minke kill. This week - even though it lost weeks of "research" to a fatal ship fire, and only took three of 10 planned fins (the largest was a pregnant female weighing a hefty 65 tonnes) - Japanese officials formally concluded that the feasibility study worked. The Nisshin Maru has been repaired and will go ahead with the full program, whaling across a vast stretch of ocean far south of Australia. It has been a growing and multi-pronged campaign on the part of Japan. In "diplomatic" terms, it reached its zenith at the 2006 IWC meeting. The pro-whaling side won a non-binding vote that declared the moratorium on commercial whaling was no longer necessary. Anti-whaling nations, however, responded to the shock outcome by recruiting their own new members this year, welcoming aboard Greece, Slovenia, Ecuador, Cyprus and Croatia. This week more than 70 nations came to the meeting in Anchorage. Even before the delegates arrived, there were signs that the IWC's strange international vote race may be ending. Each side held its own think tank earlier this year on how to reform the organisation. They independently agreed on some things, such as the need to reduce the level of insults and confrontation in its meetings. The usually strident Japanese delegation withdrew some of its normal demands and its leader, Joji Morishita, surprised reporters by declaring: "Actually, I'm not interested in the numbers game any more." The issue that had threatened to blow up for the US hosts, a quota of bowhead whales for Alaskan Eskimos, was defused with Japan before the meeting began. Instead, the two early pressure points have been the Southern Ocean humpback hunt, and a long-standing Japanese bid to gain a minke whale quota for its small, remnant coastal whaling industry. Morishita, the cool, greying face of Japanese whaling diplomacy, made it clear that this coastal minke catch was important to his whaling industry. "Japan believes the fate of this proposal will test whether the IWC can be revived as a responsible international organisation." If the addition of humpbacks to its scientific research was Japan's bargaining chip to allow the coastal catch, it failed. Anti-whaling nations said as a group that this was commercial whaling, not the indigenous subsistence hunt that it was claimed to be. And there would be no whale-trading. Patrick Ramage, from the International Fund for Animal Welfare, called Japan's proposal a bad joke. "It's the equivalent of a robber coming in to your house and saying 'you know what? I'm going to take a few less of your family heirlooms this year. Why don't you do something in return.' " Australian Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull ruled out support of anything but the indigenous subsistence hunt. Instead, with the New Zealand Conservation Minister, Chris Carter, he turned up the heat on Japan. The two ministers asked it to call off the humpback hunt as a gesture of goodwill. Turnbull said the humpbacks should be seen as part of the life of Australia's coastal communities. "What we have been saying privately and publicly to our friends in Japan is that the inclusion of the humpbacks is a highly provocative act," he said. "It is calculated to undermine dramatically the standing, the affection, the relationship between Australia and the Japanese people." In the face of these public warnings, Morishita kept open his offer of talks on the issue, which Australia and New Zealand took up. The first round left Turnbull sounding gloomy. "No one has changed the Japanese mind here for what, 20 years? So you'd have to be quite an optimist to believe that you could change their mind in the course of 24 hours." But as the meeting rolled on, Japan softened its demand for the coastal hunt, raising hope among conservationists. "I think we may soon have a deal," Ramage said. Turnbull stayed bullish: "The Japanese are really trying to use the humpbacks as hostages. Let's be honest. In effect, we are seeing a return to the pre-IWC days of unilateral whaling." But he insisted he was also willing to talk. If the humpback hunt is not dropped by Japan, it threatens to become an obstacle for the Howard Government at the federal election. As green issues go, climate and water far outrank whaling today. But Australians still love their whales. An independent Galaxy opinion poll for the conservation group Australians for Animals recently found that only 11 per cent of Australians believed the Howard Government was doing enough to protect humpbacks, and 81 per cent wanted it to do more. The poll found that 77 per cent of Australians approved of the ALP policy to take Japan to international courts. Within a week of this finding, Labor upped the ante. Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd released a policy declaring illegal the killing of whales by Japan in waters claimed as an Australian Whale Sanctuary off the Australian Antarctic Territory. Controversially, it also said that Labor would enforce Australian law prohibiting whaling in these waters, monitor whalers operating there, and maintain the option of boarding their ships. The use of the navy was an option, and evidence gathered could be used in an international court case. Japan repeatedly refused to comment on the Labor policy, though Turnbull quickly attacked it as suggesting high-seas piracy. However the idea of putting extra heat on Japan in the Antarctic resonated in some government seats with whale-watching interests. The parliamentary secretary for industry, Bob Baldwin, said it would be a good use of taxpayers' money to give the new Antarctic air link the task of detecting whaling ships in order to name and shame them. Meanwhile, the perils of human control over humpback whales are being driven home at the IWC. The Caribbean island of St Vincent was given the right to catch up to four a year in a hotly opposed indigenous hunt. The history of this hunt is younger than the 1851 novel Moby Dick. The inadequate weapons used mean protracted deaths for the humpbacks, usually female. And the whale is consumed in a beachside barbecue, complete with plentiful liquor stalls and gawping tourists. In an effort to find some harmony in the IWC, Australia joined in approving St Vincent's new quota. The consensus was greeted with applause. The International Whaling Commission was set up in 1946 to "manage the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry". It failed at the task as whale stocks were devastated in the mid-20th century, leading to the moratorium on commercial whaling that came into force in 1986. The only permitted whaling quotas are for aboriginal subsistence whaling. About 360 whales were hunted under that category in the past year. Japan, however, has used the IWC's "scientific research" loophole to license its own whaling. It kills about 1000 whales a year - mainly minkes. Controversially, this year, it has added 50 humpbacks to its list. Yesterday, the IWC passed a resolution condemning Japan's scientific slaughter of whales and calling for its end. But the only way to close the loophole is to have every nation agree to change the IWC's founding convention. There are now 77 member nations in the IWC, broadly split into pro and anti-whaling camps. A handful of countries are neutral. Australia is among the anti-whaling group. In the year since the last meeting, a total of 1616 whales were reported hunted and killed to the IWC. Andrew Darby is The Age's Hobart correspondent.

May. 30 2007 8:00 AM ET The parents of four-year-old Madeleine McCann, who disappeared during a family vacation in Portugal on May 3, visited the Vatican today and met with Pope Benedict XVI. Kate and Gerry McCann, both devout Catholics, shook hands with the Pope as he made his way through a large crowd at the end of his general audience in St. Peter's Square. Then they handed the Pontiff a picture of their daughter. "The Pope put his hand on the photo, he blessed the photo and then spoke to the parents for a few minutes," Vatican Affairs Correspondent Gerry O'Connell told CTV Newsnet Wednesday. Kate, carrying a pink, fluffy toy cat belonging to her missing daughter, appeared to be holding back tears during the brief encounter. Madeleine's father kissed the Pope's hands. "You could see from their faces they were really torn with sorrow, they were appealing to the Pope," O'Connell said from Rome. Before the encounter, Madeleine's parents said they hoped to draw strength from their meeting as well as to help keep the campaign to find their daughter in the media spotlight. "We have mixed emotions about being here," Madeleine's father, Gerry, told reporters as he and his wife arrived to attend the Pope's general audience. "Under normal circumstances it would be one of the most exciting things we could do in our own lifetime, but very much on our minds is the fact that we're here without Madeleine." Madeleine vanished after her parents left her, and her brother and sister -- both aged 2 -- alone while they went to a nearby restaurant within their hotel complex in the Algarve. British media have reported $2.6 million pounds (Cdn$6.1 million dollars) has been contributed to a reward fund from citizens and celebrities such as J.K. Rowling and Sir Richard Branson. The McCanns said they would not return to the U.K. until their daughter was found. They are set to return to southern Portugal later Wednesday and are also planning trips to Madrid on Friday and Berlin on June 4.

http://www.smh.com.au/news/editorial/let-the-balibo-cards-fall-where-they-may/2007/05/31/1180205422168.html&cid Let the Balibo cards fall where they may - Editorial - Opinion - smh.com.au Welcome to The Sydney Morning Herald. Let the Balibo cards fall where they may THE commander of an Indonesian special forces unit accused of murdering five Australia-based journalists in East Timor in 1975 has more lately styled himself as a champion of free speech. Mohammed Yunus Yosfiah was a captain when Indonesian forces overran Balibo in October 1975 and, according to evidence before an inquest into the deaths of the five men, was first to fire on at least three of the journalists as they tried to surrender. Under the former Indonesian strongman Soeharto, Yosfiah rose to the rank of lieutenant-general, but as Soeharto's authoritarian regime crumbled in 1998 Yosfiah quickly re-invented himself as a political reformist. As the first post-Soeharto information minister it was Yosfiah who abolished decades of censorship, media licensing restrictions and harassment of the press in one fell swoop. This recent history is worth recalling in assessing the latest howls of protest from the Indonesian Government and a couple of hundred angry protesters in Jakarta. Democracy in Indonesia is now almost a decade old. For Jakarta to profess such profound offence over the request for an Indonesian official to testify at the inquest during a recent visit to Sydney - and to continue to insist the Balibo case is closed - is an unfortunate flashback to the darker days of the Soeharto era. The proper legal process unfolding in Sydney is nothing more than the long overdue airing of a tragic truth. Whatever predictable diplomatic row now ensues, the core issue is this: respect for judicial processes and freedom of information in a democracy is not selective - no matter how unpalatable the truth or how prominent the officials involved. Certainly, the evidence before the coronial inquest in Sydney tells a grim story. It wholeheartedly damns the Indonesian military and the Soeharto government, but it also does Australia's politicians and policy makers of the era no credit. At the centre is Yosfiah, identifiable from evidence before the coroner as one of two individuals who the counsel assisting the coroner believes could be successfully prosecuted for war crimes under the Geneva Conventions - although as a mere captain at the time he was almost certain to have been acting on orders. Yosfiah has always denied any involvement, and the Indonesian government has consistently claimed the men died in crossfire - a position earlier Australian inquiries have endorsed despite intelligence reports to the contrary. Yosfiah and a second man, Christoforus da Silva, are highly unlikely to ever face an Australian court, because this would require Jakarta's co-operation in extradition. This reality does not undermine the value of the inquest. As truth commissions in nations such as South Africa and El Salvador have shown, the mere process of airing the truth is immensely important for surviving family members and in establishing credible historical records. In East Timor, where the 24-year Indonesian military occupation cost some 200,000 lives, only a handful of local Timorese have been jailed for their part in decades of terrible human rights abuses. And Dili has pragmatically chosen not to pursue senior Indonesian officials. Australia, however, has no such need to kowtow to a sensitive Jakarta over such a clear violation. When Indonesia launched its full-scale invasion in December 1975, seven weeks after the Balibo raid, a plaintive cry was picked up by radio in Darwin: "They are trying to take over all Timor &#133; Indonesians &#133; SOS, please help us." But Australia was well aware of the illegal invasion plan and willing to turn a blind eye, over decades, to avoid offending the powerful Soeharto regime. It was also argued in 1975 that Australia had reasonably feared instability in the former Portuguese colony off its northern coastline and so preferred East Timor's incorporation into the Indonesian state. Realpolitik leads governments to make many difficult choices, but Australia's stance on East Timor arguably weighed the interests of the state too heavily against fundamental values of human rights and international law. The former prime minister Gough Whitlam referred to the five journalists as "foolhardy" and criticised them for not heeding warnings to leave East Timor. Journalists should not expect special privileges in a war zone but, like civilians, they must not be deliberately targeted. The revelation at the inquest that "nearly everybody in a position to know" in Canberra believed the five men had been deliberately killed - while the government peddled the crossfire line - discredits a succession of Australian officials. In retrospect, Australia's complicity in the occupation probably exacerbated bilateral tensions, rather than smoothed them, because of the endless protests it provoked in Australia. After more than three decades, and much cynical obfuscation on both sides of the Timor Sea, a credible, if deeply disturbing, picture is finally emerging of how the Channel Seven reporter Greg Shackleton, 27, cameraman Gary Cunningham, 27, and sound recordist Tony Stewart, 21, and Nine cameraman Brian Peters, 29, and reporter Malcolm Rennie, 28, died. Whether the visiting Governor of Jakarta, Sutiyoso, who was a special forces officer at Balibo, should have been approached in his hotel this week is a side issue. Indonesia is a democracy. Indonesia's press is free to criticise Australia, and it does so with vigour. Indonesian courts are free to prosecute Australians within their jurisdiction, and they do. Mr Sutiyoso is an aspiring presidential candidate who well understands the demands of democratic openness. He is perfectly entitled to feel "deeply humiliated". However, if any apology is due it is only because the police may have let themselves into his hotel room using a master key.

Mr Abhisit yesterday called on the Council for National Security junta to lift its embargo on public political activities and to allow members of the banned Thai Rak Thai party to form new groups. "We encourage the regime to open up a political space, to remove restrictions on the formation of new parties, to allow supporters of Thai Rak Thai to regroup and use the parliamentary system," said Mr Abhisit. "The country needs at this moment stability by setting a clear road map for democracy," he told the CNBC satellite news service. "Even the military must now feel the pressure. The experience of the last six to seven months has proved there is no other alternative to democracy to restore stability and solve (our) economic problems." CNS chief General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, who overthrew Thaksin Shinawatra's Thai Rak Thai government on September 19, said he would consult military-appointed prime minister General Surayud Chulanont about lifting the political activities ban within a fortnight. The generals have offered a tentative timetable for a popular vote on a new draft constitution in September and national elections, though under sharply different conditions from the 1997 constitution, by mid-December. The junta had been awaiting Wednesday night's Constitutional Tribunal verdicts before taking further steps towards the promised restoration of a democratic government. The tribunal's decisions to sustain allegations of electoral abuses against Thai Rak Thai during the abortive April 2006 election campaign but to exonerate the Democrats has left 50-year-old Mr Abhisit as Thailand's only likely next prime minister. As a result of Wednesday's rulings, described by one Bangkok pundit as "a political massacre", Mr Thaksin and 110 other Thai Rak Thai executives - the politicians who ran Thailand from early 2001 until the coup - have been banned from politics for the next five years. Chaturon Chaisaeng, Thai Rak Thai's acting leader while Mr Thaksin remains indefinitely based in London, said in a statement yesterday the party was looking at ways of challenging the banning orders. Mr Chaturon was apparently relying on reports that the tribunal's decision to convict Thai Rak Thai and exonerate the Democrats was not unanimous. However, the interim national constitution allows no appeal against a tribunal decision. At best, Thai Rak Thai supporters can hope to be allowed to register a new party in the same name as the dissolved group. Their only recourse appears to be a direct appeal to the interim government, which is filled with Mr Thaksin's opponents. However, the military and the interim government remain wary of provoking widespread civil disobedience among supporters of Mr Thaksin, who remains widely popular, especially among Thailand's poor rural dwellers. In its judgment on Wednesday night, the Constitution Tribunal acknowledged Thai Rak Thai's membership still numbered 14 million, in a total population of 61.5 million. The military and police maintained tight security in the capital yesterday, although by the evening none of the feared mass demonstrations by Thai Rak Thai supporters had eventuated. Mr Thaksin in London yesterday released a message urging his supporters to accept the tribunal ruling and calling on the junta to convene elections as soon as possible. "Although I announced that I would wash my hands out of politics, I would like to urge (party) members to work and implement political activities for the sake of the country and the people," he said in a letter read out in Bangkok by his lawyer, Noppadon Pattama. The 57-year-old former telecommunications tycoon, whose party in 2005 was the first in Thai electoral history to win an absolute majority of votes and seats, apologised to his supporters that their efforts had come to such an end.

At the end of his weekly Wednesday general audience, after giving his catechism and greeting the crowds in several languages, Pope Benedict XVI went up to the section reserved for special guests and greeted people lined up to see him. Kate and Gerry McCann, both Catholics, waited for their turn with particularly mixed emotions. "In normal circumstances it could be one of the most exciting things we could do in our own lifetime but the fact remains we are here without Madeleine," Gerry McCann told journalists in front of St. Peter's Basilica just before the audience. "This is a very nerve-racking experience." The Pope was shaking hands, smiling and waving as he made his way along but the mood changed dramatically when he was introduced by his secretary to the McCanns. Both dressed in dark suits (Kate McCann was wearing a rosary around her neck and a green ribbon in her hair) the couple stood apparently on the verge of tears as the Pope approached them and took their hands. Gerry McCann quickly kissed the Pope's ring and Kate McCann quietly listened to the Pope's words and almost in a whisper asked him if he would bless "a picture of Maddie." The Pontiff gently stroked the photo and made the sign of the cross. He then turned to Gerry McCann and squeezed his hands at length. Gerry McCann was holding Madeleine's favorite stuffed animal, her Cuddle cat. He seemed too upset to speak. At a news conference in Rome after the meeting, Kate McCann said the Pope "was very kind, very sincere," and said that he told them he would continue to pray for Madeleine's return. Gerry McCann was touched by how personal the Pope had been. "His touch and thoughts and words were more tender than we could have hoped, and that will sustain us during this most difficult time," he said.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/world/asia/30cnd-malaysia.html&cid Malaysian Court Refuses to Recognize Woman&#8217;s Conversion to Christianity - New York Times Malaysian Court Refuses to Recognize Woman’s Conversion to Christianity Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 30, 2007 , May 30 — In a controversial victory for Islamic law over secularism, Malaysia’s highest court today refused to recognize the conversion of a Muslim-born woman to Christianity, ruling that the matter was beyond the jurisdiction of the country’s civil courts and should be handled by religious authorities. Muslims, who make up about 60 percent of Malaysia’s population, have co-existed with Buddhists, Christians, Hindus and Sikhs for decades in this country, considered one of the world’s most progressive and modern Muslim democracies. But the ruling here underlined the increasing separateness of Muslims from people of other religions and reinforced the notion, widely held in many Muslim countries, that Islamic law should have primacy over secular laws in certain aspects of their lives. The Federal Court was divided 2-1 in its decision, with the only non-Muslim judge, Richard Malanjum, dissenting forcefully and arguing that the Constitution must remain the supreme law of the land. The split on the court mirrored the discord in Malaysian society, where ethnic and religious tensions have begun to increase in recent years. The ruling exhausted the last appeal of Lina Joy, who, after being baptized a Roman Catholic in May 1998, wanted to remove the word “Islam” from her identity card in order to marry her Catholic fiancé. Muslims in Malaysia are subject to separate laws on inheritance and marriage — they must marry within the faith — and are not allowed to have premarital relationships or drink alcohol, among other rules. Because separate laws apply to them, Muslims must list their religion on their identity cards. Ms. Joy, who lost her job as a saleswoman last year because of the controversy and whose family has reportedly been harassed, is seeking political asylum in Australia, according to one of her advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for her. Ms. Joy’s lawyer, Benjamin Dawson, was not available after the trial to comment on the verdict or the reported asylum application. Ms. Joy was not in the courtroom today. The Malaysian chief justice, Ahmad Fairuz Abdul Halim, who read out his majority opinion in the packed but respectfully hushed courtroom, said the government agency responsible for identity cards had acted reasonably when it refused to change Ms. Joy’s religious status. ”She cannot at her own whim simply enter or leave her religion,” Mr. Ahmad said. “She must follow rules.” The Malaysian Constitution is in some ways a self-contradicting document, analysts say. It both defends freedom of religion and declares Islam the official religion. The abandonment of Islam, or apostasy, is deplored by many Muslims and in some Malaysian states is punishable by fines and imprisonment. In order for Ms. Joy to officially change her religion, Mr. Ahmad said, she must offer proof from a special Muslim court that she has abandoned Islam. “The civil courts cannot interfere,” Mr. Ahmad said. Mr. Malanjum said in his dissenting opinion that Ms. Joy’s “fundamental constitutional right of freedom of religion” had been violated. ”She is entitled to have an identity card in which the word Islam does not appear,” Mr. Malanjum said, calling the agency’s refusal to officially change her religion “an abuse of power.” Outside the courthouse, located in the heart of Malaysia’s gleaming administrative capital, jubilant members of an Islamic youth organization cheered the decision, shouting “Allah Akbar,” meaning “God is great.” “We praise Allah for the position taken by the courts,” said Yusri Mohamad, the president of the Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia. “We welcome and applaud the decision.” But representatives of other religious communities said they were dismayed. “Something needs to be done,” said Leonard Teoh Hooi Leong, a lawyer representing the Malaysia Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism. “People like Lina Joy should not be trapped in a legal cage.” In practice, Mr. Teoh said, Ms. Joy, who was born Azlina Jailani, will have a very difficult time getting the Islamic authorities to allow her to leave Islam. No one in recent years has done it in the federal territory of Kuala Lumpur, where Ms. Joy is registered, he said. Those who have tried have been “threatened and cajoled,” Mr. Teoh said. Ms. Joy’s case reflects the larger debate across the globe about the place of traditional Islamic beliefs in modern, multicultural democracies and highlights differences of opinion on the age-old question of the separation of religion and state. ”Islam in our country is not just a religion — it’s law,” said Pawancheek Marican, a Malaysian lawyer who attended the trial. The specific Malaysian subtext of today’s decision is the system of legal and political segregation between Muslims and non-Muslims here that does not exist to the same extent in other multicultural countries with Muslim populations such as India or Indonesia. Muslims in Malaysia are the main political power-brokers and the beneficiaries of a three-decade-old program of privileges for “bumiputra” — Malays and other indigenous people — who make up about 65 percent of the population and are mostly Muslims. Large companies must respect hiring quotas for bumiputra as well as ownership rules that require certain levels of indigenous ownership. But continued Malay political power is predicated on this thin majority of bumiputra, so the prospect of people like Lina Joy leaving Islam is disconcerting to the government. These economic and political stakes add tension to the religious debate, with non-Muslims — mainly ethnic Chinese and Indians — resentful of the bumiputra’s privileges and power. ”For a long time I’ve noticed there has been an increase in Islamicization and discrimination,” Mr. Dawson, Ms. Joy’s lawyer, said in an interview last year. Mr. Dawson, a Christian of mixed Chinese and Indian heritage and whose practice focuses mainly on commercial law, said he took up Ms. Joy’s case in 1999 as a sort of religious mission. “It was a calling, if you understand it from the Christian perspective,” he said. He described Ms. Joy as “a simple and ordinary person” who felt strongly about her religious beliefs. More Articles in International &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Protesters denouncing Thailand's junta braved a security clampdown in Bangkok after a ruling barring the ousted prime minister and his party from elections cast uncertainty on the country's political future. Protesters denouncing Thailand's junta braved a security clampdown here Thursday after a ruling barring the ousted prime minister and his party from elections cast uncertainty on the country's political future. About 1,000 people wearing yellow headbands and chanting "Junta -- get out!" gathered at a central Bangkok intersection hemmed in by hundreds of police who refused to let the demonstration move. "We are not allowing them to hold rally," said Colonel Supisarn Bhakdinarinach, metropolitan police spokesman. The turnout was smaller than that expected by the authorities, who earlier said they were expecting thousands of Thai Rak Thai (TRT) members to join a rally by a group supporting ex-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Army chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin told AFP said an indefinite crackdown had been imposed with extra checkpoints and other security measures, and with Thaksin's "hardcore" allies under close watch. "Security measures have been stepped up since last night and will gradually be increased. The measures will be in place for a long time," said the general, who led the coup against Thaksin in September. Thaksin, now living in London, apologised to his party over the court ruling handed down late Wednesday. "I, as founder and leader of the party ... apologise to all party members, executives and supporters who have met with this unexpected fate," he wrote in a letter handed out to media. Thaksin's party was found guilty of fraud in April 2006 elections, which were later annulled amid a flurry of allegations of wrongdoing. The court, which was appointed by the junta, dissolved the party and banned Thaksin and other party leaders from politics for five years. "The Thai Rak Thai party did not respect the rule of law," one judge said, adding that it "cannot exist as a political party." Analysts said the move raised question marks over the credibility of polls and the restoration of democracy promised by the military junta. "I think it is going to be very rocky, very turbulent, unless they can win over Thai Rak Thai voters," said political analyst Thitinan Pongsudhirak at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. "They have not made any effort to do that. ... There is a big gap here, there is a neglected electorate," he added. Chaturon Chaisang, the current leader of TRT, on Thursday called the verdict an attempt to punish elected leaders. "It's as if my party members were executed for breaking a glass window while those who made the rules had burned down the house," the former deputy prime minister told media. "We are banned from politics ... by orders of a military regime which destroyed democracy," he said. The TRT leader also urged the movement's estimated 14 million loyalists to respect the ruling for the sake of national stability. Authorities deployed hundreds of police on the streets and some 15,000 soldiers on alert ahead of the ruling, and Prime Minister Surayad Chulanont has said he may impose a state of emergency if there is any unrest. Some ordinary Thais felt the TRT had been unfairly singled out by Thailand's military-backed government, as the rival Democrat Party was cleared of fraud by the same tribunal. "The ruling was definitely influenced by the military rulers. They are afraid that Thaksin would come back to take revenge," motorcycle taxi driver Boonsri Wheankaew told AFP. "The verdict is not fair as only the TRT is banned but the Democrat Party survives," said the 39 year-old. Democrat leader Abhisit Vejjajiva thanked the tribunal and said his four-million-strong party was looking forward to the December polls. "Tomorrow we will have a more important mission, that is to swiftly restore democratic rule under the constitution," he said. Three minor parties were dissolved by the tribunal, which also found them guilty of fraud connected to the April 2006 polls.

http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/67528.html&cid Malaysian court rejects conversion appeal of Muslim woman Malaysian court rejects conversion appeal of Muslim woman Wed, 30 May 2007 06:42:00GMT Legal General News | Kuala Lumpur - Malaysia's top court on Wednesday rejected the appeal of a woman to be recognised as a Christian in a landmark case highlighting religious controversies in this mainly-Muslim nation. Lina Joy, who was born a Muslim and known as Azlina Jailani, had applied for both her name and religion to be changed on her identity card in 1999. While allowing her name-change, the National Registration Department refused to drop her religion as Muslim from the identity card, saying she had to appeal to the Islamic sharia courts. However, Joy embarked on a legal battle in the secular courts, arguing that she was a Christian and therefore no longer bound by Islamic law. A three-panel judge on Wednesday ruled by a 2-1 majority that only the Islamic Sharia Court has the power to allow her to remove the word "Islam" from the religion category on her identity card. Dissenting Judge Richard Malanjum said it was unconstitutional for the registry department to insist that Joy turn to the Sharia Court, were she was likely to face criminal prosecution for seeking to convert. Malanjum ruled that she was "entitled to have an identity card where the word Islam does not appear" as she had converted to Christianity. Malaysia's Islamic courts have a different set of rules and requirements according to different states. Currently, only one state out of 14 has provisions for Muslims to convert. In other states' religious departments, apostasy is a crime punishable by fines and jail sentences and offenders are often sent to prison-like rehabilitation centres. "It is indeed a very disappointing ruling," said Ivy Josiah, head of the Woman's Aid Organisation, a local NGO fighting for rights of women. "The bottom line is, we have a woman who wants to be a wife, a mother, and now she does not have that right," Josiah told reporters. Joy, who was not present at Wednesday's hearing, was said to be in hiding with her Catholic fiance for protection. She has been unable to get married as her husband would have to embrace Islam as long as she was legally Muslim under the country's laws. Outside the courtroom in Malaysia's administrative capital of Putrajaya, more than 300 Muslims representing as many as 80 Islamic groups gathered to pray for the courts to deny Joy's appeal. Yusri Mohamad, president of the Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia, welcomed the decision, saying that the court proceedings had been "an attempt to deconstruct and revamp our current formula, a winning formula" for a peaceful multi-religous society. Lawyers for Joy have declined to say what her next move would be, but Wednesday's court remains the last legal avenue for her. "The outcome of this case has shown that we have a constitutional guarantee of freedom which cannot be enforced because our civil courts have no jurisdiction over religious matters," said Leonard Teoh, a lawyer representing the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Sikhism. "The only avenue now is for us to take a political approach. We will approach the political leaders," said Teoh. "People like Lina Joy should not be trapped in any religion." About 60 per cent of Malaysia's 26 million people are Malay Muslims, whose civil, family, marriage and personal rights are decided by Sharia courts. The minorities - the ethnic Chinese, Indians and other smaller communities - are governed by civil courts.

Lavrov, accused the United States of starting a new arms race and implicitly threatened to veto any United Nations Security Council resolution that, like the one proposed by the United States and its European allies, would recognize the independence of Kosovo. Even as the White House and the Kremlin were announcing plans for a rare kiss-and-make-up meeting between President Bush and President , their top diplomats were clashing here in the historic castle where Churchill, Truman and met to decide how to carve up Germany after World War II. This time, the big issue was the carving up of the former Yugoslavia, where the mostly Albanian-inhabited province of Kosovo wants to secede from Serbia. That, along with the American plan to place antimissile bases in Poland and the Czech Republic, has pitted Russia against the West in a war of words with flashbacks to the cold war. Mr. Lavrov harshly criticized Washington&#8217;s plan to build a missile shield over countries that were once part of the Soviet sphere of influence. And he took issue with Secretary of State for calling Russian concerns about it ludicrous. &#8220;All they&#8217;re saying is, &#8216;Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s not aimed at you,&#8217; &#8221; Mr. Lavrov said at a news conference after the meeting. &#8220;It&#8217;s such answers that are ludicrous.&#8221; &#8220;We quite agree,&#8221; Ms. Rice said with a sly smile, countering that Russian officials themselves have bragged that their strategic defense systems can easily overwhelm any missile defense system that the United States puts up in Europe. Mr. Lavrov was having none of it. &#8220;I hope that no one has to prove that Condi is right about that,&#8221; he interjected. Their clashes are indicative of a chill in their countries&#8217; relations. In February, Mr. Putin delivered a blistering speech accusing the United States of undermining international institutions and making the Middle East more unstable through its clumsy handling of the Iraq war. Russia is also deeply unhappy about the expansion of into the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and about the perception in Russia that the West has supported groups that have toppled other governments in Moscow&#8217;s former sphere of influence. Mr. Bush, Ms. Rice and Secretary of Defense have tried, without success, to reassure the Russians that the missile system is aimed at preventing attack by the likes of Iran or North Korea. The tensions have heightened to the point that the two countries have decided to hold a one-on-one session between Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush on July 1 in Kennebunkport, Me. But it is hard to see how that will tone down the sparring, given how far apart the two behemoths are on Kosovo. The United States and its Western European allies favor a draft resolution endorsing supervised independence for Kosovo, where a NATO bombing campaign in 1999 helped defeat Serbian forces. Russia is adamantly opposed. At the meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Lavrov repeatedly questioned why the United States was so intent on resolving Kosovo&#8217;s status when other areas of the world were in dispute. &#8220;Lavrov said, &#8216;Why don&#8217;t we solve the case of Western Sahara first?&#8217; &#8221; said a European official who was at the session, speaking on condition of anonymity under customary diplomatic rules. &#8220;He even brought up Abkhazia,&#8221; the obscure Black Sea region that has been trying to secede from Georgia. &#8220;And every time Lavrov said something, Condi would jump in,&#8221; the official said. &#8220;It was like tennis.&#8221; Mr. Lavrov did not tone down his ire over the Kosovo plan after the meeting, when the foreign ministers held their news conference and most tried to act cordial. He hinted, as Russian officials have before, that Russia would veto any Security Council resolution seeking to recognize Kosovo as an independent country, unless Serbia agreed first, which diplomats said was very unlikely. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine a situation where the Security Council will approve such a resolution,&#8221; Mr. Lavrov said. &#8220;Such a situation will not happen.&#8221; A senior Bush administration official acknowledged that the administration, in more than six years, had not figured out how to manage its relationship with Russia. &#8220;There are a lot of things we have that are of common interest, and at the same time, we need to push where necessary,&#8221; said the official, speaking anonymously under diplomatic rules. &#8220;And to be able to do both things at the same time is hard, particularly for American administrations. We either tend to do one or the other, and for this to work we have to do both.&#8221; More Articles in International &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

A U.S. military statement, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" on Thursday in Sadr City.(AP Photo/Karim Kadim) BAGHDAD - A suicide bomber hit a police recruiting center Thursday in Fallujah, killing as many as 25 people, police said. The U.S. military said only one policeman was killed and eight were wounded. U.S. forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al-Qaida gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. The American military also reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed Wednesday in a roadside bombing in Baghdad and one who died of wounds from a roadside bomb attack northwest of the capital Tuesday. At least 122 American forces have died in May, the third-deadliest month of the Iraq conflict. U.S. forces also continued a search for five Britons who were kidnapped Tuesday in Baghdad, as well as for two of its soldiers who have been missing since a May 12 ambush south of the capital. The Fallujah suicide bomber killed at least 10 policemen in the attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. The rest of the dead were civilians, many of them in line seeking jobs as policemen. He said as many as 50 were wounded. Fallujah General Hospital had received 15 bodies and 10 wounded, according to a doctor there, who would not allow the use of his name because he feared retribution. The physician said he believed other casualties were taken to the nearby Jordanian Hospital and private clinics. A member of the Fallujah city council, who also asked for anonymity for fear of attack by insurgents, said there were at least 20 killed and 25 injured. The coordination of information in Fallujah was particularly difficult because the mobile telephone system has been working only sporadically. Maj. Jeff Pool of the Multi-National Force-West said the Anbar province governor's office and the provincial police put the total number of dead at one Iraqi policeman, with six police and two civilians wounded in Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated explosives in his vest at the third of four checkpoints, standing among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only opened Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The U.S. military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaida. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of Sunni insurgents and al-Qaida throughout the war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents called for U.S. help. Members of al-Qaida, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final exams, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from al-Qaida. Clashes continued into the afternoon, and the council official said the al-Qaida leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the U.S. military. U.S. forces, meanwhile, pressed on with the search for five kidnapped Britons, and a procession of mourners, some of them women wailing and beating their chests, marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a U.S. helicopter strike before dawn. The U.S. military said it had no report of airstrikes in Sadr City and that there were no civilian casualties in the second day of a search for the Britons, who were abducted Tuesday from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad. A U.S. military statement, however, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. AP Television News videotape from Sadr City showed the coffins of the victims atop a small bus with men and women walking behind, crying. A young boy could be seen sitting next to the coffins. A car in the area was punctured with big holes, as if hit by an airstrike. A police officer in Sadr City, who refused to allow use of his name because he feared retribution, said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 a.m., killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home , a common practice in Iraq's extreme heat through late spring and summer. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was wounded. Also in Sadr City raids, which the U.S. has been conducting with a select unit of Iraqi army forces, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi claimed his home was raided and ransacked by American forces at 3 a.m. Thursday. The military said it had no report of the incident. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. Dozens of U.S. Humvees and Bradley fighting vehicles had taken up positions around Sadr City at nightfall Wednesday. The five kidnapped Britons included four bodyguards working for the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld and one employee of BearingPoint, a U.S.-based management consulting firm. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. The Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, claimed responsibility. Wiggins also said that more than 100 patrols a day were being launched to search for two missing troops who vanished after a May 12 ambush near Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. Four Americans and one Iraqi soldier were killed in the attack and the body of another American was later found in the Euphrates River. "Our determination and resolve to locate our missing soldiers is unwavering," Wiggins said.

Malaysia's highest civil court on Wednesday rejected Lina Joy's appeal to have the word "Islam" stricken from her national identity card. The verdict was seen as a blow to religious freedom in this ethnically diverse country made up of Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs. "I am disappointed that the Federal Court is not able to vindicate a simple but important fundamental right that exists in all persons: Namely, the right to believe in the religion of one's choice," Joy said in a statement released through her lawyer, Benjamin Dawson. "The Federal Court has not only denied me that right but (denied it) to all Malaysians who value fundamental freedoms," she said. About 60 percent of Malaysia's 26 million people are Malay Muslims, whose civil, family, marriage and personal rights are decided by Shariah courts. The minorities &mdash; the ethnic Chinese, Indians and other smaller communities &mdash; are governed by civil courts. But the constitution does not say who has the final say in cases such as Joy's when Islam confronts Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism or other religions. The founding fathers of Malaysia left the constitution deliberately vague, unwilling to upset any of the three ethnic groups dominant at the time of independence from Britain 50 years ago, when building a peaceful multiracial nation was more important. The situation was muddied further with the constitution describing Malaysia as a secular state but recognizing Islam as the official religion. In its verdict Wednesday, the Federal Court said Joy &mdash; who was born to Muslim parents and began attending church in 1990 &mdash; should seek permission to renounce Islam from Islamic Shariah courts. Joy, however, has refused to seek the Shariah court's permission, saying she is a Christian and should not be bound by Islamic laws. If she continues to practice Christianity, she faces being charged with apostasy, which is punishable by a jail sentence and fine. She also has the option to leave the country. Asked if she will take that option, Joy, 43, said in her statement: "It would be extremely difficult to exercise freedom of conscience in the present environment." Dawson, her lawyer, said the media are free to draw their conclusion from the statement. Joy, who was baptized in 1998, was successful in getting the National Registration Department to change her name to Lina Joy on her identity card. But the department refused to drop Muslim from the religion column of the card. A series of rejected appeals from 2000 onward brought her case to the Federal Court.

But there were no injuries. The rocket fire also triggered power outages in Sderot and damaged several apartments. Sderot residents whose apartments were hit escaped injury because they were either outside or in a reinforced room when the rockets landed. Islamic Jihad's military operatives and the Popular Resistance Committees took responsibility for the attacks. Before dawn yesterday, two Hamas men were killed in an Israel Air Force strike on their vehicle in the Jabalya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. It was part of an operation meant to curb the rocket fire. Mahmoud Hamud and Omar Rihan, both 23-year-old Jabalya residents, were apparently on their way to fire Qassam rockets on southern Israel. In addition, three Islamic Jihad militants were killed early yesterday in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, apparently due to the explosion of a bomb they were preparing. The number of rockets fired at southern Israel this week has significantly decreased from the dozens of Qassams fired daily since the escalation began. Hamas has limited its rocket attacks in the last few days. The change appears to be related to internal Palestinian talks, although it could also be a sign that Hamas is looking for a way out of the latest round of violence. Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh told reporters, after meeting with the Egyptian security delegation in Gaza, that his government supports a comprehensive cease-fire with Israel - meaning in the West Bank as well as Gaza. Haniyeh, who also met with Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, apparently decided to speak to the reporters in an effort to dismiss reports that he had gone underground for fear of being harmed in the violence. Also yesterday, Israel's political-security cabinet unanimously decided to carry on with the current level of the military operation in Gaza. This means the Israel Defense Forces will continue to deploy small forces in uninhabited areas in the northern Gaza Strip and send special units to populated areas, in limited numbers, while the air force continues operations there. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the heads of the Israel Defense Forces and the Shin Bet security service told the cabinet yesterday that the army's activities in Gaza have so far been "effective," leading to a drop in the number of Qassams being launched. Army gets green light A political source in Jerusalem said the army has already been authorized to expand its activities in Gaza. "Until now, only a small portion of the activities approved by the cabinet have been implemented," the source said, adding that many objectives have yet to be reached. Ministers Eli Yishai (Shas) and Avigdor Lieberman (Yisrael Beiteinu) suggested intensifying the military operation, with Yishai saying Israel should carpet-bomb Palestinian towns after calling on the residents to evacuate the area. Ministers Meir Sheetrit (Kadima) and Rafi Eitan (Pensioners) suggested that Israel produce an "Israeli Qassam" and fire it at Gaza in response to the rocket fire in Sderot. Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh (Labor) submitted to the cabinet a report on the Defense Ministry's efforts to assist Sderot residents, including the operation of a district council on sustaining the economy in emergency situations and the establishment of a "welfare war room" to assist the weak sectors of the Sderot population. Sneh also said additional funds are needed to reinforce buildings in the Negev town. From French fries to calamari rings to health food, the Taste of the City Festival has it all.

Putin slams Russian television for `cheap` foreign soap Moscow, May 31: Russian President Vladimir Putin Wednesday slammed Russian television for buying up cheap foreign soap operas. "For over 15 years our youngsters have lived under massive cultural pressure of surrogates from abroad," Putin said, charging television channels with "buying anything as long as it is cheap." "We must understand and accept the culture of other countries and learn to use their best examples. We have always done that and acted so," Putin said in televised comments. "We must first make it so our young generation grows in the beneficent atmosphere of our national culture, and promote good taste and high standards of behavior." Though foreign TV series make up only a small part of Russian television broadcasts, Russian channels often opt for outdated and second-rate films due to copyright prices. *Your friend's e-mail address: Would you believe Kevin Costner as serial killer?

In the inter-Korean ministerial talks that opened in Seoul on Tuesday, North Korean chief delegate Kwon Ho-ung called on Seoul to reconsider the postponement of rice aid to the North due to Pyongyang¡¯s failure to implement a February denuclearization agreement, according to Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Nam-shik. Unification Minister Lee Jae-joung in response ¡°explained the procedures¡± necessary for the shipment of rice, including government approval for spending from the Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund, Kim said. North Korean chief delegate Kwon Ho-ung, left, and Unification Minister Lee Jae-joung, right, talk before Wednesday's session of the 21st inter-Korean ministerial talks at the Grand Hilton Hotel in Seoul./Yonhap When it agreed in inter-Korean economic talks last month to send rice, South Korea attached a verbal condition that it can change the timing of the shipment if North Korea keeps delaying the shutdown of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon under the six-nation agreement. North Korea did not insist on the aid to the point of derailing the ongoing talks, the spokesman said. Initially, a bumpy road was expected for the ministerial talks, since the North boycotted a round of ministerial talks last July when the South postponed rice and fertilizer aid after Pyongyang test-fired missiles. In Wednesday¡¯s session, the North Korean chief delegate said the delay was not Pyongyang¡¯s fault but Washington¡¯s -- an apparent reference to hiccups in the transfer of unfrozen North Korean funds from a Macau bank. The North repeatedly called on Seoul to stop joint military exercises with the U.S. and abolish the National Security Law in these talks. For its part, the South proposed a joint conference between state-run think tanks from the two sides, bilateral defense ministers¡¯ talks, the gradual reopening of cross-border railways and the repatriation of South Korean prisoners of war and South Koreans abducted by the North. The North Koreans continued to stress ¡°nationhood¡± as they had on the first day of the ministerial meeting. Kwon said the two Koreas should tackle ¡°internal affairs¡± without the intervention of foreign forces, citing the Kaesong Industrial Complex and South Korean package tours to Mt. Kumkang as good examples of bilateral cooperation. The North Korean Workers¡¯ Party daily or Rodong Shinmun and the Chosun Shinbo, the mouthpiece of the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean Residents in Japan or Chongryon, also emphasized the phrase ¡°between the two Koreas¡± in reports Wednesday. Unification Minister Lee asked for cooperation and hard work from the North. He recounted a fable told by China's first historian Sima Qian¡¯s Shiji about a man who concentrated so hard that he could penetrate a rock with an arrow. Kwon replied the two sides are even capable of ¡°penetrating iron with water drops¡± if they work together. The negotiations continue until Thursday night, with the results announced in a joint press release.

Putin slams Russian TV for shoddy foreign fare By Guy Faulconbridge, Reuters | MOSCOW -- President Vladimir Putin said yesterday that Russian television was polluting young people's minds with cheap imports and urged broadcasters to embrace wholesome home-grown entertainment instead. The criticism fits in with a drive by Putin, who has overseen a resurgence in Russia's confidence and power on the world stage, to promote patriotic values and Russian culture. Railing against the bosses of national television stations who were among the officials attending a Kremlin meeting on culture, Putin said: "They buy anything on the international market as long as it is cheap." "For more than 15 years our youth have been living under the mass cultural influence of ersatz foreign substitutes," RIA news agency quoted Putin as saying. "We must create the conditions so that the coming of age of the younger generation takes place in a wholesome atmosphere of home grown culture, so that young people are brought up with high artistic taste and standards of behavior ." Russian state or state-controlled television channels, which have the biggest audiences, carry a mixture of news, domestic crime serials, Soviet films, Hollywood blockbusters, and reality shows. Imported franchises on Russian television include "Who wants to be a Millionaire?", which originated in Britain, and the French-owned game show "Fort Boyard." Several soap operas are based on imported concepts adapted for the Russian audience. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Canadian Forces Brig.-Gen. Tim Grant, commander of Task Force Afghanistan, speaks to reporters from Kandahar on Thursday, May 31, 2007. Military confirms Canadian soldier died in crash Updated Thu. May. 31 2007 9:29 AM ET The military has released the name of a Canadian soldier killed in a helicopter crash Wednesday in Afghanistan that left a total of seven troops dead. Master Cpl. Darrell Jason Priede was a military imagery technician -- or combat cameraman -- from CFB Gagetown, said Brig.-Gen. Tim Grant during a news conference at Kandahar Airfield Thursday. "Our deepest sympathies go out to the family and friends of this wonderful young Canadian. In working to bring peace to this troubled country he has paid the ultimate price," Grant said. "However, we should all remember that Darrell was involved in a good thing, a good fight, and we should be proud of what he has done." Priede was a passenger in the U.S. CH-47 Chinook helicopter when it went down in Helmand province, one of the most volatile regions of the country. In addition to Priede, five American crew members of the helicopter were killed, along with a British military passenger. Troops have secured the wreckage of the helicopter and are investigating the cause of the crash. Purported Taliban spokesperson Qari Yousef Ahmadi said Taliban militants shot down the helicopter, but the claim has not been independently verified. Initial reports have suggested that the helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, a U.S. official told The Canadian Press. Maj. John Thomas, a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force on Thursday, said "there will be a full investigation." "We will try to determine everything that happened and to fully investigate the site." The helicopter went down at about 9 p.m. local time Wednesday, NATO officials said. A rescue team arriving at the scene was then ambushed by insurgents and had to call in air support to ward off the attackers. One Afghan civilian was injured by gunfire. Grant declined to comment on the operation Priede was involved in because the campaign is still underway. He said fighting in Helmand province has been heavy in recent weeks, and troops are working to clear out opposition fighters so that refurbishment of the Kajaki hydroelectric dam, a major development project in the area of the crash, can go ahead. "They are certainly showing now, particularly in the Helmand River valley, that they are trying to make a last stand in this area," Grant said. "At the end of the day, though, they are not being successful. They are being pushed back, they are being defeated by the ISAF forces on the ground." In recent months, violence has centred around the Kajaki Dam area, with U.S. and British forces fighting insurgents targeting the project. CTV's Steve Chao, reporting from Kandahar, said the dam project is a centrepiece in redevelopment efforts in the country. "This is one major project that NATO is hoping will win the hearts and minds down here by providing some stable electricity," Chao told CTV Newsnet. The Chinook has two rotors and is mainly used for transport. It can fit about 40 soldiers in addition to a small crew. Eight U.S. personnel died last February when their Chinook crashed in the southern province of Zabul, but the incident was not the result of a militant attack. Another 10 U.S. soldiers died in a Chinook crash in May 2006, after an attempted nighttime landing. But a 2005 U.S. helicopter crash, which killed 16 Americans, is believed to have been caused by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by militants. In total, 56 Canadian military personnel have now been killed in Afghanistan.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/3-0&fd=R&url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21829502-2703,00.html&cid=1116817584&ei=m-xeRsngAYf40QHv7IzQDQ US bid to rescue British hostages | The World | The Australian The Australian &mdash; The World US bid to rescue British hostages US forces raided Shia militia strongholds in eastern Baghdad yesterday after mounting evidence emerged that an Iranian-backed group was behind the abduction of five Britons. According to Iraqi and British officials working on the case, the kidnapping of a British IT expert and four private security guards bore all the hallmarks of the Mahdi Army, the militant group headed by Moqtada al-Sadr. The Shia religious leader returned to Iraq last week and there have been fears he would order a new wave of attacks against US and British targets. The US military announced yesterday that two more American soldiers had been killed in Iraq, confirming that May had become the deadliest month for American forces since 2004. The soldiers were killed late on Wednesday when a roadside bomb hit their foot patrol and brought US casualties for the month to 116 - the most since November 2004, when marines fought a fierce battle to retake the city of Fallujah. April was bloody for the US-led coalition, with 104 deaths. Taken together, the two past months have been the deadliest since the war began. Also yesterday, a suicide bomber hit a police recruiting centre in Fallujah, killing up to 25 people and wounding 50, police said. In another blow, a Sunni police chief praised by US forces for clearing his city of insurgents was arrested following an investigation into alleged murder, corruption and crimes against the Iraqi people. Colonel Hamid Ibrahim al-Jazaa, his brother and 14 bodyguards were taken into custody Tuesday in the city of Hit, 140km west of Baghdad, according to a statement by the public affairs office of Multinational Corps-Iraq. The statement gave no details of the allegations. As the hunt for the five Britons continued, it has been revealed British SAS troopers hunting for al-Qa'ida in Iraq are being diverted to lead the search for the men. The SAS and the Special Boat Service, the Royal Marine equivalent of the army's elite regiment, have squadrons in Baghdad, although their main task has been to work alongside American special forces. The SAS and SBS have been engaged in covert missions against al-Qa'ida for four years, giving them experience of operating in the most hostile and complex environment. Military sources said the search would need to be done with the greatest sensitivity. The "kinetic option" used against al-Qa'ida targets - tracking and eliminating - was not going to be the best solution. US commanders have backed away from taking on Mahdi Army gunmen because of the Iraqi Government's desire to keep al-Sadr, the Islamic cleric who controls the militia force, in the political process. If his men have taken the Britons, the focus will be on negotiating the safe release of the hostages, not going in with guns blazing. The Britons - a consultant and his four armed bodyguards - were snatched late on Tuesday by a large group of gunmen in Iraqi police uniforms. In an interview with BBC radio, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari noted the raid had taken place near Sadr City, an al-Sadr stronghold. He said it was too soon to blame a specific group, but said the nature of the kidnapping clearly pointed to the involvement of one of the Shia militant groups. Meanwhile, an Iraqi court yesterday sentenced a former minister in absentia to seven years in prison for spiriting more than $US1 billion ($1.25 billion) out of the country during his brief tenure. Hazem al-Shaalan was accused along with scores of other officials of embezzling money earmarked for weapons. He denied the charges, which were first raised in 2005.

Master Cpl. Darrell Jason Priede was the 56th Canadian service member killed since 2002 in Afghanistan, his death coming less than a week after another corporal lost his life to a roadside bomb. As a surface patrol headed in to the crash site, the troops themselves were ambushed by insurgents, according to NATO. Email to a friend Under continuing fire, the patrol eventually called for an air strike to "eliminate the enemy threat," said a news release from ISAF, NATO's Afghanistan mission. All five crew members of the Chinook heavy lift helicopter and two military passengers were killed in the incident, said the release. An Afghan civilian was injured in the shooting after the helicopter went down. Priede was a combat cameraman taking part in an operation around the Kajaki damn, the scene of fierce fighting recently between mainly British soldiers and the Taliban. The U.S.-funded dam is being repaired so it can supply electricity to Kandahar and the British have fought hard to protect it from insurgent attack. The corporal's job involved recording operations so there is an accurate record of what took place. "In working to bring peace to this troubled country, he has ended up paying the ultimate sacrifice," said Brig.-Gen. Tim Grant, head of Canada's Afghanistan task force. "There is no way to comfort those who grieve at this terrible time. However, we should all remember that Darrell was involved in a good thing, a good fight and we should be proud of what he has done." Qari Yousef Ahmadi, a self-described Taliban spokesman, said in an interview the insurgents had used "new weapons" against the aircraft and they had worked successfully. "We're very happy," said Ahmadi, whose claims could not be proven independently. ISAF said only that it was investigating the cause of the downing. Amanullah, a farmer in Khanano Kaly in Helmand province, who goes by only one name, said he saw the helicopter hit the ground and that Taliban had been shooting in the area. He could not tell, however, whether the craft was actually brought down by the insurgents. Amanullah, 40, described seeing the aircraft in flames on the ground near his home. Early last Friday, Cpl. Matthew McCully, 23, died after triggering an improvised explosive device reportedly planted by the Taliban. He was part of a unit that trains and mentors the Afghan national army and was accompanying ANA troops as they led an operation against the insurgency in Kandahar province's Zhari district.

Here are excerpts of his statement. ON THE BRITISH SECRET SERVICES' ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE POISONING "It's hard to get rid of the thought that Litvinenko was an agent who got out of the secret service's control and was eliminated. Even if it was not done by the secret service itself, it was done under its control or connivance." Asked if there was evidence of their direct participation, Lugovoi said: "There is." ON ALLEGEDLY BEING RECRUITED AS A BRITISH SPY Mr Lugovoi said in 2005 Mr Litvinenko invited him to London where he proposed the idea of starting a joint business. Mr Lugovoi went on to say that he was paid too much money for giving minor consultations to British business partners. "It became clear that the fee was aimed at gradually engaging me in co-operation. The talks were becoming more open. The British started to show interest in everything: my connections, financial opportunities, if I had direct access to the Russian president's administration, as well as contacts with officers of the Federal Security Service, the Federal Bodyguard Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service. They were especially interested in an opportunity to get information about the FSB activities in the so-called English direction. "They openly begun to recruit me as a British intelligence agent. The British, in essence, suggested that I gather any discrediting information about President Vladimir Putin and members of his family. For example, it was proposed that I gather information about a state official, through whom they intended to get discrediting information about the president. In particular, they intended to lure this state official to London in order to get discrediting information about the president in exchange for silence about his personal bank accounts. I will tell investigators of the prosecutor-general's office who I'm talking about. "For maintaining an undercover connection, I was given a British mobile phone, which I was supposed to use for calling from Moscow to London. From bad to worse: Litvinenko gave me an edition of Yevgeny Grishkovets' book Rubashka and told me that now we have to use cipher like in spy movies and to encode a text using numbers of pages, paragraphs and lines. "One has to be a complete idiot not to understand that under the pretext of developing a joint business, a banal recruiting was going on with concrete political and intelligence goals with regard to Russia and its president. "I do not regard myself a passionate supporter of President Putin and I have my personal reasons for that, which many can guess about. But I was taught to defend the motherland, not to betray it. During another meeting with Litvinenko, I told him straight everything I thought about that and said that I was not interested in such business." ON ALLEGEDLY BEING MADE A SCAPEGOAT Mr Lugovoi said the British had already made up their minds that he was guilty of killing Mr Litvinenko. "For a long time I was constrained by my obligations to the Crown Prosecution Service. I was willingly co-operating with the crown prosecutor's office and I was answering every question. I was also answering all the questions that the Scotland Yard investigators were asking me. Even then I had a feeling that all the questions were just a formality and the accused were already determined, that is myself and Dmitry Kovtun. But I tried to keep all the obligations... and I was made a scapegoat." He said the British had hoped he would stay silent, but that he was not going to allow them to push their agenda. "Just think of it: they have found a Russian James Bond, who enters into nuclear centres and in cold blood poisons a friend of his and, at the same time, poisons himself, his friends, children and wife. And all that was done single-handedly by the terrorist Lugovoi. Who - as a result - loses his business and clients. And the main question: what for? Where is the motive for my crime? "London was hoping that I would keep silent as I have not been extradited... and that all the questions would resolve themselves: I would be branded as a criminal; Berezovsky would get a very good reason not to be extradited to Russia; Scotland Yard and the British special services would save face in the eyes of their taxpayers; while Russia and its leadership would be discredited for a long time. "Only none of this will happen. I am prepared to lose even more money, but I will fight for my honest name. I understand that if I went to London, I - for the sake of preserving somebody's professional honour - would be convicted, no matter what. That is why in the very near future, as we have done before, I will hire serious lawyers in London in order to defend my honest name in the British law-enforcement agencies. "If the British authorities refuse to conduct a fair trial, I will be prepared to appeal to the international court in The Hague." ON WHY HE BELIEVES THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM ARE WRONG "Now I would like to return to the issue of [Litvinenko's] death. First, I don't think you have to be a lawyer to understand that a motive is needed to carry out a crime like this. Sasha [Litvinenko] was not my enemy. I did not have any opinion on what he was doing in London, which books he was writing and who he was criticising. I have been a businessman for a long time now, and this didn't really interest me. "Second, for some reason all British newspapers are saying that the poisoning took place on 1 November, but Litvinenko and I met twice in October. Moreover, we met in his home in summer, when his wife Marina was away. By the way, Berezovsky didn't know of that meeting. It was almost the ideal place for a poisoning. However, when conditions were ideal, it didn't happen. But in a bar with a lot of people, when he could have failed to turn up, in the presence of dozens of witnesses, it happened. This means that someone wanted us to be seen together in the Millennium Bar. "Third, those who know Sasha can confirm that he never drank or smoked. Neither I nor Dima [Dmitry Kovtun] can remember whether he ordered anything, tea or water, because we were preparing to go to a football game at the time and, since it was cold, had drunk a good amount of spirits. What kind of idiot poisoner would it take to act in such a primitive way? Again, somebody wanted to set us up. "Fourth, if the poisoning took place on 1 November, then how did the polonium leave traces [changes track], I underline, it only left traces in places in London where I and Litvinenko met in October. And why was the polonium found in aircraft on which Dima and I returned to Moscow and Germany respectively in October 2006? My only conclusion is that we were purposely marked with polonium in order to use us in a political scandal later. "[Fifth,] I came to London with my wife and children to go to a football game. As a consequence, all of them were checked for polonium poisoning and the results were not comforting. They were tested together with me in the hospital. What kind of monster would you have to be to expose the lives of your children and your wife to such threats? "Sixth, already in summer 2006 Litvinenko started giving me various little gifts. When I was tested in the hospital, all my things were checked. It turned out that souvenirs and a number of documents which Litvinenko had given me long before 1 November were splattered with polonium. I told our investigators in the Prosecutor-General's Office about this, but they said that their British colleagues weren't interested for some reason. It is possible that Litvinenko himself left the traces (of polonium), but this theory was unacceptable to the British justice from the very beginning. "Seventh, it is no longer a secret that all my meetings with Litvinenko were thoroughly followed by the UK secret services. Why didn't they follow up Litvinenko's poisoning and allow all of us to leave Britain without punishment? Why has the address where we met British agents, [names omitted], not been included among the dozens of places in London mentioned in the media where polonium has been found? I would like to know whether polonium traces was found in that office, which is in essence one of their secret meeting places."

Japan catches nearly 1,000 whales there each year in the name of research. After an acrimonious debate, a large number of countries refused to vote, saying the resolution was illegitimate. There was, however, consensus support for a motion censuring environmental groups which try to hinder Japan's Antarctic programme. Both Greenpeace and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society have tried to block the programme in recent years, culminating in a damaging collision between Japanese and Sea Shepherd vessels in the recent Antarctic season for which each party blames the other. It was just about the only sign of common ground in a day marked by the entrenched positions and political posturing which has bedevilled this organisation for years. 'Stain on the commission' Any International Whaling Commission (IWC) member is entitled to hunt whales for scientific research, but anti-whaling countries view the size and scope of Japan's programmes in the Antarctic and north Pacific as going far beyond what was envisaged when the IWC's constitution, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, was drawn up in 1946. Resolutions calling for a halt have materialised regularly. Japan is not obliged to comply with the IWC vote "Every scientific catch is a stain on the record of this commission," said Monaco's whaling commissioner Frederic Briand. "The best thing Japan could do is to reduce the size of its scientific whaling programmes around the world." The IWC's scientific committee recently reviewed Japan's Antarctic programme, and New Zealand's conservation minister Chris Carter was not too impressed with their conclusions. Japanese hunters "killed 7,000 whales over 18 years, and couldn't even decide how many whales there are," he fumed. This was in marked contrast to the St Kitts commissioner Cedric Liburd, who said: "This research provided significant data enabling us to understand the structure and abundance of whale populations. Every scientific catch is a stain on the record of this commission "I find [this resolution] extremely disturbing, vexatious and in some ways irrelevant," he said. "It is frivolous, devoid of action and meaningless." Virtually all of the pro-whaling bloc abstained from the vote, leading to a majority of 40 to 2. It makes no material difference, as Japan is not obliged to comply. Nevertheless, it is viewed by environmental groups as an important weapon in the battle for hearts and minds. Environmental organisations Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd came under fire themselves in a resolution co-ordinated by Japan and New Zealand. It was the only concrete sign so far of the common ground which both sides said they were seeking before the meeting convened. People on both sides of the debate talk about their views The resolution, which says that member governments "do not condone, and in fact condemn, any actions that are a risk to human life and property in relation to the activities of vessels at sea," passed by consensus. "We maintain that our protests are peaceful and non-violent," commented Shane Rattenbury of Greenpeace International. "Greenpeace has 35 years of history of being non-violent; but I'm sure the Japanese government will attempt to wave it in our face and say 'you shouldn't be undertaking these protests'." Sea Shepherd's record is rather different, having been implicated in attacks on whaling vessels spanning more than two decades. It is notable that while Greenpeace is allowed into the meeting here, Sea Shepherd is not. Parts of the resolution can also be interpreted as a rebuke to Japan, particularly an injunction to "have regard to protecting... the fragile Antarctic environment." The meeting looked like running late into its penultimate evening, with several major issues unresolved.

On May 30, a three-judge panel issued a split decision rejecting Lina Joy's appeal to have the word "Islam" removed from her government-issued Malaysian identity card. The ruling directed her to approach the Shariah Court should she wish to renounce her faith. Rev. Hermen Shastri, general secretary of the Council of Churches of Malaysia, was one of several Christian leaders who spoke with UCA News after the decision was announced. If the plaintiff "still seeks to be a Christian, she will find it difficult to live in Malaysia," he said. "Lina Joy and all other former Muslims who have chosen to convert out of Islam will find no redress in the country's civil courts." Catholic Bishop Paul Tan Chee Ing of Melaka-Johor, chairman of the Christian Federation of Malaysia (CFM), said in a press statement issued the same day that the federation is "disturbed and saddened by the decision of the Federal Court." The Jesuit bishop noted that the court upheld the National Registration Department's "right to insist on a certificate from the Shariah Court that she has apostatized, prior to registering her conversion in the identity card." He added that such an insistence "has curtailed the fundamental right of an individual to profess and express his or her religion as provided for in Article 11" of the constitution. According to Bishop Tan, the CFM has "noted with much concern that this decision reflects a growing trend of decisions in the courts where civil courts are abdicating their responsibility of providing legal redress to individuals who only seek to profess and live their religion according to their conscience." The prelate added that "it is now more pressing for the government and lawmakers to revisit the relevant legislation and to reinstate the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts so that equal protection of the right to choose and express one's religion is accorded to all Malaysians." Leonard Teoh, a Catholic lawyer who attended the court proceedings on behalf of the Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism, told reporters: "In the interest of racial and religious harmony, something needs to be done. People like Lina Joy should not be trapped in a legal cage, not being able to come out to practice their true conscience and religion." Joy, 42, was born Azlina Jailani. Years ago she dated a Catholic man, and eventually decided to become a Catholic herself. She started going to church in 1990, at the age of 26, and was baptized a Catholic in a church in Kuala Lumpur in 1998. She then decided to change her name to Lina Joy. In 1999, the National Registration Department, which is in charge of issuing the compulsory Malaysian identity cards, accepted the change of name but refused to remove the word "Islam" from her card, saying it could not do so without a Shariah Court order certifying she had renounced Islam. Joy then took the matter to the civil court, citing Article 11 of the constitution. Malaysia is governed by civil laws but a separate system based on Islamic law – Shariah or Shari'a – governs some aspects of Muslims' life. Renouncing Islam is illegal under this system, punishable by imprisonment or a fine. Apostates are also sent to rehabilitation centers. Muslims comprise about 60 percent of Malaysia's 26 million people. In the verdict he wrote for the Lina Joy case, Chief Justice Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim said: "Apostasy is within the jurisdiction of the Islamic law and the Shariah court. The civil court cannot interfere." The dissenting opinion came from a Christian judge, Richard Malanjum, who termed it unreasonable to force Joy to go to the Shariah Court, knowing that apostasy is a criminal offense under the Shariah law and she would be punished. Since conversion is a "fundamental right," Malanjum said, "the civil court should not decline jurisdiction." The verdict represents Joy's last legal recourse in civil court. Legally she cannot marry her Catholic partner without him converting to Islam. "Yes, Lina Joy has lost, but she has not lost her faith. She has only lost the appeal," Rev. Shastri said. According to a 2006 BBC News report, other Muslims in Malaysia have converted to other religions but keep their conversion a secret.

Speaking to reporters in Vienna Thursday - on the sidelines of a women's empowerment conference, Rice said the international community wants Iran to demonstrate that it is not seeking a nuclear weapon. Despite limited U.N. sanctions and a possibility of a tougher penalties, Tehran has continued to ignore U.N. demands to stop its uranium enrichment -- a process that can be used to make nuclear weapons. Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani and European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana are to meet in Madrid Thursday for another round of talks to try to resolve issue. Larijani says suspension of enrichment activity is not a way to resolve the dispute. On Wednesday, foreign ministers from the Group of Eight industrialized nations: Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States, renewed calls for Iran to stop uranium enrichment or face "appropriate measures." The United States and its allies accuse Iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons. Tehran says its program is for peaceful, civilian use. Some information for this report was provided by AFP, AP and Reuters.

Links from the paper Letter to the Editor Sell your car for free in print and online Place a classified newspaper ad Suicide bomber kills 20 By Fadhil al-Badrani in Falluja, Iraq May 31, 2007 09:07pm A SUICIDE bomber killed at least 20 people and wounded another 20 in the Iraqi city of Falluja today, police and hospital officials said. Falluja police spokesman Hamid Abid said the bomber, wearing a suicide explosives vest, walked up to a queue of about 150 young men at a police recruitment centre and blew himself up. Mr Abid put the total number of killed and wounded at between 45 and 50. Bilal Mohammed, a doctor at Falluja hospital, said 20 had been killed and 20 wounded. Falluja, 50km west of Baghdad, is in restive Anbar province, a stronghold of Sunni Arab insurgency. Recruitment centres for Iraqi security forces are common targets for such attacks, which are mostly blamed on Sunni Islamist al Qaeda. Some Sunni Arab tribes in Anbar have been encouraging young men to join the Iraqi security forces in Anbar as part of a new strategy to combat al Qaeda in the area. Al-Qaeda in turn has been waging a campaign against tribes who co-operate with authorities in Anbar. The US military has more than 6000 troops in Anbar, where local commanders have said that al Qaeda accounts for about 75 per cent of militants in and around Falluja.

BAGHDAD &#8211; Hundreds of Iraqi and U.S. troops cordoned off sections of Baghdad's Sadr City slum Wednesday and conducted a series of raids after five British citizens were abducted from a nearby government building, police and residents said. British Embassy officials held ongoing talks Wednesday with Iraqi officials to discuss the situation, Britain's Foreign Office said. Britain's COBRA crisis committee was also to meet for the second day. The five men were pulled out of a Finance Ministry office by about 40 heavily armed men in police uniforms in broad daylight Tuesday and driven in a convoy of 19 four-wheel-drive vehicles toward Sadr City, according to Iraqi officials in the Interior and Finance ministries. A senior Iraqi official said the radical Shiite Mahdi Army militia was suspected in the attack. British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said officials were doing all they could to secure the &#8220;swift and safe return&#8221; of the five. &#8220;This is clearly a very distressing time for all concerned,&#8221; she said, arriving at a Group of Eight meeting in Potsdam, Germany. Foreign Office officials are &#8220;offering help and assistance to the next of kin&#8221; of the Britons, Beckett said. &#8220;It is not helpful at this stage to speculate on what might have happened,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are working closely with the Iraqi authorities to establish the facts and doing all we can to secure their swift and safe return.&#8221; Soon after the abduction, Iraqi forces established a special battalion of Iraqi soldiers and police to search for the men, said Brig. Gen. Qassim al Musawi, an Iraqi army spokesman. &#8220;We are conducting search operations near the site where the abduction took place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Maybe today or in the coming few days, we will find them with the help of secret intelligence.&#8221; Residents of Sadr City said hundreds of U.S. and Iraqi troops sealed off areas of the Shiite neighborhood overnight and carried out a series of arrest raids that lasted until dawn. The residents spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals for speaking to the Western media. The U.S. military said it had arrested five suspected militants and one suspected leader of a militant cell during early morning raids in Sadr City. Those arrested were believed to be part of a cell that smuggled weapons in from Iran and sent militants to Iran for training, the statement said. The statement did not link the raid to the missing men. Two civilians were killed and four others injured in crossfire from gunbattles that broke out in one of the raids, police said. The civilians had been sleeping on their roofs in a traditional Iraqi custom to escape the brutal heat, police said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. The U.S. military, responding to a query from The Associated Press, said in an e-mail that it had conducted two raids in Sadr City but that no shots were fired. A roadside bomb that apparently targeted a passing police patrol in Sadr City, missed and killed one civilian and wounded four others, police said. In other violence, several mortar rounds apparently targeting an American military base in the restive city of Fallujah missed their mark and landed instead on a courthouse and in a residential neighborhood, killing nine civilians and wounding 15 others, according to police and Dr. Anas al-Rawi, of Fallujah General Hospital. A police commander's convoy was struck by a roadside bomb in the town of Hamzah, south of Baghdad, killing two guards and injuring two others, a police officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he feared reprisals for talking to the media. Gunmen in three cars ambushed three soldiers who had stopped to drink orange juice in the center of Karbala, 50 miles south of Baghdad, and stole the nearly $396,000 in salaries they were transporting to their unit, an army official said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. The three soldiers were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the theft, the official said. The U.S. military said 10 American soldiers were killed in roadside bombings and a helicopter crash Monday, making May &#8211; with at least 113 fatalities so far &#8211; the third deadliest month of the war for U.S. troops. The Islamic state of Iraq, an al-Qaeda front group, claimed responsibility for shooting down the helicopter in a statement posted on a militant Web site. The claim could not be independently verified. The military did not say if the helicopter was shot down or had mechanical problems. Attacks on Iraqis raged on as well. Police and morgue officials contacted by the AP reported at least 120 people killed or found dead. All of the officials refused to allow use of their names fearing they could be targeted by militants. Police said two car bombers hit neighborhoods on opposite sides of the Tigris River on Tuesday, killing 40 people and wounding more than 100 others. A Shiite mosque was destroyed in the second of the two attacks, in the Amil neighborhood in west Baghdad. Hours after the British were abducted, Joe Gavaghan, a spokesman for Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld, confirmed that four of its security workers and one client were kidnapped. All four GardaWorld workers are British citizens, he said, declining to provide more details. A spokesman for BearingPoint, a McLean, Va.-based management consulting firm, said one of the company's employees, apparently the client referred to by Gavaghan, was among those abducted. If the kidnappings are the work of the Mahdi Army, as asserted by several Iraqi officials, they could be retaliation for the killing by British forces last week of the militia's commander in Basra. Canon Andrew White, the Anglican vicar of Baghdad, who lives in the Garda World compound and is involved in efforts to free the men, said it's &#8220;a strong possibility&#8221; the kidnapping was a retaliation for the killing. &#8220;We have been in contact with (the Mahdi Army) and are doing our best to try and continue that contact throughout the day,&#8221; he told BBC radio. The raid was reminiscent of an attack by the Shiite militiamen, dressed as Interior Ministry commandos, who stormed a Higher Education Ministry office Nov. 14 and seized as many as 200 people. Dozens of those kidnap victims have never been found. Maj. Gen. Abdul-Karim Khalaf, the Interior Ministry spokesman, said the abduction Tuesday was carried out by men wearing police uniforms who showed up at the Finance Ministry data collection facility in 19 four-wheel drive vehicles of the type used by police. He said the band of kidnappers sped off across the Army Canal to the east. Sadr City, the Shiite Mahdi Army stronghold, is directly east of the Canal. &#8220;We are pursuing this case very vigorously, first to release them, secondly to establish the truth of what happened, who was responsible,&#8221; Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told BBC radio on Wednesday. Zebari said that the government has long believed that its security forces were infiltrated by militia members. &#8220;The number of people who were involved in the operation &#8211; to seal off the building, to set roadblocks, to get into the building with such confidence &#8211; (means they) must have some connection,&#8221; he said.

Ono was part of a canine-chewing stunt at a London radio station yesterday, reports Reuters, in which gonzo artist Mark McGowan ate cooked pieces of a Corgi, Queen Elizabeth II's dog of choice. McGowan staged the Fido-feeding (pictured above left) to protest the Queen's husband's treatment of a fox on a hunt last year. While the artist did his best to swallow a few chunks of Corgi (which had been minced with apple, onion and other seasonings), Yoko could only manage a small taste before looking "a bit strange," according to McGowan. Performance artist McGowan is a rabid vegetarian and animal-rights activist who once notoriously ate a swan to protest the monarchy. He says that the Corgi had died at a breeding farm.

What a bigot!!!!!!! Even if you are a vegitarian, you find a different way to protest that doesn't include eating meat. Yoko Ono is a useless piece of trash that only became famous because some beatle was stupid enough to marry her. That is the only reason she got her recording contract, cause she has proven over and over again that she has no singing talent whatsoever. Maybe her and K-fed can do an album together. Wouldn't that be a joke. A cruel one, mind you. LOSERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! on May 30th 2007 by Gary 12. Animal rights activists are LOSERS!!!! When are they going to get into their stupid skulls that human beings are NOT animals, we are ABOVE the animals. That's what happens when you make up your own stupid rules and regulations.

Perhaps I don't understand the definition of a vegetarian; he ate corgi. What am I missing here? Vegans can eat meat to make a point?

The more attention people get, the more they replicate their bad behavior so............................. on May 30th 2007 by Tired of it all 14. I must say, while i find the whole thing UTTERLY DISGUSTING myself, I also find eating pork, and 80% of the meat that we eat to be pretty gross. Why are dog lovers up in arms that he pulled the stunt. The point of it was to show that one living thing's life isn't MORE valuable than another. So how would the queen feel if someone did something vile to an animal that SHE liked as opposed to a fox which she apparently doesn't care about. How do you decide what is acceptable and what isn't? on May 30th 2007 by Julian 15. Gorgi is always better broiled with a dash of Basil.

(AFP) LONDON • A British artist has eaten chunks of a Corgi dog, the breed favoured by the Queen, live on radio to protest against the royal family’s treatment of animals. Mark McGowan, 37, said he ate “about three bites” of the dog meat, cooked with apples, onions and seasoning, to highlight what he called Prince Philip’s mistreatment of a fox during a hunt by the Queen’s husband in January. “It was pretty disgusting,” McGowan said of the meal, which he ate while appearing on a London radio station on Tuesday. Yoko Ono, another guest on the show, also tried the meat. “I’ve never tasted anything like it – it was grey and had a very funny smell. It was horrible,” McGowan said. McGowan said he was angry that the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, of which the royal family is a patron, had not prosecuted Prince Philip for hunting and killing the fox. The RSPCA said the fox did not suffer. Corgis are the favoured dogs of the Queen, who has owned more than 30 of them during her reign. The dog died of natural causes at a Corgi breeders and was prepared and cooked by others for McGowan. McGowan is well known for his outlandish performance stunts. He ate a swan in another protest against the Queen. Swans are protected by the monarchy.

Security has been tightened in Bangkok amid fears that supporters of ousted Premier Thaksin Shinawatra may react violently ahead of a tribunal ruling that may disband the country's two largest parties. The constitutional court is due to rule on Wednesday, May 30, 2007 whether the Thai Rak Thai Party of former Prime Minister Thaksin, and its Democrat Party rival, violated election laws in April last year. If found guilty, either or both parties could be dissolved, or their executives barred from public office for five years, or both. (AP Photo/Apichart Weerawong) BANGKOK, Thailand - A court ruled Wednesday that the country's oldest political party was not guilty of maligning ousted Premier Thaksin Shinawatra and urging voters to cast a "no" vote in last year's election. The ruling was the first of six charges the Constitutional Tribunal is considering against the Democrat Party. It then will consider similar election law violations against Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party. A guilty finding could result in either the parties or their executives being banned from politics. The party is "not guilty of maligning Thaksin's party Thak Rak Thai and persuading people to vote no," a judge read out to the crowded courtroom. "It did not mislead voters about Thaksin's popularity as the election commission alleged."

May 31, 2007 12:00am A PERFORMANCE artist ate what he claimed was a corgi live on radio yesterday, in protest at the royal family and its alleged treatment of animals. Mark McGowan, who once ate a swan in a performance art show, said the cooked canine -- the Queen's favourite breed of dog - tasted "really, really, really disgusting". The artist said Yoko Ono, who featured on the same radio program, "looked a bit strange" as she also tasted the dog. Ms Ono did not offer a comment yesterday. The corgi, which died at a breeding farm, was minced with apple, onion and seasoning for the vegetarian and animal rights activist's consumption on London-based arts station 104.4 FM. "I know some people will find this offensive and tasteless, but I am doing this to raise awareness about the RSPCA's inability to prosecute Prince Philip and his friends shooting a fox earlier this year, letting it struggle for life for five minutes and then beating it to death with a stick," he said. As McGowan, 37, ate the dog, he said: "It's disgusting. It's really, really, really disgusting." He added: "It's all wrong - it's really, really wrong. The protest, what Prince Philip's done - it's all wrong." The show's presenter, Bob Smith, said: "I'm not convinced it's corgi." But McGowan insisted he trusted the two women who cooked the dog. He said: "It's stinky, it's white-looking, it's not like any meat I've ever seen." The RSPCA said in a statement it had investigated the alleged incident involving Prince Philip, and found no evidence of any unnecessary suffering for the fox. The fox died of gunshot wounds, with "no evidence of other injury or trauma", it said. Poorva Joshipura, director of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said foxes were no less capable of feeling pain than corgis. Performance artist Mark McGowan dines on corgi as a protest against Prince Philip's fox hunting.

The South, which is holding a four-day reconciliation meeting with its communist neighbour this week, says it will not start shipments until the nuclear-armed North begins shutting down its reactor. More than six weeks have passed since the April 14 deadline for the North to close the Yongbyon reactor, the first step in a six-nation nuclear disarmament agreement reached in February. A banking dispute with the US which is blocking the deal remains unresolved. “Your side knows well why the implementation of the February 13 agreement is being delayed. The US is responsible for the delay, not our side,” the North’s chief delegate Kwon Ho-Ung told the South’s team yesterday morning. His comments at the closed-door meeting were quoted by South Korean delegate Ko Gyoung-Bin, who briefed the media. Ko said the North did not raise the rice issue during the morning session. But at a subsequent meeting it urged the South to “keep the promise regarding the rice shipment”, according to a unification ministry spokesman quoted by Yonhap news agency. “Because of the intervention of foreign powers, the implementation of what is agreed upon between the two Koreas is being suspended, and the inter-Korean relationship is being edged out by foreign powers,” the North’s Korean Central News Agency quoted Kwon as saying in Seoul. The North — which staged a short-range missile test last week — also took the South to task for its joint military exercises with the US, and urged it to repeal its tough National Security Law and reject outside interference. The South pressed for the gradual opening of cross-border railway services following a historic May 17 test run, and greater economic cooperation. To ease military tensions it proposed the resumption of talks between defence ministers, after the first and only meeting almost seven years ago. It called for practical steps to solve a dispute over prisoners of war and abductees, but the North reportedly made no specific response. The South says the North has abducted 485 of its people since the end of their 1950-1953 war and failed to send home 548 POWs. The North says no South Koreans are held against their will. Relations worsened last year with the North’s missile launches and nuclear test but improved after the February nuclear deal. At the last ministerial round in March, the South agreed in principle to resume annual rice and fertiliser aid which the North badly needs. UN agencies say it faces a shortfall of 1mn tons of food this year, 20% of its needs. But the South delayed the first shipment of rice, out of an annual total of 400,000 tons, until there is progress on the nuclear pact. The North refuses to move until it receives $25mn which had been frozen in a Macau bank under US-inspired sanctions. The US said the accounts were unfrozen in March but the North has had problems finding a foreign bank to handle the transfer. Seoul plans joint efforts with China, Japan and Russia to persuade its neighbour to make a start on nuclear disarmament. All are members of the six-nation negotiating process, along with the US and North Korea itself. The South Korean, Japanese and Chinese foreign ministers, at talks on the southern island of Jeju on Sunday, are expected to discuss the issue. And Seoul’s Foreign Minister Song Min-Soon will hold similar talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday on the sidelines of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue forum, the foreign ministry said.–AFP N Koreans blame US for delay in nuke pact Published: Thursday, 31 May, 2007, 01:40 AM Doha Time North Korea’s delegation head and Senior Cabinet Councillor Kwon Ho Ung (right) talks with South Korea’s Unification Minister Lee Jae-joung during their visit to Haengjusanseong, an ancient mountainside fortress, west of Seoul, yesterday North Korea yesterday urged South Korea to start delivering its promised rice aid, and blamed the United States for the delay in carrying out a nuclear disarmament pact.

McGowan said he was angry that the Royal Society for The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, of which the royal family is a patron, had not persecuted Prince Philip for hunting the killing the fox. The RSPCA said the animal did not suffer.

Place a classified newspaper ad Man eats corgi in royal protest May 30, 2007 12:00 Article from: The Associated Press A PERFORMANCE artist ate what he claimed to be a corgi live on radio tonight, in protest at the Royal Family and its alleged treatment of animals. Mark McGowan, who once ate a swan in a performance art show, said the cooked canine - the Queen's favourite breed of dog - tasted "really, really, really disgusting". According to the artist, Yoko Ono, who featured on the same radio program, "looked a bit strange" as she also tasted the dog. The corgi, which died at a breeding farm, was minced with apple, onion and seasoning for the artist's consumption on the Bob and Roberta Smith radio program, broadcast on London-based arts station 104.4 Resonance FM. Before the show, the vegetarian and animal rights activist explained his motives for the protest. "I know some people will find this offensive and tasteless but I am doing this to raise awareness about the RSPCA's inability to prosecute Prince Philip and his friends shooting a fox earlier this year, letting it struggle for life for five minutes and then beating it to death with a stick," he said. As McGowan, 37, ate the dog, he said: "It's disgusting. It's really, really really disgusting." He added: "It's all wrong &ndash; it's really, really wrong. The protest, what Prince Philip done &ndash; it's all wrong." The radio show's presenter, Bob Smith, said: "I'm not convinced it's corgi." But McGowan insisted that he trusted the the two women who cooked the dog. He said: "It's stinky, it's white-looking, it's not like any meat I've ever seen." The RSPCA said in a statement it had investigated the alleged incident involving Philip at the Queen's Sandringham estate in January and "found no evidence that an offence of causing unnecessary suffering had taken place". It added: "An independent post-mortem examination was carried out and found that the fox died from gunshot wounds &ndash; and no evidence of other injury or trauma was found. "The only witness who could have supported the version of events reported in some sections of the media refused to give a statement." McGowan said after the show that his protest had been "very provocative, intentionally". "To me it was, as an art piece, exhilarating," he added. Poorva Joshipura, director of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' European arm, said: "The idea of eating a corgi will make many people lose their lunch, but certainly foxes who are hunted for so-called entertainment, are no less capable of feeling fear and pain. "Most of the British public will agree that it is high time the royals joined the rest of us who live in the 21st century and are opposed to cruelty to animals." Royal protest ...

With regard to Foxes,yes they are beautiful creatures and as with all animals,deserve our respect but as they are a threat to other wildlife,our farming industry and are now in plague proportions,as a feral pest, their numbers need to be controlled.But of course,should always be despatched cleanly. As was seen at Sandringham.(Died of Gunshot wounds) I wonder if this chap has he ever seen how much damage they can do in a chicken pen ? In the UK,I lost several chickens and knew a farmer who lost 174 chickens in one night to one fox,which I happily shot the next day. I am pleased to say that now living in Australia,we have a more balanced view of animal rights and feral animal control.Of the 67 foxes I have shot here in 4 visits to a farm,none required a second shot and I have saved an awful lot of native animals,reptiles and birds a premature death. As probably more than 95% of the worlds population still eat meat,maybe those less informed might like to educate themselves a little more on where meat actually comes from for a more balanced view.Or they may like to try vegetarianism themselves.

Iran also refused to budge ahead of talks Thursday between Iran's chief international negotiator and the European Union's senior foreign policy official.

VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article Asked if it is time to change tactics in the world's nuclear standoff with Iran, Rice ruled out the idea of dropping a key precondition. "I think it's time for Iran to change its tactics," Rice said. There is increasing sentiment in Europe that world powers trying to engage Iran should drop the demand that Iran halt, or suspend in diplomatic parlance, disputed nuclear activities before bargaining on a package of incentives could begin. "The international community is united on what Iran should do, which is to suspend; to demonstrate that it is in fact not seeking a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power," Rice said. She spoke during a press conference with Austria's foreign minister, a year to the day after she made a dramatic outreach to longtime adversary Iran. The offer to talk "anytime, any place," was intended to inject new life into an ebbing European diplomatic effort to turn back Iran's advancing nuclear program. "I think the question isn't why won't we talk to Tehran. The question is why doesn't Tehran want to talk to us." Iran did not accept Rice's offer for the first Cabinet-level direct talks in nearly three decades because of the condition to stop enriching uranium. Enriched uranium is an ingredient for both the peaceful nuclear power Iran claims it wants or for the illicit weapons program that Washington suspects. "I repeat again that if Iran is prepared to take that course then we are prepared to change 27 years of American policy and sit with Iran to talk about whatever Iran would like to talk about," Rice said. "But that can't be done when Iran continues to ... try to perfect technologies that are going to lead to a nuclear weapon." Since Rice's offer, the Bush administration has embarked on a more cautious outreach to Iran. U.S. and Iranian diplomats have met twice to discuss the spiral of violence in . The United States accuses Iran of arming insurgents in next-door Iran, but Iran denies it. The disputed nuclear issue hangs over those limited talks. Tehran recently suggested a readiness to discuss a partial suspension of uranium enrichment, but the U.S. and key allies rejected the overture and Iran pulled back from the idea for starting talks on its nuclear program, diplomats said Wednesday With both sides back at their hard-line stances, an exploratory meeting Thursday between Iran's chief international negotiator and the European Union's senior foreign policy official was unlikely to make substantial headway, the diplomats told The Associated Press. In another sign of defiance, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad boasted that his country's military has become so strong that no adversary would risk an attack. "We have passed our point of vulnerability," he told Iranian state television. Later Thursday, Rice skipped on opportunity to continue a public argument with over U.S. plans to base a missile interceptor system in Europe. Speaking at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Rice did not mention Russia or the controversy that has dominated increasingly troubled U.S.-Russian relations in recent months. Rice referred to the Cold War roots of the organization, begun as a bulwark against the Soviet Union, and said its expansion to include all manner of nations proves her theory that some historical events that seem impossible one day become inevitable. "That is for me, a great benefit and a great inspiration in a world that is in a great deal of turmoil now," Rice said.

The unprecedented legislative move is likely to raise national and regional tensions in the deeply divided country. Lebanese authorities are holding eight people over the killing. They are four pro-Syrian generals who headed Lebanese security departments at the time and four members of a small Syrian-backed Sunni Muslim group accused of having played a role in monitoring Haririâ€™s movements. Early reports from a UN inquiry into Haririâ€™s death implicated Syrian and Lebanese security officials, but the continuing investigation has not recommended who should be indicted. Wednesdayâ€™s resolution breaks an impasse in which Lebanonâ€™s pro-western government supported the court but could not establish it domestically because of opposition from its pro-Syrian opponents in Hizbollah and other factions. It also comes as a serious challenge to the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad, which controlled Lebanon at the time of the car bombing that killed Mr Hariri in February 2005 and which has been accused of involvement in the murder by many Lebanese. Underlining fears of possibly violent consequences, there were reports of a stun grenade explosion in Beirut â€“ with no casualties â€“ immediately after the vote, even as supporters of the countryâ€™s anti-Syrian faction celebrated with fireworks. The Lebanese army was on heightened alert and most streets were empty as residents stayed home or fled in expectation of unrest. An emotional and tearful Saad Hariri, the murdered politicianâ€™s son, called the decision a â€œturning pointâ€ for Lebanon. He said: â€œWe want justice â€“ not revenge.â€ Fouad Siniora, the prime minister, whose government is under intense pressure from the pro-Syrian opposition, called the establishment of the tribunal a â€œvictory for all the Lebanese peopleâ€. Ten of the Councilâ€™s 15 members â€“ including Britain and the US â€“ agreed the measure after weeks of debate over whether the UN should interfere in a country where the prime minister and president are at odds, and whose parliament has closed because of factional disagreement over the court. The resolution followed a collapse in UN mediation efforts and a direct appeal by Mr Siniora for help. The UN vote also carries a broader message in the Arab world, where powerful security agencies are regularly accused of torture, yet remain above the law. Russia, China, Indonesia, South Africa and Qatar abstained, insisting they did want to see Mr Haririâ€™s killers brought to justice, but were concerned over continuing Lebanese divisions and a perceived encroachment on national sovereignty. The resolution will take effect on June 10, unless Lebanese factions pass it in parliament before then. Damascus has made no secret that it will abide only by its national laws and is unlikelyâ€‰toâ€‰sendâ€‰any suspects to an international tribunal.

The announcement came amid a slowdown in violence after two weeks of fighting between Palestinian rocket squads and Israeli forces. The fighting is expected to dominate the agenda of next week&#039;s meeting between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. "The president is working night and day for a mutual, comprehensive cease-fire," said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a top aide to Abbas. Abu Rdeneh said next week&#039;s summit, scheduled for June 7, "is expected in the Palestinian territories." Officials would not say where, but in the past they have mentioned the West Bank oasis of Jericho as the likely venue. While the two leaders have held a series of meetings over the past year, the Palestinians haven&#039;t hosted any of the gatherings. Olmert&#039;s spokeswoman, Miri Eisin, said a West Bank meeting is "a possibility," but said the date and location still have not been finalized. Today in Africa &#038; Middle East Jihadist groups fill a Palestinian power vacuum UN Security Council approves Hariri tribunal Sunni-Kurdish conflict worsens Iraqi disarray Olmert and Abbas promised U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice back in March to meet every two weeks with the aim of moving beyond day-to-day issues and begin discussing the outlines of a final peace agreement. However, the men have met just once since then, in April, and next week&#039;s talks will focus on the fighting. A five-month truce in Gaza unraveled earlier this month when the Hamas militant group began firing barrages of rockets into southern Israel, prompting Israel to respond with a series of airstrikes. More than 50 Palestinians, most of them militants, and two Israeli civilians have been killed. In the latest violence, Israeli aircraft attacked a Palestinian rocket-launching squad in northern Gaza Thursday. No injuries were reported. "We will actively pursue and hit these rocket launchers as well as those who operate them," said David Baker, an official in Prime Minister Ehud Olmert&#039;s office. Despite the flareup, there were signs of a slowdown in fighting. Hamas&#039; military wing, which has been responsible for most of the recent rocket fire, said it has not launched a projectile in 48 hours. "Perhaps there is an unannounced cease-fire," Abu Rdeneh said. The smaller Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for Thursday&#039;s rocket fire. In a separate incident, Islamic Jihad said two members were slightly injured in an Israeli artillery strike. But the army denied involvement. Still, the number of rocket attacks has sharply dropped in recent days. Israel resolved on Wednesday to keep striking Gaza rocket squads and said it wasn&#039;t negotiating a truce with radical groups. Israeli officials believe the Israeli air campaign is the reason for the reduced rocket fire. Abbas, a moderate who favors peacemaking, has been pushing Hamas to restore the Gaza cease-fire. But he has been ineffective in halting militant attacks. Abbas&#039; Fatah movement and Hamas are partners in the Palestinian coalition government. That partnership is extremely fragile, however, and Hamas began attacking Israel in an apparent attempt to halt a fresh wave of Palestinian infighting. Abbas has proposed a truce agreement that would commit Gaza militants to halt their rocket fire for a month to permit negotiations on a more comprehensive cease-fire including the West Bank. Militants have said a truce is out of the question as long as Israel keeps up its attacks and refuses to bring a truce to the West Bank, where it frequently conducts arrest raids. Israel has so far rejected the notion of applying the truce to West Bank, especially in light of the latest round of attacks from Gaza. Meanwhile, Hamas and Fatah are expected to meet next week to discuss shoring up an internal truce called after this month&#039;s infighting, which killed more than 50 Palestinians, said a senior Egyptian security official. Both sides have sent representatives to Cairo to individually speak to Egyptian mediators about the reasons for the latest outbreak in fighting, and the possibilities of coming to a truce with Israel. The two sides are expected to agree to form a committee that will include an impartial Egyptian observer to call judgment on violations of the truce currently holding between Palestinians, said Lt. Col. Burhan Hamad, head of the Gaza-based Egyptian security delegation. "But it&#039;s not a guarantee against fighting," Burhan warned. Although the internal truce has mostly held, mistrust runs deep. Both sides have welcomed Egyptian involvement. "We want to get out of mutual accusations through the refereeing of a third party, trusted by both sides, and that is the Egyptians," said Mohammed Dahlan, a Fatah strongman in Gaza, speaking on an Arab news television station on Thursday.

Some 2,000 people rallied peacefully near Government House a day after the ruling, shouting slogans against the coup leaders who ousted Thaksin in a bloodless putsch last year. The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article "Democracy Back, Thaksin Come Back," read one banner held by a protester wearing a "CNS Get Out" headband, referring to the name the generals gave themselves, the Council for National Security. "Although Thai Rak Thai has been banned, we still love Thaksin," Jatuporn Prompan, a rally organizer and former party spokesman, told the crowd from the stage. "The Constitutional Tribunal has ruled that Thai Rak Thai has committed a crime that was hostile to democracy. But who will make that ruling on the CNS which toppled a democratically elected government?," Jatuporn said. Earlier, Thaksin, who is living in London, issued a statement urging his supporters to accept the ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal, which found his party guilty of two charges of fraud in last year's inconclusive poll, later annulled by the courts. He also pressed the generals to speed up elections promised for December. Analysts say the plan could be derailed by unrest. "I would urge everyone to stay calm and don't make any moves," said the billionaire telecoms tycoon whose Thai Rak Thai (Thais Loves Thais) party was the first in Thai history to win an absolute parliamentary majority. There has been no violence since the ruling, but police set up extra checkpoints across the city of 10 million people. "Nothing has happened yet, but we are worried that a third party could cause trouble," the Bangkok police chief, Lieutenant-General Adisorn Nonsee, told reporters.

Huffing and puffing along Sungei Wang Plaza’s 30th birthday bash Art is his first love On the Movie Trail Department ‘wrong’ to deny Lina Joy’s request PUTRAJAYA: The National Registration Department was wrong to reject Lina Joy’s application to remove the word "Islam" from her identity card, according to Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Datuk Richard Malanjum. In his 58-page dissenting opinion in the landmark case yesterday, he noted that Joy had stated in her application that she was a Christian. "This fact was known by the NRD as early as Feb 21, 1997, when she made her application," he said. "Hence, her third application in 1999 should have been processed and the NRD should construe the series of applications as one continuous episode." Malanjum said it was not the function of the NRD to ensure that Lina had properly apostasised as such a matter should be left to the relevant religious authorities to take any action as deemed necessary. "The NRD has not shown that one of its statutory duties is to ensure that a person has properly renounced the Islamic faith in accordance with the requirements of the Islamic authorities." The judge said he agreed with Lina’s counsel that requiring production of a certificate of apostasy was not provided for in the NRD’s regulations. "The NRD had acted ultra vires or illegally," he said. Malanjum said it was wrong to apply Lina’s case retrospectively according to the amendments of the NRD Regulations in March 2000. The regulations require the word "Islam" to be included in the ICs of Malays. "Joy made the application three times from 1997 and the last one in 1999. Surely, those applications should be considered as part of a continuing act. "To confine the matter to the third application only is completely ignoring the history of the plight of the appellant in her dealings with the NRD." The judge said the insistence by the NRD for a certificate of apostasy from the Federal Territory syariah court was not only illegal but unreasonable. "The FT syariah court has no statutory power to adjudicate on the issue of apostasy. "Thus, the insistence was unreasonable for it required the performance of an act that was almost impossible to perform." The FT syariah laws did not have provisions for murtad or renunciation. Malanjum said the principle of administrative law stated that a public authority must not act mechanically and must consider each case on its merits. Hence, in ordering the NRD to remove the word "Islam" from Lina’s IC, Malanjum said the NRD must retain discretion to depart from its policy whenever public interest so demands. Lina was represented by counsel Datuk Dr Cyrus Das, Benjamin Dawson and David Matthews. The FT Islamic Council was represented by Sulaiman Abdullah while the government and NRD director-general was represented by senior federal counsel Azizah Nawawi. 3 killed, 3 injured in crash RM1b Bumi properties unsold Come dance for a good cause 600 athletes to take part in Gurdwara Cup meet Killed in freak accident Labourer hit by bulldozer Four cops claim trial to graft Appeal against ruling on witnesses’ statements New deal for plantation workers 4 footballers ‘red carded’ over drugs Prince ‘a bridge between Islam and modernity’ Risking all for love and money Land Office cuts red tape Teachers want training redefined and redesigned Cybercafes now dens for crime syndicates Strike force to protect checkpoint officers Millionaire yet to repay study loan Smart money is on Malaysia 12,000 families to be out of poor list by year-end No discrimination in education system ‘My whole family is gone now’ Two sides of Penang Allow pilgrims to ‘pay penalty here’ University gets RM3.4m boost Battle that could divide party Two-term V-P Hassan Ali pulls out of race Thousands get a taste of Sabah tradition Student defeats nation’s top chess player Vacant buildings to become prisons Dress, shoes the ‘stars’ at Nur Fazura trial Pekan Fest promises more than just fun ‘MoisturePlus’ contact lens solution to be recalled FREE!!!

Ankara sent more tanks to its border with Iraq this week as part of manoeuvres that have spurred talk of an impending cross-border military operation into northern Iraq to crush Turkish Kurd guerrillas hiding there. "This is spring planning. We can't do it in the winter when temperatures are minus 20-30 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). No new troops have been sent to the region," General Yasar Buyukanit, head of the army General Staff, told reporters. Speculation about an imminent incursion into Iraq has grown since Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said last week he saw eye to eye with the army over possible military action, despite unease in the United States, Turkey's NATO ally, about such a move. Buyukanit said last month a military incursion into northern Iraq was necessary to quash Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants based there. But he stressed on Thursday that the government first needed to make a political decision regarding such an incursion. In Turkey, parliament must authorise military action outside the country's borders. "The political authorities need to decide on this. We can't know whether we will go there and fight only the PKK or deal with (Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud) Barzani as well," he said. The United States has repeatedly urged Turkey not to send troops into Iraq, saying this would only complicate the situation. The two countries have agreed various measures, including financial ones, to try to curb the PKK. But pressure within Turkey for an incursion is growing after a suicide bombing in the capital Ankara last week killed six people and injured scores more. Authorities blamed the attack on the PKK, which denied involvement. More than 30,000 people have died in the conflict with the PKK since the group launched its insurgency in 1984. news is provided by Zoom to full size map Facts & Figures - Landmine casualties (2004) FACTBOX-Military and civilian deaths in Iraq Iran says dead rebels had U.S.-made arms -media May third-worst month for US troop deaths in Iraq Rival insurgent groups clash in Baghdad-residents Iraq says seeking release of kidnapped Britons Iraqi refugee children begin education programmes Source: WV MEERO - Cyprus Annual report &#8211; ICRC boosts aid in face of growing conflict and displacement Source: ICRC - Switzerland Amputee Cyclist to Circumnavigate The Globe For War Victims Source: Clear Path International - USA WER provides further support to Iraqi people Source: WER - UK Iraq: U.S. response to displacement remains inadequate Source: Refugees International - USA The International Red Cross helps Australian-Palestinians, who were visiting family in the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp, retrieve their belongings in northern Lebanon May 30, 2007.

Less noticed has been a jihadist element taking root in Gaza. (Tyler Hicks/The New York Times) Jihadist groups fill a Palestinian power vacuum By Steven Erlanger and Hassan M. Fattah Published: May 30, 2007 It was 2 a.m. when masked gunmen raided Al Wafa Net in the Khan Yunis camp in Gaza, where 17 young men were surfing the Net. "The gunmen tied their hands, then forced them to stand at the stairs while they broke all the screens, and then the server and the television and the photocopier," the owner, Hamad, said of the attack a few months ago. "Then they burned all 36 computers." In recent months in Gaza, there have been similar attacks on music and video shops and pharmacies accused of selling Viagra, as well as on American and United Nations schools. While a standoff between the Lebanese Army and Islamists at a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon has focused attention on a jihadist element taking root there, less noticed has been a radicalization in the Palestinian areas themselves. "There is a security vacuum that creates space for all kinds of new grouplets and forces," said Mouin Rabbani, a Jordan-based analyst of Palestinian politics for the International Crisis Group. Today in Africa &#038; Middle East Jihadist groups fill a Palestinian power vacuum UN Security Council approves Hariri tribunal Sunni-Kurdish conflict worsens Iraqi disarray Palestinian authority used to lie in the hands of Fatah, the nationalist faction once led by Yasser Arafat. But after the entry of the militant group Hamas into politics, its electoral defeat of Fatah in 2006 and the battles between them, jihadist freelancers with murky origins and links are filling a vacuum. Bush administration officials say they are increasingly concerned that Hamas and even more radical groups may be hijacking the Palestinian movement. The officials see no operational connection between what is happening in Palestinian camps in Lebanon and the deterioration in Gaza. But they do see an ideological link, with hopeless and marginalized young people turning to jihad because they believe that more secular or moderate options have failed them. An example can be seen in the squalid streets of the Ain el Hilweh refugee camp outside the southern city of Sidon, Lebanon, where people like Abu Ahmed Taha are bracing for a fight they have long been dreading. Militias in the camp of 47,000 roam the streets armed and ready; skirmishes break out sporadically and tensions have never been higher. For Taha, the real danger is that the fastest growing militias are those of jihadists with wholly different aspirations than his. "There is a central problem and that is Al Qaeda; and they are spreading," Taha said, after an emergency meeting of religious and political leaders in the camp last week to calm tensions. "The Islamic awakening has been going on for 25 years now. But this, now, is going to become a huge problem for us." Taha&#039;s fears are especially remarkable because of who he is: not a secular campaigner or Fatah apparatchik, but a senior member of Hamas. In the violent underground of the militias, men like him have become unlikely moderates, calling for calm and seeking to build bonds with the other militias and the government. Security officials and analysts say Al Qaeda-inspired groups have had a presence in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon for a decade, where they have thrived on the lawlessness and poor living conditions. In Lebanon, Palestinians are not allowed to own property, are limited in the kind of work they can do and generally enjoy few rights. Ain el Hilweh, too, became a jihadist hotbed about five years ago. More than 25 men from there alone have gone to Iraq to fight, Hamas and Fatah officials say, never to be seen again. And jihadists there say more are ready. Taha notes that the new groups make it easy to join. Whereas it may take years of inculcation for a young man to become a full-fledged member of Hamas, they become members of the militias in weeks, he said. And rather than focusing on a political education, they focus on a global fight. A spokesman for Fatah al Islam, the group holed up in the Palestinian camp near the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, said Islamic rule in the region is their aim. A Palestinian state is not even mentioned. "Our goals are beyond Lebanon," said the spokesman, Abu Salim, in a telephone interview. "We want the Levant to be governed by Islam again and then in the whole world. We want to bring people back to Islam, and we want to liberate our land occupied by Zionists." Whether groups like his are part of Al Qaeda or simply local bands of religious fanatics, Westerners and their institutions are now more clearly under attack throughout the region, including in Gaza, as seen in the bombing of the schools and in the kidnappings of two Fox News correspondents and of Alan Johnston, the BBC Gaza correspondent, held since March, in an act claimed by a shadowy group called the Army of Islam.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/8-5&fd=R&url=http://rawstory.com/news/afp/Vote_boycott_over_Japan_mars_whalin_05312007.html&cid=1116354652&ei=m-xeRsngAYf40QHv7IzQDQ The Raw Story | Vote boycott over Japan mars whaling talks Vote boycott over Japan mars whaling talks Published: Thursday May 31, 2007 An unprecedented voting boycott of a resolution on Japan's "lethal" whale hunts marred talks Wednesday of the International Whaling Commission, intensifying rifts in the 75-nation group. The resolution urging Japan to suspend the "lethal aspects" of its scientific whaling program was adopted 40-2 but prompted a boycott by Japan and 26 other mostly pro-whaling nations making up more than one third of the IWC. The non-binding resolution was proposed by New Zealand and sponsored by other anti-whaling nations led by the United States, Britain, Australia, France and South Africa at the annual talks in Anchorage, Alaska. Russia and Norway voted against it while China abstained. "It was a clear division showing the different philosophical camps that are here in the IWC," New Zealand's Conservation Minister Chris Carter told AFP. "It will be bad enough if Japan was just harpooning whales along its own shores but actually it comes down and harpoons our whales," he charged. Japan shot back, calling the move a "hate" resolution. "We had a spirit of compromise at this meeting and the anti-whalers just can't help themselves but to pass hate resolutions," said Japanese delegation spokesman Glenn Inwood. For the first time in IWC history, more than two dozen countries refused to participate in the vote, saying it was divisive and served no purpose, officials said. It underscored the increasing division within the 75-member IWC, which has nearly an equal number of pro- and anti-whaling nations, making it difficult for key policy changes in the commission that require a three-fourths majority. "It was the wrong resolution, at the wrong time and delivered in the wrong tone. It has further undermined the relevance of the IWC," said Eugene Lapointe, president of the International Wildlife Management Consortium World Conservation Trust, a pro-sustainable use group. The IWC, which manages whaling and is in charge of conservation of the creatures, had imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling since 1986 but Japan, according to environmentalists, is exploiting a legal loophole allowing whaling for scientific research. Japan kills about 1,000 whales a year under its scientific program then sells the meat. The Latin American bloc, that included Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico, also voted against Japan on Wednesday. "We are really pleased that all Latin American countries supported us, it shows that the south hemisphere countries are passionate about protecting whales," Carter said. Last year, the anti-whaling group did not risk such a resolution because the whaling countries and their supporters had voting parity with them and it may have been defeated, officials said. Japan last year won a non-binding resolution in favor of commercial whaling, but fell short of the numbers needed to overturn the two-decade moratorium. This year, the anti-whaling group has a narrow majority. Also on Wednesday, Japan made a formal bid at the IWC to overturn the moratorium even though it is expected to fail and worsen a split in the group. Top Japanese delegate Joji Morishita argued that the moratorium had to be lifted to allow Japan's traditional coastal communities to conduct whale hunts. He said they had the same fundamental right to pursue whaling as natives in the United States and Russia. Japan submitted the proposal under the same IWC rules allowing aboriginal subsistence whaling quotas, saying whaling culture dates back centuries ago in the richest Asian nation. "Whales are part of Japanese dietary culture and to tell Japan to stop is nothing short of cultural imperialism," Inwood said. The United States, Britain, India, France, Australia and Brazil spoke against the Japanese move. During the debate, British Biodiversity Minister Barry Gardiner was cautioned after using what was termed "derogatory" language. He branded Japan a "perpetrator," implying that Tokyo's scientific whaling was unlawful although IWC rules allow such an activity. Gardiner said based on the tone of Morishita's remarks, "delegates might be forgiven for thinking that Japan is the victim here." He then said, "It is not. It is a perpetrator." The delegate from Norway, a Japan ally and a fiercely pro-whaling nation together with Iceland, cautioned that the word "perpetrator" could be a "derogatory" term. IWC chairman William Hogarth, noting the sensitivities involved among the diverse group of countries at the talks, pleaded for restraint in comments. IWC meetings have always been characterized by strong language and emotional arguments.

Canadian Forces Brig.-Gen. Tim Grant, commander of Task Force Afghanistan, speaks to reporters from Kandahar on Thursday, May 31, 2007. Military confirms Canadian soldier died in crash Updated Thu. May. 31 2007 9:29 AM ET The military has released the name of a Canadian soldier killed in a helicopter crash Wednesday in Afghanistan that left a total of seven troops dead. Master Cpl. Darrell Jason Priede was a military imagery technician -- or combat cameraman -- from CFB Gagetown, said Brig.-Gen. Tim Grant during a news conference at Kandahar Airfield Thursday. "Our deepest sympathies go out to the family and friends of this wonderful young Canadian. In working to bring peace to this troubled country he has paid the ultimate price," Grant said. "However, we should all remember that Darrell was involved in a good thing, a good fight, and we should be proud of what he has done." Priede was a passenger in the U.S. CH-47 Chinook helicopter when it went down in Helmand province, one of the most volatile regions of the country. In addition to Priede, five American crew members of the helicopter were killed, along with a British military passenger. Troops have secured the wreckage of the helicopter and are investigating the cause of the crash. Purported Taliban spokesperson Qari Yousef Ahmadi said Taliban militants shot down the helicopter, but the claim has not been independently verified. Initial reports have suggested that the helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, a U.S. official told The Canadian Press. Maj. John Thomas, a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force on Thursday, said "there will be a full investigation." "We will try to determine everything that happened and to fully investigate the site." The helicopter went down at about 9 p.m. local time Wednesday, NATO officials said. A rescue team arriving at the scene was then ambushed by insurgents and had to call in air support to ward off the attackers. One Afghan civilian was injured by gunfire. Grant declined to comment on the operation Priede was involved in because the campaign is still underway. He said fighting in Helmand province has been heavy in recent weeks, and troops are working to clear out opposition fighters so that refurbishment of the Kajaki hydroelectric dam, a major development project in the area of the crash, can go ahead. "They are certainly showing now, particularly in the Helmand River valley, that they are trying to make a last stand in this area," Grant said. "At the end of the day, though, they are not being successful. They are being pushed back, they are being defeated by the ISAF forces on the ground." In recent months, violence has centred around the Kajaki Dam area, with U.S. and British forces fighting insurgents targeting the project. CTV's Steve Chao, reporting from Kandahar, said the dam project is a centrepiece in redevelopment efforts in the country. "This is one major project that NATO is hoping will win the hearts and minds down here by providing some stable electricity," Chao told CTV Newsnet. The Chinook has two rotors and is mainly used for transport. It can fit about 40 soldiers in addition to a small crew. Eight U.S. personnel died last February when their Chinook crashed in the southern province of Zabul, but the incident was not the result of a militant attack. Another 10 U.S. soldiers died in a Chinook crash in May 2006, after an attempted nighttime landing. But a 2005 U.S. helicopter crash, which killed 16 Americans, is believed to have been caused by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by militants. In total, 56 Canadian military personnel have now been killed in Afghanistan.

Shakeri, a California-based businessman who also works for a private conflict-resolution group called the Center for Citizen Peacebuilding, has been detained in Tehran's Evin prison, State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said. Iranian officials confirmed on Tuesday that two other US-Iranian scholars, Haleh Esfandiari and Kian Tajbakhsh, had been detained on spying charges and that a fourth dual national, journalist Parnaz Azima, faced similar allegations but had not been arrested.

A multi-ethnic state composed largely of Muslim Malays, Christian and Buddhist Chinese, and Hindu and Sikh Indians, Malaysia has long prided itself on its diversity of faiths. To safeguard this religious heterogeneity, the country's constitution sets out a dual-track legal system in which Muslims are bound by Shari'a law for issues such as marriage, property and death, while members of other faiths follow civil law. Malaysia at a Crossroads The culturally diverse nation is struggling to strike a balance between its secular constitution and its Muslim majority A New vision for Malaysia Malaysians expected Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi to be cautious, but he has quickly emerged as a bold reformer But the parallel system has occasionally faced snags. Joy is a Malay originally known as Azlina Jailani, and by Malaysian law her ethnicity automatically makes her a Muslim subject to Shari'a law. In order to make her 1990 conversion to Christianity legal, she needed permission from the Shari'a courts, which consider a renunciation of Islam a major offense. But, since she is still classified as a Muslim by the state, Joy was not allowed to have her case heard by the civil courts. Her six-year-long campaign to convince the civil system to legalize her conversion failed, prompting her appeal to the Federal Court, after the Court of Appeal rejected her claim in September 2005. On Wednesday, the Court announced that it had no jurisdiction over the case since it was under the purview of Shari'a law, effectively punting on any attempt to clear up the gray space that exists between Malaysia's two legal systems. The ruling was greeted by shouts of "God is great!" from many in the assembled crowd outside the Palace of Justice in Kuala Lumpur. More secular observers were far less jubilant. "I see this case not just as a question of religious preference but one of a potential dismantling of Malaysia's ... multi-ethnic, multi-religious &#91;character&#93;," warned Malik Imtiaz Sarwar, a member of Joy's legal team, before the decision was announced. The Joy verdict, which will likely become a precedent for several other pending conversion cases, is seen by many in Malaysia as evidence of how religious politics are cleaving the nation, with a creeping Islamization undermining the rights of both non-Muslims and more moderate adherents to Islam. Last November, at a party conference for the Muslim-dominated United Malays National Organization ruling party, one delegate vowed he would be willing to "bathe in blood" to defend his ethnicity &#151; and, by extension, his religion. In several Malaysian states, forsaking Islam is a crime punishable by prison time. Earlier this week, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who in December acknowledged that race relations in his homeland were "fragile," hosted the World Islamic Economic Forum in Kuala Lumpur. In an era where Islam is so often partnered with extremism and autocratic governance, Malaysia was held up at the annual conference as a model of a moderate Muslim nation committed to safeguarding the rights of its diverse population. But the Federal Court's verdict on Joy's case, which represented her last legal recourse, may undercut that reputation. After all, is it complete religious freedom if a 42-year-old woman isn't allowed to follow the faith of her choosing?

Gaza: Israeli bombing won't bring peace any more than previous military crackdowns. American-Israeli help to bolster President Mahmoud Abbas' security forces won't stop Hamas from acquiring more rockets to hurl at Israel. The Saudi-sponsored unity government between Fatah and Hamas won't end their internecine warfare. "The problem is Gaza itself," writes Fawaz Turki, author of The Disinherited: Journal of a Palestinian Exile , who lives in Washington. "Israel may have evacuated its miserable colonists and soldiers from Gaza but it continues to control its airspace, offshore maritime access and its borders, determining the flow of goods, produce and people ... "The cumulative impact of sustained economic hardship, coupled with living under the thumb of a foreign occupier can be devastating to an individual's psychological, even cognitive and social functioning ... "Communities made inert by repression, social immobility or economic deprivation, will build up an inescapable drive towards war, towards an assertion of identity at the cost of mutual destruction." The World Bank, too, recently criticized the Israeli stranglehold on Gaza and the West Bank, the latter cut up into "ever smaller and disconnected cantons." Neither the Palestinian civil war nor the breakdown of the months-long ceasefire with Israel should have come as a surprise. Lebanon: About 400,000 Palestinian refugees there remain marginalized â€“ denied citizenship and restricted to menial jobs. It is in one of their 12 camps that Beirut is battling Fatah al-Islam, which vows to "fight the Jews and take the holy war to the frontiers of Palestine." Rushing U.S. military supplies to Prime Minister Fouad Siniora may help him crush this militia, but it won't guarantee that others won't emerge. Fatah al-Islam may or may not be the creation of Syria. The more relevant point is that it is easy for anyone to start a militia in the midst of misery. The other point is that Lebanon is politically paralyzed between pro- and anti-Hezbollah elements. Attacking Fatah al-Islam is easy, disarming the Hezbollah is not, so strong it emerged from last year's Israeli invasion. Iraq and Afghanistan: The U.S. presence in both has been a boon to terrorists. The U.S. State Department says terrorism shot up 25 per cent last year â€“14,338 attacks that killed 20,498 people, most in Iraq and Afghanistan. The leader of Fatah al-Islam was an associate of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the notorious Al Qaeda terrorist who was killed in Iraq last summer. Other jihadis from Iraq may be operating well beyond Lebanon, as indicated by terrorist incidents in Morocco and Algeria. Jihadi tactics from Iraq are being copied in Afghanistan. Propping up prime ministers Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad and Hamid Karzai in Kabul won't guarantee any more success than propping up Abbas and Siniora. They have been rendered ineffective by the Israeli and American policies of occupations and endless war, with criminal disregard for civilian casualties and human suffering. Enter the radicals â€“ and Iran. Bilateral U.S.-Iran talks, long overdue and at last underway, won't end the carnage in Iraq. Tehran has little incentive to help there while the U.S. â€“ backed by some Sunni Arab dictators â€“ continues its sabre-rattling over the Iranian nuclear program. "The failure to find political and institutional solutions in Palestine, Lebanon and Iraq, along with the American rivalry with Iran for regional influence, has stirred up all kinds of conflicts and created a field day for militias, large and small," says Prof. Jim Reilly, a University of Toronto expert on the Middle East. "They have let loose a host of furies" â€“ none easily contained. , the Star's editorial page editor emeritus, appears Thursday in World and Sunday in the A-section.

Alaa Hadidi, spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, voiced the dissatisfaction over the Quartet's Wednesday statement in a speech to local diplomatic editors, the official MENA news agency reported. The Quartet statement was a tantamount to a green light to to launch more attacks against the Palestinians, Hadidi was quoted as saying. After a meeting in Berlin Wednesday, diplomats from the Quartet, which groups , the United Nations and the European Union, called for an immediate stop of violence in the Mideast region as fighting between Israel and Palestinian militants continued to flare up. Hadidi noted that the Quartet asked the Palestinians to hold their fire while urged Israel to avoid fall of civilians during military operations in the Palestinian lands. "How can Israel avoid death of civilians while using heavy weapons in bombing targets located in residential areas?" The unbalanced statement jeopardizes the credibility of the Quartet as a neutral side, warned the Egyptian official. Hadidi also rejected Quartet's call for unconditional release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit who was kidnapped by Palestinian militant groups in June last year. The Quartet remarks will not help Egyptian efforts aiming at clinching a deal to free Shalit in return for some Palestinian prisoners, said Hadidi, criticizing the international group for failing to condemn the recent Israeli "kidnapping" of Palestinian lawmakers. The Quartet statement also misinterpreted the Arab Peace Initiative reactivated by Arab leaders during their summit meeting in Riyadh in late March, which provides a complete vision of a comprehensive peace in the region that will not be realized unless Israel withdrew from all occupied Arab lands, Hadidi said. However, the Egyptian official welcomed Quartet's support for holding dialogue between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President , expressing Cairo's support to Quartet's call for an Israeli halt to settlement construction.

Lina Joy, 42, had fought the decisions of Malaysia's lower courts in an effort to have the word "Islam" removed from her identity card, arguing that the constitution guaranteed her religious freedom. But the panel of three judges decided, in a majority verdict, that it had no power to intervene in cases of apostasy. These cases fall under the jurisdiction of Malaysia's Sharia courts, which run in tandem with the country's civil courts. However, it has never been made clear which branch of the court takes precedence. The Malaysian constitution guarantees freedom of worship, but ethnic Malays must be Muslim by law. "She cannot simply, at her own whim, enter or leave her religion," Judge Ahmad Fairuz said during yesterday's ruling. "She must follow rules." But Judge Richard Malanjum, the only non-Muslim on the panel, said it was "unreasonable" to ask Ms Joy to turn to the Sharia court as she could face criminal prosecution because abandoning Islam is punishable by a fine or jail. Critics of the verdict expressed dismay and said it failed to uphold the legal rights of Malaysians. Two-hundred Muslim protesters who gathered in a prayer vigil outside the court yesterday greeted the verdict with cries of "Allahu Akbar" (God is great). Islam is the official religion in Malaysia, where 60% of the country's 27 million people are ethnic Malay. The woman, born Azlina Jailani, started attending church in 1990 and was baptised eight years later. She was given permission to change her name, but "Islam" remained as her religion on her identity card.

That, at least, was what happened when the G-8 foreign ministers gathered in Germany on Wednesday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice exchanged verbal blows at the G-8 press conference Wednesday. Clashes between Russia and the US soured a meeting of G-8 foreign ministers on Wednesday, just one week before the main summit kicks off in Heiligendamm on Germany's Baltic coast. At the press conference in Potsdam, the site of the historic conference between the victorious Allies at the end of World War II, Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov struck out at US plans to erect a missile defense system in Eastern Europe. He also criticized US policy on Kosovo and Lebanon. Lavrov accused Washington of launching a new arms race, saying that the US rationale for the shield was thin and that Moscow was not placated by the reassurances it had received. "All they are saying is 'don't worry it's not aimed at you,'" he complained. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice retorted that her country had repeatedly explained its plan to Russia. And she said that she agreed with Russian President Vladimir Putin's assessment that Russia's own strategic defenses could easily overpower the US system. "I hope that nobody has to actually prove that Condi is right about that," was Lavrov's sardonic response. The US want to deploy a radar system in the Czech Republic, along with inceptor missiles in Poland, to defend against possible threats from rogue states. However, Moscow perceives the move as part of a steady encroachment on its former sphere of influence. In the latest development in the escalating dispute between the two sides, Russia tested a new multiple-warhead intercontinental ballistic missile on Tuesday. Putin said on Thursday that the test was in direct response to US steps that have upset the strategic balance. The two ministers also announced that US President George W. Bush and Putin will meet at the beginning of July for bilateral talks at the private home of Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, in Maine. But the missile defense shield is not the only point of discord between the two countries. They are also sparring over the future of Kosovo. Russia backs Serbia, which opposes a UN plan to offer independence to the Albanian-majority province. Western powers are in favor of the plan, proposed by the UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari. "We and several of my European colleagues here believe that the Ahtisaari report provides the right basis for resolving the issue," Rice told the news conference. But Lavrov was combative on this issue too: "Our positions are diametrically opposed and I don't see any chances of the positions moving any closer together," he told the news conference. The Russian top diplomat also sniped at recent US arms shipments to the Lebanese army, which is currently engaged in fighting militants in Palestinian refugee camps, accusing Washington of "interfering in Lebanese affairs."

Chancellor Angela Merkel had hoped that the leaders of the world's industrialized leaders and Russia could reach a breakthrough on tackling climate change and poverty in Africa. However, there are already indications that the US could decide any meaningful decisions on moves to curb climate change. While the Europeans want to set strict benchmarks for emissions reductions, the US prefers increasing the use of alternative energy -- to reduce dependency on oil. Although the Potsdam meeting could hardly be deemed a great success, there were some noises of unity from within the G-8. In a joint statement the foreign ministers said that they regretted that Iran was expanding its uranium enrichment activities. And Afghanistan and Pakistan, invited by Germany to attend Wednesday's meeting, vowed to deepen cooperation between their governments "at all levels," including border management, the fight against terrorism and the issue of Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

The Taliban said 35 people died in the helicopter crash in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan. Hours after the helicopter went down, the Taliban ambushed a police convoy on a main road in southern Zabul province and killed 16 policemen, the interior ministry said. Since the traditional winter lull, the resurgent Taliban have stepped up actions in recent months with a series of suicide attacks, roadside bombs and ambushes against foreign and Afghan forces. In an apparent response to the Chinook crash, a joint NATO and Afghan raid supported by air power killed and wounded dozens of Taliban in Sangin district, close to Kajaki where the twin-rotor NATO helicopter went down on Wednesday night, the Afghan defence ministry said. NATO said the fighting was part of a broader offensive called "Operation Lastay Kulang," from the local Pashto language for "axe handle," meant to extend the Afghan government's control into the north of Helmand province. Officials said 2,000 foreign and Afghan troops, including 1,000 British soldiers and elements of the elite U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, were involved in a push to loosen the Taliban's grip on the Sangin Valley. Helmand, a long-time bastion of the Taliban, is the leading drug-producing region of Afghanistan, the world's main heroin supplier. It has been the scene of a series of bloody fights between Taliban and Western forces in recent months. &copy; Reuters 2007.

Speaking a week before he meets leaders of the Group of Eight (G-8) industrial nations in Germany, Putin said Russia's tests on Tuesday of a two new missiles were a direct response to U.S. moves to create a missile defense system. "We are not the initiators of this new round of the arms race," Putin told a joint Kremlin news conference with visiting Greek President Karolos Papoulias. "There is no need to fear Russia's actions: they are not aggressive," he said. "They are a mere response to harsh and groundless unilateral actions by our partners and are aimed at maintaining the balance of forces in the world." Putin's comments, which will be popular among ordinary Russians in a year when there is a parliamentary election, are the latest in a line of harsh outbursts against the West. Russia on Tuesday test-fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile with multiple warheads and a new cruise missiles, which Russian generals say are sufficient to ensure the country's security for the next 40 years. "Our partners are stuffing eastern Europe with new weapons," Putin said. "What are we supposed to do? We cannot just observe all this." Moscow has been alarmed by U.S. plans to deploy elements of its global missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Washington says it wants to avert attacks from "rogue states" such as Iran but Russia sees a threat to its own security. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Mr Putin said it was a "response to maintain the strategic balance in the world", in what he called a "new round of the arms race". He added that Russia would continue to improve its resources. Russia tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile, which can be armed with up to 10 warheads, on Tuesday. These actions by Russia should not be feared, they are not aggressive Europe diary: Missile defence "Our American partners have left the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty," Mr Putin told a press conference. "We have warned them then that we will come out with a response to maintain the strategic balance in the world." Mr Putin defended Russia's actions, insisting they were not the "initiators of this new round of the arms race". "(Our partners) are stuffing Eastern Europe with new weapons," he said. "A new base in Bulgaria, another in Romania, a site in Poland, radar in the Czech Republic. What are we supposed to do? We cannot just observe all this." He added: "These actions by Russia should not be feared, they are not aggressive, it's just an answer to rather tough and unjustified unilateral actions by partners." Washington wants to deploy interceptor rockets in Poland and a radar base in the Czech Republic to counter what it describes as a potential threat from "rogue states" such as Iran and North Korea. The US maintains its system is not directed at the Russians, but Moscow says its security is being threatened. Russia's test launch took place at the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia on 29 May. The missile, called RS-24, was designed to evade missile defence systems, the Russian defence ministry says. The test missile successfully struck its target 5,500km (3,400 miles) away on the far eastern Kamchatka peninsula, the Russian Strategic Missile Forces said.

(REUTERS) VATICAN CITY • The parents of Madeleine McCann, the British girl who disappeared in Portugal nearly a month ago, had an emotional meeting yesterday with Pope Benedict XVI, who said he would pray for their daughter's return. The pope spent several minutes talking with Gerry and Kate McCann — both devout Roman Catholics —following his weekly audience in Saint Peter's Square. During the meeting, the pontiff placed his hand on a photograph of four-year-old Madeleine that Kate McCann had carried with her. The McCanns, both dressed in black, were visibly moved by their meeting with Pope Benedict, although Gerry confessed afterwards to mixed emotions. "It was more personal than I could ever imagine it could have been ... and his touch, words and thoughts were more tender than we could have hoped and that will help sustain us," he told reporters. "In ordinary circumstances of course it would be the highlight of any Catholic to come and meet the pope. Of course it is saddened with the very marked realisation that our daughter is still missing," he said. Madeleine went missing from Portugal's southern Algarve holiday resort of Praia de Luz on May 3. She is believed to have been abducted as she slept with her two-year-old twin brother and sister in a hotel apartment at the Ocean Club Resort while her parents dined at a nearby restaurant. Kate McCann said the Pope had some comforting words for them both.

Mark McGowan, 37, said the cooked dog - the Queen's favourite breed - tasted "really, really, really disgusting". The corgi, which died at a breeding farm, was minced with apple and onion, reports Sky News. The artist ate it on the Bob and Roberta Smith radio programme, broadcast on London-based station 104.4 Resonance FM. Before the show, the vegetarian and animal rights activist explained his motives for the protest. He said: "I know some people will find this offensive and tasteless. "But I am doing this to raise awareness about the RSPCA's inability to prosecute Prince Philip and his friends shooting a fox earlier this year, letting it struggle for life for five minutes and then beating it to death with a stick." The radio show's presenter, Bob Smith, said: "I'm not convinced it's corgi." But Mr McGowan insisted that he trusted the the two ladies who cooked the dog. He said: "It's stinky, it's white-looking, it's not like any meat I've ever seen." The RSPCA said in a statement it had investigated the alleged incident involving Philip at the Queen's Sandringham estate in January and "found no evidence that an offence of causing unnecessary suffering had taken place". - Ananova.com Car Insurance for Women USA Green Card Program Win Now For Real Now you can get all your news - from politics in South Africa, the quirkiest stories in Step Beyond, the latest from the worlds of Motoring, Entertainment and Business - in one place. and you'll have all the latest news at your fingertips.

Minutes after the vote, which was carried live on local satellite channels, Hariri's son and heir, Lebanon's parliament majority leader MP Saad Hariri made an emotional speech, welcoming the decision and calling on the Lebanese to unite. "Let's all join hands in defending the international tribunal .. .as an opportunity for all Lebanese to unite," said Hariri in a televised statement. "This tribunal is for all Lebanon ... putting an end to the criminal terror intimidating Lebanon," said Hariri choking back tears. "We are seeking justice to hold to account the perpetrators. " Premier Fouad Seniora, also on local television stations, said the trial for the murder of Hariri would allow for "the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth" to be revealed. Seniora said that the court is not targeted at any specific country, and the passing of the resolution signified the international communities' endorsement for the independence and sovereignty of Lebanon. Seniora also urged the Lebanese to join hands and overcome their differences after the vote in New York. After the vote, celebratory gunfire were heard as Hariri's supporters gathered at the downtown grave of the former premier. As shown in local TV footage, many supporters were distributing sweets to passerby while others lit columns of candles as a tribute to Hariri. Others, however, warned of a possible flare-up of security incidents in the wake of the resolution. Echoing a warning by Damascus on Wednesday that the Security Council's move could plunge Lebanon into more instability, some critics of the tribunal also warned of possible trouble ahead. An article written by Omar Neshabi, which is carried by the pro- opposition al-Akhbar newspaper on Thursday, said setting up the court without consensus "raises serious concern for security and stability." "The establishment of the court according to an international resolution and without the agreement of a large segment of citizens... widens and deepens the fracture among Lebanese," said the article. The pro-government An Nahar newspaper, while hailing the UN resolution, voiced security concerns in its Thursday story on the vote, too. Ali Hamadeh, a columnist from the paper said "the rope was tightening around the neck of the murderers" but warned the court "may not bring immediate security. It may push those harmed (by it) to threaten, intimidate and sabotage." Within minutes after the vote, an explosion struck Beirut's Shiyyah district on late Wednesday. The blast caused no damages or casualties, but it is the sixth attack in the country since May 20, when fighting broke out between the army and militants at the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp allegedly linked to al-Qaida and The UN Security Council adopted the resolution on Wednesday to establish the international tribunal. Among the 15 members of the council, 10 voted in favor and five -- The resolution slated a grace period until June 10 for the Lebanese parties to ratify an earlier agreement reached in November by the United Nations and the Lebanese government to establish the court. Otherwise, the resolution's provisions shall enter into force immediately. Lebanese President Emile Lahoud had urged the UN Security Council to stay out of the country's political infighting and not to impose the tribunal. Lebanon is facing its worst crisis since the end of the 1975- 1990 civil war, being locked in a political impasse arose from the power struggle between the anti-Syrian bloc and the pro-Syrian opposition, with the issue of setting up of the international tribunal, along with the formation of a national unity government, being the two major points of contention. Anti-Syrian politicians in Lebanon have blamed Syria for Hariri 's killing in Beirut in February 2005. Syria has denied any involvement.

Much of his claims were taken at face value, with little attempt to analyse why MI6 would believe that the former KGB officer was interested in betraying his country and what they could have offered him as an inducement." /> Lugovoy revels in spotlight as Russia sezies on claims-News-World-Europe-TimesOnline Our exclusive four-step guide to giving up before the ban Navigation - link to other main sections from here How does the government plan to save the planet now? Lugovoy revels in spotlight as Russia sezies on claims Andrei Lugovoy's sensational accusation that British Secret Services were involved in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko led the main television news bulletins in Russia. Much of his claims were taken at face value, with little attempt to analyse why MI6 would believe that the former KGB officer was interested in betraying his country and what they could have offered him as an inducement. Mr Lugovoy gave no clue, saying only that he had evidence to support his allegations that he was willing to share with Russia's Prosecutor-General and the Crown Prosecution Service. His allegations against Boris Berezovsky, a hate figure in the Kremlin and much of Russia, were also predictably given considerable prominence in the reports. Shadowy ex-KGB major takes cover Andrei Lugovoy told Russian news agencies he had nothing to do with Litvinenko's death and that the charge is politically motivated Pushing Russia too far risks breaking political and economic bonds Full video of interview with Marina Litvinenko Litvinenko was told that he was marked for death Curse of the Moscow bombs 'British spies' killed Litvinenko, says suspect Claim by claim: Lugovoy's theories examined The level of media interest in Mr Lugovoy's press conference was extraordinary, with around 30 TV cameras from Russian and international broadcasting companies and a hall packed with journalists and photographers. Russian television swiftly broadcast reaction from leading political figures, who called for a thorough investigation. Mr Lugovoy's allegations reversed the position in which Russian officials have often been on the defensive against claims of state involvement in Mr Litvinenko's death. Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the foreign relations committee of the Duma, Russia's parliament, called the allegations "most interesting" and said: "All of these matters should be investigated very seriously and I hope we will have good cooperation from our British colleagues." Some analysts expressed scepticism at Mr Lugovoy's version of events. Peter Lavelle, political commentator on Russia Today, the state-funded English language channel, said that it did not answer the question of where the polonium-210 used to poison Mr Litvinenko had come from. Mr Lugovoy appears at times to revel in the attention he has received as a result of this case, even as he strenuously protests his innocence. He ended his press conference, broadcast live on Russian television, with a strong appeal to patriotism that appeared calculated to strike a chord with viewers. Recalling that his grandfather had fought in the Russo-Japanese war and his father in Berlin in World War Two, Mr Lugovoy said: "I was brought up as a real Russian officer, a real Russian military man. "I am proud that Russia is once again standing up fully as a country that has always influenced geo-politics and will continue in future....Ten years ago nobody thought about Russia but now they will have to deal with Russia." Mr Lugovoy is accompanied by bodyguards from his own security firm wherever he goes in public now. He said that he feared for his life if he travelled to London to answer the allegation against him, but he clearly also feels insecure in Moscow. He must be hoping that he can protect himself against whoever might be involved in Russia by making accusations so publicly against MI6 and Mr Berezovsky. It is a high-risk balancing act in a case that grows murkier with each new revelation. * Town / City Save to my times Madeleine police use psychic reports in hunt for girl Lugovoy revels in spotlight as Russia sezies on claims Claim by claim: Lugovoy's theories examined Fear and celebration greets Hariri tribunal vote by UN Hunt for Britons goes on amid Iraqi violence Woman dies after electricity cut off 'More tender than we could imagine' Where a spell of fame begins with a bee Charles Bremner's Paris weblog How to flatter, and how to offend, a Frenchwoman Footage of the young girl before her abduction Latest from Bronwen Maddox, Chief Foreign Commentator of The Times You can get beer for children now?

The quartet &#8212; Russia, the United States, the U.N. and the European Union &#8212; met Wednesday in Berlin and issued a statement urging "all Palestinians to immediately renounce all acts of violence and respect the cease-fire." It called on the Palestinian authority "to do everything necessary to restore law and order." It condemned the firing of rockets into southern Israel from Gaza and the buildup of arms by Hamas militants and "other terrorist groups" in Gaza. The four countries also called for the release of British Broadcasting Corp. journalist Alan Johnston, who was kidnapped in Gaza on March 12. Russian denies involvement in Litvinenko killing Bicycle programs catching on in major cities Europe leads in designing buildings that save energy The four Quartet diplomats &#8212; German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon &#8212; met at the Foreign Ministry in Berlin. The group has seen renewed activity in recent months, though violence has continued. They plan to meet again in June, this time with Arab representative in the Middle East. New violence in the region has further dimmed prospects for significant peace efforts. On Wednesday, Israel&#039;s Security Cabinet said it would continue its two-week-old campaign of airstrikes against cells of Hamas militants firing rockets across the Gaza border. Hamas&#039; supreme leader vowed the attacks on Israel would continue. The Quartet produced the stalled road map peace plan that was to culminate with statehood for the Palestinians. Germany, which holds the European Union and G-8 presidencies, has been keen to restore energy to the Quartet group, and it has held several meetings this year.

(Xinhua Photo) GAZA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli air and ground forces expanded Tuesday its crackdown operation against militants of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in the Gaza Strip. More ground forces of the Israeli army have been sent into Palestinian controlled territories in northern and southern Gaza Strip, leaving the door opened for more escalation of the conflict with Hamas militants. Palestinian security sources said that for the first time in two weeks, Israel sent a ground force backed by more than 20 tanks and armored vehicles into an area southeast Gaza Strip, killing two Hamas militants. Palestinian medics at Abu Yosef al-Najjar in the town of Rafah in southern Gaza Strip said that three more civilians were moderately injured, including a 32-year-old woman during the Israeli incursion. The area that was stormed was not far from the commercial crossing of Sofa, east of Rafah town on the borders between Gaza and Israel, where witnessed the kidnapping of Israeli corporal Gilad Shalit almost one year ago. Witnesses said that after the Israeli soldiers killed the two Hamas militants, they stormed into several houses and detained two brothers of one of the two militants. Tuesdays' incursion into Rafah area is the first ground operation since the beginning of the Israeli operation on Hamas militants who fire rockets at southern Israel on May 17, said the Palestinian security officials. Before that, Israel has been hitting Hamas targets from air, killing 48 Palestinians. At predawn on Tuesday, Israeli warplanes have not left the air of Gaza, where it had targeted a building belongs to Hamas movement in the town of Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza Strip, but no injuries were reported. Following a meeting of the Israeli cabinet held on Sunday, Israeli Premier Ehud Olmert vowed to expand military actions on Gaza militants, whether militants halt or continue rockets attacks on Israel. Meanwhile, Hamas movement's armed wing spokesman vowed that attacks on Israel would continue "as long as Israel continues its aggression on our people and the men of resistance."

Iran&#x2019;s chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani reiterated that he would not give in to demands that his country suspend uranium enrichment over fears it is developing nuclear weapons. Iran denies that it is secretly developing atom bombs. Larijani is due to hold talks today with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana amid a long-running argument between Iran and the west over the Islamic republic&#x2019;s nuclear programme. Diplomats do not expect a breakthrough. &#x201C;If Iran continues to ignore demands of the Security Council, we will support further appropriate measures as agreed in Resolution 1747,&#x201D; the Group of Eight (G-8) foreign ministers said in a statement issued at a meeting in Potsdam, Germany. The G-8 statement expressed &#x201C;deep regret that Iran, as we saw in the latest report by the director general (of the International Atomic Energy Agency), has continued to expand its enrichment activities&#x201D;. Security Council resolution 1747 gave Tehran a 60-day deadline to freeze all enrichment work. Iran ignored the deadline, which expired last week. The term &#x201C;appropriate measures&#x201D; is widely seen as diplomatic code for sanctions. The council has already imposed two rounds of sanctions on Iran for failing to suspend uranium enrichment. Besides major western powers and Japan, the G-8 also includes Russia, which has backed previous UN resolutions while stressing Iran&#x2019;s right to a peaceful nuclear programme. Today&#x2019;s meeting between Larijani and Solana, acting on behalf of world powers, will be the first since US and Iranian officials held rare face-to-face discussions in Iraq, although atomic affairs were not on the agenda in Baghdad. The US , which accuses Iran of seeking to build an atomic bomb, has been leading efforts to isolate it over its nuclear programme and also says it is stirring up violence in Iraq. Iran denies both charges. &#x201C;Suspension is not a solution to Iran&#x2019;s nuclear issue &#x2026; Iran cannot accept suspension,&#x201D; Larijani said in Tehran before leaving for Madrid, where he will meet Solana. &#x201C;We have no conditions and we are ready for constructive talks but we will not accept any preconditions.

Despite 27 nations not voting, the resolution urging Japan to suspend the "lethal aspects" of its scientific whaling programme was adopted 40-2 on Wednesday. The vote prompted a boycott by Japan and 26 other mostly pro-whaling nations making up more than one-third of the IWC. The non-binding resolution was proposed by and sponsored by other anti-whaling nations led by the at the annual talks in voted against it while 's conservation minister, said: "It was a clear division showing the different philosophical camps that are here in the IWC. "It will be bad enough if was just harpooning whales along its own shores, but actually it comes down and harpoons our whales," he said. Managing the world's whales International Whaling Commission (IWC) founded 1946 to regulate and protect whales, which had been hunted to the brink of extinction Blanket moratorium on commercial whaling introduced 1986 Three IWC members hunt whales in significant numbers: An exemption to the moratorium allows indigenous communities in places like Greenland and Significant policy changes such as lifting moratorium require a 75 per cent majority vote in IWC called the move a "hate" resolution. Glenn Inwood, the Japanese delegation spokesman, said: "We had a spirit of compromise at this meeting and the anti-whalers just can't help themselves but to pass hate resolutions." For the first time in IWC history, more than two dozen countries refused to participate in the vote, saying it was divisive and served no purpose, officials said. It underscored the increasing division within the 75-member IWC, which has nearly an equal number of pro- and anti-whaling nations, making it difficult for policy changes in the commission that require a three-fourths majority. Eugene Lapointe, president of the International Wildlife Management Consortium World Conservation Trust, a pro-sustainable use group, said: "It was the wrong resolution, at the wrong time and delivered in the wrong tone. "It has further undermined the relevance of the IWC." The IWC, which manages whaling and is in charge of conservation of the creatures, had imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling since 1986 but , according to environmentalists, is exploiting a legal loophole allowing whaling for scientific research. kills about 1,000 whales a year under its scientific programme then sells the meat. Japanese whaling fleets head for the Southern Ocean every summer. "I just think that the Japanese have been very selfish and going against the views of the people of the southern hemisphere," Carter said. Japan kills about 1,000 whales a year under its scientific programme [ICR] last year won a non-binding resolution in favour of commercial whaling, but fell short of the numbers needed to overturn the two-decade moratorium. This year, the anti-whaling group has a narrow majority. made a formal bid at the IWC to overturn the moratorium even though it is expected to fail and worsen a split in the group. Joji Morishita, senior Japanese delegate, argued that the moratorium had to be lifted to allow 's traditional coastal communities to conduct whale hunts. He said they had the same fundamental right to pursue whaling as natives in the , submitting the proposal under the same IWC rules allowing aboriginal subsistence whaling quotas. were against the Japanese proposal, to be decided on Thursday, the final day of the four-day talks.

Due to China¡¯s protest, North.. Golden Buddha Stolen From Hae.. Signs of Clash Over Rice Loan? Things Were OK Until Today¡¦ By Park Hyun Min The third day of the 21st Inter-Korea Cabinet Talks may see North Korea making a proposal regarding the ¡°400,000tons of rice¡± to South Korea. From 2.30PM on the 30th, the North¡¯s chief delegate spent about 30 minutes requesting South Korea to ¡°deliver on its promises on the rice loan.¡± The overall analysis is that North Korea was reconnoitering the scene before it made any concrete requests. Public information officer for the Unification Ministry Kim Nam Shik said, ¡°The keynote address that was made by both parties had underlying comments to dwell upon¡± and revealed, ¡°Nothing has been agreed as yet. Rather we must discuss these matters through the executive meetings.¡± However, at the official dinner held on the evening of 30th at Walker Hill Hotel, there are signs to suggest that Unification Minister Lee Jae Jung and North Korea¡¯s Cabinet Secretary Kwon Ho Woong may have had a clash over the issue of the rice loan to be discussed on the 31st. At this gathering, Secretary Kwon said slurring his sentence, ¡°The visit was pleasant, the meals and even until today, everything was good¡¦ but,¡± then, Minister Lee responded holding Kwon¡¯s hands, ¡°It doesn't end today. Just as today was good, tomorrow will be good¡¦¡± ¡°It would be perfect if the day after tomorrow is good and good for forevermore¡¦¡± Minister Kwon said reverberating his words. Meanwhile from within the talks, others proposed, ¡°For two days North Korea has been eyeing South Korea¡¯s maneuvers and has not yet officially sought the issue of rice. This may be a planned strategy to propose the rice loan issue at the end of the talks.¡± At the 13th Inter-Korean Economic Cooperation Promotion Committee in April, the South Korean government agreed to loan North Korea food aid and send the first lot of rice by the end of May. However, as North Korea¡¯s implementation of the February 13 Agreement was delayed, the rice loan became linked to the matter which resulted in reserving the rice loan. If North Korea strongly requests for the rice loan, it seems that the South Korean government will use a defense in convincing North Korea that the settlement made would go ahead as normal and that the rice was merely delayed. As Minister Lee asserts, its not that the rice ¡°will not be given, not cannot be given,¡± its merely that the situation is being postponed. If the rice issue is resolved smoothly, the South Korean government plans to dive into the Inter-Korea joint meeting of national policy research institutions, the Ministers¡¯ meeting between South¡¯s and North¡¯s National Defense Ministry and economic cooperative negotiation which were proposed at the 1st General Meeting by the South. The most critical argument the South Korean government has opted to take is a ¡°peace¡± and ¡°one national economy.¡± While South Korea strives for a ¡°peace¡± and North Korea ¡°economic cooperation,¡± it seems that the South Korean government is trying kill two birds with one stone. Further as the normalization of U.S.-North Korea relations and Japan-North Korea relations working groups of the six party talks continues to make progress, some calculate that the working groups revolving the two Korea¡¯s will also heed to this pace. Since North Korea¡¯s speech at the June 15th Summit Talks in 2000, the two countries have been making steady progress. Additionally, North Korea stated that foreign pressures had to be eliminated from the issue of one nation and that the remaining remnants of the Cold War also had to be removed. North Korea raised the question on the ¡°Reception Staging Onward Movement and Integration¡± and ¡°abrogation of National Safety Law,¡± which have been mentioned since the 17th Inter-Korea Talks in 2005. However, at this current stage, many argue that rather than anticipating any immediate measures, continuous efforts and talks would be more profitable. Signs of Clash Over Rice Loan?

The U.S.-based International Society for Iranian Studies has urged Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to release jailed scholars Haleh Esfandiari and Kian Tajbakhsh. It also expresses concerns about possible torture of the scholars by their Iranian jailers to force them to make confessions. Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the International Federation of Human Rights, Reporters Without Borders, and Iranian Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi also are calling on Tehran to release the scholars immediately. Those groups also are urging Tehran to lift travel bans on two journalists with dual-citizenship -- Parnaz Azima, a U.S.-Iranian correspondent for U.S.-government funded Radio Farda,Â  and Mehrnoush Solouki, a French-Iranian journalism student. Ebadi, whose work for democracy and women and children's rights made her the first-ever Iranian recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, accused Iran's judiciary of "denying dual-nationals their basic rights" and disregarding "Iran's laws as well as international norms." Ebadi and her Defenders of Human Rights Center are working on behalf of two of the defendants. The groups also are seeking information about Ali Shakeri, an Iranian-American peace activist who went missing during a visit to Iran. The groups say Shakeri is thought to have been jailed by Iranian authorities. All of the groups accuse Tehran of trying to spread fear among journalists, writers, scholars, and activists. Iran: Concern Grows For Detained Iranian-Americans Washington Rejects Iranian Allegations Of Spying Iran Announces Charges Against Three U.S.-Iranian Nationals Iran Says U.S. Must Change Policy In Iraq Bush Calls For Tougher Sanctions On Iran U.S.-Iranian Talks In Baghdad Some perspectives on the U.S.-Iranian talks of May 28, 2007, as expressed to Radio Farda. Mehrdad Khansari, a former Iranian diplomat and analyst who is based in London: "Today the talks with the U.S. have begun but that does not mean that the talks will have reached a result. The Iranian and U.S. governments need to [tell] their audiences that they are not abstaining from talking to each other." Tehran-based journalist Mashaollah Shamsolvaezin (pictured above): "There is a necessity that has forced the two countries to accept a series of new issues; these new issues are the talks that are going to begin between the two sides and I am hopeful about its future. The U.S. is facing serious [problems] regarding the situation in Iraq, from the other side is Iran facing some threats in the Middle East that come from insecurity in Iraq and also insecurity in Afghanistan. The seriousness of talks depend on the will of both sides and it seems that both sides are determined to seriously deal with issues, therefore I see a positive perspective for the Iran/U.S.talks." Ted Galen Carpenter, a U.S. foreign policy analyst at the Cato Institute in Washington (pictured above), says he believesÂ the talksÂ can help: "The United States is in a difficult position right now in that the current U.S policy in Iraq simply has not worked at all; and I think we are beginning to cast about for some alternatives and Iran can be at least modestly hopeful in that regard as long as we recognize that Iranian influence in Iraq is going to be inevitably much, much stronger than it was before." Richard Perle, a former Pentagon official (pictured above) who lobbied forcefully for a U.S. invasion of Iraq: "I don't believe [talking to Iran will] help because I don't believe there is any interest on the part of the mullahs in Tehran in changing the behavior of the government of Iran, which has been -- and I think will continue to be -- to encourage violence and disorder in Iraq."

At table is IWC chair Bill Hogarth. (AP Photo/Michael Dinneen) ANCHORAGE, Alaska - Japan said Wednesday that the International Whaling Commission should allow four of its coastal communities to hunt minke whales because the tradition is so old that it qualifies as subsistence hunting. Japan's proposal at the annual meeting of the 77-nation commission started a long and contentious debate Wednesday, a day after the body allowed Alaska Natives to continue the subsistence hunts of bowhead whales through 2012. The issue is scheduled to be decided Thursday, the final day of the meeting. Joji Morishita, the alternate IWC commissioner for Japan, told delegates that the Japanese communities "have been living on this tradition for hundreds of years; it is part of their lives." Morishita said science cannot draw the line between small coastal whaling and aboriginal whaling. Japan for more than two decades has sought "community whaling" status, which would give it quotas similar to those allowing Alaska Natives and other indigenous groups to hunt the mammals. Japan already kills about a 1,000 whales a year and sells the meat under a scientific research provision allowed by the whaling commission, which enacted a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. The proposal was heard a day after the whaling commission allowed Alaska Natives to continue the subsistence hunts of bowhead whales through 2012. Morishita acknowledged Wednesday that if Japan's request is approved, some meat from the minke whales, a relatively small species, would be sold. "What's wrong with commerciality?" he said. "Even the media here is commercial. Why do people have to see only commercial whaling as evil?" Russia supports the proposal, with its delegation saying Japan's traditional whaling is likely twice as old as Arctic whaling. That contention is misleading, said Atsushi Ishii, an environmental studies professor at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan. Of the four communities, he said, only Taiji on the southeastern coast has a tradition of hunting right whales , now under the commission moratorium , dating back more than 100 years. Only later, around the World War II era, did the other three begin hunting species now banned, he said. However, a number of nations voiced strong opposition. New Zealand said the minke proposal is the type of commercial whaling banned by the 1986 ban. The U.S. delegation noted that 360 minke whales are already caught annually in the Sea of Japan and the North Pacific. Of that, 220 are for Japan's scientific research program and 140 are bycatch. Both the United States and New Zealand also have expressed outrage at Japan's plan to kill 50 humpback whales, an endangered species, as part of its science program. The two were among nations to successfully pass a symbolic resolution Wednesday calling for Japan to suspend all lethal aspects of the program conducted within the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, an area around Antarctica where commercial whaling is banned. Also Wednesday, Greenland failed to win consensus on a revised proposal to increase its aboriginal quota of minke whales. Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory, originally wanted to add bowhead and humpback whales to its hunt for the first time. Critics said the giant mammals have low reproduction cycles and should not be treated as menu items.

The Quartet, which includes Russia, the United States, the United Nations and the EU, urged an end to fighting Wednesday between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, calling on the Palestinian government to do everything necessary to restore law and order. The group, which met in Berlin, also urged all Palestinians to immediately renounce all acts of violence and respect the cease-fire. Alaa el-Hadidy, a spokesman for Egypt's foreign ministry, described the Quartet's statement Thursday as unbalanced. "This is tantamount to giving a green light to Israel to continue its operations in the Palestinian territories," el-Hadidy said in a statement. "The credibility of the Quartet, as a neutral side, is now at stake." A five-month truce in Gaza unraveled earlier this month when Hamas began firing barrages of rockets into southern Israel, prompting Israel to respond with a series of air strikes. More than 50 Palestinians, most of them militants, and two Israeli civilians have been killed. The four countries also called for the release of British Broadcasting Corp. journalist Alan Johnston, who was kidnapped in Gaza on March 12. "How come the Quartet demands the immediate release of an Israeli soldier and does not condemn the kidnapping of the Palestinian lawmakers?" el-Hadidy said. Israel has arrested dozens of senior Hamas officials, including lawmakers and government ministers, as part of the recent crackdown. The group has seen renewed activity in recent months, though violence has continued. They plan to meet again in June, this time with Arab representatives in the Middle East. The Quartet produced the stalled road map peace plan that was to culminate with statehood for the Palestinians.
