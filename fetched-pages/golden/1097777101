They said the blueprint was tentatively due to be published on June 4, two days before President Hu Jintao attends a meeting of Group of Eight leaders in Germany at which global warming will be high on the agenda. The officials, briefing reporters on condition they not be identified, staunchly defended China&#x2019;s record in tackling climate change. But they reaffirmed Beijing&#x2019;s rejection of compulsory caps on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that scientists say are heating the planet. &#x201C;A mandatory quota for China now would not be fair and therefore China cannot accept that,&#x201D; said one official who helps direct Beijing&#x2019;s climate change policy. China looks set to become the world&#x2019;s top emitter of carbon dioxide this year or next, just as serious talks start to extend the UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol on global warming beyond 2012. German Chancellor Angela Merkel hopes the G8 summit, in the Baltic resort of Heiligendamm, will pave the way for an extension of the protocol by agreeing on concrete steps to tackle emissions. China&#x2019;s objection to mandatory caps, which is shared by the US, underscores the difficulty she faces. Beijing argues that rich nations pumped out most of the carbon dioxide already accumulated in the atmosphere and so they should cut their own emissions rather than push poorer nations to accept caps that could constrict their growth. &#x201C;Developed countries are to blame for climate change, but resolving this issue needs cooperation among all countries based upon on their different responsibilities, their capacity and their level of economic development,&#x201D; a second official said. China&#x2019;s emissions per capita of its 1,3 billion population are only one-fifth as high as America&#x2019;s, officials said. What&#x2019;s more, they said, between 1991 and 2005 China reduced the amount of energy used to produce each unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by 47% &#x2014; a conclusion corroborated by the Paris-based International Energy Agency. &#x201C;This cannot be matched by any other country during this period, including the European Union,&#x201D; the first official said. Since 2003, however, this measure of &#x201C;energy intensity&#x201D; has rebounded, and China has been fighting to restore the downtrend. A strong government campaign produced a 1% reduction in 2006 and China is sticking to its target of cutting 2005 levels by 20% by 2010. &#x201C;This goal is quite high, but we have the capability to reach it,&#x201D; he said. Among other steps, China aims to increase the proportion of energy produced from renewable sources, such as hydro and solar power, to 10% of the total by 2010. The officials gave no details of the content of the climate change plan, but sources who saw an earlier draft said China&#x2019;s political leaders appeared wary of making commitments they might not be able to keep. While an internal assessment of the risks to China from global warming proposed the country&#x2019;s first targets to curb emissions growth &#x2014; in the form of a target for &#x201C;carbon intensity&#x201D; &#x2014; officials told Reuters last month that the national plan probably would not include concrete targets. Under the carbon intensity target, which is less demanding than a goal for an outright cut in greenhouse gases, China would reduce its emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide per unit of GDP by 40% from 2000 to 2020. The G8 summit will also focus on fostering growth in Africa and global economic cooperation. The main members of the club - the US, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Russia - have invited China, India, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico to an &#x201C;outreach session&#x201D;. India, one of the world&#x2019;s top-five greenhouse gas emitters, also opposes binding emissions targets. It says global warming is the fault of industrialised nations, which should commit to deep emissions cuts first rather than pressuring developing countries. Asked whether China risked being labelled &#x201C;Mr No&#x201D; for its opposition to emission caps and a refusal to let the yuan rise more quickly, a third official said Hu would work to tackle global challenges, including economic imbalances. &#x201C;China won&#x2019;t be a Mr No. We want to be a Mr Cooperation and Mr Partnership,&#x201D; he said.

Robert Zoellick is a veteran of Washington's and Wall Street's top levels. As a US government official, he helped negotiate the reunification of Germany in 1990 and later smoothed China's entry into the World Trade Organization. More recently, he's brokered business deals throughout Asia as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs. But now he's in line for a job that might be the toughest of his career: head of the World Bank. He'll have to heal rifts opened by the ouster of current bank president Paul Wolfowitz, while tackling the crucial issue of poverty in the world's poorest countries. And he'll be working in a truly international institution â€“ an environment perhaps like none he's experienced before. "The World Bank poses a management challenge. This isn't like managing a private company," says Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. "The staff does not work for you. You can have the best ideas, and if you can't get them executed, it doesn't accomplish anything." Mr. Wolfowitz is stepping down in the wake of findings by a special bank panel that he violated bank rules in arranging a transfer and salary increase in 2005 for his companion, Shaha Riza, a bank employee. Controversy over Wolfowitz divided bank employees and strained US relations with European nations, which favored his ouster. At a White House ceremony Wednesday announcing his nomination, Mr. Zoellick acknowledged the bank's recent difficulties. "For all involved there are frustrations, anxieties, and tensions that could inhibit the future," Zoellick said. "This is understandable but not without remedy." The bank needs to get past this discord, he added. "I believe the World Bank's best days are still to come," he said. Zoellick's nomination must still be approved by the bank's 24-member board of directors. However, according to an informal tradition observed since the founding of the world's current international financial organizations in the wake of World War II, the United States chooses the head of the World Bank, while Europeans pick the leader of the International Monetary Fund. Some experts had hoped that following Wolfowitz's problems, the US would opt to change this method of governance and open up the World Bank selection process â€“ perhaps by submitting a list of candidates from which the bank board could pick.

http://www.greeleytrib.com/article/20070531/NEWS/70531002&cid The Tribune - News You Pick The News Hurricane forecast remains same FORT COLLINS — Colorado State University hurricane forecasters today maintained an earlier forecast that called for a very active 2007 season with a 74 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the U.S. coastline. The hurricane forecast team is calling for 17 named storms forming in the Atlantic basin June 1-Nov. 30. Nine of the storms are expected to become hurricanes with five becoming intense hurricanes with sustained winds of 111 mph or greater. The entire report is available on the Web at No hurricanes made landfall along the U.S. coastline in 2006. The 2006 season witnessed a total of 10 named storms, five hurricanes and two major hurricanes. Long-term averages are 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes per year. "We expect an above-average hurricane season with ENSO conditions on the cool side, which will help increase the likelihood of major storm activity in the Atlantic," said Phil Klotzbach of the Colorado State hurricane forecast team and the lead author of the forecast. "El Nino conditions during the summer and fall - similar to those that developed in 2006 - tend to decrease Atlantic hurricane activity by increasing vertical wind shear across the area where Atlantic tropical cyclones develop." The hurricane forecast team predicts tropical cyclone activity in 2007 will be 185 percent of the average season. By comparison, 2005 witnessed tropical cyclone activity that was about 275 percent of the average season.

Apologies to Indonesia anger Balibo families Governor of Jakarta Sutiyoso and Australian Ambassador for Indonesia Bill Farmer talk to the press following a meeting in Jakarta. Dark past behind a would-be president Should Australia apologise to Indonesia over the Balibi inquiry? Apology helps avert crisis Brendan Nicholson and Mark Forbes A POWERFUL Indonesian politician at the centre of a diplomatic stoush with Canberra has received personal apologies from the Australian ambassador and NSW Premier Morris Iemma, apparently defusing the row. Ambassador Bill Farmer visited Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso at his office yesterday to express "deep sympathy" over an incident involving the governor in Sydney this week. Mr Iemma, whose Government hosted the governor in NSW, also wrote to him late yesterday apologising for "distress and inconvenience caused" during his stay. Governor Sutiyoso, a prospective Indonesian presidential candidate, stormed out of Australia on Tuesday after he was confronted by NSW police at his hotel and asked to testify at the inquest into the 1975 Balibo incident in East Timor. The governor claimed police barged unannounced into his room at the Shangri-La Hotel while he was resting. But a relative of one of the five Australian newsmen killed as Indonesian troops invaded East Timor in 1975 last night expressed his disgust at the apologies. "The families have been waiting for 32 years for an apology for what is now recognised as an international war crime," said John Milkins, the son of Channel Seven cameraman Gary Cunningham. "Now we have the same excuse that saw them murdered in the first place: the national interest. "Are we going to let justice and the Geneva Convention be thrown out in favour of gutless toadying to Indonesian Government pressure? &#133; The coroner and an individual police officer are being hung out to dry by the federal and state governments." One of the two officers involved, Detective Sergeant Steve Thomas, is now on leave and the subject of an inquiry. The police were sent to the hotel by Deputy NSW Coroner Dorelle Pinch after she learned the governor of Jakarta was in Sydney and decided she would seek his testimony at the inquest into the death of Brian Peters, one of the newsmen killed in East Timor. Governor Sutiyoso was the deputy commander of a special forces unit during the 1975 invasion but has denied any connection to the deaths. His story about the hotel intrusion was backed yesterday by a hotel employee, who said police ordered a senior staff member to use a master key to gain entry. "They demanded access to the guest room," the employee told Mr Iemma, in his letter of apology, said he had been advised there was a breakdown in communications between state agencies. "I apologise for the distress and inconvenience caused and regret your early departure from NSW," he wrote. As anti-Australian protesters gathered outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta for the second day, Mr Farmer visited Governor Sutiyoso at Jakarta's city hall to apologise. Governor Sutiyoso said later he had forgiven Mr Farmer. "Before me and my staff he has extended an apology, his shock and his disappointment," he said. "We are a big-hearted nation. If they have extended an apology, we should not do things that are beyond the limit. We should repair the relationship." Foreign Minister Alexander Downer phoned his Indonesian counterpart, Hassan Wirajuda, to tell him an investigation was under way. He said the Jakarta Governor was "of course, outraged" after the police officers walked into his room. "Australians have to understand the concept of humiliation in Indonesia," Mr Downer said. "As the Indonesians would see it, this is an enormous humiliation for a major Indonesian figure." In Jakarta, Foreign Ministry head Imron Cotan said he believed the issue would be overcome by the apologies. But he expressed concern over reports that the Sydney coronial inquiry could recommend that two former Indonesian army officers face war crimes charges. The hotel incident received front-page coverage in Jakarta, with several newspapers suggesting the governor was the victim of a conspiracy. While the apologies appeared to defuse the diplomatic row, they sparked anger among critics of Australian policies towards Indonesia. Academic Damien Kingsbury said Australia had a history of placating Jakarta. "If we were a bit more frank in the first instance, we wouldn't then have these kind of problems," said Dr Kingsbury, an associate professor at Deakin University. Businessman Ian Melrose, who has financed advertisements about Indonesia's human rights record in East Timor and West Papua, said: "Five Australian journalists are killed and we apologise to the Indonesian Government.

Russian denies involvement in Litvinenko killing Published: May 31, 2007 The Russian businessman Britain has accused of murdering a former KGB agent, Alexander Litvinenko, denied involvement Thursday, saying that British intelligence agents, the Mafia and a self-exiled Russian multimillionaire were more likely suspects. In the latest twist to a murder case that has revived memories of the Cold War and strained British-Russian relations, the suspect, Andrei Lugovoi, sought to parry the accusations against him. "Britain is making me a scapegoat," Lugovoi, a former KGB bodyguard, said at a news conference in Moscow that was broadcast live on state television. He said that he did not know for certain who had killed Litvinenko with radioactive polonium in London last November, but that he could think of three possible suspects: British intelligence, the Mafia and Boris Berezovsky, a multimillionaire who fled Russia for Britain after repeated criticism of President Vladimir Putin and open admissions that he hoped to fund a political revolution in Russia. Lugovoi accused both Litvinenko and Berezovsky of working for British spy agencies and he charged that the murder was linked to such activity. Russian denies involvement in Litvinenko killing Bicycle programs catching on in major cities Europe leads in designing buildings that save energy Asked whether he had firm proof of British intelligence involvement in the murder, Lugovoi replied "Yes." He offered no details. Lugovoi knew Litvinenko for several years and both worked in the 1990s in Moscow for Berezovsky. Britain said Thursday that its request for Lugovoi&#039;s extradition, which Moscow said it cannot honor, had nothing to do with British intelligence. "This is a criminal matter and is not an issue about intelligence," a Foreign Office spokesman said. "A British citizen was killed in London and U.K. citizens and visitors were put at risk." Berezovsky was not available for comment. Litvinenko, a former Russian Federal Security Service officer who obtained British citizenship, said in a statement made public after he died that Putin was behind his poisoning. The Kremlin has described that charge as nonsense and has accused its opponents living abroad of using the case to damage Russia&#039;s image.

Suspect Blames British For Spy's Death Litvinenko Died Of Poisoning By Rare Radioactive Isotope POSTED: 2:49 am PDT May 31, 2007 The Russian businessman whom Britain has named as a suspect in the killing of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko said Thursday that he has evidence of British special services' involvement in the poisoning death. "Even if (British special services) hadn't done it itself, it was done under its control or connivance," Andrei Lugovoi told a news conference. Asked if he had evidence for the allegation, he said "I have evidence" but did not elaborate. A British government security official, who demanded anonymity in exchange for discussing Lugovoi's claims because of the sensitivity of the case, said suggestions British intelligence had involvement in Litvinenko's death were spurious. Britain last week said it had enough evidence to charge Lugovoi, who also worked for the KGB and its main successor agency the FSB, in the November killing of Litvinenko. Litvinenko, who died of poisoning by the rare radioactive isotope polonium-210, had fled to Britain several years earlier after becoming a strong critic of the Kremlin and received British citizenship. Lugovoi and another Russian had met in London with Litvinenko on Nov. 1, the day Litvinenko said he became ill. Britain has requested Lugovoi's extradition, but Russia has refused, saying the constitution does not permit such extraditions. Lugovoi has repeatedly asserted he is not guilty in the matter. On Thursday, Lugovoi also claimed that Britain had tried to recruit him to provide intelligence. British special services "asked me to collect compromising information on President (Vladimir) Putin," Lugovoi said. Lugovoi said the attempted recruitment occurred during business trips to Britain in previous years. He did not give a precise date, but indicated the alleged approach occurred in late 2005 or early 2006. London's Foreign Office, responsible for the country's overseas secret intelligence service MI6, declined to comment on Lugovoi's claim. But another government official with knowledge of Lugovoi, who also demanded anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, said the allegations were untrue. . All rights reserved.

In a clear reference to the United States, he harshly criticised "dictate and imperialism" in global affairs and warned that Russia will strengthen its military potential to maintain a global strategic balance. "It wasn&#039;t us who initiated a new round of arms race," Putin said when asked about this week&#039;s missile tests at a news conference after talks with Greek President Karolos Papoulias.

Get the lowdown on all the latest releases in the pages of our Today section Thursday, 31 May, 2007 Place a Classified Ad Top 5 on Web FOR SALE: Quads Easter Poster Drive -- Spring Edition Mike Harris used racist slur: Ipperwash report Thu, May 31, 2007 Also finds former Ontario premier did not interfere in park occupation The head of the Ipperwash inquiry has ruled that former premier Mike Harris told a high-level meeting on the day Dudley George was killed that "I want the f---ing Indians out of the park." But Justice Sidney Linden also found that while Harris's comment was "racist" and the premier was critical of police, Harris did not interfere or give inappropriate directions to the police at Ipperwash. "Although one may disagree with his views, it was legitimate for the Premier to take the position that the First Nations people were illegally occupying the park, and that he wanted them out of Ipperwash Park as soon as possible." Harris had denied he made such a remark during his testimony at the inquiry, but Linden wrote that after carefully reviewing the evidence he believed Harris said it. Linden, who had been urged by the police union to find that Dudley George was armed with a gun when he was shot, found that Dudley George did not have a gun on the night he was killed by Acting OPP Sgt. Ken Deane. "Ken Deane's assertion that Dudley threw his rifle on the ground is implausible," wrote Linden. "I accept the evidence of the aboriginal people that the occupiers did not have guns at the park during the confrontation with police." Four years in the making, the 1,500-page report of the judicial inquiry into the police shooting of native protester Dudley George on Sept. 6, 1995 contains 98 recommendations, covering future police operations and federal and provincial government relations with natives. George was part of a group of natives who had moved into the park after it was closed for the season, claiming it was the site of a native burial ground, an assertion that was later confirmed by the federal government. Based on recorded conversations and radio transmissions, Linden found that the racism and cultural insensitivity among some members of the Ontario Provincial Police contributed to the lack of a timely, peaceful resolution to the Ipperwash occupation. "There is no place for racial taunts or slurs of any type by police officers," Linden wrote. Police who were ordered to the park on the night of Sept. 6, 1995 were acting on mistaken and unverified information, the report said. "The OPP's assessment of the risk at the park was incorrect. This mistake had severe and tragic repercussions." In the early part of the native occupation, the police commander and other officers spent an inordinate amount of time and effort on armoured vehicles, weapons and other equipment, valuable time taken away from important issues such as speaking to a negotiator, Linden wrote. The report calls for the OPP to ensure the involvement of First Nation police services and mediators when it responds to future aboriginal occupations and protests. Linden also calls for the OPP to issue a public apology to Cecil Bernard George for the blows to his head and face at the hands of one or more unidentified police officers when he was arrested in the sandy parking where Dudley George was shot. A Kettle Point band councillor, Cecil Bernard George hadn't been part of the occupation, but was arrested during the clash between natives and police. "The apology should be delivered in person by the current Commissioner, or his delegate, and via a press release and conference," Linden said. In a blunt recommendation, Linden calls for the federal government to immediately return the former army camp to the peoples of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation and guarantee it will assume complete responsibility for an appropriate environmental clean-up of the site. "The federal government should issue a public apology with appropriate compensation to the Kettle and Stony Point First Nation for the failure of the federal government for more than 60 years to honour its promise to return the lands to the First Nation." Linden also recommends the creation of a permanent, independent and impartial agency, the Treaty Commission of Ontario, to oversee the settling of native land claims in Ontario. "The single biggest source of frustration, distrust, and ill-feeling among aboriginal people in Ontario is our failure to deal in a just and expeditious way with breaches of treaty and other legal obligations to First Nations. If the governments of Ontario and Canada want to avoid future confrontations like Ipperwash or Caledonia, they will have to deal with land and treaty claims effectively and fairly," the report said. In his report, Linden refers to "missed opportunities" during the Ipperwash crisis by government officials, including the burial-ground issue raised by the native protesters. "Had more effort been exerted, had more concern been attached by political staff and civil servants to this issue, and had there been due diligence, government officials would have realized that documents stored for decades in the basement of the Whitney Block showed that the First Nations people had voiced their concerns about these burial grounds," the report notes. As for the future of Ipperwash Provincial Park, which still remains occupied by the natives, Linden said allowing the status quo to continue "is not in anybody's interest." "It is a tribute to the patience and restraint of the occupiers and the local residents that there have been no serious, adverse incidents since 1995. But this unresolved status should not continue," the report said. But Linden wrote there are no perfect solutions and it wouldn't be acceptable if the park were re-opened unilaterally by the Ontario government as a provincial park. One possiblity, he suggests, is a co-management arrangement with the native community that would see the park operated by the aboriginals for the benefit of all Ontarians and visitors. Other recommendations of the inquiry include: - Public education about treaties to improve relations. "At the very least, every Ontarian should understand that this province and our country were built upon the treaties negotiated with our First Nations, and that everyone shares the benefits and obligations of those treaties. Every Ontarian should also realize that treaties are not historical artifacts from some distant past. They remain vitally important and relevant today." - Ontario should create a Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs to administer and support a revitalized land claims process.

Chance of a challenge to Bush's man Bob Zoellick: The world in his hands. US PRESIDENT George Bush's nominee as head of the World Bank, Bob Zoellick, is virtually certain to be ratified by the bank's board after June 15. But developing nations could nominate a candidate as a protest against the convention that gives the US the right to name the bank's head. President Bush said Mr Zoellick had a distinguished career in diplomacy and development economics. "He's a committed internationalist," he said. "He is deeply devoted to the mission of the World Bank. He wants to help struggling nations defeat poverty, to grow their economics and offer their people the hope of a better life." The World Bank board said it welcomed the nomination of Mr Zoellick, a former diplomat and economist, who has served as US deputy secretary of state, and former special trade representative in the Bush Administration. But it reiterated its stance that nominations were open until June 15 and board meetings would be held to consider all nominations. This leaves open the possibility of a repeat of events at the International Monetary Fund in 2004 when a group of developing nations put forward another candidate against the European nominee, Rodrigo de Rato. The move would be little more than a protest because Germany, which led the charge for the removal of the former president Paul Wolfowitz, is believed to have indicated that Mr Zoellick would be acceptable. In Canberra, Treasurer Peter Costello said Mr Zoellick would be "an excellent candidate". The French Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner, also backed the appointment. "Mr Zoellick is certainly the right man for the job," he said. But he said Mr Zoellick would need to regain the trust of the international community following the Wolfowitz scandal. The World Bank has been paralysed by controversy over Mr Wolfowitz's handling of a pay package for his girlfriend. But long before that, Mr Wolfowitz was seen as a controversial character, particularly by the European representatives on the bank because of his role in driving the Iraq war policies of the Bush Administration. Even this week, Mr Bush was still backing Mr Wolfowitz, describing him as "an able public servant" and "a man of character and integrity". But in the bank, Mr Wolfowitz proved a divisive figure &#151; he had strong views about fighting corruption by suspending loans to countries without transparent banking systems &#151; and morale among the 10,000 staff is said to be low. Mr Zoellick promised to tackle that issue: "We need to put yesterday's discord behind us and to focus on the future together," he said. Although Mr Zeollick is also a Bush Administration insider, he also enjoys a strong reputation as a capable and intelligent diplomat. He was instrumental as US trade representative in establishing the Doha Round of trade talks, and has been a strong advocate of free trade agreements, including the US-Australia agreement. Mr Zoellick has also been involved in diplomatic efforts in the Darfur region of Africa and other initiatives to fight poverty, something President Bush was keen to highlight. "Bob has had a strong voice for Africa," he said. "He wants to help struggling nations defeat poverty to grow their economies and offer their people the hope of better life." But not all are flattering about Mr Zoellick, with his critics pointing to some personal failings, particularly a propensity to tirades and a strong view on almost everything. Mr Zoellick's penchant to lecture, point by point, with little concern for editorial compression, is said to have irritated his boss, Condoleezza Rice, in the State Department, even though she had a huge regard for his intellect.

The latest deaths bring US casualties for the month to 119, the most since November 2004 when marines launched a full-scale invasion to retake the city of Fallujah in the volatile western Anbar province. April was also bloody for the US-led coalition, with 104 deaths. Taken together, the two past months have been the deadliest since the March 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. The news will increase pressure on US President George W. Bush, who has already seen domestic support for his war strategy fall to an all-time low and is facing calls to set a timetable for troops' withdrawal. Meanwhile, the hunt intensified for five Britons who were snatched at gunpoint from a finance ministry building in the capital earlier this week, in an abduction that has been blamed on Baghdad's Shi'ite militias.

Yaþar Büyükanýt said a military operation in northern Iraq is necessary and they wait for a relevant decision to be made by political mechanism. While the heaviest military build-up of recent years goes on in the Iraq border in eastern Turkey, preparations for a possible operation were launched. The retired general at a key post to provide cooperation and communication between Turkey and the U.S. regarding the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party's (PKK) terror, removed from office by the government. Last week's suicide bombing in Ankara and confessions of terrorists caught in numerous cities in this process strengthened the conviction that the PKK targets big cities. The violation of Turkish airspace last week by two U.S. F 16s created the impression that the government and armed forces are at odds. And finally, Kurdish administrators in northern Iraq made statements in the meaning “Turkish tanks cannot find way to these lands.” Operation by press releases?: Undoubtedly the key issue needs to be clarified here is the situation that produces reservations about politics-military relations and confuses the minds. By all means, neither from the military nor the politics perspective sharing thoughts about an imaginary military operation through press releases is normal. It is even needless to say that this is against the traditions of Turkish Army and the general principles of military professional. And only to know this requires a deduction that something is odd, there is something unusual. If you ask, what is “unusual”, my answer would be: The U.S. factor&#8230; Let me elaborate this a bit more: In the good old days, “Army to Iraq” meant a “hot pursue” or a “cross border operation”. And in legal perspective, all military operations before the U.S. invasion in Iraq were held by the approval of Baghdad and in the frame of mutual agreement with the neighboring country. But now, the situation has changed. Neither the approval of Baghdad nor of Washington is the point at issue. To the opposite, statements made by both capitals give the impression of an objection and even an implicit/explicit threat against Turkey. Therefore regardless of the decision by political body in Ankara depends on the ground of “terror” it will blatantly have the characteristic of a “declaration of war”. Intervention at all odds?: Let me get to the point. I am of the opinion that the public impression of a communication break down between the military and the politics stems from that the Turkish army will be facing the U.S. forces in northern Iraq. Because the presence of Kurdish peshmerga in northern Iraq does not justify who the dominant power is in the region. Therefore it is reasonable to explain the limped communication between the Turkish Armed Forces and the government by the desire to reach a prompt conclusion in the diplomatic initiatives with Washington. Observation of escalating desire “intervention at all odds” in the Turkish army might strengthen the hands of foreign affairs having hard time to express itself in Washington. But if you ask the question whether the army will enter Iraq, the answer of course will be it is possible if suicide bombings similar to the one in Ankara continue. Apparently as long as the investigation about the suicide attack of Anafartalar Avenue in Ankara is in progress, opportunities will rise to make some new assessments beyond clarifying the incident as an attack by the PKK. I previously mentioned that there are some groups in Washington making calculations to provoke Turkish military and dragging it into the quagmire in Iraq. And the military will be worn out in a “nightmare period”, civilian decision making mechanism will be strengthened etc&#8230; I hope we will not end up loses because of the incertitude originates from election and politics discussions. The realm of the state cannot afford the games of “pretends”&#8230; &copy; 2005 Dogan Daily News Inc.

Last month, 102 U.S. service members were killed in action, making April and May the deadliest two-month period for the American military since the March 2003 invasion. The highest number of deaths in a single month was 135 service members killed in action in November 2004, when Marines fought the battle for Fallujah. Four U.S. soldiers were killed in two separate roadside bomb attacks yesterday. A soldier seriously wounded in a May 28 roadside bomb attack died of his wounds a day later. A sixth soldier died from a non-combat related cause on May 29. The military detailed the deaths in separate e-mailed statements yesterday and today. U.S. deaths in Iraq have risen each month since intensified efforts to secure Baghdad and the western province of al-Anbar began in February. President George W. Bush ordered the deployment of the additional forces in January. At least 436 U.S. personnel have been wounded so seriously this month that they couldn&#39;t return to duty. Eight soldiers and an Iraqi child were hurt in a suicide bomb attack on a military checkpoint in Baghdad yesterday, the military said in a separate statement. ``It&#39;s been a tough month,&#39;&#39; Brigadier-General Perry Wiggins, deputy director for regional operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a televised Pentagon briefing yesterday. The fifth and final brigade of the roughly 30,000 additional U.S. forces deployed as part of the so-called ``surge&#39;&#39; has arrived in Iraq and will be operational by mid-June, Wiggins said. There has been an ``increase in fights with terrorists and extremists of all affiliations&#39;&#39; since the deployment of additional forces, U.S. military spokesman Major General William Caldwell said on May 23. ``We now have more troops conducting more operations involving more troops resulting in more confrontations,&#39;&#39; Caldwell said. Some 3,459 U.S. personnel had died in Iraq, of whom 2,834 were killed in action, as of 10 a.m. New York time yesterday. More than 25,000 had been wounded, 11,526 of them so seriously that they couldn&#39;t return to duty, according to the Department of Defense Web site. Pentagon figures showed that since the 3,342 U.S. deaths recorded in Iraq by the end of April, a further 117 service members had died this month, prior to the latest casualties.

The latest in a series of essays by the 80-year-old Castro, who has not been seen in public since becoming ill more than 10 months ago, was published on the front page of the Communist Party daily Granma. The Cuban leader said that Bush, asked recently about his Cuba policy, replied: "I'm a hard-line president and I'm only waiting for Castro to die." "I'm not the first, nor will I be the last, who Bush has ordered to be deprived of life," said Castro, who offered no details of the alleged conversation. American law now prohibits the U.S. government from ordering the assassination of foreign leaders, but declassified U.S. documents show that the CIA made numerous attempts to kill Castro in the early years after the 1959 Cuban revolution. "Ideas are not killed," Castro wrote. He criticized the Bush administration for spending on weaponry while people in developing nations go hungry. "I ask myself how many doctors can graduate with the 100 billion dollars that in just one year fall into Bush's hands to continue to sow mourning in Iraqi and American homes," he wrote. "The answer: 999,990 doctors, who could attend to 2 billion people who today receive no medical care." Castro shocked Cuba on July 31 when he announced that he had undergone emergency intestinal surgery and was stepping aside provisionally for his younger brother Raul, the defense minister, during his recovery. Although senior Cuban officials have said Castro is on the mend, it seems more unlikely with time that the bearded leader will return to power. In one of his essays this month, Castro offered a few new details about illness, saying that he had numerous operations and that the first procedure did not go well. Castro's exact ailment and condition remain state secrets, but he is widely believed to suffer from diverticular disease, which causes sacs in the colon that can become inflamed and bleed. .

By Kelly Yamanouchi Denver Post Staff Writer Article Last Updated: 05/30/2007 09:29:46 PM MDT A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union contends that a unit of Arapahoe County-based Jeppesen Sanderson Inc. provided flight support for the Central Intelligence Agency to transport suspected terrorists to facilities where they were tortured. Jeppesen, through its International Trip Planning Services, provides support such as itinerary planning, route planning and ground handling to businesses and government agencies. The ACLU filed the suit in San Jose, Calif., against Jeppesen's Dataplan unit, which does international trip planning and has U.S. operations in San Jose. The lawsuit says Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret "extraordinary rendition" flights over four years to countries "where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused" against legal standards. "Extraordinary rendition should be condemned. It should not be seen as a source of corporate profit," said ACLU executive director Anthony Romero. The suit cites an article from The New Yorker magazine that quotes an anonymous former Jeppesen employee recounting that Bob Overby, managing director of Jeppesen International Trip Planning, said during an internal corporate meeting, "We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights - you know, the torture flights. Let's face it, some of those flights end up that way." Jeppesen spokesman Mike Pound called the reported Overby comment "a third-hand report of something that somebody said - in other words, it's hearsay." "We really don't know much of anything about a trip of that nature," Pound said. "We don't need to know why a customer is taking a trip, and we don't ask." CIA spokesman George Little said in an e-mailed comment that the United States "does not conduct or condone torture, nor does it transport anyone to other countries for the purpose of torture. The goal of renditions is to get terrorists off the streets in a way that complies with our laws and treaty obligations." "Renditions have occurred far less frequently than some press reports suggest, and they are subject to careful review," Little said. Some U.S. corporations, the ACLU lawsuit says, "have furnished aircraft and personnel to transport persons identified by the United States as potential terrorist threats to detention and interrogation facilities overseas. Other corporations, including Jeppesen, have provided flight and logistical support services to these aircraft and crew." An ACLU official said he believes many other companies are involved and that he hopes they "take note." The ACLU filed the suit on behalf of foreign nationals Binyam Mohamed, Abou Elkassim Britel and Ahmed Agiza, who the suit says were flown overseas and tortured. It also petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review a suit that claims former CIA Director George Tenet violated U.S. and universal human-rights laws by authorizing agents to detain Khaled El-Masri. The suit was dismissed by a lower court after the government invoked "state secrets" privilege. "The government is the one that is liable," said Ved Nanda, a professor of international law at the University of Denver. "I think it will be very hard for the ACLU to win the case (against Jeppesen). But what it will do is bring the issue before the public, create awareness ... and so in that sense it serves the purpose." The suit cites customary international law and says Jeppesen should be punished by an award of punitive damages to be determined at trial. It also asks for compensatory damages of more than $75,000. The suit names Premier Executive Transportation Services and Aero Contractors Limited as owners and operators of aircraft that were flown to Morocco, Pakistan and other locations. "This puts other companies on notice, that they are likely to be blackballed and there are going to be people who probably think about them as also responsible for this kind of heinous act," Nanda said. A group called South Bay Mobilization has asked people to come to events in past months at Jeppesen's San Jose location and at a San Jose skating rink, urging them to "Join Us to Skate Against Torture" and "Abolish the Torture Flights," according to its website. Mark Loewenstein, a law professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said corporations must take into consideration potential liability. "The question is: Have they violated the law, did they knowingly violate the law, and do they have some kind of immunity (because it is work for the government)?" Loewenstein said.

A U.S. military helicopter hit a house and car at early Thursday killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home a police officer said. A U.S. military statement, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" on Thursday in Sadr City. BAGHDAD- A suicide bomber hit a police recruiting center Thursday in Fallujah, killing as many as 25 people, police said. The U.S. military said only one policeman was killed and eight were wounded. U.S. forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al-Qaida gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. The American military also reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed Wednesday in a roadside bombing in Baghdad and one who died of wounds from a roadside bomb attack northwest of the capital Tuesday. At least 122 American forces have died in May, the third-deadliest month of the Iraq conflict. U.S. forces also continued a search for five Britons who were kidnapped Tuesday in Baghdad, as well as for two of its soldiers who have been missing since a May 12 ambush south of the capital. The Fallujah suicide bomber killed at least 10 policemen in the attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. The rest of the dead were civilians, many of them in line seeking jobs as policemen. He said as many as 50 were wounded. Fallujah General Hospital had received 15 bodies and 10 wounded, according to a doctor there, who would not allow the use of his name because he feared retribution. The physician said he believed other casualties were taken to the nearby Jordanian Hospital and private clinics. A member of the Fallujah city council, who also asked for anonymity for fear of attack by insurgents, said there were at least 20 killed and 25 injured. The coordination of information in Fallujah was particularly difficult because the mobile telephone system has been working only sporadically. Maj. Jeff Pool of the Multi-National Force-West said the Anbar province governor's office and the provincial police put the total number of dead at one Iraqi policeman, with six police and two civilians wounded in Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated explosives in his vest at the third of four checkpoints, standing among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only opened Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The U.S. military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaida. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of Sunni insurgents and al-Qaida throughout the war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents called for U.S. help. Members of al-Qaida, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final exams, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from al-Qaida. Clashes continued into the afternoon, and the council official said the al-Qaida leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the U.S. military. U.S. forces, meanwhile, pressed on with the search for five kidnapped Britons, and a procession of mourners, some of them women wailing and beating their chests, marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a U.S. helicopter strike before dawn. The U.S. military said it had no report of airstrikes in Sadr City and that there were no civilian casualties in the second day of a search for the Britons, who were abducted Tuesday from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad. A U.S. military statement, however, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. AP Television News videotape from Sadr City showed the coffins of the victims atop a small bus with men and women walking behind, crying. A young boy could be seen sitting next to the coffins. A car in the area was punctured with big holes, as if hit by an airstrike. A police officer in Sadr City, who refused to allow use of his name because he feared retribution, said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 a.m., killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home&mdash;a common practice in Iraq's extreme heat through late spring and summer. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was wounded. Also in Sadr City raids, which the U.S. has been conducting with a select unit of Iraqi army forces, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi claimed his home was raided and ransacked by American forces at 3 a.m. Thursday. The military said it had no report of the incident. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. Dozens of U.S. Humvees and Bradley fighting vehicles had taken up positions around Sadr City at nightfall Wednesday. The five kidnapped Britons included four bodyguards working for the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld and one employee of BearingPoint, a U.S.-based management consulting firm. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. The Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, claimed responsibility. Wiggins also said that more than 100 patrols a day were being launched to search for two missing troops who vanished after a May 12 ambush near Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. Four Americans and one Iraqi soldier were killed in the attack and the body of another American was later found in the Euphrates River. "Our determination and resolve to locate our missing soldiers is unwavering," Wiggins said. The Mercury News is pleased to let readers post comments about an article at the end of the article.

(AP) -- Colorado State University hurricane researcher William Gray&#39;s revised forecast issued today calls for nine hurricanes this season, five of them becoming intense. The forecast calls for a very active season, with 17 named storms in the Atlantic basin between June 1 and Nov. 30 and a 74 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the U.S. coastline. Phil Klotzbach, lead author of the forecast, said the team expects an above-average hurricane season. The revised forecast is virtually identical to the prediction Gray&#39;s team issued in April. It calls for the same number of named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes. It also says there&#39;s a 50 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the East Coast, including the Florida Peninsula. The long-term average is 31 percent.

The Saturday Early Show CBS News Sunday Morning Up To The Minute Couric & Co. Home E-mail Couric & Co. Couric & Co. RSS Feed CBS News RSS Feeds Fidel Castro: Communist Columnist is a CBS News producer based in Havana, Cuba Cuban President Fidel Castro could have a career as a syndicated columnist. Despite his renown as a lengthy speechmaker, the convalescing leader is turning out short and to-the-point editorials on a nearly daily basis in recent weeks. His comments Tuesday evening focus on the upcoming G8 meeting in Germany. Once again he takes U.S. President George Bush to task, this time on the need to protect the environment and stop climate change. He quotes the German Minister of the Environment as telling the AFP news agency it will be “very difficult” for the G8 summit to successfully confront global warming due to U.S. opposition. Castro also takes a swipe at British Prime Minister Tony Blair for saying “he will persuade his friend George” on these issues. “The only sure thing,” writes Castro, "is that [Blair] is adding another submarine to the three currently being built in Great Britain, which brings the spending on sophisticated weapons up by another $2.5 billion.” In a previous editorial Castro said Cuba could train 75,000 doctors or build 3,000 sophisticated medical clinics in poor countries for the amount the four nuclear-powered attack submarines are costing Britain. Today Castro quips, “perhaps someone with one of Bill Gates' new computer programs could keep track of the resources for health, education and culture that this military spending denies humanity.” President Bush, who Castro refers to by his first name alone, “had better decide what he really thinks in the G8 meeting” on the dangers facing peace and the world’s food supply. “Someone should ask him about it,” writes the Cuban leader, concluding, “he should not try to get off with the advice of his friend Blair.” As has been their practice since President Castro began writing these pieces, the Cuban government sent an advance copy of the commentary dated 6:45 p.m. local time Tuesday, to the foreign press. Practically all of the commentaries he has written have been signed and dated at the end of what would be the regular work day for most people, between 5 and 8 p.m. Observers say that the regularity of his output and their timing suggests that for the first time in his life, Castro is following a normal schedule. If he is reading, writing and undergoing physical rehabilitation during the day and sleeping at night as they suggest, it represents a complete break with his previous pattern of working around the clock and only catching a few hours sleep mid-morning. The 80-year-old Castro has undergone, according to his own account, several operations to stem intestinal bleeding since the end of last July. The exact nature of the illness that has kept him out of the public eye is still unknown although he is widely believed to have suffered from diverticulitis with inflammation and bleeding of the colon. His condition obliged him to step down, “temporarily” handing power over to his younger brother Defense Minister Raul Castro ten months ago. 12:29 PM : May 30, 2007 Read more posts in Now you're in the public comment zone.

The Taliban said 35 people died in the helicopter crash in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan. Hours after the helicopter went down, the Taliban ambushed a police convoy on a main road in southern Zabul province and killed 16 policemen, the interior ministry said. Since the traditional winter lull, the resurgent Taliban have stepped up actions in recent months with a series of suicide attacks, roadside bombs and ambushes against foreign and Afghan forces. In an apparent response to the Chinook crash, a joint NATO and Afghan raid supported by air power killed and wounded dozens of Taliban in Sangin district, close to Kajaki where the twin-rotor NATO helicopter went down on Wednesday night, the Afghan defense ministry said. NATO said the fighting was part of a broader offensive called "Operation Lastay Kulang," from the local Pashto language for "axe handle," meant to extend the Afghan government's control into the north of Helmand province. Officials said 2,000 foreign and Afghan troops, including 1,000 British soldiers and elements of the elite U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, were involved in a push to loosen the Taliban's grip on the Sangin Valley. Helmand, a long-time bastion of the Taliban, is the leading drug-producing region of Afghanistan, the world's main heroin supplier. It has been the scene of a series of bloody fights between Taliban and Western forces in recent months. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

The letter, given last night to Lieutenant General Sutiyoso, blames a communication breakdown for the visit by Detective Sergeant Steve Thomas and a fellow officer. The letter also promises an investigation into why "security and protocol was less than satisfactory". "I apologise for the distress and inconvenience caused and regret your early departure from NSW," Mr Iemma says. Despite his earlier outrage, Governor Sutiyoso - who cut short his trip to Australia on Tuesday in apparent protest at the intrusion - last night accepted Mr Iemma's apology. The diplomatic incident was sparked after Sergeant Thomas was asked to deliver a request from the NSW Coroner for Governor Sutiyoso to attend an inquest into the death of one of five Australian-based journalists killed in Balibo, East Timor, in 1975, allegedly at the hands of a commando squad of which the Governor was a member. The easing of tensions came after Australian ambassador Bill Farmer visited Mr Sutiyoso at his City Hall offices for the second time yesterday to pass on the letter of apology having earlier conveyed his regrets. "I feel very touched with this letter, very satisfied," the Governor said. "There are so many apologies in it, in so many ways, that I must be big-hearted. I must thaw this row between Jakarta and NSW. A letter like this is almost too much - more than I need." An interim report on the incident was delivered to NSW Police Minister David Campbell yesterday and will now be included in a wider inquiry conducted by Mr Iemma's office. General Sutiyoso's chief of staff, Suhendro Baskito, yesterday said his boss was undressed when the police entered his room. "He was asleep, the two police woke him up. They were standing at the side of his bed. "He asked 'Who are you?' and they explained that they were police officers and wanted him to appear at the inquiry into the East Timor killings. "He immediately called me. I was staying in the adjoining room. By the time I got there he was wearing shorts and a T-shirt." A spokeswoman for the Shangri-La Hotel yesterday repeated claims that police had demanded access to the room, which was provided by the duty manager, using a master key.

Andrei Lugovoy, the man Britain wants to put on trial for Litvinenko's poisoning, said he believes British secret services and Boris Berezovsky, a wealthy Kremlin opponent now living in Britain, were involved in Litvinenko's murder. "Andrei Lugovoy's statement is, in essence, a Kremlin statement," Berezovsky, a multi-millionaire businessman who was a pall bearer at Litvinenko's funeral, told Ekho Moskvy radio station in a telephone interview. "This statement makes everything clear, it has become obvious that the whole campaign the Kremlin is staging around Litvinenko's murder is a campaign of state lies."

http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/67520.html&cid Indonesia demands apology from Australia as relations fray yet again Indonesia demands apology from Australia as relations fray yet again Wed, 30 May 2007 06:02:00GMT Australasia World News | Jakarta - The governor of Jakarta on Wednesday demanded an explanation and apology from Australia after he was issued an invitation to testify at an inquest into the 1975 deaths of five Australian journalists in East Timor. Sutiyoso, a former army general, cut short his trip to Australia and returned home Tuesday after being served the voluntary summons earlier that day at his Sydney hotel by two policemen who he said barged into his room. "Through the [Indonesian] Foreign Ministry, I ask that the Australian government explain what happened," he told reporters in Jakarta, according to the state-run Antara news agency. Sutiyoso, a potential Indonesian presidential candidate, also threatened to review Jakarta's sister city cultural agreement with Australia's New South Wales province, whose coroner is conducting the inquest. The incident has once again raised tensions in Indonesian-Australian relations. The countries have quarrelled in recent years over Australia's military assistance to East Timor when it broke away from Indonesia, human-rights issues, terrorism, Iraq and the conviction of several young Australians on drug charges on Bali. "We call on the government to send a protest to the Australian government over the incident," said Lukman Hakim Syaifuddin, a member of Indonesia's parliament from the United Development Party. The inquest, being held in Sydney, has heard evidence that the five journalists didn't die in crossfire in the town of Balibo, as Indonesia maintains, but were deliberately killed by Indonesian troops. Mark Tedeschi, counsel assisting the coroner, told the Coroner's Court that the "journalists were not killed by being caught in crossfire ... but rather were deliberately killed by the Indonesian troops who had arrived at the Balibo town square." Tedeschi said the journalists were trying to surrender to troops headed by Captain Mohammad Yunus Yosfiah, who went on to be Indonesia's information minister. "At least three of the journalists were shot by Indonesian troops after an order was given by Captain Yunus Yosfiah, ... who also joined in the shooting of those three," Tedeschi charged. He argued the journalists died because Jakarta wanted to cover up preparations for its invasion of East Timor a few months later. East Timor achieved independence in 2002. Sutiyoso, a retired general, was a member of a special operations team that entered Balibo in 1975 although he denies being there himself. The inquest by the New South Wales coroner followed lobbying by a wife of one of the reporters for it to be held and inconclusive Australian parliamentary inquiries. Indonesian soldiers have also been accused of killing a Dutch journalist in East Timor in 1999 after the province voted for independence in a United Nations-run referendum.

Turkey last carried out a major incursion into Iraq a decade ago, before the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. But separatist Kurdish guerrillas, taking advantage of power vacuum in northern Iraq, have escalated attacks on Turkish targets. Turkey complains the United States and Iraqi Kurds have done little to stop them. "As soldiers, we are ready," Gen. Yasar Buyukanit said Thursday, adding that the military was awaiting government orders before planning the offensive. The military needs parliamentary approval for the deployment. Public support for such an operation has increased after recent killings of soldiers and a suicide bombing that killed six people and which authorities blamed on the rebels. Many Turks &#8212; complaining of a lack of help from the U.S. and other allies &#8212; believe a major incursion would help finish off the rebels from the Kurdistan Worker&#039;s Party, or PKK, which has been fighting for autonomy of the Kurdish-dominated southeast since 1984, a conflict that has killed tens of thousands. Russian denies involvement in Litvinenko killing Bicycle programs catching on in major cities Europe leads in designing buildings that save energy Although the Turkish government promised to back the military, it has been slow in asking Parliament for approval to deploy troops, anticipating problems with Washington, Iraq and the European Union &#8212; all of which have urged Turkey to show restraint and find nonmilitary ways to deal with the Kurdish rebellion. Turkey&#039;s human rights records has been stained by allegations of excessive use of force in the fight against the guerrillas. And an incursion would also likely pit two U.S. allies &#8212; Iraqi Kurds and the Turkish military &#8212; against one another. Turkish intelligence reports say that Iraqi Kurdish groups, which previously supported the Turkish military in fighting the guerrillas, were preparing defenses against a possible Turkish incursion into northern Iraq. Ankara fears that Iraqi Kurds want to establish an independent Kurdish state, which could revive the aspirations of separatist Kurds in Turkey. The Turkish military also said it opposed Kurdish plans to seize oil-rich Kirkuk, and vowed to protect Turkmens living in the city. The United States opposes any unilateral Turkish military action, fearing it could destabilize northern Iraq &#8212; the most stable part of the war-torn country. Washington also fears that, if it supports Turkey, it could alienate the pro-American Iraqi Kurds. On Thursday, military trucks hauled more tanks and guns to the border area, local reporters said. The deployment has made it more difficult for the rebels to retreat to bases in northern Iraq, the military said. But U.S. State Department said Wednesday it had seen no evidence of a significant movement of Turkish military forces in the border. Meanwhile, Buyukanit also complained about what he said was a lack of help from allies. "Turkey does not receive the necessary support in its fight against terrorism," he said at an international security conference in Istanbul. "There are countries which directly or indirectly support PKK terrorism." Past cross-border operations have yielded mixed results, with many guerrillas sheltering in hide-outs and emerging again after most Turkish units withdrew. A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the military could set up a buffer zone in northern Iraq to block Kurdish rebels from entering Turkey. Turkey had set up a buffer zone along the 200-mile (330-kilometer) border in 1997, but gradually withdrew the bulk of its troops under international pressure, leaving about 1,000 inside Iraq. Those troops act as monitors, but have not pursued the rebels. "To set up a buffer zone, Turkey needs to secure the consent of both Washington and the Iraqi Kurds," said Nihat Ali Ozcan of the Economic Policy Research Institute in Ankara. "However, the military buildup clearly puts more pressure on U.S. and Iraqi forces to do something quickly." The Turkish military says up to 3,800 rebels are now based in Iraq, and up to 2,300 operate inside Turkey. Turkish troops, reinforced by planes and helicopter gunships, have killed 14 PKK guerrillas in operations near the border since Monday. On Thursday, suspected PKK rebels opened fire on a group of forest workers cutting down trees in the province of Bingol, killing one of them and injuring seven others, local officials said.

Days after extradition papers were served by UK authorities, Andrei Lugovoi said British secret services were involved in his former friend's murder. Worsening relations: Putin and Blair Litvinenko died in a London hospital in November after his tea was poisoned with rare radioactive isotope polonium-210. Mr Lugovoi says the British secret services were involved in his murder - and that his former friend had been working for MI6. Sky News Russia Correspondent Alex Rossi said the claims would intensify the already frosty relations between Britain and Russia. President Vladimir Putin's government has already made clear it has no intention of extraditing Mr Lugovoi. Referring to Mr Lugovoi's press conference, Rossi said: "The language fitted Soviet times rather than the 21st century. "He claimed Alexander Litvinenko had become too much of a nuisance for MI6 and effectively they got rid of him with polonium-210. "He's countering the allegations made against him and the circumstantial evidence of the polonium trail that followed him from Moscow to Britain. "And he's saying that it's not just Russia that has access to polonium-210, but that the poison would have the mark of a Soviet-style assassination and the blame would be batted back to the Kremlin." Mr Lugovoi claimed he had evidence that the British secret services were aware of what was happening even if they did not commit the murder themselves. Rossi added: "There may be a lot of people out there who think this is rubbish but there may also be people who think this has the ring of truth in it. "The key thing is that there are only a few people London who know whether this is true, and only a few people in Moscow who know whether this is true, and all of those people are either not with us any more or in jobs where they are not going to talk about it. "But it certainly ramps up the war of words between London and Moscow." This month Tony Blair himself criticised Russia, drawing attention to Vladimir Putin's energy policy, and saying he had concerns about human rights in Russia. Mr Putin, meanwhile, publicly criticised the UK ambassador to Russia for attending a conference organised by the opposition.

Drozdiak: Climate Change Seen as Major G8 Issue William Drozdiak, a longtime expert on transatlantic politics, says a major issue at the annual G8 meeting that begins on June 6 will be European efforts to persuade the United States to adopt limits on greenhouse gas emissions. He says that German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who will chair the meeting, believes a U.S. commitment on some limits is important to counter the &#8220;rising tide of anti-Americanism and distress with American policy in many parts of the world.&#8221; The annual G8 meeting will take place starting June 6 in Germany. You&#8217;ve been a longtime observer of these meetings. What do you expect this year? At the top of the list is the question of climate change. In the last couple of years, this has been one of the big issues at these G8 meetings [G8 refers to the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia]. In particular, Tony Blair, Britain&#8217;s Prime Minister, has made it a top priority. Japan has also made it a top priority, and now we see Chancellor [Angela] Merkel, who before becoming chancellor had been an environment minister, doing the same She wants to get the United States back in the game on acting in climate change. In fact, she&#8217;s going to have a private lunch ahead of the meeting with President Bush next Wednesday just before the group convenes. She will try to push him into greater cooperation on climate change. The broader theme she is stressing here is that there is a rising tide of anti-Americanism and distress with American policy in many parts of the world. She holds that not only is there widespread opposition to Iraq, but that many in the world have the perception that the United States places itself above international law. She feels the best way for the United States to gain some degree of moral leadership is to seize the initiative and act on this whole issue of global warming. That will be a very strong message from her. And this is to set new limits? Right, the Germans want a specific benchmark. They want to get all of the parties to commit to limiting the rise of worldwide temperatures to two degrees Celsius, which is 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and reducing global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The moral argument is that the United States accounts for 3 percent of the world&#8217;s population and produces 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. So, Merkel argues, we Americans really have a moral obligation to take the lead on this. I take it that India and China are not terribly interested in this? No. India, which has been invited to the summit next week, has already said it would reject these proposals because it fears that it would slow down its booming economy. And the American objections are the same: It&#8217;s too high a cost to the economy? Yes, and that it unfairly penalizes the United States. The United States argues that the most important thing to do is to bring China and India in. China, they claim, will soon surpass the United States as the world&#8217;s biggest polluter. So we need to bring these fast growing developing countries into the There&#8217;s been considerable strain in both U.S. and EU relations with Russia lately. Do you think anything can really be accomplished on that subject? This is again an important theme that will be playing out in the months to come. It was just announced that President Vladimir Putin will visit Bush at the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine [in early July]. The number one issue next week will be what to do about Kosovo, the southern Serbian province, which is heavily populated with Albanians. The UN envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, has proposed a slow-motion movement towards independence, but the Russians sided with the Serbs and have objected to any international change in sovereignty here. This all plays out against the background of growing distrust with what is going on in Putin&#8217;s Russia: the fear that Russia is backsliding away from democracy and that it is becoming once more a very assertive and possibly a belligerent neighbor for European countries. This places Germany, in particular, in a difficult position. While Britain and the United States have attacked Russia quite strongly about the risks of backing away from democratic reforms, the Germans say, &#8220;Look, we need Russia to play a cooperative role on several issues, whether it be on energy supplies&#8212;because Germany is Europe&#8217;s largest importer of Russian oil and gas (which covers about 40 percent of Germany&#8217;s energy needs)&#8212;and also on Kosovo; and the question on future sanctions in Iran; and also Darfur, where President Bush has asked for sanctions and both Russia and China object.&#8221; And of course the Russians are very upset about Poland. They have a ban on Polish meat which affects EU trade with Russia. Yes, and there are several other issues. There was a flap about a war memorial in Estonia that was taken down. You mentioned the Polish meat exports, and with Lithuania there&#8217;s been a fight over energy supplies. At least for the Europeans, Russia is emerging as one of the biggest foreign-policy headaches. They need to come up with a much more unified position. Of course Russia is crucial to get additional Security Council sanctions on Iran over the nuclear enrichment issues. In addition, the United States wants to deploy radar and interceptor missiles in the Czech Republic and Poland to thwart the threat of missiles being launched from Iran. They claim this will not have any effect on Russia, but the Russians say they don&#8217;t believe that. On traditional issues like the Middle East, I guess everything is so up in the air that not very much can be accomplished. Since the ministers [this week] from the United States, the European Union, and Russia will be in Potsdam, they&#8217;ll take a train to Berlin to discuss the future of the so-called &#8220;Road Map&#8221; for negotiations between Israel and Palestinians. I doubt they&#8217;ll take any dramatic steps because they&#8217;ll be waiting for a meeting between Prime Minister [Ehud] Olmert and the Palestinian Authority leader, Mahmoud Abbas, in a week or so. And on Iran, they also will await the outcome of a meeting between Ali Larijani, Iran&#8217;s negotiator on nuclear issues, and Javier Solana, the EU foreign minister. And if procedure follows precedent, they&#8217;ll have canned statements they&#8217;ll issue at the conference on these different subjects? Yes, they&#8217;ll come out with a whole sheaf of declarations, and whatever differences there are, they&#8217;ll try to mask them with some fuzzy language. But the atmosphere is slightly improved by the resolution of the flap over Paul Wolfowitz, who in effect was forced to resign as president of the World Bank. Europeans are very pleased with the announcement that Robert Zoellick will take over the presidency of the World Bank. They all know him from his days as a That&#8217;s right. He&#8217;s respected throughout Africa and other developing countries from his work as a trade negotiator. The Germans, in particular, are pleased with him. They have a lot of admiration for him dating back to his role in helping negotiate the peaceful reunification of Germany when he was an aide to former Secretary of State James Baker. I gather this will be an extraordinary outpouring of protests opposing globalization. These protests occur every time there&#8217;s a G8 meeting, right? Yes. This has really developed over the years, and it has turned pretty ugly, and in some cases, violent. I remember attending one conference in Genoa during which a protestor was killed, and this set off all sorts of angry and violent demonstrations. But the German fear is that the site where the summit will take place [Heiligendamm, a Baltic Sea resort] is fairly insecure in that it is very flat and easily accessible from different places. They probably regret deciding to hold it there, but it was done for political reasons because it&#8217;s basically the home base of Chancellor Merkel. What are these people most opposed to? Free trade? In some cases it&#8217;s the loss of jobs; in other cases, especially in poor countries, it&#8217;s the concern that their interests are not being taken care of in world trade negotiations. Most of all, it&#8217;s the belief&#8212;however wrongheaded it may be&#8212;that there is this small directorate of countries getting together to decide global policies and that others will have to deal with it. There has been a lot of debate in recent years about whether the G8 really accurately reflects the global economy of the day. There&#8217;s talk about inviting China, India, and Brazil along with [newest member] Russia into the G8 to expand it into an organization that looks more and more like the interests of the global economy. But right now, that has been blocked just as reform of the UN Security Council has been blocked. India will only be there to talk about global warming? India will be there and they will be part of the discussion on climate change. India will try to make the case that whatever problems there are with greenhouse gases, they were created by the developed world in their rush towards industrialization. They&#8217;ll argue it&#8217;s unfair to penalize the development of poor countries, particularly those with large populations like China and India with one billion plus people, from achieving greater prosperity. On climate change, it&#8217;s interesting how the Bush administration has been opposed to this since it took office. It wouldn&#8217;t agree to the Kyoto treaty, but the Senate didn&#8217;t support it either, right? Right, and there was a vote of something like ninety-seven to nothing opposed to the Kyoto treaty. There is widespread disagreement about this. However, it has gained greater attention in the United States now, partly because of the Al Gore movie [ ], and the growing recognition that climate change is a real threat that the United States has to do something about. The Democrats have woken up to this earlier than the Republicans. In fact, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, was in Berlin for the last couple of days meeting with German officials, including Chancellor Merkel. She acknowledged that the United States needs to show much greater leadership in trying to curb the threat of global warming. And the early indication is what? Right now, they&#8217;re still negotiating on the text, and the United States has expressed great displeasure with the declaration the way the Germans have drawn it up. They say while they&#8217;re not opposed to setting goals, they want the emphasis to be placed on reducing dependence on gasoline and greater energy efficiency rather than on measuring significant reductions in the production of greenhouse gases.

Andrei Lugovoi, the man charged by the UK with murdering the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, today claimed British intelligence had been involved in his death. Speaking at an extraordinary press conference in Moscow, he said UK security services had in the past tried to recruit him, and that Litvinenko was working for MI6. Mr Lugovoi claimed the British were trying to make him a scapegoat for the dissident's death by turning him into a "Russian James Bond". When the Guardian asked Mr Lugovoi whether he had any proof for his allegations that the British government was, in effect, responsible for Litvinenko's death, he replied: "I do." Litvinenko was poisoned by the radioactive isotope polonium-210, dying in a London hospital on November 23 last year. Mr Lugovoi said Britain was trying to recruit Russian citizens as spies to find compromising material on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The UK had sought "compromising information" on Mr Putin from him during business trips in previous years, he claimed, adding: "They are selling British citizenship ... it is sold in the same way that Chinese shirts are sold in the market." The former KGB bodyguard, now a wealthy businessman, accused Britain of being naive and careless in embracing Russian exiles such as Boris Berezovsky. He claimed to have three possible explanations for the death of Litvinenko, and alleged that both Litvinenko and Mr Berezovsky were MI6 agents. Litvinenko, he said, told him that the British, including MI6, were "complete idiots" who would believe anything you told them. Mr Lugovoi did not give a precise date for when he said UK intelligence had attempted to recruit him, but indicated that the alleged approach had happened in late 2005 or early 2006. The Foreign Office declined to comment on his claims. Last week, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to charge Mr Lugovoi with the murder of Litvinenko, an ex-KGB agent turned Kremlin critic. Mr Lugovoi today rubbished the British version of events, saying: "They're trying to portray me as a Russian James Bond who jump inside a nuclear reactor and poisons his Russian friend and children and wife - all done by one individual [Lugovoi]. What is the motive?" He met Litvinenko at a London hotel before the dissident become unwell, and was also contaminated with polonium-210, along with friend and business partner Dmitri Kovtun. Police found traces of polonium on Mr Lugovoi's wife and children. When a reporter asked him today who had killed Litvinenko, he said: "It is the matter of the prosecutors. I don't know who killed him." He added that "Litvinenko was not my enemy", saying he planned to hire lawyers in London and would "fight to clear my name". Mr Lugovoi said the CPS decision meant he would not be able to go to the UK to explain his case, and claimed he had previously been prepared to fly to Britain with his lawyers to speak to police at Scotland Yard. Earlier this week, the British ambassador to Moscow delivered a request for his extradition. Russian officials said the country's laws did not permit such an extradition, but also appeared to suggest Moscow could extradite Mr Lugovoi to the UK in exchange for Mr Berezovsky, an outspoken enemy of Mr Putin. British security and intelligence officials believe that former and possibly serving agents of the Russian state were behind Litvinenko's murder, arguing that only a state institution could produce polonium-210. &#169; Copyright Guardian Newspapers 2006 Use the feedback form below to submit your comments.

The U.S. military said only one policeman was killed and eight were wounded. U.S. forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al-Qaida gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. The American military also reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed Wednesday in a roadside bombing in Baghdad and one who died of wounds from a roadside bomb attack northwest of the capital Tuesday. At least 122 American forces have died in May, the third-deadliest month of the Iraq conflict. U.S. forces also continued a search for five Britons who were kidnapped Tuesday in Baghdad, as well as for two of its soldiers who have been missing since a May 12 ambush south of the capital. The Fallujah suicide bomber killed at least 10 policemen in the attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. The rest of the dead were civilians, many of them in line seeking jobs as policemen. He said as many as 50 were wounded. Fallujah General Hospital had received 15 bodies and 10 wounded, according to a doctor there, who would not allow the use of his name because he feared retribution. The physician said he believed other casualties were taken to the nearby Jordanian Hospital and private clinics. A member of the Fallujah city council, who also asked for anonymity for fear of attack by insurgents, said there were at least 20 killed and 25 injured. The coordination of information in Fallujah was particularly difficult because the mobile telephone system has been working only sporadically. Maj. Jeff Pool of the Multi-National Force-West said the Anbar province governor's office and the provincial police put the total number of dead at one Iraqi policeman, with six police and two civilians wounded in Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated explosives in his vest at the third of four checkpoints, standing among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only opened Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The U.S. military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaida. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of Sunni insurgents and al-Qaida throughout the war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents called for U.S. help. Members of al-Qaida, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final exams, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from al-Qaida. Clashes continued into the afternoon, and the council official said the al-Qaida leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the U.S. military. U.S. forces, meanwhile, pressed on with the search for five kidnapped Britons, and a procession of mourners, some of them women wailing and beating their chests, marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a U.S. helicopter strike before dawn. The U.S. military said it had no report of airstrikes in Sadr City and that there were no civilian casualties in the second day of a search for the Britons, who were abducted Tuesday from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad. A U.S. military statement, however, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. AP Television News videotape from Sadr City showed the coffins of the victims atop a small bus with men and women walking behind, crying. A young boy could be seen sitting next to the coffins. A car in the area was punctured with big holes, as if hit by an airstrike. A police officer in Sadr City, who refused to allow use of his name because he feared retribution, said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 a.m., killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home &mdash; a common practice in Iraq's extreme heat through late spring and summer. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was wounded. Also in Sadr City raids, which the U.S. has been conducting with a select unit of Iraqi army forces, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi claimed his home was raided and ransacked by American forces at 3 a.m. Thursday. The military said it had no report of the incident. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. Dozens of U.S. Humvees and Bradley fighting vehicles had taken up positions around Sadr City at nightfall Wednesday. The five kidnapped Britons included four bodyguards working for the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld and one employee of BearingPoint, a U.S.-based management consulting firm. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. The Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, claimed responsibility. Wiggins also said that more than 100 patrols a day were being launched to search for two missing troops who vanished after a May 12 ambush near Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. Four Americans and one Iraqi soldier were killed in the attack and the body of another American was later found in the Euphrates River. "Our determination and resolve to locate our missing soldiers is unwavering," Wiggins said.

Lee: trip to Japan is to have cultural exchanges Former President Lee Teng-hui is stressing the cultural and academic nature of his current visit to Japan. The comments appeared to be aimed at quelling concern in China that his visit would be political in nature. But Lee said Wednesday that he did not schedule any meetings with Japanese politicians. Lee also spoke on Thursday about a planned trip to visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine - a shrine which critics say is a memorial to Japan's militarist past. "My elder brother has been enshrined there for 60 years. I am his younger brother. Sixty years ago, he took a picture when he was conscripted and was about to leave for the Philippines. I have not seen that picture since then. It makes me cry when I think of it," said Lee.

Iran also refused to budge ahead of talks Thursday between Iran's chief international negotiator and the European Union's senior foreign policy official.

VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article Asked if it is time to change tactics in the world's nuclear standoff with Iran, Rice ruled out the idea of dropping a key precondition. "I think it's time for Iran to change its tactics," Rice said. There is increasing sentiment in Europe that world powers trying to engage Iran should drop the demand that Iran halt, or suspend in diplomatic parlance, disputed nuclear activities before bargaining on a package of incentives could begin. "The international community is united on what Iran should do, which is to suspend; to demonstrate that it is in fact not seeking a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power," Rice said. She spoke during a press conference with Austria's foreign minister, a year to the day after she made a dramatic outreach to longtime adversary Iran. The offer to talk "anytime, any place," was intended to inject new life into an ebbing European diplomatic effort to turn back Iran's advancing nuclear program. "I think the question isn't why won't we talk to Tehran. The question is why doesn't Tehran want to talk to us." Iran did not accept Rice's offer for the first Cabinet-level direct talks in nearly three decades because of the condition to stop enriching uranium. Enriched uranium is an ingredient for both the peaceful nuclear power Iran claims it wants or for the illicit weapons program that Washington suspects. "I repeat again that if Iran is prepared to take that course then we are prepared to change 27 years of American policy and sit with Iran to talk about whatever Iran would like to talk about," Rice said. "But that can't be done when Iran continues to ... try to perfect technologies that are going to lead to a nuclear weapon." Since Rice's offer, the Bush administration has embarked on a more cautious outreach to Iran. U.S. and Iranian diplomats have met twice to discuss the spiral of violence in . The United States accuses Iran of arming insurgents in next-door Iran, but Iran denies it. The disputed nuclear issue hangs over those limited talks. Tehran recently suggested a readiness to discuss a partial suspension of uranium enrichment, but the U.S. and key allies rejected the overture and Iran pulled back from the idea for starting talks on its nuclear program, diplomats said Wednesday With both sides back at their hard-line stances, an exploratory meeting Thursday between Iran's chief international negotiator and the European Union's senior foreign policy official was unlikely to make substantial headway, the diplomats told The Associated Press. In another sign of defiance, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad boasted that his country's military has become so strong that no adversary would risk an attack. "We have passed our point of vulnerability," he told Iranian state television. Later Thursday, Rice skipped on opportunity to continue a public argument with over U.S. plans to base a missile interceptor system in Europe. Speaking at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Rice did not mention Russia or the controversy that has dominated increasingly troubled U.S.-Russian relations in recent months. Rice referred to the Cold War roots of the organization, begun as a bulwark against the Soviet Union, and said its expansion to include all manner of nations proves her theory that some historical events that seem impossible one day become inevitable. "That is for me, a great benefit and a great inspiration in a world that is in a great deal of turmoil now," Rice said.

"There will be a full investigation," said Maj. John Thomas, a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force. "We will try to determine everything that happened and to fully investigate the site." A U.S. military official, who insisted on speaking anonymously because the crash was still under investigation, said initial reports suggested the helicopter was hit with a rocket-propelled grenade Wednesday evening. A purported Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, claimed in a phone call to The Associated Press that militants shot the helicopter down in southern Helmand province, the world's largest opium poppy-growing region where combat has been heavy in recent months. Ahmadi did not offer any proof for his claim, but he specified the helicopter crashed in the Kajaki district hours before NATO reported that information. Kajaki is the site of a hydroelectric dam and the scene of recent fighting. NATO said troops going to the crash site were ambushed by enemy fighters and the unit called in an airstrike "to eliminate the enemy threat." It did not say if the troops were from the U.S.-led coalition, NATO's force or the Afghan army. One civilian was injured by gunfire. The CH-47 Chinook, a heavy transport helicopter with two rotors, can carry around 40 soldiers plus a small crew. The fact it was flying at night suggested the aircraft might have been carrying troops on a nighttime air assault. Kajaki is the site of a large U.S.-funded hydroelectric dam now being repaired so it can provide electricity to the southern city of Kandahar. British troops, who make up the bulk of the forces in Helmand province, have been engaged in fierce fighting around the dam protecting it. The NATO force, which is responsible for a countrywide counterinsurgency campaign, has 37,000 soldiers, including about 14,000 Americans. There are 12,000 U.S. troops in the separate U.S.-led coalition, which trains the Afghan army and conducts Special Forces anti-terrorism operations. Helicopter crashes in Afghanistan have been relatively rare. A Chinook crashed in February in the southern province of Zabul, killing eight U.S. personnel. Officials ruled out enemy fire as the cause. In May 2006, another Chinook crashed attempting a nighttime landing on a small mountaintop in eastern Kunar province, killing 10 U.S. soldiers. In 2005, a U.S. helicopter crashed in Kunar, after apparently being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, killing 16 Americans. Elsewhere, a senior military officer said the U.S. had "the Taliban on their heels" in Afghanistan. Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Pentagon reporters that "the Taliban has suffered numerous losses and has suffered losses to their senior leadership over this past month" in southern and eastern Afghanistan. As a result, the Taliban has "reverted to asymmetric-type, small-scale, high-profile attacks," he said. Mullah Dadullah, a one-legged veteran who orchestrated an intensifying campaign of suicide attacks and beheadings, was killed in an operation in southern Afghanistan this month. He had been considered the top Taliban field commander. Still, Wiggins said that as the poppy harvest ends, more insurgents might join the battle. "So the fight's not over," he said. "But we'll continue to take the offensive through several of the operations we have in Afghanistan, and hopefully ... continue to inflict casualties on the Taliban."

Despised by Beijing for asserting self-ruled Taiwan's sovereignty, Lee could earn yet more wrath if he goes to the Yasukuni Shrine, which many in Asia see as a symbol of Japan's wartime militarism. The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article Although Japan says Lee's 11-day stay is for tourism only, China suggested that the trip would hurt ties already strained by issues stemming from Japan's World War Two aggression and disputes over borders and energy resources. "The aim of Lee Teng-hui's visit to Japan is to push forward Taiwan independence and to undermine China-Japan relations," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a regular news conference. "We feel strongly dissatisfied with Japan for allowing Lee to visit the country." China considers Taiwan, which Japan colonized for half a century up to 1945, as its sovereign territory. Lee, who led Taiwan from 1988 to 2000, said on Thursday he would like to visit Yasukuni, but sidestepped the issue of whether he would actually do so. Yasukuni honors millions of Japanese war dead -- among them soldiers from Taiwan and Korea who fought for their colonial ruler at the time -- but also a handful of convicted war criminals, including wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo. Lee's elder brother died fighting for the Japanese. "I still haven't said anything to anybody," he told reporters when asked if he would visit Yasukuni. "My older brother is honored there, and in 60 years I haven't been once. If it was your big brother, what would your feelings be?" A visit could further annoy Beijing and risk damaging the still fragile improvement of Sino-Japanese ties, only recently beginning to warm up after years of chill. The turning point was the departure last year of prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, whose regular visits to Yasukuni brought routine condemnation from Beijing. His replacement, Shinzo Abe, has so far avoided going to the shrine. But Jiang hinted on Thursday that Japan was not doing its part to keep relations on an even keel. "It takes the efforts of both sides to maintain the stable development of relations between China and Japan," she said. "We hope Japan can attach importance to China's serious concern, and properly resolve the issues of history and Taiwan through actions," she said. Beijing claims sovereignty over Taiwan. Ever since 1949, when China's Nationalist forces fled to the island after losing power on the mainland to Mao Zedong's Communists, it has demanded the Taiwan authorities accept reunification. On Thursday Japanese-educated Lee, accompanied by his wife, visited a museum to the Japanese haiku poet Matsuo Basho. During his stay, Lee is set to receive a prize in memory of Japanese colonial administrator Shinpei Goto and tour Japanese temples throughout the country.

The data were drawn from the United Nations, the World Bank, peace groups and the magazine researchers' own assessments.

Dudley George was shot and killed by a police sniper in Ipperwash Provincial Park on Sept. 6, 1995. His family has waited for more than 11 years for a public inquiry to answer some of the questions surrounding his death. Commissioner Sidney Linden found HarrisÂ did not order provincial police into Ipperwash Provincial Park to remove unarmed aboriginal protesters, butÂ he could have "urged patience, rather than speed" at resolving the dispute. "The federal government, the provincial government and the OPP must all assume some responsibility for decisions or failures that increased the risk of violence and make a tragic confrontation more likely," Linden said. George, 38, was killed by a police sniper's bullet as Ontario Provincial Police moved in on the occupation by unarmed protesters atÂ the parkÂ on the shores of Lake Huron on Sept. 6, 1995. LindenÂ said in his final report, released in Forest, Ont.,Â that he didn't believeÂ Harris when he claimed he never made a racist statement about the occupiers during an informal governmentÂ meeting with provincial policeÂ just hours beforeÂ George's death. Commissioner Sidney Linden called for the disputed land along the shores of Lake Huron to be returned immediately to the Stoney Point First Nation, along with compensation. Harris acknowledged during his testimony that he wanted the occupation brought to a quick end, but denied he said, "I want the fucking Indians out of the park," as former Ontario attorney general Charles Harnick alleged during his ownÂ testimony. "After carefully assessing the evidence, it is my view that Michael Harris made the statement," Linden wrote. "I agree with Premier Harris's characterization of the statement â€¦ as racist." Harris's sense of urgency, in contrast toÂ the "go-slow" approach of police,Â "created an atmosphere that narrowed the scope" of potential peaceful resolution to the occupation, Linden said. "The provincial government could have appointed a mediator or negotiator at any time, but did not," Linden wrote. "The premier could have urged patience, rather than speed." 'Damning indictment,' Falconer says Sam George, Dudley George's brother, praised Linden's findings as a "huge and wise step forward for natives and non-natives together."Â  "I hope it is as good for you as it is for us today," Georgeâ€™s brother said Thursday. Former premier Mike Harris, seen testifying at the inquiry in Forest, Ont., denied making a racial statement at an informal government meeting hours before George was killed. GeorgeÂ saidÂ his brother's legacy is that "he stood up for what he believed inÂ â€¦ and for that he paid the ultimate price." He added it would be appropriate for Harris to apologize to hisÂ family. Â  "I think that's not too much to ask," he said. But Harris's lawyer, Peter Downard, said the report showed no apology is required from the former premier. "He did nothing wrong," Downard told reporters Thursday. The finding that Harris uttered the commentÂ is "absolutely historic," said Julian Falconer,Â a lawyer forÂ theÂ Aboriginal Legal Services of Toronto who participated in the inquiry. "This is a damning indictment," FalconerÂ told reporters after the commissioner presented his findings. "Mike Harris has a lot to account for." The inquiry also blames the OPP for ill-informed actions, cultural insensitivity and racism, faulty intelligence and poor communications. Senior OPP officers on the scene relied on "unverified and inaccurate information" when the police raid was launched, Linden said. Linden alsoÂ faulted the federal government for expropriating disputed First Nations land for military use during the Second World War, then in a series of "successive neglects," failing to give it back as promised. In the more than 60 years following the action, the Stoney Point band tried to get the land back, claiming it contained a burial ground destroyed when the military camp was built. About 30 unarmed protesters occupied the park in the summer of 1995 in response to what they said were decades of frustration overÂ the unsettled land claim. Premier Dalton McGuinty launched the inquiry into the clash at Ipperwash only days after his Liberals swept to power in 2003. Linden called for the disputed land to be returned immediately to the Stoney Point First Nation, along with compensation. The report's other recommendations: Ontario should establish a permanent, independent and impartial agency to facilitate and oversee the settling of land and treaty claims. Ontario should improve public education about its land claim policies as well as aboriginal burial and heritage sites. Access to the Ontario land claims process should depend on whether the documentation filed by the First Nations provides clear evidence that there's been a breach of the legal obligations of the Crown. The OPP should establish a formal consultation committee with major aboriginal organizations in Ontario. Provincial police should establish an internal process to ensure racist and culturally insensitive behaviour by police is dealt with publicly. The province should establish and fund an Ontario Aboriginal Reconciliation Fund. With files from the Canadian Press YOUR VIEW: What is your reaction to the findings of the report?

Place a classified newspaper ad Balibo demand cop investigated By Rhett Watson and Cindy Wockner June 01, 2007 12:00 THE police officer who tried to subpoena an Indonesian politician possibly connected to the Balibo Five deaths is now under investigation as part of the diplomatic fallout. News of the internal review of the officer's actions came as NSW Premier Morris Iemma last night said he had written to Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso apologising for any distress and inconvenience during his stay in Sydney. "I apologise for the distress and inconvenience caused and regret your early departure from New South Wales," Mr Iemma wrote. Hundreds of angry protesters shouting anti-Australian slogans yesterday converged on the Australian Embassy in Jakarta for the second day. Indonesia has complained bitterly about the treatment of Mr Sutiyoso, who says police entered his Sydney hotel room unannounced to confront him on Tuesday afternoon. The NSW Coroner's Court confirmed yesterday that the officer had a subpoena for Mr Sutiyoso to appear before the Balibo Five coronial inquest, but delivered a verbal invitation when he realised the former general was in his room at the Shangri-La Hotel. Mr Sutiyoso, a retired military lieutenant-general, denies involvement in the 1975 Balibo shooting murders of five Australian newsmen, for whom war crimes charges may be brought. Police sources say Sergeant Steve Thomas, who was under instructions from the Deputy State Coroner, broke no laws in confronting the politician and his actions were now under review because of the political firestorm. Foreign Minister Alexander Downer spoke to his Indonesian counterpart Hassan Wirajuda last night, promising the matter would be investigated. "What the Governor claims is that he was having a rest in his room and two policemen just walked in . . . and suggested he may wish to go to a hearing of . . . a coroner's court," Mr Downer said. "He was, of course, outraged at this." Mr Sutiyoso, who returned to Jakarta on Tuesday night, left a 30-minute meeting with Australia's Ambassador Bill Farmer yesterday to say that the diplomat had told him he would "take care" to get a formal letter of apology. "I forgive him, he is an Ambassador, he represents Australia in Indonesia and he, in front of me and some of my staff, conveyed his apology and was very shocked and disappointed with that incident. We are a big-hearted country. Why shouldn't I forgive that?" The attempt to subpoena the senior Jakarta politician, tipped as a possible presidential candidate, sparked a chorus of condemnation from Indonesians and created a diplomatic row between the two countries. The second day of protests at the Embassy prompted the Department of Foreign Affairs to add civil unrest to its travel warning for Indonesia. Shangri-La management has revealed that the police officers arrived on Tuesday afternoon and requested access to Mr Sutiyoso's room. Staff then called the Governor's room, but when there was no answer they escorted the officers upstairs. "One of our staff rang the doorbell &ndash; they rang it a few times &ndash; and there was no answer," a spokeswoman said. The officers were let into the room, only to find Mr Sutiyoso inside. A police spokesman confirmed an internal review had begun.

http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-usfred0531,0,5517948.story%3Fcoll%3Dny-leadnationalnews-headlines&cid Actor Fred Thompson tests presidential waters - Newsday.com New York City News Actor Fred Thompson tests presidential waters WASHINGTON -- Actor Fred Thompson is taking a big step toward running for president, and early polls show the "Law & Order" TV prosecutor is likely to cut into support for a prominent real-life ex-prosecutor, Rudolph Giuliani. The former Tennessee senator will form a "testing the waters" committee in coming days that clears the way for him to enter the presidential race, possibly as soon as the July Fourth weekend, Thompson supporters said Wednesday. His entry would be sure to jumble an already volatile Republican field, where Giuliani leads in national polls despite deep doubts about him and two other top candidates among conservatives, who have been casting about for an ideological heir to Ronald Reagan. As a 6-foot-5 actor with a honey-dipped drawl, Thompson certainly looks the part, and he's got a solid conservative voting record to match, even if that record lacks major legislative accomplishments or executive experience. The idea of a Thompson candidacy has enticed some voters enough to push him into third place in national polls -- ahead of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who several analysts said yesterday has the most to lose if Thompson can pick up the conservative voters Romney is banking on. But Giuliani would suffer too if conservatives rally to Thompson's side and see in him what they have seen in the ex-mayor -- an electable candidate with the aura of celebrity. In Thompson's case, he has the added benefit of being in line with conservatives on issues like abortion and gun control, unlike Giuliani. "One of Giuliani's great strengths is that there was nobody in the race who could consolidate party support, and if Thompson does prove to be a strong candidate, he may be suddenly able to galvanize the right, which would be a problem for the mayor," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in Washington. Giuliani Wednesday welcomed a Thompson candidacy. "He has a great deal to offer," Giuliani said. "We'll all get a chance to make our point and I'm very comfortable with the idea that the Republican Party members get to decide who the candidate's going to be." Early polling on the race has suggested that a Thompson entry would draw voters away from Giuliani -- with a CNN poll earlier this month showing Giuliani dropping 9 points since March, while Thompson moved from zero in March to 13. A Quinnipiac poll this month showed Giuliani down 13 points and .Thompson up 14 since February. Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford), a former backer of John McCain in 2000 who is now supporting Giuliani, said .Thompson's entry would cause problems for the Arizona senator because they have an almost identical voting record. He acknowledged Thompson could cause problems for Giuliani down the line as well, but said he believes voters will see the difference between real life and TV when they are looking for a strong leader. "Rudy had 9/11, and Fred .Thompson had 'Law & Order,'" King said. Subscribe to Newsday home delivery Article licensing and reprint options Post a comment |

Tribunal Condemned by Syria, Others - Forbes.com U.N. Tribunal Condemned by Syria, Others 05.31.07, 8:50 AM ET Both Syria and the Lebanese opposition that it supports criticized the United Nations on Thursday for its decision to establish a tribunal to prosecute the killers of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Also Thursday, Lebanon reopened the road where Hariri was killed by a suicide truck bomb in February 2005. Beirut Mayor Abdel-Monem al-Ariss said the spot would remain "a historic symbol in the heart of Beirut." The tribunal has been at the core of a political crisis between the pro-Western government in Beirut and the Hezbollah-led opposition that has erupted into street clashes in recent months, killing 11 people. U.S.-backed Prime Minister Fuad Saniora had asked the council earlier this month to establish the tribunal, citing the refusal of opposition-aligned Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to convene a session to ratify the creation of the tribunal. Berri rejected these accusations Thursday, reflecting the opposition's bitterness over the government's move to take the issue to the U.N. "It is an honor I claim that I don't violate the constitution of my country or indulge in sowing divisions among its sons, and I left for you the opposite 'honor': ignoring (national) reconciliation and the constitution that guides us in Lebanon," Berri said in a brief statement. Syria, which has been implicated in Hariri's assassination by the U.N., was also quick to criticize the establishment of the tribunal under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which deals with threats to international peace and allows military enforcement. Shortly after the vote late Wednesday, Syria's official news agency, citing an unidentified official, said: "The formation of the international court under Chapter 7 is considered as a degradation of Lebanon's sovereignty that might lead to more deterioration of the situations on the Lebanese field." Syrian newspapers on Thursday also criticized the decision as an American-Israeli effort to exact revenge on Damascus, an opponent of both. Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied involvement in the assassination and threatened not to cooperate with the tribunal if it infringes on Syrian national sovereignty. Police cleared roadblocks in front of the 328-yard stretch of road where Hariri and 22 others were killed. The seaside boulevard had been closed for more than two years while the U.N. scoured the ground, adjacent buildings and the nearby Mediterranean Sea for evidence. Among the first to drive through was a passenger minivan, whose driver stopped, got out of the vehicle, knelt and kissed the ground, saying: "God have mercy on your soul." Earlier, Carole Farhat, who survived the bombing two years ago, watched as laborers filled the bomb crater with gravel and paved over it. She said she was glad to be alive "to enjoy this moment." "I've come to see the spot where I was seconds away from death. It might be a good sign for Lebanon and for us," said Farhat, who was thrown in the air by the bombing as she crossed the road. She lost much of her hearing and sustained injuries to her eyes. Daniel Germani, an engineer who was also injured in the bombing, said the reopening of the road would allow his team to repair the famous St. George Hotel, which was severely damaged in the blast. Five hotel employees were killed and eight were wounded, he said. He estimated damages to the hotel at $10 million, saying they had yet to receive compensation. The U.N. resolution gives the Lebanese parliament a last chance to establish the tribunal itself. If it doesn't act by June 10, the U.N. decision will automatically "enter into force." Saad Hariri, leader of the parliamentary majority and the son of the late prime minister, and Saniora have extended a hand to the opposition after the tribunal's approval. But ratification by the parliament so far appears unlikely entangled. Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militant group backed by Iran and Syria, had already warned against establishing the tribunal without parliamentary approval. Saad Hariri said after the vote late Wednesday the decision was a turning point in Lebanon that would protect the country from further assassinations. The vote is a "victory the world has given to oppressed Lebanon and a victory for an oppressed Lebanon in the world," he said, holding back tears at the end of his televised speech. Saniora, a longtime confidant of Rafik Hariri, also called the tribunal "a triumph for Lebanon against injustice, crime and tyranny." He urged the Lebanese to put their differences behind, saying the approval of the tribunal was a "positive step" for renewed dialogue to work together. Copyright 2007 Associated Press.

Bush had sought to have him killed. "Oh, my goodness," replied White House spokesman Tony Snow, when questioned about an article released on Monday in which Castro claimed: "I am not the first and will not be the last that Bush ordered deprived of life." "It's Fidel Castro," was the spokesman's only explanation. The 80-year-old communist leader, a long-time foe of Washington, has kept out of view since July 2006 when he fell ill but has kept up communications in recent months with a series of articles in the communist daily Granma. Monday's was his 13th article in two months. He has said he had several operations but the precise nature of his ailment remains a mystery. Castro came to power in 1959 when his forces toppled the US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. The United States considers Castro a major adversary and has long supported Cuban opponents of his government. In Monday's article, he alleged that Bush was recently queried "by an important person" over his Cuba policy and replied, according to the Cuban leader: "I am a hard-line president and I only await Castro's death."

Jakarta governor Sutiyoso cut short his trip to Sydney and demanded an apology after saying police had entered his hotel room uninvited as he slept. He said they wanted him to testify at an inquest into the deaths of five journalists in East Timor in 1975. New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma said he was "disturbed" by the report. "I apologise for the distress and inconvenience caused and regret your early departure from New South Wales," he wrote in a letter to Gov Sutiyoso, made public to news outlets. He said a review of the circumstances surrounding the incident revealed the state's "co-ordination of security and protocol was less than satisfactory". "This is extremely disappointing to me," he added. The apology appears to have dampened diplomatic tensions that had risen over the incident. Indonesia had lodged a formal protest. Gov Sutiyoso had been in Sydney at the invitation of the state government when police allegedly entered his hotel room as he slept. "They barged into my room after forcing the hotel to give them a duplicate key," he told reporters after returning to Jakarta. He said they asked him to sign an invitation to testify at the inquest into the five journalists who were killed in the East Timor town of Balibo on October 1975. Australia and Indonesia have always said the journalists died accidentally, having been caught in crossfire as Indonesian troops entered the town. A senior lawyer told the inquest on Wednesday that far from being an accident, the journalists deliberately shot by Indonesian troops after they tried to surrender, according to the testimony of witnesses. Gov Sutiyoso, a former general, said he had served in East Timor in 1975 but was never stationed in Balibo.

Professor William Gray’s team also kept with the prediction of a 74 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the United States coastline. Hurricane season starts Friday and runs through Nov. 30. Gray’s team says cooler Pacific Ocean waters near the equator should result in fewer trade winds this year to suppress hurricanes. It’s the opposite cycle to the El Nino last year that warmed the Pacific and drove more trade winds to shear apart storms in their early stages. “El Nino conditions during the summer and fall, similar to those that developed in 2006, tend to decrease Atlantic hurricane activity by increasing vertical wind shear across the area where Atlantic tropical cyclones develop,” Phil Klotzbach of the Colorado State team said in a prepared statement. Only 10 named storms -- five hurricanes and two major hurricanes -- developed last year. The long-term averages over the past 55 years is 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes per year. Earlier this month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it expects 13 to 17 named storms this year, including seven to 10 hurricanes — three to five with winds greater than 110 mph. NOAA anticipates a 75 percent chance of above normal season, a 20 percent chance near normal, and a 5 percent chance below normal season. NOAA officials said most tropical storms and hurricanes should form August through October over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, as is typical for above-normal seasons. Historically, above-normal seasons average two-to-four hurricane landfalls in the continental United States. Also this month, a University of Central Florida statistics professor and his Georgia colleague estimated Brevard County has a 19.4 percent chance of at least 74 mph winds this season, compared with the long-term average of 8.6 percent chance of winds that strong.

"It wasn&#145;t us who initiated a new round of arms race," Putin said when asked about Russia&#145;s missile tests this week at a news conference after talks in the Kremlin with Greek President Karolos Papoulias. He assailed the United States and other NATO members for failing to ratify an amended version of the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, which limits the deployment of heavy non-nuclear weapons around the continent. "And what about our partners? They are filling Eastern Europe with new weapons. A new base in Bulgaria, another one in Romania, a (missile defense) site in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic," he said. "What we are supposed to do? We can&#145;t just sit back and look at that." Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly rejected U.S. assurances that the planned missile defense installations are meant to counter a potential threat from nations such as Iran and pose no danger to Russia. "Either you ratify the treaty and start observing it, or we will opt out of it," Putin said. "It&#145;s dangerous and harmful," he added. "Norms of the international law were replaced with political expediency. We view it as diktat and imperialism." Putin described the tests of new missiles conducted by Russia on Tuesday as a necessary response to the Western action. In one missile test Tuesday, a prototype of new Russia&#145;s intercontinental ballistic missile, called the RS-24, was fired from a mobile launcher at the Plesetsk launch site in northwestern Russia and its test warhead landed on target 3,400 miles away on the Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, officials said. Russia&#145;s military also tested a new cruise missile based on the existing short-range Iskander missile. -- -- -- -- A publication by the Path Publishing Group.

The troops were ambushed south of Baghdad nearly three weeks ago. Four soldiers were killed in the initial attack and the body of a third kidnapped soldier was found days later. Brigadier General Perry Wiggins says there has been a side benefit to the search. Patrols have uncovered weapons caches and bomb-making facilities. The general says the hunt is also continuing for five British citizens who've been kidnapped, saying the US is doing all it can to find them. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"First and foremost, it&#39;s been a tough month," Brigadier General Perry Wiggins, deputy director of regional operations with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at a Defence Department briefing. May has been one of the deadliest months for US troops in Iraq. The deadliest was November of 2004, when 137 US troops died in Iraq, followed by April 2004 with 135. Wiggins said that the higher casualties were not entirely unexpected, given the "operational risks" associated with President George W Bush&#39;s "surge" of thousands of additional American troops into some of Iraq&#39;s most dangerous hotspots. "We&#39;re moving into places where we haven&#39;t been, not necessarily before," Wiggins said. "We&#39;re having more contacts with the enemy." At least 3 465 US forces have died in Iraq since the March 2003 US-led invasion, many while fighting the ongoing insurgency there.

"In this regard we believe that the Security Council must act on behalf of the international community impartially and without any political bias," the Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on the resolution which was tabled Wednesday. "South Africa as a matter of principle abstained on voting for the current resolution on Lebanon in the Security Council." The resolution imposes the formation of a Special Tribunal to prosecute any people identified by the Lebanese authorities and the United Nations International Independent Investigation Commission, as suspects in the assassination of the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafiq Hariri and other prominent Lebanese leaders. South Africa embarked on the first year of its two-year non-permanent tenure in the Security Council in January, and was Council President in March. Following Mr Hariri&#39;s death as a result of a car bomb in 2005, President Thabo Mbeki extended South Africa&#39;s heartfelt condolences to the government and the people of Lebanon. Mr Hariri was also a major stakeholer in the mobile phone service provider, Cell-C. South Africa believes imposing the Special Tribunal under the current circumstances will detrimentally affect the political stability of the already fragile Lebanese State, explained the department. Further to this, the move would politicise international criminal law and thus undermine the very foundations of international law. "South Africa, joins other members of the Security Council in calling for the Lebanese ownership of the process and for the Security Council to respect the sovereignty and constitution of Lebanon and to refrain from taking sides in internal Lebanese politics," said the department. "For South Africa, the key principle is that all violators of international law including international humanitarian law in Lebanon are brought to justice and not only those who perpetrate criminal acts against one faction within Lebanon." Following Wednesday&#39;s vote, Government reiterated its strong condemnation of the assassination of former Prime Minister and called for a thorough investigation into the incident. "In this regard there exists general consensus within Lebanon and internationally for the UN to assist the Lebanese authorities in their efforts to bring to justice those responsible for this heinous act," the department said. "There is also widespread support for the creation of a Special Tribunal based outside Lebanon and composed of both international and Lebanese judges as well as prosecutors." Accordingly South Africa supports the need for a Special Tribunal to ensure those responsible for these horrific crimes to be brought to justice. "However, our view is that the Tribunal should be the product of consensus within Lebanon as required by the Lebanese constitution and not an imposition of the Security Council," the department said. During another major Security Council vote in January, South Africa voted against a draft resolution regarding the situation in Myanmar, the former Burma. The country views the situation there as a human rights issue which should be handled by the proper organ within the UN, namely the UN Human Rights Council. Political analyst at the University of South Africa, Jo-Ansie van Wyk told BuaNews that South Africa&#39;s decision was in line with its foreign policy. "In terms of its foreign policy, South Africa wants to use the right organs for the right issues and its decision to vote against the resolution is about playing by the rules," Ms Van Wyk said. "The issue is work specific to the UN Human Rights Council, which is why South Africa is against the burdening of other UN organs with work that is outside their mandate." The resolution also called for the release of Myanmar&#39;s Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, which Mr Pahad said South Africa supported. During South Africa&#39;s tenure as Council President in March, an important resolution was also tabled regarding Iran&#39;s nuclear energy programme. Adopting resolution 1747 (2007), submitted by France, Germany and the United Kingdom, the Council affirmed its decision that Iran should suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development, to be verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). International Organizations and Africa Middle East and Africa This resulted in the Security Council widening the scope of its December 2006 sanctions against Iran for its refusal to abandon all its Uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. However, before the resolution was adopted, South Africa, later joined by Indonesia, had called for certain amendments to be made to the draft resolution to make it "proportionate, incremental and reversible" for the Council, said South Africa&#39;s Ambassador to the UN Dumisani Kumalo. South Africa has long supported Iran&#39;s and other nations&#39; use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, and is a signatory of the Nuclear Non-proliferation treaty. &copy; 2007 BuaNews.

Although hardly a megawatt star , he brings positive attributes to the job. First, as a key player in bringing China into the World Trade Organisation, Zoellick is a proven internationalist in a US administration in which internationalists have sometimes seemed like an endangered species. Second, he is a firm believer in the power of markets and free trade, which have clearly done far more to alleviate poverty over the past half-century than any aid programme. Third, he seems to have been a consistent behind the scenes supporter of the World Bank, whereas many of his Bush administration colleagues would be just as happy to see it shut down and its Washington headquarters turned into private condominiums and offices. So, presumably, he has a constructive vision for the bank&#x2019;s future. But Zoellick is not without his weaknesses. First and foremost, his appointment extends the outmoded practice of always installing an American in the job. With the bank tirelessly preaching the merits of good governance, its failure to adopt democratic principles undercuts its own legitimacy. The claim that the World Bank needs an American president to ensure that the US keeps donating money is ridiculous. The annual cost of the US contribution to the World Bank is relatively minor. Any number of developing countries, from China to Brazil, could easily step up if the US foolishly stepped down. Zoellick&#x2019;s background as a lawyer hardly makes him perfect for the job, either. The World Bank presidency is not about negotiating treaties, as Zoellick did when he was US trade representative. The bank&#x2019;s most important role in development today is as a &#x201C;knowledge bank&#x201D; that helps aggregate, distill and disseminate best practices from around the world. In this respect, the bank&#x2019;s technical assistance to governments is very similar to what private consultants offer to companies. Moreover, many of the World Bank president&#x2019;s most important decisions involve economics in an essential way. Wrong economic decisions, such as in the 1970s when Robert McNamara pushed grandiose but environmentally devastating infrastructure projects, have haunted the bank for decades. The biggest question mark, though, is whether Zoellick will be able to hit the ground running and implement desperately needed reforms. Reform number one, of course, is to ensure that the next World Bank president is not an American. Rodrigo de Rato, Zoellick&#x2019;s counterpart at the European-dominated International Monetary Fund (IMF), has already suggested that his successor should be chosen in a more inclusive process. The bank should be ashamed that its president has not yet offered a similar proposal. Second, Zoellick should ask why the bank spends only 2,5% of its budget on the &#x201C;knowledge bank&#x201D; research function it trumpets in its external relations materials, while it spends three times that amount on maintaining its executive board. Third, Zoellick should use his formidable negotiating skills to cajole rich countries into greatly increasing the grant component of World Bank aid. The idea that a big government-guaranteed global bank is needed to fill holes in private capital markets is laughable nowadays. True, the bank&#x2019;s poorest clients have little access to private capital markets. By and large, however, the poorest countries need grants, not loans that they still won&#x2019;t be able to pay in 20 years. As the bank switches from loans to grants, it can use some of its massive retained earnings to endow its &#x201C;knowledge bank&#x201D; function and related technical advice. But all this knowledge shouldn&#x2019;t be free. A lot of technical advice falls on deaf ears, with countries listening only long enough to get their hands on bank money. Instead of merely pushing its agenda, the bank should start charging for its technical advice on a graduated scale so that more of its engagements are client-driven. Last but not least, the bank needs to play a much bigger role in environmental issues and, in general, in promoting good international citizenship. Of course, Zoellick could just attempt to fill the role symbolically and do little or nothing, as some of his predecessors have done. Or, less likely, he could embrace some megalomaniacal vision of government intervention, as others have tried. In any case, let&#x2019;s wish him luck. The world needs the World Bank a lot more than it needs another condominium.

Police say three children were in Banaszewski's minivan when she was stopped and refused to take a breath test for alcohol. A license suspension is automatic in such cases. A spokesman for the DuPage County State's Attorney's office says Banaszewski, who lives in Wheaton, must also pay a fine of $$2,155 and work 140 hours of public service.

Speaking a week before he meets leaders of the Group of Eight (G-8) industrial nations in Germany, Putin said Russia's tests on Tuesday of a two new missiles were a direct response to U.S. moves to create a missile defense system. "We are not the initiators of this new round of the arms race," Putin told a joint Kremlin news conference with visiting Greek President Karolos Papoulias. "There is no need to fear Russia's actions: they are not aggressive," he said. "They are a mere response to harsh and groundless unilateral actions by our partners and are aimed at maintaining the balance of forces in the world." Putin's comments, which will be popular among ordinary Russians in a year when there is a parliamentary election, are the latest in a line of harsh outbursts against the West. Russia on Tuesday test-fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile with multiple warheads and a new cruise missiles, which Russian generals say are sufficient to ensure the country's security for the next 40 years. "Our partners are stuffing eastern Europe with new weapons," Putin said. "What are we supposed to do? We cannot just observe all this." Moscow has been alarmed by U.S. plans to deploy elements of its global missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Washington says it wants to avert attacks from "rogue states" such as Iran but Russia sees a threat to its own security. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Click me to Learning from Ipperwash will help prevent future violent protests: commissioner Two aboriginal protesters man a barricade near the entrance to Ipperwash Provincial Park, near Ipperwash Beach, Ont., on Sept. 7, 1995. (CPimages '95) Chinta Puxley, Canadian Press Published: Thursday, May 31, 2007 FOREST, Ont. (CP) - The federal government's unwillingness to settle aboriginal land claims, the impatience of the Conservative Ontario government and the cultural insensitivity of the provincial police all contributed to the shooting death of unarmed aboriginal protester Dudley George in Ipperwash Provincial Park 12 years ago, an exhaustive public inquiry concluded Thursday. "It is impossible to attribute Mr. George's death to a single person, factor, decision or institution," Commissioner Sydney Linden said following the release of his four-volume report on the police shooting in September 1995. "On the contrary, it was the combination of these that made a violent result more likely, particularly when they all came together in the space of a few short days and hours in the context of a highly-charged confrontation. Individuals and institutions need to be held accountable for the consequences of their decisions and actions, whether those consequences were intended or not." "The federal government, the provincial government, and the OPP must all assume some responsibility for decisions or failures that increased the risk of violence and make a tragic confrontation more likely." While the federal government has allowed aboriginal land claims "to fester for decades," Linden faulted then-premier Mike Harris for giving police 24 hours to remove aboriginal protesters from Ipperwash Provincial Park, just days after they occupied it claiming it was the site of a sacred burial ground. Harris uttered a racial slur at a meeting hours before George was shot by a police sniper, Linden concluded, but the premier did not direct police to enter the park or prompt them to conduct the botched raid. "After carefully assessing the evidence, it is my view that Michael Harris made the statement 'I want the f**king Indians out of the park'," Linden wrote. "I agree with Premier Harris's characterization of the statement . . . as racist." The government's "imperative for speed" and its reluctance to examine the legitimacy of the aboriginal claim made it virtually impossible for either side to negotiate an end to the dispute, Linden concluded. "The provincial government could have appointed a mediator or negotiator at any time, but did not," Linden wrote. "The premier could have urged patience, rather than speed." Provincial police also made negotiation unlikely because of their "cultural insensitivity," poor communication and unwillingness to involve aboriginal mediators, Linden said. "Cultural insensitivity and racism on the part of some of the OPP officers involved were evident both before and after Dudley George's death and created a barrier to establishing effective communication and to developing a level of trust with the occupiers which in turn, made a timely, peaceful resolution of the occupation more difficult," Linden said following the release of his report.

Here are excerpts of his statement. ON THE BRITISH SECRET SERVICES' ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE POISONING "It's hard to get rid of the thought that Litvinenko was an agent who got out of the secret service's control and was eliminated. Even if it was not done by the secret service itself, it was done under its control or connivance." Asked if there was evidence of their direct participation, Lugovoi said: "There is." ON ALLEGEDLY BEING RECRUITED AS A BRITISH SPY Mr Lugovoi said in 2005 Mr Litvinenko invited him to London where he proposed the idea of starting a joint business. Mr Lugovoi went on to say that he was paid too much money for giving minor consultations to British business partners. "It became clear that the fee was aimed at gradually engaging me in co-operation. The talks were becoming more open. The British started to show interest in everything: my connections, financial opportunities, if I had direct access to the Russian president's administration, as well as contacts with officers of the Federal Security Service, the Federal Bodyguard Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service. They were especially interested in an opportunity to get information about the FSB activities in the so-called English direction. "They openly begun to recruit me as a British intelligence agent. The British, in essence, suggested that I gather any discrediting information about President Vladimir Putin and members of his family. For example, it was proposed that I gather information about a state official, through whom they intended to get discrediting information about the president. In particular, they intended to lure this state official to London in order to get discrediting information about the president in exchange for silence about his personal bank accounts. I will tell investigators of the prosecutor-general's office who I'm talking about. "For maintaining an undercover connection, I was given a British mobile phone, which I was supposed to use for calling from Moscow to London. From bad to worse: Litvinenko gave me an edition of Yevgeny Grishkovets' book Rubashka and told me that now we have to use cipher like in spy movies and to encode a text using numbers of pages, paragraphs and lines. "One has to be a complete idiot not to understand that under the pretext of developing a joint business, a banal recruiting was going on with concrete political and intelligence goals with regard to Russia and its president. "I do not regard myself a passionate supporter of President Putin and I have my personal reasons for that, which many can guess about. But I was taught to defend the motherland, not to betray it. During another meeting with Litvinenko, I told him straight everything I thought about that and said that I was not interested in such business." ON ALLEGEDLY BEING MADE A SCAPEGOAT Mr Lugovoi said the British had already made up their minds that he was guilty of killing Mr Litvinenko. "For a long time I was constrained by my obligations to the Crown Prosecution Service. I was willingly co-operating with the crown prosecutor's office and I was answering every question. I was also answering all the questions that the Scotland Yard investigators were asking me. Even then I had a feeling that all the questions were just a formality and the accused were already determined, that is myself and Dmitry Kovtun. But I tried to keep all the obligations... and I was made a scapegoat." He said the British had hoped he would stay silent, but that he was not going to allow them to push their agenda. "Just think of it: they have found a Russian James Bond, who enters into nuclear centres and in cold blood poisons a friend of his and, at the same time, poisons himself, his friends, children and wife. And all that was done single-handedly by the terrorist Lugovoi. Who - as a result - loses his business and clients. And the main question: what for? Where is the motive for my crime? "London was hoping that I would keep silent as I have not been extradited... and that all the questions would resolve themselves: I would be branded as a criminal; Berezovsky would get a very good reason not to be extradited to Russia; Scotland Yard and the British special services would save face in the eyes of their taxpayers; while Russia and its leadership would be discredited for a long time. "Only none of this will happen. I am prepared to lose even more money, but I will fight for my honest name. I understand that if I went to London, I - for the sake of preserving somebody's professional honour - would be convicted, no matter what. That is why in the very near future, as we have done before, I will hire serious lawyers in London in order to defend my honest name in the British law-enforcement agencies. "If the British authorities refuse to conduct a fair trial, I will be prepared to appeal to the international court in The Hague." ON WHY HE BELIEVES THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM ARE WRONG "Now I would like to return to the issue of [Litvinenko's] death. First, I don't think you have to be a lawyer to understand that a motive is needed to carry out a crime like this. Sasha [Litvinenko] was not my enemy. I did not have any opinion on what he was doing in London, which books he was writing and who he was criticising. I have been a businessman for a long time now, and this didn't really interest me. "Second, for some reason all British newspapers are saying that the poisoning took place on 1 November, but Litvinenko and I met twice in October. Moreover, we met in his home in summer, when his wife Marina was away. By the way, Berezovsky didn't know of that meeting. It was almost the ideal place for a poisoning. However, when conditions were ideal, it didn't happen. But in a bar with a lot of people, when he could have failed to turn up, in the presence of dozens of witnesses, it happened. This means that someone wanted us to be seen together in the Millennium Bar. "Third, those who know Sasha can confirm that he never drank or smoked. Neither I nor Dima [Dmitry Kovtun] can remember whether he ordered anything, tea or water, because we were preparing to go to a football game at the time and, since it was cold, had drunk a good amount of spirits. What kind of idiot poisoner would it take to act in such a primitive way? Again, somebody wanted to set us up. "Fourth, if the poisoning took place on 1 November, then how did the polonium leave traces [changes track], I underline, it only left traces in places in London where I and Litvinenko met in October. And why was the polonium found in aircraft on which Dima and I returned to Moscow and Germany respectively in October 2006? My only conclusion is that we were purposely marked with polonium in order to use us in a political scandal later. "[Fifth,] I came to London with my wife and children to go to a football game. As a consequence, all of them were checked for polonium poisoning and the results were not comforting. They were tested together with me in the hospital. What kind of monster would you have to be to expose the lives of your children and your wife to such threats? "Sixth, already in summer 2006 Litvinenko started giving me various little gifts. When I was tested in the hospital, all my things were checked. It turned out that souvenirs and a number of documents which Litvinenko had given me long before 1 November were splattered with polonium. I told our investigators in the Prosecutor-General's Office about this, but they said that their British colleagues weren't interested for some reason. It is possible that Litvinenko himself left the traces (of polonium), but this theory was unacceptable to the British justice from the very beginning. "Seventh, it is no longer a secret that all my meetings with Litvinenko were thoroughly followed by the UK secret services. Why didn't they follow up Litvinenko's poisoning and allow all of us to leave Britain without punishment? Why has the address where we met British agents, [names omitted], not been included among the dozens of places in London mentioned in the media where polonium has been found? I would like to know whether polonium traces was found in that office, which is in essence one of their secret meeting places."

PM Blair Lashes Out At Africa "Vanity Trip" Critics [] 5/31/2007 12:52:23 AM Prime Minister Tony Blair arrived in Sierra Leone to a warm welcome and has lashed out at critics back home of his week-long trip to Africa. Blair's trip, just before he steps down as PM, has come in for some sharp criticism at home, for spending his last few weeks in power globe trotting at taxpayers' expense. Tory leader David Cameron has accused him of behaving like a "pop star" on a farewell world tour which serves no purpose but to "indulge his vanity." Labor MPs are also said to be frowning over Blair's "farewell tour," which has taken him to the US, France and Iraq. Blair hit back saying "The one thing I have come to despise more than anything else in my 10 years is cynicism". He said there had been real progress in Sierra Leone where the British sent peacekeeping troops during his first term of office. Speaking after talks with the country's President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Blair said: "However ferocious the challenges are in this part of Africa it's better to intervene and try to make a difference than stay out and try to cope with the consequences at a later time." Sierra Leone, which is now stable but remains desperately poor with high levels of corruption, is expected to hold presidential elections in August, the first poll since UN peacekeepers left in 2005. UN Security Council Approves Hariri Murder Trial Court [] 5/31/2007 12:29:39 AM The UN Security Council on Tuesday unanimously approved a resolution in favor of the creation of an international court to try suspects in the murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Russia, China, South Africa, Indonesia and Qatar abstained from voting in the resolution that was adopted by 10 votes to zero. Lebanon must now ratify the proposal by June 10, failing which the Security Council may independently authorize a tribunal, as it did in the case Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Hariri and 22 others were killed in a massive car bomb in the capital, Beirut, on February 14, 2005. A UN investigation into the killing implicated Syria and Lebanese security forces in the attack, although Damascus strongly denied any involvement. Four pro-Syrian Lebanese generals accused in the murder have been under arrest for more than a year. Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora welcomed the Security Council resolution saying the ratification of the international tribunal is a victory for Lebanon, and for all the Lebanese. Rafik Hariri's son Saad Hariri, said the tribunal was a turning point for the country and "an opportunity for all Lebanese to unite". Syria reiterated its stance that the special court violated "Lebanese sovereignty" and could plunge Lebanon into further instability. Syrian President Bashar Assad has said any Syrial would not deport any Syrian suspects and they would be tried in Syria. Copyright &copy; 2007 RealTimeTraders.com, Inc. All rights reserved.

Two soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb during a foot patrol Wednesday, the military said without specifying the exact location. Another soldier died from a "non-battle related cause" in Baghdad Tuesday, bringing the total for May to 116, the highest since 137 troops died in the November 2004 full scale invasion of Fallujah. Speaking of May, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of regional operations with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at a Pentagon briefing, "First and foremost, it's been a tough month." Wiggins attributed the rise in casualties to an ongoing security crackdown, explaining that four years into the occupation, "we're moving into places where we haven't been, not necessarily before." The latest fatalities bring the number of US soldiers killed in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion to 3,468, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures. On Thursday, the US military said five Americans and two other soldiers died when a Chinook helicopter was apparently shot down in Afghanistan's Helmand province. Democrats in control of the US Congress have been pressing Bush to agree to a timetable for pulling troops from Iraq, an idea firmly opposed by the president. The White House said Wednesday Bush would like to see a lengthy US troop presence in Iraq like the one in South Korea. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid immediately shot back, saying it is time for Bush to "recognize the reality on the ground in Iraq" that US troops are mired in Iraq and a change in course is urgently needed. "Democrats know that Americans demand realistic plans, not more White House rhetoric, rosy predictions and best-case scenarios," Reid said. Meanwhile, South Korea denied reports that it was leaning towards the extension of the stationing of its troops in Iraq. On Wednesday, a US television news claimed that South Korea has decided to extend the stay of the troops by another year while reducing the size of the contingent to 800 or 900. But South Korean Defense Minister said "there is no change in our position to submit a plan on terminating the mission of troops to parliament by the end of June". The latest fatalities bring the number of US soldiers killed in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion to 3,468. Make Alalam your homepage Copyright © 2004 - 2007 Alalam Inc.

Security Council vote to set up a tribunal to try the killers of Rafik al-Hariri, the former prime minister's son said on Thursday. Pro-Syrian politicians and parties, including President Emile Lahoud and Hezbollah, said the United Nations had ridden roughshod over Lebanon's constitution and could provoke further divisions in a country still haunted by its 1975-90 civil war. The Security Council voted on Wednesday to set up the court after failed efforts to get its statutes constitutionally approved in Lebanon, where a political crisis has paralyzed normal government for months. Syria said after the vote that it could lead to more instability in Lebanon. Saad al-Hariri, the son and political heir of the slain premier, told Reuters the tribunal would end the impunity that political assassins have enjoyed in Lebanon for four decades. "How could the tribunal affect the security of Lebanon? How could punishing the people who killed Rafik al-Hariri... affect the security of Lebanon?" Hariri said in an interview. "If Lebanon is going to be unstable it is the doing of those who say that Lebanon is going to be unstable," he said. "They (the Syrians) won't be able to destabilize us because they tried before and they have failed." Hariri and his allies in the governing coalition accuse Syria of orchestrating the February 14, 2005 bombing which killed Hariri and 22 others in Beirut. They also say Damascus was behind a string of other attacks on anti-Syrian figures. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

Leaders of the Group of Eight rich nations meet in Germany next week with President George W. Bush resisting pressure by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to agree to cap emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels. But Bush is not alone in presiding over rising emissions. "Growth rates ... of emissions in the U.S. are slowing," said Michael Raupach, of the Earth Observation Centre in Canberra, Australia, of overall greenhouse gas trends. "European emissions are creeping up in the post-2000 years." National data submitted to the U.N.'s Climate Change Secretariat show that overall emissions by G8 nations rose 2.0 percent from 2000 to 14.3 billion tonnes in 2005 and were up 0.7 percent since 1990, the base year for the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol. Among G8 nations, Russia, Italy and Canada have all had bigger rises than the 1.6 percent U.S. gain since 2000, when Bush won election to the White House. The revival of the Russian economy after the collapse of the Soviet Union is a main spur. Only Britain, Germany and France have cut back since 2000. Since 1990, however, the United States has had a 16.3 percent rise, second worst behind Canada. All G8 nations back Kyoto except the United States, the biggest world emitter. And Kyoto nations expect falls in emissions in coming years when investments, for instance in energy efficiency or wind or hydro power, will take effect. G8 comparisons for 2005 are possible after Canada and Japan gave data this week. "The main driver for emissions has not been the Kyoto Protocol but how economies have been developing," said Keywan Riahi, a senior researcher at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. Economic growth and rising populations tend to spur emissions from factories, power plants and cars but energy efficiency, partly inspired by Kyoto, and a shift away from heavy industry towards services are among brakes for G8 nations. Among big shifts, Russian emissions are up 7.3 percent since 2000, mainly driven by an economic rebound after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its smokestack industries. But Russia is still 28.7 percent below 1990 levels. Bush said in 2001 that Kyoto would threaten U.S. jobs and wrongly excluded developing nations from first targets of a 5 percent cut by 2008-12. He prefers voluntary agreements and investments in new technologies, such as hydrogen or clean coal. "My personal view is that the importance of Kyoto was not for the actual emissions reductions it may achieve -- which are tiny compared with what is needed -- but rather that Kyoto was a first attempt to build a global consensus and commitment," Raupach said. "In that, it has been less than fully successful," he said. Merkel wants Bush to agree to Kyoto-style caps, with extra urgency after U.N. climate reports this year have said world emissions will need to be cut to help avert more hunger, water shortages, heatwaves and rising seas. The White House said last week that preliminary data showed that U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, fell by 1.3 percent in 2006. "We are effectively confronting the important challenge of global climate change," Bush said. Raupach said, however, that a warm winter contributed to cut U.S. heating demand and a less than scorching 2005 summer had also curbed use of air conditioning. news is provided by Zoom to full size map UN resumes aid to drought-stricken Uganda region EXCLUSIVE-Russia in talks to build gas pipeline to China EXCLUSIVE-Russia in talks to build gas pipeline to China INSTANT VIEW-Reaction to Bush on climate change TABLE-Greenhouse gas cuts needed and G8 pledges so far Catholic Relief Services commends President's call to double PEPFAR funding Source: CRS - USA World Vision Lauds Bush Global AIDS Funding Proposal Source: WV - USA ACT Alert: Indonesia tidal waves displace thousands Source: ACT - Switzerland Put food at the heart of the fight against HIV and Aids or fail, warn leading aid agencies Source: CARE International - UK Catholic Relief Services urges Congress to preserve US long-term development food aid initiatives that fight chronic hunger Source: CRS - USA A drought is seen in a village a year after being flooded by mud in Sidoarjo, in Indonesia's East Java province, May 29, 2007.

She was arrested Feb. 12 while driving away from a fast-food restaurant in Wheaton, 20 miles west of Chicago. Three of her children were inside her 1996 Ford van when someone called police to report a suspected intoxicated driver, authorities have said. Banaszewski refused to take a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month suspension of her driver's license which she didn't contest in March. A DuPage County judge also sentenced Banaszewski to work 140 hours of public service and attend counseling sessions, according to Paul Darrah, a spokesman for the DuPage County state's attorney's office. Banaszewski's attorney, Donald Ramsell, said the plea agreement was fair to both sides. Scalia, who began serving on the Supreme Court in 1986, has nine children.

Guards at the U.S. Naval Base in southeast Cuba found the detainee in his cell unresponsive and not breathing Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. military&#39;s Southern Command said in a statement. "They tried to save his life, but he was pronounced dead, " said Mario Alvarez, a spokesman for the command. It would be the fourth suicide at Guantanamo since the prison camp opened in January 2002. On June 10, 2006, two Saudi detainees and one Yemeni hanged themselves with sheets. Details, including the prisoner&#39;s name and manner of death, were not released. A spokesman for detention operations, Navy Cmdr. Rick Haupt, declined to comment, referring questions to the Southern Command, based in Miami. The death came as the U.S. military prepared to try two detainees, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni, and Omar Khadr, a Canadian. Their arraignment is scheduled to proceed Monday at Guantanamo as planned, Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon, a Pentagon spokesman, said late Wednesday. Khadr fired his American attorneys on Wednesday, leaving him without defense counsel as his arraignment approaches, his former U.S. military attorney said. "He doesn&#39;t trust American lawyers, and I don&#39;t particularly blame him, " said U.S. Marine Lt. Col. Colby Vokey, who was taken off the case Wednesday. "The United States is responsible for his interrogation and his treatment under a process that is patently unfair." The military toughened security at the prison camp after the previous suicides and an uprising last spring, taking measures to remove access to light fixtures and other possible makeshift weapons. About 380 men are held at the prison camp . The Naval Criminal Investigative Service is conducting an investigation into the three previous suicides.

Putin has issued an acerbic warning to the United States, saying the recent test of a new Russian missile was a direct response to US actions and condemning "imperialism" in world affairs. President Vladimir Putin issued an acerbic warning Friday to the United States, saying the recent test of a new Russian missile was a direct response to US actions and condemning "imperialism" in world affairs. "Our American partners have quit the ABM Treaty," Putin told reporters after meeting his Greek counterpart, referring to the landmark 1972 US-Soviet treaty limiting the missile defenses of the Cold War superpower foes. "We warned them then that we would come out with a response to maintain the strategic balance in the world. Yesterday we conducted a test of a new strategic ballistic missile with multiple warheads, and of a new cruise missile, and will continue to improve our resources." The United States informed Russia in 2001 that it was exercising its option to withdraw unilaterally from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) pact. It has since stepped up controversial plans, fiercely opposed by Russia, to deploy a missile defence shield in eastern Europe. Putin warned Wednesday that the US missile defense plan would turn Europe into a "powder keg" and he repeated on Thursday previous assertions that the planned deployments would ignite a new Cold War-style arms buildup. "We are not the initiators of this new round of the arms race," Putin said. The Russian president's comments came a week before he meets US President George W. Bush and other leaders of the Group of Eight (G8) industrialised nations at a summit in Germany. He is also scheduled to hold one-on-one talks with Bush in the United States at the beginning of July. In a thinly disguised attack on US foreign policy in recent years, Putin warned there had been attempts by actors -- he did not name any country or bloc explicitly -- in international affairs to impose their will on others. "In our view, it is nothing other than diktat, than imperialism," the Russian leader stated. "Problems have arisen because the world changed and there was an attempt to make it unipolar. There was a desire among several international actors to dictate their will to each and everyone and to act not in accordance with the norms of international life and law," Putin said. He added: "This is very dangerous and unhealthy. The norms of international law have been altered for political expediency. What is this political expediency and who defines it?" Tensions between Russia and the United States have risen dramatically in the past year amid sharpening differences over the US missile plans, the state of democracy in Russia and concerns over energy supplies. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice repeated on Wednesday the US assertion that the planned missile defense system in eastern Europe poses no threat to Russia and that Moscow's concern over it is "ludicrous." Her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, countered at a meeting of G8 foreign ministers outside Berlin that "there is nothing ludicrous about this issue because the arms race is starting again."

Bush wants him dead. "Oh, my goodness," White House press secretary Tony Snow said at a news conference when asked about Castro&#039;s comments. Prompted to elaborate on whether the Bush administration is concerned, Snow added: "It&#039;s Fidel Castro." He said nothing more on the subject. The 80-year-old Castro, who has not been seen in public since becoming ill more than 10 months ago, said in an editorial published Tuesday on the front page of the Communist Party daily Granma that Bush was waiting for him to die but could not kill his ideas. "I&#039;m not the first, nor will I be the last, who Bush has ordered to be deprived of life," Castro wrote. Bush urges 15 major countries set global emission goal by 2008 Zoellick has new agenda for World Bank Bush calls on Congress to increase funds for fighting AIDS Called "Reflections of the Commander in Chief," the Cuban leader&#039;s opinion pieces are becoming an almost-daily staple in Granma. Also Tuesday, Castro lambasted Bush for opposing the European Union&#039;s goal for an agreement on carbon emissions at next week&#039;s Group of Eight summit, and criticized both Britain and the United States for heavy military expenditures. Castro shocked Cuba on July 31 when he announced that he had undergone emergency intestinal surgery and was stepping aside provisionally for his younger brother Raul, the defense minister, during his recovery. Although senior Cuban officials have said Castro is on the mend, it seems more unlikely with time that the bearded leader will return to power. In one of his essays earlier this month, Castro offered a few new details about illness, saying that he had numerous operations and that the first procedure did not go well. Castro&#039;s exact ailment and condition remain state secrets, but he is widely believed to suffer from diverticular disease, which causes sacs in the colon that can become inflamed and bleed. Snow&#039;s comments came after U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recently accused Cuba of trying to impose a non-democratic transition of power, and criticized Spain for commercial and economic ties that she said are not helping to bring democracy to the Caribbean island. She said Cuba would be "one of the most important" topics of discussion during a meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luiz Rodriguez Zapatero in Madrid, the last stop on her European tour.

Lee, who served as Taiwanese president from 1988 to 2000, arrived in Japan on Wednesday. He has been a strong critic of Beijing, which claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan more than five decades after the two sides split during a civil war. The mainland has threatened war if the island takes steps to make its de facto independence permanent. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said the purpose of Lee's visit was to push for Taiwanese independence and undermine China-Japan relations. "We express our strong dissatisfaction toward the Japan government for allowing Lee Teng-hui to go to Japan for those activities," Jiang said at a regular news briefing. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stressed that Lee's visit is private and that he did not expect it to hurt Tokyo's relations with Beijing. Ties have been frayed by disputes over exploitation of underwater gas and oil deposits, territory, and interpretation of history, but a visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to Japan in April helped ease their differences. Jiang suggested that support for Taiwan's independence could damage the warming relations. "To properly handle the Taiwan question and historical issues is the basic condition for the healthy development of our bilateral ties," she said. Japan has official diplomatic relations with Beijing, but not with Taiwan. China regularly opposes visits by Taiwanese officials to countries with which it has diplomatic ties. Lee's office has said the 11-day trip will focus on visits to Japanese cultural sites. His itinerary, however, also includes speeches and a news conference. Lee has said he will visit the Yasukuni war shrine, which is vilified by Japan's neighbors, especially China and the Koreas, for symbolizing the country's militaristic past. Lee has a brother enshrined at the Tokyo shrine, which deifies Japan's 2.5 million war dead &mdash; including executed Class-A war criminals &mdash; along with tens of thousands of Koreans and Taiwanese who were drafted into Japan's military.

The 64-year-old, who joins a crowded field of Republican contenders, told newspaper USA Today about his campaign plans, ending months of speculation. He is already well known for his role as a district attorney in TV series Law & Order, and has been polling well. Mr Thompson is expected to launch a "testing the waters" committee in the next few days to start fundraising. The former two-term senator for Tennessee has already been hiring staff, making speeches and setting up a strong internet presence. Reports began circulating on Wednesday that he had decided to make official his informal but already attention-grabbing initiatives towards running for president. "I can't remember exactly the point I said, 'I'm going to do this'," Mr Thompson told USA Today in an interview published on Thursday. "But when I did, that thing that occurred to me: 'I'm going to tell people that I'm thinking about it and see what kind of reaction I get to it'." Mr Thompson has already been attracting attention with speeches He told the paper that his late start to campaigning carried "certain advantages", not least that his use of the internet "has allowed me to be in the hunt, so to speak, without spending a dime". Observers say he could pose a threat to all three of the main contenders for the Republican nomination, Senator John McCain, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Some polls have put him at second or third place among potential Republican voters struggling to decide who to back in a field of almost a dozen candidates. He has strong conservative credentials on issues such as gun control and abortion and, while he voted in 2002 to authorise the Iraq invasion, he is not as closely associated with the war as some of his rivals. His charisma and ability to perform for the crowds are expected to stand him in good stead on the campaign trail. Inevitably, parallels have been drawn between Mr Thompson and another actor-turned-politician, Ronald Reagan. The actor has asked to leave Law & Order, where he has played the astute, fatherly New York District Attorney Arthur Branch for the past five seasons, in order to concentrate on politics. He is also known to viewers for roles in the films The Hunt for Red October, in which he played a US Navy admiral, Last Best Chance and In the Line of Fire.

First Read is updated throughout the day, so check back often. , NBC Political Director , NBC Deputy Political Director Posted: Thursday, May 31, 2007 9:09 AM by Mark Murray The Kansas senator uses the New York Times op-ed page to explain why he was one of three candidates to raise his hand during the first GOP debate to announce that he does not believe in evolution. "The premise behind the question seems to be that if one does not unhesitatingly assert belief in evolution, then one must necessarily believe that God created the world and everything in it in six 24-hour days. But limiting this question to a stark choice between evolution and creationism does a disservice to the complexity of the interaction between science, faith and reasonâ€¦ If belief in evolution means simply assenting to microevolution, small changes over time within a species, I am happy to say, as I have in the past, that I believe it to be true. If, on the other hand, it means assenting to an exclusively materialistic, deterministic vision of the world that holds no place for a guiding intelligence, then I reject it.â€ : â€œIn a potential preview of next fall's presidential contest, Mr. Giuliani, who is seen as the front-runner for the Republican nomination, directly attacked the leading Democratic candidate, Mrs. Clinton, over a speech she gave Tuesday in New Hampshire bemoaning the return of â€˜robber baronsâ€™ and promising to pursue â€˜shared prosperityâ€™ by increasing taxes on Americans making more than $200,000 a year. â€˜This would be an astounding, staggering tax increase,â€™ Mr. Giuliani told reporters yesterday after a visit to a restaurant on the edge of California's Silicon Valley.â€ New York Daily News notes that Giuliani will today pick up an endorsement from former Bill Clinton FBI director Louis Freeh, who has gone from a one-time Clinton advocate to a sharp critic. There was some World Bank fallout for McCain. The nomination of Bob Zoellick means McCain lost his chief policy adviser, Chris Cillizza of WashingtonPost.com In Des Moines yesterday, the former Massachusetts governor came out swinging against the Democratic presidential front-runners' health plans, NBCâ€™s Lauren Appelbaum notes. "I've watched with interest these last few days, watching the Democrats come out with their plans on health care. They don't understand,â€ Romney said. â€œThe path of Europe is not the way to go. Socialized medicine, Hillary-care, Obama-care, they don't get it. The best way to make health care work is to make health care more like a market and with the dynamics of a public market. That's the way to go." (Given that the Democrats have tailored their health plans, in part, on what Romney did in Massachusetts, how do GOP critics view Romney-care?) was also following around Romney this week (in fact, on the same day as our own Matt Lauer). Concludes Klein: "But there isn't the slightest hint of courage or conviction in his stump act. It's a candidacy for the era before 2001, before things got serious. And his success or failure will be a reflection of how serious the electorate is in 2008." interviews the soon-to-be candidate. â€œHis late start carries some problems but also â€˜certain advantages,â€™ he says. â€˜Nobody has maxed out to meâ€™ in contributions, he notes, and using the Internet already â€˜has allowed me to be in the hunt, so to speak, without spending a dime.â€™â€ More: â€œThompson argues that Republicans lost control of the House and Senate in November not because of the war but because of out-of-control spending and unrestrained partisanship. What's surprising â€” and encouraging for Republicans â€” is that Democrats didn't gain more ground, he says. â€˜It's been kind of a pox on both your houses,â€™ he says. â€˜There's a disconnect out there between the people and Washington. â€¦ It seems lately whoever has power, whoever has control makes the same predictable mistakes.â€™â€ By the way, not every GOP strategist believes Thompson is doing this the right way. GOP pollster Tony Fabrizio, who isn't working for any 2008 presidential candidate, tells the he was â€œsurprised and a little sadâ€ that Mr. Thompson had not declared himself a full-fledged candidate. â€œâ€˜Thompson will be competing against three guys who have been running flat out for months and working their tails off for well over a year,â€™ Mr. Fabrizio said. â€˜If youâ€™re not going to get in this race and double-time on work, effort and commitment, how do you expect to win? You need to send signals that say, â€œIâ€™m here and Iâ€™m going to win.â€â€™â€ A Winthrop/ETV poll finds about 40% of South Carolina Republicans believe Thompson should officially enter the presidential race. And Republicans in also have high interest in the former senator. has a little more detail on his schedule for the next month, which includes a "Tonight Show" appearance sometime in June. NBCâ€™s Natalie Morales spoke yesterday with John Gill, special counsel in the district attorneyâ€™s office in Knox County, TN, who happens to be Thompsonâ€™s friend and former law school classmate. Morales asked if he believes Thompson will indeed run for president. "If I had to bet, I would bet that he would,â€ Gill replied. â€œAnd I would bet that he'd announce very soon. He is very popular in Tennessee." puts a dollar figure on what the 100+ donors pledged to raise on the first day of the campaign, June 4 -- $46,000 each. That translates into approximately $4.6 million. Also, all three GOP front-runners disputed analysis that said THEIR campaign was hurt most by Thompson's entry. Said McCain manager Terry Nelson : â€œâ€˜I don't think that it fundamentally changes the strategy of our campaign, which is to put forward John McCain as a candidate ready to lead from Day One.â€™â€ Romney spokesperson Kevin Madden " the notion that Mr. Thompson might peel away conservative and evangelical voters who Mr. Romney has been courting for months." Madden, noting Romney will be speaking in Tennessee on Saturday: â€˜The governor looks at these events as opportunities â€” it could be a Romney crowd by the end of the night,â€™ Mr. Madden said.â€ And Giuliani adviser Tony Carbonetti "played down any concern in the Giuliani campaign that Mr. Thompson would run strongly among voters who are deeply concerned about national security and want a candidate who is socially conservative as well." Here's what Romney said about Thompson in an interview on Iowa's version of Meet the Press -- . â€œâ€˜I'm probably not a good political pundit to know what is going to happen precisely,â€™ Romney said during the taping of an Iowa Public Television show. â€˜I think he'll make the race more interesting. He's got good ideas and after all, he does put bad people in jail every week on â€œLaw and Order.â€â€™â€ The headline in McCain's hometown newspaper, the : "One-Time Ally Is Set To Compete vs. McCain." compete in the straw poll ? More importantly, if he doesn't and Giuliani also punts, then does the straw poll matter?

Someone one tell brownback he is not in KANSAS anymore! If he only had a BRAIN! He has been so far up shrubs butt he is brown ALL over. This bunch should be running FROM the Presdintial race. (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 9:30 AM) Brownback has been brown-nosing his so-called social conservatives for so long, he's lost the ability to discern when his rhetoric touches on the ridiculous. Either that, or he's an idiot. The question was whether you believe in evolution... and had nothing to do with what forces might be causing evolution. Like I keep telling my eight-year-old, who had a rough go in third grade this year... answer the question that's asked. But my son has an excuse. He's only eight. What's Brownback's excuse? Paul Miller, Woodbridge, VA (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 9:31 AM) So Brownback believes in...? The Creation of Evolution? The Evolution of Creationism? Creative Evoultion? Evolving Creationism?

Steve Turner Cedar Falls Iowa (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 9:54 AM) Brownback realizes how incredibly stupid it appears to not acknowledge evolution of our earth, when the evidence is spread throughout the planet.

Bush is also a believer in this kind of hogwash. The ten clones of Bush running for his job are precisely what America does not need, after the debacle of the Bush Regime has ended. The pathetic attempts of Brownback, to backpedal and attempt to paint himself as less than a religious zealot, are wholly unsuccessful. Run from this guy (and the other 9 who are virtually indistinguishable from one another....and more to the point, are copies of George W. Bush). Coy Reese, Shady Spring, West Virgina (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 10:26 AM) If his hand was up for the evolution question, do America a favor and vote for one of the other guys. Enough with this stupidity. We have a hard enough time maintaining world respect without this constant annoying and false "debate" overshadowing science. Evolution, however you want to say it was directed to adhere to your faith, happened. Don't be an idiot. Stop making us look like idiots. (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 11:07 AM) That would be impossible Andrew. So many idiots we have no choices. God must love idiots, he made so many of them.

VOA national correspondent Jim Malone has more from Washington. Republican presidential hopefuls former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, left, embraces former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as Senator John McCain walks by after the Republican debate, 15 May 2007 In the latest debate held in South Carolina and televised by the Fox News Channel, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani may have helped himself with a statement on the 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. Giuliani responded to a comment from Texas Congressman Ron Paul about the roots of the 9/11 attacks. Paul is the only Republican candidate who opposes the war in Iraq. "They attack us because we have been over there. We have been bombing Iraq for 10 years. We have been in the Middle East. I think [former President Ronald] Reagan was right. We do not understand the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics." "That is an extraordinary statement. As someone who lived through the attack of September 11th, [to say that] we invited the attack, because we were attacking Iraq, I do not think I have ever heard that before. And I have heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th." There were other examples of a more aggressive tone among the Republican contenders. Arizona Senator John McCain was asked about his opposition to torture in the questioning of terrorism suspects and his vow to close the terrorist detention camp at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. "The use of torture, as much as we would gain from torture, we would lose in world opinion," said Senator McCain. "We do not torture people." Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney also opposed the use of torture to obtain information about an impending terrorist attack. But Romney said he would favor keeping the Guantanamo Bay prison open and doubling the number of terrorist suspects held there. Former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore said some of the frontrunners in the Republican field are trying to portray themselves as more conservative than they actually are. Gilmore cited Giuliani's support for abortion rights and the fact that Romney was once a supporter of abortion, but now opposes it. Gilmore also noted that McCain initially opposed President Bush's tax cut program. Gilmore also repeated concerns about Iran that several of the Republican contenders expressed in their earlier debate in California. "There is no choice at this point other than to join up with people across the world in order to put on serious, mandatory sanctions against Iran," he said. Another of the lesser known Republican contenders, Colorado Congressman Tom Tancredo, accused Giuliani, McCain and Romney of being weak on the issue of stopping illegal immigration into the U.S. University of Virginia political analyst Larry Sabato said the second Republican debate demonstrated a new willingness on the part of several candidates to challenge each other. "They have not been attacking one another until tonight, and this time they decided to unsheathe the short knives," he said. "They went after each other, at least a bit and they drew some blood. I think McCain was bleeding a bit, I think Romney was bleeding a bit. Some of the minor candidates [as well], but they do not matter." Public-opinion polls show Giuliani in the lead for the Republican nomination, followed by McCain and Romney, with the seven other active candidates trailing far behind. But the polls also show support for two Republicans who are considering a White House run, but who have not declared their candidacies, former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia. Craig Crawford of Congressional Quarterly magazine says none of the Republican candidates has yet captured the imagination of the party's social conservative wing, a crucial constituency in the nominating process. "I think one of the biggest reasons the Republican race is wide open is that no one has a claim on the conservative chair, the social conservative chair in the Republican Party," he explained. Thompson is expected to decide whether to enter the race in the next few weeks while Gingrich says he will make a decision by September.

Meanwhile, US forces backed by helicopter gunship clashed with suspected Al-Qaeda gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. At least 10 policemen were among the dead in the Fallujah attack, which occurred about 11 am, according to police officials. Fallujah, in restive Anbar province, is 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated his explosives vest at the third of four checkpoints as he stood among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only been opened on Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The US military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of tribes that have banded together to fight Al-Qaeda. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of insurgents and Al-Qaeda through the course of the Iraq war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents there called for US help. Members of Al-Qaeda were preventing students from attending final examinations, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. Clashes continued into Thursday afternoon, and the council official said the Al-Qaeda leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the US military. US forces, meanwhile, pressed on Thursday with the search for five kidnapped Britons. A procession of mourners marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a US helicopter strike before dawn. The US military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the attack. It came in the second day of a search for the Britons who were abducted from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad on Tuesday. A US military statement, however, said US forces had arrested two members of a secret cell network on Thursday in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. A police officer in Sadr City said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 am, killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was injured. Also in Sadr City raids, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi said his home was raided and ransacked by US forces at 3 am Thursday. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. The Britons were snatched from a Finance Ministry facility in a mock police raid. The US military late Wednesday reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed in a roadside bombing and one who died of a non-combat cause. Their deaths rose to 119 the number of soldiers killed this month, the third-deadliest month of the war for US troops. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. An Al-Qaeda front group has claimed responsibility. Residents gather near a burnt vehicle after an airstrike by US forces in Baghdad's Sadr City.

Security has been tightened in Bangkok amid fears that supporters of ousted Premier Thaksin Shinawatra may react violently ahead of a tribunal ruling that may disband the country's two largest parties. The constitutional court is due to rule on Wednesday, May 30, 2007 whether the Thai Rak Thai Party of former Prime Minister Thaksin, and its Democrat Party rival, violated election laws in April last year. If found guilty, either or both parties could be dissolved, or their executives barred from public office for five years, or both. (AP Photo/Apichart Weerawong) BANGKOK, Thailand - A court ruled Wednesday that the country's oldest political party was not guilty of maligning ousted Premier Thaksin Shinawatra and urging voters to cast a "no" vote in last year's election. The ruling was the first of six charges the Constitutional Tribunal is considering against the Democrat Party. It then will consider similar election law violations against Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party. A guilty finding could result in either the parties or their executives being banned from politics. The party is "not guilty of maligning Thaksin's party Thak Rak Thai and persuading people to vote no," a judge read out to the crowded courtroom. "It did not mislead voters about Thaksin's popularity as the election commission alleged."

Security Council and freeze uranium enrichment, saying Washington was ready for wide-ranging talks if it complied. "I think it&#039;s time for Iran to change its tactics," Rice told reporters in Vienna, Austria, where she was attending a conference on the role of women in the Middle East. If Iran does so, she said, "then we are prepared to ... sit with Iran and talk about whatever Iran would like to talk about. "But that can&#039;t be done when Iran continues to pursue, to try to perfect technologies that are going to lead to a nuclear weapon," Rice said, alluding to U.S. assertion that Tehran was seeking the cover of a peaceful nuclear program to make such arms. With both sides voicing hardline positions, the talks on Thursday between ranking Iranian nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani and Javier Solana, the EU&#039;s senior foreign policy representative, were unlikely to make substantial headway. Diplomats told The Associated Press that, although Tehran recently suggested it was ready to discuss a partial suspension of uranium enrichment, the West rejected the overture and Iran has withdrawn its offer to break the nuclear impasse. Russian denies involvement in Litvinenko killing Bicycle programs catching on in major cities Europe leads in designing buildings that save energy "Suspension is not the right solution for solving Iran&#039;s nuclear issue," the Iranian state news agency quoted Larijani as saying before leaving for Spain. On arrival in Madrid on Wednesday, he obliquely blamed the U.S. and its Western allies for their insistence on a full freeze, referring to "some mischievous moves by some countries." In Vienna, Rice said Iran had no option but to "suspend, to demonstrate that it is in fact not seeking a nuclear weapon under cover of (a) civil nuclear power" program. "The question isn&#039;t why won&#039;t we talk to Tehran, the question is why doesn&#039;t Tehran want to talk to us," she said, when asked whether it was time for Washington to rethink its insistence on full suspension. A year ago, she reached out dramatically to longtime adversary Iran with an offer to talk "anytime, any place," which was intended to inject new life into an ebbing European diplomatic effort to turn back Iran&#039;s advancing nuclear program. Iran did not accept Rice&#039;s offer for the first Cabinet-level direct talks in nearly three decades, because of the condition to stop enriching uranium. There is a growing perception among some European nations that the five permanent U.N. Security Council nations plus Germany &#8212; the powers in the forefront of attempts to engage Iran &#8212; should drop their full suspension precondition to talks starting on a package of incentives. At talks last month in Ankara, Turkey, both Larijani and Solana agreed to meet again to try to bridge the divide between Iran&#039;s insistence on its right to enrich and Security Council demands for a freeze. Before that meeting, Iran suggested it was ready to stop some of its centrifuge machines, which can enrich uranium to the low level used to generate power and to high-grade material used in the fissile core of nuclear warheads, said one of the diplomats, who demanded anonymity for revealing confidential information. But the U.S. and Security Council allies Britain and France continued to insist on full suspension, and another diplomat said that at the Ankara meeting, Larijani suddenly changed tack, saying Iran was no longer interested in a partial and temporary suspension. "It was clear that those on the Western side did not accept any centrifuges (running) at all," said the first diplomat. "As a result, the Iranians have gone completely hardline." Diplomats said evidence of that surfaced at a meeting Friday in Brussels between Larijani&#039;s deputy, Javed Vaidi, and senior civil servants of Britain, France and Germany who report directly to their foreign ministers. Also present was a senior Solana aide. "It was a disaster," said the first diplomat, adding the two sides parted with no signs of progress on the issue. Although Iran insists it has the right to the technology to generate nuclear power, it has been hit with two sets of U.N. sanctions because of suspicions bred by nearly two decades of Tehran&#039;s clandestine nuclear activities. Rice, in Vienna, said that while the Security Council stood ready to freeze further punitive actions, "Iran has not been willing to take the other half of that bargain" by agreeing to a full suspension of enrichment. Iran&#039;s ultimate stated goal is running 54,000 centrifuges to churn out enriched uranium. That would be enough for dozens of nuclear warheads a year.

Market Sensitive Global News Suicide Bombing At Police Recruitment Center Kills At Least 20 Iraqis [] 5/31/2007 8:10:18 AM A suicide bomber wearing an explosives vest attacked a police recruitment centre in the Iraqi city of Falluja, killing at least 20 people and wounding dozens, Iraqi police said on Thursday. Police said the bomber had passed through several checkpoints before detonating the device among a crowd of police recruits. Following co-operation between US and Iraqi forces and a grouping of Sunni Arab tribes called the Anbar Salvation Council, the police recruitment centre had only opened on Saturday. The Sunni Arab tribes had come together last year in an attempt to fight al-Qaeda elements in Anbar province. Falluja which lies west of Baghdad in Anbar province, an area that has seen some of the fiercest fighting between US and Iraqi forces and Sunni Arab insurgents is one of the key battlegrounds in the insurgency. No Breakthrough As Search Goes On For Abducted Britons In Iraq [] 5/31/2007 4:23:43 AM There has been no breakthrough in the efforts to trace five Britons abducted by suspected radical Shiite Mahdi Army militia from the heavily guarded Iraqi Finance Ministry complex in the Sadr City suburb on Tuesday. Speaking at the G8 summit in Berlin, Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said the situation remained "quite unclear", but reiterated that "everything possible" was being done to secure their release and families of the abducted men were being kept informed of any progress. Among those seized were a business consultant and his four bodyguards. The abduction is suspected to be in retaliation for the killing by British forces last week of the militia's commander in Basra. On Wednesday, US and Iraqi troops cordoned off parts of the city close to where the kidnapping occurred and carried out raids. Though the US military said that some militants were arrested, it did not confirm whether the raids were related to the abducted Britons.

Mr Putin said it was a "response to maintain the strategic balance in the world", in what he called a "new round of the arms race". He added that Russia would continue to improve its resources. Russia tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile, which can be armed with up to 10 warheads, on Tuesday. These actions by Russia should not be feared, they are not aggressive Europe diary: Missile defence "Our American partners have left the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty," Mr Putin told a press conference. "We have warned them then that we will come out with a response to maintain the strategic balance in the world." Mr Putin defended Russia's actions, insisting they were not the "initiators of this new round of the arms race". "(Our partners) are stuffing Eastern Europe with new weapons," he said. "A new base in Bulgaria, another in Romania, a site in Poland, radar in the Czech Republic. What are we supposed to do? We cannot just observe all this." He added: "These actions by Russia should not be feared, they are not aggressive, it's just an answer to rather tough and unjustified unilateral actions by partners." Washington wants to deploy interceptor rockets in Poland and a radar base in the Czech Republic to counter what it describes as a potential threat from "rogue states" such as Iran and North Korea. The US maintains its system is not directed at the Russians, but Moscow says its security is being threatened. Russia's test launch took place at the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia on 29 May. The missile, called RS-24, was designed to evade missile defence systems, the Russian defence ministry says. The test missile successfully struck its target 5,500km (3,400 miles) away on the far eastern Kamchatka peninsula, the Russian Strategic Missile Forces said.

Senior officials Thursday morning attended an urgent meeting called by Bangkok police chief Pol. Lt-Gen. Adisorn Nonsi after learning that members and supporters of the disbanded TRT planned to organize a major demonstration after the party was disbanded by the Constitution Tribunal late Wednesday, according to the Thai News Agency. Thai Rak Thai and three small political parties were dissolved by the ruling of the Constitution Tribunal after being found guilty of electoral fraud in the April 2, 2006 general election which was later declared null and void. The TRT party's 111 executives were banned from politics for five years. Security personnel manning the checkpoints established in areas served by the capital's 88 police stations will question suspicious private vehicle drivers and passengers, as well as taxi and motorcycle taxi drivers, after police received intelligence reports that members and supporters of TRT planned to rally Thursday afternoon.

Turkish soldiers stand guard at a checkpoint near the southeast Turkish town of Cizre, some 60 km (37 miles) from Turkey's Habur border gate to Iraq, May 29, 2007. [Reuters] A group of 20 tanks loaded on trucks emerged from army barracks in Mardin near Syria and headed towards the Iraqi border in southeast Turkey, already the scene of a major army offensive against rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Speculation about an imminent incursion into Iraq has grown since Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said last week he saw eye to eye with the army over possible military action, despite unease in the United States, Turkey's NATO ally, about such a move. There was also anxiety along the border in southeast Turkey, where many Kurdish villagers form part of a state-backed militia which fights alongside the army against the PKK rebels. "We support the operations in the mountains here because the PKK made us suffer a lot. I lost 10 people from my family," said Nadir Karadeniz, an official in the village of Gorumlu, located near a military base just a few kilometers from the border. But there was reluctance to take the fight into the Iraqi mountains, where thousands of PKK fighters are based, given the strong opposition from Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani - a respected figure among Turkey's own Kurds. "I don't think it would be good to go into northern Iraq because Barzani said he would not accept Turkish soldiers there," Karadeniz said, before a military jeep arrived in the village and told journalists to leave the area. Military operations are currently focused on the rebels already inside Turkish territory. Security forces killed 10 PKK fighters in clashes across the southeast on Tuesday. The United States has repeatedly urged Turkey not to send troops into Iraq because it says it will only complicate the situation. The two countries have agreed various measures, including financial ones, to try to curb the PKK.

The U.S. military said only one policeman was killed and eight were wounded. U.S. forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al-Qaida gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. The American military also reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed Wednesday in a roadside bombing in Baghdad and one who died of wounds from a roadside bomb attack northwest of the capital Tuesday. At least 122 American forces have died in May, the third-deadliest month of the Iraq conflict. U.S. forces also continued a search for five Britons who were kidnapped Tuesday in Baghdad, as well as for two of its soldiers who have been missing since a May 12 ambush south of the capital. The Fallujah suicide bomber killed at least 10 policemen in the attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. The rest of the dead were civilians, many of them in line seeking jobs as policemen. He said as many as 50 were wounded. Fallujah General Hospital had received 15 bodies and 10 wounded, according to a doctor there, who would not allow the use of his name because he feared retribution. The physician said he believed other casualties were taken to the nearby Jordanian Hospital and private clinics. A member of the Fallujah city council, who also asked for anonymity for fear of attack by insurgents, said there were at least 20 killed and 25 injured. The coordination of information in Fallujah was particularly difficult because the mobile telephone system has been working only sporadically. Maj. Jeff Pool of the Multi-National Force-West said the Anbar province governor's office and the provincial police put the total number of dead at one Iraqi policeman, with six police and two civilians wounded in Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated explosives in his vest at the third of four checkpoints, standing among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only opened Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The U.S. military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaida. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of Sunni insurgents and al-Qaida throughout the war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents called for U.S. help. Members of al-Qaida, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final exams, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from al-Qaida. Clashes continued into the afternoon, and the council official said the al-Qaida leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the U.S. military. U.S. forces, meanwhile, pressed on with the search for five kidnapped Britons, and a procession of mourners, some of them women wailing and beating their chests, marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a U.S. helicopter strike before dawn. The U.S. military said it had no report of airstrikes in Sadr City and that there were no civilian casualties in the second day of a search for the Britons, who were abducted Tuesday from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad. A U.S. military statement, however, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. AP Television News videotape from Sadr City showed the coffins of the victims atop a small bus with men and women walking behind, crying. A young boy could be seen sitting next to the coffins. A car in the area was punctured with big holes, as if hit by an airstrike. A police officer in Sadr City, who refused to allow use of his name because he feared retribution, said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 a.m., killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home , a common practice in Iraq's extreme heat through late spring and summer. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was wounded. Also in Sadr City raids, which the U.S. has been conducting with a select unit of Iraqi army forces, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi claimed his home was raided and ransacked by American forces at 3 a.m. Thursday. The military said it had no report of the incident. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. Dozens of U.S. Humvees and Bradley fighting vehicles had taken up positions around Sadr City at nightfall Wednesday. The five kidnapped Britons included four bodyguards working for the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld and one employee of BearingPoint, a U.S.-based management consulting firm. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. The Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, claimed responsibility. Wiggins also said that more than 100 patrols a day were being launched to search for two missing troops who vanished after a May 12 ambush near Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. Four Americans and one Iraqi soldier were killed in the attack and the body of another American was later found in the Euphrates River. "Our determination and resolve to locate our missing soldiers is unwavering," Wiggins said.

George was an aboriginal protester shot and killed by Ontario police at Ipperwash Provincial Park in 1995 when police moved in to break up a land-claim protest. A provincial inquiry was held and commissioner Sidney Linden's report is expected to conclude whether or not former Ontario premier Mike Harris influenced the police response. The report is also expected to offer sugestions on how to avoid bloodshed in similar occupations in the future. - AM 640 Toronto 24 Hour Newscentre Ipperwash Inquiry Blames ex-Premier and Police for Death of Protester Offer on the Table For Six Nations Public Health Hoping E-Cards will Stem STD's Mt.

US Willing To Enter Into Dialogue With Tehran [] 5/31/2007 6:02:53 AM Despite Tehran reiterating a number of times that it will not enter into any talks with preconditions and that it will not halt its nuclear enrichment, the US said on Thursday that Washington was ready to change its 27 years of US policy to start "wide-ranging" talks if Tehran agreed to heed to UN Security Council and suspend uranium enrichment. Speaking on the sidelines of an international women's empowerment conference in Vienna, before nuclear talks between senior Iranian and EU negotiators, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said it was time for "Iran to change its tactics." If Iran does so, she said, "then we are prepared to ... sit with Iran and talk about whatever Iran would like to talk about." "The question is not, why we don't talk to Iran but why Iran does not talk to us," Rice said. She insisted Iran had to suspend uranium enrichment before sanctions imposed UN Security Council could be lifted. South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary Proposal Defeated At IWC Meeting [] 5/31/2007 4:03:57 AM Latin American proposals for a South Atlantic whale sanctuary, which would have ensured whale protection extended northwards from the existing Southern Ocean sanctuary, have been defeated in the first vote at the International Whaling Commission's meeting at Alaska this year. Delegates at the meeting supported the proposal by a margin of 39 to 29, which however fell short of the three-quarters majority required. Japan, Norway, Denmark and many Caribbean and African countries voted against the proposal. Latin American countries who have been trying to establish a sanctuary in the south Atlantic have expressed their disappointment at the vote. Argentina's whaling commissioner Eduardo Iglesias said: "We are very sad because we are trying to emphasize the needs of many coastal communities in Brazil, in Uruguay, Argentina, even South Africa, but they are not respected here with this decision." Meanwhile, Denmark has scaled down a controversial plan to boost subsistence whaling by Greenland Inuits while a discussion on Japan's plans for limited commercial hunting will continue which would see Japanese coastal communities allowed to hunt a small minke whale each year, with the meat being sold locally. However, anti-whaling countries view the proposal as a breach of the 21-year moratorium on commercial whaling.

Fred Thompson of Tennessee is about to take a big step toward a formal presidential campaign, a move that will shake up the unsettled Republican field and throw a wild card into the competition for the GOP's conservative core. This week, Thompson asked supporters to begin collecting campaign donations on June 4, after he files papers with the Federal Election Commission to establish a political committee to "test the waters" for a White House bid. The move is the clearest signal to date that Thompson, best-known for playing a gruff district attorney on Law & Order, is shelving his reluctance to join the race. He has been urged by friends and conservatives to run and fill a perceived void on the right flank of the Republican candidate field. After weighing a bid for months, Thompson announced in a Tuesday conference call with about 75 potential donors that he was about to establish his formal fundraising committee, Friends of Fred Thompson. Donors listening in on the call, dubbed the "first-day founders," were encouraged to raise about $50,000 each. Thompson has been keeping a high profile in conservative circles and preparing behind the scenes to launch a campaign. He has gathered a cadre of senior advisers that includes Ken Rietz, a former political director of the Republican National Committee; and Michael Toner, former chairman of the FEC. On Saturday, he will speak at a major Republican Party event in Virginia known as the Commonwealth Gala. He addressed a conservative group in Orange County, Calif., in early May, but his speech was panned by some conservative commentators as lackluster.

David Ramsay, Minister of Natural Resources and Aboriginal Affairs, announced the formation of an Ipperwash response team to implement the recommendations of Commissioner Sidney Linden in his inquiry report released Thursday. Mr. Ramsay said this was a &ldquo;turning point&rdquo; for the province, which will benefit all Ontarians. &ldquo;The message is clear. Only by working together can we achieve the common goal of prosperity and equal opportunity for Aboriginal people across this province,&rdquo; Mr. Ramsay said. Sept. 7, 1995. A spray painted sign at Ipperwash Provincial Park reflects Natives' anger about the 1995 confrontation that left protester Anthony O'Brien (Dudley) George dead. (The Globe and Mail) Sam George comments on findings Dudley George's brother speaks with reporters following the release of Thursday's report Inquiry Commissioner Sidney Linden speaks Inquiry Commissioner speaks with reporters from Forest, Ont. Report a road map to unity, peace, aboriginal leaders say Murray Klippenstein on the Ipperwash Inquiry Report Bob Runciman on the Ipperwash Inquiry Report Storm of scandal to finally clear In the 1433-page report, Commissioner Linden offered a scathing review of Ontario Provincial Police operations on the night 38-year-old Dudley George was shot at Ipperwash Provincial Park. He apportions blame to federal and provincial governments as well as the OPP for the stand-off, and makes 98 recommendations that he hopes will help all peoples reach a path of healing. Minutes before the provincial apology, Dudley George's older brother Sam said he was hoping for an apology from Mike Harris, who was Premier at the time. Failing that, he said it was fitting for the province to apologize for him. &ldquo;What Mr. Harris did was act too fast, and closed off many options including negotiations, communications,&rdquo; Mr. George said. &ldquo;We hold him partially responsible for what happened, because of that acting too fast. &ldquo;We wonder if it might be appropriate at this time for Mr. Harris to apologize to my family, or maybe, if Mr. Harris chooses not to, for the government of Ontario to do so. Maybe that is not too much to ask.&rdquo; But Peter Donard, lawyer for Mr. Harris, immediately rejected calls for an apology. &ldquo;This commissioner has made it clear that no apology is required,&rdquo; Mr. Donard said in a testy exchange with reporters. &ldquo;As far as Mr. Harris is concerned, this commission has found specifically in the report that there's no evidence to suggest that either Premier Harris or any member of his government is responsible for the death of Dudley George.&rdquo; Prime among the report recommendations is a call to establish a stand-alone Aboriginal Affairs Ministry within the provincial cabinet, with adequate resources, and for the Federal Government to publicly apologize to the people of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation for failing to honour its promise to return its land. He also urged the creation of a treaty commission of Ontario to settle land and treaty claims, an Aboriginal Reconciliation Fund, more federal involvement with land claim disputes, and new regulations under the Police Services Act to ensure all government directions are in writing and made public to the Commissioner. Judge Linden calls for the OPP to make a public apology to Cecil Bergard George for the beating he sustained in the parking lot where Mr. George was fatally shot by police officer Ken Deane. But in his report, Judge Linden says the matter goes well beyond Mr. Deane and the Inspector who sent him in at 11 p.m. along with a riot squad and other specialist officers. The OPP as an institution also needs to be accountable and share responsibility for the tragedy, as does the Federal Government, he says. &ldquo;Unfortunately, the issues that were at the heart of the Ipperwash occupation remain unresolved by the federal government to this day. This inexcusable delay and long neglect, by successive federal governments, are at the heart of the Ipperwash story.&rdquo; Politically, the hotbed that was Queens Park after the 1995 election played a substantial role in proceedings by Lake Huron that night. Judge Linden found that Premier Mike Harris or someone in his office did convene a meeting on the evening of Sept. 6, 1995, commonly referred to as &ldquo;the dining room meeting&rdquo;. While he found that Mr. Harris did make the controversial comment that he &ldquo;wanted the fucking Indians out of the park&rdquo;, he questions exactly when that comment was made. It was Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson who said the same phrase the &ldquo;dining room meeting&rdquo;, Judge Linden said. The report also finds that Mr. Harris knew at least one person at the meeting was a seconded OPP officer, and that by the end of the meeting &ldquo;Premier Harris had made it clear he wanted the occupiers out of the park as quickly as possible.&rdquo; The Premier's comments in the dining room, and the speed at which he wanted a resolution, &ldquo;unduly narrowed the scope of the government's response&rdquo; and &ldquo;closed off many options endorsed by civil servants,&rdquo; Judge Linden said. And the Premier's push to have an immediate injunction and to remove the Indians from the park within 24 hours was inappropriate. &ldquo;It is for the police to decide whether and when arrests will be made.&rdquo; All of that &ldquo;created the risk of placing political pressure on the police&rdquo; when, in contrast, &ldquo;the Premier could have urged patience, rather than speed&rdquo;. But he concluded that the sum of those factors did not equate to political interference. &ldquo;In my view, although Premier Harris was critical of the police, I do not find that he interfered with or gave inappropriate directions to the police at Ipperwash,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;The Premier did not inappropriately direct the OPP on its operations at Ipperwash or enter the law enforcement domain of the police.&rdquo; The Commissioner confirms that the natives were unarmed, and that Premier Harris and Attorney-General Charles Harnick misled the legislature about the &ldquo;dining room meeting&rdquo;. Julian Falconer, the lawyer representing Aboriginal Legal Services at the inquiry, said the report was &ldquo;historical&rdquo; in that Judge Linden rejected some of Mr. Harris' testimony. &ldquo;It is absolutely unprecedented for a commissioner to make a finding that expressly finds that both the premier and the attorney general misled the house about the key dining room meeting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is a startling revelation and it is unprecedented that I know of for a commissioner to reject evidence under oath by a then premier.&rdquo; The actions of the Ontario Provincial Police were viewed scathingly by Judge Linden, whose references to &ldquo;critical failures&rdquo; on the night of Dudley George's shooting are wearyingly regular. Negotiators should have been called in first. Crowd Management Unit should not have been deployed at night. And, most importantly, the protesters should have been told that they were safe inside the fence. The police had no intention of entering the park. &ldquo;The CMU were busy yelling commands to each other when the officers should have been yelling these crucial messages to the Aboriginal people,&rdquo; Judge Linden wrote. Ontario Provincial Police lawyer Mark Sandler said the Ipperwash standoff was a catalyst for significant change within the force and that the OPP is one of the most progressive police services in the world in terms of aboriginal issues and policies. &ldquo;The OPP came to this inquiry a very different police force than it was 12 years ago,&rdquo; Mr. Sandler said. Judge Linden's criticisms hit upon many of the people mentioned during the Inquiry hearings, including the Premier's executive assistant Deb Hutton. &ldquo;Neither Deb Hutton nor Michael Harris fully appreciated at that time the power of the Premier and the Premier's office,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Regrettably, Ms. Hutton had little experience in aboriginal issues, nor did she have a sound understanding of Aboriginal culture, section 35 of the Constitution, or concepts such as colour of right.&rdquo; In response to the report, Ms. Hutton said the findings &ldquo;conclusively set to rest the unfounded allegations&rdquo; made since Dudley George's death. &ldquo;Commissioner Linden has made clear in his report that there was no political direction of the OPP,&rdquo; she said in a statement issued by her lawyer. As for the land itself, the Commissioner said allowing the status quo to continue is not in anyone's interest. Among the possibilities they could consider, he says, is the reopening of Ipperwash Park under the management of the Kettle Point and Stony Point communities, &ldquo;for the benefit of all Ontarians and visitors alike.&rdquo; On the question of reopening the park, Mr. Ramsay told reporters Thursday: &ldquo;That is not something I've been contemplating, so let's just leave it at that,&rdquo; Mr. Ramsay said.

Moczulski By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent OSLO (Reuters) - Greenhouse gas emissions by leading industrialised nations have accelerated since 2000 and several countries are performing worse than the United States which opposes a U.N. pact for curbing global warming, U.N. data shows. Leaders of the Group of Eight rich nations meet in Germany next week with President George W. Bush resisting pressure by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to agree to cap emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels. But Bush is not alone in presiding over rising emissions. ADVERTISEMENT (article continues below) "Growth rates ... of emissions in the U.S. are slowing," said Michael Raupach, of the Earth Observation Centre in Canberra, Australia, of overall greenhouse gas trends. "European emissions are creeping up in the post-2000 years." National data submitted to the U.N.'s Climate Change Secretariat show that overall emissions by G8 nations rose 2.0 percent from 2000 to 14.3 billion tonnes in 2005 and were up 0.7 percent since 1990, the base year for the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol. Among G8 nations, Russia, Italy and Canada have all had bigger rises than the 1.6 percent U.S. gain since 2000, when Bush won election to the White House. The revival of the Russian economy after the collapse of the Soviet Union is a main spur. Only Britain, Germany and France have cut back since 2000. Since 1990, however, the United States has had a 16.3 percent rise, second worst behind Canada. All G8 nations back Kyoto except the United States, the biggest world emitter. And Kyoto nations expect falls in emissions in coming years when investments, for instance in energy efficiency or wind or hydro power, will take effect. G8 comparisons for 2005 are possible after Canada and Japan gave data this week. "The main driver for emissions has not been the Kyoto Protocol but how economies have been developing," said Keywan Riahi, a senior researcher at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. Economic growth and rising populations tend to spur emissions from factories, power plants and cars but energy efficiency, partly inspired by Kyoto, and a shift away from heavy industry towards services are among brakes for G8 nations. Among big shifts, Russian emissions are up 7.3 percent since 2000, mainly driven by an economic rebound after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its smokestack industries. But Russia is still 28.7 percent below 1990 levels. Bush said in 2001 that Kyoto would threaten U.S. jobs and wrongly excluded developing nations from first targets of a 5 percent cut by 2008-12. He prefers voluntary agreements and investments in new technologies, such as hydrogen or clean coal. "My personal view is that the importance of Kyoto was not for the actual emissions reductions it may achieve -- which are tiny compared with what is needed -- but rather that Kyoto was a first attempt to build a global consensus and commitment," Raupach said. "In that, it has been less than fully successful," he said. Merkel wants Bush to agree to Kyoto-style caps, with extra urgency after U.N. climate reports this year have said world emissions will need to be cut to help avert more hunger, water shortages, heatwaves and rising seas. The White House said last week that preliminary data showed that U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, fell by 1.3 percent in 2006. "We are effectively confronting the important challenge of global climate change," Bush said. Raupach said, however, that a warm winter contributed to cut U.S. heating demand and a less than scorching 2005 summer had also curbed use of air conditioning.

ACLU sues Jeppesen over CIA flights The Denver Business Journal - 2:45 PM MDT Wednesday, May 30, 2007 American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday against Jeppesen DataPlan Inc. of San Jose, Calif., on behalf of alleged victims of U.S. government torture. Jeppesen DataPlan is part of aviation-data provider of Colorado. Based in Englewood, Jeppesen Sanderson is a subsidiary of aircraft manufacturer The ACLU alleges in its suit, filed in Northern California federal court, that Jeppesen knowingly provided flight services to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) , which enabled the secret transport of three terrorism suspects to overseas locations for interrogation and torture. The terrorism suspects are Binyam Mohamed of Ethiopia, Italian citizen Abou Elkassim Britel and Ahmed Agiza of Egypt. The suit contends Jeppesen -- through its international trip and flight-planning operation in San Jose -- "has been a main provider of flight and logistical support services for aircraft used by the CIA ...," according to an ACLU statement. Mike Pound, a Jeppesen Sanderson spokesman, was unavailable for comment this afternoon. But earlier today, Pound told CBS News that Jeppesen officials had no comment about the suit because they hadn't seen it yet. Pound did tell the television network that Jeppesen doesn't know the purpose of customers' flights. "We create flight plans, what the fuel requirements might be, where they might refuel, the airports they might use ... It's not our practice to ever inquire about the purpose of a trip," Pound told CBS. Anthony Romero, the ACLU's executive director, chastised American companies that allegedly profit from the U.S. government's so-called "extraordinary rendition" program, which allows the CIA to transport terrorism suspects outside this country. "Corporations that choose to participate in such activity can and should be held legally accountable," Romero said in a statement. Further allegations in the suit include: Mohamed was flown to Morocco in 2002 where he was interrogated and tortured for 18 months. He later was taken to Kabul, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he remains. Britel was flown from Pakistan to Morocco and tortured there. He's still in Morocco. Agiza was flown from Sweden to Egypt, where he was tortured and otherwise abused. He remains in Egypt. The ACLU filed suit under this country's Alien Tort Statue, which allows aliens to bring legal claims in the United States. Jeppesen Sanderson employs 3,000 people around the world -- 1,250 of them in Colorado. The company serves 85 percent of the world's airlines with navigational data, flight planning and operations solutions.

Lee said he wanted to visit the war-related shrine because his elder brother is memorialized there. The brother was killed in World War II while fighting for Japan. Taiwan at the time was a Japanese colony. "I don't know if I have time to pay a visit," Lee told Japanese reporters aboard the flight from Taipei to Tokyo. "But because my brother is enshrined there, I would be sorry if I cannot make it as a brother." Lee visited Japan in 2001 and 2004, but Wednesday's visit to Tokyo is his first to the capital in 22 years. "I was surprised to find that Tokyo Bay has become so clear," Lee said at the capital's Odaiba waterfront district. Lee, 84, said his visit to Japan was "not for political activities," which would antagonize Beijing. He has no plans to meet with politicians here during his stay through June 9.(IHT/Asahi: May 31,2007) 'Rightist' gets 8-year term for setting fire to Kato's home No redress for illegal actions during war Death sentence upheld for Aum Shinrikyo chemist Survey: 1,222 school pools have safety deficiencies Mother strangles daughter, fails in suicide attempt Anti-graft cop held in bid-rigging case Matsushita issues massive recall TOKYO: Lee Tenghui weighs Yasukuni visit ELECTRONICS: Victor president to step down in June Hungry For Words (e-Learning) Bilingual Vox Populi, Vox Dei Asahi Shimbun English-language Publication The Asahi Shimbun Asia Network Up-to-date columns and reports on pressing issues indispensable for mutual understanding in Asia.

The New York-based rights group said it would file a suit against Jeppesen Dataplan Inc. on Wednesday, charging that the company provided flight and logistical support to at least 15 aircraft on 70 so-called "rendition" flights. The suit, to be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, is being made on behalf of Binyam Mohamed, Abou Elkassim Britel and Ahmed Agiza, who the ACLU said were abducted by the CIA, detained and tortured. The complaint alleges Jeppesen organized flights over a four-year period to countries "it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted standards." "Extraordinary rendition should be condemned. It should not be seen as a source of corporate profit," Anthony Romero, ACLU executive director, told a news conference. A European Parliament-backed report found at least 1,245 CIA flights were made into or over Europe in the four years after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Washington acknowledges the secret transfer of suspects to third countries but denies torturing them or handing them over to countries that did. Jeppesen declined to comment on the ACLU suit, and would not say if the CIA was a customer. According to the ACLU, Jeppesen played a key role in what it called Washington's extraordinary rendition program, providing aircraft crew with itineraries, preparing flight plans, procuring landing permits from foreign governments and helping with customs clearance and ground transportation. &copy; Reuters 2007.

In the deadliest clash, Taliban ambushed a police convoy in Shahjoi district of southeastern Zabul province on Wednesday. The ensuing gunbattle left 16 police and 10 suspected insurgents dead and six police wounded, said Interior Ministry spokesman Zemeri Bashary. On Thursday, Afghan and NATO forces launched an operation in neighboring Helmand province&#039;s Sangin district, a Defense Ministry statement said. "Tens of enemies" were killed and wounded in clashes and airstrikes, it said. There was no immediate confirmation from NATO about the operation, nor was it possible to verify the casualty figures reported by the government from the remote battle site. After a winter lull in violence, both militant attacks and military operations have escalated this spring, with Helmand province bearing the worst of the violence as NATO and Afghan forces fight to root out militants from the country&#039;s opium heartland.

NATO wants to secure the area around the hydropower facility to allow a reliable electricity supply to support development that has been slow in coming to the region. In the west, insurgents launched an attack in Farah province&#039;s Pusht Rod district late Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said.

Sutiyoso, a retired general, said he received an apology from Bill Farmer, the Australian ambassador, during a meeting in Jakarta on Thursday. "The Australian side has apologised and we will get an official apology letter," Sutiyoso told reporters after the meeting. An Australian embassy spokesman declined to comment. "We are a nation with a big heart," said Sutiyoso. "We have to forgive, even more so because the problem was only a technical problem." Indonesia demanded an explanation from Australia after Sydney police tried to deliver a summons to Sutiyoso in his hotel room requesting that he give evidence at an inquest into the death of an Australia-based journalist in East Timor in 1975. The governor of Indonesia's capital city said on Wednesday that police used a master key to enter his hotel room. The row prompted a demonstration outside the Australian embassy in Jarkata, with Indonesian protesters demanding an apology. Sutiyoso, who was scheduled to visit Canberra after Sydney, cut short his visit and flew back to Jakarta early on Wednesday, saying he felt "slighted by such treatment". A spokesman for Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the Indonesian president, said the president was "surprised" at the incident and expected that Australia would clarify the matter. John Howard, Australia's prime minister, also sought to calm the row saying that, while coroners conducting inquests acted independently of the government, "proper courtesy should be extended" when they carried out their work. Sutiyoso served in the Indonesian military for three decades and was part of 's occupation of the half-island nation. The inquest in Sydney is probing the death of a cameraman who was among five British, Australian and New Zealand newsmen killed in the border town of Balibo, in East Timor, ahead of the Indonesian military's invasion in 1975.

Former president Lee Teng-hui ( ) yesterday said he would like to visit the Yasukuni shrine, a controversial memorial to war dead where his elder brother is enshrined. Lee's elder brother served in the Japanese navy and died while on duty in February 1945 in the Philippines. "I have not yet decided on the timing, but since I am here, I think that I should go see my brother," Lee told reporters on his arrival at Narita airport near Tokyo. "I will meet my brother for the first time in 60 years," Lee said. Lee, accompanied by his wife Tseng Wen-hui ( ), left for Japan yesterday for a 10-day visit. Speaking to Japanese reporters on the flight from Taipei, the 84-year-old former leader said he wanted to pray at the Yasukuni shrine because he did not know how much longer he would live. The Yasukuni shrine honors 2.5 million war dead, including colonial subjects who fought for Japan. Visits to the shrine by Japanese leaders have long been a subject of dispute with China and South Korea which view the shrine as a symbol of Japan's militarist past. Most controversially, the Shinto shrine lists the names of 14 top war criminals from World War II. "I will meet my brother for the first time in 60 years." Lee Teng-hui, former president Based on the itinerary released by Lee's office, the former president will spend the first three days visiting Tokyo, culminating in a ceremony wherein he will be presented with the first Shinpei Goto Prize by Tokyo's Shinpei Goto Society tomorrow. The prize was established to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of the late Japanese colonial administrator Shinpei Goto and is awarded to people who have contributed to national or regional development. From Saturday to Tuesday, Lee will make an "oku no hosomichi" tour covering the prefectures of Miyagi, Yamagata, Iwate, Akita and Gunma, retracing a journey made by the Japanese poet Basho in 1689 on which his famous work The Narrow Road to Oku Lee is scheduled to visit Akita International University next Wednesday, where he will give a speech on Japanese education and hold a seminar with Taiwanese students. He will also visit Takushoku University in Tokyo to discuss the global outlook this year. He will wrap up his visit next Saturday. This story has been viewed 606 times.

Bush: A major Presidential decision was greeted with bipartisan praise and international congratulations. By picking former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick on May 30 to replace Paul Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank, Bush made a symbolic and substantive statement that he hoped to unify the controversy-wracked institution and put Wolfowitz's divisive, two-year tenure quickly behind him. Wolfowitz resigned his position, effective June 30, amid ethics questions raised by his role in securing a generous compensation package for his girlfriend (see BusinessWeek.com, 5/17/07, "More Problems After Wolfowitz" An Expert in Diplomacy Zoellick, like Wolfowitz, is known as an accomplished academic and a demanding boss. But unlike the combative Wolfowitz, the prospective bank president has a reputation as an expert in diplomacy and international banking. Zoellick, 53, served as a top State Dept. official under President Bush, and the top Treasury Department official on international economic matters. He was also President George H.W. Bush's top adviser for two Group of Seven international economic summits, as well as a managing director at Goldman Sachs ( ) and chairman of the company's international advisers department. His global economic expertise includes work on issues from Latin American debt relief and German reunification to Chinese entry into the World Trade Organization and restructuring U.S. aid programs for Africa. Democratic Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, lauded Zoellick as "the right person for this job." Said Baucus: "It's hard to imagine a more intelligent, hard-working, and capable person to assume the bank's leadership at this difficult point in its history. Bob has the skills and the integrity to put the bank back on the right path." Not Much of a Honeymoon House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) praised Zoellick's efforts to bring peace to war-torn Darfur, calling him a sensitive and caring person. Even Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.), Bush's vanquished 2004 Presidential rival, says Zoellick "brings a diverse range of skills and international experience to the position" and hopes he "can regain the confidence of employees and donor nations that was lost under the previous leader." Kind words aside, Zoellick can't expect much of a honeymoon in his new job as the bank's 11th president in its 60-year history. Bank-watchers say he has a lot of work to do to soothe the hard feelings generated by Wolfowitz, whose role as an architect of the Bush Administration's Iraq policy rankled European allies and bank staffers. "His major initial challenge is to rebuild the morale of the organization and to bring someone with a strong management background in to put things back together again in a better way than before," says Edwin "Ted" Truman, senior fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Center for International Economics. During the White House announcement ceremony, Bush and Zoellick both alluded to the recent divisions and the challenges ahead. Zoellick, said Bush, "has earned the trust and support of leaders from every region of the world." Zoellick declared that "we need to approach this task with humility and creative minds." He praised the World Bank staff that warred with Wolfowitz as "many fine professionals from all over the world." "The World Bank has passed through a difficult time for all involved," Zoellick said during the nine-minute event in the Roosevelt Room. "There are frustrations, anxieties, and tensions about the past that could inhibit the future. This is understandable, but not without remedy. We need to put yesterday's discord behind us and to focus on the future together."

Thursday May 31st 2007 Skip to search tools Skip to online features Skip to print edition Skip to main navigation Skip to main content Skip to bottom links Letters to the editor Middle East & Africa Economist Diaries and Business Gifts Skip to search tools Skip to online features Skip to print edition Skip to main navigation Skip to main content Skip to bottom links The party is over May 31st 2007 | BANGKOK Thailand takes a step away from democracy and freedom THE nine judges of Thailand's Constitutional Tribunal took ten hours to outline in a marathon session, televised live on May 30th, the electoral-fraud cases against the country's two main political parties (and several small ones). They explained in elaborate detail why Thai Rak Thai (TRT), the largest, was being disbanded, whereas its main opponent, the Democrat party, was cleared of all charges. However, the elegance of their legal arguments may be lost on millions of Thais. They gave TRT sweeping election victories in 2001 and 2005 and probably still support the party and its leader, Thaksin Shinawatra. As voters may see it, the country's most popular party has been destroyed by a court set up by the military junta that seized power last year, claiming to be rescuing democracy. A week before the tribunal's rulings, Thailand's revered King Bhumibol intervened, giving warning that his realm was &#8220;close to sinking&#8221; and noting that &#8220;political parties must exist&#8221;. This raised hopes that the tribunal would stop short of dissolving either main party, and punish only individual politicians. Those hopes have been dashed. In four months of hearings, the tribunal examined allegations of misbehaviour by the accused parties during a snap election Mr Thaksin had called in April last year. The Democrats and other parties boycotted the election, claiming it would be unfair. The courts later found grounds to annul the results, after the king urged them to sort out the &#8220;mess&#8221;. TRT was accused among other things of bribing small parties to take part in the election, while the Democrats were accused of inducing leaders of smaller parties to make false accusations against TRT. After the coup, the junta, led by the army chief, General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, replaced the Constitutional Court with a new tribunal, whose judges it selected, and told it to pursue the electoral-fraud cases. The junta also appointed an interim government of old soldiers and bureaucrats; and created a temporary parliament and another unelected body to write a new constitution. The generals also set up investigations into the allegations of corruption and abuse of power by the Thaksin administration, while their interim government sought to borrow some of its policies, such as cheap health care and development funds for rural villages, which had made &#8220;Thaksinomics&#8221; so popular. However, although the corruption investigations have unearthed enough evidence to press charges, they failed to find enough of a &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; to wreck Mr Thaksin's reputation irreparably. Meanwhile, the interim government has dithered and bungled, dragging down the economy and making Thaksinomics, for all its other flaws, look good. And Mr Thaksin, through a series of stunts such as bidding for Britain's Manchester City football club, has ensured he is not forgotten. This week's judgment would appear to eliminate TRT and prevent any comeback by Mr Thaksin and his henchmen. But the generals are far from being in the clear. Lesser figures in TRT may regroup and find ways to recapture the party's millions of votes, in the elections the junta promises to hold by the year's end. That is if things get that far. The junta's constitution-writing body has already backtracked on several undemocratic clauses it tried to slip into the new charter, such as permitting an unelected prime minister and allowing for a &#8220;crisis council&#8221;, including military chiefs, to step in and solve political conflicts. But other unpopular provisions&#8212;such as having the Senate appointed by judges and bureaucrats rather than elected&#8212;remain in the draft. So voters, angry at the destruction of the party many support, may reject the proposed charter in the referendum the junta is promising to hold. The mobilisation of police and soldiers ordered by the jumpy generals to head off protests, and their censorship of pro-Thaksin websites and radio stations, may not be enough to prevent rising popular unrest against the regime, despite Mr Thaksin's call on his supporters to accept the verdict. Local newspapers had quoted one of the nine judges as saying they would &#8220;apply the spirit&#8221; of the coup-makers in making their rulings. This, plus the severity of the punishment meted out to Mr Thaksin and his party, and the absolution of the Democrats, will only raise suspicions that the destruction of TRT was a pre-determined outcome.

Zoellick, left, yesterday to lead the World Bank. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. is at right. A scandal forced out the departing bank president, Paul D. Wolfowitz. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 31, 2007 WASHINGTON, May 30 &#151; The stands ready to inherit may be battered, fractious and rudderless. But he said Wednesday that he saw himself not simply as a healer but as a leader ready to establish a new agenda to help the world&#8217;s poor. &#8220;On the one hand, one has to calm the waters,&#8221; Mr. Zoellick told reporters in the afternoon. &#8220;But one also has to start to navigate the course of the future.&#8221; At another point he said, &#8220;People in the bank recognize that it&#8217;s going to have to go through some mission adjustment.&#8221; But he declined to specify details. People close to Mr. Zoellick say that based on his record in past economic and diplomatic jobs, he is likely to bring a demanding approach that could disturb the status quo. At his session with journalists, Mr. Zoellick signaled that he would retain and build on the anticorruption policies of the departing president, , who resigned nearly two weeks ago after a furor over charges of favoritism. Mr. Zoellick&#8217;s nomination was formally announced Wednesday at the White House, where President Bush praised him for having &#8220;earned the trust and support of leaders from every region of the world.&#8221; Mr. Bush also praised Mr. Wolfowitz for making the bank &#8220;a more effective partner for development.&#8221; The bank&#8217;s 24-member board has welcomed Mr. Zoellick&#8217;s nomination but said it would accept other nominations until June 15. But bank officials dismissed the statement as a formality and predicted that the board would move smoothly toward making Mr. Zoellick president, despite reservations by some about the United States&#8217; continuing to exercise its 60-year-old prerogative of filling the job. European officials said they would not disturb the arrangement of having the American president picking the head of the bank, in part to leave intact the tradition of having Europeans pick the head of the Mr. Zoellick has been told by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and others that the bank must do more to provide concrete measures of the effects of its $23 billion in lending to poor countries, in part to assure Congress about how the money is being spent. In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Zoellick also suggested that the international community must rethink having the bank provide loans to countries like China that have access to global capital markets and possess huge foreign exchange reserves. The bank, he said, could move more into providing technical assistance to these countries. &#8220;It would have been easy to get a figurehead,&#8221; an administration official involved in the selection process said of Mr. Zoellick. &#8220;Bob&#8217;s first posture at the bank will be to listen and to travel. But he definitely brings some ideas on development. He has thought about it a lot.&#8221; Others who know Mr. Zoellick say that despite having a reputation for being a brusque and demanding executive, he is also good at setting long-term objectives and building consensus. &#8220;The World Bank, like other international organizations, needs substantial reform,&#8221; said former Secretary of State James A. Baker III , who helped bring Mr. Zoellick into government in the 1980s. &#8220;I think Bob will be a very good agent of change. It&#8217;s a huge, humongous bureaucracy. But he&#8217;s a very resourceful person.&#8221; Colleagues noted that Mr. Zoellick brought &#8220;tough love&#8221; to some of his previous jobs, most notably as United States trade representative during Mr. Bush&#8217;s first term. As trade envoy, Mr. Zoellick worked with Europeans in 2001, shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to make the next round of global trade talks focus on helping poor countries by letting them export more farm products and industrial goods to rich countries. But he also demanded that poor countries that gained from being able to export more also commit themselves to economic reforms. &#8220;He believes in rewarding opportunity, encouraging small business and frankly reducing the power of entrenched oligarchies that thrive on closed markets and corrupt environments,&#8221; said Christopher A. Padilla, Mr. Zoellick&#8217;s chief of staff at the trade office and when he was deputy secretary of state. &#8220;That agenda was a very important component of what we were trying to achieve,&#8221; said Mr. Padilla, now an assistant secretary of commerce for export administration. &#8220;I&#8217;m confident he will bring the same agenda to the World Bank.&#8221; There are some at the World Bank, many bank officials say, who may resist a bias toward encouraging free-market economies, especially at a time when faith in that philosophy has faded in Latin America and elsewhere. But bank officials said they would welcome a new president with knowledge in this area. &#8220;A lot of people used to think that if the Democrats win the White House in 2008, we might get a new president who won&#8217;t be pursing free markets and corruption,&#8221; said one bank official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. &#8220;But most people at the bank also realize that reform is necessary.&#8221; The official added: &#8220;Sure, Zoellick is coming with an agenda. People at the bank will be focusing on whether he is going to be fixated on trade. But he&#8217;s a basic policy wonk. He&#8217;s actually a lot closer in personality to the typical bank staffer than Wolfowitz was.&#8221; More Articles in Washington &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Military officials at U.S. Southern Command did not release details about the death or identify the detainee, who was among about 80 Saudi Arabians in custody.

Three detainees committed suicide in their cells simultaneously on June 10, 2006, using clothes and sheets to fashion makeshift nooses. officials called the incident an act of "asymmetric warfare" and a way to garner negative publicity for the detention facility on the U.S. base. Those detainees, according to the military, allegedly conspired with others to carry out a suicide pact and passed notes among themselves about how to do it. The three suicides in June were the first detainee deaths reported at Guantanamo since it opened in January 2002. As of last year, there had been more than 40 suicide attempts by about 25 detainees, including some who had tried to overdose on hoarded drugs and one who repeatedly tried to die by hanging and slashing himself. Such cases are illustrative of the negative image that Guantanamo has internationally; even Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has expressed a desire to close the facility because of the taint it carries. Attorneys for detainees have talked emotionally about the desperation their clients feel and have railed against what they consider worsening conditions at the facility's newest camp, which is modeled after U.S. prisons. There are about 380 detainees at Guantanamo, fewer than half of the 775 detainees who have been there since it was opened to house those captured in the war in and in the larger Bush administration effort against terrorism. Three detainees have been charged with crimes under the Military Commissions Act of 2006. and at Guantanamo referred all inquiries to Southcom. A Southcom spokesman said last night that he could not elaborate on details of yesterday's death. Wells Dixon, an attorney at CCR, said last night that he has asked the for information about the detainee, and that his organization is already calling for an independent investigation into his death. Dixon, who visited Saudi detainees at Guantanamo earlier this month, said they "were suffering terribly." "The fact that four detainees have now died while in military custody should not surprise anyone," Dixon said. "These results are predictable, given the fact that these men have been confined for so long without charge or trial under such difficult circumstances."

Turkey beefs up military presence on Iraqi border Turkey continued to reinforce its military presence along its border with Iraq on Wednesday, fuelling concerns of an impending incursion into the neighbouring country's Kurdish north. (AP - 31/05/07; Reuters, AP, BBC, VOA, NTV MSNBC, Stratfor, Turkish Press - 30/05/07; AP - 29/05/07) PKK training camps in northern Iraq would be the target of any cross-border military action by Turkey. [Getty Images] Turkey sent more tanks and troops to its border with Iraq on Wednesday (May 30th), fuelling speculation about an imminent military offensive against Kurdish rebels based in the neighbouring country's north. According to Reuters, a group of 20 tanks loaded on trucks left the army barracks in Mardin near Syria and headed east towards the border. Large contingents of soldiers, tanks, guns and armoured personnel carriers are said to be already deployed in the region. Wednesday's move came a day after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged the United States and Iraq to destroy PKK rebel bases in northern Iraq, refusing to rule out possible unilateral action by his country. "We expect the United States and Iraq to destroy, scatter bases of terrorists there," the Turkish leader said in remarks on private NTV television late Tuesday. "Our expectations have been relayed to the opposite side. We have to achieve results. It would not be right to spell out a deadline." The PKK has been fighting for self-rule in Turkey's Kurdish-dominated southeast since 1984, leading a campaign of bombings, kidnappings and armed attacks that have left more than 30,000 people dead. The group is outlawed in Turkey, and is listed as a terrorist organisation by both the EU and the United States. Ankara authorities believe up to 2,300 PKK militants operate inside Turkey, while about 3,800 have found shelter in northern Iraq. Public pressure has been increasing on the government since a suicide bombing on May 22nd that killed six people and injured more than 120. Six Turkish soldiers died the following day when their vehicle hit a landmine in a southeastern area where PKK guerrillas are active. Another soldier was killed by a landmine Wednesday in the province of Hakkari, near the Iraqi border. A total of 13 Kurdish rebels have been killed in clashes with the Turkish forces since Monday. "The PKK must be eliminated as a problem between Iraq and Turkey," the Turkish special envoy to Iraq, Oguz Celikkol, was quoted as saying on CNN-Turk television on Wednesday. After a visit to Iraq this week, he voiced hope that the Kurdish issue will be resolved before Turkey decides to take unilateral action. The Turkish Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, called on Iraq to move against the PKK rebels on its territory. "What we want from the Iraqi government is to take the necessary steps to stop the terrorists' activities by any means," Foreign Ministry spokesman Levent Bilman told reporters. Asked whether Ankara had notified Baghdad about a possible Turkish cross-border attack, he said "We do not have to inform anybody about the possibility of such an intervention." Concerned about the impact on regional stability, the United States has urged Ankara against taking unilateral military action. The best way for dealing with the problem without jeopardising peace in the border region is through US, Turkish and Iraqi co-operation, officials in Washington have said.

Two soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb during a foot patrol yesterday, the military said without specifying the exact location. Another soldier died from a 'non-battle related cause' in Baghdad on Tuesday, bringing the total for May to 116, the highest since 137 troops died in the November 2004 full scale invasion of Fallujah. 'First and foremost, it's been a tough month,' Brigadier General Perry Wiggins, deputy director of regional operations with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at a Defense Department briefing yesterday. Wiggins attributed the rise in casualties to renewed efforts to restore stability to the war-torn country, explaining that four years into the occupation, 'we're moving into places where we haven't been, not necessarily before.' The latest fatalities bring the number of US soldiers killed in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion to 3,468, according to an Agence France-Presse count based on Pentagon figures.

Iranian play overwhelms Serbs Castro says Bush wants him killed Tue, 29 May 2007 12:26:36 Cuban President Fidel Castro Cuban leader Fidel Castro has accused US president George W. Bush of wanting to have him killed in his most recent article. "I am not the first and will not be the last that Bush ordered deprived of life, or of those that he proposed to be killed as an individual or in a large group," AFP quoted Castro as saying in his article published Monday. In the article entitled 'Ideas can't be killed', Castro said Bush was recently queried "by an important person" over his Cuba policy and replied, according to the Cuban leader, "I am a hard-line president and I only await Castro's death." Over the past two months, 80 articles have been published attributed to Castro. In another article he wrote last week, Castro said that the first surgeries had not been successful which had prolonged the recovery period. Many of his articles have attacked Bush's promotion throughout the region of using food crops to produce ethanol to fuel vehicles.

On Wednesday the Constitutional Court imposed a similar ban on 110 other members of his Thai Rak Thai party, and ordered the party itself to be dissolved. The verdicts come after the court found Thaksin's party guilty of electoral fraud. Supporters of the ousted former leader, including some of the banned party executives, planned a protest on Thursday over the court decision which stunned the country. Thai Rak Thai's rivals, the Democrat Party, were cleared of similar charges and escaped a threatened dissolution. Speaking after the verdict Thaksin, who now resides in London, asked his supporters to remain calm and respect the court's ruling. "We have to respect the rules of the game. That is, the rule of the law" Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted Thai prime minister He urged them to accept the disbanding of his party and the five-year political ban on its top leadership. "As party leader, I humbly accept the ruling and I want to urge the [Council for National Security] and government to hold general elections as soon as possible," Thaksin said in a statement read out by his lawyer in Before the ruling Thaksin told supporters to "respect the rules of the game" and "the rule of the law". The government meanwhile has announced a nationwide security clampdown for an indefinite period, placing thousands of soldiers on alert and beefing up deployments at police checkpoints. Sonthi Boonyaratglin, the general who led last September's coup, said the situation was "totally under control" and authorities were monitoring Thaksin associates and "hardcore" loyalists for possible trouble. "Security measures have been stepped up since last night and will gradually be increased," Sonthi told AFP. "The measures will be in place for a long time." The military-backed government has promised to hold elections at the end of the year after a new constitution is promulgated. Surayad Chulanont, the military-installed prime minister, has reiterated an earlier warning that he would impose a state of emergency to quell any unrest. The ruling, which cannot be appealed, held Thai Rak Thai had used "parliamentary elections only as a means to achieve totalitarian power" and disregarded the rule of law. The court's decision drew a mixed reaction, with some analysts saying it was likely to "deepen confrontation" between the military-led government and the masses. "Thai Rak Thai commanded a large rural electorate and if they don't win them over and fill that political vacuum, there will be trouble," said Thitinan Pongsidhirak, a political scientist at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. "The resistance might be quiet but it will also be deep-seated and strong," he added. But other analysts said Thai politics was entering uncharted waters, and the ensuing uncertainty could be used by any party to gain power. "A lot could happen at this point... the process of bargaining may change and things may be quite different from what people expect," said Chris Baker, a veteran analyst and author on the country's politics. He said it was difficult to predict too far into the future of Thai politics. "There is not a lot for any party to gain from violence at this point," he added. "If anything, it will strengthen the grip of the military."

Meanwhile, the hunt was continuing for five Britons who were snatched at gunpoint from a finance ministry building in the capital earlier this week, in an abduction that has been blamed on Baghdad's Shiite militias. US forces detained two suspects in a raid on Sadr City, the eastern Baghdad bastion of Shiite cleric Moqtada Al Sadr's Mehdi Army, but it was not clear whether this operation was linked to the missing Britons. The US soldiers were killed Wednesday when a roadside bomb hit their foot patrol and brought US casualties for the month to 116, the most since November 2004 when marines fought a fierce battle to retake the city of Fallujah. Unlike in Fallujah, US forces have fought no major set-piece encounters in May, but instead have been fanning out through Baghdad and a belt of flashpoint towns around the capital in a bid to quell sectarian violence. "First and foremost, it's been a tough month," Brigadier General Perry Wiggins, deputy director of regional operations with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at a Defense Department briefing Wednesday. "We're moving into places where we haven't been, not necessarily before." April was also bloody for the US-led coalition, with 104 deaths. Taken together, the two past months have been the deadliest since invasion of March 2003. The news will increase pressure on US President George W. Bush, who has already seen domestic support for his war strategy fall to an all-time low and is facing calls to set a timetable for troops withdrawals. May's casualties coincide with a "surge" in US reinforcements, which is due to peak next month. Under this plan, US and Iraqi troops are basing themselves in exposed patrol bases in order to control Baghdad street by street. The result has seen a drop off in attacks by sectarian death squads, with every day bringing more arrests of kidnappers and weapons smugglers, but bomb attacks have continued and US troops now face an insurgent backlash. US commander General David Petraeus hopes that the surge will provide breathing space for Prime Minister Nuri Al Maliki's government, allowing him to push through laws to underpin a program of national reconciliation. But the capital's centers of power are still far from safe. Almost daily, rockets and mortar shells hit the Green Zone - the fortified district protecting the US embassy and Maliki's administration. And Tuesday, a squad of gunmen in police uniforms stormed a finance ministry building outside the zone in downtown Baghdad and dragged off five British visitors: a management consultant and his four bodyguards. The Britons are still missing amid fears that they have fallen into the hands of one of the Shiite militia groups that have infiltrated Iraq's police. Insurgents also struck an important propaganda victory May 12, when an Al Qaeda gang destroyed a small US patrol manning a temporary observation post near Mahmudiyah south of Baghdad, killing four soldiers and capturing three. The corpse of one was later found floating in the Euphrates River, with gunshot wounds to the head and torso. Almost three weeks after the attack his two comrades are still missing, despite a massive US manhunt. The missing men's commander, Colonel Michael Kershaw of the 10th Mountain Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, said that interrogations of suspects had thrown up a number of leads and that the search would continue. "Obviously we have a number of different trails we are following. They all lead to different groups. We know we have some of the people that participated," he said at a base outside Baghdad Wednesday. "We know that local insurgent groups participated. We also believe there was a level of involvement from outside the local area," he said. Kershaw's search area is a 854-square-kilometer (330-square-mile) sector in an insurgent hotbed of palm groves, farming communities, and irrigation canals dubbed "The Triangle of Death." "All units in Iraq are on the lookout for these missing soldiers and they act on intelligence as well. So really it's a nationwide search. Units act on intelligence in their areas as it comes up," the commander added. Kershaw's troops have questioned 1,100 people and detained 104 of them. "We have scooped up a few people who have either confessed to it or during questioning shown that they know too much about it not to have been there," said unit spokesman Major Web Wright. A suicide bomber in an explosives belt killed one Iraqi policeman in an attack on his patrol and wounded at least seven more people in Fallujah, authorities said.

Indonesia had lodged a formal diplomatic protest after the governor, ex-general Sutiyoso, was served with a New South Wales state police summons to attend a coroner's inquest into the 1975 deaths of five journalists in East Timor. Sutiyoso was quoted as saying Australia's ambassador to Indonesia, Bill Farmer, had expressed regret and promised to get a letter of apology from the NSW leader. "We are a big-hearted nation. We have to forgive," Sutiyoso was quoted as saying by online news service Detik.com. "Let's not make illogical demands. What's more, the Australian side has apologised and will work on an official apology," he added. Officials at his office could not immediately be reached to confirm the comments. Later on Thursday, Australian Associated Press reported NSW Premier Morris Iemma had written to Sutiyoso to apologise for any distress and inconvenience caused during his stay in Sydney. Iemma said the police action had not been sanctioned by the government and he was disappointed the governor's visit had been cut short. "The circumstances which led to the entry to your room will be thoroughly investigated," he wrote. Sutiyoso, who was in Sydney at the invitation of the state government, said two officers had barged into his hotel room on Tuesday while he was sleeping and had asked him to sign an invitation to testify in the inquest. Australian Prime Minister John Howard downplayed the row. "The relationship with Indonesia is very strong, it's very robust and it's very close. That does not alter the fact that this matter does need to be explained," he told reporters. About 50 demonstrators protested outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta on Thursday over the perceived snub, fewer than the several hundred a day earlier. Sutiyoso, who served as a captain in East Timor at the start of Indonesian occupation of the territory, said he was angry at his treatment and denied he had anything to do with the deaths of the journalists. The Sydney inquest into the death of the five Australia-based journalists heard they were deliberately gunned down by Indonesian soldiers. In final submissions to the inquest, Mark Tedeschi, the counsel assisting the coroner, said the journalists were killed in Balibo in East Timor to stop them reporting news of Indonesian military actions. Official Indonesian reports have blamed the deaths on Oct. 16, 1975 on crossfire, as Indonesian forces entered East Timor in an incursion ahead of a full-scale invasion of the territory in December of the same year. Indonesia's Foreign Ministry has warned any adverse findings from the inquiry will be ignored and will only serve to damage the fragile bilateral relationship. news is provided by Zoom to full size map Scientists warn on biofuels as palm oil price jumps Australian PM receives carbon-trade report Australia warns of violence before PNG election Australia and Philippines sign defence pact PRESS DIGEST-Indonesian General News - May 31 One year on from Jogyakarta quake, communities take charge Source: WV - International ACT Alert: Indonesia tidal waves displace thousands Source: ACT - Switzerland CWS situation report: Southeast/Southern Asia coastal flooding One year after the earthquake on Java/Malteser International: Help for more than 30,000 victims Source: Malteser International - Germany Plan launched a worldwide camapign calling for action on girls' rights abuses ATTENTION EDITORS - USE OF OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE Supporters of Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso rally outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta May 31, 2007.

Lee is on an 11-day visit to Japan. (AP Photo/Itsuo Inouye) TOKYO - Former Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui arrived in Japan on Wednesday as China expressed concerns that his trip may be politically motivated. Lee has been a strong critic of Beijing, which still claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan more than five decades after the two sides split during a civil war. Lee's office has said the 11-day trip will focus on visits to Japanese cultural sites. His itinerary, however, also includes speeches and a news conference. Earlier this week, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi expressed concerns about the trip to his Japanese counterpart, Taro Aso, during a meeting in Germany. Yang said the trip has "political implications" and may prevent progress in China-Japan relations, according to Keiji Kamei, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official. Aso said that Tokyo's understanding is that Lee will not engage in any political activities while in Japan, the official said. On Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu urged Japan to "not give any political platform for the Taiwan separatist movement." Japan has official diplomatic relations with Beijing, but not with Taiwan. China regularly opposes visits by Taiwanese officials to countries with which it has diplomatic ties. The 84-year-old former leader is to give a speech Friday at the Shimpei Goto award ceremony, named after a former administrator of Taiwan. Japan ruled Taiwan as a colony between 1895 and 1945. He is to give another speech on the global situation after 2007 at a university in Tokyo next Thursday and hold a news conference next Saturday. Lee told reporters that he also wants to visit a Tokyo war shrine where his older brother is among the enshrined. The Yasukuni Shrine deifies Japan's 2.5 million war dead and tens of thousands of Koreans and Taiwanese who were drafted into Japan's military. The shrine is vilified by critics at home and abroad as symbolizing the country's militaristic past. Class-A war criminals executed for their role in World War II are enshrined at Yasukuni.

She also must continue with counseling and treatment and attend a victim-impact panel regarding the effects of drunken driving. Banaszewski was fined $2,155. Police stopped her Ford Ecoline van at 7:25 p.m. Feb. 12 near Gamon Road and Longfellow Drive after a motorist alerted them to a possible intoxicated driver. Her blood-alcohol level is unknown because she declined to submit to a Breathalyzer test. Prosecutor Michael O'Donnell said she failed a field-sobriety assessment and admitted drinking a half bottle of vodka earlier that evening. In exchange for the plea, prosecutors agreed to drop child endangerment allegations. Banaszewski, a mother of five, had three of the children in her van that night. After the arrest, she voluntarily checked herself into a two-month in-patient treatment program followed by another week in a hospital. She also is attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. "We're very satisfied with the outcome of this case," defense attorney Donald Ramsell said. "I believe we were able to show the prosecution she's a very fine mother and is addressing whatever concerns were needed." DuPage Associate Judge Daniel Guerin presided over the plea deal. He granted Banaszewski a judicial driving permit Wednesday allowing her to drive only to counseling and treatment sessions. The judge, though, ordered her to abstain from alcohol, and prohibited her from driving with her children until she regains full driving privileges in late September. Banaszewski had an otherwise spotless criminal and driving history. She declined to comment Wednesday while leaving court.

White House Unveils New Climate Strategy By John D.

But the initiative -- to be outlined in a speech this morning -- is likely to run into criticism among some environmentalists, who worry that Mr. Bush's separate dialogue among the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitters will tend to undermine broader United Nations negotiations that are just getting under ...

Live coverage of reaction to the report Commissioner Sidney Linden released his four-volume report this morning at the Forest Memorial Community Centre, not far from the Ipperwash Provincial Park. Justice Linden concludes that while it was OPP officer Ken Deane who ultimately killed Mr. George during a confrontation between police and native protestors, the officer "should not have been in a position to shoot Mr. George in the first place." Email to a friend "The federal government, the provincial government and the OPP must all assume some responsibility for decisions or failures that increased the risk of violence and made a tragic confrontation more likely," Justice Linden states in his report. Justice Linden cites numerous failures in police strategy and intelligence as contributing factors in the death of Mr. George, including the failure to use aboriginal mediators to communicate with individuals occupying the park. The commissioner also criticizes a decision to send in police tactical teams at night to confront protestors based on faulty intelligence information. "The OPP Incident Commander should have realized that sending a large number of officers in darkness, with helmets, shields and guns to confront the First Nation occupiers could have easily erupted and resulted in a confrontation," the report states. Justice Linden rebuffs allegations that Ontario politicians, including Premier Mike Harris, attempted to interfere in OPP operations. "The provincial government had the authority to establish policing policy, but not direct police operations. The Premier and his government did not cross this line," the report states. However, Justice Linden does accuse Mr. Harris of making racist remarks, which "did not contribute to resolving Ipperwash peacefully." In particular, Justice Linden concludes Mr. Harris said "I want the f-king Indians out of the park," during a meeting with senior officials despite the former premier's testimony that he never uttered those words. "These comments and the speed at which the premier wished to end the occupation created an atmosphere that unduly narrowed the scope of the government's response to the occupation," Justice Linden said this morning. The report states Mr. Harris "could have urged patience, rather than speed" and criticizes the provincial government for not appointing a mediator at the outset of the conflict in September 1995. The federal government is also partly to blame for allowing "the land issue" surrounding the Ipperwash site to "fester for decades." In his report, Justice Linden concludes "the most urgent priority is for the federal government to return" the land to local native bands "immediately." The OPP sergeant who killed George was convicted in 1997 of criminal negligence causing death and sentenced to perform two years of community service. He was killed in a car crash in 2006.

Everyone on board the transport chopper was killed: the five-member US Army crew and their two military passengers, a Briton and a Canadian. NATO says troops who headed to the crash site immediately after the helicopter went down were ambushed by enemy fighters. The unit then called in an air strike to "eliminate the enemy threat." The Chinook went down in southern Afghanistan's Helmand province, which has seen heavy fighting in recent weeks. A Taliban claim of responsibility hasn't been confirmed, but a spokesman called The Associated Press to report the downing hours before NATO reported the information.

Thursday, May 31, 2007 Another Iraq War to help the Turkish Islamists? Dr. Muhammad Shamsaddin Megalommatis As the tension rises in the borders between Turkey and Iraq, Turkey continues a military build up, and the pathetic Turkish premier refuses refused to rule out action, we have to view the events in the light of the recent internal strife that brought in Turkey the secularist majority and establishment to a frontal opposition with the villainous plans of the Erdogan – Gul clique. The US needs Turkey more than Turkey needs the US We have to add to the overall picture the recent developments between Turkey and the US, namely the US incursion into Turkish aerospace. As a matter of fact, the US administration has fallen victims of the most disastrous advisers whose ability to cause unprecedented damage to the US must be internationally recognized. If America had in Europe a friend, an important country able to engage in a war without being defeated within 48 hours, that country was neither pacifist and quasi-neutralized Germany, nor pompous (and hollow) France, nor unwarlike Italy; it was pugnacious Turkey. Leaving aside the European weaklings, still today at a moment of an undeniable Russian comeback, the US – all accounts made as regards 3 dozens of European states – can count only on Turkey, Poland, and (taken as an island) the UK. This is definitely not much. At a moment of Russian threats emanate every moment in terms of energy blackmail, Middle Eastern confrontation involvement, support of Iran’s exploration of its nuclear potentialities, and opposition to the US-led War against the Islamic Terror, only a paranoid would think that America has the slightest chance to protect its own interests from the African Atlas to India, let alone prevail in the area, without an all-committed alliance with Turkey. The US needs Turkey so badly that the White House inhabitant and his power sharing Congress and Senate opponents should compete for Turkey’s favours, and incite Ankara to return in force from Somalia to Caucasus and from Algeria to Iraq. Yet, demented Pelosi supports unnecessary pro-Armenian resolutions (that concern the past, not the present), and support is offered to the one Turk who has chances – if ruling Turkey – to cause colossal damage to the US indispensable ally, Islamic terrorist premier Erdogan. Even worse, the only warrantors of Turkey’s superior military power are viewed rather inimically, although they are politically and ideologically close the US ruling class, and in addition are supported by an undeniably overwhelming majority of Turks (oscillating around 70 to 75%). The US indirect support to Erdogan is undeniable; suffice it to read the New York Times, and you get the feeling that capital of America is Mecca, and that Pelosi’s and Bush’s common enemy is the Secularist Rainbow of Turkish political parties (Nationalist, Conservative and Social-Democrat), which are expected to total 70 to 75% in the forthcoming July elections. The massive manifestations of overwhelming popular rejection of Erdogan’s Islamist agenda did not get adequate coverage in the US and the EU mass media, and when they did, the reader would be maneuvered to be negatively predisposed. Explosive situation between Turkey and the US in Iraq However, last week two US F-16 fighter jets based in Iraq made an incursion into Turkish airspace; anti-Erdogan and pro-secular Turkish media interpreted the event as an attempt to intimidate Ankara into refraining from any action inside Iraq. The US said the violation of the airspace was "unintended" and was under investigation. Then, the Turkish premier warned Washington there should be no repeat. The event took place on a harassed background of Kurdish terrorist guerilla that has long been highly and severely denounced by various populations that inhabit along with Turks the SE provinces of Turkey. Turkey made public the proofs of the PKK group’s involvement in the recent suicide bombing in Ankara and in a landmine attack on troops. The PKK has been supported and maneuvered by France since 1984, and PKK’s demands for Kurdistan’s ‘independence’ have always met France’s sympathies despite the outright majority of the non Kurdish populations that the PKK claims as Kurds Have repeatedly rejected this perspective, enjoying their status of Turkish citizens. Turkey blames the group for 30,000 deaths since then. With Turkey’ ongoing military campaign against the PKK in plain action, with some of the Iraqi Kurds overtly supporting the PKK, with the terrible oppression exercised by some tyrannical Iraqi Kurdish groups over various Iraqi minorities in the area of Iraqi Kurdistan (Turkmens, Aramaeans, Yazidis, Armenians, Circassians, and others), and with the fanatic but naïve Turkish premier saying in an interview with the private NTV news channel that Iraq, the US and Turkey should carry out a joint operation against the PKK, one understands the volatility of the situation. If one takes into consideration that the US has warned Ankara that sending troops into Iraq would complicate the situation, one can get the use of the situation that the paranoid anti-Turkish US lobbying and the secretive, racist, European Freemasonic lodges may attempt to make. The forthcoming Turkish elections and the US way to help Erdogan If we place the aforementioned within the context of the forthcoming elections, we get a clear idea of what may soon be attempted. As it happens, with the Turkish opposition uniformed into three anti-Islamist parties, an ultra-nationalist (expected to gather 15 to 20%), a conservative (estimated at 10 to 15%), and a social-democratic (projected to reach 25 to 30%), the loathsome Islamists have no chance to achieve majority in the new parliament. Their efforts to either elect an Islamic terrorist as president or to modify the constitution will therefore fail, and normally a tripartite coalition will run the country, re-launching Mustafa Kemal Ataturk’s programs and projects. This would be disastrous for the anti-Turkish side of the EU; they will not be in a position to demonize Turks as Muslims (who supposedly do not drink alcohol during dinners and lunches at Brussels) to later illustrate them as non European and fanatic radicals. It will also be disastrous for the anti-Turkish US lobbying because action will be drastically taken. So, the EU and US forces that support Erdogan must act now; tomorrow it will be very late, and they will not find an imbecile as Turkish premier. How can they help Erdogan to win the elections he is going to normally lose? Turkey to annex Northern Iraq? There is only one king maker in the world: Victory. In front of a military victory, defeat of the PKK and the Iraqi Kurds, possible merge with the Turkmens at Kirkuk, and even more theatrically, eventual clash with the Americans in Northern Iraq, Erdogan would certainly appear as the greatest man in the history of Turkey after Ataturk. An annexation of Mosul, Arbil, Kirkuk, and Suleymaniyeh would be presented by Erdogan as the end of the Kurdish problem, and a deal with Iran and Russia would help him consolidate his grip in view of the pending American departure. This would terminate the negotiations with EU but Erdogan’s victory would mean to Americans and to lesser extent to Europeans that their main obstacle in controlling Turkey economically, the secular military establishment, lost the power in Ankara. This would signal the beginning of a stronger US – EU commitment to Kurdistan’s independence, and to Turkey’s defamation as an Islamic extremist country whereby the Kurds ‘suffer’. Turkey’s inner clashes, Turkey’s involvement in the deterioration of the European states’ confrontation with their Muslim minorities, the formation of an independent Kurdistan, the Turkish explosion in the Balkans, and the establishment of the Russian – Turkish – Iranian alliance would then trigger the most unbelievable political earthquake in Europe’s History. What the apostate Freemasonic lodge was not able to achieve during 50 long years will then be materialized within months. The European Union they envisioned would then rise at last – extremely different from the present one.

In the latest in what are becoming almost daily opinion pieces called ''Reflections of the Commander in Chief,'' Castro said Bush would be wise to listen to his ally, outgoing British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has made global warming a primary focus of his last weeks in office. The ailing 80-year-old Cuban leader also criticized both Britain and the United States for heavy military expenditures. ''Perhaps someone with one of the new computer programs by Bill Gates could figure out how much the war expenditures have deprived humanity of education, health and culture,'' the essay read. ''George should say what he really thinks at the G-8 meeting, including the subject of the dangers threatening peace and food for human beings,'' Castro added. ``Someone should ask him. And he should not try to escape from the counsel of his friend Blair.'' Germany, which holds the rotating European Union and G-8 presidencies, is proposing a target that would allow global temperatures to increase no more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit before being brought back down. Experts have said that means a global reduction in emissions of 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. In Berlin on Tuesday, Bush's environmental advisor, James Connaughton, told reporters the United States opposes the EU's target. He said the United States does not oppose emission goals, but prefers to focus on specific areas such as reducing gasoline dependence and developing cleaner coal energy. ''The temperature target is one that the European Union has come to adopt but is not one that any of the other countries is prepared to adopt,'' Connaughton said. He said the United States favors ``setting targets in the context of national circumstances.'' Castro's latest message came a day after his last one, in which the Cuban leader said Bush was waiting for him to die but could not kill his ideas. Castro has not been seen in public in 10 months, and the written opinions he has released since late March seem to be his attempt to have his voice heard in international debate. The Cuban leader announced July 31 that he had undergone emergency intestinal surgery and was stepping aside for his younger brother Ra&uacute;l, the defense minister. Senior Cuban officials have said Castro is on the mend, but his exact ailment and condition remain state secrets. &#150; All Job Categories &#150; QA - Quality Control Restaurant - Food Service Skilled Labor - Trades &#150; All United States &#150; About the Real Cities Network Terms of Use & Privacy Statement About the McClatchy Company Copyright 2007 Miami Herald Media Co.

Falluja police spokesman Hamid Abid said the bomber, wearing a suicide explosives vest, walked up to a queue of about 150 young men at a police recruitment centre and blew himself up. Abid put the total number of killed and wounded at between 45 and 50. Bilal Mohammed, a doctor at Falluja hospital, said 20 had been killed and 20 wounded. Falluja, 50 km (35 miles) west of Baghdad, is in restive Anbar province, a stronghold of Sunni Arab insurgency. Recruitment centers for Iraqi security forces are common targets for such attacks, which are mostly blamed on Sunni Islamist al Qaeda. Some Sunni Arab tribes in Anbar have been encouraging young men to join the Iraqi security forces in Anbar as part of a new strategy to combat al Qaeda in the area. Al Qaeda in turn has been waging a campaign against tribes who cooperate with authorities in Anbar. The U.S. military has more than 6,000 troops in Anbar, where local commanders have said that al Qaeda accounts for about 75 percent of militants in and around Falluja. &copy; Reuters 2007.

Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals ACLU targets planner of so-called CIA torture flights SUIT ALLEGES FIRM ORGANIZED FLIGHTS Article Launched: 05/31/2007 01:33:53 AM PDT Mohamed vs. Jeppesen Dataplan Inc. court complaint (PDF) The American Civil Liberties Union on Wednesday charged that a company with offices in downtown San Jose helped the CIA transport three men who were blindfolded, housed in small quarters, beaten until their bones broke and left with mutilated genitals during brutal interrogations. Using flight documents obtained in Europe, the ACLU filed suit against the company, Jeppesen Dataplan Inc., in the U.S. District Court for Northern California for its part in the alleged kidnapping, torture and inhumane treatment of the three. From an office on Santa Clara Street in downtown San Jose, Jeppesen employees take calls from customers planning international flights or looking for weather reports. According to the complaint, Jeppesen helped the CIA get fly-over and landing permits in other countries and provided itineraries and lodging for the flight crews. The flights took people the CIA wanted to interrogate to prisons in countries - Morocco and Egypt - that allow torture or to then-secret CIA-run detention facilities where the U.S. government argues that its own laws do not apply, according to the lawsuit. "These are places the whole world, including our own State Department, know use torture as an interrogation procedure," ACLU attorney Ann Brick said. According to the lawsuit, the company worked with at least 15 of the CIA planes for a total of 70 flights. Jeppesen spokesman Mike Pound said he could not comment on the lawsuit nor could he confirm whether or not Jeppesen scheduled flights for the CIA. "We've got thousands of customers. Every one of them has the expectation of privacy," Pound said. The company, he added, works with private pilots, companies with planes and, on occasion, governments. But during a press conference outside the company's downtown office, the ACLU's Brick alleged "this company provided essential flight information and material support that allowed the CIA" to carry out its interrogation program. CIA suit thrown out A similar lawsuit brought by the ACLU against the CIA for another case has been twice thrown out by U.S. courts after the government said it could not release key information in the case because doing so could harm national security. The ACLU also announced Wednesday that it will petition the U.S. Supreme Court to hear that case on the grounds of a 1789 law that allows foreign nationals to bring cases in U.S. courts, the same law it is using in the Jeppesen case. The men in Wednesday's lawsuit are Ahmed Agiza, 45, an Egyptian citizen living in Sweden; Abou Elkassim Britel, 40, of Italy; and Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian seeking political asylum in England. Agiza was in the process of applying for political asylum in Sweden with his family when he was picked up by Swedish security police and handed over to the CIA in 2001, according to the ACLU. The group reports that CIA officers stripped him, blindfolded him, inserted suppositories in him and put him aboard a Jeppesen-arranged plane on a flight to Egypt, where he was wanted for allegedly being part of an outlawed political group. He remains in prison in Egypt, a country known to use torture on its inmates. Police in Pakistan picked up Mohamed as he traveled back to England from Afghanistan in 2002. Blindfolded and shackled, he was allegedly put on a Jeppesen-arranged flight to Morocco. There he was imprisoned and guards cut his genitals and beat him as they questioned him about Al-Qaida, according to the ACLU. Fearing more torture, the ACLU says Mohamed repeated what his captors wanted to hear in a canned confession. In 2004 he was put on another Jeppesen-coordinated flight and sent to Guanta&#96;namo Bay, where he is still imprisoned. As Britel visited Iran and Pakistan on a research trip in 2001, he was picked up by Pakistani police in Lahore and beaten and turned over to the CIA, the ACLU alleges. The CIA placed Britel onto a plane arranged by Jeppesen, the group says, and took him to a Moroccan prison, where he was beaten and deprived of food and sleep. Under stress, he eventually signed a confession that the ACLU says he was never allowed to read. He was sentenced to nine years in prison.

In comments likely to deepen a Russian-British feud reminiscent of Cold War spy scandals, Britain's chief suspect Andrei Lugovoy rejected Litvinenko's deathbed charge the Kremlin had ordered his poisoning with highly radioactive Polonium 210. At a packed news conference in Moscow, Lugovoy said he suspected MI6, the mafia and Boris Berezovsky, a multi-millionaire Kremlin critic who fled Russia for London, could have been involved in Litvinenko's murder. "The main role was played by British secret services and their agent Berezovsky," a confident and combative Lugovoy, himself a former KGB agent, told a news conference aired live on state television. "The poisoning of Litvinenko could not have been but under the control of British secret services," he said. Asked whether he had firm proof of British intelligence involvement in the murder, Lugovoy replied: "Yes". But Britain hit back by saying its request for Lugovoy's extradition from Russia -- which Moscow said it could not meet -- had nothing to do with MI6. "This is a criminal matter and is not an issue about intelligence," a Foreign Office spokesman said. "A British citizen was killed in London and UK citizens and visitors were put at risk." Looking tanned and dressed in a dapper pink shirt, Lugovoy said the Kremlin's enemies and the Western press were portraying him as a "Russian James Bond" in a campaign to tarnish Russia's image. &copy; Reuters 2007.

Bush on Thursday committed the US for the first time to take part in negotiations on a successor to the Kyoto treaty and agreed to set goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The decision appeared to mark a landmark break by Washington from its longstanding opposition to global limits on carbon emissions, although the US plans still fall short of some European demands. A senior US administration official said Mr Bush would announce the new position in a speech in Washington on Thursday morning. Mr Bush was expected to pledge to work with several other large economies, including China and India, to agree a â€œlong-term goalâ€ for reduction in emissions, together with strategies for achieving the target, within 18 months â€“ before he leaves office in January 2009. The official said the US would seek to convene a conference to set the process in motion, possibly as early as this autumn. The process would complement broader international efforts to agree a replacement for the Kyoto protocol on carbon emissions when it expires in 2012, said the official. Washington refused to sign up to the Kyoto treaty and had until Thursday appeared unwilling to engage in negotiations about its successor. The policy shift came less than a week before Mr Bush travels to Germany for the annual of industrialised nations, where climate change is expected to be high on the agenda. Mr Bush has faced years of pressure from European leaders to increase US co-operation with international efforts to tackle global warming. The US was sending a â€œlong-term signal that we want to reduce greenhouse gases significantly,â€ said the administration official. He warned that the US and Europe remained at odds over European calls for an attempt to limit global temperature increases to a certain target. But he said transatlantic agreement on climate change now far outweighed the disagreement.

VOA's Al Pessin reports from the Pentagon officials say the increased tempo of U.S. military operations in Iraq is responsible for some progress toward establishing security in Baghdad, but also for the high U.S. death toll this month. As of late Wednesday, the Pentagon reports that 115 U.S. troops have been killed so far in Iraq in May, with one more day left to go, making the month one of the deadliest of the war for U.S. forces. "It's been a tough month," said Brigadier General Perry Wiggins. At a Pentagon news conference, General Wiggins said the greater risks of the new Baghdad Security Plan were known in advance, and he said the increased presence of U.S. troops in the city's neighborhoods is creating progress, as well as casualties. "We're moving into places where we haven't been, not necessarily (ever) before but we haven't been and stayed with the frequency that we're staying in these areas now. And there are some areas where, in the past, the enemy elected to just move on out, wait until we departed and come back in. In this particular case, they're finding that harder to do," he said. General Wiggins said commanders are "starting to see a shift of momentum" with more support from ordinary Iraqis and a 50 percent decrease in insurgent attacks in western al-Anbar Province. But he also acknowledged what he called a slight increase in attacks in Baghdad. He could not immediately provide specific figures for either location, but the general said insurgents continue to be able to carry out dramatic, large-scale bombing attacks, and also to hit U.S. and Iraqi targets with smaller bombs. The general charged that Iranian operatives are providing technology and training to some Iraqi insurgents, and that some of the training is done by the elite Iranian Quds Force inside Iraq. But he said the U.S. military still has not determined which, if any, senior Iranian officials are behind the effort.

A hurricane research team has renewed its forecast for an "above average" 2007 Atlantic storm season. REUTERS/Carlos Barria MIAMI (Reuters) - The Colorado State University hurricane research team renewed its forecast for an "above average" 2007 Atlantic storm season on Thursday and predicted 17 tropical storms, with nine growing to hurricane strength. Of those, five would grow into major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher with winds over 110 mph (177 kph), the team founded by forecast pioneer William Gray said in its revised forecast. The updated forecast issued on Thursday was unchanged from the team's April 3 forecast for the six-month storm season that starts on Friday. ADVERTISEMENT (article continues below) The researchers said there was a 74 percent chance that at least one major hurricane would hit the U.S. coastline in 2007, with a 50 percent chance that would happen on the U.S. Atlantic Coast and a 49 percent chance on the Gulf of Mexico coast. An average season brings 11 tropical storms, with six reaching hurricane wind speed of 74 mph (119 kph) and two growing into major hurricanes. Other private and government weather researchers have also predicted a more active season than average. But so far none have forecast anything like a repeat of record-breaking 2005, when 28 tropical storms spawned 15 hurricanes, including Katrina which flooded New Orleans and parts of the Gulf coast.

In an article to be published Wednesday, in Cuba's state-run newspaper, Granma, Mr. Castro says those attending the meeting should ask the U.S. leader how he really feels about climate change and other dangers threatening peace and basic human needs, such as food. He also said that he should not try to escape the question with the help of his friend, British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Leaders from the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia will attend the three-day Group of Eight summit in Germany beginning June 6. Cuba's 80-year-old leader has not appeared in public since temporarily handing power to his brother, Raul, last July. However, Cuban media have released photographs and video of the president, and he has published several editorials. Some information for this report was provided by AFP and AP.

The U.K. applied Monday for the extradition of Lugovoi, a former security officer turned businessman, saying it had enough evidence to charge him with the murder of Litvinenko, Berezovsky&#39;s associate who died of radioactive poisoning in London in November. "Today I would like to make an announcement, which should shed some light on this dark political story, where the main roles were played by the British secret service and their agents Berezovsky and the late Litvinenko," Lugovoi told a Moscow news conference, adding that British intelligence had also approached him with an offer of cooperation. Russian prosecutors have refused to extradite Lugovoi, saying it was against Russian law. Moscow has also been fruitlessly seeking the extradition of Berezovsky, accused of fraud at home, from Britain where he has been based since 2001 and became a British citizen in 2003. The British Embassy in Moscow responded to Lugovoi&#39;s allegations by saying the Litvinenko case was a criminal case rather than an intelligence issue. The embassy spokesman said the U.K. was waiting for an official and constructive response from Russia regarding the extradition request. The spokesman said a British citizen had been murdered, and other Britons and foreigners had been exposed to danger. The Litvinenko inquiry has discovered traces of polonium, the substance that killed the former FSB officer, in London, in Germany and in planes that flew between Moscow and London. Lugovoi quoted the late Litvinenko as saying the British secret services had recruited him first. "And then Berezovsky followed his advice and handed over some documents from the [Russian] Security Council, which he held as a former deputy council secretary, and became an MI6 agent," Lugovoi said. The businessman, who owns a private security firm, said he was ready to face Russian justice if Russian prosecutors found the evidence supplied by their British colleagues sufficient to charge him. He added he would also hire British lawyers to defend him. Lugovoi offered three versions of Litvinenko&#39;s poisoning - by the British secret services, the "Russian mafia" and Berezovsky, adding that he could prove the British secret services&#39; involvement. "I am very serious about what I am saying, including these accusations," he said. In his deathbed note, Litvinenko said Russian President Vladimir Putin had orchestrated his poisoning, an allegation denied by the Kremlin. Lugovoi told reporters Thursday that the British secret services had been looking for information to discredit Putin. "The British basically proposed that I collect any materials to discredit Vladimir Putin and his family," Lugovoi said. The businessman also said that he and his colleague Dmitry Kovtun, another former spy-turned-businessman and a witness in the Litvinenko inquiry, were victims rather than witnesses in the case. "We maintain a clear position that we are not only innocent or witnesses, but are victims," Lugovoi said. Kovtun, who like Lugovoi allegedly met with Litvinenko in London on the day he fell ill, said in Moscow Thursday that German police could arrest him if he turned up in Germany where his ex-wife lives. Kovtun stayed in her apartment in Hamburg the night before he met with Litvinenko in London. "I have received a letter through my lawyer from the German prosecutor&#39;s office, saying that if I go to Germany, they cannot guarantee that I will not be immediately arrested," Kovtun said, adding that he had no information about any criminal investigation being launched against him in Germany. German police are investigating Kovtun&#39;s possible involvement in illegally trading radioactive substances, which could be linked to the Litvinenko poisoning case. Lugovoi also accused Litvinenko of cooperating with Chechen separatist emissary Akhmed Zakayev, who has a political refugee status in Britain. Zakayev is wanted in Russia on terrorism charges. "He [Litvinenko] was in Istanbul on instructions from Akhmed Zakayev, where he met with some representatives of Chechen groups," Lugovoi said. Lugovoi said the Litvinenko case had resulted in losses of at least $25 million to his business, which also deals with soft drinks and wine. He said he had to quit the company after a Western partner requested he leave as a pre-condition for a lucrative deal. "I quit the company to save my partners," Lugovoi said. British authorities are meanwhile planning to obtain a broader European arrest warrant for Lugovoi and put him on the Interpol wanted list. Litvinenko&#39;s widow, Marina, said last week she had filed a suit against Russia with the European Court of Human Rights.

Thompson, the former Tennessee senator and star of NBC's "Law & Order," will jump into the 2008 presidential race and start raising money next week, supporters and advisers said yesterday, delivering a jolt to a GOP field that some party activists and analysts believe lacks a viable conservative candidate. Thompson set to run, in jolt to GOP field Late entry poses challenges By Scott Helman, Globe Staff | Republican Fred D. Thompson, the former Tennessee senator and star of NBC's "Law & Order," will jump into the 2008 presidential race and start raising money next week, supporters and advisers said yesterday, delivering a jolt to a GOP field that some party activists and analysts believe lacks a viable conservative candidate. Thompson, who served eight years in the Senate until 2002, plans to establish a presidential exploratory committee in the next several days, allowing him to begin collecting campaign contributions. He will make an initial fund-raising push Monday, when a select group of supporters called "First Day Founders" will attempt to raise at least $46,000 each on that day alone. Given his comparatively late entrance, Thompson will have to work intensively to build a fund-raising base and political organization. The current leading candidates -- Mitt Romney, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and former New York mayor Rudolph Giuli ani -- have each raised millions of dollars; signed on scores of advisers, fund-raisers, and volunteers; and built formidable ground operations in key early primary states. Still, Thompson, 64, is hardly starting from scratch. His acting career, as well as media speculation in the last several months over whether he would run, instantly make him one of the better-known candidates. Indeed, he already registers high -- above Romney, in some cases -- in surveys of likely Republican primary voters. Thompson's supporters say he can capitalize on a hunger many conservatives feel for a top-tier candidate they can whole-heartedly embrace. For them, McCain has gone against the GOP on too many issues, Romney's recent shifts to the right on high-profile issues undermine his credibility, and Giuliani's more liberal social positions make him a nonstarter. "Fred Thompson's entry becomes one of the defining events of the summer," said strategist Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign. "He's filling this tremendous void in the conservatives' eyes. He's got a good conservative voting record in the Senate and ran on good Southern, Tennessee values." Thompson has staked out conservative positions on major issues -- he supports gun rights, opposes same-sex marriage, and believes Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion, was wrong. He's also expressed reservations about the Senate immigration reform bill championed by McCain and President Bush. But Thompson doesn't fit the conservative mold perfectly. He has made statements in the past in support of abortion rights, and Christian conservatives backed his primary opponent when he first ran for Senate in 1994. Thompson also backed McCain's landmark campaign finance reform bill, which many conservatives vehemently oppose. And he has acknowledged having a spirited dating life between his first and second marriages. Some prominent social conservatives have privately expressed skepticism about a Thompson candidacy, questioning whether he was an enthusiastic champion for their causes in the Senate. And influential evangelical leader James Dobson, in an interview with US News & World Report earlier this year, said he hadn't seen evidence of Thompson's faith, adding, "I don't think he's a Christian." "The fact is, a lot of Republican primary voters, a lot of conservatives, are looking at the field and sort of saying, 'Hmm, this is interesting, but isn't there somebody else?' " said David A. Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union . "And Fred is somebody else. . . . The question is, who?" In recent months, he has delivered high-profile speeches to Republican groups, put together a nascent campaign team, and visited Capitol Hill to gauge support among Congressional Republicans. Earlier this spring, he fueled speculation he would run by disclosing that he had been diagnosed in 2004 with a treatable form of lymphoma. Now, Thompson faces immediate strategic decisions, including whether to compete in a key straw poll in Ames, Iowa, this August. Success in the poll frequently predicts success in the Iowa caucuses, but doing well in Ames requires methodical -- and expensive -- preparation, something Romney and other GOP candidates have been doing for months. Some Republicans report that Thompson is already generating excitement among party activists. "With all the other candidates, when you mention them with the base, it's, 'I like this, but I don't like that,' " said Brad Unruh, chairman of the Young Professional Republican Federation of Alabama. "But you mention Fred Thompson and, 'Bam, there's my candidate.' " Chip Felkel, a GOP political consultant based in Greenville, S.C., said he's picked up similar sentiments from conservatives there. "The Republican Party is looking for a candidate that has no caveats," said Felkel, who worked on Bush's election campaigns. Thompson, who first made a name for himself as an aide to the Senate Watergate Committee, had been a Washington lawyer, lobbyist, and actor when he ran for Senate in 1994 to complete Al Gore's term, though he won by running a folksy campaign as a pickup- driving populist. He was reelected in 1996 but did not run again in 2002, saying after his 38-year-old daughter died of a heart attack that January, "I simply do not have the heart for another six-year term." He has since played a steely prosecutor on "Law & Order" and has filled in for legendary radio host Paul Harvey. Wire services reported last night that Thompson has told "Law & Order" producer Dick Wolf that he won't return for the new season in September. Thompson didn't discuss any future political plans but "asked to be released from his responsibilities on the show," Wolf said in an e-mailed statement. McCain, Romney, and Giuliani all issued statements welcoming Thompson into the race, but his presence complicates things for each of them in different ways. McCain and Thompson are close -- Thompson helped lead McCain's 2000 presidential campaign, and their Senate voting records have much in common. McCain, who fell short of fund-raising expectations in the first quarter of 2007, cannot afford to lose fund-raisers or potential donors. Some analysts say Thompson's entry would deny Giuliani his status as the GOP's sole celebrity candidate. For Romney, Thompson poses a new threat in the contest for conservative voters. Thompson has also stolen away one of Romney's top supporters in Congress, Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who was with Romney until last week. But with Thompson facing questions about how badly he wants the presidency -- "I have never beaten down a lot of doors in my life," he acknowledged in a recent FOX News interview -- Romney's staff members are convinced that his organization will thwart Thompson's challenge. Thompson's supporters say he has the experience, the presence, and the demeanor to lead the country and heal some of the divisiveness that has rankled Washington. "I think it's a matter of who can best lead the country, who can win the primary, and who can bring together the Democrats, and the Independents, and certainly Republicans back under one candidate," said Mack Mattingly, a former senator from Georgia. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Lee, 84, arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday, his first visit to the Japanese capital in 22 years. Although he has said his trip is mainly for sightseeing and academic exchanges, Beijing worries that it is politically motivated. Lee, who served as Taiwanese president from 1988 to 2000, is viewed by Beijing as a leader of the island's independence movement and has emerged as a radical activist for the island's independence since leaving office. He is the spiritual leader of the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union. Japan switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1972, in deference to Beijing's "one China" policy. In the absence of diplomatic ties, Japan still imposes strict restrictions on high-level official contacts with Taiwan. On Monday, two days before Lee's arrival in Tokyo, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi expressed concerns about the trip to his Japanese counterpart, Taro Aso, when they met on the sidelines of an international conference in Germany. Yang said the trip has "political implications" and may prevent progress in Sino-Japanese relations. In an attempt to assuage Chinese concerns, Aso replied that Tokyo's understanding is that Lee won't engage in any political activities while in Japan. Despite this assurance, however, there are concerns, even among Japanese government officials, that the former president might make provocative remarks against Beijing. Unlike during his two previous visits, made after he stepped down as president, Lee is to deliver speeches and give a press conference before leaving Japan on June 9. Lee has said, "The speeches will be on cultural and academic topics and will not be political propaganda." But the international situation is the theme of one of his planned speeches. Japan expects China simply to harp on its basic Taiwan policy if Lee's visit actually ends without deviating from the stated objectives of sightseeing and academic exchanges. Both countries want to keep the recent warming trend of bilateral relations. But if Lee refers to Taiwanese independence in his speeches or press conference, Tokyo will almost certainly come under fire from Beijing. On Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu urged Japan not to "give any political platform for the Taiwan separatist movement". In addition, it is not clear what activities will constitute political ones. Indeed, Lee is to have talks with people from Japanese political and business circles in Tokyo on June 7. Former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi is reportedly among the political figures Lee meets then. Japan lifted visa requirements for short-term Taiwanese tourists in 2005. So this time Lee entered Japan without a visa. Lee's two previous visits took him to western and central Japan. This time he stepped on Tokyo soil. As the first major event on his itinerary, Lee is scheduled to receive the First Shimpei Goto Prize in a ceremony in Tokyo on Friday. Goto served as the first head of civilian affairs of Taiwan under Japanese colonial rule, which began in 1895 and lasted until Japan's defeat in World War II in 1945. Lee then plans to visit four northeastern prefectures, Miyagi, Yamagata, Iwate and Akita, tracing the route of the places written in the travel diary ("The Narrow Road to Oku [the Deep North]"), written by the master of (poetry), Basho Matsuo (1644-94), during the Edo period (1603-1867). After returning to Tokyo, Lee is to deliver a speech on June 7 about "the global situation in 2007 and beyond". Thaw in Sino-Japanese ties Because of warming ties, officials in Beijing and Tokyo are watchful about what Lee will say and do during his trip. Sino-Japanese relations sharply deteriorated under Abe's predecessor, Koizumi, who upset Beijing by repeatedly visiting Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, which honors some convicted war criminals involved in the invasion of China and much of Asia before and during World War II, along with some 2.5 million war dead. During the last few years of Koizumi's five-and-a-half-year premiership, China shunned top-level contacts with Koizumi, even during international conferences in third countries, in protest against what it viewed as his glorification of Japan's militaristic past. But bilateral relations began to warm up when Shinzo Abe succeeded Koizumi last September and made a fence-mending trip to Beijing soon afterward. In Beijing, Abe met with top Chinese leaders, including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. They agreed to "strive to build a mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests", according to a joint press statement issued then. Lee's visit comes about two months after Wen came to Tokyo in April, becoming the first top-level Chinese leader to step on Japanese soil in nearly seven years. Abe and Wen agreed to boost cooperation in economic, energy, environment and other areas to build "strategic, mutually beneficial relations". Abe conveyed his intention to visit China some time this year, as requested by Wen. Abe also extended an invitation for Hu to visit Japan early next year.

Bush will propose today a new round of discussions aimed at setting long-term goals by the world&#39;s largest energy users to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The president, in a speech today, will announce plans to convene a group of the largest emitters and energy users, including China and India, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, blamed for global warming. ``Within the next 18 months we&#39;d like to see if we can achieve consensus on a long-term goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions,&#39;&#39; a senior administration official said. The president&#39;s proposal comes as he prepares to meet with the leaders of the Group of Eight next week. U.S. negotiators have sought to eliminate climate-change targets from declarations being prepared for the meeting. The U.S. currently has a target of reducing its greenhouse gas intensity, a measure of emissions per unit of economic growth, by 18 percent by 2012. The president in 2001 withdrew the U.S. from the Kyoto Protocol, a multinational agreement that called for 35 nations to reduce emissions 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. ``The president will propose to help lead the discussions on a post-Kyoto framework,&#39;&#39; the official said. Europeans have called for long-term greenhouse gas emission reductions of 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week called for 50 percent emission reductions, without setting a baseline.

Thompson, the former Republican senator from Tennessee and â€œLaw &#038; Orderâ€ actor (though not for much longer). Speaking with Susan Page, he â€œnot only makes it clear that he plans to run, he describes how he aims to do it,â€ she writes. &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember exactly the point that I said, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to do this,&#8217; &#8221; Thompson says, his 6-foot, 6-inch frame sprawled comfortably across a couch in a hotel suite. &#8220;But when I did, the thing that occurred to me: &#8216;I&#8217;m going to tell people that I am thinking about it and see what kind of reaction I get to it.&#8217; &#8221; His late start carries some problems but also &#8220;certain advantages,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Nobody has maxed out to me&#8221; in contributions, he notes, and using the Internet already &#8220;has allowed me to be in the hunt, so to speak, without spending a dime.&#8221; Carl Hulse and Patrick Healy offer their full report on Mr. Thompsonâ€™s â€œtesting the watersâ€ committeeâ€”a step some observers see as too leisurely for an already late entrant. Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster and strategist who is not working for any candidate, said he was â€œsurprised and a little sadâ€ that Mr. Thompson had not declared himself a full-fledged candidate. Mr. Thompson has faced questions about his political commitment stemming from his days in the Senate. â€œThompson will be competing against three guys who have been running flat out for months and working their tails off for well over a year,â€ Mr. Fabrizio said. â€œIf youâ€™re not going to get in this race and double-time on work, effort and commitment, how do you expect to win? You need to send signals that say, â€˜Iâ€™m here and Iâ€™m going to win.â€™â€ Even though advisers have said Mr. Thompson is likely to enter the race in July, reports that he might have to compete in the Aug. 11 Ames, Iowa, straw poll, an important early gauge of support in the first caucus state. Senator Barack Obama and Mitt Romney outline their foreign policy proposals in the July/August issue of Foreign Affairs magazine. The Washington Postâ€™s reports that while the candidates differ on issues like Iraq and climate change, both â€œare at pains to move beyond Iraq toward an overarching vision that will convince an unsettled and war-focused public that this, too, shall pass.â€ Mr. Romney, who as governor of Massachusetts enacted a plan to require all citizens to have health insurance, called on Republicans to tackle the issue during an appearance in Iowa. &#8220;I know the Democrats are talking about that. There&#8217;s no question it&#8217;s going to be pushed by them,&#8221; he said, as reported in The . &#8220;The Republicans have to talk about it as well.&#8221; Mr. Obama called on Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a rival who heads the Senate Banking Committee, to hold hearings on executive pay. Senator John McCain, whose support of the current immigration compromise has been derided by some of his Republican competition, seemed more like he was talking to critics during an Fox News Channel&#8217;s &#8220;The O&#8217;Reilly Factor&#8221; last night than to the host, Bill O&#8217;Reilly. &#8220;Right now it&#8217;s de facto amnesty because we have 12 million people here illegally. It is a national security issue,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got two choices here, Bill. You either round up and deport 12 million people and I know of no one who thinks that&#8217;s a good idea or practicable. Or you make sure that you do everything possible to make sure that they pay a very heavy price for having acted illegally and breaking our laws.&#8221; Senator Sam Brownback elaborates on his views about evolution in a today: &#8220;The truths of science and faith are complementary: they deal with very different questions, but they do not contradict each other because the spiritual order and the material order were created by the same God.&#8221; John Edwards plans to unveil his proposal for dealing with high gas prices today in Menlo Park, Calif. Gov. Bill Richardson and Mr. Dodd joined the top-tier Democrats in announcing they will not participate in a debate sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus on Fox News Channel. The impact of the new primary schedule is palpable in Florida, reports The , noting the increase in candidate appearances there compared to previous campaign seasons. 4 comments so far... While fashions can change, bald guys are at a great disadvantage in this era of hairiness. It is true that Ike and Adlai were bald, but Ike was a political superhero even before running and Adlai&#8211;as talented as any candidate in the 20th Century, lost. After JFK hairified the entire era with his swept-brow woman-killer pate plumage, the world went nuts. The Beatles&#8217; came ashore with their mop tops; ever-longer men&#8217;s hair started racing to toward the floor. Even the rednecks started wearing mullets. Truman said Americans in 1948 would not vote for a man with a mustache, and so it was. Walrus mustaches used to be OK for leaders, but fashion had changed. Except for Sweet Baby James Taylor, the prominent go to extraordinary lengths to keep up their hair. Some of the candidates this year had their scalps treated like crop production fields with transplants set in even rows so that a later crop could yield fruit. See John Edwards. Chaney is bald&#8211;not a good sign for any bald guy. Voldemort is bald too, but that is less portentous than Chaney&#8217;s open sunroof. What makes Thompson think the public will choose him over a full head of hair?, He&#8217;s a man who walked between raindrops during his tenure in the Senate. Like James Buchanan, Thompson has no recent record of his views on the divisive issues of the day&#8211;especially those issues that divide Republicans. This would be clever posturing if he looked like Charlton Heston, but Thompson doesn&#8217;t look like a hairy Moses. He doesn&#8217;t even look like a fourth generation member of the old eastern establishment posing as a Texas hick. Thompson looks like Grandpa Munster or Elmer Fudd without the animation and speech impediment. Better for the Republicans to choose Sam Waterson, with his full head of hair, if their coalition needs a political non-entity to keep it from self-destructing. God forbid that the nation actually pick someone whose experience prepares him to govern and whose personality suggests leadership rather than clever, flexible pandering&#8211;you know, play-acting a part. Why is nobody with a mustache running? Oh yeah, Teddy Roosevelt&#8217;s daughter Alice put a hex on presidential mustaches&#8211;the &#8220;man on the wedding cake&#8221; joke. If only someone could come up with a good joke about actors who seek real world power. â€” Posted by IssyWise Mr. Brownback&#8217;s Op-Ed demonstrates yet again the religionist claim to authority that has no substantiation in reality to make certain things non-negotiable. It&#8217;s a shield for irrationality and unresponsiveness, constructed out of nothing. It is simply a fraudulent falsehood to assert that there is a &#8220;guiding intelligence&#8221; to the universe and you are privy to its intentions, as Brownback baldly claims. I see nothing in either Mr. Obama&#8217;s nor Mr. Romney&#8217;s foreign relations essays that suggests they have any awareness of the damage done to the international rule of law by Bush&#8217;s Iraq invasion on a trumped-up false pretext, and the need for the US to demonstrate to the world that we can contain our own war criminals as we maintain the world&#8217;s biggest arsenal. â€” Posted by Steve Bolger Fred said he wanted to use the internet.

But as Ron Corben reports from Bangkok, the party faithful have vowed to press on, raising fears of unrest. Thaksin Shinawatra react verdict in London, 30 May 2007 Thaksin Shinawatra, now living in London, called for Thailand's military and government to hold general elections soon. He also urged Thai Rak Thai Party members to accept the constitutional tribunal's verdict. Late Wednesday, the constitutional tribunal ordered the party Mr. Thaksin set up in 1998 to be dissolved. The judges banned more than 100 of its executives from politics for five years. Thai Rak Thai or Thai Love Thai Party, was found guilty of election violations and bribery during the inconclusive April 2006 general election, which was later annulled. Jakrapob Penkair, who had served as a Thaksin government spokesman, said the former prime minister considers the verdict too harsh. "Khun [Mr.] Thaksin expressed deep regret that the result has come this way. He himself said that it should not have been this severe. It is up to the [party] members in Thailand itself to fight for rights," said Penkair. "All I can say is that members of Thai Rak Thai will not lay down and take it." Jakrapob accuses the tribunal of issuing a political rather than legal verdict. Party officials say they will appeal. Mr. Thaksin's government was widely popular in rural areas, but was increasingly unpopular among the middle class. After nearly a year of anti-Thaksin protests in Bangkok, the military ousted Mr. Thaksin last September and appointed an interim government, which filed election fraud charges against both his Thai Rak Thai party and the leading opposition group. The government has heightened security around the country. Protests against the verdict are expected in the northeastern provinces, which are Thai Rak Thai strongholds. In Bangkok, party supporters planned a rally Thursday. The Democrat Party, which the tribunal cleared of election fraud charges, called for reconciliation. Media reports and political analysts say the ruling leaves the Democrats in a stronger position when elections are eventually held. The military and the interim government have said elections will be held after a new constitution is drafted, probably before the end of the year. Chulalongkorn University professor Somphob Manaragsan says the verdict should help the country move forward. "There is some clearer picture of the Thai political economic development after one of the deadlocks has been broken through," said Manaragsan. "I think that was a very important step." Somphob also says the public generally considers the tribunal to have been a legitimate way to resolve conflict in the country. But he doubts its verdict will end Mr. Thaksin's political aspirations. Other analysts say party members believe the tribunal discriminated against them, raising fears that deep political divides will remain.

All I do is ask questions Fear and celebration greets Hariri tribunal vote by UN to not show photographer information --> to not show image description --> to not show enlarge option --> Nico Hines and agencies A United Nations vote to set up a tribunal for suspects in the killing of Rafik Hariri, former Lebanese Prime Minister, has been given an uncertain welcome in Lebanon. Cheering crowds in Beirut greeted the decision by the Security Council last night with flag waving and celebratory gunfire in the streets, but some Lebanese newspapers this morning echoed Syria&rsquo;s suggestion that a tribunal may cause even greater instability in the country. Hariri was killed by a truck bomb in February 2005, initial UN investigations implicated Syrian authorities in his murder. The dispute over Hariri&rsquo;s death is at the centre of a deep political crisis between the Western-backed government and the Syrian-backed opposition, led by Hezbollah. There has been no official reaction from Hezbollah to the UN resolution, but the pro-opposition al-Akhbar newspaper said setting up the court without consensus &ldquo;raises serious concern for security and stability&rdquo;. Q&A: explaining the violence in Lebanon Lebanon Army battles &lsquo;al-Qaeda&rsquo; militia Beirut struggles to heal the scars of war &ldquo;The establishment of the court according to an international resolution and without the agreement of a large segment of citizens ... widens and deepens the fracture among Lebanese,&rdquo; Omar Neshabi wrote. Tensions in the divided country have become increasingly sectarian with the most intense internal fighting since the country's civil war this month. More than 50 people have been killed in fighting between the Lebanese Army and Fatah al-Islam, a heavily-armed pro-Syrian splinter group. Hariri supporters denied that the move would lead to increased violence. &ldquo;It is a historic moment an opportunity for all Lebanese to unite... the court is not about vendettas, but about justice for all,&rdquo; said Hariri&rsquo;s son Saad, leader of the parliamentary majority. "Enough divisions. .. Let's put our energies together for the sake of the nation." The UN resolution gives the Lebanese government until June 10 to settle the arrangements for a court in a neutral country. The Lebanese parliament has until now been unable to agree over the scope and remit of a tribunal to study the circumstances of the former Prime Minister&rsquo;s death. The Security Council voted yesterday by 10-0 in favour of the tribunal, but five countries abstained. Russia, China, South Africa, Indonesia and Qatar objected to using Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, which deals with threats to international peace and allows military enforcement, as a basis for the resolution. Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador to the UN, warned that only a tribunal supported by all Lebanese factions would be effective. The council's move "will give rise to a series of political and legal problems, likely to add to the uncertainties embedded in the already turbulent political and security and situation in Lebanon," he said. The vote had been requested by Fouad Siniora, Lebanese Prime Minister, who claimed the trial would allow for &ldquo;the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth&rdquo; to be revealed. The UK and the United States were among the six sponsors of the resolution. Margaret Beckett, the Foreign Secretary, said: &ldquo;The Security Council has demonstrated its support for the government of Lebanon and its commitment to the principle that there shall be no impunity for political assassinations, in Lebanon or elsewhere.&rdquo; Reaction to the tribunal from Syria was hostile. Tishrin, the government newspaper, said in an editorial this morning that the resolution was &ldquo;absolutely an American-Israeli one and could never be regarded as an expression of the international will&rdquo;. Bashar Assad, President of Syria, has threatened not to cooperate with the court if it infringes on Syrian national sovereignty. * Town / City Save to my times Also in Middle East Fear and celebration greets Hariri tribunal vote by UN Anger at campaign to woo gay couples on Holy Land holidays Lecturers&rsquo; union votes to back Israel boycott Hunt for Britons goes on amid Iraqi violence Lugovoy revels in spotlight as Russia sezies on claims Woman dies after electricity cut off 'More tender than we could imagine' Where a spell of fame begins with a bee The Times in the Middle East A series of articles on the Middle East to mark the debut of International Edition in the region The restored Hejaz Railway is to be rebuilt as an intercity express Gaza close to civil war as Hamas threatens suicide attacks News and views from Ned Parker and Stephen Farrell Full coverage of Iraq For breaking news stories and detailed analysis Your guide to seeing the very best of what the Middle East has to offer Weather forecasts for the Middle East region Latest developments in oil, gas and other natural resources She relied on an oxygen machine.

The next act is expected to play out much the same next week, when the world&#8217;s most powerful economic leaders meet at the G-8 Summit in Germany to discuss the world&#8217;s climate and what should be done to stabalize it. Europe and Japan want strict caps on greenhouse gas emissions. Developing countries only want to shoulder the burden for their relatively recent contributions to the problem, and they want to see historic polluters pony up. The U.S. stands alone in its resistance to most any action. Meanwhile, states and cities, celebrities, companies and households are taking action. The willpower to act seems everywhere present but the White House. Extreme Weather Takes Toll On Crops Offshore Oil Rigs Ready For Storms Copyright 2007 The Christian Science Publishing Society G-8 to take up climate change Brad Knickerbocker Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor The international squabble over climate change - who's to blame and how to deal with it - is coming to a boil as many of the major players prepare to meet in Germany next week. In essence, Europe and Japan want stricter controls on greenhouse gases and a faster timetable for reducing them. Major developing countries, China and India, say advanced Western industrialized nations need to make the first cuts; and the United States increasingly looks like the Lone Ranger as it resists diplomatic efforts to join in a coordinated plan to battle global warming. The differences became apparent earlier this week when the environmental group Greenpeace leaked documents "showing the United States has raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration" for next week's Group of Eight summit, according to the French press service AFP. Germany is hosting the G-8 meeting in Heiligendamm June 6-8. The G-8 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Britain, and the United States, with the 27-nation European Union (EU) participating as well. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to secure a major climate change deal, including agreement to slow the rise in average temperatures this century to 2 degrees Celsius, a cut in global greenhouse-gas emissions by 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and an increase in energy efficiency in power generation and transportation of 20 percent by 2020, the BBC reported. But the US has raised objections to a draft communique prepared for the summit, reports the BBC and other news sources, quoting documents first released by Greenpeace. "The changes strike out entire sentences and significantly reduce the certainty with which the statement addresses climate change," reports the BBC. In red ink, American negotiators wrote: "The US still has serious, fundamental concerns about this draft statement.... The treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses 'multiple red lines' in terms of what we simply cannot agree to.... We have tried to 'tread lightly' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the German position." China and India have joined the US in opposing strict international agreements to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Said Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, following a meeting this week with EU officials in Hamburg, Germany, as reported by AFP: "Our position is that we are a developing nation, and climate change is not the doing of developing countries, though every country has to do what it can to help the environment.... "China's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world, and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line, so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment." China is not a member of the G-8 but was invited to the summit along with Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa. on the subject echo China's. Pradipto Ghosh, India's environment secretary, was quoted May 28 by the Press Trust of India news agency as saying "Legally mandated measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are likely to have significant adverse impacts on GDP growth of developing countries, including India. [Plans to cut greenhouse gases could also have] serious implications for our poverty-alleviation programs. This is not the path we want to pursue." African countries will not be directly involved in next week's G-8 discussions on global warming. But their interests are being voiced by Oxfam, the British aid and relief organization. Rich countries are obliged to help developing countries adapt to climate change, Oxfam asserts - an effort that could cost at least $50 billion a year, reported Britain's Financial Times. Said Oxfam senior researcher Kate Raworth: "This is not about aid, it is about the world's biggest and richest polluters covering the costs forced upon those who are most vulnerable.... Developing countries cannot and should not be expected to foot the bill for the impact of rich countries' emissions." Beginning with its rejection of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, the US has resisted international controls on its energy production and use - particularly as they relate to climate change. The US has aired two chief objections: that major developing countries (including China) are wrongly exempted from its targets and timetables for reducing greenhouse gases and that the Kyoto agreement would harm the US economy. US officials voiced those concerns this week in Darwin, Australia, where representatives of the 21 Pacific Rim countries making up the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum met to plan the group's summit in September, where climate change will be a key issue. Said US Deputy Secretary of Energy Clay Sell, as quoted by the Associated Press: "Each country brings its own unique circumstances, its own assets, its limitations.... A strong economy is the key enabler to addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions." Along with the US, Australia (the fourth-largest coal producer in the world) has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. At the Darwin meeting, the two countries said they want to discuss ways to develop clean technologies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions before any carbon-reduction schemes are considered. Said Australian Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane: "Once we know how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the challenge will then be to have those technologies employed and to set targets."

"We need each G-8 to be bolder than the last," Blair said in a speech at the University of South Africa. "If we give up, we will lose the chance in this continent, rich as it is though its people are often poor, for our values to take root. It would be a calamitous misjudgment and we should not make it." Blair "has been a very good friend to Africa, and I know his commitment will continue in his retirement," Mandela said. "I know that your energy, passion and youth can still play a big role in international affairs." "One is chosen by countries like South Africa, Ghana, Tanzania, Mozambique, Botswana and many others, reinforcing economic growth with good governance and the stamping out of violence and corruption," he said. "The other, the path of Zimbabwe or Sudan, where bad government and violent oppression send the country&#145;s economy spiraling down." Blair said debt-relief programs have helped countries like Zambia provide free basic health care, while funding from Britain and the West have helped improve education and distribute anti- AIDS drugs to hundreds of thousands. In his speech, Blair called for tougher action against Sudan over the violence in Darfur. "It is wrong that President Bashir, intent on bombing his way to a solution, is determined to obstruct any effort made to reinforce the Africa Union&#145;s ability to improve security and stability," he said. Blair also appealed for renewed pressure on Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, accused by the West of becoming increasingly repressive and leading his country to economic ruin. The prime minister was due to meet later Friday with South African President Thabo Mbeki for talks likely to include the crisis in neighboring Zimbabwe. -- -- -- -- A publication by the News One Publishing Group.

Iran&#x2019;s chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani reiterated that he would not give in to demands that his country suspend uranium enrichment over fears it is developing nuclear weapons. Iran denies that it is secretly developing atom bombs. Larijani is due to hold talks today with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana amid a long-running argument between Iran and the west over the Islamic republic&#x2019;s nuclear programme. Diplomats do not expect a breakthrough. &#x201C;If Iran continues to ignore demands of the Security Council, we will support further appropriate measures as agreed in Resolution 1747,&#x201D; the Group of Eight (G-8) foreign ministers said in a statement issued at a meeting in Potsdam, Germany. The G-8 statement expressed &#x201C;deep regret that Iran, as we saw in the latest report by the director general (of the International Atomic Energy Agency), has continued to expand its enrichment activities&#x201D;. Security Council resolution 1747 gave Tehran a 60-day deadline to freeze all enrichment work. Iran ignored the deadline, which expired last week. The term &#x201C;appropriate measures&#x201D; is widely seen as diplomatic code for sanctions. The council has already imposed two rounds of sanctions on Iran for failing to suspend uranium enrichment. Besides major western powers and Japan, the G-8 also includes Russia, which has backed previous UN resolutions while stressing Iran&#x2019;s right to a peaceful nuclear programme. Today&#x2019;s meeting between Larijani and Solana, acting on behalf of world powers, will be the first since US and Iranian officials held rare face-to-face discussions in Iraq, although atomic affairs were not on the agenda in Baghdad. The US , which accuses Iran of seeking to build an atomic bomb, has been leading efforts to isolate it over its nuclear programme and also says it is stirring up violence in Iraq. Iran denies both charges. &#x201C;Suspension is not a solution to Iran&#x2019;s nuclear issue &#x2026; Iran cannot accept suspension,&#x201D; Larijani said in Tehran before leaving for Madrid, where he will meet Solana. &#x201C;We have no conditions and we are ready for constructive talks but we will not accept any preconditions. We are ready to remove concerns over Iran&#x2019;s atomic issue.&#x201D; Previous meetings have failed to persuade Tehran to obey UN resolutions demanding it halt enrichment. &#x201C;We are ready to hold talks without preconditions, any day, any time, but they (the Europeans) should change their logic and use this opportunity which Iran has created for constructive talks. Previous methods will lead them nowhere,&#x201D; Larijani said. Also at Potsdam yesterday Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned other world powers not to decide the fate of Kosovo on their own, saying talks between only Belgrade and Pristina could solve a row over independence for the Serbian province. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice yesterday dismissed separate concerns from Russia over a proposed US missile shield in Poland and the Czech republic.

's unwillingness to settle aboriginal land claims, the impatience of the and the cultural insensitivity of the provincial police all contributed to his death, an exhaustive public inquiry concluded Thursday. "It is impossible to attribute Mr. George's death to a single person, factor, decision or institution," Commissioner Sydney Linden said following the release of his four-volume report on the police shooting in September 1995. "On the contrary, it was the combination of these that made a violent result more likely, particularly when they all came together in the space of a few short days and hours in the context of a highly-charged confrontation. Individuals and institutions need to be held accountable for the consequences of their decisions and actions, whether those consequences were intended or not." While the federal government has allowed aboriginal land claims "to fester for decades," Linden faulted then-premier Mike Harris for giving police 24 hours to remove aboriginal protesters from Ipperwash Provincial Park, just days after they occupied it claiming it was the site of a sacred burial ground. Despite the report, 12 years later Ipperwash Provincial Park remains occupied. Although the neighbouring land claim of Camp Ipperwash has been settled, both the federal and provincial governments say it isn't their responsibility to determine the ownership of the park.

The Taliban said 35 people died in the helicopter crash in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan. Hours after the helicopter went down, the Taliban ambushed a police convoy on a main road in southern Zabul province and killed 16 policemen, the interior ministry said. Since the traditional winter lull, the resurgent Taliban have stepped up actions in recent months with a series of suicide attacks, roadside bombs and ambushes against foreign and Afghan forces. In an apparent response to the Chinook crash, a joint NATO and Afghan raid supported by air power killed and wounded dozens of Taliban in Sangin district, close to Kajaki where the twin-rotor NATO helicopter went down on Wednesday night, the Afghan defense ministry said. NATO said the fighting was part of a broader offensive called "Operation Lastay Kulang," from the local Pashto language for "axe handle," meant to extend the Afghan government's control into the north of Helmand province. Officials said 2,000 foreign and Afghan troops, including 1,000 British soldiers and elements of the elite U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, were involved in a push to loosen the Taliban's grip on the Sangin Valley. Helmand, a long-time bastion of the Taliban, is the leading drug-producing region of Afghanistan, the world's main heroin supplier. It has been the scene of a series of bloody fights between Taliban and Western forces in recent months. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

The death raises to 32 the number of soldiers killed since fighting between the army and Fatah Islam militants began May 20. At least 20 civilians and about 60 militants have also been killed. The Nahr el-Bared Palestinian refugee camp is ringed by hundreds of soldiers, backed by artillery and tanks, in place to storm the camp and prevent militants from fleeing. The government has vowed to crush the militants, who have said they will fight till the end. Thousands of Palestinians have fled the camp, but thousands more are still inside, along with the Fatah Islam fighters. Sporadic gunfire exchanges have continued daily since a truce halted three days of heavy fighting. The security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to give official statements, said the soldier who was killed had been hit by militants' sniper fire from inside the camp. They said three soldiers were wounded during overnight fighting.

We indeed have a challenge ahead.&#34; With Gov. Charlie Crist in Israel, Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp was on hand to offer a reminder that a tax holiday on many hurricane supplies runs from Friday through June 12. &#34;The overwhelming message we have today is preparation,&#34; Kottkamp said. &#34;You can either get ready now,&#34; state emergency director Craig Fugate said, &#34;or wait until disaster strikes and not have options.&#34; Fugate conceded it&#39;s difficult for low-income, disabled, the elderly and others to prepare. &#34;It&#39;s for the rest of us who should have and could have,&#34; Fugate said. &#34;We&#39;re making them (the vulnerable) compete with us for resources.&#34; The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above normal season, with 13 to 17 storms reaching at least tropical storm status, seven to 10 of those becoming hurricanes, and three to five becoming major storms, of Category Three or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. Of 1,100 adults surveyed by the Mason-Dixon poll in mid-May in Atlantic and Gulf states: *53 percent said they don&#39;t feel vulnerable to hurricanes or related tornadoes. *52 percent have no family plan, and 61 percent have no hurricane survival kit. *88 percent have taken no steps to make their homes stronger *One in four said they would not start to prepare until hurricanes were 24 to 36 hours away. One in five said they&#39;d wait until 24 hours. *11 percent say they&#39;re responsible for a disabled or elderly person, but one third of those said they had no plan for that person. *16 percent said they might not or would not leave even if ordered to do so. Thirty percent said that, if they left, they&#39;d travel not to friends or relatives nearby but as far as they could go. Emergency managers fear a scenario in which cars stuck in gridlock are wiped out by a storm. *43 percent said they wouldn&#39;t wait for an all clear before heading home. *One in five believed it was the government&#39;s responsibility to provide supplies in the first few days, or weren&#39;t sure who was responsible. Emergency managers have said families need to have everything they&#39;ll need for three to five days on their own. *78 percent said they did not know storm surge is the greatest killer in a storm. *Nearly eight in 10 did not know predicting changes in strength is the weakest part of hurricane forecasting. *More than half believed tornados can occur only within three miles of a storm. Actually, a hurricane can spawn tornadoes hundreds of miles away. *96 percent did not know garage doors are the part of a home most likely to fail. Nearly half still believe masking tape will keep windows from shattering. *21 percent said they weren&#39;t sure their homeowner&#39;s insurance policy included replacement coverage. More than four in 10 had not reviewed their insurance policies with an agent in the past year, some in more than five years.

Speaking to reporters in Vienna Thursday - on the sidelines of a women's empowerment conference, Rice said the international community wants Iran to demonstrate that it is not seeking a nuclear weapon. Despite limited U.N. sanctions and a possibility of a tougher penalties, Tehran has continued to ignore U.N. demands to stop its uranium enrichment -- a process that can be used to make nuclear weapons. Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani and European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana are to meet in Madrid Thursday for another round of talks to try to resolve issue. Larijani says suspension of enrichment activity is not a way to resolve the dispute. On Wednesday, foreign ministers from the Group of Eight industrialized nations: Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States, renewed calls for Iran to stop uranium enrichment or face "appropriate measures."

The cases involve allegations of mistreatment of men from Ethiopia, Italy and Egypt. Jeppesen spokesman Mike Pound says company officials hadn't seen the lawsuit and had no immediate comment. Jeppesen is a subsidiary of Boeing Commercial Aviation Services, and Pound says it provides support services, rather than the flights themselves. But ACLU attorney Ben Wizner says Jeppesen couldn't have been ignorant of the purpose of the CIA flights. Chicago-based Boeing itself isn't named in the lawsuit. Boeing spokesman Tim Neale says company officials typically don't comment on lawsuits and hadn't seen this one. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Mr Zoellick (53) would succeed Paul Wolfowitz, who is stepping down June 30th after findings by a special bank panel that he broke bank rules when he arranged a hefty compensation package in 2005 for his girlfriend, Shaha Riza, a bank employee. He is a great defender of free trade and in any case he will not be worse than Wolfowitz. He knows the subject. He is a man who is suited to the task, unlike his predecessor. Tunisian economics expert Rida el Kefi The controversy led to calls for Mr Wolfowitz to resign from the poverty-fighting institution. A seasoned veteran of politics both inside Washington and on the international stage, Mr Zoellick is known for pulling facts and figures off the top of his head. Mr Bush's selection of Mr Zoellick must be approved by the World Bank's 24-member board. Some African leader&#160;today expressed disappointment at the US decision to nominate Mr Zoellick. After decades of Americans heading the international lender, many on the world's poorest continent felt their time had come to play a key role - and then been snatched away. "Look at the United Nations. When Africans had one of their own leading it, they felt so much closer to the organisation," Kenyan political scientist Ludeki Chweya said, referring to Ghana's Kofi Annan, who was UN secretary-general for a decade. "Such an appointment would give the impression that the Bank might just become a bit more sensitive to the needs and particularities of Africa." Mr Wolfowitz - already derided by many as a key architect of the Iraq war - stepped down after it was revealed he had authorised a hefty pay rise for his companion. Despite unwavering support from the White House until the very end, he gave up a weeks-long fight to cling onto his job and tendered his resignation two weeks ago. Some acknowledged Mr Zoellick would benefit from years of experience negotiating trade deals with developing nations. "He is a great defender of free trade and in any case he will not be worse than Wolfowitz," Tunisian economics expert Rida el Kefi said. "He knows the subject. He is a man who is suited to the task, unlike his predecessor." Others noted Mr Zoellick's diplomatic experience in Africa. As deputy to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice he helped guide the Bush admininstration's strategy on Darfur. But some were angered by what they saw as US arrogance.

UN vote: Hariri suspects to be tried Success &#133; cheering Lebanese Government supporters celebrate after the UN voted to set up an international court to try Rafiq Hariri's murder suspects. Jihadists fill void left by warring Palestinian factions Maggie Farley in New York IN A challenge to Syria, the United Nations Security Council narrowly approved an international tribunal to prosecute suspects in the assassination of a former Lebanese prime minister. But the move was opposed by Russia and China, which fear UN "interference" will inflame tensions in Lebanon. The special court to prosecute suspects in the 2005 killing of Rafiq Hariri won 10 votes, one more than necessary for approval. Russia, China, Qatar, Indonesia and South Africa abstained. "By adopting this resolution, the council has demonstrated its commitment to the principle that there shall be no impunity for political assassinations in Lebanon or elsewhere," the US ambassador to the UN, Zalmay Khalilzad, said on Wednesday. Mr Hariri, who served two terms as prime minister, and 22 others were killed by a truck bomb in Beirut on February 14, 2005. His murder sparked protests that helped push Syrian troops out of Lebanon after 29 years. The tribunal is the culmination of a UN-sponsored investigation into Mr Hariri's killing and 14 other political murders that appear to be related. But the issue of the tribunal has deadlocked the Lebanese parliament for months, pitting the Prime Minister, Fouad Siniora, against the President, Emile Lahoud, who opposes the tribunal. The battle reflects the struggle for political control of the country between factions close to Syria, and those who want to forge an independent nation. Many Lebanese believe that internal struggle led to the assassination of Mr Hariri, who had resigned as prime minister in 2004 in a dispute over Syrian troop presence in Lebanon. The UN's investigation tentatively linked Syrian officials to the crime. But Syria denies responsibility and has refused to co-operate fully with the "politicised" international court. Syria's ambassador to the UN, Bashar Jaafari, said Wednesday's vote amounted to interference in Lebanon's affairs. "Definitely this is something that goes against the interests of the Lebanese people and Lebanon as a whole," he said after the vote. The slain prime minister's son, the MP Saad Hariri, thanked the Security Council for its decision in a televised address to the nation. "This tribunal is for all of you," he said. "It's the gate to redemption from this long line of crimes. This is a moment for unity." Hezbollah, the radical Shiite Muslim group supported by Syria, also opposes the tribunal. The group has 14 seats in Lebanon's 128-member parliament and has organised mass protests to oust Mr Siniora. Gunfire and fireworks broke out in several parts of Lebanon within minutes of the decision. The French ambassador, Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, said it might take a year to establish the tribunal, which involves finding international judges, a prosecutor, financing and a venue outside Lebanon. The US-Russia disagreement over Lebanon spilled into meetings of Group of Eight foreign ministers prior to the start of the summit in Germany next week. Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, had a brief but testy exchange at a press conference over US weapons shipments to the Lebanese Army, which is fighting Islamic militants at a refugee camp near Tripoli. send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today Jihadists fill void left by warring Palestinian factions UN vote: Hariri suspects to be tried Maggie Farley in New York Success &#133; cheering Lebanese Government supporters celebrate after the UN voted to set up an international court to try Rafiq Hariri's murder suspects.

Fred Thompson plans to begin formally "testing the waters" for a Republican presidential run receives heavy coverage, with all three networks covering it -- two in depth -- and most major national newspapers putting the story on the front page. Coverage is generally sympathetic toward the new candidate, noting his Hollywood fame and his appeal to conservatives in the unsettled GOP race. Many reports mention Thompson's desire to evoke thoughts of an earlier actor-politician, Ronald Reagan. However, some stories have an undercurrent of doubt about, in ABC's words, Thompson's "lack of legislative accomplishments" during his Senate tenure. reported, "Ten Republicans are already running. How about number 11?" Thompson "lawyer, actor, former senator -- will file papers Monday to begin raising money, the first step toward candidacy. Thompson is expected to announce as early as the Fourth of July." ABC, noting his Hollywood career, added, "But playing a president is a lot easier than being one." In a 2,000-word front-page story, says Thompson "has been coy with audiences as he flirts with a bid," but in an interview with the newspaper, he "makes it clear that he plans to run, he describes how he aims to do it. He's planning a campaign that will use blogs, video posts and other Internet innovations to reach voters repelled by politics-as-usual in both parties." In his column, Robert Novak says Thompson suggested at a Tuesday dinner with "20 fellow conservatives, mostly journalists," that "his candidacy will be different from other Republicans, in both substance and style." Thompson "envisions a 21st-century campaign, using the Internet more and spending less than his opponents." , also on its front page, says Thompson's backers "hope his name recognition as an actor and radio commentator, conservative stands on issues like immigration and government spending, and strength in the South will differentiate him from the current crop of candidates." Under the perhaps inevitable headline "Thompson Prepares For Biggest Role Yet," the also says that as a "plain-spoken southern Republican with a solidly conservative voting record," Thompson "would hope to become the consensus candidate the party is so far lacking." says Thompson will position himself "as a down-home antidote to Washington politics" and will run his "campaign out of Nashville while promising leadership on a conservative agenda that will appeal to his party's base." The Post says his entry will add "a fourth candidate to the field's top tier," since Giuliani, McCain, and Romney "have struggled to win the confidence of conservative Republicans." But GOP strategists "cautioned that Thompson will need a more refined message and an error-free start to live up to the publicity surrounding his all-but-certain candidacy." The New Hampshire Union Leader also says "polls indicate he would start in the first tier of candidates." says Thompson "has been keeping a high profile in conservative circles and preparing behind the scenes to start a campaign. He has gathered a cadre of senior advisors that includes" former RNC political director Ken Rietz and former Federal Election Commission chairman Michael Toner. says Thompson "will have to move quickly to expand his support to catch up to his leading GOP rivals, in a race where several candidates are expected to raise as much as $100 million before the 2008 primaries." Effect On GOP Top-Tier Candidates Remains Unclear focused on "how this affects the already crowded field." NBC (Russert): "The Fred Thompson campaign senses an unease among the top Republican contenders amongst the conservative base, and that Thompson will try to cast himself as a consistent conservative and try to fill that vacuum." Giuliani's campaign "expects their candidate will take a hit initially in the polls that some of their supporters who gravitated Giuliani will go to Thompson, feeling more comfortable with his conservative credentials, but it will also unsettle the race. If you talk to the Mitt Romney people, it says he'll hurt John McCain because he supported John McCain in 2000. And they have to raise money from similar places. McCain says, no that's not the case, he'll hurt Romney, because Romney had got some momentum, particularly in Iowa, and this now shakes up the race and makes Romney look less conservative than Fred Thompson." says Thompson "is likely to cut into support for a prominent real-life ex-prosecutor, Rudolph Giuliani." While some analysts said Romney "has the most to lose if Thompson can pick up the conservative voters Romney is banking on," Giuliani "would suffer too if conservatives rally to Thompson's side and see in him what they have seen in the ex-mayor -- an electable candidate with the aura of celebrity." However, Giuliani backer Rep. Peter King said he "believes voters will see the difference between real life and TV when they are looking for a strong leader." King said, "Rudy had 9/11, and Fred Thompson had 'Law & Order.'" Thompson Likely To Be On Ames Straw Poll Ballot reports Thompson will probably be on Iowa's August 11 Ames straw poll ballot "whether he wants to be or not." While "some Thompson advisers are urging him not to contest the straw poll," the event "is run by the Iowa Republican Party, and the party's members, not the candidates, decide which contenders are listed." Obama, Romney Focus On Foreign Policy reports Sen. Barack Obama and Mitt Romney "outline their respective foreign policy visions in lengthy articles in the next issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, offering sharp contrasts on issues including the war in Iraq and climate change." Obama "calls the Bush administration's Iraq policies 'tragically misguided' and advocates a phased withdrawal of U.S. combat forces, to be completed by next March," while Romney "notes that there is 'no guarantee' that the administration's current strategy will succeed but says that 'the stakes are too high and the potential fallout too great to deny our military leaders and troops on the ground the resources and the time needed to give it an opportunity.'"

Hillary Clinton responded to the lawsuit brought by shareholders of InfoUSA against chief executive Vinod Gupta for allowing Clinton to travel aboard company planes by saying "that she followed all Senate rules" and that her acceptance of this travel did not negate her criticisms of "corporate America's largesse and skyrocketing executive pay." Calling Gupta a "longtime benefactor," the AP notes that "Clinton's campaign has said she reimbursed Gupta at the cost of a first-class flight, typically a significant discount off the expense of a private jet." Brownback Expands On Evolution Views op-ed called "What I Think About Evolution," Sen. Sam Brownback writes, "I suppose I should not have been surprised earlier this month when, during the first Republican presidential debate, the candidates on stage were asked to raise their hands if they did not 'believe' in evolution. As one of those who raised his hand, I think it would be helpful to discuss the issue in a bit more detail and with the seriousness it demands. The premise behind the question seems to be that if one does not unhesitatingly assert belief in evolution, then one must necessarily believe that God created the world and everything in it in six 24-hour days. But limiting this question to a stark choice between evolution and creationism does a disservice to the complexity of the interaction between science, faith and reason." Tancredo Has "Cult Following" profiles "Rep. Tom Tancredo: A Lightning Rod On Immigration." The Tribune says Tancredo's "crusade to have every illegal immigrant in the country deported and to make English the country's official language has inspired a cult following for this grandson of Italian immigrants, attracting white supremacists and PTA moms alike." While his presidential bid "is widely regarded as a long shot, the reaction he has received so far in Iowa shows his campaign can't be entirely dismissed, political analysts say." FEC: Kerry Violated Spending Limits reports a Federal Election Commission draft audit says Sen. John Kerry's publicly funded 2004 presidential campaign "broke spending limits by nearly $1.4 million during his 2004 presidential bid, including some funds spent on customizing his campaign jets." The FEC "could rule that Kerry's campaign must reimburse the government." says Kerry-Edwards lawyer Marc Elias "says the campaign stayed within the limits and accused the commission's auditors of taking 'an unsupportably aggressive view of the law.'" to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. Bush Sees Korea When He Looks At Iraq The White House on Wednesday offered the US military mission in South Korea as a model for its role in Iraq. The suggestion drew skeptical treatment from the media, as well as renewed questions about the success of the Iraq troop "surge." The reports White House press secretary Tony Snow "told reporters that" President Bush "believes US forces eventually will end their combat role in Iraq but will continue to be needed in the country to deter threats and to help handle potential crises, as they have done in South Korea." The reports the comparison between Iraq and South Korea "was offered as the Pentagon announced the completion of the troop buildup ordered by Bush in January. The last of about 21,500 combat troops to arrive were an Army brigade in Baghdad and a Marine unit heading into the Anbar province in western Iraq." runs a brief report on Snow's comments under the headline "Bush Sees Troops In Iraq For 'Long Time,'" while the portrays the new "model" as a consequence of the possible failure of the current "surge." A "resurgence of sectarian violence and attacks on US troops, coupled with little to no progress on crucial Iraqi political goals, is already spurring discussion about whether the current strategy can succeed." David Broder, in a column titled "Endgame Ahead," writes in the that "the end is coming into view -- not soon enough to spare every precious life, but sooner than President Bush and Vice President Cheney may wish. The dynamic in Congress has been set in motion that will bring this war to an end -- or at least reduce the scale of American involvement and redefine the mission of U.S. troops." Petraeus: Iraqis Must Take Opportunity interviewed Gen, David Petraeus, who said, "Everyone is impatient, including the Iraqi leaders. And what we have to see, now, is, in fact, whether they can make the most of this opportunity that our soldiers and their soldiers are fighting and dying to give to them." Maliki Warns Of Iraqi Army Coup Schemes interviewed Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki, who said, "I have to watch the army because those still loyal to the previous regime may start planning coups. Those people don't believe in democracy and for that reason we are monitoring the status of the army very carefully." Bush Team Considers New Media Outreach Current and former Bush administration communications officials tell the US News Political Bulletin that they now believe they relied too heavily on traditional media and the White House press corps to get out the President's message about the broader war on terrorism and the booming economy. "We didn't use the new tools of communication" like the Internet, blogs and mobile technology, said a former key official. As a result, added another official, the President's message was filtered through the mainstream press which eventually got bored with the story and stopped reporting the President's repetitive messages. "You've got to use the new tools. They can reach far more people than TV or the papers," said an administration official. "A video on the Internet or some blogging can reach millions and we should have played with that much more," said the official. White House insiders, however, dismissed the complaints, mostly from former communications officials, claiming that they have worked with bloggers and non-traditional media but that the tide has turned against them. The White House lessons are being played out on the 2008 presidential campaign where several former Bush aides are working for GOP candidates who are relying more on Internet and blog-based communications than the traditional TV ads and national press corps. "We've got to learn to communicate in a different way," said an advisor to likely GOP candidate Fred Thompson. DOJ Probe: The Plot Thickens After Monica Goodling, a former Justice Department aide, testified last week that she "crossed the line" by using political affiliation as a criteria for hiring decisions, the DOJ inspector general and other ethics officials have expanded their investigation. reports Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine and Counsel Marshall Jarrett of the Office of Professional Responsibility, "which investigates misconduct within the agency, sent a letter to Congress on Wednesday saying they are also looking into the program for hiring entry-level lawyers and summer interns." The says the "expanded investigation also appears to reflect concerns among a growing number of career employees at the Justice Department who have suggested that politics have compromised the hiring process at the department during the Bush administration." And the says the "widening inquiry is likely to pose an additional challenge for Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales." While the US attorney "dismissals have prompted wide political criticism, improper hiring practices could be deemed a violation of the law." reports it "couldn't be determined whether the Goodling inquiry will be expanded to include what direction she received from higher-ups within the department or the White House. The announcement Wednesday, however, indicated that the internal inquiry is looking more broadly at charges of politicization across the department." The runs a similar report. Pattern Seen In Minnesota Case reports that by the time Minnesota US Attorney Tom Heffelfinger "resigned last year, his office had collected a string of awards and commendations from the Justice Department. So it came as a surprise -- and something of a mystery -- when he turned up on a list of U.S. attorneys who had been targeted for firing." But "part of the reason, government documents and other evidence suggest, is that he tried to protect voting rights for Native Americans." to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. Bush AIDS Proposal Widely Praised In what has become a rare occurrence, a proposal by President Bush yesterday is earning praise from almost all corners. reported Bush "says he wants to double America's commitment to fighting AIDS in Africa." Bush is asking Congress "to authorize an additional $30 billion for his AIDS program over a period of five years." called Bush's proposed funding increase "dramatic." Under the headline "Bush AIDS Plan Gets Bipartisan Praise," the says Bush's proposal "was met yesterday with broad support uncommon in Washington. International aid organizations, advocacy groups and members of Congress from both parties offered praise for the proposal -- even if some argued that the proposed increase is insufficient." The notes Bush also "announced that his wife, Laura, will visit four African countries -- Zambia, Mali, Mozambique and Senegal -- that have benefited from the U.S. program and report back to him on her findings. The trip will take place June 25-29." says Bush's proposal "comes a week before he and other leaders will discuss AIDS and Africa at the Group of Eight summit of leading industrialized nations." Among the few who criticized Bush plan, says the , was Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee, who "said the government should also boost spending on malaria and tuberculosis, and on related efforts that are not part of the program but could bolster the fight against HIV/AIDS, including education, nutrition, water, food security and healthcare workers." Praising Bush's announcement, meanwhile, was Bono. reports "the Grammy-winning rock star sang Bush's praises Wednesday" in a phone interview from Morocco. reports White House counselor Dan Bartlett "said the president was convinced America's image in the world would improve because" of initiatives like this one. Jenna Bush's Book On AIDS-Stricken Girl reports in its "Reliable Source" column that Bush twin Jenna "completes her transformation from party girl to global activist this weekend when she starts the promotional rounds for her book, 'Ana's Story: A Journey of Hope.'" Bush, 25, will "appear Saturday at N.Y.C.'s BookExpo America, meeting with booksellers to spike sales and generate buzz." A "peek at the 296-page advance manuscript shows a strong narrative as Bush traces the life of a 17-year-old Panamanian girl living with HIV-AIDS." Pay Discrimination Ruling Under Fire In the wake of the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision to limit employees' ability to sue for pay discrimination, the says congressional Democrats have pledged to reverse the outcome of the case through legislation. The decision is also generating significant media criticism, with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's outspoken dissent drawing positive media coverage. The reports that both in "the abortion case the court decided last month and the discrimination ruling it issued on Tuesday," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg "read forceful dissents from the bench." Ginsburg "may have concluded that quiet collegiality has proved futile and that her new colleagues, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., are not open to persuasion on the issues that matter most to her." says in an editorial, "The Supreme Court struck a blow for discrimination this week by stripping a key civil rights law of much of its potency. ... Fortunately, Congress can amend the law to undo this damaging decision. It should do so without delay." The writes "Ginsburg is clearly right on the policy: It's impossible for every victim of pay discrimination to know and take action within 180 days. Congress should adjust the law accordingly." And the editorializes that Ginsburg "attempted to call the court's attention to those real-world facts." Congress is "left to act because the Supreme Court has read the law so rigidly that it has misread life." to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. The Latest From Late Night Comedians The late-night political shows were reruns last night. to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. Copyright &copy; 2007 by the Bulletin News Network, Inc. 7915 Jones Branch, Suite 6200 &bull; McLean, VA 22102 every weekday at 8 a.m. BEST CAREERS 2007 &raquo; Here's where &#151; and where not &#151; to look if you're considering a fresh career start in 2007.

Blair arrived in Johannesburg on Thursday morning for the two-day visit, the final leg of his so-called "farewell" African trip also to Libya and Sierra Leone, before his departure from office on June 27. Blair is expected to hold discussions with South African President Thabo Mbeki on Friday, and will deliver a major policy speech focusing on Africa, the South African foreign ministry said. He will also meet with former president and anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, and visit a hospital in Soweto, Johannesburg's famous black township on Thursday. The 54-year-old prime minister is expected to elaborate his plan to launch a foundation after he steps down, which will reportedly focus on aid, primary school education, health and fair global trade for Africa. His visit has been greeted with praises on his strong leadership and efforts to set the agenda on Africa during his decade in power. Calling Blair "a great friend of Africa," South African scholar Kuseni Dlamini said he had helped "position Africa's development on the radar screen of global public opinion." He has famously called Africa's problems of poverty, disease, trade injustice and conflict "a scar on the conscience of the world." Blair championed the Commission for Africa and consistently emphasized the importance of Africa's development by designating the year 2005 as the Year of Africa, when Britain chaired the G8 (Group of Eight industrialized countries) Summit. He persuaded his fellow G8 leaders in 2005 to wipe out most of Africa's debt and to double their international development aid to 50 billion U.S. dollars by 2010. Blair also won plaudits for sending British troops to help restore order in Sierra Leone after a bitter 10-year civil conflict. "For we Africans, he (Blair) will remain a figure of stature --despite his faults and detractors in other theaters," BhekiKhumalo, President Mbeki's former spokesman at the height of Blair's premiership, wrote in an article published by the Business Day newspaper on Thursday. In Iraq and the Middle East issues Blair stood accused of uncritical support of the United States. But "Iraq aside, history will judge Blair kindly for his contribution to a better Africa," said Dlamini at the South African Institute of International Affairs. Blair told South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper earlier that he would discuss with President Mbeki on how Africa would remain at the top of the UK's agenda after his departure, Africa's security issues and the crisis in Zimbabwe. He said his greatest disappointment during his work on Africa was that "we haven't yet hammered out a trade deal which is fair to everyone." African countries complained that the huge increases in aid announced in 2005 have yet to materialize and global trade rules remain weighted against poor nations, though the debt relief goals have largely been met. Pretoria said on Wednesday Blair's visit will afford an opportunity for both sides to review bilateral political, economic and trade relations and how they can be deepened in a post-Blairera. "The British Government views South Africa as a major strategic partner in Africa and South Africa expects that this relationship will be consolidated by Prime Minister Blair's successor," Foreign Ministry spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said. Bheki Khumalo also said: "As Africans, we look to Blair's equally able successor, who will build on this prime minister's strong bequest, and perhaps even strengthen it."

http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/law-and-order-tough-man-eyes-presidential-role/2007/05/31/1180205426510.html&cid Law and Order tough man eyes presidential role - World - theage.com.au Welcome to The Age. Law and Order tough man eyes presidential role Thompson: Former senator and actor. AMERICANS who switched on their TV last night saw Fred Thompson, the tough-minded district attorney known as Arthur Branch, tell his colleagues to stick with their instincts on a case. But in real life Fred Thompson wants Americans to believe he'll bring those same leadership qualities to the highest office in the land: the presidency of the United States of America. After much speculation, Thompson, 64, has given his clearest signal yet that he will contest the Republican race. While he has stopped short of setting up an exploratory committee &#151; the formal step requiring lodgement of papers &#151; he told a conference of 100 supporters on Tuesday that he would "test the waters" and begin raising money and employing staff as early as today. Thompson, who in real life served as a Republican senator for Tennessee from 1994 to 2003, plans to run his campaign out of Nashville and has promised a conservative agenda, in line with fellow actor-turned-president Ronald Reagan. Thompson's entry is expected to have an immediate impact on the battle for the race for the Republican nomination, adding a fourth candidate to the field's top tier, which includes former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Senator John McCain of Arizona and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. All three have struggled to win the confidence of conservative Republicans. Thompson will attempt to make the case that he is the true heir to the mantle of Mr Reagan and, if successful, would become a formidable candidate for the nomination. Even though he has not yet entered the race, a CNN/Opinion Research Corp poll conducted on May 4-6 placed Thompson third among Republican candidates with 13 per cent of the vote. Mr Giuliani had the most support with 25 per cent, two percentage points ahead of Senator McCain. Mr Romney was fourth with 10 per cent. However, Mr Romney has gained ground in more recent polls and is now edging up on Senator McCain. Having left it relatively late to enter the race, Thompson now needs an error-free run and a strong start in key states such as Iowa and New Hampshire to gain the momentum he needs. "That's what the campaign will be all about for him &#151; persuading a significant portion of the party that he truly is the right leader for a set of issues and an outlook on the world," said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. An announcement could come as soon as the first week of July. As a lawmaker in the Senate, Thompson exuded a folksy charm but did not set the world on fire. But his decades of movie and television appearances will give him an immediate national presence. he will not return in September, although he did not indicate any political intentions, producer Dick Wolf said in a statement. Republican strategists predicted that Thompson would get an immediate boost in the polls by entering the race. When you see news happening: SMS/MMS: 0406 THE AGE (0406 843 243), or us.

A similar situation across the border, in northern , has added to 's concerns, especially after the 1991 Gulf War, which had weakened 's grip on the Kurdish mountainous north. The U.S.-led invasion of in 2003 gave the de facto autonomy of the Iraqi-Kurdish region a further boost. The new Iraqi constitution acknowledged the creation of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). The last few days have seen yet another milestone in the history of 's Kurdish region, when the handed over security in the region to the Kurdish Peshmarga forces. has two concerns," explains Cameron Brown, deputy director of the "Its first fear is that PKK ( Kurdish Worker's Party) terrorists will use as a safe haven, from which they will conduct attacks on itself. This fear is entirely justified, as this is what has actually happened in the past few years, since the PKK ended its cease-fire and reignited its attacks on Turkish military and civilian targets. 's second concern is that should the Kurds in eventually become independent, it will embolden Kurdish separatism in southeast Last Tuesday's terror attack in the Turkish capital Ankara in which six people were killed and more than 100 were wounded was met with much fury in the Turkish street as well as in the cabinet. 's immediate response to the latest of a long series of Kurdish attacks was to increase its military build-up close to its border with . Twenty more tanks were sent to the border region, where the army is already engaged in an offensive against PKK rebels &ndash; still within has threatened a number of times in the past few months that it would invade if the latter did not put an end to PKK infiltrations. "The PKK must be eliminated as a problem between 's special envoy to , Oguz Celikkol, told CNN-Turk television station on Wednesday. "The [Iraqi] Kurds are fairly powerful, with about 70,000 fighters, probably the largest single most unified paramilitary force inside This paramilitary force is, however, no match for the Turkish army that could easily field 100,000 solders with the most advanced equipment, Brown adds. position regarding a Turkish invasion four years ago, it held preliminary discussions with its allies in the region, including , which asked to send 50,000 soldiers into to ensure the Kurds did not declare independence. , according to Brown, has strongly resisted the Turkish request. Such a move was likely to make the already impossible situation in even harder for the , as its two best allies &ndash; the Kurds and the Turks &ndash; are in conflict with each other. In the event that might have to take sides, and that would be awful for relations with the other side," says Brown. But this might well be the case if the KRG decides to take one more step and declare independence, or if the PKK launches more deadly attacks at the heart of does not wish to anger its ally, the It also has no desire to implicate itself in a protracted war in an inhospitable mountainous region, unless it absolutely has to. That is why 's Prime Minister Recep Teyyip Erdogan urged the on Tuesday to deal with the PKK bases in northern and to destroy them. Aware of the public's &ndash; as well the army's &ndash; unrest following the terror attack in , Erdogan did not rule out a unilateral cross-border Turkish operation. Meanwhile, adding fuel to the fire, a group of PKK gunmen attempted to cross the border into on Wednesday night. The Turkish security forces spotted them and opened fire in their direction. Two Turkish F-16 aircrafts were seen patrolling the region later on, as the border becomes increasingly agitated. Copyright © 2007 The Media Line.

http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7007506056&cid AHN | U.S. Military Says The Death Of Guantanamo Detainee Was Apparently A Suicide | May 31, 2007 global news for the digital world U.S. Military Says The Death Of Guantanamo Detainee Was Apparently A Suicide May 31, 2007 11:54 a.m. EST Shaveta Bansal - AHN Staff Writer Guantanamo, Cuba (AHN) - The U.S Military said that the Saudi Arabian detainee who was found dead in his cell at the Guanatanamo Bay prison facility in Cuba on Wednesday apparently committed suicide. If proved, it would be the fourth suicide case at the prison since it was opened following the September 11 terror attacks. In a statement released on its Website, the U.S. military's Southern Command said that the detainee was found unresponsive and not breathing in his cell by guards. A physician pronounced the detainee dead "after all lifesaving measures had been exhausted," it said. The statement went on to say an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death was being held and that a cultural adviser was assisting the military to ensure that the remains of the deceased were handled in a culturally sensitive and religiously appropriate manner. The incident comes nearly a year after two Saudi detainees and one Yemeni hanged themselves with bed sheets. Since then, the military has taken various steps to tighten the security at the prison, including removing prisoners' access to light fixtures and other potential makeshift weapons and taking away bed sheets in the daytime, the Associated Press reports. However, critics of the detention facility say it is the inhumane treatment of prisoners at the camp and the surging level of frustration among detainees that leads to such incidents. The U.S. government established the detainment camp in January 2002, just few months after the September 11, 2001. The prison holds people suspected by the U.S. government of being al-Qaeda and Taliban operatives. Copyright © AHN Media Corp - All rights reserved.

''Oh, my goodness,'' White House press secretary Tony Snow said on Wednesday at a news conference when asked about Castro's comments. Prompted to elaborate on whether the Bush administration is concerned, Snow added ''It's Fidel Castro.'' He said nothing more on the subject. Eighty-year-old Castro, who has not been seen in public since becoming ill more than 10 months ago, said in an editorial published on Tuesday in the Communist Party daily that Bush was waiting for him to die but could not kill his ideas. ''I'm not the first, nor will I be the last, who Bush has ordered to be deprived of life,'' Castro wrote. Called 'Reflectons of the Commader in Chief,' the Cuban leader's opinion pieces are becoming an almost-daily staple in Castro lambasted Bush for opposing the European Union's goal for an agreement on carbon emissions at next week's Group of Eight summit, and criticised both Britain and the United States for heavy military expenditures. Castro shocked Cuba on July 31 when he announced that he had undergone emergency intestinal surgery and was stepping aside provisionally for his younger brother Raul, the defence minister, during his recovery.

After decades of Americans heading the international lender, many on the world's poorest continent felt their time had come to play a key role &#8211; and then been snatched away. 'Look at the United Nations. When Africans had one of their own leading it, they felt so much closer to the organisation,' Kenyan political scientist Ludeki Chweya said, referring to Ghana's Kofi Annan, who was U.N. secretary-general for a decade. 'Such an appointment would give the impression that the Bank might just become a bit more sensitive to the needs and particularities of Africa.' The scandal surrounding Wolfowitz's departure especially irked many Africans who saw a clear case of double standards by a man seeking to crack down on corruption in their midst. Wolfowitz &#8211; already derided by many as a key architect of the Iraq war &#8211; stepped down after it was revealed he had authorised a hefty pay rise for his companion. Despite unwavering support from the White House until the very end, he gave up a weeks-long fight to cling onto his job and tendered his resignation two weeks ago. Some acknowledged Zoellick, whom President George W. Bush was due to nominate later on Wednesday, would benefit from years of experience negotiating trade deals with developing nations. 'He is a great defender of free trade and in any case he will not be worse than Wolfowitz,' Tunisian economics expert Rida el Kefi told Reuters. 'He knows the subject. He is a man who is suited to the task, unlike his predecessor.' Others noted Zoellick's diplomatic experience in Africa. As deputy to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice he helped guide the Bush admininstration's strategy on Darfur. But some were angered by what they saw as U.S. arrogance. 'Why should the chairman of the World Bank always be an American? It's called the World Bank not the Bank of America,' said Moroccan entrepreneur Hassan Cherif. The White House appeared determined to retain political control, he charged. 'I don't think it is a democratic process, but the United States have their own definition of democracy anyway,' Cherif added. 'They use it when it suits them and ignore it when it goes against their interests.' Some lamented what they saw as a missed opportunity. 'It has been the same since the Second World War,' said one woman working for Kenya's government who asked not to be named.

For this to happen, he explained, wealthy nations must hold on to the path set out in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and at the Gleneagles G8 meeting (2005) amongst others. Mr Blair was speaking at the Unisa School of Business Leadership, during his last visit to the country as Prime Minister. Africa must take its responsibilities seriously and to develop in the way the New Partnership for Africa&#39;s Development (NEPAD) and the G8 partnership provided, explained Mr Blair. He told the gathering that the international community had to "commit and recommit" to achieve set goals for Africa because there was now a broad political consensus for Africa in the United Kingdom (UK), and that the same was needed from the European Union. "If we do this, and Africa responds as an equal partner, we will have set a strategic goal that in time we will achieve; and in a continent in which the power of China is rising dramatically; we can work with China to serve the development of Africa in a way which benefits us all. "But if we give up, we will lose the chance in this continent - rich as it is though its people are poor - for our values to take root. It will be a calamitous misjudgement and we should not do it," the Prime Minister said. Some of the issues that he cited where the developed world should intervene in this regard were conflict resolution and peace-keeping; fighting poverty; development of the private sector; trade and climate change. Regarding conflict resolution and peacekeeping in Africa, Mr Blair pointed out that the UK had trained 11 000 peacekeeping troops - most from Africa - in the last three years. He recommitted the G8 to training 75 000 troops by 2010, adding that it was for that reason that the UK was supporting the African Union (AU) to develop a stand-by force. "I want to make sure that we here in Africa and the G8 will work together for a mechanism at the UN which secures UN funding for AU operations. "We will propose to our EU partners a mechanism for funding rapid deployment to ensure AU troops can move quickly when required," said Mr Blair. The Prime Minister said the package of commitments the developing world made at the 2005 Gleneagles meeting was "undoubtedly" a comprehensive one. Commitments made to the developing world included amongst others: * US $50 billion extra aid per year by 2010, of which half would go to Africa; * 100% debt cancellation; * Universal access to HIV and AIDS treatment; * Free basic health and education; * Training of AU forces; and * Supporting the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) and ratifying the Convention Against Corruption In this regard Mr Blair pointed out that the big challenge was implementing the commitments - getting rich countries and African governments to keep their promises. African countries, he said, had the responsibility to amongst others consolidate democracy; build the capacity of government institutions to deliver essential services; redouble efforts to stamp out corruption and encourage the private sector to grow. The Prime Minister also acknowledged that although the commitments had not been met entirely thus far, a lot had been done in that regard. On climate change, Mr Blair pointed out that the international community - particularly developed countries - had to acknowledge that climate change was a crucial matter. He said all parties - including the biggest producers of greenhouse gases - should be brought in to an agreement to reduce emissions. "The politics are that, with or without the current leadership, the United States (USA) will not agree to the Kyoto protocol without China being part of the agreement," he said, citing the US&#39; reluctance to become signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, despite being a major contributor to climate change. Mr Blair said the next G8 had to: * Acknowledge that climate change is a crucial issue; * Come up with a new agreement that includes the US and China and all countries; * Set new obligations and goals collectively The Prime Minister also challenged African governments to hold other African governments to account over their actions and conditions in their respective countries. &copy; 2007 BuaNews.

Security Council votes to set up Lebanon court Thursday, 31 May 2007 U.N. Security Council votes to set up Lebanon court In a challenge to Syria, the U.N. Security Council voted on Wednesday to set up a court to prosecute the murder two years ago of former Lebanese prime minister Rafik al-Hariri. After months of arguments between deeply divided Lebanese politicians and talks between the Beirut government and the United Nations, 10 council members supported a Western-sponsored resolution to set up the court and five abstained. There were no votes against. In pushing through the resolution, Western powers are gambling that the boost to the Lebanese government's authority and to the rule of law will outweigh any violent reaction in the region. Britain's U.N. ambassador, Emyr Jones Parry, told reporters the vote would "send the right political signal" to Lebanon, a country with a long history of political assassinations, many of which have gone unpunished. But the five countries that abstained -- Russia, China, Qatar, Indonesia and South Africa -- argued that the council was exceeding its authority and interfering in Lebanese affairs. "It is not appropriate for the Security Council to impose such a tribunal on Lebanon," South African Ambassador Dumisani Kumalo told the council. The move responds to a request from Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, but the country's parliament has not approved the plan because speaker Nabih Berri, an opposition leader who disputes the cabinet's legitimacy, has not convened the chamber.

Officials confirmed the release Thursday and said the four men have been handed over to their employers. Nigerian officials say no ransom was paid for the release of the hostages. The new governor of Delta state, Emmanuel Uduaghan, took personal charge of the negotiations and subsequent release of the men. Emma Amanzie, the only journalist who met with the Americans while they were in captivity and who covered their release, says they were very relieved. "They were happy but the signs of the suffering they faced is visible on their faces and their bodies," she said. "For them, they want to rush back as soon as possible, to their families in America. They are so happy that they are out. They passed through a lot of things which they cannot just say now. They are shocked, they are still dazed." More than 40 unidentified gunmen, armed with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, seized the men from a construction vessel off Nigeria's oil-rich southern coast. Some Nigerian security personnel guarding the facility were hurt in the attack. Growing violence in the Niger Delta has forced a 25 percent drop in petroleum exports from Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter. Eight foreign oil workers of different nationalities stand together after being released at Port Harcourt, Nigeria, 3 May 2007 Newly installed President Umaru Yar'Adua has appealed for an end to the violence. The new leader has promised to tackle the region's long-standing grievances. Nearly 200 foreigners, most of them oil workers, have been kidnapped in the region since the beginning of 2006.

Troops sent to the site of the crash, which killed the crew of five and two military passengers, were attacked by insurgents and called in an air strike ``to eliminate the enemy threat,&#39;&#39; the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said in an e-mailed statement today. The cause of the crash is being investigated, NATO said. A British and a Canadian soldier were among those killed, according to e-mailed statements from those countries. Five of the dead were American soldiers, the Associated Press reported. The Taliban said they shot down the helicopter, and AP, citing an unidentified U.S. military official, said the aircraft may have been hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. NATO is leading international efforts to stabilize Afghanistan under President Hamid Karzai&#39;s government and rebuild infrastructure destroyed by almost three decades of civil war and conflict. The helicopter came down near Kajaki in the north of the province where engineers are repairing a hydroelectric dam so it can provide electricity for the city of Kandahar. The governments of Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan have traded blame for failing to control the insurgency. Karzai says President Pervez Musharraf must do more to stop insurgents training and rearming in Pakistan&#39;s tribal regions. Musharraf points to the 80,000 soldiers his government has deployed in the border region and says Afghanistan must step up efforts to secure its side of the mountainous 2,430-kilometer (1,510-mile) frontier. The two presidents agreed to boost cooperation in the fight against terrorism when they met last month in the Turkish city of Ankara. Their foreign ministers continued the discussions yesterday in Potsdam, Germany, at a meeting of the Group of Eight industrialized nations. Afghan Foreign Minister Rangin Dadfar Spanta and his Pakistani counterpart Kurshid Kasuri renewed the ``commitment to strengthen cooperation and dialogue between their countries and governments at all levels,&#39;&#39; AP reported, citing a statement. NATO has about 37,000 soldiers in Afghanistan from 37 countries, including 15,000 U.S. personnel. The U.S. has an additional 10,000 soldiers in the country carrying out counter- terrorism operations. Several Chinook helicopters have crashed in Afghanistan in the past two years. A CH-47 Chinook came down in southern Zabul province in February because of mechanical failure, killing eight U.S. soldiers. In May 2006, a Chinook crashed while attempting a nighttime landing in eastern Kunar province, killing 10 U.S. military personnel. Sixteen U.S. Navy Seals were killed in June 2005 when insurgents shot down a Chinook in Kunar with a rocket-propelled grenade.

The military said it detained five people suspected of being insurgents and one suspected of being a cell leader. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 31, 2007 BAGHDAD, May 30 — American and Iraqi troops raided Baghdad’s Sadr City neighborhood on Wednesday, looking for five British citizens abducted a day earlier from a nearby government building, military and diplomatic officials said. The search was part of a larger effort involving the military and Iraqi officials, and diplomats from and the United States to locate the British men or make contact with their abductors, according to two Western diplomats. The operation began in the early morning as troops surrounded houses demanding information about the kidnapping victims, a resident of the area said. Lt. Col. Christopher Garver, an Army spokesman, confirmed that an operation was under way in Sadr City, a stronghold of the Shiite cleric ’s Mahdi Army, but he would not say whether the troops were looking for the British kidnapping victims. Separately, a spokesman for the American Embassy in Baghdad, Dan Sreebny, said that two of its Iraqi employees were believed to have been kidnapped. He gave no further details. In a statement, the American military condemned the bombing of a Sunni mosque in southwest Baghdad on Wednesday and another bombing of a Shiite mosque a day earlier. The statement did not provide a location for the earlier bombing, and it gave no details about whether people were killed or wounded in the attacks. The bombings could not be independently confirmed. The British kidnapping victims, a business consultant and four bodyguards, were abducted Tuesday from a Finance Ministry complex by a large group of uniformed men in multiple vehicles. The men entered a guarded Finance Ministry complex in eastern Baghdad, took the Britons and left without firing a shot, according to witnesses and Iraqi officials. Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said in an interview with Reuters that the Mahdi Army may have carried out the kidnappings in retaliation for the killing of the militia’s top commander by Iraqi special forces last week in Basra. But Sheik Salah al-Ubaidi, a spokesman for the Sadr organization, denied involvement. “These claims are far from reality,” he said in an interview. “Baghdad has witnessed many kidnappings before, and the Mahdi Army has been accused many times, but the connection is not correct.” The British foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, speaking to reporters in Germany, said British officials were working with the Iraqi authorities to find out how the Britons were abducted and to secure their swift release. In a statement issued by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry late on Wednesday, Mr. Zebari said, “A thorough investigation has been launched into this serious breach of security, and the government is in close contact with British authorities on the developing situation.” A Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said he was unaware of any communication as of Wednesday night with the kidnappers. The leading theory among American and British diplomats, the official said, is that the kidnapping was the work of the Mahdi Army. The diplomat said that the British business consultant, an employee of BearingPoint, a company in McLean, Va., had been giving a lecture at the Finance Ministry building as part of a contract with the United States Agency for International Development when he was taken. Reuters reported his name as Peter Moore, attributing the information to Finance Ministry officials. But Steve Lunceford, a spokesman for BearingPoint, said the company was not identifying its employee. “We are fully cooperating with local and international authorities to ascertain facts surrounding this incident and are supporting efforts to ensure the employee’s safe release,” he said. At least one other non-Iraqi was in the building at the time of the kidnapping but was not abducted, possibly because he was hidden in a separate room, according to a Western diplomat. In raids unrelated to the search for the kidnappers, the American military said it had detained five people suspected of being insurgents and one person suspected of being a cell leader during a raid in Sadr City. The raid focused on members of a network suspected of importing roadside bombs and weapons from Iran. One person was killed in Sadr City when a car bomb exploded, an Interior Ministry official said. Meanwhile, the Islamic State of , an umbrella insurgent group that includes Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , claimed responsibility for shooting down an American helicopter that crashed in Diyala Province on Monday. In the statement, the group said its operatives had shot down the helicopter and killed “the two crusader pilots.” The American military confirmed the crash and confirmed that the two pilots were killed, but had not publicly announced the cause, though Iraqi officials have said the helicopter was shot down. Five people were killed and 15 wounded on Wednesday when mortar shells landed in downtown Falluja, west of Baghdad, a hospital official said. In Hilla, south of Baghdad, three Iraqi soldiers were killed Wednesday in an early morning attack on their checkpoint, the local police said. Ten people were killed, including four policemen and an Iraqi soldier, in fighting that began after the police tried to arrest people suspected of being Sunni Arab insurgents in Khalis, north of Baghdad, the police said. The bodies of 30 people who had been shot were found in different districts of Baghdad on Tuesday, the police said.

The announcement, which immediately brought new criticism of the administration&#8217;s detention practices, included few details. It stated only that the unidentified detainee was a Saudi Arabian and that he &#8220;was found unresponsive and not breathing in his cell by guards&#8221; early yesterday afternoon. It said lifesaving efforts were exhausted but did not make clear why the officials had concluded that the death was a suicide. A spokesman at the naval station at Guant&#225;namo Bay, Cuba, where about 380 men are held, referred calls to the United States Southern Command in Miami, which posted the announcement on its Web site. The death comes almost a year after three suicides at Guant&#225;namo last June, which drew international attention. Some critics of the Bush administration said the suicides were testament to desperation in the detention camps. But the commander at the time, Rear Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., asserted that &#8220;this was not an act of desperation, but an act of asymmetrical warfare waged against us.&#8221; The death yesterday seemed to mark the end of a period of relative calm in which officials have appeared to take extraordinary steps to avoid detainee suicides, including force-feeding hunger strikers to assure they receive adequate nutrition. Admiral Harris completed his tour of duty at Guant&#225;namo this month and said at the time that the camp was in a much less turbulent state than last year. Several of the detainees&#8217; lawyers have said in recent months that the psychological condition of many of the detainees was markedly deteriorating. They said that some detainees had begun to feel that they would never emerge alive from Guant&#225;namo, which was opened at a detention camp more than five years ago. Some of the lawyers have publicly warned that more suicides are inevitable. Last night, one of those lawyers, Joshua Colangelo-Bryan, said that if the Saudi death was a suicide it was a public sign of the hopelessness at the camp. &#8220;It was simply a matter of time before this suicide,&#8221; Mr. Colangelo-Bryan said, &#8220;and I imagine it is only a matter of time before the next.&#8221; He said that detainees in their sixth year of detention speak of being told that they have no legal rights and will never leave Guant&#225;namo. American officials have said they have decided that about 80 of the detainees can be released, but that few countries have been willing to accept them. Military officials have said they may bring war-crimes charges against about 80 others. The remainder are being held as enemy combatants, and the Bush administration has argued that it can hold them until they cease to become a danger or until the war against terrorism is compete. The Pentagon conducts annual reviews of the detainees to asses whether they are still properly classified as enemy combatants. Anant P. Raut, a Washington lawyer who represents 5 of about 80 Saudi detainees at Guant&#225;namo, said he had not been told as of last night of the condition of his clients. He said that when he visited Guant&#225;namo in February his clients had difficulty understanding why they were still there if the government was not planning to charge them with war crimes. Mr. Raut said yesterday&#8217;s death should bring a thorough assessment of why a detainee might have committed suicide. &#8220;The conditions that led to this have to be re-examined,&#8221; he said.

Mayton - AHN Middle East Correspondent Cairo, Egypt (AHN) - The Lebanese government has charged 20 Fatah al Islam militants with terrorism as clashes between the army and the Palestinian group in northern Lebanon continue into the 11th day. According to reports, 19 Lebanese and one Syrian were charged with fighting around the Nahr al Bared refugee camp, which has killed 79 people, including 18 civilians. If convicted, the 20 charged could face the death penalty. Beirut accuses Fatah al Islam for starting the country's worst clashes since the end of the civil war that raged in Lebanon from 1975-1990. The fighting began on May 20 as the Lebanese Army began to bombard the refugee camp following a failed bank robbery linked to the group. The Lebanese government and analysts have argued that Fatah al Islam is connected with Al Qaeda. Beirut has continuously called for the militants to surrender. The Palestinian group has argued they are acting in self-defense and reject demands to hand over their fighters. The Red Crescent in Lebanon has said that the camp is virtually cut off from the outside world, with residents struggling to survive. They reported that there is no electricity in the camp; no running water and supplies are running dangerously low. Lebanese Prime Minister, Fouad Siniora, has repeatedly said the army will fight until the group is eradicated from Lebanese soil. Copyright © AHN Media Corp - All rights reserved.

Another 20 people were injured in the attack. A hospital source said a bomber wearing a suicide explosives vest walked up to a queue of young men at a police recruitment centre and detonated the bomb. American troops in Iraq It came as US forces fought a sustained gun battle with suspected al Qaeda fighters in western Baghdad, reportedly killing a senior terrorist figure and arresting dozens of others. A source in Fallujah said at least 10 police officers were among the 25 people killed in the suicide attack. Police said the bomber detonated his bomb at the third of four checkpoints as he stood among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The centre had only been opened on Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The US military and Iraqi army and police were running the centre along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al Qaeda. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favourite target of Sunni insurgents and al Qaeda fighters through the course of the Iraq war. Fallujah is a stronghold of the anti-Coalition insurgency and has been the scene of fierce fighting between US troops and Sunni rebels over the past three years. Meanwhile, US forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al Qaeda gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. The fighting in the capital's Amariyah neighbourhood exploded after residents there called for US help. Members of al Qaeda, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final examinations, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. He said the al Qaeda leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained.

Andrei Lugovoi, accused by the U.K. of poisoning former Russian intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko, alleged at a news conference earlier in the day that Litvinenko and fugitive tycoon Boris Berezovsky worked for the British secret services. "Information revealed by Lugovoi and Kovtun [another suspect in the case] during a news conference Thursday will be analyzed from a legal standpoint, in particular as there is a suggestion of possible threats to Russia&#39;s national security," an FSB spokesman said. Lugovoi quoted the late Litvinenko as saying the British secret services had recruited him, and then Berezovsky. "Then Berezovsky followed his advice, and handed over some documents from the [Russian] Security Council, which he held as a former deputy council secretary, and became an MI6 agent," he said. Litvinenko, an associate of Berezovsky, died of radioactive poisoning in London in November. Lugovoi, who Russia refuses to extradite to the U.K. despite an official request, offered three versions of Litvinenko&#39;s poisoning - by the British secret services, the "Russian mafia" and Berezovsky, and said he could prove the British secret services&#39; involvement. "I am very serious about what I am saying, including these accusations," he said. Lugovoi told reporters that the British secret services had been looking for information to discredit President Putin. "The British basically proposed that I collect any materials to discredit Vladimir Putin and his family," Lugovoi said. In addition, he accused Litvinenko of cooperating with Chechen separatist emissary Akhmed Zakayev, who has political refugee status in Britain. Zakayev is wanted in Russia on terrorism charges. Litvinenko "was in Istanbul on instructions from Akhmed Zakayev, where he met with some representatives of Chechen groups," Lugovoi said. After the news conference, a spokesman for the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office said: "All information on the Litvinenko murder case revealed by Andrei Lugovoi will be thoroughly studied within the framework of the criminal case, which the Russian Prosecutor General&#39;s Office is investigating." The spokesman said Lugovoi&#39;s information would be assessed in the light of other widely-publicized criminal cases in Russia, including the murders of two lawmakers, and two journalists, notably Anna Politkovskaya. The U.K. applied on Monday for the extradition of Lugovoi, saying it had enough evidence to charge him with the murder of Litvinenko. Russian prosecutors have refused to extradite Lugovoi, saying it was against the Russian Constitution. Moscow, in turn, has also been fruitlessly seeking the extradition of Berezovsky, accused of fraud at home, from Britain where he has been based since 2001 and became a British citizen in 2003. The British Embassy in Moscow responded Thursday to Lugovoi&#39;s allegations by saying the Litvinenko case was a criminal case rather than an intelligence issue. "Litvinenko&#39;s case is a criminal case, not an intelligence matter," the embassy spokesman said. "We expect an official and constructive response." The spokesman said a British citizen had been murdered, and other Britons and foreigners had been exposed to danger in the polonium poisoning case. The Litvinenko inquiry has discovered traces of polonium-210, the radioactive isotope that killed the former FSB officer, in London, Germany and in planes that flew between Moscow and London. Later Thursday, British TV channel Sky News cited sources in British intelligence saying MI6 believed Lugovoi&#39;s allegations were a "smokescreen" to divert public attention from Britain&#39;s request to extradite Lugovoi. MI6 officials said allegations that British intelligence was responsible for the murder of ex-FSB officer were "ridiculous."

Six more US soldiers have been killed in Iraq, the military has announced, confirming that May has become the deadliest month for American forces in two-and-a-half years. Six more US soldiers have been killed in Iraq, the military announced on Thursday, confirming that May has become the deadliest month for American forces in two-and-a-half years. Meanwhile, the hunt intensified for five Britons who were snatched at gunpoint from a finance ministry building in the capital earlier this week, in an abduction that has been blamed on Baghdad's Shiite militias. US forces detained two suspects in a raid on Sadr City, the eastern Baghdad bastion of Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army, but it was not clear whether this operation was linked to the missing Britons. The raids come one day after the US military arrested a Mahdi Army commander in Kadhimiyah, a northern Shiite district in Baghdad, according to a US statement released Thursday. The man was accused of "managing operations to murder and intimidate local Iraqis and ordering several attacks on coalition forces," and of training militants in the use of armour-piercing roadside bombs, the statement said. Two US soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb on Wednesday in the southwest corner of the capital, a ward of battered neighbourhoods that has seen intense fighting recently. A separate blast that day killed two others on foot patrol. Another soldier was killed earlier this week by a roadside blast northwest of the capital, and a US soldier died of "non-battle related causes," the military also announced on Thursday. The latest deaths bring US casualties for the month to 119, the most since November 2004 when marines launched a full-scale invasion to retake the city of Fallujah in the volatile western Anbar province. Unlike in Fallujah, US forces have fought no major set-piece encounters in May, but instead have been fanning out through Baghdad and a belt of flashpoint towns around the capital in a bid to quell sectarian violence. "First and foremost, it's been a tough month," Brigadier General Perry Wiggins, deputy director of regional operations with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at a Defence Department briefing on Wednesday. "We're moving into places where we haven't been, not necessarily before." April was also bloody for the US-led coalition, with 104 deaths. Taken together, the two past months have been the deadliest since the March 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. The news will increase pressure on US President George W. Bush, who has already seen domestic support for his war strategy fall to an all-time low and is facing calls to set a timetable for troops withdrawals. May's casualties coincide with a "surge" in US reinforcements, which is due to peak next month. Under this plan, US and Iraqi troops are basing themselves in exposed patrol bases in order to control Baghdad street by street. US commander General David Petraeus hopes that the surge will provide breathing space for Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government, allowing him to push through laws to underpin a programme of national reconciliation. The continuing instability of the capital was driven home Tuesday when a squad of gunmen in police uniforms stormed a finance ministry building and dragged off five British visitors. The Britons are still missing amid fears they have fallen into the hands of one of the Shiite militia groups that have infiltrated Iraq's police. Insurgents also struck an important propaganda victory on May 12, when an Al-Qaeda gang destroyed a small US patrol manning a temporary observation post south of Baghdad, killing four soldiers and capturing three. The corpse of one was later found floating in the Euphrates river, with gunshot wounds to the head and torso. Almost three weeks after the attack his two comrades are still missing, despite a massive US manhunt. The missing men's commander, Colonel Michael Kershaw of the 10th Mountain Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, said that interrogations of suspects had thrown up a number of leads and that the search would continue. "Obviously we have a number of different trails we are following. They all lead to different groups. We know we have some of the people that participated," he told AFP at a base outside Baghdad on Wednesday. Kershaw's search area is a 854-square-kilometre (330-square-mile) sector in an insurgent bog of palm groves, high grass, and irrigation canals dubbed "The Triangle of Death". Kershaw's troops have questioned 1,100 people and detained 104 of them. A suicide bomber in an explosives belt killed one Iraqi policeman in an attack on his patrol and wounded at least seven more people in Fallujah, the US military said. In the northern city of Kirkuk a bomb killed one person while police in Mosul police found five corpses, three in army uniforms.

The 64-year-old, who joins a crowded field of Republican contenders, told newspaper USA Today about his campaign plans, after months of speculation. He is already well known for his role as a district attorney in TV series Law & Order, and has been polling well. Mr Thompson is expected to launch a "testing the waters" committee soon, a first step toward officially declaring. The formal declaration of his candidacy could then come within weeks, with 4 July being rumoured as a possible date. The former two-term senator for Tennessee has already been hiring staff, making speeches and establishing a strong internet presence. Reports began circulating on Wednesday that he had decided to make official his informal but already attention-grabbing initiatives towards running for president. "I can't remember exactly the point I said, 'I'm going to do this'," Mr Thompson told USA Today in an interview published on Thursday. "But when I did, that thing that occurred to me: 'I'm going to tell people that I'm thinking about it and see what kind of reaction I get to it'." Mr Thompson has already been attracting attention with speeches He told the paper that his late start to campaigning carried "certain advantages", not least that his use of the internet "has allowed me to be in the hunt, so to speak, without spending a dime". Observers say he could pose a threat to all three of the main contenders for the Republican nomination, Senator John McCain, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Some polls have put him at second or third place among potential Republican voters struggling to decide who to back in a field of almost a dozen candidates. He has strong conservative credentials on issues such as gun control and abortion and, while he voted in 2002 to authorise the Iraq invasion, he is not as closely associated with the war as some of his rivals. His charisma and ability to perform for the crowds are expected to stand him in good stead on the campaign trail. Inevitably, parallels have been drawn between Mr Thompson and another actor-turned-politician, Ronald Reagan. The actor has asked to leave Law & Order, where he has played the astute, fatherly New York District Attorney Arthur Branch for the past five seasons, in order to concentrate on politics. He is also known to viewers for roles in the films The Hunt for Red October, in which he played a US Navy admiral, Last Best Chance and In the Line of Fire.

U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said it was time for Iran to abandon uranium enrichment work, but EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana acknowledged before he met Iran's top nuclear negotiator in Madrid it would be hard to clinch a deal. "It is time for Iran to change its tactics. The international community is united on what Iran should do and this is to suspend (enrichment of uranium for nuclear fuel)," Rice said during a visit to Vienna. Solana's meeting with Iran's Ali Larijani at a former hunting lodge on Madrid's outskirts looked like a last stab at easing a standoff over Iran's atomic activity before world powers sharpen U.N. sanctions. But no one held out hope for any breakthrough one month after the last inconclusive session between the two men, despite two sets of modest U.N. sanctions against Iran. "It is true that as time goes by, if the situation continues, probably the agreement will be more complicated," Solana said before the talks. "I will try to ... see if we can pave the way in order to get into formal negotiations." Major powers insist Iran stop enriching uranium as a confidence-building precondition for negotiations on trade and other benefits. Larijani on Wednesday ruled out a nuclear halt as demanded by the U.N. Security Council, offering only to assure its program is not a disguised bid for bombs as the West suspects. Iran says it only wants atomic power to generate electricity. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_6026687&cid San Jose Mercury News - ACLU targets planner of so-called CIA torture flights san jose / valley start / stop paper (From the last 24 hours) Prosecutors: Aptos woman lived high life on &#36;1.5 million stolen... ACLU targets planner of so-called CIA torture flights Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals ACLU targets planner of so-called CIA torture flights SUIT ALLEGES FIRM ORGANIZED FLIGHTS Article Launched: 05/31/2007 01:33:53 AM PDT Mohamed vs. Jeppesen Dataplan Inc. court complaint (PDF) The American Civil Liberties Union on Wednesday charged that a company with offices in downtown San Jose helped the CIA transport three men who were blindfolded, housed in small quarters, beaten until their bones broke and left with mutilated genitals during brutal interrogations. Using flight documents obtained in Europe, the ACLU filed suit against the company, Jeppesen Dataplan Inc., in the U.S. District Court for Northern California for its part in the alleged kidnapping, torture and inhumane treatment of the three. From an office on Santa Clara Street in downtown San Jose, Jeppesen employees take calls from customers planning international flights or looking for weather reports. According to the complaint, Jeppesen helped the CIA get fly-over and landing permits in other countries and provided itineraries and lodging for the flight crews. The flights took people the CIA wanted to interrogate to prisons in countries - Morocco and Egypt - that allow torture or to then-secret CIA-run detention facilities where the U.S. government argues that its own laws do not apply, according to the lawsuit. "These are places the whole world, including our own State Department, know use torture as an interrogation procedure," ACLU attorney Ann Brick said. According to the lawsuit, the company worked with at least 15 of the CIA planes for a total of 70 flights. Jeppesen spokesman Mike Pound said he could not comment on the lawsuit nor could he confirm whether or not Jeppesen scheduled flights for the CIA. "We've got thousands of customers. Every one of them has the expectation of privacy," Pound said. The company, he added, works with private pilots, companies with planes and, on occasion, governments. But during a press conference outside the company's downtown office, the ACLU's Brick alleged "this company provided essential flight information and material support that allowed the CIA" to carry out its interrogation program. CIA suit thrown out A similar lawsuit brought by the ACLU against the CIA for another case has been twice thrown out by U.S. courts after the government said it could not release key information in the case because doing so could harm national security. The ACLU also announced Wednesday that it will petition the U.S. Supreme Court to hear that case on the grounds of a 1789 law that allows foreign nationals to bring cases in U.S. courts, the same law it is using in the Jeppesen case. The men in Wednesday's lawsuit are Ahmed Agiza, 45, an Egyptian citizen living in Sweden; Abou Elkassim Britel, 40, of Italy; and Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian seeking political asylum in England. Agiza was in the process of applying for political asylum in Sweden with his family when he was picked up by Swedish security police and handed over to the CIA in 2001, according to the ACLU. The group reports that CIA officers stripped him, blindfolded him, inserted suppositories in him and put him aboard a Jeppesen-arranged plane on a flight to Egypt, where he was wanted for allegedly being part of an outlawed political group. He remains in prison in Egypt, a country known to use torture on its inmates. Police in Pakistan picked up Mohamed as he traveled back to England from Afghanistan in 2002. Blindfolded and shackled, he was allegedly put on a Jeppesen-arranged flight to Morocco. There he was imprisoned and guards cut his genitals and beat him as they questioned him about Al-Qaida, according to the ACLU. Fearing more torture, the ACLU says Mohamed repeated what his captors wanted to hear in a canned confession. In 2004 he was put on another Jeppesen-coordinated flight and sent to Guanta&#96;namo Bay, where he is still imprisoned. As Britel visited Iran and Pakistan on a research trip in 2001, he was picked up by Pakistani police in Lahore and beaten and turned over to the CIA, the ACLU alleges. The CIA placed Britel onto a plane arranged by Jeppesen, the group says, and took him to a Moroccan prison, where he was beaten and deprived of food and sleep. Under stress, he eventually signed a confession that the ACLU says he was never allowed to read. He was sentenced to nine years in prison.

Turkey last carried out a major incursion into Iraq a decade ago, before the U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. But separatist Kurdish guerrillas, taking advantage of power vacuum in northern Iraq, have escalated attacks on Turkish targets. Turkey complains the United States and Iraqi Kurds have done little to stop them. «As soldiers, we are ready,» Gen. Yasar Buyukanit said Thursday, adding that the military was awaiting government orders before planning the offensive. The military needs parliamentary approval for the deployment. Public support for such an operation has increased after recent killings of soldiers and a suicide bombing that killed six people and which authorities blamed on the rebels. Many Turks _ complaining of a lack of help from the U.S. and other allies _ believe a major incursion would help finish off the rebels from the Kurdistan Worker's Party, or PKK, which has been fighting for autonomy of the Kurdish-dominated southeast since 1984, a conflict that has killed tens of thousands. Although the Turkish government promised to back the military, it has been slow in asking Parliament for approval to deploy troops, anticipating problems with Washington, Iraq and the European Union _ all of which have urged Turkey to show restraint and find nonmilitary ways to deal with the Kurdish rebellion. Turkey's human rights records has been stained with allegations of excessive use of force in the fight against the guerrillas, and an incursion would not only alleviate the problem but also likely pit two U.S. allies _ Iraqi Kurds and the Turkish military _ against one another. Turkish intelligence reports say that Iraqi Kurdish groups, which previously supported the Turkish military in fighting the guerrillas, were preparing defenses against a possible Turkish incursion into northern Iraq. Turkey fears that Iraqi Kurds want to establish an independent Kurdish state, which could revive the aspirations of separatist Kurds at home. The Turkish military also said it opposed Kurdish plans to seize oil-rich Kirkuk, and vowed to protect Turkmens living in the city. The United States opposes any unilateral Turkish military action, fearing it could destabilize northern Iraq _ the most stable part of the war-torn country. Washington also fears that, if it supports Turkey, it could alienate the pro-American Iraqi Kurds. On Thursday, military trucks hauled more tanks and guns to the border area, local reporters said. The deployment has made it more difficult for the rebels to retreat to bases in northern Iraq, the military said. But U.S. State Department said Wednesday it had seen no evidence of a significant movement of Turkish military forces in the border. Meanwhile, Buyukanit also complained about what he said was a lack of help from allies. «Turkey does not receive the necessary support in its fight against terrorism,» he said at an international security conference in Istanbul. «There are countries which directly or indirectly support PKK terrorism.» Past cross-border operations have yielded mixed results, with many guerrillas sheltering in hide-outs and emerging again after most Turkish units withdrew. A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the military could set up a buffer zone in northern Iraq to block Kurdish rebels from entering Turkey. Turkey had set up a buffer zone along the 200-mile (330-kilometer) border in 1997, but gradually withdrew the bulk of its troops under international pressure, leaving about 1,000 inside Iraq. Those troops act as monitors, but have not pursued the rebels. «To set up a buffer zone, Turkey needs to secure the consent of both Washington and the Iraqi Kurds,» said Nihat Ali Ozcan of the Economic Policy Research Institute in Ankara. «However, the military buildup clearly puts more pressure on U.S. and Iraqi forces to do something quickly.» The Turkish military says up to 3,800 rebels are now based in Iraq, and up to 2,300 operate inside Turkey. Turkish troops, reinforced by planes and helicopter gunships, have killed 14 PKK guerrillas in operations near the border since Monday.

That's despite Katrina's dramatic damage on the Gulf Coast and pleas from emergency officials for residents to prepare before the season starts on tomorrow. Forecasteres are predicting that the 6-month Atlantic season will be an above-average year -- 13 to 17 tropical storms, with seven to 10 of them becoming hurricanes, and three to 5 of those expected to be major. Nevertheless, the Mason-Dixon poll says 53% of those surveyed in 18 Atlantic and Gulf Coast states say they don't feel that they are vulnerable to a hurricane, or to related tornadoes and flooding. Eighty-eight percent said they had NOT taken any steps to fortify their homes. Forty-five percent still believed the old wives' tale that masking tape helps keeps windows from shattering during hurricanes. But only a small amount of people -- 16% -- said they would defy orders to evacuate and ride out a hurricane in their homes. Public safety officials tell residents to stockpile at least a 3-day supply of bottled water, nonperishable food and medicine. Despite the predictions for a busy season, public safety officials worry that an uneventful 2006 lulled residents into complacency; there were only 10 named storms, and the two that hit the U.S. were weak.

David Ramsay, Minister of Natural Resources and Aboriginal Affairs, announced the formation of an Ipperwash response team to implement the recommendations of Commissioner Sidney Linden in his inquiry report released Thursday. Mr. Ramsay said this was a &ldquo;turning point&rdquo; for the province, which will benefit all Ontarians. &ldquo;The message is clear. Only by working together can we achieve the common goal of prosperity and equal opportunity for Aboriginal people across this province,&rdquo; Mr. Ramsay said. Sept. 7, 1995. A spray painted sign at Ipperwash Provincial Park reflects Natives' anger about the 1995 confrontation that left protester Anthony O'Brien (Dudley) George dead. (The Globe and Mail) Aboriginal Affairs Minister David Ramsay speaks Ontario's aboriginal affairs minister talks with reporters following release of Ipperwash report Sam George comments on findings Dudley George's brother speaks with reporters following the release of Thursday's report Inquiry Commissioner Sidney Linden speaks Inquiry Commissioner speaks with reporters from Forest, Ont. Report a road map to unity, peace, aboriginal leaders say Murray Klippenstein on the Ipperwash Inquiry Report Bob Runciman on the Ipperwash Inquiry Report Storm of scandal to finally clear In the 1433-page report, Commissioner Linden offered a scathing review of Ontario Provincial Police operations on the night 38-year-old Dudley George was shot at Ipperwash Provincial Park. He apportions blame to federal and provincial governments as well as the OPP for the stand-off, and makes 98 recommendations that he hopes will help all peoples reach a path of healing. Minutes before the provincial apology, Dudley George's older brother Sam said he was hoping for an apology from Mike Harris, who was Premier at the time. Failing that, he said it was fitting for the province to apologize for him. &ldquo;What Mr. Harris did was act too fast, and closed off many options including negotiations, communications,&rdquo; Mr. George said. &ldquo;We hold him partially responsible for what happened, because of that acting too fast. &ldquo;We wonder if it might be appropriate at this time for Mr. Harris to apologize to my family, or maybe, if Mr. Harris chooses not to, for the government of Ontario to do so. Maybe that is not too much to ask.&rdquo; But Peter Downard, lawyer for Mr. Harris, immediately rejected calls for an apology. &ldquo;This commissioner has made it clear that no apology is required,&rdquo; Mr. Downard said in a testy exchange with reporters. &ldquo;As far as Mr. Harris is concerned, this commission has found specifically in the report that there's no evidence to suggest that either Premier Harris or any member of his government is responsible for the death of Dudley George.&rdquo; Prime among the report recommendations is a call to establish a stand-alone Aboriginal Affairs Ministry within the provincial cabinet, with adequate resources, and for the Federal Government to publicly apologize to the people of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation for failing to honour its promise to return its land. He also urged the creation of a treaty commission of Ontario to settle land and treaty claims, an Aboriginal Reconciliation Fund, more federal involvement with land claim disputes, and new regulations under the Police Services Act to ensure all government directions are in writing and made public to the Commissioner. Judge Linden calls for the OPP to make a public apology to Cecil Bergard George for the beating he sustained in the parking lot where Mr. George was fatally shot by police officer Ken Deane. But in his report, Judge Linden says the matter goes well beyond Mr. Deane and the Inspector who sent him in at 11 p.m. along with a riot squad and other specialist officers. The OPP as an institution also needs to be accountable and share responsibility for the tragedy, as does the Federal Government, he says. &ldquo;Unfortunately, the issues that were at the heart of the Ipperwash occupation remain unresolved by the federal government to this day. This inexcusable delay and long neglect, by successive federal governments, are at the heart of the Ipperwash story.&rdquo; Politically, the hotbed that was Queens Park after the 1995 election played a substantial role in proceedings by Lake Huron that night. Judge Linden found that Premier Mike Harris or someone in his office did convene a meeting on the evening of Sept. 6, 1995, commonly referred to as &ldquo;the dining room meeting&rdquo;. While he found that Mr. Harris did make the controversial comment that he &ldquo;wanted the fucking Indians out of the park&rdquo;, he questions exactly when that comment was made. It was Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson who said the same phrase the &ldquo;dining room meeting&rdquo;, Judge Linden said. The report also finds that Mr. Harris knew at least one person at the meeting was a seconded OPP officer, and that by the end of the meeting &ldquo;Premier Harris had made it clear he wanted the occupiers out of the park as quickly as possible.&rdquo; The Premier's comments in the dining room, and the speed at which he wanted a resolution, &ldquo;unduly narrowed the scope of the government's response&rdquo; and &ldquo;closed off many options endorsed by civil servants,&rdquo; Judge Linden said. And the Premier's push to have an immediate injunction and to remove the Indians from the park within 24 hours was inappropriate. &ldquo;It is for the police to decide whether and when arrests will be made.&rdquo; All of that &ldquo;created the risk of placing political pressure on the police&rdquo; when, in contrast, &ldquo;the Premier could have urged patience, rather than speed&rdquo;. But he concluded that the sum of those factors did not equate to political interference. &ldquo;In my view, although Premier Harris was critical of the police, I do not find that he interfered with or gave inappropriate directions to the police at Ipperwash,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;The Premier did not inappropriately direct the OPP on its operations at Ipperwash or enter the law enforcement domain of the police.&rdquo; The Commissioner confirms that the natives were unarmed, and that Premier Harris and Attorney-General Charles Harnick misled the legislature about the &ldquo;dining room meeting&rdquo;. Julian Falconer, the lawyer representing Aboriginal Legal Services at the inquiry, said the report was &ldquo;historical&rdquo; in that Judge Linden rejected some of Mr. Harris' testimony. &ldquo;It is absolutely unprecedented for a commissioner to make a finding that expressly finds that both the premier and the attorney general misled the house about the key dining room meeting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is a startling revelation and it is unprecedented that I know of for a commissioner to reject evidence under oath by a then premier.&rdquo; The actions of the Ontario Provincial Police were viewed scathingly by Judge Linden, whose references to &ldquo;critical failures&rdquo; on the night of Dudley George's shooting are wearyingly regular. Negotiators should have been called in first. Crowd Management Unit should not have been deployed at night. And, most importantly, the protesters should have been told that they were safe inside the fence. The police had no intention of entering the park. &ldquo;The CMU were busy yelling commands to each other when the officers should have been yelling these crucial messages to the Aboriginal people,&rdquo; Judge Linden wrote. Ontario Provincial Police lawyer Mark Sandler said the Ipperwash standoff was a catalyst for significant change within the force and that the OPP is one of the most progressive police services in the world in terms of aboriginal issues and policies. &ldquo;The OPP came to this inquiry a very different police force than it was 12 years ago,&rdquo; Mr. Sandler said. Judge Linden's criticisms hit upon many of the people mentioned during the Inquiry hearings, including the Premier's executive assistant Deb Hutton. &ldquo;Neither Deb Hutton nor Michael Harris fully appreciated at that time the power of the Premier and the Premier's office,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Regrettably, Ms. Hutton had little experience in aboriginal issues, nor did she have a sound understanding of Aboriginal culture, section 35 of the Constitution, or concepts such as colour of right.&rdquo; In response to the report, Ms. Hutton said the findings &ldquo;conclusively set to rest the unfounded allegations&rdquo; made since Dudley George's death. &ldquo;Commissioner Linden has made clear in his report that there was no political direction of the OPP,&rdquo; she said in a statement issued by her lawyer. As for the land itself, the Commissioner said allowing the status quo to continue is not in anyone's interest. Among the possibilities they could consider, he says, is the reopening of Ipperwash Park under the management of the Kettle Point and Stony Point communities, &ldquo;for the benefit of all Ontarians and visitors alike.&rdquo; On the question of reopening the park, Mr. Ramsay told reporters Thursday: &ldquo;That is not something I've been contemplating, so let's just leave it at that,&rdquo; Mr. Ramsay said.

The show's creator and executive producer Dick Wolf said Thompson asked for his release Wednesday. Wolf said the former Tennessee senator told him he "has not made a firm decision about his political future," but the show's production schedule would create constraints. Thompson has yet to announce he's seeking the Republican presidential nomination, but GOP officials with knowledge of his plans say he'll make his first formal campaign move soon.

Hariri: No ordinary murder Mark Seddon at the UN in New York Hariri supporters in Lebanon are hopeful, but the issue has exposed deep divisions [AFP] On face value, no politician or diplomat would be against prosecuting a serious crime, or bringing its perpetrators to justice. No politician or diplomat would ever say that it is acceptable to assassinate political opponents and then proceed to assassinate other key figures close to them. And yet, with a multitude of different agendas and principles whirling around, there are politicians and diplomats who are opposed to the setting-up of a UN International Tribunal to investigate the 2005 murder of Rafiq Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister, in a massive car bomb. But this was no ordinary murder, nor is this any ordinary tribunal. who abstained on Wednesday's resolution in the UN Security Council argued that they had good reason to do so. The resolution, supported by 10 countries, including the creates a precedent &#8211; although the UN might argue that it does not. It is a Chapter Seven resolution, which is invoked in cases of threats to international peace and security. It is binding, mandatory and can be backed by force if necessary. It gives the divided Lebanese parliament until June 10 to agree to the establishment of a tribunal. The massive car bomb attack in 2005 killed nine people, including Hariri [EPA] For the first time perhaps, an individual government, in this case the Lebanese government, will be forced to co-operate with a UN-backed court. Opinion is divided in too. The country&#8217;s president is against. The country&#8217;s prime minister is for. The opposition, official and unofficial is against. And yet the demonstrations marking Hariri&#8217;s murder two years ago were so massive, that the Syrian army, seen by some as occupiers, others as protectors, withdrew from much of the country. Throughout the long process of the Hariri Inquiry, presided over by a UN-backed team, countries and people not connected to the investigation have been pointing towards Syrian complicity in the attack on Hariri's motorcade, although this remains unproved. But for those who do believe that there was Syrian involvement, an international tribunal is seen as a device that may help make their cause. However, it remains the case that the forensic investigation of the murder site, where the massive car bomb exploded, have not yet led to any suspects being named. The Lebanese parliament now has a deadline. Yet already some are asking what the UN could do enforce its decision if the parliament fails to meet it, or for some reason does not agree. Others claim that this decision by the UN Security Council will lead to yet further violence and bloodshed. Many Lebanese people ask why their own country is not going to be allowed to run its own tribunal. Questions over Syria's involvement have yet to be answered [Reuters] Although others argue that given the great divides in Lebanese society, it is quite impossible to imagine their country hosting an investigation and criminal court case of such political magnitude. The United Nations, for its part, argues that there is no precedent; that there have been international tribunals in the former , investigating war crimes and in Once again critics say that had more or less ceased to exist as a state and wasn&#8217;t functioning as a state. Lebanon, on the other hand, despite its divisions and despite the terrible damage wrought by last year&#8217;s invasion by Israel, is a functioning state, and a state that cannot agree as to whether the tribunal is a good thing or not. The many supporters of Hariri are jubilant now that they believe that justice may actually be done. They believe that a line may at last be drawn under political assassinations if the perpetrators are brought to justice. But for others in , all of this reeks of outside interference. Others still believe that far from putting a cap on the violence, the creation of an international tribunal may just fuel it. Who is right and who is wrong, we shall see in the coming weeks and months.

Sheddy Ozoene, spokesman for the state government, said the fo ur were released and handed over to the state governor Emmanuel Uduaghan. According to Uduaghan, the released oil workers included Mike Russel, Larry Slake, Chris Gay and Kevin Saller. The state governor said the militants had demanded for ransom for their release but that because of government policy against hostage taking, "they were not given any ransom." The four were taken hostage by local militants on May 9 in Nigeria's oil-rich yet restive Niger Delta area. Since the beginning of this month, about 40 foreigners have been abducted in southeastern Nigeria. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer with a daily crude output of 2.6 million barrels. However, the repeated occurrence of kidnapping has frightened thousands of foreign oil workers away since last year, forcing the oil production to reduce by nearly 25 percent.

The powerful blast, which took place before midday, badly damaged the building of the recruitment center and destroyed several nearby cars. Iraqi security forces rushed to the area to secure the scene while ambulances evacuated victims to the city's main hospital, according to the source.

Andrei Lugovoi spoke in Moscow for the first time since British prosecutors charged him with the crime, last week. Bill Gasperini has more from Moscow. Andrei Lugovoi made a series of charges in the spy case, including that the British special services tried to recruit him. Lugovoi says British intelligence wanted him to collect "compromising information" on Russian President Putin. He says the man he is accused of killing, Alexander Litvinenko, worked for British intelligence. Andrei Lugovoi speaks during Moscow press conference, 31 May 2007 Lugovoi spoke for more than an hour at a news conference, telling a tale of intrigue and blackmail that could have come from a spy novel. He claims British intelligence may even have played a role in Litvinenko's murder - if only indirectly. Last week, British prosecutors said they have enough evidence to charge Lugovoi with the killing of Litvinenko, who died of poisoning by the rare radioactive substance polonium-210. Litvinenko lived in exile in London and was a fierce critic of President Putin. Traces of polonium were later found in many places Lugovoi had visited on his way to and from London, where he met with Litvinenko in an upscale hotel. Later that day, Litvinenko became ill. He died three weeks later in a London hospital. Lugovoi also suggests exiled Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky - another fierce Kremlin critic - might have been behind the killing. Many Russian officials have said Berezovsky masterminded the murder as a way to damage the Kremlin's reputation. President Putin and other top Russian leaders have long denied any involvement in Litvinenko's killing. Britain has asked Russia to extradite Lugovoi, to stand trial. Moscow rejects that, saying it would violate the Russian constitution.

The ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal followed a guilty verdict against the Thai Rak Thai Party for financing obscure parties to run against it in elections last year to get around turnout rules. The court also disbanded three smaller parties, two of them hired by Thai Rak Thai. The ban is a stunning end for a party that just two years ago was the most powerful in Thailand. Its demise began after the military overthrew Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in September. The bloodless coup followed demonstrations by tens of thousands of people, demanding Thaksin&#8217;s resignation.

'Between eight and 10 Fatah al-Islam elements were killed yesterday (Wednesday) when the army responded with direct hits to fire which was targeting its positions,' a spokesman said. Officials from the Islamist group, which has been besieged by the army at the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp since its fighters launched attacks on military targets on May 20, could not be reached for confirmation. In all, 79 people have died in the fighting, according to an Agence France-Presse count before the latest army report of casualties among the militia's ranks. He said the situation at the camp remained relatively calm today but warned: 'The situation around Nahr al-Bared is very unstable, as the extremists keep firing on the army, which responds very forcefully.' The Beirut government, pushing for a peaceful end to the standoff, has insisted the group hand over fighters to stand trial over attacks against its armed forces during the bloodiest internal fighting since the 1975-1990 civil war. But Fatah al-Islam is adamant that none of its fighters will be surrendered. 'The situation is still complicated and requires more discussions in order to close the gap between the points of views of the two sides,' Sheikh Mohamad Al-Hajj, a member of a delegation of clerics attempting to mediate for a peaceful solution, told AFP. More than two thirds of Nahr al-Bared's 31,000 residents have been displaced by the fighting, as relief agencies struggle to deliver aid to the displaced and to residents still trapped inside.

Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Thursday, May 31, 2007 Posted on Thu, May. 31, 2007 Former senator exploring campaign Fred Thompson, from "Law & Order," set up a committee to probe a GOP presidential bid. By Michael D. Shear and Dan Balz Fred Thompson plans to offer himself as a down-home antidote to Washington politics to appeal to the GOP base. WASHINGTON - Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson will offer himself as a down-home antidote to Washington politics in a bid for the Republican presidential nomination, running a campaign out of Nashville while promising leadership on a conservative agenda that will appeal to his party&#0039;s base, advisers said yesterday. Thompson&#0039;s entry will immediately affect the battle for the GOP nomination, adding a fourth candidate to the field&#0039;s top tier of former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Thompson will seek to make the case that he is the true heir to the mantle of Ronald Reagan and, if successful, would become a formidable candidate for the nomination. But Republican strategists cautioned that he would need a more refined message and an error-free start-up to live up to the publicity surrounding his all-but-certain candidacy. By tomorrow, aides said, the now-actor will incorporate a committee called Friends of Fred Thompson and will begin actively raising money for a White House bid. He launched the fund-raising effort this week in a conference call with more than 100 supporters, whom he has dubbed his "First Day Founders." Within the next few weeks, advisers say, a real campaign will take shape, even without a final decision or formal announcement. A Web site will be posted, campaign headquarters will be selected, and a staff will be hired. The signature red pickup truck from Thompson&#0039;s Senate campaigns will be dusted off. Thompson, 64, will give a speech in Virginia this weekend and is due to appear next month on the Tonight Show With Jay Leno . An announcement could come as soon as the first week of July, using the hoopla of the national holiday as a backdrop for the campaign&#0039;s launch. But those plans are in flux and could change, two sources said yesterday. As a lawmaker, Thompson exuded a folksy charm that supporters say could help him capture the attention of many Republican primary voters. His decades of movie and television appearances give him an immediate national presence. Thompson has played District Attorney Arthur Branch on , but told the TV show he will not return in September, though he did not indicate any political intentions, producer Dick Wolf said in a statement.

Earlier Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has pledged his support for any military decision to stage an incursion into Iraq, said the army had not yet asked parliament for permission. Turkey's Chief of Staff Gen. Yasar Buyukanit speaks about his country's position in international security policies at an international conference in Istanbul, Thursday, May 31, 2007. Turkish military massed more troops and tanks on the border with Iraq on Thursday as Buyukanit said he was ready to stage a cross-border offensive to fight Kurdish rebels and that he had already asked approval from the government to do so. (AP Photo/Serkan Senturk) (Serkan Senturk - AP) The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article But Gen. Yasar Buyukanit said he had asked for approval during a news conference on April 12, when he said "an operation into Iraq is necessary." "We have told both Turkey and the world on April 12 that as soldiers, we are ready," Buyukanit said Thursday. Buyukanit's remarks appeared to put Erdogan's government under pressure to seek approval from parliament to send soldiers into Iraq to fight separatist Kurdish guerrillas. The rebels have long used northern Iraq as a base in their campaign for self-rule in southeast Turkey. The United States opposes any unilateral Turkish military action, fearing it could destabilize northern Iraq _ the calmest part of the country. Massoud Barzani, the leader of the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq, also strongly opposes a Turkish incursion and has threatened to confront Turkish soldiers if they enter northern Iraq. Military trucks hauled more tanks and guns to the border area Thursday, local reporters said. For weeks, TV stations have broadcast images of military trucks rumbling along the remote border, and trains transferring tanks and guns to bolster an already formidable force in the area. The U.S. State Department said Wednesday that it has seen nothing to substantiate reports of a significant movement of Turkish military forces to the border. Buyukanit said the government needed to define the political targets of such an operation, referring to Barzani. "Political authorities will determine the targets," Buyukanit said. "Are we going to struggle with the PKK once we enter there or do something with Barzani too?" he said, referring to the main Kurdish separatist group.

The views expressed are the author's alone. BEIRUT, 31 May 2007 (IRIN) - With no immediate end in sight to the stand-off between the army and Islamist militants in Nahr al-Bared refugee camp in northern Lebanon, and with neighbouring Beddawi camp already full to bursting, aid agencies have delivered relief to several hundred families displaced further to the east and south of the country. According to figures from the UN Palestinian relief organisation UNRWA, some 309 families, or about 1,500 people, have fled Nahr al-Bared for the camps of Borj Barajneh, Shatila and Mar Elias, located in and around Beirut. Sixty-one families have fled the north for the eastern Bekaa valley, staying with host families in villages or in the Wavel camp, while in the south 90 displaced families are being hosted by relatives in Rashadiyeh and Al-Buss camps in and around Tyre. A further 120 families have found shelter in Sidon city or Ein al-Helwe camp. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has delivered food and hygiene kits to scores of displaced Palestinian families in and around various refugee camps across the south and east of Lebanon over the past few days. On 31 May it distributed a further 20,000 litres of water and 800 hygiene kits into Nahr al-Bared camp, through its partners in the Palestinian Popular Committee. Sultan Abul Aynan, overall commander in Lebanon of the secular and dominant Palestinian faction Fatah, told IRIN that all of Lebanon's 12 refugee camps - home to just over half the country's 400,000 Palestinians - remained on a high security alert, but played down the prospects of further security breakdowns. Under a 1969 Arab agreement, the Lebanese army may surround but does not enter any of the camps, leaving security inside to the Palestinians. "The situation in the camps is under control and the Lebanese army is allowing us to get our necessary supplies," Abul Aynan said. UNRWA is now taking the lead on delivering aid to the estimated 20,000 people displaced to Beddawi camp, 10km from Nahr al-Bared, and to those who fled further south. Water and electricity services at Beddawi camp, which is just two kilometres square and whose original population numbered about 16,000, are struggling under the strain of the huge influx. The agency's single clinic in Beddawi camp is now running 12 hours a day in an effort to meet the huge extra demands. UNRWA said it is looking into the possibility of erecting prefabricated temporary accommodation on the edge of the camp and installing mobile generators, portable showers, toilets and water tanks. Some Palestinians quoted in local media reports, however, rejected the proposal, fearing it could encourage the full-scale destruction of Nahr al-Bared camp and decrease their chances of returning home. "The needs in Beddawi are still very great," said Hoda al-Turk, spokeswoman for UNRWA in Lebanon. "The food situation is alright but we still face a lack of clothes and hygiene kits."

Suspect Blames British For Spy's Death Litvinenko Died Of Poisoning By Rare Radioactive Isotope POSTED: 5:49 am EDT May 31, 2007 Sign Up for Breaking News Alerts The Russian businessman whom Britain has named as a suspect in the killing of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko said Thursday that he has evidence of British special services' involvement in the poisoning death. "Even if (British special services) hadn't done it itself, it was done under its control or connivance," Andrei Lugovoi told a news conference. Asked if he had evidence for the allegation, he said "I have evidence" but did not elaborate. A British government security official, who demanded anonymity in exchange for discussing Lugovoi's claims because of the sensitivity of the case, said suggestions British intelligence had involvement in Litvinenko's death were spurious. Britain last week said it had enough evidence to charge Lugovoi, who also worked for the KGB and its main successor agency the FSB, in the November killing of Litvinenko. Litvinenko, who died of poisoning by the rare radioactive isotope polonium-210, had fled to Britain several years earlier after becoming a strong critic of the Kremlin and received British citizenship. Lugovoi and another Russian had met in London with Litvinenko on Nov. 1, the day Litvinenko said he became ill. Britain has requested Lugovoi's extradition, but Russia has refused, saying the constitution does not permit such extraditions. Lugovoi has repeatedly asserted he is not guilty in the matter. On Thursday, Lugovoi also claimed that Britain had tried to recruit him to provide intelligence. British special services "asked me to collect compromising information on President (Vladimir) Putin," Lugovoi said. Lugovoi said the attempted recruitment occurred during business trips to Britain in previous years. He did not give a precise date, but indicated the alleged approach occurred in late 2005 or early 2006. London's Foreign Office, responsible for the country's overseas secret intelligence service MI6, declined to comment on Lugovoi's claim. But another government official with knowledge of Lugovoi, who also demanded anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, said the allegations were untrue. . All rights reserved.

The Taliban claimed responsibility. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said other troops rushing to the scene were ambushed and had to call in air support to drive off their attackers. Graphic locates Kajaki, where NATO helicopter crashed (William Castello - AP) The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article Initial reports suggested the helicopter was hit with a rocket-propelled grenade, said the U.S. official, who insisted on speaking anonymously because the crash was still under investigation. NATO said there were no survivors. Along with the five Americans, two soldiers from and Canada who had been passengers were also killed, military officials said. A purported Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, claimed in a phone call to The Associated Press that militants shot the helicopter down in southern Helmand province, the world's largest opium poppy-growing region where combat has been heavy in recent months. Ahmadi did not offer any proof for his claim, but he specified the helicopter crashed in the Kajaki district hours before NATO reported that information. Kajaki is the site of a hydroelectric dam and the scene of recent fighting. NATO said the CH-47 Chinook was carrying a crew of five and two military passengers when it crashed. The cause was "being determined by military officials," it said. NATO said troops going to the crash site were ambushed by enemy fighters and the unit called in an airstrike "to eliminate the enemy threat." It did not say if the troops were from the U.S.-led coalition, NATO's force or the Afghan army. One civilian was injured by gunfire. The CH-47 Chinook, a heavy transport helicopter with two rotors, can carry around 40 soldiers plus a small crew. The fact it was flying at night suggested the aircraft might have been carrying troops on a nighttime air assault. Kajaki is the site of a large U.S.-funded hydroelectric dam now being repaired so it can provide electricity to the southern city of Kandahar. British troops, who make up the bulk of the forces in Helmand province, have been engaged in fierce fighting around the dam protecting it. The NATO force, which is responsible for a countrywide counterinsurgency campaign, has 37,000 soldiers, including about 14,000 Americans. There are 12,000 U.S. troops in the separate U.S.-led coalition, which trains the Afghan army and conducts Special Forces anti-terrorism operations. Helicopter crashes in Afghanistan have been relatively rare. A Chinook crashed in February in the southern province of Zabul, killing eight U.S. personnel. Officials ruled out enemy fire as the cause.

Baker III, 1985-88; chief executive officer of board, Fannie Mae, 1983-85 Zoellick says unity, healing are World Bank goals By Barbara Hagenbaugh, USA TODAY WASHINGTON &#151; President Bush's nominee to head the World Bank vowed Wednesday to heal wounds at the embattled anti-poverty group and said his years of international experience made him qualified to do the job. "This institution has been through a traumatic period," Robert Zoellick, wearing globe-shaped cufflinks, told reporters a few hours after Bush's announcement. Bush says Zoellick is devoted to World Bank mission Some advice for the World Bank's new boss "There is a lot of anxiety, frustration and anger that has been built up," Zoellick said. "We need to try to calm the waters, but also then try to get a sense from people together about how we can build some consensus about the direction of the institution." Zoellick's nomination follows the resignation of Paul Wolfowitz. Wolfowitz, one of the architects of the 2003 invasion of Iraq while at the Defense Department, is leaving the bank June 30 after a protracted dispute about his handling of a pay raise and promotion for his girlfriend, a bank employee. Before joining Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs last year, Zoellick was deputy secretary of State, where he oversaw relations with Sudan's Darfur region. He also was U.S. Trade Representative in the Bush administration. Zoellick, 53, is a "committed internationalist," Bush said Wednesday. "He wants to help struggling nations defeat poverty, to grow their economies and offer their people the hope of a better life." The nomination, which needs approval from the bank's board of executive directors, was welcomed by officials around the globe. "His leadership and extensive experience in dealing with international organizations, as well as his clear understanding of the complexities of development issues, make him an excellent choice for this post," Angel Gurr&#237;a, Secretary-General of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, said in a statement. Created in July 1944, the World Bank provides financial and technical aid to developing nations. Although the bank is owned by its member countries, the USA nominates the bank's president under an informal agreement. Officials from some countries have recently questioned the process for selecting the head of the World Bank. In a statement issued Saturday, South African Treasury Minister Trevor Manuel advocated "an open, transparent selection process with candidates not restricted by nationality." Zoellick said Manuel had offered him his support Wednesday, admiring his experience in Africa. White House spokesman Tony Fratto said large countries in the World Bank are not seeking change. "The major shareholders have indicated they're not looking to change the process," he said.

EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana on Thursday urged greater flexibility from Iran in the growing row over its nuclear programme, but Tehran remained defiant ahead of key talks in Madrid. Solana "is asking the Iranians to show flexibility during the meeting today," his spokeswoman Cristina Gallach said before Solana met here with Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani. Earlier, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had also called on Iran "to change tactics" from its persistent defiance of UN Security Council demands to suspend uranium enrichment work, which Washington charges is part of a covert nuclear weapons programme. "The international community is united on what Iran should do and that is to suspend; to demonstrate that it is in fact not seeking a nuclear weapon under cover of civil nuclear power," Rice said in Vienna. Rice repeated Washington's offer to join multiparty talks on trade, security and technological benefits for Iran if the Islamic state halted the enrichment work. Thursday's meeting in Madrid will be the second between Solana and Larijani in just over a month after a fruitless head-to-head in Turkey in late April. It is also their first encounter since the expiration of a 60-day time limit set by the United Nations for Iran to stop enriching uranium, a process which can be used both to make nuclear fuel and, in highly purified form, the fissile core of an atomic bomb "This is a very difficult issue, the questions are very sensitive but a maximum effort must be made so that formal negotiations can start. For that to happen Iran must respect the Security Council resolutions," said Gallach. Oil-rich Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons, saying it wants only to produce energy for a growing population whose fossil fuels will eventually run out. The meeting in Madrid has only a slim chance of achieving any breakthrough, with Tehran showing no sign of buckling under increasing international pressure. "There is no possible path for the suspension of the enrichment of uranium," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said Thursday. "Iran will use all legal and judicial means to realise its legitimate rights and will not halt its nuclear activities," Hosseini added. And Larijani, speaking before flying to Madrid on Wednesday, had said that suspending enrichment was "not a logical way" to resolve the nuclear issue. Foreign ministers from the Group of Eight most industrialised nations said Wednesday that they were prepared to back "appropriate measures" if Iran failed to change its stance. The US is leading calls by Western powers for existing sanctions on Iran to be tightened. The UN Security Council first imposed sanctions on Iran in December for rejecting its demands, and then modestly increased them in March. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council -- China, Britain, France, Russia and the United States -- are growing increasingly frustrated and are determined to see the punitive measures strengthened, an analyst said. "Iran would be deceiving itself to believe that they won't," said Mark Fitzpatrick, senior fellow for non-proliferation at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London think tank. "They will give Iran a chance to come to the bargaining table with something to offer, but if Iran does not budge, additional sanctions will surely be imposed."

The final report of the Ipperwash Inquiry into Mr. George's death was released at the Forest Memorial Community Centre, not far from where the incident occurred. Commissioner Sidney Linden rejected suggestions that Mr. Harris' interfered in the Ontario Provincial Police's handling of the occupation of Ipperwash Provincial Park in September 1995. However, Justice Linden does find that Mr. Harris made racist comments and pushed for a speedy resolution of the conflict. Email to a friend "These comments and the speed at which the premier wished to end the occupation created an atmosphere that unduly narrowed the scope of the government's response to the occupation," Justice Linden said this morning. Following the release of the report, Sam George, the protestor's brother, called upon Mr. Harris to apologize for his role in the incident. "We hold him partly responsible for what happened for acting too fast," Mr. George said. But Peter Downard, a lawyer representing Mr. Harris, said the report exonerated his client and he would not apologize. "He didn't do anything wrong," Mr. Downard said. The Ontario government, however, did apologize to the George family and vowed to begin a new era of consultation with native people over land claims and other issues. "We apologize for the events that led to the loss of life and we deeply regret the death of Dudley George," Aboriginal Affairs Minister David Ramsay told a press conference here. "This report and the implementation of its recommendations will serve as a testament to his memory." Justice Linden's four-volume report blames the federal government's inaction on land claims and shoddy police planning for Mr. George's death, along with the impatience of provincial politicians. The report states that while it was OPP officer Ken Deane who ultimately killed Mr. George during a confrontation between police and native protestors, the officer "should not have been in a position to shoot Mr. George in the first place." Justice Linden rebuffs allegations that Ontario politicians, including Premier Mike Harris, attempted to interfere in OPP operations. "The provincial government had the authority to establish policing policy, but not direct police operations. The Premier and his government did not cross this line," the report states. However, Justice Linden does accuse Mr. Harris of making racist remarks, which "did not contribute to resolving Ipperwash peacefully." The report states Mr. Harris "could have urged patience, rather than speed" and criticizes the provincial government for not appointing a mediator at the outset of the conflict in September 1995.

Blair arrived in Johannesburg on a trip where he is also expected to ask SA to step up pressure on Zimbabwe&#x2019;s President Robert Mugabe, whose country is sliding towards economic collapse. SA is Blair&#x2019;s third stop on a trip aimed at building momentum for a rich nation summit that will focus on Africa and also to push for a world trade deal. Blair, who already visited Libya and Sierra Leone, is making one of his last overseas trips before he resigns on June 27 and hands over power to Finance Minister Gordon Brown. Blair is due to deliver a major policy speech on Africa and bid goodbye to anti-apartheid icon Mandela today, and hold talks with President Thabo Mbeki tomorrow. Zimbabwe is expected to be high on the agenda. The two countries have taken starkly different approaches to the southern African country&#x2019;s crisis, with Britain pushing for more public action and SA advocating a policy of "quiet diplomacy" in hopes of nudging Mugabe into making changes. The visit takes place on the eve of the Group of Eight Summit scheduled for Germany during which Chancellor Angela Merkel has vowed to press rich nations to fulfil aid pledges to Africa under a 2005 Blair initiative. In Sierra Leone yesterday, Blair called on Western countries to finance, train and equip African peacekeeping troops so they could intervene to end conflicts on the continent like the one in Sudan&#x2019;s Darfur.

Boy, are you getting younger every day" - Nelson Mandela Mandela greets &#39;youthful&#39; Blair 1.32, Thu May 31 2007 Prime Minister Tony Blair has met former South African president Nelson Mandela on the final leg of his farewell tour of Africa. Mr Mandela and his wife Graca Machel welcomed Mr Blair and his wife Cherie at the 88-year-old&#39;s foundation in Johannesburg. He embraced the Prime Minister saying: "Hello Tony how are you? Boy, are you getting younger every day." Mr Mandela added: "We are delighted that Prime Minister Blair has decided to honour us with his presence on his last trip to Africa. "He has been a very good friend to Africa and I know his commitment will continue in his retirement. We wish him the very best for his future. "Tony, I look forward to welcoming a young man like you to the club of retiring Presidents and Prime Ministers. I warn you however that some of us only become active after stepping down from office!" "We look forward to the contribution you will continue to make." Careful not to forget Chancellor Gordon Brown, Mr Mandela added: "The Prime Minister&#39;s successor, Gordon Brown, is also a dear friend to us. I look forward to Gordon&#39;s premiership of Britain, demonstrating the leadership and integrity that I know of him." A beaming Mr Blair responded: "As ever it&#39;s an honour and a privilege to stand next to President Mandela and thank him for everything he has done in his life, showing it is possible for things to change." Mr Blair, who will hold talks with South Africa&#39;s President Thabo Mbeki tomorrow, is due to attend next week&#39;s G8 summit in Germany, where South Africa will be taking part as part of the so-called "G8 Plus 5" group. The Prime Minister arrived in Johannesburg following an overnight flight from Sierra Leone after attacking the "cynicism" of critics who described his diplomatic mission to the continent as a "vanity expedition". He delivered a passionate defence of his interventionist foreign policy in a speech at the University of South Africa Business School in Midrand, near the capital Pretoria. And he called for greater urgency from the international community to stop the bloodshed in the Sudanese province of Darfur and restore normality to Zimbabwe. Mr Blair also insisted that intervening to assist the poor nations of Africa was not only morally the right thing to do but also in the self-interest of the rich world.

Blair, who flew in from Sierra Leone, was expected to meet with South African President Thabo Mbeki and the anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela during his two-day visit here. Blair and his wife Cherie were met at the airport by the British High Commissioner in South Africa, Paul Boateng. In an email interview last weekend with South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper, Blair said Africa would remain at the top of Britain's agenda after he steps down. He also promised a discussion of Mbeki's efforts to mediate a solution to a political crisis in Zimbabwe. "We'll discuss the desperate crisis in Zimbabwe, which is causing such misery for its people and is now having a damaging impact on neighbouring countries," he said. South Africa's deputy foreign minister Aziz Pahad said last week Mbeki would discuss with Blair ways in which the outgoing premier could continue supporting Africa after he left office.

Hariri was killed by a suicide truck bomb back in February of 2005. The road which he was killed on was closed indefinitely until today when it was re-opened for the very first time. The spot would now be a historic symbol according to Beirut Mayor Abdel-Monem al-Ariss. Syria was very fast to begin to criticize the tribunal as it affects international peace and military enforcement according to them. Syria has been implicated as to being involved in the killing in the past but has denied any involvement in it. Syrian President Bashar Assad stated that they would not cooperate with the tribunal if they break Syrian national sovereignty or infringe it in any way. Saad Hariri, the son of the late prime minister, stated that the decision is a big turning point to protect from further assassinations.

Thaksin ban reshapes Thailand politics Bangkok, May 31: Thailand faced an uncertain political future Thursday after a top court banned ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his party from contesting promised elections later this year. The ruling raises question marks over the credibility of the poll and the restoration of democracy promised by the military junta which deposed him in September last year. "I think it is going to be very rocky, very turbulent, unless they can win over Thai Rak Thai voters," said political analyst Thitinan Pongsudhirak at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. "They have not made any effort to do that. ... There is a big gap here, there is a neglected electorate," he added. Now living in self-imposed exile, Thaksin was said by his lawyer to be sad at the "unexpected and disappointing" verdict delivered late Wednesday by Thailand's Constitutional Tribunal. Chaturon Chaisang, the current leader of the former prime minister's Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party, on Thursday urged the movement's estimated 14 million loyalists to respect the ruling for the sake of national stability. But he also called the verdict an attempt to punish elected leaders. "It's as if my party members were executed for breaking a glass window while those who made the rules had burned down the house," the former deputy prime minister told Thai media. The court found Thaksin's party guilty of electoral fraud in April 2006 elections, which were later annulled amid a flurry of allegations of wrongdoing. The court, which was appointed by the junta, dissolved the party and banned Thaksin from politics for five years. "The Thai Rak Thai party did not respect the rule of law," one judge said, adding that it "cannot exist as a political party." A group with links to Thaksin has vowed to hold a rally in central Bangkok later Thursday in protest at the decision. *Your friend's e-mail address: Bush sees South Korea model for Iraq 7 NATO soldiers killed in Afghan crash No breakthrough on resumption of six-party talks on North Korea Shimon Peres announces Israeli presidency bid Yahoo!

Bush, in a counter-offer to European leaders on climate change, proposed convening a new round of talks with the world&#39;s biggest economies to set targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. In a speech today in Washington, the president softened his past opposition to setting global goals to cut the pollution that is causing the Earth&#39;s atmosphere to warm without saying what targets should be adopted or how they should be met. ``My proposal is this: By the end of next year America and other nations will set a long-term global goal for reducing greenhouse gases,&#39;&#39; Bush said in an address that set out the U.S. agenda during next week&#39;s meeting of the Group of Eight industrial nations in Heiligendamm, Germany. The talks would ``establish a new framework&#39;&#39; for when the Kyoto Protocol on emissions expires in 2012. Bush is heading into the G-8 summit having rejected a proposal by host German Chancellor Angela Merkel to set a target of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), effectively cutting emissions to half of 1990 levels by 2050. The administration also opposes a cap-and-trade system, favored by Europeans, that would allow the buying and selling of credits to meet carbon dioxide targets. By proposing to convene talks on climate change, Bush is positioning the U.S. to begin negotiations on the next steps to take. The president&#39;s critics said the administration was still trailing behind allies, state officials and U.S. companies in addressing global warming. ``The White House is just trying to hide the fact that the president is completely isolated among the G-8 leaders by calling vaguely for some agreement next year, right before he leaves office,&#39;&#39; said Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust. The proposal addresses one of Bush&#39;s objections to the 1997 Kyoto agreement, which required industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2012, by including India and China. Bush pulled the U.S. out of the accord. ``To develop this goal, the United State will convene a series of meetings of nations that produce the most greenhouse gas emissions, including nations with rapidly growing economies like India and China,&#39;&#39; Bush said. ``In addition to his long- term global goal, each country would establish mid-term national targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs.&#39;&#39; The climate change initiative that Bush proposed, under his 18-month timeline, would likely be among the last international agreements of his two-term administration. He&#39;s scheduled to leave office in January 2009. Bush said the U.S.-led climate change talks would include industry leaders so that technological advances are part of the solution. ``We need to harness the power of technology to help nations meet their growing energy needs while protecting the environment and addressing the challenge of global climate change,&#39;&#39; Bush said. Bush&#39;s plan may help head off criticism from European leaders that the U.S. refuses to go along with a proposal to set specific targets to help mitigate global warming. Concerned that mandatory cuts would hurt the economy, Bush had maintained support for new technologies and investment in alternative fuels such as ethanol to help curb harmful emissions. In his speech Bush outlined his broader agenda for the G-8 meeting and emphasized his initiatives on AIDS prevention and treatment in poor nations, fighting malaria and the need to finish work on a global trade accord that will open markets for developing nations as well as the world&#39;s richest. ``Trade will improve lives a lot faster than government aid can,&#39;&#39; Bush said. ``The United States will take the lead in making sure those markets are open.&#39;&#39; At the G-8 meeting, Bush said he would argue that lowering trade barriers also would help address energy and environmental challenges. ``If you are truly committed to helping the environment, nations need to get rid of their tariffs, need to get rid of those barriers that prevent new technologies from coming into their countries,&#39;&#39; he said. Bush said U.S. aid to developing nations has more than doubled during his presidency, from more than $10 billion in 2001 to $23 billion in 2006. He said it was the largest increase since the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II. Earlier this week, Bush imposed U.S. economic sanctions against Sudan in a bid to curb the violence in Darfur and called on the United Nations to step up financial pressure on Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir. Yesterday, Bush asked Congress to approve $30 billion during the next five years to mount a more aggressive campaign against the spread of AIDS worldwide, particularly in sub- Saharan Africa. The request would double the current U.S. program of $15 billion, which expires in 2008, and extend it to 2013, five years after Bush leaves office. The G-8 countries are the U.S., Japan, Germany, the U.K., France, Italy, Canada and Russia. The U.S. economy accounts for about 45 percent of the group&#39;s $29.3 trillion in annual economic output.

In a press conference in Moscow this morning, Mr Lugovoi also claimed the security services tried to recruit him to inform on Russian president Vladimir Putin. The Foreign Office has dismissed the allegations, and one of the exiles accused by Mr Lugovoi, Boris Berezovsky, told Channel 4 News that today&#039;s events proved the Kremlin was behind his friend&#039;s murder. Andrei Lugovoi, suspected of causing Litvinenko&#039;s death last November, held forth for an hour and a half - live on Russian state television. He declared he wanted to reveal the hidden truth behind the murder. He said Alexander Litvinenko was a British agent who tried to recruit him into MI6. "Litvinenko gave me a book. He said that we&#039;re like spies in the films now and have to use a code," he said. Lugovoi went on to claim that Litvinenko had fallen out with his MI6 handlers. He had ceased to be an asset and was killed. &#039;Litvinenko gave me a book. He said that we&#039;re like spies in the films now and have to use a code.&#039; But Lugovoi has provided no evidence for this claim. The Foreign Office responded: "This is a criminal matter, not an issue about intelligence." The Foreign Office is still awaiting a formal response to its request for Lugovoi&#039;s extradition so that he may face trial in the UK.

A-P correspondent Mike Gracia reports Wednesday's apparent suicide at Guantanamo Bay is raising new criticism of the prison. SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico &mdash; A Saudi Arabian detainee who apparently committed suicide at Guantanamo Bay had been held at the prison camp reserved for the least compliant and most "high-value" inmates, a U.S. military spokesman said Thursday. The Saudi government identified the man who died Wednesday as Abdul Rahman Maadha al-Amry. A spokesman for the kingdom's Interior Ministry, Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, said it was too early to judge how al-Amry died. The U.S. military has not confirmed the detainee's identity or explained how it arrived at the conclusion that he probably committed suicide. "The actual cause of death is under investigation," Southern Command spokesman Jose Ruiz said by telephone from Miami on Thursday. Ruiz said the man was held at the maximum-security Camp 5. Guards at the U.S. Naval Base in southeast Cuba found the detainee unresponsive and not breathing in his cell Wednesday afternoon, the Southern Command announced Wednesday. It would be the fourth suicide at Guantanamo since the prison camp opened in January 2002. On June 10, 2006, two Saudi detainees and one Yemeni hanged themselves with sheets. Prisoners in Camp 5, which is similar to the highest-security U.S. prisons, are kept in individual, solid-wall cells and allowed outside for only two hours a day of recreation in an enclosed area. Wells Dixon, a defense attorney who met with detainees at Camp 5 last month, said many showed signs of desperation. "I can assure you that it is hell on earth," Dixon said. "You can see the despair on the faces of detainees. It's transparent." Other critics said detainees are frustrated at being held indefinitely without charges. "You have five and a half years of desperation there with no legal way out," said Michael Ratner, president of the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents hundreds of Guantanamo detainees. "Sadly, it leads to people being so desperate they take their own lives." Lawyer Julia Tarver Mason, whose firm represents eight Saudi detainees at Guantanamo, said the government so far has declined to tell her if the man who died was among her clients. There are about 80 detainees from Saudi Arabia held at Guantanamo. "They are in the care of the United States government and that should mean that deaths should not occur," Mason said. The death came as Guantanamo prepares to hold pretrial hearings for two detainees in military tribunals. One of the detainees, Canadian Omar Khadr, fired his American attorneys on Wednesday, leaving him without defense counsel, his former U.S. military attorney told The Associated Press. Khadr is still to be arraigned Monday. He and Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni who also faces a hearing Monday, are among only three of the roughly 380 Guantanamo prisoners to be charged with a crime. The third, David Hicks, was convicted of aiding al-Qaida and returned to his native Australia. Khadr was 15 when he was captured in Afghanistan during a firefight in which he allegedly killed a U.S. Army special forces soldier with a grenade. "He doesn't trust American lawyers, and I don't particularly blame him," said U.S. Marine Lt. Col. Colby Vokey, who was taken off the case Wednesday. "The United States is responsible for his interrogation and his treatment under a process that is patently unfair." Many of the "enemy combatants" at the isolated prison camp have been held for more than five years. In most cases, the military accuses them of having links to al-Qaida or the Taliban. The former commander of the detention facilities, Navy Rear Adm. Harry Harris, described earlier suicides as acts of "asymmetric warfare" &mdash; an effort to increase condemnation of the prison. A cultural adviser was helping the military handle the remains. "The remains of the deceased detainee are being treated with the utmost respect," the military said. Associated Press writers Andrew O.

Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center released results of a study, showing that most people along the eastern and southern coasts of the United States haven't planned for hurricanes and don't feel vulnerable to the storms. The poll was commissioned by the organizers of the 2007 National Hurricane Survival Initiative, which includes the National Hurricane Center, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Emergency Management Association, the Salvation Army and others. The May 10-15 telephone poll of 1,100 people has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Residents of coastal states from Texas to Maine were included in the survey. A Pew Study commissioned earlier this month by North Carolina Gov. Mike Easley's office showed similar results among residents in the Tar Heel state, most of whom said they did not have a hurricane emergency kit prepared and did not feel especially threatened by hurricanes. Colorado State tropical weather experts Philip Klotzbach and William Gray issued their annual May 31 update to their hurricane forecast, and it had no changes from the most recent forecast, released April 3. Klotzbach and Gray, whose forecasts have been quite accurate in most recent years -- with last year being a notable exception -- say they still expect 17 named storms, almost twice the average number; nine hurricanes (the average is 5.9); and five hurricanes of Category 3 or stronger (2.3 is the average). Their estimates are close to those issued in recent weeks by the National Hurricane Center and a team of scientists from North Carolina State University. Experts agree that two factors present last year -- El Nino conditions in the Pacific Ocean, and a large number of African desert sandstorms -- are not present this year. Klotzbach and Gray also maintained their forecast of a 50 percent chance that a Category 3-or-stronger hurricane will make landfall this season on the East Coast, somewhere from Florida northward. On average, such a hurricane makes landfall on the East Coast about 31 percent of the years. In the survey, 53 percent of those surveyed in 18 Atlantic and Gulf Coast states say they don't feel that they are vulnerable to a hurricane, or to related tornadoes and flooding, according to the Mason-Dixon poll. Eighty-eight percent said they had not taken any steps to fortify their homes, and 45 percent still believed the old tale -- now discounted by experts -- that masking tape helps keeps windows from shattering during hurricanes. But only a small amount of people, 16 percent, said they would defy orders to evacuate and ride out a hurricane in their homes. But 61 percent of poll respondents had no hurricane survival kit. Of those who did, 82 percent packed a fire hazard -- candles or kerosene lamps. Missing from most of those kits were axes, which emergency officials recommended after many residents were trapped in their attics after Katrina. Despite the predictions for a busy season, public safety officials worry that an uneventful 2006 lulled residents into complacency; there were only 10 named storms, and the two that hit the U.S. were weak. The 2005 season set a record with 28 named storms, 15 of them hurricanes; four of those hurricanes hit the U.S. coast, including the devastating Katrina. In 2004, there were 15 named storms, four of them hurricanes that struck Florida.

Lebanon vows to protect refugees as fighting continues Refugees plead to be saved as Lebanese troops besiege camp US warning to Syria as Beirut asks for more arms 'We have no rights and no future' The standoff between the Lebanese army and Islamic militants has focused attention on the 400,000 Palestinian refugees in the country Clancy Chassay in Shatila refugee camp Duncan Campbell in Beirut Tuesday May 29, 2007 Palestinian refugee children, who fled the besieged camp of Nahr al-Bared in northern Lebanon, wait as their families collect aid donated by the UNRWA. Photograph: Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images In Lebanon's dusty, overcrowded Palestinian refugee camps people live in abject poverty, with many families surviving on food rations and handouts from the UN, in what was once temporary housing. In the teeming streets of Shatilla camp, the scene of a notorious civil war massacre, malnourished children play in little more than rags between crumbling bullet riddled buildings and amidst open sewage. "We have no rights and no future. We have a lot of problems; We can't work freely, we cannot own a house, we cannot move around. We are treated as if we are not human," said 20-year-old Samar, from Shatilla. The standoff between the Lebanese army and the militant Fatah al-Islam group has focused attention on the position of the 400,000 Palestinians in the country. Whatever happens in the Nahr al-Bared camp, Palestinian leaders hope that the attention attracted by the crisis will lead to a recognition of the grim and hopeless life that many of them have lived for more than half a century. "There is never any electricity, last year we went nearly six months without electricity, we had to use candles at night and those who could afford to bought electricity from people with generators," said Samar. She described how every winter the rain floods the camps and open sewage is washed into people's houses. "It's the worst in winter, when the floods come. Sometimes there is a metre of water in the street, you need a car just to cross." Palestinian refugees first arrived in 1948, mainly in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa valley, when they were greeted sympathetically by a population that thought their stay would be temporary. Since then generations have grown up with little more than a symbolic hope that they would return to a Palestinian homeland. A fresh wave arrived in the wake of the 1967 war after being deported from the occupied territories. Now, according to the UN relief and works agency (UNRWA) there are around 212,000 refugees in the camps and a further 188,000 outside. Some Palestinians claim that the figure may be lower, while some Lebanese authorities place it higher. Initially, they lived in tents that were slowly replaced with primitive breeze block structures with zinc roofs. Now conditions in many of the "camps" have deteriorated while their populations have multiplied. "The borders of the camp are fixed and it is illegal for us to build on the edge of the camp," explains 30-year-old Rabieh from Ain al Hilweh, Lebanon's largest camp. "The areas were very small to begin with but as the population has increased over time, people have been forced to live closer and closer together." Young men in the camps describe how they are harassed and beaten by the Lebanese security services. "The internal security forces are always aggressive if they know you are Palestinian," said Rabieh. "Sometimes guys are dragged off and beaten just because they have a certain family name." "They live under permanent pressure and there is despair," said Sybille Bikar, who works on the refugee issue in Lebanon for the European commission. "They feel they live in a very hostile world." The refugees do not enjoy citizenship and are restricted in the work they can do and where they can live, as they are not entitled to buy property. A government ordinance stretching back to 1982 prohibits them from work in many of the main professions and, as a result, unemployment is high. Many of the women working in service professions and the men in agriculture, while others have left Lebanon in despair to find work outside the region. "In terms of living conditions, Lebanon is the worst place for Palestinians outside Gaza and the West Bank," said a western diplomat. "They are better off in Syria." The Lebanese authorities are sensitive to allegations that they treat the Palestinians poorly. They argue that if they granted them citizenship, it would create an imbalance in the country's fragile demography, as they would constitute around 10% of the population and, since they are mainly Sunnis, create further problems in an already delicate religious equation. Some members of the government cling to the belief that, even after nearly three decades, the Palestinians will return south of the border and, if they were to integrate them, they would be finally accepting defeat. "If it were up to me, I would give them the right to work tomorrow," said Saad Hariri, of the Future Tide party and the son of the assassinated former leader, Rafik Hariri. "But if the Palestinians stay in Lebanon it will change the whole situation demographically." He said that he believed that they would eventually return. Palestinian spokesmen express frustration. Souheil el-Natour of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine said: "Even if we had a state in Gaza where would they go? One day or another we will have to reunite Israel and Palestine in one democratic state." Such poor conditions and so few opportunities make the camps a fertile breeding ground for militant groups who argue that patience and acceptance have achieved nothing. However, both Palestinian and Lebanese authorities are swift to distance Fatah al-Islam from the Palestinians.

The former U.S. trade representative will take over a 61- year-old agency that has expanded its mandate beyond building roads and clinics to include goals such as promoting ecological tourism and funding theater groups. Zoellick is more likely to concentrate on objectives that bring tangible results. ``The bank has to focus its mission on poverty reduction,&#39;&#39; said John Taylor, undersecretary of Treasury for international affairs from 2001 to 2005 and now a professor of economics at Stanford University in Stanford, California. ``Bob&#39;s management experience will enable him to implement those measurable-results reforms very well.&#39;&#39; Zoellick, 53, who negotiated seven international trade agreements in President George W. Bush&#39;s first term, is also apt to emphasize the economic benefits of giving developing countries unfettered access to overseas markets. ``He deeply believes in free trade,&#39;&#39; said Kenneth Rogoff, a professor at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. Before he can alter the bank&#39;s mission, Zoellick will have to win the trust of 13,000 staffers demoralized by two years of conflicts with departing President Paul Wolfowitz, who resigned this month over his role in giving his companion a pay increase. Bank employees said the controversy had damaged the credibility of an institution that preaches good government. Managers and board members clashed with the former U.S. deputy defense secretary over his appointments of recruits from the Bush administration, the bank&#39;s role in Iraq and his anti- corruption agenda. ``Having to clean up the Wolfowitz mess is going to detract from any effort at reform for at least a year or two,&#39;&#39; said Desmond Lachman, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a former official at the International Monetary Fund. Zoellick, nominated by Bush yesterday, told reporters in Washington he will consult member countries about ``the role of the bank.&#39;&#39; He said he had spoken to former presidents James Wolfensohn and Robert McNamara. ``One of the biggest challenges, if not the biggest challenge, will be the leadership and management issues that the bank faces today,&#39;&#39; he said. ``This institution has been through a traumatic period.&#39;&#39; Wolfowitz yesterday told Charlie Rose that he acted in good faith in dealing with his companion. ``I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a bad manager,&#39;&#39; Wolfowitz said, adding that because of the controversy, ``we&#39;d gotten to the point where it was not possible to be effective.&#39;&#39; Zoellick&#39;s nomination is subject to approval by the bank&#39;s board, which has said it would make a decision by June 30, when Wolfowitz leaves. The U.S. nominee has always won approval under an arrangement that reserves leadership of the IMF for a European. Zoellick became deputy secretary of state at the start of Bush&#39;s second term and left government in June of last year to become a vice chairman at New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc. He&#39;s on a long list of Goldman executives to join or rejoin the top ranks of government. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is a former Goldman chairman, and his former co-CEO Jon Corzine was elected senator from New Jersey and then governor. Joshua Bolton, Bush&#39;s chief of staff, was an executive director at Goldman in the 1990s. As trade representative in Bush&#39;s first term, Zoellick managed commercial relations with China and started the so- called Doha round of global talks. At the State Department, he traveled to Sudan to broker a peace agreement between the government and a rebel group. ``Zoellick is as good as it gets based on his record of promoting trade and combining policy vision with actual implementation of policies,&#39;&#39; said Ian Vasquez, director of the Project on Global Economic Liberty at the Washington-based Cato Institute. His diplomatic experience may help him continue Wolfowitz&#39;s fight against corruption. Wolfowitz ruffled feathers at the bank by suspending aid to countries including Kenya and Bangladesh without the board&#39;s approval. ``What Wolfowitz did was rub people&#39;s noses in it,&#39;&#39; said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ``He kind of marched up that mountain and now Zoellick has an easier task of keeping it going.&#39;&#39; Zoellick will also face criticism that the bank shouldn&#39;t lend to middle-income nations such as India and China, which can raise money in capital markets. Lending to such countries accounted for more than half of the $23 billion in World Bank aid last year. Zoellick yesterday ticked off a range of ills afflicting poor nations, including discrimination against women, corruption and environmental degradation. He didn&#39;t specify which ones the bank should tackle. ``Zoellick&#39;s really got a huge challenge ahead of him,&#39;&#39; said William Easterly, a former World Bank economist and a co- director of New York University&#39;s Development Research Institute. ``What the bank needs to do is find a few things it&#39;s good at doing and specialize in them.&#39;&#39; To contact the reporters on this story: William McQuillen in Washington at ; Matthew Benjamin in Washington at Last Updated: May 31, 2007 00:06 EDT Related Media on Demand Wolfowitz Says He Didn&#39;t Want to Set Companion&#39;s Pay Wachovia to Buy A.G.

They had not learned the lessons of Iraq, added Dr ElBaradei. He made his comments in an interview for a BBC Radio 4 documentary to be broadcast at 2000BST on Friday. This is not the first time that Dr ElBaradei has spoken out against the possibility of using force against Iran, but it is perhaps his strongest warning to date. Tehran is still refusing to bow to demands from the UN Security Council to halt its uranium enrichment programme, which the United States fears would give it access to material for a bomb. You do not want to give additional argument to new crazies who say 'let's go and bomb Iran' Dr ElBaradei said a nuclear-armed Iran would be terrible but the jury was still out as to whether the country even wanted nuclear weapons. But he said you could not "bomb knowledge", and he was scathing towards those who still favoured air strikes after the experience of intervention in Iraq. "I wake every morning and see 100 Iraqis innocent civilians are dying," he said. "I have no brief other than to make sure we don't go into another war or that we go crazy into killing each other. You do not want to give additional argument to new crazies who say 'let's go and bomb Iran.'" Asked who the "new crazies" were he replied: "Those who have extreme views and say the only solution is to impose your will by force." Dr ElBaradei said he was not referring to President George Bush but his remarks are likely to be interpreted as a swipe at those neo-conservatives in the US who still favour military action. In the light of Iran's secretive dealings with black market nuclear suppliers he said it owed his agency a confession over its once clandestine activities. In his latest report, last week, he said Iran continued to enrich uranium and information on its activities was now "deteriorating." Dr ElBaradei angered the US, UK, France and Germany backing the idea that Iran should be allowed limited uranium enrichment under strict supervision. His comments last week sparked immediate complaints from the countries. Inside the IAEA - A year with the nuclear detectives will be broadcast BBC Radio 4, 2000 BST 31 May and 7 June 2000 BST.

According to Iraqi and British officials working on the case, the kidnapping of a British IT expert and four private security guards bore all the hallmarks of the Mahdi Army, the militant group headed by Moqtada al-Sadr. The Shia religious leader returned to Iraq last week and there have been fears he would order a new wave of attacks against US and British targets. The US military announced yesterday that two more American soldiers had been killed in Iraq, confirming that May had become the deadliest month for American forces since 2004. The soldiers were killed late on Wednesday when a roadside bomb hit their foot patrol and brought US casualties for the month to 116 - the most since November 2004, when marines fought a fierce battle to retake the city of Fallujah. April was bloody for the US-led coalition, with 104 deaths. Taken together, the two past months have been the deadliest since the war began. Also yesterday, a suicide bomber hit a police recruiting centre in Fallujah, killing up to 25 people and wounding 50, police said. In another blow, a Sunni police chief praised by US forces for clearing his city of insurgents was arrested following an investigation into alleged murder, corruption and crimes against the Iraqi people. Colonel Hamid Ibrahim al-Jazaa, his brother and 14 bodyguards were taken into custody Tuesday in the city of Hit, 140km west of Baghdad, according to a statement by the public affairs office of Multinational Corps-Iraq. The statement gave no details of the allegations. As the hunt for the five Britons continued, it has been revealed British SAS troopers hunting for al-Qa'ida in Iraq are being diverted to lead the search for the men. The SAS and the Special Boat Service, the Royal Marine equivalent of the army's elite regiment, have squadrons in Baghdad, although their main task has been to work alongside American special forces. The SAS and SBS have been engaged in covert missions against al-Qa'ida for four years, giving them experience of operating in the most hostile and complex environment. Military sources said the search would need to be done with the greatest sensitivity. The "kinetic option" used against al-Qa'ida targets - tracking and eliminating - was not going to be the best solution. US commanders have backed away from taking on Mahdi Army gunmen because of the Iraqi Government's desire to keep al-Sadr, the Islamic cleric who controls the militia force, in the political process. If his men have taken the Britons, the focus will be on negotiating the safe release of the hostages, not going in with guns blazing. The Britons - a consultant and his four armed bodyguards - were snatched late on Tuesday by a large group of gunmen in Iraqi police uniforms. In an interview with BBC radio, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari noted the raid had taken place near Sadr City, an al-Sadr stronghold. He said it was too soon to blame a specific group, but said the nature of the kidnapping clearly pointed to the involvement of one of the Shia militant groups. Meanwhile, an Iraqi court yesterday sentenced a former minister in absentia to seven years in prison for spiriting more than $US1 billion ($1.25 billion) out of the country during his brief tenure. Hazem al-Shaalan was accused along with scores of other officials of embezzling money earmarked for weapons. He denied the charges, which were first raised in 2005.

A hurricane research team has renewed its forecast for an "above average" 2007 Atlantic storm season. REUTERS/Carlos Barria MIAMI (Reuters) - The Colorado State University hurricane research team renewed its forecast for an "above average" 2007 Atlantic storm season on Thursday and predicted 17 tropical storms, with nine growing to hurricane strength. Of those, five would grow into major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher with winds over 110 mph (177 kph), the team founded by forecast pioneer William Gray said in its revised forecast. The updated forecast issued on Thursday was unchanged from the team's April 3 forecast for the six-month storm season that starts on Friday. ADVERTISEMENT (article continues below) The researchers said there was a 74 percent chance that at least one major hurricane would hit the U.S. coastline in 2007, with a 50 percent chance that would happen on the U.S. Atlantic Coast and a 49 percent chance on the Gulf of Mexico coast. An average season brings 11 tropical storms, with six reaching hurricane wind speed of 74 mph (119 kph) and two growing into major hurricanes. Other private and government weather researchers have also predicted a more active season than average. But so far none have forecast anything like a repeat of record-breaking 2005, when 28 tropical storms spawned 15 hurricanes, including Katrina which flooded New Orleans and parts of the Gulf coast.

The meeting, which is expected to get underway in Madrid at 5.00 pm (1500 GMT), will be their second in just over a month after a fruitless head-to-head in Turkey in late April. The dispute over Iran's refusal to heed UN demands to suspend uranium enrichment work has intensified in recent days, with stepped up rhetoric on both sides of the debate. Foreign ministers from the Group of Eight most industrialized nations said Wednesday in a statement that they were prepared to back "appropriate measures" if Iran persisted in defying the United Nations. "If Iran continues to ignore demands of the Security Council, we will support further appropriate measures as agreed in Resolution 1747," they said in a statement following at a meeting in Potsdam, Germany. Security Council resolution 1747 set a 60-day deadline for Tehran to freeze all enrichment work, which expired last week. Western powers accuse oil-rich Iran of seeking nuclear weapons, a charge vehemently denied by Tehran, which says that it just wants to produce energy. They are now pressing for Iran to face further penalties for its continued defiance over uranium enrichment, the process that can be used both to make nuclear fuel and, in highly purified form, the fissile core of an atomic bomb. Iran insists that it has a right to enrichment for peaceful ends as a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The meeting in Madrid has only a slim chance of achieving any breakthrough, with Tehran showing no sign of buckling under growing international pressure. "There is no possible path for the suspension of the enrichment of uranium," Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said Thursday. "Iran will use all legal and judicial means to realize its legitimate rights and will not halt its nuclear activities," Hosseini added. And Larijani, speaking before flying to Madrid Wednesday, had said that suspending enrichment was "not a logical way" to resolve the nuclear issue. A diplomat in Vienna, headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said that the talks "won't reach any decision. It's just an exchange of ideas." The five permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, Britain, France, Russia, and the United States - are growing increasingly frustrated with Iran and are determined to impose more sanctions if it shows no willingness to suspend its program at the talks, an analyst said. "Iran would be deceiving itself to believe that they won't," said Mark Fitzpatrick, senior fellow for non-proliferation at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London think tank. "They will give Iran a chance to come to the bargaining table with something to offer, but if Iran does not budge, additional sanctions will surely be imposed." Last week US President George W. Bush said that he would work with European allies, Russia, and China to toughen existing penalties. The United Nations Security Council first imposed sanctions on Iran in December for rejecting its demands, and then modestly increased them in March. The talks held last month between the EU foreign policy chief and Larijani were "positive in form but not fruitful in substance," Solana's spokeswoman Cristina Gallach said in Brussels Wednesday. Larijani has said "positive points were discussed in Ankara," describing them as "buds which need to grow on an international level to resolve the issue."

As journalists looked on, a judge who mediated in the dispute escorted the four men taken May 9 to the governor's offices in southern Rivers State where he handed the liberated hostages over to authorities. U.S. embassy officials weren't immediately available for comment. Some 200 foreign workers have been kidnapped since armed militants stepped up their attacks against oil companies and the government in late 2005. Most have been quickly released for ransom. Growing lawlessness, including armed attacks, in the oil-rich Niger Delta have cut about a quarter of exports from Africa's leading oil producer. The impoverished region has nearly all of Nigeria's oil, and most inhabitants want an increased share of revenue. In his inaugural speech Tuesday, President Umaru Yar'Adua appeal for an immediate end to violence in the region of swamps, creeks and mangrove forests. The largest militant group said it would consider the overture. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Bank nominee says discord must end Institution shaken over Wolfowitz President Bush chose Robert Zoellick, 53, yesterday to run the World Bank, which seeks to fight poverty. If approved by the 24-member board, Zoellick will bring years of experience in foreign and economic policy. (Roger L. Wollenberg/Pool) By Jeannine Aversa, Associated Press | WASHINGTON -- Robert Zoellick has dealt with the Cold War, the killing in Darfur, China's rise as an economic colossus. His next challenge: to restore confidence at the badly shaken World Bank. "We need to put yesterday's discord behind us and to focus on the future together," Zoellick declared after President Bush chose him yesterday to run the poverty-fighting institution and heal wounds left behind by Paul Wolfowitz, outgoing president. "I believe that the World Bank's best days are still to come," said Zoellick, now an executive at Wall Street giant If approved by the World Bank's 24-member board, Zoellick, 53, will also bring to the institution years of experience in the foreign and economic policy arenas under three Republican presidents, starting with Ronald Reagan. Pascal Lamy, director general of the World Trade Organization, praised his "ability as a strategist, as one who can broker compromise and as one who has profound interests in the concerns of developing countries." As trade chief for the European Union, Lamy went head-to-head with Zoellick when he was US trade representative over steel, aid to plane makers Co. and Airbus, and hormone-treated beef. "I think we often disagreed, but that was part of our business," said Luiz Felipe de Seixas Corr&#xEA;a, the Brazilian ambassador who led his country's successful WTO challenge of the US cotton subsidy program. "I can say he's superbly qualified for the World Bank job." The selection of Zoellick appeared far less controversial than when Bush chose Wolfowitz, then the number two official at the Pentagon. His role in the Iraq war upset Europeans and others. Wolfowitz had a stormy two-year tenure at the bank, culminating in his resignation -- effective June 30. He was essentially forced to leave after a special bank panel found he broke bank rules when he arranged a hefty compensation package in 2005 for his girlfriend, Shaha Riza, a bank employee. The controversy caused a staff revolt and strained US relations with Europeans. Zoellick will need to regain trust, rebuild credibility, and mend frayed relations inside the institution as well as with its member countries around the world. He will also need to persuade countries to contribute nearly $30 billion over the next few years to fund a centerpiece bank program that provides interest-free loans to the world's poorest countries. "We need to approach this task with humility and creative minds," Zoellick said. He said he planned to meet soon with the bank's contributors, borrowers, and others, to listen to their perspectives on how the institution can best fulfill its purpose. In tapping Zoellick, Bush picked a veteran of politics both inside the Beltway and on the international stage. He is known for pulling facts and figures off the top of his head. He also has a reputation for being a demanding boss. "Bob Zoellick brings a wealth of experience and energy to this task," Bush said. "Over the past three decades, he's held important posts in government, business, and higher education. "In short, it would probably be easier to list all the jobs Bob hasn't had," the president joked. Zoellick announced last June that he was leaving his post as deputy secretary of state to go to Goldman Sachs and work to develop investment markets around the world. As the State Department's number two diplomat, Zoellick brokered peace talks in Darfur and dealt with many thorny issues involving the complex relationship between the United States and China. "My experience working with him on the subject of Darfur tells me that I know that he cares about that issue, which is very important to the American people," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat . "He's sensitive to the need to alleviate poverty there, to resolve conflict in a peaceful way. . . . I have been impressed by what he has done." When he was Bush's top trade envoy, Zoellick played a key role in negotiations to bring China into the World Trade Organization. He forged free trade deals between the United States and other countries, including Singapore, Chile, Australia, and Morocco. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Click me to Brother says Dudley George's brother stood up for what he believed in Two aboriginal protesters man a barricade near the entrance to Ipperwash Provincial Park, near Ipperwash Beach, Ont., on Sept. 7, 1995. (CPimages '95) Published: Thursday, May 31, 2007 FOREST, Ont. (CP) - The brother of Dudley George says the aboriginal protester's legacy is that he stood up for what he believed in. Sam George says his brother was vindicated by the findings of an inquiry into his death during a police raid at Ipperwash provincial police 12 years ago. Commissioner Sydney Linden found that Dudley George was not armed the night he occupied the provincial park and was shot dead by police. George says he holds Mike Harris partially responsible for what happened, and that he hopes the former premier will apologize to his family. The report found government impatience and unwillingness to settle aboriginal land claims all contributed to George's death. A lawyer for Harris says the report also found that Harris did not interfer in police operations in the land dispute which remains unsettled.

Gray, based at Colorado State University, described it as a very active season. He said there was a 74 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall somewhere on the U.S. coast. There is a 50 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the East Coast, including the Florida Peninsula, according to the new forecast; the long-term average is 31 percent. The chance of a major hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast between the Florida Panhandle and Brownsville, Texas, is 49 percent; the long-term average is 30 percent. There is also an above-average chance of a major hurricane making landfall in the Caribbean, according to the forecast. Today's forecast was largely unchanged from Gray's last forecast, released in early April. The Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, averages 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes per year. SPAIN MAKES COURT CLAIM OVER SUNKEN COLONIAL-ERA TREASURE The Spanish government has filed claims in U.S. federal court over a shipwreck that a Florida firm found laden with colonial-era treasure, an attorney said today. If the vessel was Spanish or was removed from that country's waters, any treasure would belong to Spain, said James Goold, an attorney representing the government. "It's a very well established principle under Spanish, U.S. and international law that a government such as the kingdom of Spain has not abandoned its sunken ships or sunken property, and that a company like Odyssey Marine Exploration may not conduct recovery operations without authorization by the government," he said. "The kingdom of Spain has not authorized any such operations by Odyssey, and by these legal actions it will see the return of any Spanish property Odyssey has recovered," Goold said of the claims filed Wednesday. Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. co-founder Greg Stemm said this morning the company was working on a statement in response to Spain's claims. He has previously called Spain's legal threats "absurd" and said that Odyssey would notify all claimants once it conclusively determined the ship's identity. LISTENER HELPS SAVE N.C. DISC JOCKEY WHO COLLAPSED ON THE AIR A radio listener in Shelby, N.C., helped save a disc jockey who suffered an on-air seizure and pleaded for help before passing out in his studio. WOHS DJ Tim Biggerstaff, who has suffered from diabetes since childhood, has always been candid about his health. When he felt a seizure about to strike Monday, he called out to his listeners. Gerald Weathers heard the plea and raced to the nearby studio. Since Biggerstaff was the only person working on the holiday, officials contacted another WOHS radio employee to unlock the door. Biggerstaff was found unconscious inside. "It's quite frankly a bloody miracle that I am here at all," said Biggerstaff, 46. This isn't the first time a listener has saved the DJ's life. Three years ago, a listener donated a kidney to him when he needed a transplant. LATER TODAY ON MACON.COM - Georgia drivers can expect to pay a higher gasoline tax beginning Friday.

(OpenCube Inc. - http://www.opencube.com)**** Suit alleges Jeppesen assisted CIA ACLU says company helped agency fly terrorism suspects to secret jails Use your sleuthing skills to post an opinion on By Chris Walsh, Rocky Mountain News A lawsuit filed Wednesday alleges that Arapahoe County-based Jeppesen knowingly helped the Central Intelligence Agency fly terrorism suspects overseas to secret jails where the prisoners were tortured. The American Civil Liberties Union claims Jeppesen, a 73-year-old company that offers a host of flight-planning and navigation services, provided support to at least 15 aircraft that made 70 flights to clandestine locations since December 2001. During those flights, suspects allegedly were stripped, blindfolded, chained down - one even made to wear a diaper. The ACLU says the suspects were tortured and subjected to other forms "of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment" at overseas locations under the CIA's so-called extraordinary rendition program. Officials at Jeppesen, a subsidiary of Boeing Co., had no immediate comment. The company, though, stressed that it doesn't provide flights and knows little about its clients' intentions. "We have thousands of customers who do tens of thousands of flights a day that we'll support with information in some fashion," said company spokesman Mike Pound. "There are some things we have to know, such as what route the airplane is going to take. But it isn't necessary to know why somebody is making a trip, and it is not our practice to ask." The Jeppesen name is familiar to many locals: Denver International Airport's main terminal is named after Elrey Jeppesen, who founded the company and was inducted into the Colorado Business Hall of Fame. The company provides everything from flight charts and weather data to training and software. It employs 1,400 in Colorado and has offices worldwide. Jeppesen has been linked to the covert CIA flights before. In 2006, an article in claimed Jeppesen regularly arranges CIA "spook" flights to overseas locations. The magazine quoted a former worker who said a top-level executive admitted that the company participates in the flights. Since then, peace activists and others have protested outside the company's offices in San Jose, Calif., home of Jeppesen's International Trip and Flight Planning Office, which is said to have organized the flights. ACLU attorney Ben Wizner said Jeppesen could not have been ignorant of the purpose of CIA flights. "Either they knew or reasonably should have known that they were facilitating a torture program," he said. Companies "are not allowed to have their head in the sand and take money from the CIA to fly people, hooded and shackled, to foreign countries to be tortured." The lawsuit says Jeppesen participated in everything from providing aircraft crew with weather, route information and hotel accommodations to facilitating customs clearance and securing landing permits from foreign governments. Jeppesen's parent, Chicago-based Boeing, is not named in the lawsuit. Boeing spokesman Tim Neale said company officials typically don't comment on lawsuits and had not seen this one, nor would they confirm the allegations that Jeppesen provided services to the CIA. "Jeppesen has a confidentiality clause with all its customers," he said. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District, does not name the CIA as a defendant. The Bush administration has insisted it receives guarantees of no torture from countries receiving terror suspects. Ralph Latimer persuaded the Denver City Council to name Denver International Airport's terminal after aviation legend Elrey Borge Jeppesen, who moved to the city in 1941 and was here until his death in 1996. Capt. Jeppesen was the first person to exit the first plane to land at DIA on the airport's opening day- Feb. 28, 1995. or 303-954-2744. Rocky wire services contributed to this report.

US forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al-Qaida gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. Residents gather near a burnt vehicle after an air strike by US forces in Baghdad's Sadr City May 31, 2007. In a statement, the US military said they arrested two suspected insurgents during a raid on Thursday in Sadr City. [Reuters] At least 10 policemen were among the dead in the Fallujah attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. Fallujah, in restive Anbar province, is 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated his explosives vest at the third of four checkpoints as he stood among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only been opened on Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The US military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaida. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of Sunni insurgents and al-Qaida through the course of the Iraq war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents there called for US help. Members of al-Qaida, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final examinations, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. He spoke on condition of anonymity fearing retribution from al-Qaida. Clashes continued into Thursday afternoon, and the council official said the al-Qaida leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the US military. American forces, meanwhile, pressed on Thursday with the search for five kidnapped Britons, and a procession of mourners, some of them women wailing and beating their chests, marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a US helicopter strike before dawn. The US military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the alleged attack in the second day of a search for the Britons who were abducted from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad on Tuesday. A US military statement, however, said US and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" on Thursday in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. Associated Press Television news video tape from Sadr City showed the coffins of the victims atop a small bus with men and women walking behind, crying. A young boy could be seen sitting next to the coffins on the bus. A car near where the attack happened was punctured with big holes as if hit by an airstrike. A police officer in Sadr City, who refused to allow use of his name because he feared retribution, said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 a.m., killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home, a common practice in the extreme heat of Iraq through late spring and summer. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was injured. Also in Sadr City raids, which the US has been conducting with a select unit of Iraqi army forces, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi claimed his home was raided and ransacked by American forces at 3 a.m. Thursday. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. The US military also did not immediately comment on al-Suwaidi claim. Dozens of US Humvees and Bradley fighting vehicles had taken up positions around Sadr City at nightfall Wednesday. The Britons were snatched from a Finance Ministry facility in a mock police raid that Iraqi officials said was carried out by the Mahdi Army Shiite militia. A secret incident report about the abductions - written by Najwa Fatih-Allah, director general of the Finance Ministry's data processing center, where the Britons were seized - quotes Gen. David Petraeus, the US commander in Iraq, as saying the Mahdi Army "will be profoundly sorry" if it carried out the assault. Much of the Mahdi Army militia is said to be loyal to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who resurfaced last week after nearly four months in hiding, apparently in Iran, and demanded US troops leave Iraq. Al-Sadr's return appeared to be partly an effort to regain control over his militia, which had begun fragmenting. It was unclear whether the 33-year-old cleric would have been aware of or condoned the kidnapping of the five British citizens - four bodyguards and an employee of a management consulting firm. When al-Sadr went underground at the start of the US-led security crackdown on Baghdad 15 weeks ago, he ordered his militia off the streets to prevent conflict with American forces. Nevertheless, his return likely complicates US efforts to crack down on violence and broker political compromise in the country. another group. Fatih-Allah's report to Finance Minister Bayan Jabr revealed key new details about the attack. Portions of the report were read to The Associated Press on the telephone by a government official who did so on condition of anonymity because the document was not for public distribution. The report said four men in civilian clothing appeared at the center about 10:45 a.m. Tuesday - 15 minutes before the kidnapping. The account said the men claimed they were from the government anti-fraud commission and looked through each room in the center, then quickly left the building. At about 11 a.m. dozens of men in army and police uniforms, the report said, burst into the building, disarmed guards and went directly into the room where the five Britons were working. The five were seized and rushed out of the building to 19 waiting four-wheel-drive vehicles. The convoy then drove away to the east. The five kidnapped Britons included four bodyguards working for the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld and one employee of BearingPoint, a US-based management consulting firm. The US military late Wednesday reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed in a roadside bombing and one who died of a non-combat cause. The bombing victims died Wednesday, the third soldier on Tuesday. Their deaths raised to 119 the number of soldiers killed this month, the third-deadliest month of the war for US troops. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. The Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, has claimed responsibility.

Master Cpl. Darrell Jason Priede was the 56th Canadian service member killed since 2002 in Afghanistan, his death coming less than a week after another corporal lost his life to a roadside bomb. As a surface patrol headed in to the crash site, the troops themselves were ambushed by insurgents, according to NATO. Email to a friend Under continuing fire, the patrol eventually called for an air strike to "eliminate the enemy threat," said a news release from ISAF, NATO's Afghanistan mission. All five crew members of the Chinook heavy lift helicopter and two military passengers were killed in the incident, said the release. An Afghan civilian was injured in the shooting after the helicopter went down. Priede was a combat cameraman taking part in an operation around the Kajaki damn, the scene of fierce fighting recently between mainly British soldiers and the Taliban. The U.S.-funded dam is being repaired so it can supply electricity to Kandahar and the British have fought hard to protect it from insurgent attack. The corporal's job involved recording operations so there is an accurate record of what took place. "In working to bring peace to this troubled country, he has ended up paying the ultimate sacrifice," said Brig.-Gen. Tim Grant, head of Canada's Afghanistan task force. "There is no way to comfort those who grieve at this terrible time. However, we should all remember that Darrell was involved in a good thing, a good fight and we should be proud of what he has done." Qari Yousef Ahmadi, a self-described Taliban spokesman, said in an interview the insurgents had used "new weapons" against the aircraft and they had worked successfully. "We're very happy," said Ahmadi, whose claims could not be proven independently. ISAF said only that it was investigating the cause of the downing. Amanullah, a farmer in Khanano Kaly in Helmand province, who goes by only one name, said he saw the helicopter hit the ground and that Taliban had been shooting in the area. He could not tell, however, whether the craft was actually brought down by the insurgents. Amanullah, 40, described seeing the aircraft in flames on the ground near his home. Early last Friday, Cpl. Matthew McCully, 23, died after triggering an improvised explosive device reportedly planted by the Taliban. He was part of a unit that trains and mentors the Afghan national army and was accompanying ANA troops as they led an operation against the insurgency in Kandahar province's Zhari district.

Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said the situation remained "quite unclear", but insisted everything possible was being done to secure their release. It is not yet known who carried out the kidnap, but a senior aide of radical Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr said his group - the Mehdi Army - was not involved. The five were seized at the finance ministry in the Sadr City suburb. On Wednesday, US and Iraqi troops carried out raids and sealed off parts of the city close to where the kidnapping took place. The US military said a number of militants had been arrested but would not confirm whether the raids were linked to the missing Britons. There has been speculation that the group were abducted in retaliation for the killing of a Mehdi Army militia leader. The Foreign Office has said there is no firm indication as to who was responsible. Speaking at the G8 summit in Berlin, Mrs Beckett said families of the missing were being kept informed of any progress. 'Hired guns' in Iraq 'I worked in northern Iraq' Who are Mehdi Army? And she said everything possible was being done "to find out where they may be and why they're being held". Meanwhile, Iraq's national security adviser Muwaffak al-Rubaie pledged to bring the kidnappers to justice. "This group of kidnappers, they are terrorists, whether they are Shia extremists or Sunni extremists," he said. The five men - a computer expert and four bodyguards - were taken from the finance ministry building in Palestine Street. The kidnappers, dressed in police uniforms, walked past ministry guards and staged the capture without firing a shot, senior Iraqi officials said. A police source told the BBC dozens of police vehicles were used in the operation. The four kidnapped security guards were working for Canadian-owned security firm Gardaworld. The company is one of the biggest suppliers of private security in Iraq, and is mainly staffed by Britons. The kidnapped computer expert was employed by Bearingpoint, a US management consultancy which has worked on development projects in Iraq since 2003. Private contractors are known to be unpopular with Iraqis.

Sheddy Ozoene, spokesman for the state government, said the four were released and handed over to the state governor Emmanuel Uduaghan. According to Uduaghan, the released oil workers included Mike Russel, Larry Slake, Chris Gay and Kevin Saller. The state governor said the militants had demanded for ransom for their release but that because of government policy against hostage taking, "they were not given any ransom." The four were taken hostage by local militants on May 9 in Nigeria's oil-rich yet restive Niger Delta area. Since the beginning of this month, about 40 foreigners have been abducted in southeastern Nigeria. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer with a daily crude output of 2.6 million barrels. However, the repeated occurrence of kidnapping has frightened thousands of foreign oil workers away since last year, forcing the oil production to reduce by nearly 25 percent.

Lugovoy, the man charged by Britain with murdering former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko ,denied involvement on Thursday, saying British intelligence and a self-exiled Russian multi-millionaire were far more likely suspects. (Xinhua/Reuters Photo) BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhuanet) -- The former spy on Thursday accused of murdering former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko has claimed the British security services were involved. Andrei Lugovoy said he has evidence that MI6 took part in Litvinenko's poisoning with polonium-210. He also said MI6 tried to recruit him to collect information on President Putin and that both Litvinenko and exiled tycoon Boris Berezovsky were in its pay. Lugovoy told a news conference in Moscow: "Even if (British special services) hadn't done it itself, it was done under its control or connivance." Papers requesting Lugovoy's extradition were formally submitted to the Russian authorities earlier this week. The Crown Prosecution Service charged the Russian businessman with murder following an exhaustive investigation by detectives at Scotland Yard. But the Russians said they will not extradite Lugovoy as it would breach their constitution. Lugovoy worked for the KGB and its main successor agency the FSB. He is now a successful businessman training bodyguards. He and another Russian met in London with Litvinenko on Nov. 1, the day Litvinenko said he became ill. Police later found traces of the rare isotope polonium-210 at a number of locations including hotels, a restaurant and aeroplanes, used by Lugovoy.

By Gerard Aziakou - UNITED NATIONS The UN Security Council on Wednesday voted to set up an international court to try suspects in the murder of Lebanese ex-premier Rafiq Hariri, whose death sent shockwaves through the nation two years ago. The legally binding resolution, which was narrowly approved, sets June 10 as the date for a 2006 agreement between the United Nations and the Beirut government to establish the court enters into force. Ten of the Security Council's 15 members voted in favor of Resolution 1757, with veto-wielding members Russia and China as well as South Africa, Indonesia and Qatar -- three non-permanent members -- abstaining. The vote came at a time of high tensions in deeply divided Lebanon, exacerbated by a deadly standoff between the army and a militia and a spate of bomb attacks, with security high in and around the capital Beirut. There are fears the UN decision could further rattle the stability of the country, where the Western-backed government is facing calls for its ouster by the pro-Syrian opposition. And while Lebanon's press echoed the rifts over the court, Hariri's MP son Saad, the leader of the anti-Syrian parliamentary majority, urged unity. "Let's all join hands in defending the international tribunal... as an opportunity for all Lebanese to unite," he said. His father and 22 other people were killed in a massive truck bombing in Beirut in February 2005, widely blamed on Syria, which was then forced to end nearly 30 years of military and political domination in Lebanon. An initial UN inquiry implicated Damascus and its allies in Lebanon, where four pro-Syrian security chiefs were arrested. But Syria has vehemently denied any involvement. Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora said a trial would allow for "the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth" to be revealed, saying the court is "not directed against anyone and especially not sister Syria." The project has been at the heart of a long-running political dispute that has paralysed Siniora's government since the opposition pulled out six cabinet ministers in November. At the United Nations, the six co-sponsors -- the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Slovakia and Italy -- hailed the text while other nations expressed concern about interfering in an already unstable situation. The tribunal, which will be held in an as yet undetermined "neutral" location, is not likely to be up and running until several months after the treaty enters into force, diplomats said. British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett acknowledged that the "tribunal has been a politically sensitive issue" and applauded the Security Council for adopting the resolution in order to move forward. "The Security Council has demonstrated its support for the government of Lebanon and its commitment to the principle that there shall be no impunity for political assassinations, in Lebanon or elsewhere." Her comments were echoed by US Ambassador to the UN Zalmay Khalilzad, who hailed the "commitment to the principle that there shall be no impunity in Lebanon or elsewhere" and hoped the tribunal would "deter future political assassinations." However, Syria's UN envoy Bashar Jaafari opposed the move, and there were more dissenting voices from members which chose to abstain. "Those who were behind such a resolution would assume the consequences, but definitely this is something that goes against the interests of the Lebanese people and Lebanon as a whole," Jaafari said. Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin objected to the reference to Chapter Seven of the UN Charter, used in cases of threats to international peace and security. He also called the resolution "dubious from the standpoint of international law" as it bypasses the requirements of Lebanon's constitutional process. And in Berlin for talks with the quartet of main Middle East players, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that a sharp increase in US military aid earmarked for Lebanon could destabilize the country. Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz al-Nasser of Qatar, the lone Arab member of the council, expressed fear the ruling "would not bring stability in Lebanon" and involved "legal encroachment that may further complicate the situation." Western powers had put forward the resolution after UN chief Ban Ki-moon reported that rival Lebanese parties had failed to agree on ratifying the 2006 accord. "What is most important for the tribunal is to have people who are accused. Where are the accused?" Christian Maronite opposition leader Michel Aoun, himself a former prime minister, told French radio before the vote. And Damascus, through its state news agency SANA in a commentary issued before the vote, warned of possible repercussions on the ground in Lebanon. A jittery Lebanon clamped down on security for the night, as a blast apparently caused by a sound grenade shattered the calm but caused no casualties or damage. "New York has imposed the tribunal on Lebanon... who will impose harmony between the Lebanese?" said Lebanese pro-Syrian newspaper As-Safir.

Seven people died in the crash, five of them US crew. Two military passengers - one British, one Canadian - also died. Nato-led troops are fighting militants nearby. Dozens of Taleban were killed or injured, Afghan officials say. Elsewhere, at least 16 policemen died in a Taleban ambush in southern Zabul province, the interior ministry said. Fighting between Nato-led security forces and the Taleban has escalated in recent weeks - particularly in the south. Nato is still investigating the cause of Wednesday's crash, but says it looks as if Taleban claims to have shot the Chinook down may well be correct. RECENT AFGHAN AIR CRASHES - Eight US troops die in helicopter crash in Zabul province - 14 UK service personnel die in Nimrod crash in Kandahar province - Dutch F-16 fighter pilot dies in crash in south of country - 16 people of multiple nationalities die in helicopter crash in south-east - 10 US soldiers die in helicopter crash in Kunar province - Five die when US anti-drugs plane crashes in southern Afghanistan "It was a hostile area where the helicopter went down," said Major John Thomas, a spokesman for Nato's International Security Assistance Force (Isaf). "Initial indications are that enemy fire may have brought down the helicopter." The helicopter crashed at around 2100 (1630 GMT) in the Kajaki district of Helmand, Isaf said in a statement. A rescue patrol was ambushed by "enemy fighters" and forced to call for an air strike to access the crash site, Isaf said. Incidents of helicopters being shot down are relatively rare in the country, says the BBC's Alastair Leithead in Kabul. About 30,000 alliance troops and another 10,000 US-led ones have been battling to boost the authority of President Hamid Karzai. On Thursday, Isaf confirmed that fighting was going on against the Taleban in Sangin district, near Kajaki. A statement said air strikes had been carried out against Taleban positions. It did not say whether there had been any casualties. But the Afghan Defence Ministry said dozens of Taleban fighters had been killed or wounded. Local people have disputed the government account, saying some of those killed were civilians rather than Taleban. Sangin district police chief Ghulam Wali told the BBC the aim of the operation was to secure the road from the Shali area to Kajaki. In the ambush in Zabul, six policemen were injured as well as those killed, officials said. Interior Ministry spokesman Zmaray Bashary told the BBC that police had also inflicted heavy casualties on their attackers in a gun battle which had raged for 20 minutes. He said the ambush took place in Shahjoy district, a Taleban stronghold, as the police convoy travelled from Zabul to Ghazni.

Gaza: Israeli bombing won't bring peace any more than previous military crackdowns. American-Israeli help to bolster President Mahmoud Abbas' security forces won't stop Hamas from acquiring more rockets to hurl at Israel. The Saudi-sponsored unity government between Fatah and Hamas won't end their internecine warfare. "The problem is Gaza itself," writes Fawaz Turki, author of The Disinherited: Journal of a Palestinian Exile , who lives in Washington. "Israel may have evacuated its miserable colonists and soldiers from Gaza but it continues to control its airspace, offshore maritime access and its borders, determining the flow of goods, produce and people ... "The cumulative impact of sustained economic hardship, coupled with living under the thumb of a foreign occupier can be devastating to an individual's psychological, even cognitive and social functioning ... "Communities made inert by repression, social immobility or economic deprivation, will build up an inescapable drive towards war, towards an assertion of identity at the cost of mutual destruction." The World Bank, too, recently criticized the Israeli stranglehold on Gaza and the West Bank, the latter cut up into "ever smaller and disconnected cantons." Neither the Palestinian civil war nor the breakdown of the months-long ceasefire with Israel should have come as a surprise. Lebanon: About 400,000 Palestinian refugees there remain marginalized â€“ denied citizenship and restricted to menial jobs. It is in one of their 12 camps that Beirut is battling Fatah al-Islam, which vows to "fight the Jews and take the holy war to the frontiers of Palestine." Rushing U.S. military supplies to Prime Minister Fouad Siniora may help him crush this militia, but it won't guarantee that others won't emerge. Fatah al-Islam may or may not be the creation of Syria. The more relevant point is that it is easy for anyone to start a militia in the midst of misery. The other point is that Lebanon is politically paralyzed between pro- and anti-Hezbollah elements. Attacking Fatah al-Islam is easy, disarming the Hezbollah is not, so strong it emerged from last year's Israeli invasion. Iraq and Afghanistan: The U.S. presence in both has been a boon to terrorists. The U.S. State Department says terrorism shot up 25 per cent last year â€“14,338 attacks that killed 20,498 people, most in Iraq and Afghanistan. The leader of Fatah al-Islam was an associate of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the notorious Al Qaeda terrorist who was killed in Iraq last summer. Other jihadis from Iraq may be operating well beyond Lebanon, as indicated by terrorist incidents in Morocco and Algeria. Jihadi tactics from Iraq are being copied in Afghanistan. Propping up prime ministers Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad and Hamid Karzai in Kabul won't guarantee any more success than propping up Abbas and Siniora. They have been rendered ineffective by the Israeli and American policies of occupations and endless war, with criminal disregard for civilian casualties and human suffering. Enter the radicals â€“ and Iran. Bilateral U.S.-Iran talks, long overdue and at last underway, won't end the carnage in Iraq. Tehran has little incentive to help there while the U.S. â€“ backed by some Sunni Arab dictators â€“ continues its sabre-rattling over the Iranian nuclear program. "The failure to find political and institutional solutions in Palestine, Lebanon and Iraq, along with the American rivalry with Iran for regional influence, has stirred up all kinds of conflicts and created a field day for militias, large and small," says Prof. Jim Reilly, a University of Toronto expert on the Middle East.

Andrew Lugovoi, the suspect named by Britain, has stated that British intelligence services killed the Russian spy Litvinenko after they failed to recruit him to try and undermine the Putin government. Lugovoi has completely denied all accusatioins that he committed the murder of he Russian spy which took place last November. Litvinenko died after being poisoned with polonium-210, a radioactive isotope. The suspect is claiming that he was framed and offered three different theories for the death of the Russian spy. British spy agency MI6 was involved in one of the theories as to how he was killed. &#8220;I would have had to have been an idiot if I hadn&#8217;t realised that instead of trying to hire me for business reasons I was being hired to discredit President Putin,&#8221; Mr Lugovoi stated at a conference. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t prepared to go through with it. I didn&#8217;t want to betray my country. The last time I met Litvinenko, I told him that this business didn&#8217;t interest me. Litvinenko was very annoyed with me for that. The widow of Litvinenko did not comment on any allegations, nor did MI6. Other theories included the Russian mafia and the British Government itself.

The next act is expected to play out much the same next week, when the world&#8217;s most powerful economic leaders meet at the G-8 Summit in Germany to discuss the world&#8217;s climate and what should be done to stabilize it. Today, Bush proposed a new plan for climate that has been criticized as &#8220;a charade. Europe and Japan want strict caps on greenhouse gas emissions. Developing countries only want to shoulder the burden for their relatively recent contributions to the problem, and they want to see historic polluters pony up. The U.S. stands alone in its resistance to most any action. Meanwhile, states and cities, celebrities, companies and households are taking action. The willpower to act seems everywhere present but the White House. Extreme Weather Takes Toll On Crops Offshore Oil Rigs Ready For Storms Copyright 2007 The Christian Science Publishing Society G-8 to take up climate change Brad Knickerbocker Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor The international squabble over climate change - who's to blame and how to deal with it - is coming to a boil as many of the major players prepare to meet in Germany next week. In essence, Europe and Japan want stricter controls on greenhouse gases and a faster timetable for reducing them. Major developing countries, China and India, say advanced Western industrialized nations need to make the first cuts; and the United States increasingly looks like the Lone Ranger as it resists diplomatic efforts to join in a coordinated plan to battle global warming. The differences became apparent earlier this week when the environmental group Greenpeace leaked documents "showing the United States has raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration" for next week's Group of Eight summit, according to the French press service AFP. Germany is hosting the G-8 meeting in Heiligendamm June 6-8. The G-8 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Britain, and the United States, with the 27-nation European Union (EU) participating as well. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to secure a major climate change deal, including agreement to slow the rise in average temperatures this century to 2 degrees Celsius, a cut in global greenhouse-gas emissions by 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and an increase in energy efficiency in power generation and transportation of 20 percent by 2020, the BBC reported. But the US has raised objections to a draft communique prepared for the summit, reports the BBC and other news sources, quoting documents first released by Greenpeace. "The changes strike out entire sentences and significantly reduce the certainty with which the statement addresses climate change," reports the BBC. In red ink, American negotiators wrote: "The US still has serious, fundamental concerns about this draft statement.... The treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses 'multiple red lines' in terms of what we simply cannot agree to.... We have tried to 'tread lightly' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the German position." China and India have joined the US in opposing strict international agreements to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Said Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, following a meeting this week with EU officials in Hamburg, Germany, as reported by AFP: "Our position is that we are a developing nation, and climate change is not the doing of developing countries, though every country has to do what it can to help the environment.... "China's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world, and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line, so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment." China is not a member of the G-8 but was invited to the summit along with Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa. on the subject echo China's. Pradipto Ghosh, India's environment secretary, was quoted May 28 by the Press Trust of India news agency as saying "Legally mandated measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are likely to have significant adverse impacts on GDP growth of developing countries, including India. [Plans to cut greenhouse gases could also have] serious implications for our poverty-alleviation programs. This is not the path we want to pursue." African countries will not be directly involved in next week's G-8 discussions on global warming. But their interests are being voiced by Oxfam, the British aid and relief organization. Rich countries are obliged to help developing countries adapt to climate change, Oxfam asserts - an effort that could cost at least $50 billion a year, reported Britain's Financial Times. Said Oxfam senior researcher Kate Raworth: "This is not about aid, it is about the world's biggest and richest polluters covering the costs forced upon those who are most vulnerable.... Developing countries cannot and should not be expected to foot the bill for the impact of rich countries' emissions." Beginning with its rejection of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, the US has resisted international controls on its energy production and use - particularly as they relate to climate change. The US has aired two chief objections: that major developing countries (including China) are wrongly exempted from its targets and timetables for reducing greenhouse gases and that the Kyoto agreement would harm the US economy. US officials voiced those concerns this week in Darwin, Australia, where representatives of the 21 Pacific Rim countries making up the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum met to plan the group's summit in September, where climate change will be a key issue. Said US Deputy Secretary of Energy Clay Sell, as quoted by the Associated Press: "Each country brings its own unique circumstances, its own assets, its limitations.... A strong economy is the key enabler to addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions." Along with the US, Australia (the fourth-largest coal producer in the world) has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. At the Darwin meeting, the two countries said they want to discuss ways to develop clean technologies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions before any carbon-reduction schemes are considered. Said Australian Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane: "Once we know how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the challenge will then be to have those technologies employed and to set targets."

With the United States accused of dragging its feet on combatting climate change, Bush called for a meeting this fall of 15 countries identified as major emitters of greenhouse gases. This list would include the United States, China, India and major European countries. The president outlined his proposal in a speech ahead of next week's summit in Germany of leading industrialized nations, where global warming is to be a major topic. Bush urged other nations to eliminate tariffs on clean energy technologies. Germany, which holds the European Union and Group of Eight presidencies, is proposing a so-called "two-degree" target, whereby global temperatures would be allowed to increase no more than 2 degrees Celsius &#8212; the equivalent of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit &#8212; before being brought back down. Practically, experts have said that means a global reduction in emissions of 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The United States has rejected that approach. Instead, Bush called for nations to hold a series of meetings, beginning this fall, to set a global emission goal. Each nation then would have to decide on how to achieve the goal, White House officials said. Bush's critics were quick to respond, even before the president's speech had concluded. Daniel J. Weiss, climate strategy director for the liberal Center for American Progress, said the Bush administration has a "do-nothing" policy on global warming despite U.S. allies' best efforts to spur U.S. reductions. "Our allies' pleas for action add to the voices of many big corporations such as Dow, Shell, General Electric, and General Motors," Weiss said. "These and other Fortune 500 companies endorsed a 60 percent to 80 percent reduction in global warming pollution by 2050, the level scientists indicate that we must reach to stave off the worst impacts. Unfortunately, these appeals from his foreign and corporate allies continue to fall on President Bush's deaf ears." The U.S. last year actually experienced a drop in emissions of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas most blamed for global warming. The 1.3 percent decline from 2005, the first drop in 11 years, was due to a mild winter followed by a cool summer. Carbon dioxide is produced from burning fossil fuels, including natural gas and coal, which are used widely to produce electricity to heat homes in winter and run air conditioners in summer. While Bush announced his new proposal, the administration registered its opposition to a number of approaches to combat global warming. Specifically, the White House said it does not support a global carbon-trading program allowing countries to buy and sell carbon credits to meet limits on carbon dioxide levels. The White House also expressed opposition to energy efficiency targets advocated by the EU, arguing that a standard applicable in one country does not fit another.

Hundreds of Iraqi and US troops today carried out raids in the Sadr City area of Baghdad as the search for the five Britons kidnapped yesterday intensified. The sprawling Shia district, in the north-east of the Iraqi capital, is a stronghold of the Mahdi Army militia. The Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, today said the Mahdi Army - loosely controlled by the radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr - could have been behind the abductions of a financial expert and four bodyguards from the finance ministry building near Sadr City. Iraqi forces have established a special battalion of Iraqi soldiers and police officers to search for the missing men. Sadr City residents reported that hundreds of US and Iraqi troops had sealed off areas of the neighborhood overnight, carrying out a series of raids that lasted until dawn. "We are conducting search operations near the site where the abduction took place," Brigadier General Qassim al-Musawi, an Iraqi army spokesman, said. "Maybe today, or in the coming few days, we will find them [the Britons] with the help of secret intelligence." Not all today's military activity in Sadr City was linked to the kidnappings, with the US military saying five people had been arrested on suspicion of weapons smuggling. The kidnappers wore police uniforms, had the appropriate identification papers and drove up to the ministry building in 19 four-wheel drive vehicles of a type used by officers. Mr Zebari, who described the abduction of the five Britons as sophisticated, acknowledged the possible involvement of corrupt elements of the interior ministry police in the operation. "It has been a known fact for some time that the interior ministry police, security units and forces are corrupt, are penetrated," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program. "This issue is a very serious, challenging fact to the government itself. "The number of people who were involved in the operation, to seal off the building, to set roadblocks and to get into the building with such confidence, must have some connection." The seized British security guards worked for a private firm, while the financial expert has been advising the Iraqi government. They were abducted just before noon in what appeared to be a carefully planned assault intended to give the impression it was a government-sanctioned operation. According to one witness's account, a group of gunmen stormed into a hall where a western adviser was giving a lecture, shouting: "Where are the foreigners?" The gunmen - led by a man in a police major's uniform - then rounded up the five and left. In London, the cabinet's Cobra crisis committee held an emergency meeting to discuss the situation, and Tony Blair said the government would "do everything we possibly can to help". Today, the foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, attending a meeting of the G8 nations in Berlin, said it was "clearly a very distressing time for all concerned", adding: "Foreign Office officials are offering help and assistance to the next of kin. "It is not sensible at this stage to speculate on what might have happened. We are working closely with the Iraqi authorities to establish the facts, and doing all we can to secure their swift and safe release." Employees at the finance ministry are likely to be questioned about how the kidnappers were able to enter the building, seize the Britons and leave with no apparent resistance. Bayan Jabr, the finance minister, is a conservative Shia politician who has been accused by Sunnis of fomenting sectarian violence, but he is a senior member of a Shia group that is a rival to the Mahdi Army. The missing Britons have not been named for their own safety. The security guards were working for GardaWorld, a Canadian-based firm employing mainly British ex-soldiers. The finance expert was working for BearingPoint, a US management consultancy based in Virginia, which won a contract to help rebuild the Iraqi financial system in 2003. &#169; Copyright Guardian Newspapers 2006 Use the feedback form below to submit your comments.

The shipment came hours after a deeply divided UN Security Council approved a resolution to unilaterally establish a tribunal on the murder of former prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri. It also came even as Russia warned the US Wednesday against further destabilizing Lebanon with US arms shipments and to closely follow international agreements in delivering such aid. Last week the US sent several plane loads of military aid to Lebanon, including ammunition and other equipment, to bolster the Siniora government. "As far as the shipment of arms to the region is concerned, we have always assumed that it is necessary for international agreements to be adhered to," said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. "We also know that it is necessary to prevent the shipment of arms that might serve to destabilize the situation," he said at a news conference in Berlin. The US has provided about $45 million in military aid to the Siniora government over the past year and last week the US Congress approved an additional $280 in military assistance. On Thursday, Lebanese newspapers said that the UN move to set up the tribunal could spell more instability for Lebanon. Lebanon's Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said the Security Council has ignored the country's constitution in voting to set up the tribunal. He said the Security Council has also ignored a need for Lebanese consensus on the court. "You have picked internationalization instead of the state," Berri, a leading member of the opposition, said in a brief statement. Berri had refused to call parliament to vote on UN plans for the court because he contests the legitimacy of the Beirut government, which is controlled by allies of Western states. "What is most important for the tribunal is to have people who are accused. Where are the accused?" Christian Maronite opposition leader Michel Aoun told French radio before the vote. The governing coalition, including Saad al-Hariri, son of the former premier, had made establishment of the tribunal a priority and welcomed the Security Council vote as a victory for Lebanon. The opposition has said the tribunal will be used as a political tool by the US. Hezbollah and its allies have always said they support the idea of the tribunal but wanted to discuss its mandate. Omar Neshabi, writing in the pro-opposition Al-Akhbar newspaper, said setting up the court without consensus "raises serious concern for security and stability". "New York has imposed the tribunal on Lebanon... who will impose harmony between the Lebanese?" said the As-Safir newspaper. Lebanon's immediate neighbor Syria also denounced the tribunal, calling it an attempt by Washington to avenge itself for thwarted policies in the Middle East. "It seemed clear during the debates preceding the vote that the American administration wanted to avenge itself of those opposed to its invasions and policies in the region," the daily Tishrin said. The newspaper said the vote, with 10 of the 15 members voting in favor and five abstaining, did not represent the will of the international community. "This is an Israeli-American resolution par excellence, which cannot be interpreted as the will of the international community, as the strong divisions on the Security Council demonstrated." Wheile the six co-sponsors -- the US, Britain, France, Belgium, Slovakia and Italy -- hailed the text other nations expressed concern about interfering in an already unstable situation. Veto-wielding members Russia and China, as well as non-permanent members South Africa, Indonesia and Qatar all abstained. Tishrin said that the bulk of world opinion is actually against the resolution because "Qatar represents Arab countries on the Security Council, Indonesia the Muslim world, South Africa the non-aligned nations, while China and Russia are two superpowers." Ath-Thawra, another Syrian newspaper, said the resolution "represents a politicization of the investigation into the Hariri assassination and reflects the flagrant interference of the United States in the region's affairs". It slammed the resolution as "damaging the sovereignty of Lebanon and its national unity, increasing the (political) differences". Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin objected to the reference to Chapter Seven of the UN Charter, which dispenses with parliament's approval to set up the court. He also called the resolution "dubious from the standpoint of international law" as it bypasses the requirements of Lebanon's constitutional process. Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz al-Nasser of Qatar, the lone Arab member of the council, expressed fear the ruling "would not bring stability in Lebanon". He said the decision involved "legal encroachment that may further complicate the situation". Youths watch a Jordanian military plane, carrying US ammunition, arrives in Beirut international airport.

Jim Tracy, the county's highest-ranking Republican, said Wednesday night he welcomes signs that former U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson is about to enter the presidential fray. Thompson, whose possible candidacy has been a topic of speculation for months, revealed plans this week to form an exploratory committee, the first step towards a presidential campaign. He has also announced that he is leaving his role on the TV drama "Law & Order." "I've known Fred pretty much all my life," said Tracy. "I think he'll make a great candidate, and I think folks from all parts of the political spectrum can support Fred." Tracy praised Thompson as "very intelligent, a good communicator ... a strong leader." Tracy said he agrees with Thompson on most issues. "He'll gain a lot of support," said Tracy, who represents Bedford, Moore and part of Rutherford counties in the General Assembly. Thompson, 64, is thought to appeal to conservatives unhappy with the three GOP front-runners, Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney and John McCain. Thompson will make his first formal campaign move in the coming days, establishing an official organization to weigh a White House bid while launching a major fundraising drive on Monday, according to several Republicans with knowledge of his plans. Speaking on condition of anonymity because the timeline is not public, these officials said Thompson may visit early primary states in late June and could officially enter the race as early as the first week in July. "Senator Thompson is still seriously considering getting into the presidential contest and he is doing everything he has to do to make that final decision," said Mark Corallo, a Thompson spokesman. "Stay tuned." On Thompson's schedule in the coming weeks: a speech to Virginia Republicans in Richmond on Saturday and an appearance on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" on June 12. One official said an overseas trip also may be in the works. For months, Thompson has openly flirted with a candidacy as a Tennessee-based effort sought to draft him into the race. He made several high-profile moves that pointed to a bid, not the least of which was disclosing that he is in remission after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a form of cancer. His popularity in national polls spiked to double digits early in the year, but while he still fares well in surveys, his numbers have fallen following what some Republicans considered a subpar speech in early May in California. Thompson was elected to the Senate in 1994, defeating then-Shelbyville resident Jim Cooper for the open seat which had once belonged to Vice President Al Gore. During his Senate tenure, which ended in 2002, Thompson was considered a reliably conservative vote. He worked to limit the role of the federal government and backed a ban on a late-term abortion procedure. He voted in favor of Bush's tax cuts, oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, eliminating money for the National Endowment for the Arts and a constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration. And, he voted against requiring criminal background checks for purchases at gun shows. But he sometimes took paths that didn't necessarily sit well with conservatives, including advocating for campaign finance reform. While he voted to oust President Clinton from office, he also was one of 10 Republican senators who voted against one of the two impeachment charges. Social issues, important to the party's right, also typically weren't at the top of his agenda. He was known less as a legislator and more as an investigator, leading the committee that examined former President Clinton's fundraising in 1996. Yet, he established a reputation as a less-than-hard worker. The Democratic National Committee issued a research document Wednesday detailing Thompson's major legislative accomplishments. Save for the title and a DNC disclaimer, it was blank. Thompson was one of the few senators who backed underdog McCain in 2000 over George W. Bush, the establishment candidate. This time around, Thompson would be opposing McCain -- and could hurt his friend's own shot at the White House. The two have similar Senate records but Thompson could be seen as a fresher face to McCain, who is well-known to GOP voters. Romney, who is trying to position himself to the right of the major candidates, also could see his support fall among conservatives concerned about his shifts on issues. Campaigning in Iowa, Romney said he welcomed a Thompson entry. "I think he'll make the race more interesting. He's got good ideas and after all, he does put bad people in jail every week on 'Law & Order,"' he said. Giuliani could be hindered as well if Thompson grabs the attention of Republicans uneasy with the former New York City mayor's support for gay and abortion rights. Over the next few days, Thompson plans to form a "testing the waters" committee called "Friends of Fred Thompson," which will allow him to begin raising money, hire staff and gauge support without officially committing to a White House bid. He could significantly dampen the fundraising ability of his potential GOP rivals during the homestretch of the second quarter financial reporting period. "It's going to cause everybody to have second thoughts about writing a check," said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist who is unaligned in the race. Thompson spoke on a conference call Wednesday to several dozen people who officials called "First Day Founders" and said committed to raising money for him. Participants said they were asked to raise $46,000 apiece, the $2,300 maximum from 10 couples or 20 people. Officials cautioned that Thompson has made no final decision.

Thaksin, deposed in a September coup, was last night judged to have violated election laws in an April 2006 snap poll by a junta-appointed tribunal. The nine judges disbanded his Thai Rak Thai party and slapped five-year political bans on 111 of its executives. Thailand&#39;s junta, which wants to pass a new constitution via referendum before elections promised for December, may find it hard to get support from the millions of Thais who gave Thaksin a record mandate of 377 of 500 parliamentary seats in 2005. The exiled leader called the ruling harsh and unexpected. ``The confrontation that we&#39;ve had in Thailand over the past two years is now likely to deepen,&#39;&#39; said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. ``There&#39;s a very large electorate that has been left dangling.&#39;&#39; ``It is certain that people around the country won&#39;t accept this ruling,&#39;&#39; Chaturon Chaisang, acting leader of Thai Rak Thai, told supporters at the party headquarters in Bangkok last night. ``The country is under the rule of military dictators. The country is under a regime that is not acceptable in the international community.&#39;&#39; The same judges absolved the Democrat Party of offenses including preventing parties from contesting last year&#39;s election via a boycott. Members of that party, Thailand&#39;s oldest and Thaksin&#39;s main opposition when he was in power, will be able to take part in planned December elections. ``This is a huge political windfall for the Democrat Party&#39;&#39; said Thitinan of Chulalongkorn University. ``They lost recent elections. Now the Democrat Party looks like they will lead the next coalition.&#39;&#39; Among 44 political parties listed on the Web site of the Office of the Election Commission of Thailand as of February, Thai Rak Thai was the largest, with 14.4 million members. The Democrat Party was second biggest with 4.1 million members. Korn Chatikavanij, deputy secretary-general of the Democrat Party in Thailand, said that his party was ``sympathetic&#39;&#39; to Thai Rak Thai members and would ``reach out to them.&#39;&#39; Thaksin, in a statement issued by his lawyer Noppadol Pattama, said the verdict ``will be studied and criticized for a long time&#39;&#39; and called on the junta to return democracy to the people quickly. He called on Thai Rak Thai members to continue with political activity ``for the benefit of the country.&#39;&#39; ``People have been quiet so far,&#39;&#39; said James McCormack, head of Asian sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings. ``But the first opportunity people have to voice an opinion is this referendum that&#39;s coming up in the middle of the year.&#39;&#39; Bangkok was peaceful during the reading of the verdict Wednesday afternoon and night and on Thursday. Thailand&#39;s junta deployed more than 10,000 soldiers and police in the capital, and said today it would maintain an indefinite national security clampdown, according to AFP. ``Security measures have been stepped up since last night and will gradually be increased,&#39;&#39; Army Chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin told the news agency. ``The measures will be in place for a long time.&#39;&#39; The tribunal last night found Pongsak Raktapongpaisal, Thaksin&#39;s former transport minister, and Thammarak Isarangura Na Ayutthaya, his ex-defense minister, guilty of paying candidates from smaller parties to run in an April 2006 election that was later annulled. The two small parties are the Thai Ground Party and Pattana Chartthai Party, the judges said. ``Banning those executives is aimed at preventing them from having a chance to cause damage to the country again,&#39;&#39; Judge Krairerk Kasemsant said while delivering the verdict, broadcast on state-controlled radio and television. With staunch support from Thailand&#39;s majority rural voters, Thai Rak Thai, or `Thais Love Thais&#39; captured a record number of parliamentary seats in Feb. 2005 elections, delivering the first absolute majority in the country&#39;s history and making Thaksin the first prime minister elected for two consecutive terms. Thaksin&#39;s overthrow followed months of protests against his rule and the election he called in an attempt to quell them. That vote was boycotted by the opposition and later voided for the charges ruled on yesterday. To contact the reporters on this story: Dominic G.

The blue chip company has allegedly been involved with the Central Intelligence Agency with â€œthe forced disappearance, torture and inhumane treatmentâ€ of three men suspected of being terrorists. According to the suit, â€œPublicly available records demonstrate that Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret rendition flights over a four-year period to countries where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted legal standardsâ€. The three men on behalf of whom the suit was brought includes Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian, who was allegedly mistreated in July 2002 and January 2004; Elkassim Britel, an Italian, who was first apprehended in Pakistan and subjected to torture in May 2002 and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian who, while seeking asylum in Sweden was arrested by Swedish police and handed over to the CIA, underwent torture in December 2001. While Mohamed is currently being held in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Britel is being held in Morocco and Agiza in Egypt. Mike pound, a spokesperson for Jeppesen has said, â€œThere isn't really anything I can say with the exception that I am aware of the suit. We have not been served. I can't talk specifics about any customers that we might have or the services we might provide for themâ€. Boeingâ€™s representative Timothy Neale has commented, â€œWe have not gotten the lawsuit yet, so we are not commenting on it. We are not confirming the reports that Jeppesen did work for the CIA. The services Jeppesen provides are provided on a confidential basis for all its customers.â€ The suit alleges that the detainees were taken to countries where they underwent inhumane, degrading treatment and torture since they were beyond the reach of the law. The suit also states that Jeppesen provided services to the flight and crew used in the rendition program â€œto unlawfully render plaintiffs to detention and interrogation in Morocco, Egypt and Afghanistanâ€. The suspects were apprehended under the U.S. government's â€œextraordinary rendition programâ€. Extraordinary rendition is the clandestine capture and transfer of suspects to be detained and interrogated in countries where the protection of U.S. laws does not apply, said Ben Wizner, an ACLU attorney. He also said that â€œEither they knew or reasonably should have known that they were facilitating a torture program.â€ The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

Mr Abhisit yesterday called on the Council for National Security junta to lift its embargo on public political activities and to allow members of the banned Thai Rak Thai party to form new groups. "We encourage the regime to open up a political space, to remove restrictions on the formation of new parties, to allow supporters of Thai Rak Thai to regroup and use the parliamentary system," said Mr Abhisit. "The country needs at this moment stability by setting a clear road map for democracy," he told the CNBC satellite news service. "Even the military must now feel the pressure. The experience of the last six to seven months has proved there is no other alternative to democracy to restore stability and solve (our) economic problems." CNS chief General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, who overthrew Thaksin Shinawatra's Thai Rak Thai government on September 19, said he would consult military-appointed prime minister General Surayud Chulanont about lifting the political activities ban within a fortnight. The generals have offered a tentative timetable for a popular vote on a new draft constitution in September and national elections, though under sharply different conditions from the 1997 constitution, by mid-December. The junta had been awaiting Wednesday night's Constitutional Tribunal verdicts before taking further steps towards the promised restoration of a democratic government. The tribunal's decisions to sustain allegations of electoral abuses against Thai Rak Thai during the abortive April 2006 election campaign but to exonerate the Democrats has left 50-year-old Mr Abhisit as Thailand's only likely next prime minister. As a result of Wednesday's rulings, described by one Bangkok pundit as "a political massacre", Mr Thaksin and 110 other Thai Rak Thai executives - the politicians who ran Thailand from early 2001 until the coup - have been banned from politics for the next five years. Chaturon Chaisaeng, Thai Rak Thai's acting leader while Mr Thaksin remains indefinitely based in London, said in a statement yesterday the party was looking at ways of challenging the banning orders. Mr Chaturon was apparently relying on reports that the tribunal's decision to convict Thai Rak Thai and exonerate the Democrats was not unanimous. However, the interim national constitution allows no appeal against a tribunal decision. At best, Thai Rak Thai supporters can hope to be allowed to register a new party in the same name as the dissolved group. Their only recourse appears to be a direct appeal to the interim government, which is filled with Mr Thaksin's opponents. However, the military and the interim government remain wary of provoking widespread civil disobedience among supporters of Mr Thaksin, who remains widely popular, especially among Thailand's poor rural dwellers. In its judgment on Wednesday night, the Constitution Tribunal acknowledged Thai Rak Thai's membership still numbered 14 million, in a total population of 61.5 million. The military and police maintained tight security in the capital yesterday, although by the evening none of the feared mass demonstrations by Thai Rak Thai supporters had eventuated. Mr Thaksin in London yesterday released a message urging his supporters to accept the tribunal ruling and calling on the junta to convene elections as soon as possible. "Although I announced that I would wash my hands out of politics, I would like to urge (party) members to work and implement political activities for the sake of the country and the people," he said in a letter read out in Bangkok by his lawyer, Noppadon Pattama. The 57-year-old former telecommunications tycoon, whose party in 2005 was the first in Thai electoral history to win an absolute majority of votes and seats, apologised to his supporters that their efforts had come to such an end.

Some 2,000 people rallied peacefully near Government House a day after the ruling, shouting slogans against the coup leaders who ousted Thaksin in a bloodless putsch last year. The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article "Democracy Back, Thaksin Come Back," read one banner held by a protester wearing a "CNS Get Out" headband, referring to the name the generals gave themselves, the Council for National Security. "Although Thai Rak Thai has been banned, we still love Thaksin," Jatuporn Prompan, a rally organizer and former party spokesman, told the crowd from the stage. "The Constitutional Tribunal has ruled that Thai Rak Thai has committed a crime that was hostile to democracy. But who will make that ruling on the CNS which toppled a democratically elected government?," Jatuporn said. Earlier, Thaksin, who is living in London, issued a statement urging his supporters to accept the ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal, which found his party guilty of two charges of fraud in last year's inconclusive poll, later annulled by the courts. He also pressed the generals to speed up elections promised for December. Analysts say the plan could be derailed by unrest. "I would urge everyone to stay calm and don't make any moves," said the billionaire telecoms tycoon whose Thai Rak Thai (Thais Loves Thais) party was the first in Thai history to win an absolute parliamentary majority. There has been no violence since the ruling, but police set up extra checkpoints across the city of 10 million people. "Nothing has happened yet, but we are worried that a third party could cause trouble," the Bangkok police chief, Lieutenant-General Adisorn Nonsee, told reporters. The rival Democrat Party, Thailand's oldest party but no match for Thaksin's machine in the vote-rich countryside, was found not guilty of breaking election laws, and should now be in pole position for the promised December election.

"So my proposal is this: By the end of next year, America and other nations will set a long-term global goal for reducing greenhouse gases," Bush said in a speech outlining his agenda at next month's meeting of leaders of the Group of Eight industrialized nations in Germany. The talks would include China and India, the developing world's fast growing economies that are also among the top emitters of greenhouse gases. Bush said the United States would convene a series of meetings aimed at setting a global goal while requiring each country to establish mid-term national targets. The talks come after the White House resisted calls for global emissions-reduction goals over the first six years of the Bush presidency. Bush, in his speech, emphasized technological efforts aimed at improving energy efficiency. "The world is on the verge of great breakthroughs that will help us become better stewards of the environment," Bush said. "Over the past six years, my administration has spent, along with the Congress, more than $12 billion in research on clean energy technology. We're the world's leader when it comes to figuring out new ways to power our economy and be good stewards of the environment." William L. Watts is a reporter for MarketWatch.

See a photo you want? Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Thursday, May 31, 2007 Posted on Thu, May. 31, 2007 Thompson acting as prez hopeful "He&#0039;s not Ronald Reagan, but he&#0039;s Reaganesque," said Ted Malloch of Palm Beach, Fla., CEO of a consulting firm and a supporter of Fred Thompson (above). WASHINGTON - Fred Thompson, the former Tennessee senator and "Law & Order" actor, is taking significant steps toward an expected summer entry into the crowded but extraordinarily unsettled Republican presidential race. His likely candidacy could give restless conservatives somewhere to turn. A crucial bloc of the GOP, those voters have not fully embraced the leading contenders, giving Thompson what his backers argue is an opening for a "true conservative" who can triumph in November 2008. Thompson, 64, would bring a right-leaning Senate voting record with a few digressions from GOP orthodoxy and a dash of Hollywood star power given his many movie roles and TV stint as the gruff district attorney on NBC's popular crime drama. A Thompson bid also could make the contest to succeed President Bush even more topsy-turvy; all three top-tier candidates - Rudy Giuliani, John McCain and Mitt Romney - could lose some support and the seven underdogs could become even more irrelevant. Thompson will make his first formal campaign move in the coming days, establishing an official organization to weigh a White House bid while launching a major fundraising drive on Monday, according to several Republicans with knowledge of his plans. Speaking on condition of anonymity because the timeline is not public, these officials said that Thompson may visit early primary states in late June and could officially enter the race as early as the first week in July. "Senator Thompson is still seriously considering getting into the presidential contest, and he is doing everything he has to do to make that final decision," said Mark Corallo, a Thompson spokesman. "Stay tuned." On Thompson's schedule in the coming weeks: a speech to Virginia Republicans in Richmond on Saturday and an appearance with Jay Leno on "The Tonight Show" on June 12. One official said an overseas trip also may be in the works. For months, Thompson has openly flirted with a candidacy as a Tennessee-based effort sought to draft him into the race. He made several high-profile moves that pointed to a bid, not the least of which was disclosing that he is in remission after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a form of cancer. His popularity in national polls spiked to double digits early in the year, but while he still fares well in surveys, his numbers have fallen following what some Republicans considered a subpar speech in early May in California. That's prompted some rumblings in GOP circles that Thompson may have missed his opportunity to make a splash in the race. Undaunted, Thompson has been casting himself as a straight-talking conservative in the mold of President Ronald Reagan in speeches and on the Internet. "He's not Ronald Reagan, but he's Reaganesque," said Ted Malloch of Palm Beach, Fla., chief executive of a consulting firm, who is supporting Thompson. "Fred is unique in the sense that all the boxes have been checked." During his 1994-2002 Senate tenure, he was considered a reliably conservative vote. He worked to limit the role of the federal government and backed a ban on a late-term -abortion procedure. He voted in favor of Bush's tax cuts, of oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, of eliminating money for the National Endowment for the Arts and of a constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration. And, he voted against requiring criminal background checks for purchases at gun shows. But he sometimes took paths that didn't necessarily sit well with conservatives, including advocating for campaign-finance reform. Although he voted to oust President Bill Clinton from office, he also was one of 10 Republican senators who voted against one of the two impeachment charges. Social issues, important to the party's right, also typically weren't at the top of his agenda. He was known less as a legislator and more as an investigator, leading the committee that examined Clinton's fundraising in 1996. Yet, he established a reputation as a less-than-hard worker. The Democratic National Committee issued a research document yesterday detailing Thompson's major legislative accomplishments. Save for the title and a DNC disclaimer, it was blank. Thompson was one of the few senators who backed underdog McCain in 2000 over George W. Bush, the establishment candidate. This time around, Thompson would oppose McCain - and could hurt his friend's own shot at the White House. The two have similar Senate records, but Thompson could be seen as a fresher face than McCain, who is well-known to GOP voters. * Updated 10:00 AM EDT MOST VIEWED IN THIS SECTION A Universe of boos for the U.S. Texas mother hangs kids, herself Jury: Death for educator who killed 5 May is 3rd-deadliest month of war; 5 Britons kidnapped Court kills $3.8M award in sex-bias case Updated 10:00 AM EDT MOST VIEWED ON PHILLY.COM Time served, deportation for groping on a plane Eagles&#0039; Abiamiri a confident pick Two: Had drinks, woke being raped Stephen A.

The report, "Enduring Occupation: Palestinians Under Siege on the West Bank," released on Monday, launched a scathing attack on Israel on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the 1967 Six-Day War, which began four decades ago on Tuesday. As a result of that war, Israel gained control over the entire West Bank, Gaza Strip -- and their Palestinian populations -- the Sinai Desert and Golan Heights, which had previously been under the occupation of Jordan, Egypt and Syria respectively. Israel offered to return all of the Golan Heights and Sinai Desert in exchange for full peace treaties with Syria and Egypt and offered the creation of a Palestinian entity. But in September of that year, Arab states gathered for a summit in Khartoum in which they affirmed what has become known as the "three no's:" no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel and no negotiations with it. In 1979, Egypt became the first Arab nation to sign a full peace treaty with Israel, and in 1994, Jordan became the second, but the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remained. The 45-page AI report calls on Israel to remove roadblocks and restrictions on Palestinian travel, remove the security barrier between Israel and the West Bank, and remove Israeli settlements -- where more than 225,000 Israelis currently live on land that they believe was given to them by God as an eternal inheritance known biblically as Judea and Samaria. The report documents what AI calls the "relentless expansion of unlawful settlements on occupied land that deprives the Palestinian population of crucial resources and documents a plethora of measures that confine Palestinians to fragmented enclaves and hinder their access to work, health and education facilities." One of the measures, it says, is the 700-kilometer (420-mile) barrier and more than 500 checkpoints and roadblocks. Israel's security barrier, which is sometimes a fence and sometimes a wall, juts at points into the West Bank where Palestinians want to establish a state. Israel credits the barrier with a dramatic reduction in suicide bomb attacks in its major population centers. "Palestinians living in the West Bank are blocked at every turn," charged Malcolm Smart, director for AI's Middle East and North Africa Program. "This is not simply an inconvenience -- it can be a matter of life or death" as they sometimes face long delays or detours en route to the hospital, he said. Israel rejected the findings of the report, saying it was /ldblquote one-sided, immoral and riddled with mistakes and numerous factual and legal inaccuracies, including scant mention of Palestinian terrorism, which holds non-combatants hostage, using them as human shields and camouflage."" Israel considers safeguarding human rights to be of "utmost importance," said Justice Ministry spokesman Moshe Cohen. The report does not acceptably deal with Israel's right of self-defense or its legitimate security needs, he said. "The lack of emphasis on the centrality of Palestinian terrorism and the [army's] responsibility to protect Israeli citizens as a direct result ... creates a deliberate distortion," Cohen said in a statement. Cohen also charged that the report totally disregarded the actions of Palestinian terrorist organizations "when they directly and indiscriminately target civilian populations while using the local population as human shields." Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said Israel has a problem with the "perspective" of the report and noted it is the only country in the region that values human rights. "Israel is the only country in the region where human rights are central to our political experience; the only country in the region with an independent professional and powerful judiciary; [and] the only country in the region where the security services, defense establishment are open to civilian scrutiny and judicial review," said Regev. Yisrael Medad, a resident of the Jewish West Bank settlement of Shilo and a volunteer spokesman for the Jewish communities there, said that the claim in the report that the barrier can be a "matter of life or death" for Palestinians is a "classic example of perverting morality." "They seem to prefer that Jews and Arabs die rather than seeing Israel even in a stopgap manner halting the cycle of death and terror," Medad said in a telephone interview. Medad said that the report had it backwards when it claimed that Israel was imposing "collective punishment" on the Palestinians by erecting roadblocks and placing travel restrictions on them. "If there is any collective punishment, it is that of the Arabs who single out every single Jew as a legitimate target for their illegitimate terror," said Medad. No international body has ever condemned the terrorism in the same manner that it has condemned Israel's right to self-defense, he said. Subscribe to the free CNSNews.com daily E-Brief.

US judge throws out case against Canadian June 5, 2007 - 6:30AM In a stunning reversal for the US administration's attempts to try Guantanamo detainees in military court, a military judge today dismissed terrorism-related charges against a prisoner charged with killing an American soldier in Afghanistan. The chief of military defence attorneys at Guantanamo Bay, marine Colonel Dwight Sullivan, said the ruling could spell the end of the war-crimes trial system set up last year by Congress and President George Bush after the Supreme Court threw out the previous system. Canadian detainee Omar Khadr, who was 15 when he was captured after a deadly firefight in Afghanistan and who is now 20, will remain at the remote US military base along with about 380 other men suspected of links to al-Qaeda and the Taliban. The judge, army Colonel Peter Brownback, said he had no choice but to throw out the Khadr case because he had been classified as an "enemy combatant" by a military panel years earlier - and not as an "alien unlawful enemy combatant". The Military Commissions Act, signed by Mr Bush last year, specifically says that only those classified as "unlawful" enemy combatants can face war trials here, Colonel Brownback noted during the arraignment in a hilltop courtroom. Colonel Sullivan told journalists the dismissal has "huge" impact because none of the detainees held at this isolated military base in south-east Cuba has been found to be an "unlawful" enemy combatant. "It is not just a technicality; it's the latest demonstration that this newest system just does not work," Colonel Sullivan told journalists. "It is a system of justice that does not comport with American values." Colonel Sullivan said in order to reclassify the detainees as "unlawful" combatants, the whole review system would have to be overhauled, a time-consuming act. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said because Brownbeck dismissed the case without prejudice, the US may be able to retry Khadr. He also said it is unclear whether the Combatant Status Review Tribunals will have to reclassify all detainees. A prosecuting attorney said he would appeal the dismissal. The new war-crimes trial system give prosecutors 72 hours to appeal, but the court designated to hear the appeal - known as the court of military commissions review - doesn't even exist, Colonel Sullivan noted. Colonel Sullivan said the judge hearing the case of the only other Guantanamo detainee currently charged with crimes is not bound by Colonel Brownback's ruling, but that he expected the same decision. That other detainee is Salim Ahmed Hamdan, who is accused of chauffeuring Osama bin Laden and being the al-Qaeda chief's bodyguard. His arraignment was scheduled for this afternoon. Australian David Hicks, the third detainee to be charged under the new system, pleaded guilty in March to providing material support for terrorism and has been sent home to Australia to serve a nine-month sentence. Under his plea agreement, Hicks agreed that he was "an alien unlawful enemy combatant, as defined by the Military Commissions Act". Colonel Brownback's ruling came just minutes into Khadr's arraignment on charges he committed murder in violation of the law of war, attempted murder in violation of the law of war, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism and spying. Khadr allegedly killed a US Army soldier with a grenade in the firefight, in which he was wounded. He appeared in the courtroom with a beard and wearing an olive-green prison uniform. "The charges are dismissed without prejudice," Colonel Brownback pronounced as he adjourned the proceeding. A prosecutor, army captain Keith Petty, said he had been prepared to show Khadr was an unlawful combatant because he fought for al-Qaeda, and videotapes showed Khadr making and planting explosives targeting American soldiers. Khadr seemed oblivious to the impact of the ruling. He calmly watched the judge throw out the case - looking not at Colonel Brownback but at a computer screen at the defence table that showed a live TV broadcast of the proceedings. Khadr could see himself on the screen. The US military has hoped to accelerate its prosecutions of Guantanamo detainees, with the Pentagon saying it expects to eventually charge about 80 of the 380 prisoners held at this isolated base, but questions lingered about the legitimacy of the process. The US Supreme Court, ruling in favour of a lawsuit brought by Hamdan, last June threw out a previous military tribunal system that was set up in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks, calling it unconstitutional. Congress responded by creating new guidelines for war-crimes trials and Bush signed them into law. Hamdan's lawyer, navy Lieutenant Commander Charles Swift, told The Associated Press he will challenge the new system as unconstitutional. For example, the Military Commissions Act retroactively made certain acts, such as conspiracy, a crime, Swift said. "This case raises significant questions" about the separation of powers, Swift said. "Congress cannot violate the Constitution to fix things ... but they are backdating anything and making it a crime." Hamdan is charged with conspiracy - centred on his alleged membership in al-Qaeda and purported role in plotting to attack civilians and civilian targets - and with providing material support for terrorism. As part of the second charge, Hamdan is accused of transporting at least one SA-7 surface-to-air missile to shoot down US and coalition military aircraft in Afghanistan in November 2001. Hamdan's alleged war crimes were committed between February 1996 and November 2001, according to the charge sheet. Swift, in the interview, said some acts predate the start of the Bush administration's war against terrorism, saying it generally is considered to be September 11, 2001. But army Lt-Col William Britt, the chief prosecutor in the Hamdan case, told the AP there is no established date when hostilities commenced and that the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre could be construed as the war's opening shot. In an interview yesterday at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington - as prosecutors, defence lawyers, human rights monitors and journalists waited to board a plane to Guantanamo for the arraignments - Britt said he expects a courtroom battle over the matters Swift raised. "These are novel issues," Britt said. "We're talking about new legislation, with the Military Commissions Act of 2006. We, the government, are looking forward to litigating (them)." The son of an alleged al-Qaeda financier, Khadr is accused of killing US Army Sergeant Christopher Speer with a grenade during a firefight in Afghanistan on July 27, 2002. Khadr's lawyers said he was a child soldier and should be rehabilitated, not imprisoned. "The US will be the first country in modern history to try an individual who was a child at the time of the alleged war crimes," the lawyers said in a joint statement in April.

"They were alive and then dead," a voice said during a sequence of images that included the military IDs of two Americans who are the subject of a massive manhunt south of Baghdad. The nearly 11-minute video offered no proof for its claims that the soldiers had been killed and buried, and the U.S. military insisted the search for the two missing soldiers would continue. "We condemn the tactics used by these terrorists, and are using all means available to pursue those responsible," said Brig. Gen. Kevin Bergner, the chief military spokesman in Baghdad. "We continue to search and hope that our two missing soldiers will be found alive and in good health." The nearly video, which included grainy black-and-white footage of what the Islamic State of Iraq said was taken during the May 12 predawn ambush on a road south of Baghdad, was the latest distraction for the U.S. military as it seeks to quell the sectarian violence raging in Iraq and pave the way for American forces to go home. Military officials also acknowledged Monday that U.S.-led forces have control of fewer than one-third of Baghdad&#039;s neighborhoods despite thousands of extra troops nearly four months into a security crackdown &#8212; an assessment that came as the U.S. death toll approached 3,500, with at least 15 American troops reported killed in the first three days of June. Today in Africa &#038; Middle East Dreams of college destroyed in Iraq Militant video shows missing soldiers&#x27; IDs Lebanon Army keeps up siege of Palestinian camps Lt. Col. Scott Bleichwehl, a military spokesman for Baghdad operations, confirmed that a status report completed in May found that American and Iraqi forces were able to "protect the population" and "maintain physical influence over" only 146 of the 457 Baghdad neighborhoods, while troops have either not begun operations aimed at rooting out insurgents or still face "resistance" in the others. It appeared to be the first comprehensive analysis of the progress of the operation that began Feb. 14. Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, is due to report in September on whether the current troop increase is working amid a fierce debate in Washington over whether President Bush should begin withdrawing American forces. But Bleichwehl stressed that the assessment, which was first reported by the New York Times, did not mean a lack of progress and said the setbacks were largely due to a higher-than-expected need to return to some areas that had previously been cleared, as well as problems with the availability and reliability of Iraqi police. "It&#039;s way too early to try and project what Baghdad will look like in September," he said in a telephone interview. U.S. officials also pointed out that they have warned from the beginning that it would not be easy to pacify Baghdad and did not expect to see serious progress until the fall amid unrelenting bombings by suspected Sunni insurgents and execution-style killings usually blamed on Shiite militias. "We have stated all along that this was going to be harder before it gets easier," military spokesman Lt. Col. Christopher Garver said. "It&#039;s going to be a tough fight over the summer and the plan is just in its beginning stages." The Bush administration, which has ordered some 30,000 extra American troops to Baghdad and surrounding areas as part of the security crackdown, has warned that the buildup will result in more U.S. casualties as more American soldiers come into contact with enemy forces and concentrate on the streets of Baghdad and remote outposts. The three U.S. soldiers were abducted after a 4:44 a.m. ambush as they were participating in an operation to watch for insurgents placing roadside bombs on a dangerous road near Mahmoudiya, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of Baghdad. The militants breached the concertina wire surrounding the stationary outpost composed of two Humvees, killing four other American troops and an Iraqi. The attack triggered a massive search in the area south of Baghdad known as the "triangle of death" for the rampant insurgent activity there. The Islamic State of Iraq issued Web statements shortly after the attack claiming responsibility and warning the Americans to call off the hunt "if you want their safety." But the military insisted the search would continue. "We are further analyzing the video, however it doesn&#039;t appear to contain any definitive evidence indicating the status of our missing soldiers," Bergner said. Jon Alterman, the Middle East program director for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, agreed the video was not definitive and said the insurgents could have many reasons for releasing it regardless of the soldiers&#039; status.

But it turns out that New Hampshire actually had three small earthquakes over the weekend. The tremors caused no damage or injuries. The state Emergency Management Agency said the quakes were felt Saturday night and Sunday afternoon in the Portsmouth-Exeter area of the northeastern U.S. state. The U.S. Geological Survey listed two of the quakes as magnitudes 1.4 and 1.9. A magnitude for the third quake was not available. Initially, officials investigated whether the sounds and tremors were caused by underground methane gas explosions, and the naturally occurring gas was found escaping from the ground in Portsmouth on Saturday.

He said the methane gas discovery was either a coincidence or a result of the tremors. New Hampshire experiences an average of three to four earthquakes per year, most of them so minor they are not even felt, said Jim Van Dongen, spokesman for the state Office of Emergency Management.

http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/06/04/ap3786055.html&cid Group Denies Link to NYC Terror Plot - Forbes.com Group Denies Link to NYC Terror Plot 06.04.07, 3:15 PM ET The leader of a radical Trinidadian Muslim group denied Monday that his organization had any connection to four men accused of planning to attack New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Yasin Abu Bakr, the leader of Jamaat al Muslimeen, told The Associated Press he knew "nothing" about the alleged plan to bomb a fuel pipeline feeding the airport, a plot authorities say was hatched by a group that included a former Guyanese politician. U.S. authorities claim the alleged plotters sought support in Trinidad from Jamaat al Muslimeen, which staged a deadly coup attempt in the Caribbean nation in 1990. The men did not receive such support, according to court documents. But the documents also say that Abdel Nur, a Guyanese suspect thought to be still at large in Trinidad, said he met in May with Abu Bakr at his compound in Trinidad and the Islamic leader suggested that he return later with others involved "to discuss the plan in detail." Nur allegedly said the Jamaat al Muslimeen leader also wanted to do further checks on Russell Defreitas, the 63-year-old accused mastermind of the plot, and an unidentified confidential informant who had infiltrated the group, the documents said. Abu Bakr declined to say if he knew the men, but also denied any involvement. "I know nothing about these men, and I have nothing to do with whatever they are being charged for," he said in his first public comments since U.S. authorities disclosed the plot on Saturday. Two of the suspects - Abdul Kadir, a former member of Guyana's parliament, and Kareem Ibrahim of Trinidad - are in custody in Trinidad. Nur was being sought by Trinidadian authorities. Defreitas, a U.S. citizen native to Guyana and former JFK air cargo employee, was jailed in the United States. Abu Bakr's group, often accused of aiming to create an Islamic state in Trinidad, describes itself simply as a religious organization. The group stormed Parliament and took the prime minister and his Cabinet hostage in a 1990 rebellion that left 24 dead - the only Islamic revolt in the Western Hemisphere. The rebels eventually surrendered and were later pardoned. It is not known to have international reach, although a member was convicted of trying to smuggle 70 assault rifles to Trinidad from Florida in 2005. Abu Bakr faces charges stemming from a 2005 sermon in which he called for war against rich Muslims who refuse to pay zakaat, an Islamic tithe used to alleviate poverty. The following week, he was arrested by police who razed the group's compound and charged him with sedition and incitement to violence. "You know why they are linking me with this so-called plot is to bias the minds of jurors who will be sitting in my case," he said. Separately, a lawyer for the two men held in Trinidad said they would fight extradition to the United States. Ibrahim and Kadir made their initial court appearance Monday for extradition on one count each of conspiracy to commit a terrorist act against the U.S. government. "We will be opposing extradition," said Rajid Persad, a lawyer who represents both men. The judge set another hearing for June 11 to consider bail and scheduled an extradition hearing for Aug. 2. Farid Scoon, another lawyer for the men, said they intend to seek bail. The extradition fight could be a drawn-out affair. Ibrahim and Kadir could appeal all the way to the Privy Council in Britain, the highest court of appeal for the former British territory. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

http://newspostindia.com/report-2264&cid India-Brazil Ties Acquire Economic Energy (NIGHTLEAD) Online Edition - New Delhi, India - Monday 04th of June 2007 India-Brazil Ties Acquire Economic Energy (NIGHTLEAD) Monday 04th of June 2007 India and Brazil, despite being continents apart, Monday sought to provide much-needed economic momentum to their strategic ties by resolving to quadruple bilateral trade to $10 billion by 2010 and agreeing to cooperate in peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The two emerging giants of Asia and Latin America also signed seven pacts in areas ranging from space and education to oil exploration and media and underlined the increasing congruence of interests on global issues like the UN reforms, WTO trade negotiations and climate change. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva held talks on a broad spectrum of bilateral, regional and global issues that aimed at providing a &#039;solid economic underpinning&#039; to their strategic ties. &#039;The leaders of both countries underlined the importance of providing the strategic partnership with a solid economic underpinning,&#039; said a joint statement impressively entitled &#039;India-Brazil: Red Fort Declaration 2007&#039; that was issued Monday night after President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam hosted a state banquet for the visiting Brazilian president. The two leaders also resolved to work with renewed vigour to make the UN &#039;more democratic, legitimate and representative&#039; and reiterated their support for each other country&#039;s place in an expanded Security Council. The new synergy between the two trillion-dollar economies was epitomized by the launch of the CEOs forum comprising top corporate honchos of the two countries. Indian steel magnate Ratan Tata and Petrobras CEO Jose Sergio Gabrielli, the two chairs of the forum, signed a memorandum of understanding on establishing the CEOs forum in the presence of Manmohan Singh and Lula. In a sign of new strategic equations between the two countries, Lula appreciated India&#039;s growing energy needs driven by its rapidly expanding economy and indicated his country&#039;s readiness to back India in the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) of which Brazil is an influential member. Lula, however, stopped short of offering explicit support to India in the NSG, saying his country would take a formal position on the issue after New Delhi signs a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and concludes a bilateral civil nuclear pact with Washington, official sources told IANS. The Red Fort Declaration speaks about &#039;early development of a programme of cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy consistent with their international obligations&#039;. &#039;Brazil&#039;s response was positive on civil nuclear cooperation. All issues were discussed in a cordial and constructive atmosphere,&#039; an official source said. Lula, who began his three-day state visit to India Sunday - his second in three years - vigorously pitched for providing a new economic impetus to ties between the two countries which he said were emerging as &#039;key players in the international scene&#039;. In a stirring speech in the afternoon to business leaders of both countries, Lula defied sceptics who point to huge distances between the two countries and asserted that the two economies can even exceed the 2010 target of $10 billion with a more proactive participation of the private sector. &#039;It&#039;s time to consolidate our strategic partnership. The 21st century will be the century of opportunity for India and Brazil,&#039; Lula said to resounding applause from the audience. The two leaders also underlined &#039;the importance of simultaneously developing greater connectivity between the two countries and investment in each other&#039;s economies, especially in the infrastructure sector&#039;, the Red Fort Declaration said. Lula also focused on enhanced partnership with India in promoting bio-fuels, an area in which Brazil is an acknowledged leader, as an international commodity. Energy emerged as another important area of collaboration with the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) and ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL) and Petrobras, Brazil&#039;s energy giant. Four agreements were signed in the field of audio-visual co-production, cooperation in augmentation of Brazilian earth station for receiving and processing data from Indian remote sensing satellites mutual assistance in customs matters and on promoting an academic exchange programme between the two countries. An MoU between the National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) of India and the Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA) of Brazil was also signed. In a hectic day packed with focused diplomacy, the 62-year-old Lula, the first Left-wing of Brazil leader to occupy the highest office in his country, also met External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, the chairperson of the ruling coalition Sonia Gandhi and Leader of Opposition L.K. Advani and discussed with them an array of bilateral and global issues. It wasn&#039;t just business and diplomacy all the way for Lula. In a special gesture of appreciation for his advocacy of the rights of the poor and the disempowered, President Kalam presented the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding to Lula at an elegant function at the Hotel Taj Mahal, which was also attended by Manmohan Singh and senior ministers of his government.

The 62-page document, published by China's National Development and Reform Commission , can be read in English in pdf form The main points in the plan, as summarised by officials at the launch, are as follows: China promises to make "significant achievements in controlling greenhouse gas emissions", which are a "major global issue". The country will not impose carbon dioxide emission caps, which would hurt a developing nation trying to eradicate poverty. Wealthy powers produce most greenhouse gases following 200 years of industrialisation so should fund clean development rather than forcing poor countries to accept emission limits. Rich nations have shifted manufacturing to poor nations then blamed them for rising pollution. China subscribes to the UN framework convention on climate change, which says that nations have "common but differentiated responsibilities" to address global warming. China will also fulfil its commitments under the Kyoto protocol. With its "scientific approach" to sustainable economic development, China will take the R&D of renewable energies to a "new level". Currently, China is around 10% less energy efficient that developed countries, which must do more to share knowledge of clean technologies. China will introduce new efficiency legislation and preferential policies for energy saving products. It will consider changes in tax policies - for instance, to boost use of environmentally friendly vehicles - and phase out the production of energy-intensive cars. China will seek to improve its agricultural infrastructure, including promoting the use of low-emission and high-yield rice varieties. "Backward" farm machinery will be phased out and agricultural legislation tightened up. The country will increase tree planting and improve water resource management. It will seek to raise forest cover to 20%, although desertification makes reforestation difficult. Past tree-planting schemes have increased the proportion of forest cover grow from 14% of the country in the early 1990s to 18% in 2005. The threats which China sees from global warming in coming decades include intensified droughts and floods and unpredictable rainfall. It will put anti-flood engineering systems will be put in place in large rivers. Rising sea levels, increased melting of glaciers in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and the Tianshan Mountains and declines in grain yields also threaten. A plan to extend mangroves as flood buffers will be completed. If adaptive steps are not taken, global warming could cut nationwide crop production by up to 10 % by 2030. China will continue to work towards the previously announced government goal of improving overall energy efficiency by 2010 by 20% compared with the 2005 level. China has a relatively low per capita emissions rate. An estimate of the country's 2004 carbon emission levels is around 6.1bn tonnes - about one-fifth of US per capita levels for the same year and just over one-third that of Europe. Family planning policies have helped mitigate climate change. China has already started developing renewable energies including hydropower, biomass, solar, geothermal and wind power in rural areas. These will be expanded. In 2005, renewable energies accounted for 7.5% of China's total energy consumption that year. More than 60 wind farms have been built and connected to the national grid. With a coal-dominated energy mix, China has a "relatively low capacity" to tackle climate change and will surely face more "severe challenges" when coping with it at the same time as "urbanisation, industrialisation and increasing residential energy consumption". China will support nuclear power plant construction and faster exploitation of coal bed methane. The share of coal in the country's energy mix has fallen from 76% in 1990 to 69% in 2005. China's reliance on coal will "not change substantially" in the long term but it will endeavour to develop technologies to utilise coal more efficiently. China will strive to build a "resource conservative and environmentally friendly society" and "vigorously engage" in cooperating with the international community on implementing its climate change plan. Efforts will be made to raise public awareness of climate change "remarkably". An official bilingual on climate change has already been established. It will integrate climate change policy with social policy. China will promote commercial and residential energy conservation, including encouraging the development of green building design. The country will create of a National Leading Group to Address Climate Change, headed by Wen Jiabo, premier of the state council of China. George Bush's recent proposals on global warming are positive, but there should be a single, cohesive global approach to the problem.

Suspected members of a militant Islamic group fired a rocket-propelled-grenade at a Lebanese army checkpoint Sunday near a Palestinian refugee camp close to this southern city, wounding at least five people, security officials said.(AP Photo/Mohammed Zaatari) By AHMED MANTASH Associated Press Writer SIDON, Lebanon Jun 4, 2007 (AP) Bomb explosions and machine gunfire rocked a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon Monday after clashes between Lebanese troops and Islamic militants killed two Lebanese soldiers and wounded three, police said. The fighting began with militants from the group Jund al-Sham firing rocket-propelled grenades and automatic rifle fire on Lebanese troops stationed outside the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp. The clashes in southern Lebanon came as Lebanese troops pressed ahead with an offensive against another militant group, Fatah Islam, in another refugee camp, Nahr el-Bared, located in the northern part of the country. Fierce fighting has engulfed the outskirts of the Nahr el-Bared camp since Friday, when the Lebanese army using tanks and artillery launched an offensive to drive the Fatah Islam militants from their positions inside the settlement. But they have faced strong resistance, and the relentless bombardments have threatened to anger Palestinians in the country's other 11 refugee camps, possibly causing violence to spread among hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living in Lebanon. Armed groups, including Islamic militants, operate with near complete freedom in the camps. The fighting had erupted on and off since late Sunday at Ein el-Hilweh, Lebanon's largest refugee camp in this southern provincial capital, with clashes renewing Monday morning. Lebanese troops returned fire during the nighttime exchanges on the edge of the camp. There was no official word on militant casualties from the fighting, which sent dozens of families from the camp a small town of winding, narrow streets with its own schools, clinics and markets fleeing to Sidon. At Nahr el-Bared, Fatah Islam spokesman Abu Salim Taha told The Associated Press by phone Sunday that five militants, including a senior leader, had been killed and seven wounded since Friday. Also Sunday, a senior Lebanese army officer said that nine Lebanese troops had been killed in the fighting at the camp since Friday, raising the army's death toll to 44 since the standoff there began two weeks ago. 2 Lebanese Soldiers Killed in Fighting Comment on This Story WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts.

"Charges are dismissed without prejudice,'' Colonel Peter Brownback said. Congress created the military tribunals to try only so-called "unlawful'' enemy combatants. The military panel that ruled on Mr. Khadr's status designated him only as an "enemy combatant'' in 2004. Mr. Khadr showed no emotion when the ruling was announced. It was not clear that he understood the ruling. He was quickly hustled out of court. The judge ruled that his court had no jurisdiction because Congress created the tribunals to deal only with "unlawful enemy combatants.'' Charges were dismissed Monday against Omar Khadr, a Canadian citizen held by the Americans at Guantanamo Bay, since he was 15. Former Khadr lawyer on CTV Lawyer Muneer Ahmad appears on CTV Zaynab Khadr, sister of Omar Khadr, speaks with CTV Khadr appears at U.S. military court Khadr murder trial may begin today Whether Monday's legal bombshell really means that Mr. Khadr faces no charges and might perhaps even be released, or whether the government will find a way to recharge him remains unclear. At very least it is a huge embarrassment and perhaps a fatal legal setback for the Bush administration, which created the military tribunals system to try alleged foreign terrorists. Deputy Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said the government should actively take up his case, which he said appears to be in "legal limbo". "Whatever we may think about Mr. Khadr and his past, he is a Canadian citizen with the rights of a Canadian citizen and the Government should take up his case actively with U.S. authorities," Mr. Ignatieff said on Monday afternoon. Mr. Ignatieff said the Government should also "be aware" of the case of David Hicks, a 31-year-old Australian man who spent five years in Guantanamo Bay before pleading guilty to providing material support for terrorism and striking a plea-bargain to serve the rest of his sentence in Australia. New Democrat Justice Critic Joe Comartin backed the call, saying this was "an opportune time" for Canada to step in and have Mr. Khadr serve any sentence within Canada. "This individual was 15 years of age when the alleged crime took place. He was by all intents and purposes from what we understand a child soldier," Mr. Comartin said. "If he was convicted of [killing American soldiers], we obviously have to make an assessment. But he is our citizen. We are responsible for him and we should take that responsibility on. To slough it off onto some other country is not fair." In Mr. Khadr's case, the "unlawful'' element of the enemy combatant designation is crucial. For instance, throwing a grenade &#151; as Mr. Khadr is alleged to have done at the end of a firefight in Afghanistan in 2002 &#151; would be a legal act by a lawful enemy combatant. Only if Mr. Khadr were an "unlawful'' combatant could such an act be a war crime or murder. Mr. Khadr will not be released because of Monday's ruling &#151; the Bush administration has already said that he might be held as a prisoner until the end of hostilities in the so-called war on international terrorism. The jurisdictional issue may, however, affect hundreds of detainees. None of those who have been through the combatant status panel process have been deemed "unlawful'' enemy combatants. Wearing drab prison garb and flip-black flops during the two brief sessions, Mr. Khadr refused to stand as his hearing began &#151; signalling disdain for the U.S. military tribunal that was intended to try him on murder and terrorist charges. Mr. Khadr, now 20 and with a full beard and unruly hair, said nothing during the two sessions. The ramifications for him and hundreds of other detainees at prisons at this U.S. naval station in Cuba remain unclear. He has spent more than five years in prison &#151; most of it in solitary confinement at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba &#151; and has gone through one previous false start that scrubbed when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the military tribunals process as unjust. Remember that they've said that they could hold him... Alberto Bayo, because he is Canadian and Canada was... hahaha...John Lord - that is funny....he is likely... Sadly it doesn't matter if the charges were thrown...

Join the conversation in Talk of the Day A twin-engine plane with three people on board lost power and slammed into homes in Upland while trying to land, authorities said. The pilot and two passengers suffered minor injuries. No one on the ground was hurt, said Ian Gregor, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. The plane came to rest atop a garage without catching a fire. Its wing rested on the roof of another home. The Piper Seneca was approaching Cable Airport when it lost power and crashed into three homes on Blossom Circle. The plane departed from Van Nuys Airport in the San Fernando Valley. Upland is about 72 miles from Palm Springs. “They were on approach when the pilot reported engine problems,” Gregor said. Weather didn’t appear to be a factor. It was sunny with no clouds or fog. Upland is about 45 miles east of Los Angeles, near the junction of Interstates 10 and 15, in San Bernardino County. Cable Airport, described as “The World’s Largest Family-Owned, Public-Use Airport” on its Web site, occupies 105 acres and is home to more than 450 aircraft. It opened as Cable-Claremont Airport in 1946 and is operated by the Cable family. Housing tracts surround the small airport. A plane crashed into a home in nearby Claremont on Dec. 14, 2003, killing the pilot. Federal safety investigators concluded last week that pilot Steven Kaplan, 45, became disoriented and lost control of his Cessna while approaching the airport.

In a transcript released yesterday, Putin acknowledged Russia's response risked reviving an arms race in Europe but said Moscow would not be responsible for the consequences because Washington had started the escalation. Putin made the tough statement before what is likely to be a frosty Group of Eight summit in Germany this week where, with other world leaders, he will come face to face with U.S. President George W. Bush. Russia has not specifically targeted its missiles at Europe since the end of the Cold War but, asked if it might return to that if the U.S. missile shield plan went ahead, Putin said: &#34;Of course, we are returning to those times. &#34;It is clear that if a part of the U.S. nuclear capability turns up in Europe, and, in the opinion of our military specialists, will threaten us, then we are forced to take corresponding steps in response.&#34; Putin's warning that missiles might once again be pointed at European targets carries a clear political message but has few practical implications. Even after the Cold War ended, Russia retained the capability to hit European and U.S. targets. Training ballistic missiles on a particular target is a fairly simple technical task that can be done in a matter of minutes. Putin's remarks came in comments to various reporters from G-8 countries on Friday. The Kremlin released a transcript on its website Russia's response to the U.S. missile moves would be to develop &#34;more effective offensive systems,&#34; Putin said. &#34;We know that that risks restarting an arms race, for which we will not be responsible. It was not us who started altering the strategic balance.&#34; The U.S. wants to locate elements of its shield &ndash; including a radar station and interceptor missiles &ndash; in Poland and the Czech Republic. It says the shield is not a threat to Russia but is designed to protect against possible missile attacks from what it calls &#34;rogue states&#34; such as Iran and North Korea. Putin said that was not credible. &#34;There are no Iranian missiles with the necessary range,&#34; he said. &#34;So it becomes obvious that this innovation is about us Russians.&#34; In other remarks, Putin said British demands for extradition of Andrei Lugovoi, suspected in the murder of Russian ex-agent Alexander Litvinenko, are &#34;foolishness.&#34; &#34;If the people who sent us this demand do not know that by Russian constitution Russian citizens cannot be extradited to foreign states, then their competence is in question,&#34; he said. Putin also suggested Russia's four-year presidential terms should be extended. &#34;Four years for Russia was a copy of U.S. rules. ... Maybe it should be five or seven, but four years is of course a fairly short term.&#34; Horse, heiress and a hurdle Charities worthy of donations Great home delivery subscription deals here!

Meanwhile, the top Palestinian leadership in Lebanon says it cannot guarantee it can control the reaction of the more than 400,000 Palestinians living in the 12 official refugee camps throughout the country if the Lebanese army's all-out assault on the besieged Nahr al-Bared refugee camp in the north causes a heavy civilian death toll. At the Fatah headquarters in the nearby Baddawi Palestinian refugee camp, Hajj Rif'at, media director for the mainstream Fatah organisation and a spokesperson for the multi-party Palestinian Liberation Organisation, told IPS, "If the army invades [Nahr al-Bared], I think that there will be many more Palestinian victims from within the camp, and we refuse that the solution be at the expense of our children and women and the destruction of our camp." What began in May as a security incident with bank robbers in the northern Lebanon coastal city of Tripoli has turned into a prolonged military confrontation with a Sunni Islamist group, Fatah al-Islam, that had taken root in Nahr al-Bared in the months directly after the 34-day war with Israel that began Jul. 12, 2006. For two weeks, the Lebanese army has traded heavy gunfire with members of the group. Sources on the ground say that the army has also sent thousands of 155-millimetre tank shells and mortar rounds, into the refugee camp, to suppress any movement from the fighters of Fatah al-Islam. The fighting intensified over the weekend as the Lebanese military sent in a newly acquired helicopter gunship to blast the upper floors of buildings used by Fatah al-Islam snipers. Observers say that the Lebanese army also captured strategic parts of Fatah al Islam's defensive positions that had been established on the outer rims of the Nahr al-Bared camp. The Lebanese army claims to have killed dozens of Fatah al Islam fighters over the last three days. Sources confirm that at least 12 Lebanese soldiers were killed and 10 wounded in the fighting over the weekend. Thus far, 40 army soldiers have been killed since fighting began on May 20. The pro-Western government has vowed to defeat the militants at all cost, and analysts say that any room for negotiating with the Sunni Islamist group was lost after the first week of fighting. Indeed, Fatah al Islam's leadership has reiterated their willingness to fight to the last man, refusing to surrender or give up their arms at this stage. "We cannot afford to bargain. We cannot compromise on the issue of terrorism," Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said late this week. These tactics have caused a humanitarian crisis for the approximately 10,000 Palestinians still trapped in the Nahr al-Bared camp. Information coming from the camp is limited. Residents who have been able to make phone calls from within the camp say that the Lebanese army has continued to pound the camp's interior with artillery fire where most of the civilians are now located. This despite Lebanese government statements that all efforts would be made to spare civilians in their effort to crush Fatah al-Islam. The Palestinian Red Crescent said at least 25 civilians have been killed in Nahr al-Bared since the Lebanese army surrounded the camp two weeks ago. According to Mahmoud Rashid, an official at the Saffad Hospital in the Baddawi Camp, most if not all of the civilian deaths that have been recorded have come from the army shelling, and the number of dead is likely to rise significantly because there is no medicine in the camp to treat the wounded. The International Committee for the Red Cross delivered 23 tonnes of food and nearly 60,000 litres of water on Tuesday and Wednesday last week, providing the first significant aid relief to the remaining Palestinians in the Nahr al-Bared camp who have been without electricity, food or water since the fighting began. Abbas Zaki, the top PLO representative in Lebanon, said in a television interview on Wednesday, "There are corpses rotting in the streets." More than half of the estimated 35,000 residents of Nahr al-Bared have fled the fighting to the 11 other official Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. At the Baddawi Palestinian refugee camp five kilometres from the northern coast city of Tripoli, more than 20,000 civilians have sought refuge in the last 13 days, doubling the camp's size and overburdening its social services. As the fighting continues around Nahr al-Bared, the anger on Baddawi's streets is palpable. Khaled Yamani, an official with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Lebanon said, "Putting aside the issue of Fatah al-Islam and other similar groups, the anger is brewing amongst the Palestinians because it is their people who are being killed, and it's not being taken into consideration, and this anger may even manifest itself outside the bounds of official Palestinian structures." Palestinians took to the streets over the weekend to protest the Lebanese army's attacks on civilians trapped in Nahr al-Bared. Residents of the Bourj al-Barajneh camp in Beirut joined displaced families from Nahr al-Bared for a protest in front of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's medical centre there on Friday, and hundreds of Palestinians gathered near a Lebanese army outpost in the Rashidiyeh refugee camp in south Lebanon demanding an immediate cease-fire and end to "random" attacks on civilians. "When will we be allowed to return to our homes? Is this a permanent resettlement?" Abu Ali, a father of seven, asked Thursday from an Internet café in the Baddawi camp. He and his entire family fled Nahr al-Bared to Baddawi on the third day of fighting. In the course of several interviews, displaced families in the Baddawi camp were equating their flight from Nahr al-Bared to what Palestinians call Nakba, or the "cataclysm", referring to the flight of some 700,000 Palestinians that coincided with the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. Although Prime Minister Siniora has pledged to rebuild what has been destroyed by the Lebanese army over the last two weeks in the battle against Fatah al-Islam, few of the displaced in the Baddawi camp have put much stock in his statements. Siniora's pro-Western government has been locked in a protracted political battle with Hezbollah, a Shi'a organisation, and its allies since last year's war with Israel. Reconstruction efforts needed after Israel's military destruction of villages in south Lebanon have yet to begin, and are not expected to until the ongoing political crisis with Hezbollah reaches some sort of resolution. This past weekend, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah condemned Siniora's government for bringing in military aid from the United States and their Arab allies. On Sunday, he said such assistance could provoke al-Qaeda style movements to begin fighting in Lebanon as they have done in Iraq. On Sunday and Monday, the conflict heated up in southern Lebanon when another Sunni Islamic group, Jund al Sham, attacked Lebanese army positions outside Ain al-Hilweh camp. Three Lebanese soldiers were killed, and although Palestinian groups in the camp have moved to contain this small Islamist movement from inflaming the situation, Lebanese army sources say the fighting continues. Meanwhile, Palestinians in the camps in Lebanon are gathered around their television sets, or keeping close watch on news through their mobile phones and at Internet cafes, waiting to see what the body count will be for those civilians trapped inside the Nahr al-Bared camp. That information might be slow in coming, as the Lebanese government has prevented journalists and humanitarian organisations from entering areas in and around the camp. ***** (END/2007) Send your comments to the editor LEBANON: 30,000 Caught in Crossfire LEBANON: Violence Highlights Regional Polarisation Holy Land/Unholy War - More IPS News POLITICS-US: Arab, Jewish Communities Share Peace Goals RIGHTS-COLOMBIA: 'You Can't Stop Thinking About Their Agony' POLITICS- ST LUCIA: How Ill Is the Prime Minister?

http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2007/06/04/khadr-charges.html%3Fref%3Drss&cid Guantanamo judge drops charges against Khadr Guantanamo judge drops charges against Khadr Last Updated: Monday, June 4, 2007 | 4:35 PM ET An American military judge abruptly dropped all charges on Monday against Omar Khadr, although it's unlikely to mean freedom for the only Canadian at the U.S. Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba. The 20-year-old from the Toronto area, who had been facing charges of murder and terrorism, appeared before aÂ military commission in Guantanamo, where he was expected to be arraigned. In this courtroom sketch, Omar Khadr, far left, sits beside three lawyers at the military commission at Guantanamo U.S. Naval Base on Monday. Instead, the judge, army Col. Peter Brownback, dismissed the charges for technical reasons. "We're very happy about it," Khadr's sister, Zaynab, told CBC News in Toronto. "We're surprised." Under the Military Commissions Act that wasÂ revised and passed by the U.S. Congress in October 2006, military commissions only have jurisdiction to try "unlawful enemy combatants." However, Khadr was classified by a military panel in 2004Â as only anÂ "enemy combatant" â€” which is what led the judge to dismiss the charges on Monday. CBC News's Bill Gillespie, reporting from Guantanamo, said Khadr's classification as an enemy combatant means he was fighting on the battlefield, but not necessarily acting unlawfully. Khadr was 15 when he was captured in Afghanistan in 2002 and imprisoned in Guantanamo. He was accused of throwing a grenade that killed American medic Sgt. First Class Christopher J. Speer. The U.S. Defence Department said Monday that there would be an appeal of the judge's decision within 72 hours. Khadr will either be re-arraigned or willÂ have his status reviewed by a military tribunal, the Pentagon said. "There are more questions than answers at this point," Cmdr. J.D. Gordon, a spokesman forÂ the Pentagon,Â told CBC News. Gordon said KhadrÂ will not be returning to Canada any time soon, but Khadr's sister said she is still holding out hope her brother will be released. "I don't know what to expect, I'm just hoping better news comes along soon," she said. "I hope my brother can come home." She said she hasn't been allowed to speak to her brother since March, but knows he's coping with injuries to his eyes and knees, as well as mental anguish from being imprisoned for so long, at such a young age. Khadr was shot during his arrest. "I'm hoping he's hanging in there," Zaynab said.Â "I know his health isn't very good." WhenÂ Khadr appeared in court on Monday, he seemed defiant at first, Gillespie reported, noting that Khadr refused to stand when the judge entered the court. However, after the ruling was handed down, Khadr appeared more chatty and relaxed. Khadr was wearing a prison uniform and sporting a full, bushy beard. Gillespie noted he looked much older than he did when he last appeared before the commission more than a year ago, wearingÂ a RootsÂ sweatshirt, his beard neatly trimmed. Time for Ottawa to intervene: Amnesty Alex Neve, the secretary general of Amnesty International Canada,Â said the Canadian government should act swiftly, and demand the U.S. return Khadr to Canada. Neve said Khadr could be tried under the Canadian court system, provided there was appropriate evidence to justify charges. "It's certainly vital that the Canadian government intervene forcefully now,"Â he told CBC News. "It's been a very dismal reaction to date from the Canadian government on this case." Neve also pointed out thatÂ Ottawa can no longer justify inaction by arguing that theÂ case is beforeÂ a U.S. court and can't be meddled with. "They should be intervening directly with U.S. officials because it is now back in the hands of the U.S. government to decide what to do with this case,"Â Neve said. Canada's Foreign Affairs Department would not comment on Khadr's case on Monday, but said it is reviewing the situation. Ruling could jeopardize Guantanamo trial system Col. Dwight Sullivan, theÂ chief of U.S. defenceÂ lawyers at Guantanamo, saidÂ Monday's ruling could jeopardize the revised military commission system set up byÂ Congress andÂ U.S. President George W. Bush. The revisions cameÂ after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2006 thatÂ the previous Guantanamo trial system was illegal. None of the roughly 380 detainees at Guantanamo have been classified as "unlawful" enemy combatants. "The experience of the military commission system demonstrates that it's a failure," Sullivan told CBC News. "Rather than trying to revive these charges, it seems time for the United States to take a new look and find a new way to deal with these cases." He suggested using the U.S. federal court system would be a preferable alternative. Khadr is one of only three Guantanamo prisoners who faced charges under the new system. David Hicks pleaded guilty in March to providing material support to al-Qaeda. He was released from GuantanamoÂ and is serving out his nine-month sentence in his native Australia.Â  Salim Ahmed Hamdan of Yemen is currently having his case heard in Guantanamo. Hamdan, charged with conspiring to harm U.S. citizens, has admitted to being a driver for al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden but denied taking part in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks against the United States. The prisoners who haven't been charged are being held at the U.S. naval prison on suspicion of having links to the Taliban and al-Qaeda.

One station, Kalleone FM, said 22 people died, including a pilot who jumped from the helicopter as it crashed at the airport. A witness at the airport, who asked not to be identified, confirmed the crash and said its two pilots both jumped out. One survived and was hospitalized. The witness said the helicopter burst into flames upon crashing. It was destroyed before airport firefighters could put out the flames. Helicopters and a sea ferry are the only ways to get to the airport, located across a bay from the capital, Freetown, which is on the Atlantic Ocean. In 2001, a U.N. helicopter traveling from U.N. headquarters in Sierra Leone to the airport crashed into the bay, killing all seven aboard. The U.N. said at the time a mechanical problem appeared to have been the cause. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Ibrahim and Guyanan Abdul Kadir, who are in custody of Trinidadian authorities, are suspects in a plot to blow up a fuel line that feeds New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. (AP Photo/Andres Leighton) PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad -- The leader of a radical Trinidadian Muslim group denied Monday that his organization had any connection to four men accused of planning to attack New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Yasin Abu Bakr, the leader of Jamaat al Muslimeen, told The Associated Press he knew "nothing" about the alleged plan to bomb a fuel pipeline feeding the airport, a plot authorities say was hatched by a group that included a former Guyanese politician. U.S. authorities claim the alleged plotters sought support in Trinidad from Jamaat al Muslimeen, which staged a deadly coup attempt in the Caribbean nation in 1990. The men did not receive such support, according to court documents. But the documents also say that Abdel Nur, a Guyanese suspect thought to be still at large in Trinidad, said he met in May with Abu Bakr at his compound in Trinidad and the Islamic leader suggested that he return later with others involved "to discuss the plan in detail." Nur allegedly said the Jamaat al Muslimeen leader also wanted to do further checks on Russell Defreitas, the 63-year-old accused mastermind of the plot, and an unidentified confidential informant who had infiltrated the group, the documents said. Abu Bakr declined to say if he knew the men, but also denied any involvement. "I know nothing about these men, and I have nothing to do with whatever they are being charged for," he said in his first public comments since U.S. authorities disclosed the plot on Saturday. Two of the suspects - Abdul Kadir, a former member of Guyana's parliament, and Kareem Ibrahim of Trinidad - are in custody in Trinidad. Nur was being sought by Trinidadian authorities. Defreitas, a U.S. citizen native to Guyana and former JFK air cargo employee, was jailed in the United States. Abu Bakr's group, often accused of aiming to create an Islamic state in Trinidad, describes itself simply as a religious organization. The group stormed Parliament and took the prime minister and his Cabinet hostage in a 1990 rebellion that left 24 dead - the only Islamic revolt in the Western Hemisphere. The rebels eventually surrendered and were later pardoned. It is not known to have international reach, although a member was convicted of trying to smuggle 70 assault rifles to Trinidad from Florida in 2005. Abu Bakr faces charges stemming from a 2005 sermon in which he called for war against rich Muslims who refuse to pay zakaat, an Islamic tithe used to alleviate poverty. The following week, he was arrested by police who razed the group's compound and charged him with sedition and incitement to violence. "You know why they are linking me with this so-called plot is to bias the minds of jurors who will be sitting in my case," he said. Separately, a lawyer for the two men held in Trinidad said they would fight extradition to the United States. Ibrahim and Kadir made their initial court appearance Monday for extradition on one count each of conspiracy to commit a terrorist act against the U.S. government. "We will be opposing extradition," said Rajid Persad, a lawyer who represents both men. The judge set another hearing for June 11 to consider bail and scheduled an extradition hearing for Aug. 2. Farid Scoon, another lawyer for the men, said they intend to seek bail. The extradition fight could be a drawn-out affair. Ibrahim and Kadir could appeal all the way to the Privy Council in Britain, the highest court of appeal for the former British territory.

Army Col. Peter Brownback's decision at the island detention facility temporarily ended the case against Omar Khadr, a 20-year-old detainee who allegedly killed a U.S. serviceman during intense fighting in in July 2002. Khadr, who the military has determined is an "enemy combatant," was scheduled for arraignment today in what was to be the second case to go before a military commission. This is a photo of Omar Khadr, taken before he was imprisoned, handed out by his mother Maha Khadr following a news conference in Toronto on Feb. 9, 2005. A military judge on Monday dismissed charges against Canadian detainee Omar Khadr, saying the matter is outside the jurisdiction of the new military tribunal system. The dismissal of the charges does not mean he will be freed from Guantanamo. (AP Photo/Family Handout via Canadian Press) The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article But Brownback decided that the Military Commissions Act of 2006 -- which sets forth the rules for trying detainees at Guantanamo -- limits such commissions to "unlawful enemy combatants" and concluded that the military has never classified Khadr using the term "unlawful." A military review panel decided in September 2004 that Khadr was an "enemy combatant" but did not make any distinction between whether he was a lawful or unlawful combatant. The law, as written, prohibits lawful combatants from trial before military commissions and Brownback ruled that that distinction is vitally important. So-called Combatant Status Review Tribunals examined the cases of 558 detainees held at Guantanamo between August, 2004 and March 2005, concluding in 520 cases that the detainees were "enemy combatants," according to the Defense Department. The tribunals had only two choices: to label the detainees "enemy combatants" or "no longer enemy combatants." The law written in October apparently did not mesh with the military's wording. Pentagon officials immediately dismissed the matter as a legal technicality that can be corrected, but the ruling could put a hold on all military commission prosecutions until it is resolved. Military prosecutors planned to appeal the decision to the Court of Military Commissions Review, which will be based at the military commissions offices in Crystal City but has not been constituted yet, officials said this afternoon. Maj. Elizabeth Kubala, a spokesperson for the Office of Military Commissions, said Brownback did not question whether the military commission is the appropriate forum in which to try members of al-Qaeda for alleged war crimes but that the "existing CSRT definition was not identical to the definition" under the Military Commissions Act. Khadr will not be released as a result of the decision and likely will face a new Combatant Status Review Tribunal to determine his status once again. It is possible, officials said, that any detainee scheduled to go before a military commission will be required to go through a revamped status review before he is charged. The decision received praise from human rights groups who argue that the process is fatally flawed and should be scrapped in favor of trying accused detainees in U.S. courts. The current military commissions were devised by Congress last year after the Supreme Court overturned the Bush Administration's first version of the trials. "If the administration had any sense at all, this would be the final, fatal blow to the military commissions process," said Jennifer Daskal, a Human Rights Watch representative who is at Guantanamo to monitor the commissions. Jumana Musa, who is watching the case for Amnesty International, said the ruling is the "most significant setback" since the commissions were revamped. "The judge's decision clearly indicates that a fair trial is not possible within a system that is being developed as it proceeds," Musa said in a statement. "It raises more questions about the Bush administration and Congress' wisdom and logic in rushing to patch together a new system of justice, when there are fully functioning federal courts that can not only offer fair trials but also come with established procedure." Khadr was to be the second detainee to go through a military commission. Australian David Hicks pleaded guilty to charges of aiding terrorists in March and has been returned home to serve out the remaining months of his sentence. Khadr allegedly threw a grenade at U.S. troops during heavy fighting, killing one. He also allegedly conducted surveillance against U.S. convoy movements in Afghanistan in 2002. 2 Gitmo Detainees Appear Before Tribunal Massacre Survivors Sue U.N., Dutch Gov't Srebrenica Survivors Sue U.N., Dutch Silva Proposes Forest Preservation Plan Landslide Damages Famed Valley in Russia Related Topics & Web Content Top 35 Most Viewed Comments that include profanity or personal attacks or other inappropriate comments or material will be removed from the site.

Both men are suspects in an alleged plot to blow up a fuel line feeding New York's JFK Airport. By By Mark Hosenball June 4, 2007 - Two suspects arrested in Trinidad in connection with a purported plot to attack the fuel supply system at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport may have been visiting the Caribbean island nation in an effort to meet with the leader of a notorious and violent militant Islamic gang, NEWSWEEK has learned. Two U.S. law-enforcement officials, who asked for anonymity when discussing a continuing investigation, said there were indications that JFK plot suspects Abdul Kadir, a former member of parliament in Guyana, and Trinidadian citizen Kareem Ibrahim were in Trinidad to try to meet with Yasin Abu Bakr, leader of Jamaat al Muslimeen (JAM), a radical group. In 1990, JAM staged a coup attempt in which the prime minister of Trinidad and other local notables were taken hostage. Abu Bakr is scheduled to go on trial in Trinidad in the near future on terrorism and sedition charges. One of the law-enforcement officials said that three out of four suspects charged in the JFK plotâ€”Kadir, Ibrahim and Abdul Nur, a Guyanan citizen who currently is the target of an international manhuntâ€”were acquaintances of Abu Bakr. Late last month, according to a complaint for arrest made public by the Justice Department over the weekend, two suspects in the JFK plotâ€”Kadir and Russell Defreitas, a former JFK airport employee and U.S. citizen whose arrest over the weekend triggered a media feeding frenzy about the alleged plotâ€”traveled with an undercover FBI informant to Trinidad. (The four suspects have not yet been indicted, and therefore have yet to enter a plea). While there, the complaint says, they visited with Nur at "one of the compounds of the JAM leader." The leader is not named in the U.S. government complaint, but was identified by law-enforcement officials as Abu Bakr. During a conversation recorded at the behest of U.S. investigators, Nur told Defreitas and the undercover informant that he (Nur) had met with the JAM leader about the suspects' alleged scheme to blow up a pipeline carrying fuel from New Jersey via Staten Island to JFK Airport in Queens, according to the government complaint. The complaint says that during the secretly recorded conversation, Nur said the JAM leader asked the suspects to come back a few days later to discuss their plan in detail. According to the complaint, the JAM leader also indicated to Nur that he wanted to check out Defreitas and the undercover source before any further meetings. It is unclear whether any further meetings with the JAM leader occurred, however. U.S. law-enforcement officials said that while they believe that suspects Nur, Kadir and Ibrahim all had in the past met with Abu Bakr, at this point they have no evidence that Abu Bakr actually agreed at any point to offer his or the JAM's backing, either moral or material, for the JFK pipeline plot. A U.S. counterterrorism official said that some intelligence available to U.S. agencies suggests JAM has had sporadic contact with international Islamic terror groupsâ€”such as Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network and the Lebanese-based, Iranian-supported Shia movement, Hizbullah. However, according to the official, there is little indication that JAM has ever established an "operational" relationship with any international terror organization. JAM became infamous in 1990 for a coup attempt in which Abu Bakr, with more than 100 followers, stormed the Trinidad and Tobago Parliament building and took the prime minister and much of his cabinet hostage. The resulting standoff sparked a wave of rioting in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad's capital, that left many dead and extensive property damage. But Abu Bakr and other hostage takers avoided imprisonment when he and his group were granted amnesty following negotiations that ended the hostage incident, according to a monograph about the group published by the Jamestown Foundation, an antiterrorism think tank based in Washington, D.C. The foundation, and news reports from Trinidad, say that the current terrorism and sedition charges against Abu Bakr relate to a series of bombings in Trinidad two years ago, as well as his role in allegedly ordering the murders of former JAM members who defected from the group. A spokeswoman for the office of Trinidad's attorney general had no immediate comment. U.S. counterterrorism officials say that today they regard Abu Bakr, a 64-year-old former Trinidadian police officer who converted to Islam, and his JAM movement as more of a street gang engaged in organized crime activities like drug trafficking and protection rackets than an international terrorist threat. But the gang's history of violence, apparent access to cash and weaponry and periodic indulgence in militant Islamic rhetoric created concern that the accused JFK plotters were trying to hook up with an organization with genuine potential to cause mayhem. At one point a few days before the feds and Trinidadian authorities swooped in to break up the alleged JFK plot, the U.S. government complaint says Kareem suggested that the plotters should abandon their effort to present the plan for approval to JAM and Abu Bakr. Instead, Kareem said he would seek support for the plan from contacts he had overseas who might be interested in financing it, the complaint said. A U.S. official said that Kareem talked about having such contacts in Britain or Iran. A report by McClatchy newspapers quoted Trinidad's attorney general saying that the reason that authorities moved when they did to arrest the suspects was that Kadir was about to travel from Trinidad via Venezuela to Iran to attend an Islamic conference. For the moment, however, U.S. officials are downplaying any Iranian link to the plotters, saying they have no further indication that it might be significant. U.S. officials also say that while the alleged JFK plot was grandiose in its ambitions, there is little reason to believe the accused plotters had the technical know-how or competence to actually carry it out. The feds say that what the plotters wanted to do was to blow up the entire pipeline from New Jersey to JFK Airport, thereby not only causing massive destruction at the airport itself but also in the neighborhoods through which the pipeline passed. But due to pipeline safety mechanisms and the difficulty of igniting jet fuel, government officials said, it is unlikely this particular group of suspects, based on their apparent level of knowledge, would have been able to cause the huge conflagration the government alleges they hoped to produce. &copy; 2007 Newsweek, Inc. | Capital Sources: The Art of Interrogation Hosenball: The Trinidad Terror Connection Remembering the Dead of Tiananmen Musings on the Democratic Debate Inside the Grisly World of Dog Fighting Authorities suspect 4 in NYC terror plot JFK arrests raise issue of pipeline safetyÂ  'JFK plot' said to highlight shift in threat US authorities say foiled plot to blow up fuel tanks, pipelines at JFK airport Subscribe to Newsweek &#151; Lowest Rate Available Add Newsweek RSS Feeds RIGHTS AND REPRINT SALES ONLINE AND DISTANCE LEARNING DIRECTORY

It is the deadliest internal violence since the 1975-90 civil war. In the latest bloodshed, two Lebanese soldiers and two Islamist extremists from the Jund al-Sham (Soldiers of Damascus) group were killed in overnight clashes near a refugee camp in the southern port city of Sidon, a military spokesperson said. The army retrieved the body of a soldier on Monday from the outskirts of Nahr al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp where he was killed on Friday during clashes with Fatah al-Islam militants holed up inside the shantytown. Forty-five troops and 41 Fatah al-Islam gunmen have been killed since fighting erupted in the northern city of Tripoli and the nearby Nahr al-Bared camp on May 20, sources on both sides said. One Lebanese civilian was killed in the crossfire when troops attacked a building in Tripoli where Fatah al-Islam militants were holed up on May 20, police and hospital sources said. Seventeen Palestinian refugees have also been killed inside Nahr al-Bared where fighting has continued to rage, according to Sultan Abul Aynayn, Lebanon commander of the mainstream Fatah movement of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas. The previous deadliest bout of internal fighting was in January 2000 when 45 people were killed in clashes between the army and Sunni militants from the Takfir wal-Hijra (Excommunication and Flight) group in the Dinnieh area of northern Lebanon. There have been much higher death tolls, however, in a series of Israeli offensives against Lebanon since the civil war.

The video offered no proof for its claims. The clip, which was made available to The Associated Press by the Washington-based SITE Institute, showed confused and jerky night battle scenes, and later offered close-ups of two identification cards. It did not show the soldiers. ''The Americans sent 4,000 soldiers looking for them,'' said an unidentified voice on the video, which featured the logo of the media production house of the Islamic State of Iraq. ''They were alive and then dead.'' The body of one of the soldiers was found in Iraq's Euphrates River, but the other two remain missing. Family friends of the missing men said the U.S. military briefed relatives about the video over the weekend. The video offered no proof for its claims that the soldiers had been killed and buried. The voiceover blamed their deaths on ''the American Army and their leaders, who do not care for the feelings of the soldiers' mothers.'' ''And as you refused to deliver the bodies of our killed people, we will not deliver the bodies of your dead, and their end will be beneath the ground, Allah willing,'' the voice said. A body found May 23 in the Euphrates River was identified by the U.S. military as Pfc. Joseph Anzack Jr., 20, of Torrance, Calif. The missing soldiers have been identified as Spc. Alex R. Jimenez, 25, of Lawrence, Mass., and of Pvt. Byron W. Fouty, 19, of Waterford, Mich. The three vanished after their combat team was ambushed May 12 about 20 miles outside Baghdad. Five others, including an Iraqi, were killed in the ambush, subsequently claimed by al-Qaida. The attack triggered a massive search in the area south of Baghdad known as the ''triangle of death'' for the rampant insurgent activity there. Gordon Dibler, Fouty's stepfather, said he was holding out hope for the soldiers' safe return: ''We're praying, and so far, we don't know for certain that they aren't alive.'' At the end of the 10-minute 41-second video, the identification cards of the two missing soldiers were shown, with the headline: ''Bush is the reason of the loss of your POWs'' written on the screen above the cards. SITE, an organization that monitors terrorist groups, did not say how it obtained the video. A card belonging to Anzack was not shown. Along with the identification cards, the footage also showed credit cards, American and Iraqi money and other personal items that the militants called ''booty.'' There was no immediate word from U.S. officials about the Islamic State of Iraq claim. The video also showed footage, apparently taken before the ambush, of three masked men standing around a stand displaying a sketch of the area, mapping out the attack plan. One of the three men, who were all dressed in black, talked to the camera and pointed to the sketch. Another stood by him carrying a gun. ''I have urged you to bring me American prisoners,'' said the man, whose name was not given but was identified as one of the militant group's leaders. A Islamic Web site that commonly posts videos from militant groups including the Islamic State of Iraq said in a banner headline that it would show the video within hours, but the video has not yet appeared. After the soldiers disappeared, the Islamic State of Iraq issued Web statements warning the Americans to call off the hunt ''if you want their safety.'' Copyright 2007 by The Associated Press.

Attorney Andrew Cohen analyzes legal issues for Former White House official I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby's sentencing brief, the one in which he pleads for leniency and probation for his crimes, reads more like the text of a speech likely to be given at his funeral, years hence, when all the king's horses and all the king's men congregate to see him off for the sweet hereafter. And, as eulogies go, the narrative is quite compelling: Libby was indeed involved in a lot of things, many of them good, in his long career in and out of high-powered politics. Just read the very first lines — the first few words! — from the beginning of the brief and tell me you don't hear Bach playing softly in the background: "Distinguished public servant. Generous mentor. Selfless friend. Devoted father. This is the rich portrait of Mr. Libby that emerges. … His dedication to promoting freedom abroad and keeping American citizens safe at home is beyond question. Mr. Libby has also earned a reputation for treating people fairly and kindly and comforting those who are distressed. He has avoided the Washington limelight to focus on nurturing his young children." And remember, dear friends, there will be a light buffet available following the service. When read today, however, while Libby is still very much alive and kicking on the eve of his sentencing for obstruction of justice and perjury, Libby's pleas read like unintended parody. His lawyers, for example, write earnestly about his "great contributions to the public interest," but we know that the jury convicted Libby of lying to a grand jury and the feds about the disclosure of the name of a covert CIA agent. Libby's attorneys also remind U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton that their client "has demonstrated strong moral character," even though the judge and everyone else now knows precisely how and to what extent Libby tried to use the media to do the White House's dirty work against Valerie Plame Wilson and her husband, Joe Wilson. "Mr. Libby is known for his fairness and generosity," the defense lawyers write, and "for his caring and unselfish nature." They claim that "his concern for the well-being of others extends beyond the boundaries of his community and even the borders of his country." And, they, add, "he treats everyone with respect." Everyone, that is, except evidently grand jurors, federal investigators, CIA agents, journalists and political adversaries of the Bush administration. And on and on it goes, one toast-type moment after another, buttressed by segments of letters of support offered no doubt by some of the most important politicians and statesmen of our time. The defense brief is striking because it does not contain the language of politics, let alone the language of the law. It contains instead this series of pleas, one after another, that you might expect to hear if you happened to arrive at Heaven's Gate while St. Peter was interrogating someone hoping to gain entrance to the Kingdom. I don't blame Libby's lawyers for writing it this way; they figure they are going to go down with their best argument, which is that Libby's extraordinary public service ought to count him when the judge determines his fate. And I also don't blame the defense team for blaming the media and for trying to turn their client himself into a victim of the CIA leak investigation. What else are they going to argue? But special prosecutor Patrick J. Fitzgerald gets it — and so, too, I believe, will Judge Walton. Libby's grand career probably won't help him now that he is a felon; it probably works against him. If Libby had been convicted of grand larceny, or even a violent crime, his lawyers might have been better able to argue to the judge that the misdeeds were an anomaly in an otherwise productive and exemplary life. But Libby, an attorney, was not convicted of some random crime. He was convicted of something that not only goes to the heart of what it means to be a lawyer but what it means to hold high office, too. He was convicted of subverting the very rule of law he was sworn to uphold. Libby's stature in government and the responsibility he was given and for a time deserved, imposed upon him an even greater duty to respect and uphold the law. The long list of credits and credentials his lawyers offer as proof that he deserves leniency prove instead that he should have known better, and done much better, when confronted by the feds and grand jurors. And the glittering resume laid up before the judge begs the central question of the Libby trial: how could such a sharp man suddenly lose his memory about his role in important events that were at the heart of a years-long controversy? It just doesn't add up. That’s why I think Libby get sentenced to prison time when Judge Walton gets the last word. As Fitzgerald pointed out in the government's sentencing brief, Libby could have been an upright guy and told the truth when asked about the Plame leak, he could have even exercised his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. These options might have truly supported the defense claim that Libby is a man of "strong moral character" — but, of course, they would not have helped Libby or his patrons at the White House face the political expediencies of the day. It was easier to use the media to anonymously slime Plame and Wilson and then plead a lack of memory about the shoddy affair when the law came calling. Libby chose a path that is common in politics. There are many other men and women of so-called "strong moral character" working in Washington who are called upon every day to do sleazy things to one another as part of their jobs in and out of government. Sometimes the law catches up with these people; usually it doesn't. But here's hoping anyway that the next honorable man of government convicted of a felony doesn't use the achievements of his high office to excuse or diminish his low work. © MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc.

Momentum building for US immigration overhaul New polls show Americans open to change in law John McCain, in Iowa Friday, planned to give a speech today in Coral Gables, Fla., with a message for his rival candidates. (Charlie Neibergall/associated press) By Jonathan Weisman, Washington Post | WASHINGTON -- After a week at home with their constituents, the Senate architects of a delicate immigration compromise are increasingly convinced they will hold together this week to pass a sweeping overhaul of the nation's immigration laws. Momentum is building behind one unifying theme: Today's immigration system is too broken to go unaddressed. Congress's week long Memorial Day recess was expected to leave the bill in tatters. But with a week of action set to begin today, the legislation's champions say they now believe the voices of opposition, especially from conservatives, represent a small segment of public opinion. Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, who led negotiations on the bill for his party, said the flood of angry calls and protests that greeted the deal two weeks ago has receded every day since then. "You just have to recognize you will get 300 calls, you'll get conflicts at town hall meetings, all of them negative," said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who consulted with Kyl and hopes to carry a similar deal through the House in July. "The last few days have really turned things around." Public opinion polls seem to support Kyl's contention that Americans are far more open to the deal than the voices of opposition would indicate. In a new -ABC News poll, 52 percent said they would support a program giving illegal immigrants the right to stay and work in the United States if they pay a fine and meet other requirements. Opposition to that proposal was 44 percent. As the Senate prepared to resume debate on the issue today, Senator John McCain of Arizona, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, planned to give a speech in Coral Gables, Fla., with a message for his rival candidates: Opposing the immigration bill for political gain will only worsen the problem. "I would hope that any candidate for president would not suggest doing nothing," McCain said in prepared remarks. "And I would hope they wouldn't play politics for their own interests if the cost of their ambition was to make this problem even harder to solve. To want the office so badly that you would intentionally make our country's problems worse might prove you can read a poll or take a cheap shot, but it hardly demonstrates presidential leadership." Former governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts has denounced the immigration bill, which he said would provide "amnesty" to illegal immigrants. While McCain's speech does not mention any candidate by name, his advisers said Romney is the target. Kevin Madden, a Romney spokesman, said McCain's criticism reflected desperation because his views are at odds with those of primary voters. The dozen senators who forged the immigration deal have been able to hold their compromise together so far, beating back amendments that the group deemed to be coalition killers, such as one to strike the bill's temporary-worker program and another to kill its provisions to legalize the nation's 12 million illegal immigrants. This week's amendments are more subtle, and therefore more threatening to the coalition. Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, will push to move up the date before which the backlog of family-based immigration applications would have to be processed by the Department of Homeland Security, adding 833,000 immigrants, and Kyl said he will withdraw his support for the bill if the amendment passes. He will also walk if Menendez and Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, win passage of an amendment that would more than double the number of green cards available under the bill for parents of US citizens. Kyl said conservatives believe the family unification system is abused by illegal immigrants whose US-born children are citizens. Such amendments will be difficult to resist for the compromise's chief Democratic architect, Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who helped create the family unification system in 1965 and whom conservatives are now counting on to help dismantle it. Republicans in the coalition will be expected to oppose amendments that put them in equally difficult positions. was included in this report. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/04/world/middleeast/04cnd-Iraq.html&cid In Video, Insurgents Claim 2 Missing G.I.&#8217;s Are Dead - New York Times In Video, Insurgents Claim 2 Missing G.I.’s Are Dead Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: June 4, 2007 BAGHDAD, June 4 — A Sunni Arab insurgent group released a video on Monday that showed the military identification cards of two missing American soldiers abducted in an ambush south of Baghdad last month, and the group claimed the two had been killed along with one other soldier. The video — from the Islamic State of , an umbrella insurgent group that includes Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia — did not provide proof of whether the two missing soldiers were alive or dead. But an American military official with the missing soldiers’ unit said the identification cards appeared to be authentic, suggesting that the group was involved in the attack. The narrator of the video asserted that the soldiers were dead. “We decided to finish this issue and announce the killing of the soldiers and to make the enemies of God carry the bitter responsibility,” the video’s narrator said. “After the three soldiers were alive as prisoners they became dead bodies.” American military officials said they would study the video for clues and continue searching for the two missing soldiers, Spc. Alex R. Jimenez , 25, of Lawrence, Mass., and Pvt. Byron W. Fouty, 19, of Waterford, Mich. “We’ve been on the lookout for something like this,” said Lt. Col. Christopher Garver, an American military spokesman in Baghdad. Investigators, he said, “will continue to review it for whatever information we can gain from it.” The video did not refer by name to the third abducted soldier, Pfc. Joseph J. Anzack Jr., 20, of Torrance, Calif. Private Anzack’s body was pulled from the Euphrates River in Babil Province, south of Baghdad, 11 days after the ambush on May 12. Videos of kidnapped Westerners and attacks against American troops have frequently been used for propaganda purposes by insurgents. Monday’s video was significant largely because it was less graphic than usual and provided little actual evidence that those who produced the video actually held the two soldiers captive or killed them. Its limited scope and appearance nearly a month after the ambush seemed to confirm what some American military commanders have suspected all along: that the insurgents are seeking to drag out the process of discovery and deny closure to the families of the missing soldiers and the thousands of American and Iraqi troops who have been searching for them since the day they disappeared. The undated video was made available to reporters by the Site Institute, which tracks Jihadist Web sites. Of the nearly 11 minutes of footage, the only portion that purportedly corresponds to the attack shows what appears to be a burning Humvee, videotaped from far away at night for a few seconds. The attack — which occurred before dawn near Yusifiya, a Sunni stronghold about 15 miles south of the capital — did lead to the burning of two Humvees that were attacked, according to military officials. But the video does not show the three soldiers who were abducted nor the five soldiers killed during the ambush, one of whom was an Iraqi. What the video displays is a group of masked men apparently planning the ambush using a diagram pinned to a tree. Personal items that appear to belong to the soldiers are also shown, including a pistol, credit cards and American and Iraqi money. At the end, the video shows a still image of both sides of the photo identifications of Specialist Jimenez and Private Fouty. Above the photos, written in Arabic, was the message, “Bush is the reason for the loss of your sons.” The video repeatedly mocks the American military for being unable to find the three abducted soldiers. Citing the American use of helicopters and unmanned aircraft, the video’s narrator said, “They felt arrogant because of their abilities and their technology, which was humiliated by the Islamic State’s soldiers.” Despite the deployment of 4,000 American troops, the video said, “they failed.” “No one will be held responsible for what happened to the three soldiers,” the narrator said, “except the American Army and its leaders and politicians who degrade all of mankind and do not care for the feelings of the three soldiers’ mothers.” David S.

China promised Monday, June 4, 2007 to reduce greenhouse gases, unveiling a new national climate change program, but rejected mandatory caps as unfair to countries still trying to catch up with the developed West. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) BEIJING - China promised Monday to better control emissions of greenhouse gases, unveiling a new national program to combat global warming, but rejected mandatory caps on emissions as unfair to countries still trying to catch up with the developed West. The program offered few new concrete targets for reducing emissions of the greenhouse gases that are believed to contribute to global warming. But the plan outlined steps China would take to meet a previously announced government goal of improving overall energy efficiency in 2010 by 20 percent over 2005's level. One of China's chief objectives is "to make significant achievements in controlling greenhouse gas emissions," said the report, released by the National Development and Reform Commission, the economic planning agency. Among the measures the government called for were stepped-up efforts to put the hard-charging but inefficient economy on a more sustainable footing, to research and deploy new energy-saving technologies and to plant more trees. Given an economy that has been growing at better than 9 percent annually over the past 25 years, the plan's overall effect, if implemented, would be to slow the increase in greenhouse gases, not reduce their absolute amount. China has fallen under increasing pressure internationally to take more forceful measures to curb releases of greenhouse gases. The country relies on coal , among the dirtiest of fuels , to meet two-thirds of its energy needs and is projected to surpass the U.S. as the world's No. 1 emitter of greenhouse gases sometimes in the next two years. In explaining the new program, the head of China's planning agency said global warming was largely caused by 200 years of unrestrained industrialization by the West, and it would be unfair to impose mandatory emissions caps on China and other developing nations. "This would hinder the development of developing countries and hamper their industrialization," Ma Kai told reporters. The report's release seemed in part an attempt to pre-empt criticism of China when Chinese President Hu Jintao attends an expanded summit of the Group of Eight industrialized nations in Germany this Friday. The summit will feature a session on global warming.

http://www.axcessnews.com/index.php/articles/show/id/11172&cid Democrats debate in New Hampshire Democrats debate in New Hampshire (AXcess News) Washington - Democratic presidential candidates held a debate in New Hampshire last night with victories being declared by more than one of the eight presidential hopefuls, though most primary voters in NH paid closer attention to the leading Democratic candidates - Clinton, Obama and Edwards' responses. All eight Democratic presidential candidates took part in last night's debate in New Hampshire, the site of the first Democratic primary and a place known for its political activism. Wolf Blitzer moderated the debate only this time, the candidates were not held to the rigid structure of timed answers, which helped most of the candidates better respond to questions. Barrack Obama, the Senator from Illinois, responded best to questions about the Iraq war in giving a more regional insight into how it was affecting U.S. relations, both abroad as well as at home. Obama's approach was to consider not just Iraq but the war on terror as a whole in Afghanistan, Iraq and the developments in Iran and Pakistan. He also took to a winning posture against John Edwards when Edwards attempted to play down Obama's view on healthcare stating that most people can't afford the rising cost of healthcare and that making it mandatory would not resolve the gap in healthcare recipients. Hillary Clinton, the only female Democratic presidential candidate, managed to hold onto her esteem when Edward and Obama plucked at her early support for the war in Iraq, but Clinton tiptoed around the onslaught, highlighting her experience in the Senate and that would serve Americans if she were elected to the White House. But Edwards too, had voted for the war in Iraq when he served in the North Carolina Senate. Obama cut Edwards back a notch when he reminded Edwards of his own track record after Edwards criticized both he and Clinton for giving in on the party's mandate for troop withdrawal in the recent Iraq funding bill. "You're about four and a half years late on leadership on this issue," Obama quipped. His comment came after Edwards had stated, "it's the difference between leading and following." All three of the Democratic Party's front runners seemed to walk away from the debate with some measure of victory, holding onto their status in the polls, but never the less, no matter how polite and friendly the Democratic candidates were, you could tell their was friction brewing as the presidential race matures. Never the less, the war in Iraq remained the main theme across the top Democratic presidential candidates for 2008, though voters are growing tired of the same mantra and want to hear more in-depth viewpoints from the candidates. The New Hampshire Democratic presidential debate marked the second time the candidates have met before a live audience. Last month they assembled in South Carolina and the tone of that debate was far more polite. In the latest CBC News Poll, Clinton held a lead over the top Republican presidential candidate, Rudy Giuliani, with a 22 point lead over the ex-New York Mayor, though the poll came last week Thursday and the results following last night's Democratic presidential candidate debate in New Hampshire is still not in. At that time, Clinton held 49 percent of the primary voters in the poll while Giuliani had only 33 percent. But I have to point out that amongst Democrats polled, 63 percent were satisfied with their Party's candidates while only 38 percent of Republican primary voters were satisfied with their Party's slate of presidential candidates. That suggests that Republican contenders better improve their ranks on the issues if they expect to muster enough voter support this November.

India, Brazil bilateral trade to touch $10 bln by 2010: Lula New Delhi, June 4: India and Brazil can achieve their trade target of 10 billion dollars by 2010 and even exceed it, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said today. Addressing captains of Indian industry at a function organised jointly by the three business chambers (CII, ASSOCHAM and FICCI), Mr Lula said both the countries should diversify their trade potential and the significant business delegation is already following Indian example of economic growth. He said New Delhi and Brasilia had created G20, which makes both the countries important in the WTO negotiations and fulfilling Doha Round successfully. The interest of the developing countries and the farmers' dependence on the agriculture are the priorities of the discussion in WTO, Mr Lula added. ''I've been working on the idea that 21st century will be the century of opportunities for the countries who could not take the advantage in 20th century,'' he said. The President said there is a huge potential in the renewable energy sector and Brazil along with India and South Africa are working towards creating a world group to make bio-fuel a source of renewable energy. ''This can generate jobs in the country side and reduce poverty,'' he added. The President also invited the Indian entrepreneurs to invest in its 50-billion-dollar 'Growth Acceleration Programme' to develop the infrastructure. He said India and Brazil have not even identified 10 per cent of the bilateral trade opportunities and there is lot of potential in the exchange of technology and engineering capabilities. President Lula said the government and business communities from both the countries should focus on increasing the bilateral trade with the increased opportunity in the current world market. Brazilian Minister for Development Industry and Foreign Trade Miguel Joao Jorge Filho said both the countries have a lot of business opportunities in pharmaceuticals, bio-fuels, IT, food processing, automobiles parts, mining, civil aviation, medical equipments, infrastructure and railway equipments. Brazil is looking forward to Indian entrepreneurs to explore great opportunity to exchange experiences and knowledge. JVs and partnerships in the field of IT, engineering, petrol, chemical and medicine are already adding to the business between the two countries and new sectors of businesses should also be looked at, Mr Filho added. Mr Anand Sharma, Minister of State for External Affairs, said India and Brazil share strong bilateral trade relationship and have global dimension. He said Brazil has competitive and diversified industrial structure with main sectors as chemicals, food products, automotive vehicles, aviation, basic metal products, machines and clothing. India and Brazil are both consumer driven society and are open to investment and JVs from India and other countries. Brazil and India have robust economy and both the countries believe in inclusive growth, said Malvinder Mohan Singh, Chairman, CII National Committee on Technology and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd CEO and Managing Director. He said both the countries are collaborating in bio-technology and pharmaceutical sectors and have lot of opportunities in other sectors also. Both the countries face similar challenges in the world market and together should explore the potential.

Seacoast Officials Rule Out Methane Explosions As Cause Of Sounds POSTED: 10:39 am EDT June 4, 2007 Sign Up for Breaking News Alerts Three mild earthquakes were recorded in New Hampshire over the weekend. The Emergency Management Agency said the quakes hit Saturday night and Sunday afternoon in the Portsmouth-Exeter area. The earthquakes, which sounded like explosions, rattled a lot of wall photos and cupboard items but didn't cause any damage or injuries. Initially, officials investigated whether the explosive sounds were underground methane gas explosions. They found the gas escaping from the ground in Portsmouth on Saturday evening. But after comparing the times scores of 911 calls came in with the times recorded for the tremors, Assistant Fire Chief Steven Achilles said authorities have ruled out underground gas explosions as the cause of the ground-shaking. "Now that we can link the time of the 911 calls to specific events, we feel a lot more confident," said Achilles. He said all three incidents at 8 and 10:35 Saturday night and 2:35 Sunday afternoon coincided with seismic activity reported by emergency management officials. He said the methane gas discovery either was a coincidence or else caused by the earth tremors. The strongest of the quakes was centered seven miles southwest of Portsmouth. The second tremor Saturday night was centered 1.5 miles north of Exeter. . All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. Company coming?

The long-awaited lawsuit came on the day when former Bosnian Serb Gen. Zdravko Tolimir, one of the main suspects in the killings in which up to 8,000 men and boys died, was arraigned before the U.N. war crimes tribunal but declined to enter a plea.

VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article "The goal is not financial for the mothers and other survivors: it's about satisfaction," said lawyer Marco Gerritsen, who will represent 6,000 family members of victims in the class action lawsuit. "Unfortunately, the U.N. and the Dutch state are not willing to take their responsibility _ they do not even want to talk about it." In evidence-gathering civil hearings in 2005, a lawyer for the Dutch state argued that compensation claims should be directed at the perpetrators of the massacre: the Bosnian Serb troops under the authority of Gen. Ratko Mladic and political leader Radovan Karadzic, the U.N. tribunal's most-wanted fugitives. About 200 survivors from the group known as the Mothers of Srebrenica traveled from Bosnia to accompany lawyers as they delivered the civil summons at the Dutch Supreme Court Monday, where claims against the state must be filed. The lawsuit's chances of success are uncertain, and the degree of culpability of the U.N. and its Dutch soldiers in the massacre is fiercely debated. During the 1992-95 Bosnian war, the U.N. declared Srebrenica _ which had been besieged by Serb forces _ a U.N.-protected safe area for civilians. But around 450 Dutch soldiers on peacekeeping duty stood by helplessly as thousands of Bosnian Serb forces stormed the region in July 1995. In a chaotic and menacing situation, Dutch soldiers even assisted in separating the women from the men, who were taken away in buses by the Serb forces and murdered, their bodies buried in mass graves. An independent study by the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation cleared the Dutch troops of blame, noting they were outnumbered, lightly armed, undersupplied, and under instructions to fire only in self-defense. However, the institute's 2002 report assigned partial blame to the Dutch government for setting the troops up to fail, prompting the Cabinet of Prime Minister Wim Kok to resign. Former U.N. director-general Kofi Annan admitted "errors of judgment," regarding Srebrenica in 1999. The Dutch government has accepted "political responsibility" for the mission's failure, and gives around $20 million in aid to Bosnia annually, of which a third is reserved for projects related to rebuilding Srebrenica. Lawyer Gerritsen said that it wasn't enough for the Dutch to compensate the Bosnian government, that it must also compensate the victims personally. He said the initial filing requests $34,000 in compensation for 10 mothers of victims. Other lawyers representing survivors in the past have said $2.7 billion in compensation would be the starting point for negotiations in a settlement. The International Court of Justice earlier this year dismissed a claim filed by Bosnia against Serbia seeking compensation for the genocide at Srebrenica; Bosnian Serbs were primarily behind the massacre and links with neighboring Serbia were too tenuous, the court found. Tolimir's appearance before judges at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal was his first since he was arrested at the Bosnian border with Serbia last week after two years on the run. One of Mladic's top aides, he is charged with genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, extermination, murder, persecution, forcible transfer and deportation, as well as murder in connection with the Srebrenica massacre. Tolimir complained that international laws were not obeyed in his arrest and extradition, which he said took place in his "native country" of Serbia without opportunity to consult a lawyer. In addition he said he was filmed illegally during his arrest. "My health is very bad: I've had three attacks, strokes" and he was losing weight, he said.

Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Monday, Jun 4, 2007 Posted on Mon, Jun. 04, 2007 McCain, Romney Clash Over Immigration Republican presidential hopeful former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney addresses Tennessee Republicans during the Statesman dinner in Nashville, Tenn., Saturday, June 2, 2007. (AP Photo/John Russell) CORAL GABLES, Fla. - Republican presidential hopefuls John McCain and Mitt Romney clashed on Monday over the immigration bill, with McCain embracing the measure as a practical solution and Romney dismissing it as unworkable. Speaking in politically crucial Florida, with its heavy concentration of Cuban and Haitian immigrants, McCain argued that while the bill is imperfect, it is an attempt to secure U.S. borders, help the economy and identify those who have entered the nation illegally. The four-term Arizona senator chided rivals who are trying to score points on the issue. McCain never mentioned any names but his target was obvious , Romney. "To want the office so badly that you would intentionally make our country's problems worse might prove you can read a poll or take a cheap shot, but it hardly demonstrates presidential leadership," McCain told members of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce. "The immigration approach proposed by Senators McCain and Kennedy falls short of a workable solution to an important problem," the former Massachusetts governor said in a statement. Romney said he respected McCain, but his opposition was based on a "principled disagreement about policies and priorities related to enforcement of our immigration laws." The immigration measure would tighten security on the Mexican border while allowing some of the 12 million illegal immigrants a chance to stay in the United States and eventually become citizens. President Bush has spoken out in favor of the bipartisan bill. Romney did not mention the president, instead describing the immigration approach of McCain and liberal icon Kennedy. McCain said Bush understands the political implications. "The president knows. He spent eight years as governor of Texas," McCain told The Associated Press after his speech. "The Republican Party must address this issue, if, in my part of the country, we expect to attract Hispanic voters." McCain stands alone among the major candidates in supporting the bill. He has criticized Romney for opposing the measure based on provisions that would provide a path to legalization. "I will never conduct my campaign in such a way that it makes our country's most difficult challenges harder to solve. I hope you will hold all candidates to that same standard. Pandering for votes on this issue, while offering no solution to the problem, amounts to doing nothing. And doing nothing is silent amnesty," McCain said to loud applause. Another GOP rival, former New York city Mayor Rudy Giuliani, also opposes the bill, but has said he is willing to compromise on how to deal with the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States as long as he is satisfied all security issues are addressed. Romney has not offered a detailed plan on how he would handle illegal immigrants, but he said recently a priority would be to deport criminals and remove illegal immigrants from government assistance programs. Romney's response to the bill has varied with his audience. Most of his criticism has focused on the so-called Z-visa, a document proposed for registering the estimated 12 million illegal aliens in the country. Last month in South Carolina, home to the type of social conservatives Romney is courting, he said, "I think we should not call it the 'Z' visa; we should call it the 'A' visa, because it's amnesty and that's what it stands for." Yet a week later in Florida, he said, "There are some who get involved in whether it is technically amnesty or not and I'm not really trying to define what is technically amnesty. I'll let the lawyers do that." Despite his amnesty complaints, Romney said he would not favor rounding up the illegal immigrants already in the country. Rather, he supports them self-reporting to immigration authorities. McCain chose a supportive crowd to deliver his 25-minute address Monday. Many of the Miami area's business leaders are immigrants or children of immigrants. He was given an extended ovation before beginning his speech and his remarks were interrupted several times by applause. "Florida is a living testament to the benefits of immigration, a great and prosperous state built in large part by immigrants who came here to escape tyranny and despair," he said.

The challenge for the prosecution will be to prove that Charles Taylor can be held criminally liable for some of the most stomach-churning crimes ever documented. The former Liberian President, Charles Taylor, is accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity in neighbouring Sierra Leone, during the barbarous civil war there, when he backed rebel forces, who hacked off limbs, forced tiny children into battle, and pillaged, raped and murdered; acts of extreme violence in which up to 200,000 died. Making the charges stick will depend on proving Charles Taylor bore command responsibility. For Africa, today&#039;s trial is a momentous occasion - don&#039;t be fooled by the fact it doesn&#039;t look like one. This, the day an African head of state was called to account; except he upstaged everyone by boycotting the event. The lawyer read Charles Taylor&#039;s statement: "I cannot participate in a charade that does no justice to the people of Liberia and Sierra Leone. I choose not to be a fig leaf of legitimacy for this court." - Karim Ahmed Khan, Defence Lawyer "I cannot participate in a charade that does no justice to the people of Liberia and Sierra Leone. I choose not to be a fig leaf of legitimacy for this court." - Karim Ahmed Khan, Defence Lawyer The lawyer added he&#039;d now been dismissed by Mr Taylor. The judge instructed him to defend him anyway, but in a dramatic twist befitting the trial of another modern tyrant, he refuses. In Freetown, victims of the civil war watched all this in disbelief by satellite link inside the UN special tribunal building. The trial&#039;s being conducted at the International Criminal Court in The Netherlands because of fears that five years after the civil war ended Charles Taylor&#039;s presence in West Africa could still destabilise the region. Pictures, never published until now, show Charles Taylor 20 years ago, training in the Libyan desert, the guest of Colonel Muamar Qadafi. In 1989 Taylor launched a rebellion in Liberia which over the next ten years would engulf the region. In Sierra Leone he&#039;s accused of commanding a campaign of terror to overthrow the government and seize its diamond mines. Today the prosecution&#039;s charge sheet: a catalogue of horrors. The exceptional gruesomeness of the conflict is beyond dispute -- even by Charles Taylor&#039;s erstwhile defence lawyers. What the prosecution must prove, with tens of thousands of documents and the 139 witnesses they&#039;ve called, is that he knew what was going on that he could have stopped it. Background: Charles Taylor trial Former Liberian president Charles Taylor goes on trial for war crimes in the Sierra Leone civil war. Find out why. "What command responsibility says is that even if you were not there, even if you were not intricately involved in making every single decision, if you were in the position as a superior in command of subordinates, of individuals that undertook these acts, and you knew or should have known that these atrocities were taking place, then you as the superior can be held accountable for those crimes." - Mark Ellis, International Bar Association Charles Taylor was overthrown as President of Liberia four years ago. Later Nigeria, to which he&#039;d fled, surrendered him to the UN court. He&#039;s already pleaded not guilty, casting himself as "a sacrificial lamb." Few in West Africa see him as a victim though&#039; he&#039;s the one accused of slaughter, rape and mutilation and the recruitment and conscription of child soldiers. A chance then that the victims of these crimes against humanity will see justice done; the message from The Hague today: dictators beware.

A hushed chat in Tiananmen Square Posted: Monday, June 04, 2007 1:45 PM By Marisa Buchanan, NBC News Producer It seems like just another day in Tiananmen Square, even though itâ€™s far from it -- itâ€™s the 18th anniversary of the 1989 government crackdown on student demonstrations in and around Beijing. The numbers of people who died at the hand of the Chinese government have never been released, though there are estimates of more than 1,000. But today you would never know it even happened. There is no anniversary news in the papers in Beijing, no candlelight memorials, no flowers at the foot of any of the monuments in the square. Journalists, especially with TV cameras, usually get stopped even on regular days in the square, but leading up to the Olympics the police seem on their best behavior, so I was curious what would happen today in terms of access. Slideshow: Remembering Tiananmen Square So as I emerged from the subway into the square, I took out my cell phone camera as I began to walk around. Then I took out my other camera, which is small but it looks a bit more professional than your average tourist. No one stopped me even though I was trailed a bit here and there by guards. Periodically their vans cruised up next to me and loitered. A watch seller who struck up a conversation with me was shooed away by the police, but they said nothing to me. Otherwise, Chinese tourists just asked to look at my camera and asked me to be in their pictures. After a short stroll, I sat down to take in the sights and sounds of the square. With the sun shining, it was a picture-postcard scene â€“ no small feat in often-rainy Beijing. I tried to imagine what it was like over those days and nights 18 years ago. I have read a lot about that period, seen all the footage of the chaos â€“ students gathered, tanks, barricades, banners waving. The only waving I saw today was small children running around with Chinese flags, and older children waving over to their mothers to take pictures. It was what I was expecting â€“ just another day in Tiananmen Square. Then something unusual happened. "Excuse me, do you know what happened here?" asked a teenage-looking girl as she sat down next to me. In a quiet voice she repeated herself, "Do you know what happened here â€“1989?" No one was in earshot but she pulled out her map next to me, to look like any other tourist. I nodded and smiled, not wanting to bring undue attention to her. Did she understand how bold she was being? Talking about this to me, in the middle of the square today of all days? I soon realized she did. She introduced herself and explained she was visiting Beijing from Hong Kong. She had not planned to visit the square on this particular day, but decided at the last minute she had to be. She told me she was born four months after the demonstrations and that the events of June 4, 1989 are a history lesson to her. She knows she was lucky to even know about it at all â€“ on mainland China the protests have been erased from history books. She told me she felt ashamed for her country and wishes it was acknowledged that so many people died and says the government made a mistake in how they handled the protesters 18 years ago. I am the third foreigner she had gone up to today. She had asked the others â€“ they know what happened, did they care? I told her I thought she was very brave. "Chinese people come here for happiness now," she tells me. "They are too busy taking pictures. But I will talk about it for them. For them itâ€™s too risky." Protests take on a different form Risky? Yes, but what do the Chinese need to protest these days? The Tiananmen protests had as much to do at the time with unemployment and widespread corruption as they did with democracy. Since 1989 the Chinese government certainly has accomplished a lot. They have raised millions out of poverty. The nationâ€™s economy has skyrocketed and investment has flourished. Having the Olympics here is as big a tip of the global hat as any country can get â€“ a tribute to its mass appeal and potential for more growth. however, have not gone away. But the Chinese are savvier and certainly more careful about how they handle them. Now in the age of the Internet, Chinese protest against their homes being demolished, the AIDS epidemic being concealed, and just this week in the southern town of Xiamen had been recommended to me before I came to China for its clean air. But now a "chemical shadow looms over Xiamen," as one Chinese journalist put it. Only 10 miles from the city center, a plant is being built that produces a chemical called p-xyalene which is known, in large quantities, to cause liver and kidney damage. That news has been mostly pulled from the national and local papers, but people have been aided by new technology in disseminating information about the plant. A text message did the rounds last week saying: "we want to live, we want our health, for the sake of future generations pass this message on to all your Xiamen friends." There also was live blogging from street protests there this past Friday and Sunday. Several thousand people marched with banners in the midst of police loudspeakers announcing that their protests were illegal. All the activity has had an impact. The city council, even though it did not acknowledge the public reaction, has temporarily suspended the building of the plant. I also saw video of the protests in various forms on You Tube and photographs on personal blogs. Grievances might be stifled, Web sites blocked and penalties harsh, but people still find a way to be heard. The young woman who sat next to me is just one of those. More questions than answers After our initial conversation, we sat in silence just watching families on the square. Then suddenly she said that the longer she sat there, the angrier and sadder she became. She wanted someone to know that she remembers the protesters actions. "Why after all this time is it still not discussed?" she asked. "Why can I only talk about it with you?" She pointed to monuments around the square, "Here are the heroes of our country but, the protestors of 1989 are also heroes." As she got up to say goodbye, she said "People lost their life. I want justice for them. I would be proud of China if one day they just said sorryâ€¦ Thank you for hearing me." I couldnâ€™t help thinking how this bold 17-year-old now seemed to have more questions than answers. She doesnâ€™t know how many died or how many were jailed or executed. There is no museum to learn from, no monument. She is surrounded by her countrymen, but she had no one to talk to but me. Yea i read about tiananman square quite a few times within the past few months. That is an atrocity and I cant believe those people never just wiped their own government out on their own. I remember also something not mentioned by this article. Tank man is all he is known by and for all those who wanna read something interesting google tiananmen square and tank man......funny tho.....you wont find it on any search engine in China......why u may ask?......cause it would give those people hope and pride to keep fighting. David, Hopewell Jct, NY (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 3:09 PM) This article was extremely powerful. I really appreciate this little piece of China. Hopefully one day her wish will come true. Thank you. Taunja Ruch, Chapel Hill, NC (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 3:20 PM) This is a timely article...and hints loudly at what I found, in visiting China, to be the suppressed longing of the Chinese: to express their dismay over the massacre and to express their passionate longing for Democracy...and religious freedom, most of all. If the Chinese government were wise, they would allow freedom of expression...because then China truly would be the world's most powerful nation...and, of course, in the best possible way. The Chinese are so deeply and unusually committed to ideals...which amazed me and, at the same time, made me realize that this is, or could be, the REAL power of China, along with all their brilliance in other endeavors. If China ever allows for freedom of expression, they will have the full support of their populace, and they will be the tour de force of the universe! It is only to their detriment to keep repressing the irrepressible. It will, I think, be their eventual downfall. Afterall, I found the "common people" of China are anything but common.

But the world needs stupid people from time to time. What I really like about this article is to read how the pervasive snooping technolgies are being turned against the oppressive governments, quite the opposite of that predicted by Orwell. Jim Smith, Denver, CO (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 3:57 PM) Not only is this chemical nation problem for those who reside there it is equally a problem for the rest of the world as these chemicals make their way into foods, supplements, and just about everything else that absorbs the toxins imported to the US and other countries. It's not safe to import from China any more - half way around the world people are developing liver cancer due to toxins mixed into imported supplements - it's a disease on the rise in the US. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 3:58 PM) So touching, and I thank the nameless young woman for reaching out to tell US not to forget what happened and why. May she and hopefully others keep the spirit of that ill-fated time in China. May WE not forget our own history, and thank those who are still on this earth to thank for our freedom. LaNell Barrett, Naples, Florida (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:03 PM) I thought this was a good article. I remember when a protesting student was crushed with a tank at Tiananmen Square. I think the students that protested against the Chinese government were brave and should be remembered. These kids forfeited their lives just for having differnt ideas. China should feel shame on this anniversary. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:17 PM) I have been visiting China on business for 10 years and have many friends there. I once showed a picture of the student facing down the tanks in Tiannamen Square to friend and she had never seen it, nor knew anything about it. This is a college educated professional who deals with foriegners everyday. When I tried to give her the web address, she could not access the site. As Americans, we could do a better job of spreading the word about the advantages of freedom both during a protest and more importantly, after the protest has been crushed. Other friends there are willing to discuss politics of China, but are noticeably careful of who is in ear shot. When I show them thiongs like jibjab.com and Kieth Olberman lambasting Bush they cannot believe our government would allow such ridicule and attacks. It leads one to wonder what China would be if, Like George Washington, Mao had won the revolution and then turned the armies over to the people. Would the cold war ever have occurred? The good news is that for the first time in history, the common person in China is starting to get a taste of freedom and it is very difficult to take that away from a billion plus freedom starved people. Let's keep the doors open for them! John Olier, Gulf Breeze, Florida (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:46 PM) The people of the world who witnessed the protest and it's aftermath will never forget. Tom Win, Monroe Twp. New Jersey (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:49 PM) I am not an appologist for China, and do agree that the events of 18 years ago could well have been handled differently, further that there is little that a Westerner would recgonize as Freedom of Expression in todays China. However, China has a lot at stake, they must deliver a modern economey or face what could very well be starvation - their history of a revolt every 50 years and purges in between is only too well know to them; it is in this context, that the more brutal actions of the Chinese State must be understood. If they deliver on their economic Industrial Revolution, then other things (environment, civil liberty) will eventually fall in place - If they fail then anarchy will be the result.

Monday, June 04, 2007 The plot to blow up fuel tanks at John F. Kennedy airport in New York had been in its planning stages, and had been followed by FBI for 16 months. Despite not being close to completion, the intention of the plotters was to create maximum havoc and destruction, hoping that the fuel dumps would then destroy terminal buildings and aircraft on the ground. US Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf said the scheme was "one of the most chilling plots imaginable. The devastation that would have been caused if this had succeeded are unthinkable." The main instigator of the plot was a black Muslim named Russell Defreitas who had formerly worked at the airport as a cargo handler for a private company. Defreitas, aged 63, is a US citizen who came originally from Guyana. Defreitas was arraigned at a court in Brooklyn, awaiting a bail hearing which will take place on Wednesday, June 6. The information from his indictment contains some quotes from Defreitas. He had seen cargo being exported to Israel and assumed it would be used to kill Muslims, and had decided that the "bastards would have to pay." He had been caught on surveillance stating: "Anytime you hit Kennedy, it is the most hurtful thing to the United States. To hit John F. Kennedy, wow... They love John F. Kennedy like he's the man... If you hit that, this whole country will be in mourning. It's like you can kill the man twice." Defreitas had resigned from his job at JFK in 1995, and had been arrested in Brooklyn on Friday night. The plot had been code-named the "chicken farm". Abdul Kadir was arrested around 11 a.m. on Friday at the Piarco airport in Trinidad. The day before, he had flown into Trinidad from Guyana, and was apprehended as he was trying to board a plane to Venezuela. Another man was arrested in Trinidad - Kareem Ibrahim, while Guyanese suspect Abdel Nur was still being sought. Trinidadian media suggests that Nur may be in hiding on Trinidad island. Abdul Kadir's wife Isha has to the indictment's claims. She claimed that her husband had been going to Venezuela to pick up a travel visa to attend a religious convention in Iran. It should be noted that Hizbollah has a in Hugo Chavez's socialist state of Venezuela, which threatened to attack the US. The Venezuelan Hizbollah (hezbollah) is around the Lebanese expatriate community on Margarita Island. The indictment against Russell Defreitas mentions how he had been incensed by the conflict which had been initiated by the Shia terrorist group Hizbollah last year, which led to parts of Lebanon engaged in conflict with Israel. It is not apparent whether Defreitas was a Shia or Sunni Muslim, but it is certain that the other three suspects are Shia. Abdul Kadir was the imam of a Shia mosque in Guyana. 56-year old Kareem Ibrahim is the imam of one of the two main Shia mosques in Trinidad. This is based at Canefarm in Tacarigua, states the . He is a father of five children and sells Islamic books. In Guyana, Abdul Kadir a qualified civil engineer, was an imam, but also was a member of the main opposition party, the People's National Congress/Reform party. He is a father of nine children. He was a member of parliament for the Upper Demarara, Upper Berbice area between 2001 and 2006. He became a Shia Muslim in 1974. He had also lived in Venezuela for a short time, according to the Trinidad Express. He had also at one stage been the mayor of Linden, Guyana's second largest town. The main Islamist group in Trinidad is the , which staged a coup on Trinidad island on July 27, 1990, in which parliament was held hostage, the TV station was taken over, and 20 people were killed. Jamaat al-Muslimeen has been suspected of setting off a campaign of bombs which lasted from July to October 2005, but this group is Shia. However, Kareem Ibrahim is said to have visited the Jamaat al-Muslimeen's headquarters in Mucurapo Rd, Port of Spain, "on occasion". Yesterday, members of the FBI visited the Jamaat HQ, but according to Trinidadian Police Commissioner Trevor Paul, there was no information to link Jamaat al-Muslimeen to the JFK plot. The president of Guyana, Bharrat Jagdeo certain media claims that Abdul Kadir had been a "government official". He pledged his support to operations to tackle terrorism, and said that he had told the US ambassador: "I said to the ambassador that we could not tolerate anyone who is implicated in any terrorist act or any conspiracy to commit terror." There have been links between Trinidadian members of Jamaat al-Muslimeen and terrorist activity in Guyana. The Guyanese Agriculture Minister, Satyadeow Sawh, was gunned down on the verandah of his home, along with members of his family, on April 22, 2006. The killers included David Millard, aka Buffy, aka Mustapha Abdullah Muhammad, who was a Jamaat al-Muslimeen fugitive, who had fled Trinidad to Guyana after being accused of the murder of a woman and conspiracy to murder two members of the Jamaat. He is currently in custody in Trinidad. Muslims in Trinidad make up less than 10 percent of the entire population, while Guyana which has a larger population of people whose origins are from the Indian subcontinent, has about 15 percent of its population being Muslim. In both countries, the vast majority of Muslims are Sunnis, and Shias are few in number. Adrian Morgan is a British based writer and artist who has written for since its inception.

Phuong Tran has more from VOA's West Africa bureau in Dakar. The only survivor of Sunday's fiery crash is one on the pilots. Witnesses said the more than 20 other people on the helicopter, most of them from Togo, were burned beyond recognition. Togo's national sports minister, Atipe Kwako, is believed to be among the dead. Helicopter and ferry are the only way to reach the Freetown airport, which is located across a bay from the capital. The Togolese had been in Sierra Leone for an African Nations Cup qualifier match between Togo and Sierra Leone, which Togo won, 1-0. An airline maintenance officer at the Sierra Leonean airport said the helicopter caught fire shortly before landing. He says Paramount Airlines owned and operated the Russian-made helicopter. Togolese journalist Modeste Messavussu says most people are in shock because football is more than a sport for the Togolese. He says football is what has slowly reunited a country divided since the presidential election in 2005 that brought President Faure Gnassingb&eacute; to power. That year, thousands of Togolese fled violence between the ruling and opposition parties. Human rights organizations reported widespread repression, a media blackout, and beatings that left more than 50 dead. "The football is like a reconciliation [sport]," said Messavussu. "They [Togolese] forget all their political problems and everybody is happy. They forget all the [political] problems. Because of that, everybody is crying today." No members of the Togolese football team were on board the downed helicopter. They were waiting for the next airport shuttle. The journalist says the team will now fly home on a plane chartered by the Togolese government. Spokesman Gahoum Hegbor says the Togolese government has launched an investigation into what caused the crash.

http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/putin-threatens-to-aim-missiles-at-europe/2007/06/04/1180809398752.html&cid Putin threatens to aim missiles at Europe - World - smh.com.au Welcome to The Sydney Morning Herald. Putin threatens to aim missiles at Europe June 4, 2007 - 2:17PM  Tensions rising ... President Vladimir Putin has threatened to point Russia's missiles at Europe. President Vladimir Putin says Russia will go back to its Cold War stance of aiming its missiles at Europe if Washington goes ahead with a plan to build a missile defence shield near Russia's borders. In an interview released late yesterday, Putin acknowledged that Russia's response risked reviving an arms race in Europe but said Moscow would not be responsible for the consequences because Washington had started the escalation. Putin made the tough statement before what is likely to be a frosty Group of Eight summit in Germany on June 6 where, among other world leaders, he will come face to face with US President George W Bush. Russia has not specifically targeted its missiles at Europe since the end of the Cold War but, asked if it might return to that if the US missile shield plan went ahead, Putin said: "Of course we are returning to those times. "It is clear that if a part of the US nuclear capability turns up in Europe, and, in the opinion of our military specialists, will threaten us, then we are forced to take corresponding steps in response. "What will those steps be? Naturally, we will have to have new targets in Europe." Russia's combative response to the US missile shield has prompted comparisons with the Cold War. Putin has directed angry rhetoric at the White House, last week calling US policy "imperialist". Russia has test-launched a new ballistic missile in a move it tied to the US missile plans, and suspended its compliance with a treaty limiting the deployment of conventional forces near Russia's western borders. Putin's warning that missiles might once again be pointed at European targets carries a clear political message but has few practical implications. Even after the Cold War ended, Russia retained the capability to hit European and US targets. Training ballistic missiles on a particular target is a fairly simple technical task that can be done in a matter of minutes. Putin's comments came in an interview he gave to selected media from G8 countries on Friday. The Kremlin released a transcript of the interview on its Internet site Russia's response to the US missile moves would be to develop "more effective offensive systems", Putin said in the interview. "We know that that risks restarting an arms race, for which we will not be responsible. It was not us who started altering the strategic balance," the Russian president said. "Today we warn: if a new missile defence system is deployed in Europe there will be a response. We are forced to ensure our security." Washington wants to locate elements of its planned shield -- including a radar station and interceptor missiles -- in Poland and the Czech Republic. It says the shield is not a threat to Russia but is designed to protect against possible missile attacks from what it calls "rogue states" such as Iran and North Korea. Putin said that was not credible. "There are no Iranian missiles with the necessary range," he said. "So it becomes obvious that this innovation is about us Russians." Putin reiterated that a military escalation was not Russia's choice. "We are not in favour of confrontation," he said. "We are in favour of a dialogue. "We want to be heard, we want our position to be understood. We do not rule out that our US partners could review their decision (to build the missile shield). "But if that does not happen, we lift from ourselves any responsibility for the steps we take in response because we are not the ones who are initiating the looming arms race in Europe." send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today Putin threatens to aim missiles at Europe  Tensions rising ...

Hillary Clinton managed to take most of the debate but the Democrats had plenty of fireworks to throw out there. Edwards attacked Clinton and Obama stating that they refused to say they would vote against the Iraq spending bill put out last week until the very last available time. &#8220;They went quietly to the floor of the Senate. They were among the last people to vote,&#8221; he said during their televised New Hampshire debate. &#8220;They cast the right vote, and I applaud them for that. &#8230; But there is a difference between leadership and legislating.&#8221; Obama fired back stating that Edwards voted in 2002 to go to war. Clinton managed to avoid the huge arguments by Obama and Edwards and instead attacked President Bush. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to point out this is George Bush&#8217;s war,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He started the war. He mismanaged the war. He escalated the war. And he refuses to end the war.&#8221; Needless to say it was a night full of fireworks to kick off debates as the Democrats continue their run to the White House.

Monday, 4th June 2007 Mon 4 Jun 2007 Two Ugandan African Union (AU) soldiers patrol outside the peacekeepers' Halane base near Mogadishu's airport, June 2, 2007. REUTERS/Shabelle Media Somali group says behind attack on premier DUBAI (Reuters) - A Somali Islamist group on Monday claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that targeted the Horn of Africa country's prime minister, according to a statement posted on the Internet. Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi has accused al Qaeda of being behind Sunday's suicide bombing that killed seven people outside his home in Mogadishu, and said its militants had to be eliminated. "A lion of the Mujahideen Youth Movement, our brave brother Abdul-Aziz Mohammad Semter ... carried out a heroic martyrdom operation at the residence of the apostate prime minister," the group said in the statement. "The operation ... resulted in several deaths and injuries and we will provide the details of the operation at a later stage," said the group, adding that the will of the bomber will also be posted. Five soldiers and two civilians were killed when the bomber detonated a vehicle rigged with explosives at the gates of Gedi's residence in a heavily guarded neighbourhood. African Union peacekeepers raced to the area and whisked the prime minister to safety. "Your brethren at the Mujahideen Youth Movement are pressing on with their holy fight against all occupiers and apostates." Near daily attacks on government troops and their Ethiopian military allies are blamed on members of a defeated Islamist movement who have vowed to wage an "Iraq-style" insurgency. Gedi's interim administration is struggling to impose its authority on the anarchic nation. The posting could not be immediately verified but was on a site used by al Qaeda and other Islamists.

The strongest of the quakes &#8212; at about 8 p.m. Saturday &#8212; registered 1.9 on the Richter Scale. Weston Observatory Dept. of Geology and Geophysics Emergency 911 received hundreds of calls as a result of the three quakes. Assistant Fire Chief Steven Achilles said late Sunday afternoon that he had ruled out underground methane gas explosions as the cause of the ground-shaking that affected hundreds in the area off Lafayette Road. Achilles said all three incidents &#8212; at 8 p.m. and 10:35 p.m. on Saturday and at 2:35 p.m. on Sunday &#8212; coincided with seismic activity reported by emergency management officials. Portsmouth Police Capt. David "Lou" Ferland said there was a minor, associated methane leak along Peverly Hill Road late Saturday night. Although utility officials confirmed high levels of methane gas in the area following Saturday's quakes, Achilles said emergency officials determined it was either a coincidence or else caused by the earth tremors, but it was not the cause. "Now that we can link the time of the 911 calls to specific events, we feel a lot more confident," said Achilles. No property damage, power loss or personal injuries were reported, said Ferland. Ferland, who was the shift commander at the time of the Saturday earthquakes, said Emergency 911 received dozens of calls after each event. Callers were reporting a loud explosion during the first event and said their homes shook. Police and fire officials determined that the sound was not thunder. "By 10:30 p.m., the closest lightning strikes were 28 miles away," said Achilles. Achilles, who lives in Elwyn Park, said he felt the first tremors at his house, but did not experience the ground shaking during the second and third quakes. After the second event Saturday, police set up a command post at Market Basket on Lafayette Road and secured the area. After ensuring the tremors and loud blast heard at 8 p.m. were not caused by explosives, police began going door to door, taking reports in the Elwyn Park neighborhood, in the area stretching from Peverly Hill Road to Ocean Road, said Ferland. "They heard a loud bang," said Ferland. "One guy said he was lying on his sofa, and it almost pushed him off the sofa." Calls from residents of the Springbrook Circle and Beachstone neighborhoods were heavy, he said. At the same time, Ferland said, officials were in contact with state emergency management officials, the National Weather Service and the weather service atop Mount Washington. They also called in Public Service of New Hampshire and Northern Utilities. The gas company brought in gas-sniffing dogs that detected the higher than normal methane levels, said Ferland. Only the 10:35 p.m. event was recorded by the Weston Observatory Department of Geology and Geophysics at Boston College, said Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency spokesman Peter Judge. The U.S. Geological Service recorded both Saturday quakes. According to the USGS, the epicenter of the 8 p.m. quake Saturday was seven miles southwest of Portsmouth. The epicenter of the 10:35 p.m. quake was 1.5 miles north of Exeter. The Sunday quake reported to police by dozens of callers has not been recorded on either organization's Web site. "We didn't receive any reports of people feeling the tremors here in Exeter," said Exeter Assistant Fire Chief Kenneth Berkenbush. MEMA's Judge said, "It's not unusual to (receive) multiple calls for days around a quake. (The public's) sensitivity gets raised. "New England is located in a moderate earthquake zone."

The war crimes trial of former Liberian president Charles Taylor, accused of controlling rebel groups in neighbouring Sierra Leone that went on a blood diamond-financed rampage of rape and mutilation, starts here Monday. The first African head of state to go on trial for war crimes before an international tribunal, Taylor will be tried by the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone. Taylor, 59, faces 11 charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes committed during the 1991-2001 civil war in Sierra Leone, considered one of the most brutal in modern history. Up to 200,000 people were killed in the fighting and rebels mutilated thousands more, cutting off arms or legs, ears or noses. According to the charges against him Taylor armed, trained and controlled Sierra Leone's notorious Revolutionary United Front (RUF), responsible for many of the mutilations, in exchange for still-unknown amounts of so-called blood diamonds. Taylor has denied all the charges. In Sierra Leone relief prevailed that Taylor was finally going on trial nearly four years after he was indicted. "It has taken so long in coming that our memories were beginning to fade," war victim Ansumana Turay, whose hands were hacked off during the civil war, told AFP in Freetown. "There can be no peace without justice and that is what this case stands for," said Stephen Rapp, the prosecutor for the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL). With his war crimes trial in The Hague, Taylor follows in the footsteps of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, who was the first ever head of state to go on trial for war crimes before an international court. Milosevic died March 11, 2006 -- in the same prison in The Hague where Taylor is now being held -- while his trial was still underway before the UN court for the former Yugoslavia. In the run-up to the trial, Taylor's defence lawyer Karim Khan repeatedly complained that he did not have enough time or resources to properly prepare for the trial. He also protested the change of venue, saying it affected the former president's right to a fair trial. Sierra Leonean authorities had requested the trial be held in The Hague as they feared holding it in Freetown could cause unrest as Taylor is believed to still have many supporters. Some human rights organisations and victims have also complained about the trial's move to The Hague saying it would be better for the victims in Sierra Leone to see him judged there. "My only regret is that he is not going to be tried here. I would have liked to see him physically in the dock," Sam Tobias, another war victim from Sierra Leone who was starved of food and water for several days and forced to dig for diamonds, said. On Monday the prosecution will present its opening statement, expected to last some four hours, outlining the evidence it intends to present. Then the court will adjourn until June 25, when the first witness will take the stand. The trial is expected to finish within 18 months, before Christmas 2008. If convicted, the statute of the Sierra Leone tribunal states that Taylor must be sentenced to "imprisonment for a specified number of years" without giving a maximum. Under the deal to relocate the trial to the Netherlands, it was agreed that if convicted Taylor will serve his sentence in a British jail.

It also made clear that it would not sacrifice economic growth to satisfy international demands to help curb emissions. The 62-page document released by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China's economic planning agency, is more of a broad outline of the country's policy intentions rather than a detailed roadmap of specific targets. It does, however, list the steps China will take to meet its previously announced goal of boosting its 2005-level of energy efficiency by 20 per cent before the end of this decade. These steps include promoting the adoption of new energy-saving technologies and the planting of more trees. The plan promises "to integrate climate change policy into other interrelated policies." It also reaffirms China's commitment to increasing the percentage of renewables in the country's energy mix to 10 per cent by 2010 up from the present seven per cent. China currently relies on coal to meet almost two-thirds of its energy needs and is projected to overtake the United States as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases within the next two years. The head of the NDRC, Ma Kai, however, stressed that Beijing rejected mandatory caps on emissions and saw the redressal of climate change as primarily a duty of the rich, industrialised countries. He said that global warming had been caused, for the most part, as a result of 200 years of unrestrained industrialisation by the West. Mandatory caps on developing countries, Mr. Ma said, would "hinder the development of developing countries and hamper their industrialisation." The report also stated that for China, the "first and overriding concern" was "economic and social development and poverty eradication." China's national strategy on global warming is the first such national programme announced by a developing country. It comes days before Chinese President Hu Jintao attends an expanded summit of the Group of Eight (G8) nations in Germany where climate change is expected to be one of the main foci of discussion. Global warming had, in fact, been in the international limelight all year.

MOGADISHU -- A suicide car bomber drove through a roadblock guarding the home of the Somali leader yesterday and while Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi was whisked to safety, at least seven people were killed in the explosion. A government spokesman blamed the assassination attempt on "terrorists linked to al-Qaida." PUTIN AIMS AT EUROPE ROME -- Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that U.S. plans to build a missile defence system in Eastern Europe would force Moscow to target its weapons against Europe. The threat, in an interview published yesterday in Italy's Corriere della Sera, marked one of his most strident statements to date against the U.S. plans for the Czech Republic and Poland. ACTIVISTS STILL IN JAIL BEIJING -- Eighteen years after the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests, at least 13 little-known Chinese are still behind bars for their roles in the pro-democracy movement, a human rights group said. Few details were known about the 13, beyond their names, the group added. At least three were convicted of "counter-revolutionary sabotage" and one of "counter-revolutionary assault". Seven are serving suspended death sentences and six are serving life, it said. The group said those still in jail, who it termed "political prisoners", should be released at once. "The government should allow open and independent investigation of the massacre, of cases in which people were allegedly tortured into confessions and of cases of wrongful imprisonment," it added. The square was quiet on Monday, full of the usual tour groups and people flying kites, but also some plainclothes security. In Hong Kong, tens of thousands of people were expected to turn out for a candle-lit vigil in the evening as they do every year. More than 120 members of a Hong Kong group supporting democracy in China did an 18-km (11-mile) run on Sunday to mark the anniversary. Key figures have been silenced at home or forced into exile abroad since 1989, but voices for reforms have mutated into a crusade involving a new generation of civil rights campaigners who have taken up the cudgels for the downtrodden. ISRAEL'S TIME UP: IRAN TEHRAN -- Iran's hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad yesterday said the world would witness the destruction of Israel soon, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Ahmadinejad said last summer's war between Israel and Hezbollah showed for the first time that the "hegemony of the occupier regime (Israel) had collapsed."

Lewis "Scooter" Libby will learn whether he will go to prison and, if so, whether it will be right away for his conviction in the CIA leak case. Once Libby's fate is known, then there is this ultimate question: Will President Bush pardon him? Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney and assistant to Bush, was convicted in March of lying and obstructing the investigation into the 2003 outing of CIA officer Valerie Plame. Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald is calling for Libby to spend up to three years in prison. Libby maintains his innocence. With the support of several current and former White House, State Department and Pentagon officials, he has asked U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton, not to send him to prison. Walton has a reputation as one of the district's strictest judges. Since Libby's conviction, the White House has sidestepped talk of pardoning Libby. Some of Libby's supporters have spoken publicly about a pardon, while Democrats are asking Bush to promise not to issue one. Bush said he is "pretty much going to stay out of" the case until the legal fight is over. That becomes harder to do if Walton sends Libby to prison. Bush will have to decide whether to pardon his former aide or let him serve his time. "If jail time is issued, I would hope the president would issue a pardon," said former Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., a member of Libby's legal defense fund. A pardon decision could be delayed, however, if Walton sentences Libby to prison but puts the sentence on hold. Normally, defendants are ordered to report to prison within weeks. But the law allows &mdash; and defense lawyers said they will ask &mdash; Walton to delay the sentence until appeals have run out. That could be many months, at the earliest, or even more than a year. Libby's lawyers say he should be given leniency because of his lengthy career in public service. They also note that nobody was charged with leaking Plame's identity and suggest that Libby should not be punished as if he was a leaker. "There is no evidence in the record here to support a finding that any underlying offense was actually committed by Mr. Libby or anyone else," his lawyers wrote. It is a common refrain in perjury cases, and one that points up a Washington truism: It usually is the cover-up that gets people in trouble. During the scandal that led to President Clinton's impeachment, while Democrats decried Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation as politics run amok, Republicans fell back on a familiar ground: "This case is not about sex," Nickles said in 1998. "This case is about perjury." Now Nickles and Libby's other supporters find themselves on the other side, railing against Fitzgerald's investigation. "I think he became so wrapped up in the case, he lost perspective and said, "I gotta get something for this. I gotta get a scalp," Nickles said recently. Fitzgerald knew early on that Libby was not the source of the newspaper article that first identified Plame, the wife of an outspoken war critic. But the prosecutor said he needed to know whether others in the government authorized that leak and he referred in court to "a cloud" over Cheney. "In short, Mr. Libby lied about nearly everything that mattered," Fitzgerald said in court documents. Nickles said it was unfair to draw comparisons with Clinton's scandal, which was "a different level of intensity." Nickles noted that Clinton was not convicted by the Senate and was spared prosecution in civilian court. It's also hard to compare Libby's case with other politically charged trials. Dwight L. Chapin, an aide to President Nixon, was convicted of two counts of perjury in 1973 and served six months in prison for lying to a federal grand jury investigating the Watergate scandal. Unlike Libby, Chapin was not convicted of obstruction. Nixon's domestic affairs adviser, John D. Ehrlichman, and chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, served 18 months of a four-year to eight-year term for obstruction of justice, conspiracy and perjury. Libby, however, was not charged with conspiracy. Domestic diva Martha Stewart, whose 2004 trial was far less political but no less publicized, was sentenced to five months prison for conspiracy, obstruction and making false statements for lying to investigators about a stock sale. Walton, who was nominated to the bench by Bush, has offered few clues about what type of sentence he is leaning toward. In a ruling last week, however, he indicated he did not view the conviction lightly. He received more than 150 letters in the case, which he said was evidence of the public's interest in the case and "the weightiness of the underlying charges."

Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., Barack Obama, D-Ill., and former North Carolina Democratic Sen. John Edwards sees 2008 as a turning point for faith-based progressives. "I think the 2008 election will be dramatically different from the 2004 election in relationship to issues of faith and values," the Rev. Jim Wallis told ABC News. "The Democratic front-runners are all people who are clearly more comfortable in church as people of faith -- relating their faith to politics -- than the top Republican front-runners."

Dems Battle Over War, Security Poll: Thompson Edges Past Romney Fred Thompson Offers 'Comeback Trail' Wallis is the author of "God's Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It" and the founder of Sojourners, the largest national network of progressive Christians. He describes himself in his writings as an advocate of a "new moral politics" that "transcends" the "old categories" of both the "secular left" and the "religious right." In an e-mail to supporters sent just hours before the start of his 7 p.m. EDT forum with the Democratic Party's top-three presidential contenders, Wallis wrote, "There are very few moments when we have the opportunity to turn the eyes of the nation away from the three-ring circus that our electoral process resembles and on to the concerns of those whom Jesus called the 'least of these.' Tonight is one of those moments." Rather than invite all eight Democratic presidential candidates to Monday's discussion at George Washington University, Wallis decided to limit the invitation list to Clinton, Obama and Edwards, in order to foster a "more thoughtful, deeper, reflective" conversation among those candidates who he thinks have a realistic chance of winning their party's nomination. "You can imagine the Democratic front-runners knowing the psalms in church, knowing when to clap at the right time and knowing what comes next in the service," Wallis told ABC News, "and the Republican front-runners kind of squirming awkwardly and, you know, not knowing the music and clapping at the wrong time, and looking at their watch to see when the service gets finished."

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This By JUDY DEMPSEY and Published: June 4, 2007 BERLIN, June 4 — President Bush flew to Europe today for talks with world leaders later this week, including President of Russia, in the wake of a threat by Mr. Putin to point Russian missiles at Europe if the United States builds its missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Skip to next paragraph China Releases Climate Change Plan News Analysis: Bush Climate Plan: Amid Nays, Some Maybes In an interview with journalists from the other big industrialized countries that was released on the Kremlin Web site, Mr. Putin set an uncompromising tone before the start of the group’s summit meeting in Germany on Wednesday. His comments set a challenge for Mr. Bush, who flew to Prague in the Czech Republic today before the meeting in Germany. The comments drew criticism from , which described Mr. Putin’s statements as “unhelpful and unwelcome.” Speaking in Washington today, the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said flatly that Russia’s concerns — and its threat to target European sites — would not lead the United States to cancel the missile program, and he rejected the idea that it could lead to a new arms race. “It’s just not helpful, certainly surprising,” Mr. McCormack said, referring to Mr. Putin’s comments. “They have more the ring of 1977 than they do 2007, so you know, I don’t know quite what to make of it.” Mr. Putin said Russia would not stand back and allow Washington to expand its nuclear potential in Europe, even though the new interceptors that the United States intends to deploy in Poland would not carry nuclear warheads. “Europe is being filled with new weapons,” Mr. Putin said, according to the transcript. “We ask ourselves what is going on.” He said the United States’ planned new installations would be an “inseparable part of the U.S. nuclear potential,” and said the Iranian missiles that America’s bases are intended to protect against “do not exist.” “If the American nuclear potential grows in European territory, we have to give ourselves new targets in Europe,” Mr. Putin was quoted as saying by Corriere della Sera, an Italian newspaper that took part in the interview. “It is up to our military to define these targets, in addition to defining the choice between ballistic and cruise missiles. But this is just a technical aspect.” Asked whether the American plan to build a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe would force Moscow to direct its own missiles against cities or American military targets in Europe, Mr. Putin replied, “Naturally, yes,” according to the newspaper. Der Spiegel, the German weekly newsmagazine, which also took part in the interview, reported that Mr. Putin had warned about the greater possibility of a nuclear conflict. There was little immediate international reaction to Mr. Putin’s criticisms. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who will host the Group of 8 meeting, wants to lower tensions ahead of the discussions, German diplomats and advisers said. But NATO criticized Mr. Putin’s comments. “These kind of comments are unhelpful and unwelcome,” James Appathurai, a spokesman for NATO, said. The differences over America’s plans for the missile shield are likely to dominate the talks in Europe. Ms. Merkel and Group of 8 leaders from Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and the United States had been hoping that their meeting could reach a consensus over a separate issue, the future status of Kosovo, one of the last unresolved conflicts of the Balkan wars of the 1990s. has drawn up a plan that would pave the way for Kosovo to become independent from Serbia, ending the province’s status as a United Nations international protectorate. This arrangement has been in place since 1999. That independence would be supervised by the But Russia, which has veto power as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , made it clear last week in Potsdam, Germany, at a meeting of Group of 8 foreign ministers that it did not accept the plan and instead wanted a resumption of talks between Serbia and Kosovo. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, used that meeting to sharply criticize the United States and the missile defense plan. European diplomats said Mr. Putin’s blunt remarks were intended not only to sow divisions in Europe over the American missile defense plans but also to try to extract concessions over Kosovo. In Germany, Ms. Merkel’s partners in the coalition government, the Social Democrats, oppose the American plan and have even suggested that Germany pursue a policy of “equal distance” between Russia and the United States. But Ms. Merkel, the conservative leader of the Christian Democrats, has challenged Mr. Putin on several issues, including his views about the missile defense system. Ms. Merkel has personally told Mr. Putin that America’s plans are in no way directed against Russia. American officials have also repeatedly told Mr. Putin that Russia would be informed of every step along the way and could even visit the sites in Poland, where the interceptors would be based, and in the Czech Republic, where the United States plans to deploy the radar system. Russia, however, has not taken up the offer of visiting the sites. Mr. Putin is due to visit the United States for talks with Mr. Bush on July 1 and 2.

The investigation was touched off by a complaint from a woman who said she was defrauded after investing in a Western African technology project championed by Jefferson. FBI searches Jefferson's homes in Washington and New Orleans. Agents confiscate files and find $90,000 in cash in a freezer. Former Jefferson aide Brett M. Pfeffer pleads guilty to bribery charges. Kentucky businessman Vernon Jackson pleads guilty to paying more than $400,000 in bribes to a congressman identified by federal sources as Jefferson. House ethics committee announces an investigation of Jefferson's activities and appoints a subcommittee to carry it out. FBI agents raid Jefferson's congressional offices, drawing protests from Republican and Democratic House leaders. The search leads to a court challenge that is still pending. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, then the House minority leader, urges House Democrats to vote Jefferson off the House Ways and Means Committee. They agree on a 99-58 vote. Jefferson is forced into a runoff after winning 30 percent of the vote against 12 other candidates. U.S. Court of Appeals rules Justice Department can immediately begin examining documents seized from Jefferson's office that aren't challenged by his attorney. Court delays decision on disputed documents. Jefferson defeats state Rep. Karen Carter, a Democrat, in runoff election, 57 percent to 43 percent. Pelosi refuses to return Jefferson to his seat on the Ways and Means Committee. Assigns him to the Small Business Committee instead. Jefferson is sworn in to his ninth term. A 16-count indictment accuses Jefferson of a pervasive pattern of bribery and corruption and using his office to enrich himself and his family. Jefferson indicted in bribery probe By USA TODAY staff WASHINGTON &#151; Rep. William Jefferson, a Louisiana congressman who garnered nationwide attention after the FBI seized $90,000 from his home freezer in 2005, was named Monday in a 16-count indictment involving elaborate schemes to solicit bribes and hide the proceeds. The congressman is charged with racketeering, soliciting bribes, wire fraud, money-laundering, obstruction of justice, conspiracy and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He allegedly solicited bribes for himself and his family, bribed a Nigerian government official and set up a shell company to help hide the money, law enforcement officials said at a news conference. Jefferson, 63, was involved in "a pervasive pattern of fraud, bribery and corruption that spanned many years and two continents," said Chuck Rosenberg, U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia. "The schemes charged are complex. The alleged criminal behavior is spread over time and distance, but the essence of the charges in this case are really rather simple," said Rosenberg. "Mr. Jefferson corruptly traded on his good office and on the Congress, where he served as a member of the United States House of Representatives, to enrich himself and his family through a pervasive pattern of fraud, bribery and corruption that spanned many years and two continents." Jefferson, in Louisiana on Monday, could not immediately be reached for comment. His lawyer was planning a late afternoon news conference. Two of Jefferson's alleged associates have reached plea bargains with prosecutors and have been sentenced. Former congressional aide Brett Pfeffer said he solicited bribes on Jefferson's behalf and was sentenced to eight years in prison. Former Louisville telecommunications executive Vernon Jackson pleaded guilty in May 2006 to paying $400,000 to $1 million in bribes to Jefferson in exchange for his assistance securing business deals in Nigeria and other African nations. Jackson was sentenced to more than seven years in prison. Both Pfeffer and Jackson agreed to cooperate in the case against Jefferson in exchange for their pleas. "If convicted, we will also seek the forfeiture of hundreds of thousands of dollars that Mr. Jefferson obtained through fraud and by his corrupt acts," Rosenberg said. The congressman, whose district includes New Orleans, was re-elected to a ninth term last December despite widespread reports that he was under investigation. In an affidavit sworn out in late May 2006 to obtain a search warrant for the congressman's office, the FBI describes Jefferson retrieving a briefcase filled with $100,000 from a car parked outside the Ritz-Carlton in Arlington, Va. An unnamed witness who is an investigator in iGate, a Kentucky telecommunications firm, alleged Jefferson planned to use the money to coax African officials into deals. Four days later, the FBI raided Jefferson's homes in New Orleans and Washington. The FBI found $90,000 of the cash, which was marked and wrapped in foil in his Washington freezer. The May 20, 2006, raid on his Capitol Hill offices was criticized by leaders of both political parties, who said it was a violation of the constitutional separation of powers. Its legality is being appealed. The impact of the case has stretched across continents and even roiled presidential politics in Nigeria. According to court records, Jefferson told associates he needed cash to pay bribes to the country's vice president, Atiku Abubakar. Abubakar denied the allegations, which figured prominently in that country's presidential elections in April. He ran for the presidency and finished third. The indictment does not name Abubakar. But it describes Jefferson's dealings with an unnamed "Nigerian Official A" who was a high-ranking official in Nigeria's executive branch who had a spouse in Potomac, Md. One of Abubakar's wives lived in that Washington suburb. Contributing: Donna Leinwand in Washington; Randy Lilleston in McLean, Va.; the Associated Press.

The indictment is 94 pages long and lists 16 alleged violations of federal law that could keep Jefferson in prison for up to 235 years.

Brunskill - AHN News Writer Freetown, Sierra Leone (AHN) - Twenty-two people died in a helicopter crash in Sierra Leone late Sunday, the majority of them Togolese sports officials and fans, government officials said Monday. A committee has been set up to investigate what caused the crash, Sierra Leone Vice President Solomon Berewa's office said in a statement. None of the members of the football team were on board the Russian-made Mi-8 helicopter, which burst into flames as it was landing at Lungi airport. One of the pilots was the only survivor, but he is said to be in critical condition. The passengers on board the helicopter were returning to the airport after watching a football match. Togo's Sports Minister Richard Attipoe was among the dead, along with a flight engineer, a female journalist and members of both the Togolese Sports Ministry and Football Federation. BBC quotes Chernor Ojuku Sesay of the Sierra Leone Football Association as saying, "From what we hear, most of the victims were burnt beyond recognition." On Monday the Togolese government declared three days of national mourning, and sports fans could be seen wearing black armbands in Freetown. Copyright © AHN Media Corp - All rights reserved.

Six soldiers and two civilians were also wounded at Ain al-Hilweh camp, hospital sources said on Monday. Shortly after calm was restored, a bomb detonated in east Beirut, injuring seven people. Two soldiers and two fighters were killed in the fighting in the south and the army has accused Jund al-Sham (Soldiers of the Levant) of firing rocket-propelled grenades at one of its checkpoints in the city of Sidon. Fighting has also continued at the Nahr al-Bared camp in north Lebanon. Witnesses said fighters of the group had been involved in clashes with Lebanese troops three times since Sunday night. Munir Maqdah, Fatah's military leader in Lebanon, said the fighting at Ain al-Hilweh had ceased and that the situation was "completely calm". As the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp, the siege continued into Monday evening, and a bomb exploded in Christian east , injuring seven bystanders, a senior security official said. Reports said the bomb exploded on an empty bus close to a commercial centre and a church in the residential and industrial Bouchrieh suburb. A series of bombings has occurred in and around since clashes between Fatah al-Islam fighters and Lebanese army forces began on May 20. Exclusive video of Ain al-Hilweh camp in southern Lebanon , troops resumed pounding the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp near Tripoli around 9am local time (0600 GMT) on Monday, targeting fighters from the Fatah al-Islam group holed up inside. Fifteen days into the seige, Fatah al-Islam has refused to give up its weapons or surrender and is putting up stiff resistance. Since Friday, the army had conducted an intensive assault on the group's positions at the camp's entrances with the aim of wiping out the group. John Cookson, Al Jazeera's correspondent at Nahr al-Bared, said the Lebanese army called Monday's attack the "final stages" of its assault on the camp. Cookson said the attacks "come in waves". He said: "Secret Lebanese security forces are inside the camp, electronically painting buildings they believe fighters are in. It takes hours, or even a day or so to get the guns lined up." A 1969 agreement prevents the army from entering Lebanon's 12 Palestinian camps. The violence, which erupted on May 20, is Lebanon's worst internal fighting since the 1975-1990 civil war. At least 113 people have died and about 25,000 of Nahr al-Bared's 40,000 refugees have fled due to worsening humanitarian conditions. "The Palestinian refugees are not being treated properly by Lebanon" Send us your views The fighting has raised concerns that the violence could spread to more of Lebanon's 12 refugee camps, which hold more than 200,000 Palestinians mostly in conditions of abject poverty. Mike Hanna, Al Jazeera's correspondent at the camp, said a senior Lebanese army intelligence source informed him that there has been intense communication between Jund al-Sham in the south and Fatah al-Islam in the north, as well as a couple of other armed groups. The intelligence source said this communication indicates the attacks are co-ordinated and not random. speaking to Al Jazeera from Ain al-Hilweh, said a meeting between members of the mainstream Palestinian factions in the camp - of which Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah is the most powerful - and the Lebanese army aimed to broker a lasting ceasefire and to " re-organise the distribution of checkpoints in the area" He said: "[The group] Usbat al-Ansar has pledged to control Jund al-Sham members. It is supported by all Palestinian political forces in the camp in order to control the situation. "An extended meeting will be held with the forces in the camp in order to set the mechanism to avoid other such incidents. We will try to form a field security force where all parties in Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp take part. Maqdah also said that Fatah was taking security measures inside Ain al-Hilweh to prevent the conflict from expanding.

NewsTerp - jhebert_at_cs washington edu Mon, Jun 4 2007 Weiner Tries Once Again For Helicopter Ban Over Manhattan Congressman Accused of "Trying To Beat Up" Helo Tourism Industry He's at it again. New York Congressman Anthony Weiner appears ready to re-introduce legislation that would "close key loopholes in the helicopter homeland security safety net" by requiring helicopters to fly over water only while in Manhattan airspace. The bill, originally introduced and killed in 2004, would exempt take-offs and landings and "police, medical and other authorized helicopter traffic" as well as requiring the all passengers and baggage be screened by the Transportation Security Administration. It also stipulates helicopters remain in contact with the FAA regarding their flight path, regardless of altitude. "Treating small airplanes just as seriously as we do jumbo jets is a welcome change, but it's only half the job," said Weiner. "History, known intelligence reports and common sense show the need for tighter regulations to secure the skies around Manhattan. It's not just a matter of safety for pilots and passengers, but also of security for citizens on the ground," according to the New York Press. At a press conference in New York Saturday, Weiner said, "We are taking a common-sense step to make New York safer. Right now it is completely legal [for helicopters] to hover over buildings in Manhattan - that's what we are trying to ban." Michael Roth, a helicopter charter owner, points out his helicopter never hover over buildings, according to the New York Daily News. "He's pretty much trying to beat up on the helicopter tourism industry," he said. "I am concerned about helicopters flying over a densely populated city," Weiner said. "I think it's dangerous, and I think it poses a threat." One has to wonder what New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has to say about all this, considering he's a helicopter pilot and flies himself around the city. The mayor may be trying to find just the right words... as there have been no reports of a response as of yet.

Clinton, Obama Originally published June 4, 2007 Jockeying for advantage in the first primary state, former Sen. took on the Democratic front-runners over the war in Iraq in a sometimes contentious presidential debate last night. In a spirited exchange on the pre-eminent issue of the Democratic campaign, Edwards criticized Sens. for "quietly" casting last-minute votes last month against an emergency funding measure for the war in Iraq. He contrasted their silence with the decision of another contender, Connecticut Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, to speak out against continued funding. "There is a difference between leadership and legislating," said Edwards, who trails Clinton and Obama, according to national polling, which also shows that Democratic primary voters strongly favor a U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq. Obama shot back aggressively, pointing to Edwards' 2002 vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq. "John, the fact is that I opposed this war from the start. So you're about 4 1/2 years late on leadership on this issue," said Obama, who was under pressure to improve his performance after stumbling in the first debate in April. "I think it's important not to play politics on something that is as critical and as difficult as this." The two-hour forum, held in a hockey rink on the campus of St. Anselm College, was the second of the Democratic campaign. It was carried on WMUR, the state's dominant TV station, and CNN, whose cameras repeatedly tried to isolate the leading candidates from those in the so-called "second tier." In addition to the war, the eight candidates addressed a wide range of questions, including the recent immigration deal in Congress, health care, terrorism, gays in the military, genocide in Darfur, same-sex marriage and Bill Clinton's role in the next administration, regardless of who wins. Most of the Democrats stressed the importance of repairing America's global reputation and restoring the nation's reputation for morality in its dealings with other countries. Sen. Clinton, who faced renewed questioning during the debate about her 2002 vote, said the differences among the Democratic candidates, all of whom oppose the war, "are minor" - a point that Edwards disputed. "The differences between us and the Republicans are major, and I don't want anybody in America to be confused," Clinton said. In what could be read as a swipe at Edwards' decision to quit the Senate after one term representing North Carolina, Clinton said that Democrats, "by speaking out from the outside or working and casting votes that actually make a difference from the inside, we are trying to end the war." Of the candidates now in Congress, only Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware voted to provide emergency funding for the war. Biden said that "as long as there is a single troop in Iraq ... I cannot and will not vote not to fund them." Obama, an Illinois senator who had supported war funding up to last month, called his change of position a vote against "a continuation of a plan that has not worked." Clinton's recent vote against war funding has highlighted her shift on Iraq and raised questions about whether she is "playing politics" on the issue, as debate moderator Wolf Blitzer of CNN noted. Addressing a point of concern to anti-war activists, among others, Clinton acknowledged that she did not read a key National Intelligence Estimate about Iraq before deciding to support President Bush's request for an authorization from Congress to remove Saddam Hussein by force if necessary. Clinton, a senator from New York, said she had been "thoroughly briefed" about intelligence on Iraq and tried to dismiss the question as part of an argument "about the past." Edwards, who also said he read only a summary of the 90-page intelligence report, said he "had the information I needed." He then repeated his assertion, which Clinton has declined to echo, that his vote for the war was "wrong." However, Obama, who opposed the war from the outset as a state legislator, noted that Democratic Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, then the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called the NIE a factor in his decision to oppose the war resolution, "so obviously there was some pertinent information there." of Alaska said that all those who voted to authorize force against Iraq should be disqualified from serving as president, because "they don't have moral judgment." Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, who has the most consistent anti-war record in the field, said he would not use a Hellfire missile to kill Osama bin Laden, if U.S intelligence located him, because assassination should not be used as a tool. and Edwards raised their hands when asked if the United States should consider boycotting the 2008 Olympics in Beijing as a way of pressuring China to take action against the government of Sudan, a major Chinese oil supplier, to end the genocide in Darfur. At several points, the candidates pushed back against the questions, attempting to turn the public's anti-news media attitudes to their advantage. Obama drew applause by calling a question about making English the official language of the U.S. divisive and "a disservice to the American people." "We're not going to engage in these hypotheticals," Clinton said at another point, drawing applause from several fellow candidates, as well as the crowd. According to the latest New Hampshire polling, Clinton is the front-runner, as she is nationally. Obama and Edwards are the only candidates to break into double digits, though Richardson's support in the state appears to have grown and he is currently running fourth here. Tomorrow night, 10 Republican presidential candidates will take the same stage for their third debate of the campaign. A likely 11th contender, former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, who formed a committee last week allowing him to raise money and pay staff, will not be participating. , front-runners in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Times) The Fix (Washington Post) Powered by MT Blogroll Global War on Terror &laquo; Swamp TV reports on Democratic debate President Bush in the bubble &raquo; McCain hopes rivals don't play 'politics' on immigration Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) kept up his line of attack today against fellow Republicans who oppose the immigration compromise before the Senate, especially his fellow presidential candidates like Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney who have criticized the legislation though he didn't mention them by name. before the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, clearly an immigration-friendly audience, McCain said he hoped some of his rivals didn't have crass political motives in opposing the bill. Of course by saying this, he wanted to raise the possibility in voters' minds that this was exactly what his opponents had in mind. Thus McCain could take the high ground as the rock-ribbed patriot concerned about his country and willing to stand on principle even if it's unpopular while raising the prospect that his opponents were tawdry politicians unfit to hold the nation's highest offiice. It is a hard problem, and I understand that. But the choice is between doing something, imperfect but effective and achievable, and doing nothing. I would hope that any candidate for President would not suggest doing nothing. And I would hope they wouldn't play politics for their own interests if the cost of their ambition was to make this problem even harder to solve. To want the office so badly that you would intentionally make our country's problems worse might prove you can read a poll or take a cheap shot, but it hardly demonstrates presidential leadership. We can expect to hear a similar message from McCain tomorrow night at the Republican debate in New Hampshire to be carried on CNN. Posted by Frank James on June 4, 2007 11:57 AM McCain is as likely as the rest of them to make our country's problems worse just to get into office. Posted by: Cheryl | June 4, 2007 1:58 PM Reason why we have open borders and the fight for amnesty: Posted by: Debrar | June 4, 2007 2:27 PM How many years did McCain wear the uniform of the United States? And how many years did he spend as a POW in North Vietnam because he chose to defend those things the uniform represents? The Senate amnesty bill (S.1348) is a cruel hoax against the American people because it is deliberately written so that its enforcement measures will never be implemented. It also means another 200,000 foreign workers brought in each year to compete with the 23 million low-skilled workers that are rightfully theirs. Instead of pushing this legislation that is a stake aimed at the heart of our national sovereignty, McCain should back the American Legion's May 10 resolution condemning any form of amnesty and supporting the strategy of Attrition Through Enforcement and Self-Deportation that we know works. Midwest Coalition to Reduce Immigration June 4, 2007 2:51 PM Who is going to deport the temporary worker out when their time has expired and they can't find them? They don't do it now. Who is going to deport the temporary worker out when the temporary has a "Baby" born on US soil? That needs to be addressed, just in case this bill goes through. Does the Congress & the White House believe we're that stupid! Posted by: PG | June 4, 2007 4:19 PM Why pass any law that is so complicated it will never be enforced just so you pass something. Stupid. Just enforce our current laws and stop encouraging more illegal immigrants. They will go back on their own if they cannot find work because their employers are fined.

The crash killed a total of 23 people, including 20 Togolese soccer officials flying from Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, to the local international airport following a soccer match between Sierra Leone and Togo, which Togo won 1-0. The flight normally takes seven minutes. "Twenty-three people were onboard, including three crewmembers," Anatoly Maleshov, head of the embassy's consular department, said. "The information concerning the deaths of Russian pilot Alexander Khovaiko and Moldovan pilot Vyacheslav Zaitsev has been confirmed." Maleshov said the only survivor, Russian crew commander Sergei Perlakov, was in hospital. The Reuters news agency quoted local officials as saying Togolese Sports Minister Richard Attipoe, chief of the national soccer delegation, was also one of the crash victims. No soccer players were onboard the helicopter, which belonged to Paramount Airlines. The company operates flights between Freetown and the international airport of Sierra Leone, divided by a river. The cause of the crash is being investigated. Preliminary reports suggest the helicopter could have burst into flames in the air.

But the atmosphere on the historic square was in most ways no different than any other day. A free-of charge favourite with tourists, cameras flashed during the raising of a Chinese flag by honour guards - a daily ceremony unrelated to the anniversary of the bloodshed. Hundreds, if not thousands were killed as Chinese troops and tanks broke up a seven-week demonstration of the ''Student Democracy Movement'' in Beijing on June 4, 1989, according to accounts of journalists, activists and other eyewitnesses. Information about the incident is heavily censored in China and many people from outside Beijing - particularly the young - still don't know what happened on this day 18 years ago. China's government, which called the protest a counter-revolutionary riot, has yet to fully disclose what happened, and to this day, the former British colony Hong Kong continues to be the only city in China where a large-scale Tiananmen commemoration event is held in public. At the time, many Hong Kongers were horrified by the bloodshed - with only a few years to go before the handover to Chinese rule in 1997, and thousands of people marched in the streets protesting the military action. On Monday, people planned to hold candles and sing commemorative songs in Victoria Park in Hong Kong in an annual ceremony to commemorate those who lost their lives in the bloodshed.

The pilot and two passengers suffered minor injuries. No one on the ground was hurt, said Ian Gregor, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. The plane came to rest atop a garage without catching a fire. Its wing rested on the roof of another home. The Piper Seneca was approaching Cable Airport when it lost power and crashed into three homes on Blossom Circle. The plane departed from Van Nuys Airport in the San Fernando Valley. "They were on approach when the pilot reported engine problems," Gregor said. Weather didn't appear to be a factor. It was sunny with no clouds or fog. Upland is about 45 miles east of Los Angeles, near the junction of Interstates 10 and 15, in San Bernardino County. Cable Airport, described as "The World's Largest Family-Owned, Public-Use Airport" on its Web site, occupies 105 acres and is home to more than 450 aircraft. It opened as Cable-Claremont Airport in 1946 and is operated by the Cable family. Housing tracts surround the small airport. A plane crashed into a home in nearby Claremont on Dec. 14, 2003, killing the pilot. Federal safety investigators concluded last week that pilot Steven Kaplan, 45, became disoriented and lost control of his Cessna while approaching the airport. .

Monday, Jun. 04, 2007 Former Bush White House aide Lewis "Scooter" Libby exits the U.S. Federal Courthouse after he was convicted of four federal crimes at the U.S. Federal Courthouse in Washington, March 6, 2007. Jim Bourg / Reuters When United States District Judge Reggie Walton sentences I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby Tuesday for perjury and obstruction of justice, watch how he handles one of the most troubling aspects of federal sentencing law: allowing a harsher sentence for a crime that was never proven. How Libby's Trial Hurt the Press On the eve of Scooter Libby's sentencing, the damage from a troubling prosecution has already been done &#151; to journalists and the public interest Will Bush Pardon Libby? The President has never been forthcoming with pardons, but he may at least leave the door open for Scooter Libby Why Libby's Defense Failed Lawyers for the former White House aide, convicted for his role in the Valerie Plame affair, couldn't deliver on their promises Libby: Fall of a Vulcan How a very smart and very loyal aide to Dick Cheney got indicted for allegedly lying about his role in defending the war In case you forgot, a jury convicted Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney’s former chief of staff, in March of lying to federal investigators about leaking the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame. The leak was the thing for most Americans, the crux of an apparent White House campaign to discredit Plame’s husband, Joseph Wilson, who wrote a 2003 op-ed piece debunking WMD justifications for the Iraq war. But while outing a CIA agent can be illegal, neither Libby nor anyone else was actually charged with doing that to Plame. In fact, pre-trial maneuvering found the prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, insisting that this was not a case about a leak and fighting defense requests for documents about whether Plame was ever a covert agent, a status that could have made intentionally leaking her identity a crime. Thanks to Fitzgerald’s brief advocating a stiff sentence for Libby, we found out last week that the CIA did indeed consider Plame’s identity classified, at least for 18 months. The prosecutor has brought this up now in apparent support of a remarkable claim: Libby should serve 30 to 37 months in prison—about twice what the federal probation office recommends and way more than the probation favored by the defense—because the underlying (and uncharged) crime was so serious. How can a crime that may never have happened &#151; and that at one point the prosecutor argued was largely irrelevant to the case &#151; now increase a criminal sentence? It’s part of the magic of the federal sentencing guidelines, which were mandatory until two years ago. The controversial rules prescribe penalties that can be raised or lowered within a range, depending on various factors. One factor in a perjury case is the severity of the crime originally being investigated. It’s part of a general category of enhancements &#151; from particularly depraved conduct to the use of a weapon &#151; that can, depending on the crime, increase a sentence if the judge determines by a preponderance of the evidence (the law’s lowest level of proof) that they happened. To get a sense of the absurdity of this, think of someone found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt—the highest level of proof—of dealing 20 grams of cocaine, and the judge saying, hey, there’s evidence that you dealt 10 times that amount, so you get an extra eight years. The U.S. Supreme Court is well aware that enhancing sentences this way can be unfair, and the justices have struggled with it since 2000. That’s when the court ruled 5-4 in Apprendi v. New Jersey that a New Jersey man’s 10-year sentence (the maximum under state law) for shooting at a black neighbor’s house could not be increased by two years just because the judge believed the crime was racially motivated. Unless the facts leading to the sentence are determined by a jury (or admitted to in a guilty plea), the court said, a judge required to impose a sentence longer than “the prescribed statutory maximum” violates the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. The Supreme Court returned to the issue four years later in Blakely v. Washington. This time, the justices decided, also by a 5-4 vote, that Washington state’s sentencing rules violated a kidnapper’s Sixth Amendment right. Since the judge determined that the kidnapper had acted with “deliberate cruelty,” the rules allowed the judge to add 37 months to the 53-month sentence. Even though 53 months was far below the “statutory maximum” of 10 years, the sentence was still unconstitutional, a conclusion that suggested the federal guidelines, which operated in a similar way, were in jeopardy. In January 2005, the high court finally gave an answer: enhancements required by the federal guidelines also violate the right to a jury trial, but the constitutional fix is to make the guidelines optional. So a judge can use his traditional discretion to determine sentences, while consulting the guidelines, and so long as the sentences are reasonable, they won’t violate the Sixth Amendment. This is the law that Judge Walton will operate under Tuesday. He must review the guidelines, and if he believes that Libby’s lies hid a probable violation of the law against outing covert agents, he can bump up the sentence to 30 months or more. The betting here is that he won’t. It would give too much weight to a mere suspicion. Still, the case is too high-profile for probation, so look for a sentence in the neighborhood of the 15 months suggested by the probation department’s report. And don’t expect Libby to be free on bond pending appeal. Federal judges usually don’t allow that unless the bases for appeal are strong, and they don’t seem to be in this case.

Mr Putin: Threat of new Cold War He has threatened to return his country to its Cold War stance and has talked about the possibility - accidental or deliberate - of a nuclear war. His comments come just before this week's G8 meeting of world leaders in Germany. The US wants to place interceptor rockets on standby in Poland and set up a radar base in the Czech Republic. "If a new missile defence system will be deployed in Europe, then we need to warn you today that we will come with a response," Mr Putin told The Times. "We have to ensure our security and we are not the initiator of this process." Mr Putin warned that the US deployment raised the propsect of accidental, or deliberate, nuclear war in Europe. "We understand that the system of missile defence on the one side, and the absence of such a system on the other creates the illusion of being protected, and increases the possibility of unleashing a nuclear conflict," the Russian leader said. Iran calls US plans a 'joke' Washington says it needs a missile shield to protect against an attack from the likes of North Korea and Iran. But Mr Putin said Iran, which is striving to achieve nuclear status, did not have weapons that could threaten the US. "There are no such missiles - Iran does not have missiles with the range," the President said. Iran's top security official Ali Larijani said Washington's plans are "the joke of the year," adding: "The range of Iran's missiles doesn't reach Europe at all." Mr Putin and US President George Bush will come face to face at the G8 summit in Germany this week in what is likely to be a frosty encounter.

The lawyers, representing about 6,000 relatives of the victims of Srebrenica, have announced they will sue the Dutch state and the United Nations on Monday, whom they blame in part for allowing the killings to happen. During the 1992-95 Bosnian war, Srebrenica was declared a safe area and guarded by a Dutch army unit serving as part of a larger U.N. force in Bosnia. The lightly armed Dutch soldiers, lacking air support and under fire, were forced to abandon the enclave to Bosnian Serb forces, who took away and massacred Muslim men and boys who had relied on the protection of the Dutch troops. "Shortly before the fall of the safe area air support was obstructed by the Netherlands itself," lawyers Axel Hagedorn and Marco Gerritsen of Dutch firm Van Diepen Van der Kroef said in the writ of summons to be filed at the district court of The Hague and made available to Reuters. A spokesman for the office of Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said on Friday the Dutch state would not comment until it had received the legal documents. Families of Srebrenica victims , who have been dismayed by the failure of the two fugitive chief suspects to be brought to justice, are seeking recognition and redress for this tragedy. Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and former Bosnian Serb Army chief Ratko Mladic are wanted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague on genocide charges. The Dutch state has always said its troops were abandoned by the U.N. which gave them no air support, but public documents show a network of Dutch military officials within the U.N. Protection Force blocked air support because they feared their soldiers could be hit by friendly fire, the lawyers said. "This 'Dutch line' ... maintained close contact with The Hague, breaching U.N. command and control," Hagedorn told Reuters in an interview. "It is a wrong idea that the Dutch soldiers were let down by the United Nations," Gerritsen added. "It was a decision by high ranking Dutch officers together with the Dutch state to see that requests for air support were denied." Air support could have contained the Bosnian Serb forces and halted their advance, the lawyers said. After requests for air support were initially granted by U.N officials the Dutch state did everything in its power to reverse this approval. So it was not a U.N. decision but a decision initiated by the Dutch state, Gerritsen said. The lawyer, who also plans to call former U.N. Secretary Generals Boutros Boutros-Ghali and Kofi Annan as witnesses to the court, argues that the U.N. is to blame for not trying to convince the Dutch that air support could not be recalled. The Dutch government led by Wim Kok resigned in 2002 after a report on the massacre blamed politicians for sending the Dutch U.N. troops on an impossible mission. However attempts by the families to seek compensation from the Dutch government were refused as the government denied any question of liability, the lawyers said, adding the U.N. had also failed to respond to the families. news is provided by Zoom to full size map New UN database to help combat wildlife crime FACTBOX-What is the Kyoto Protocol?

Bush and Putin will see each other at the annual summit of industrialized nations, beginning Wednesday at the Baltic Sea resort city of Heiligendamm, Germany. In a diplomatic poke in the eye at Putin, Bush bracketed the summit with stops in the Czech Republic and Poland &mdash; the two countries where the United States wants to build a missile defense system for Europe. Already complaining of being encircled by NATO's expansion, Putin said putting missile defenses on Russia's doorstep would ignite a new arms race. He threatened to retarget Russia's missiles toward Europe. Bush says the anti-missile program is intended to protect Europe from states like Iran and North Korea, but Putin said neither country possesses the rockets the American system is intended to shoot down. "It's a defense against something which does not exist," the Russian president said. "It would be funny if it was not so sad." Flying to Europe with Bush, National Security Adviser Steve Hadley reacted cautiously to Putin. "There has been some escalation in the rhetoric," he said. "We think that is not helpful. We would like to have a constructive dialogue with Russia on this issue. We have in the past." Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urged Putin to cool down. "This isn't the Soviet Union and we need to drop the rhetoric that sounds like what the United States and the Soviet Union used to say about each other and realize it is the United States and Russia in a very different period," Rice said on the way to an Organization of American States meeting in Panama City, Panama. "It doesn't really help anybody to start threatening the Europeans," she said. "You cannot launch a threat at Europe that is separable from the United States." Bush and his wife, Laura, arrived late Monday evening. In his only address of an eight-day trip through six countries, Bush will make a speech on Tuesday about supporting global democratic aspirations. Hadley said Russia, accused of backpedaling on democracy, would come up in that speech because "there are no exceptions to the freedom agenda." "So obviously when we look for the progress of freedom and democracy we look for the progress of freedom and democracy in Russia and China," Hadley said. Putin's sharp words at Washington &mdash; and Britain, as well &mdash; set an unusually chilly tone for the three-day summit in Heiligendamm. Leaders of the eight participating countries &mdash; the United States, Britain, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan &mdash; typically mask their differences in statements that have been watered down to find consensus. "The most interesting issue on the agenda, to me, is Russia and how the other seven will handle Mr. Putin, who is really the elephant in the room," said Simon Serfaty, a senior adviser to the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Aside from his sharp words at Washington, Putin also took a slap at Britain for seeking the extradition of a Russian businessman who is a suspect in the killing of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko. Putin called London's move "stupidity." German Chancellor Angela Merkel also had a run-in with Putin last month, criticizing Russia's crackdown on political opponents. In interviews before the trip, Bush called Putin "my friend" but said the U.S.-Russian relationship was complicated. "Vladimir Putin will tell me that Russia is a democracy and that he's advancing democracy," Bush said. "We have got some questions about that, of course." There is a growing list of irritants in the U.S.-Russian relationship. Russia is unhappy about a U.S.-backed bid for independence for Kosovo. The United States wants Putin to do more to press Iran to abandon its suspected nuclear weapons program. Seeking a better footing in the relationship, Putin has accepted Bush's invitation for a July 1-2 meeting at his family's compound in Kennebunkport, Maine. Bush was expected to face pressure in Heiligendamm over what is widely perceived as U.S. footdragging in combatting global warming. But the president tried to pre-empt critics with his proposal last week challenging major polluting countries to agree on a target for reducing greenhouse gases. Still, Bush's proposal to let each country decide how much to do leaves a gap between Washington on one side and Merkel and the European Union on the other. Merkel had hoped that concrete goals to reduce emissions would be a centerpiece of her leadership of the G-8. Hadley gave Merkel a diplomatic nudge to support Bush's stand. "It's not about upstaging Angela Merkel. Quite the contrary," Hadley said. "It is not an alternative to anybody's plan, but it is an effort to identify a way forward and, quite frankly, it's an opportunity for Angela Merkel to preside over a very successful G-8." Along with his stops in Prague, Poland and Heiligendamm, Bush will visit Italy, Albania and Bulgaria.

Robyn Beck / AFP / Getty In what his campaign billed as a major address on immigration today in Miami, Sen. John McCain reiterated his support for the controversial legislation currently before Congress that has caused some conservatives to turn their backs on the former front-runner for the G.O.P. nomination. In an exclusive interview with TIME, McCain acknowledged that his support of the bill, which is backed by President Bush, has hurt him with the Republican base and could end his quest for the nomination. But he told TIME: "It would be worth it, because it's a matter of national security, it's a matter of economic security, and it's a matter of what kind of nation we are." McCain and Romney's War of Words Their immigration bill debate shows the candidates' different characters: hard-nosed dealmaker vs. smooth operator Immigration Reform: Still a Band-Aid Viewpoint: The latest deal on immigration policy addresses some of the problems &#151; but won't change much In his speech to a meeting of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, McCain went beyond the issue of whether the legislation grants "amnesty" to illegal aliens &#151; the focus of most of the conversative complaints &#151; and stressed what he called the "humanitarian" reasons for reform. What critics deride as a "special path" to citizenship, he said in his speech, is special only in the sense that "it is harder, longer and more expensive than the path offered to those immigrants who come here legally." The Senator also went to unusual lengths to sympathetically portray the yearning for a better life among immigrants. In emotional terms he described the deaths suffered by those attempting to cross "the trackless deserts of Arizona, people who broke our laws, not to harm us, but to possess for themselves the ideals and opportunities cherished here." While polls suggest that a slim majority of Republican voters support the immigration bill, opposition to its provision allowing citizenship has draw many attacks from conservatives within the party. Last week, President Bush dismissed opponents of the bill as "spreading fear," provoking sharp responses from typically reliable Administration allies such as Rush Limbaugh (who told his listeners the President stood to "lose some of you"). "I wish we could raise the level of dialogue on this issue," McCain told TIME. McCain's defiant speech could further inflame this divisive conversation. The Washington that the Republican National Committee has seen its small-donor contributions fall 40% since the immigration debate began in earnest last month, and that staffers link the decline directly to the issue: "Every donor in 50 states we reached has been angry, especially in the last month and a half, and for 99% of them immigration is the No. 1 issue." McCain, a co-author of the compromise legislation, is alone among the front-runners for the G.O.P. nomination who supports it. In his speech, McCain took a careful shot at his fellow candidates critical of the measure, asserting that those who reject his compromise, "especially if they are a candidate for President... should have the responsibility and courage to propose another way." He added pointedly: "To want the office so badly that you would intentionally make our country's problems worse might prove you can read a poll or take a cheap shot, but it hardly demonstrates presidential leadership." This jab was in keeping with the particularly feisty attitude that the McCain campaign has shown lately. He recently criticized fellow G.O.P. candidate Mitt Romney for his wavering views on immigration, mocking the former governor's spotty gun rights record as well as accusations that he's employed illegal immigrants: "Maybe he can get out his small varmint gun and drive those Guatemalans off his yard," McCain said. More recently, an anonymous McCain staffer concluded a dueling series of press releases about the Iraq spending bill by taking a swipe at Democratic candidate Barack Obama's inexperience: "Obama wouldn't know the difference between an RPG and a bong." But McCain told TIME that such combativeness came only as a response to others' attacks and insisted that his campaign does not intend to go on the offensive. "I've had conversations with the people that are close to me," he said. "We're not gonna do that. It's not helpful to me to get my message and my vision out. Now, you can't let an attack go unanswered, but at the same time you don't have to get into some kind of catfight." Asked specifically about his staffer's retort to Obama, he said, "I thought that that was inappropriate and whoever said that should not have said that." He added: "If it happens again, I'll fire the person who said it." When reminded that he laughed at the line when it was read back to him during a conference call with reporters, he said, "I think it was funny, but I still think it was inappropriate." In the interview, McCain also underscored his belief in the "surge" strategy in Iraq. The New York that the White House is considering reducing the troop strength there by at least half as soon as next year, but McCain contended that Bush, in personal conversations, has reiterated his support for a strong presence in the country. "Some people in the State Department and the Pentagon are trying to find the exit sign," said McCain, but "I don't see this President wavering. He may be, but I don't see it. He's committed to seeing this thing through as long as possible."

The group, the "Islamic State of Iraq," said in a video posted on the Internet that it killed the three soldiers after capturing them. The body of one of the American soldiers was found in a canal two weeks ago. The video message said the other two soldiers were killed and buried, but it did not offer proof. The video also showed the military identity cards of the two soldiers. U.S. military spokesman, Brigadier General Kevin Bergner says U.S. and Iraqi forces are continuing to search for the two missing soldiers, despite the release of the video. He says the video does not contain any definitive evidence about their status. Meanwhile, the U.S. military says eight American soldiers were wounded Sunday in an attack involving roadside bombs, small arms fire and mortar rounds at a patrol base southeast of Baghdad. The military also says U.S. and Iraqi troops detained a suspected terrorist and killed another Monday during raids in Baghdad. U.S. military forces say at least 14 American soldiers were killed in Iraq in the first three days of June. In May, 127 U.S. troops were killed, making it the third-deadliest month for U.S. forces since the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Some information for this report was provided by AFP, AP and Reuters.

No one on the ground was hurt when the twin-engine Piper Seneca came to rest atop a garage, said Ian Gregor, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. The plane was approaching Cable Airport about 45 miles east of Los Angeles when it lost power and crashed into three homes. None caught fire. The plane departed from Van Nuys Airport about 50 miles northwest from Upland. "They were on approach when the pilot reported engine problems," Gregor said. Weather didn't appear to be a factor. It was sunny with no clouds or fog. Housing tracts surround the small airport. A plane crashed into a home in nearby Claremont on Dec. 14, 2003, killing the pilot.

The total includes 3,070 million tons of carbon dioxide, 730 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of methane and 260 million carbon dioxide equivalent of nitrous oxide. According to tentative estimates by experts from China, its total GHG emissions in 2004 is about 6,100 carbon dioxide equivalent, of which 5,050 million tons of carbon dioxide, 720 million carbon dioxide equivalent of methane and 330 million carbon dioxide equivalent of nitrous oxide. From 1994 to 2004, the average annual growth rate of GHG emissions is around 4 percent, and the share of carbon dioxide in total GHG emissions increased from 76 percent to 83 percent. China's historical GHG emissions are very low and per capita emission has been below the world average. According to the study carried out by the World Resource Institute (WRI), China's carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion were 79 Mt in 1950, contributing only 1.13 percent of the world total at that time; cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion accounted for only 9.33 percent of the world total during the period of 1959-2002, and the cumulative carbon dioxide emissions per capita are 61.7 tons over the same period, ranking the 92nd in the world. Statistics from the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicate that per capita carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion were 3.65 tons in 2004 in China, equivalent to only 87 percent of the world average and 33 percent of the level in Organization for Economic Co-operation and development (OECD) countries. Along with steady social and economic development, the emission intensity defined as the carbon dioxide emission per unit of GDP declined generally. According to the IEA, China's emission intensity fell to 2.76 kg carbon dioxide per U.S. dollar (constant U.S. dollar) in 2004, as compared to 5.47 kg carbon dioxide per U.S. dollar in 1990, a 49.5 percent decrease. For the same period, emission intensity of the world average dropped only 12.6 percent and of the OECD countries dropped 16.1 percent.

Lewis "Scooter" Libby &laquo; Talking Tough On Iraq In New Hampshire Video Of Missing U.S. Soldiers Released &raquo; Putin's Russia: The Other Frontier appears to be laughing his way to the G-8 summit this week, as U.S. and European leaders scramble to make sense of his newest tough talk on security in the region. Invoking the bad old days of the Cold War, Putin told reporters that Russia would retaliate against a planned U.S. missile defense shield in Poland and the Czech Republic by aiming its own defenses against targets in Europe. "If the U.S. nuclear potential extends across the European territory and threatens Russia, we will be obliged to take countermeasures,'' Putin said, according to a on the Kremlin's Web site (currently available only in Russian). "Of course, we'll have to select new targets in Europe.'' Putin scoffed at Washington's stated rationale for the new defense shield, seconding Iran's and North Korea's claims that they simply aren't capable of lobbing missiles that would reach Europe. "We are being told the anti-missile defense system is targeted against something that does not exist. Doesn't it seem funny to you?" he said. This skirmish is just the latest in a series of rows between Russia and the West over the kind of government Moscow has become since the former KGB man succeeded , the country's first democratically elected, post-communist president, in late 1999. Washington has so far favored a cajoling approach to its one-time enemy -- a nod to Russia's status as a fellow P-5 Security Council member and its substantial influence in parts of the world where the United States has little of its own. But recent visits from Defense Secretary and Secretary of State have had no effect on Russia's opposition to the shield plan. If anything, as Putin's latest remarks indicate, Moscow seems to be digging in its heels even further. This has left Washington and its allies with few options. A NATO spokesman called Putin's remarks "unhelpful and unwelcome" -- two of the West's favorite go-to buzzwords when dealing with powerful and dangerous players, such as Iran and North Korea. European nations that back the shield have expressed alarm at Putin's threat, and France's newly elected president, , said he would have a "frank" one-on-one with Putin during the G-8. Putin may see himself as the defender of a cornered state, fighting off attacks from the United States and others on his human rights record, the ongoing violence in Chechnya, increasingly dangerous conditions for the press and the poisoning death of a Kremlin critic in Britain. Seen in that light, his threat to ratchet up Russia's nuclear weapons arsenal to counter the U.S. shield is likely not an empty one. Sarkozy said he also plans to press Putin on the death of journalist last year -- another sore point of criticism against the Kremlin. British Prime Minister is expected to squeeze Putin on Britain's extradition request for , a suspect in the radiation poisoning of former KGB agent , whose once warm relationship with Putin has soured in recent years, is expected to address Russia's human rights record when they meet on the sidelines of the G-8 meeting. Bush will also try to assuage Putin's concerns about the missile shield when he hosts the Russian leader at Kennebunkport early next month. It's unclear if there's a carrot big enough to persuade Putin to back down on the shield plan, however. He noted in his talk with reporters that the shield would represent the first real American nuclear presence on the European continent -- a fact that is not just unsettling to him And Putin's increasingly isolated posturing may also say something about the people he represents. Violence and corruption are still rampant in Russia, which has had a decade and a half to recover from the fall of communism. In an analysis, the suggests that Russia's paranoia about the West is rooted in the still-unresolved Chechnyan conflict.

(AP) - Republican presidential contenders John McCain and Mitt Romney clashed today over how to solve immigration problems. McCain embraced a bipartisan bill in Congress as a practical solution. Romney dismissed it as unworkable. McCain spoke in politically crucial Florida, with its heavy concentration of Cuban and Haitian immigrants. He argued that while the bill is imperfect, it is an attempt to secure US borders, help the economy and identify those who have entered the nation illegally. The four-term Arizona senator chided rivals who he says are trying to score points on the issue. McCain never mentioned any names but his target was obvious - Romney.

What's your one simple, day-to-day tip to help the planet? Send us your views BEIJING - China promised yesterday to integrate climate change policy into its industrial and energy sectors, but said it would not cave in to international pressure over global warming by sacrificing economic growth. China's first national plan on climate change vows to combat global warming through energy saving, agricultural adaptation, and forest expansion. The plan promises "to integrate climate change policy into other interrelated policies". But the broad blueprint also says developed powers bear the most blame for filling the atmosphere with greenhouse gases. The unveiling of Beijing's climate action plan comes as President Hu Jintao prepares to attend the G8 summit in Germany at which global warming will be major issue. China yesterday welcomed United States President George W. Bush's proposals on global warming as a "positive change", but stressed that any new agreements should not displace the Kyoto Protocol. The Bush plan aims to gather representatives from 15 top polluting nations this year to discuss climate change and come up with long-term goals to combat global warming by the end of 2008. Ma Kai, chief of China's National Development and Reform Commission, which steers climate policy, said any new agreement should complement the United Nations' accord. China, the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after the US, is under international pressure to spell out targets for taming greenhouse gas emissions. The country of 1.3 billion people says it is tackling emissions but ensuring economic growth is its top priority. "The first and overriding priorities of developing countries are sustainable development and poverty eradication," says the plan. Among other steps, the document promises to encourage clean power generation, develop new crop varieties that can withstand long dry spells, and to expand forests that will soak up carbon dioxide. China said it was willing to co-operate with other nations to combat the threat of climate change, but Ma said developed countries had the "unshirkable responsibility" for taking the lead in tacking global warming. "The international community should respect the developing countries' right to develop," Ma said. China estimated its 2004 emissions of greenhouse gases were the equivalent of about 6.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. But Ma said the country's per capita emissions were about one fifth of those of the US. China hopes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through more use of hydropower, wind and biomass energy, boosting nuclear power generation and increasing the efficiency of coal-burning stations.

The group's leader also tells The Associated Press that his organization was not linked to the plot to bomb a fuel pipeline feeding the airport. The plot allegedly involved a U-S citizen, a former Guyanese politician and two men from Trinidad. However, the group's leader declined to say whether he knew any of the suspects. U-S authorities claim the accused plotters tried to secure support from the group, which staged a deadly coup in the Caribbean nation in 1990. Three of the men have been arrested and another is being sought in Trinidad. save this article / add to your favorites list All post and comments are subject to review and filtering by the KXNet.com Webmaster - Any posts containing offensive language, threats, or any other form of abuse will be DELETED In addition, all posts are logged and tracked in our database system including the IP Address and source computer details of the individual who submitted the post.

Probably not, but it might be worth a try if you're running for president at a time when voters think leaders lack integrity. Democrats cast themselves as courageous truth-tellers in their presidential debate Sunday night. Republicans debating Tuesday night might make the same claim. But if recent history is a guide, both fields will be bereft of authentic authenticity. Democratic presidential hopefuls former Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., left, and Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y.appear on stage before the start of the Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., Sunday, June 3, 2007. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) (Charles Krupa - AP) In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article "There is an overarching lack of trust in anybody with power," said Democratic strategist Stephanie Cutter. "It's not just President Bush. It's Congress. It's our CEOs. It's Hollywood. It's Wall Street. There's just an overwhelming lack of trust with authority and the people who have it." Any politician with a pollster knows that the public is particularly jaded toward Washington. From the Vietnam War, Watergate, Iran-contra and President Clinton's impeachment to runaway deficits, soaring health care costs and Hurricane Katrina, people have been fed a steady diet of scandal and misinformation from the federal government. Americans are also better educated and _ thanks to the Internet _ better informed than ever, which helps them spot a phony. They want the real deal. It will be interesting to see what this skeptical electorate thinks of former Sen. John Edwards, a Democrat who has apologized for his 2002 vote to authorize the war in Iraq _ and now wears his mea culpa as a badge of honor. "He was right," Edwards said Sunday night, pointing to of Illinois who opposed the war from the start. "And I was wrong." Edwards is breaking an unwritten rule in Washington to never to acknowledge misjudgment, one that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton treats as gospel. He hopes to make her pay for refusing to apologize for her vote on Iraq. "I think it is important for anybody who seeks to be the next president of the United States, given the dishonesty that we've been faced with over the last several years, to be honest (with) the country," the former North Carolina senator said. Edwards was referring to Bush, whose credibility crumbled in the eyes of most voters after his 2004 re-election. Bush's two biggest problems: The war in Iraq, which began as a fruitless hunt for weapons of mass destruction, and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which exposed a wide gap between administration rhetoric and reality. Earlier this year, just four in 10 Americans consider the president honest and ethical, down from 63 percent in July 2001, according to ABC News/Washington Post polling. In no small measure, Bush has helped usher in the era of authenticity. Wyoming Senator in Serious Condition Bush Discusses Lebanon With Hariri Feds Say La.

Out, is the concept of an impenetrable domed shield for the US. In, is possible limited security against an accidental launch or rogue power such as North Korea. Yet 30 years after "Star Wars" roiled world geopolitics, US missile defense remains a contentious issue, both in Washington and abroad. Support for missile defense in Congress remains mixed. Meanwhile, Russia continues to hammer at Bush administration plans to deploy missile-defense elements in Europe with rhetoric that harks back to US-Soviet cold war days. In an interview released Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that he might respond by re-aiming nuclear weapons at Europe. Military sites on the Continent could be targeted with "ballistic or cruise missiles or maybe a completely new system," said Putin. So far the US has placed 17 long-range interceptor missiles at Fort Greely, Alaska, and Vandenberg Air Force, Calif., according to US Missile Defense Agency officials. This system is still under development, though it was raised to operational status during a recent North Korean missile test. In Europe, plans call for ten interceptors based in Poland, with a radar in the Czech Republic. Overall, the Missile Defense Agency has conducted more than 35 major tests, Air Force Lt. Gen. Henry Obering III, Missile Defense Agency director, told Congress in April. "Overall, since 2001 we have built a record of 26 successful hit-to-kill engagements in 34 attempts," said Gen. Obering. This year the Pentagon is requesting $8.9 billion in missile defense funds, with $7.1 billion of that devoted to developing near-term capabilities, and $1.8 billion earmarked to develop defenses against future threats. Missile defense has enthusiastic boosters on Capitol Hill. Sen. Daniel Inouye (D) of Hawaii, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, said on April 25 that "after nearly 25 years and over $90 billion spent, I believe we can finally say that ... we have turned a corner. The United States has a [missile defense] system in place that could be operational if needed."

Hong Kong remembers Tiananmen International Herald Tribune, Reuters, The Associated Press Published: June 4, 2007 People gathered Monday to commemorate the anniversary of the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing 18 years ago at a candlelight vigil here - the only place in China where such a large public commemoration is traditionally held. The day began quietly in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, where tourists gathered to watch a daily flag-raising ceremony amid tight security. There were no immediate reports of demonstrations on the mainland. Tiananmen Square was full of the usual tour groups, both Chinese and foreign, and locals flying kites, as well as plainclothes security and police vans. At its north end, in front of the giant portrait of Mao Zedong, the police surrounded a woman and rifled through her bag before bundling her off in the back of a van, a sign of the tight rein China keeps on petitioners and protesters. Security forces try to snuff out Tiananmen memorials quickly on the mainland. But Hong Kongers are allowed to mark the anniversary publicly because the former British colony has been promised a wide degree of autonomy since its 1997 handover to China. Today in Asia - Pacific Hong Kong remembers Tiananmen Beijing climate-change strategy has no emission caps Philippine troops defuse bus bomb after U.S. warning Thousands of people usually gather for Hong Kong&#039;s Tiananmen memorial, lighting candles and singing solemn songs in Victoria Park, a spacious venue near the city center. Many residents of the city had supported the Tiananmen protesters, thinking they might help bring political change to China. They were horrified when troops and tanks crushed the demonstration, killing hundreds - maybe thousands. The violence raised fears that the Communist leadership would not honor its promise to allow Hong Kong the civil liberties its people enjoyed under British rule. But 10 years after the handover, Hong Kong still enjoys freedoms that people on the mainland can only dream about. Street protests are common and the press often criticizes the government, though media observers say self-censorship is also frequent. China&#039;s government has called the Tiananmen protest a counterrevolutionary riot and has yet to fully disclose what happened. Human Rights Watch said Beijing&#039;s failure to account for the crackdown has cast a pall on the nation&#039;s campaign to project a new image, even as it prepares to hold the 2008 Olympic Games in 14 months. The New York-based group also said that survivors and victims&#039; families had been subjected to intrusive scrutiny by security officials ahead of the anniversary. "What kind of Olympic host marks the annual anniversary of a brutal massacre by persecuting victims&#039; families and detaining dissidents?" asked Sophie Richardson, the group&#039;s deputy Asia director. "Beijing - and by extension, the 2008 Olympic Games - will remain tarnished by this legacy until the Chinese government provides a complete and truthful account of what happened in June 1989," she said. At least 13 little-known Chinese are still behind bars for their roles in the pro-democracy movement, a human rights group said Monday. "I want to tell those who claim that Tiananmen &#039;belongs to another era&#039; that, behind the high, barbed-wire-ringed walls of the Chinese prisons, Tiananmen prisoners are still suffering and forced to engage in hard labor day and night today," the Chinese Human Rights Defenders said in an e-mailed statement, quoting an unidentified former prisoner of conscience. Few details were known about the 13, beyond their names, the group added. At least three were convicted of "counterrevolutionary sabotage" and one of "counterrevolutionary assault." Seven are serving suspended death sentences and six are imprisoned for life, it said. In Beijing, one victim&#039;s mother, Ding Zilin, was allowed to mourn her son&#039;s death Sunday night in the place where he was shot, the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said. Plainclothes security officers stood by Ding but did not stop her, the center said. Ding, who founded the group Tiananmen Mothers, placed flowers on the spot near the western gate of Tiananmen Square, the Hong Kong broadcaster Commercial Radio reported. The Tiananmen crackdown also shocked Taiwan - a self-ruled, democratic island that Beijing insists should reunited with the mainland. Many Taiwanese cite Tiananmen as a reason to continue resisting China&#039;s calls for unification. Ma Ying-jeou, an opposition presidential candidate in the election next year, issued a statement saying, "The June 4 Tiananmen incident was China&#039;s most drastic suppression of the mainland&#039;s democratic movement." He urged China to push for democratic change. The governing Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan also criticized Beijing. "China has moved backward since the Tiananmen incident," a party spokesman, Lai I-chung, said.

Carla Del Ponte is there to assess the government's co-operation with the tribunal in the Hague, which is key to the prospect of EU membership. Once she reports back, preliminary talks on joining - which stalled last year because of non-cooperation - could resume. One sticking point was overcome last week, when Serb authorities arrested and delivered to the Hague Zdravko Tolimir, who is accused of genocide during the Bosnian war. Tolimir was the right-hand man to the one on the top of the tribunal's wanted list - Ratko Mladic - who is still at large. Observers say it is unlikely the EU will actually sign anything with Serbia until Mladic is before the court.

The Anniston Star » Opinion » Editorials A presidential pledge to keep The 2008 race for president has been placed in a microwave oven set on high. Democratic and Republican hopefuls are already debating on TV. Big-time contributors are being hit up for dollars. Candidates are staking out policy positions. States are jockeying for position to put their presidential primary even earlier in the 2008 calendar. Despite the likelihood that most of the public is not yet tuned in to a general election that is 18 months away, the process has merit. While candidates are making promises here's one for all of them to raise their right hand to: If elected president of the United States, I will not tolerate any member of my administration, including my vice president, disclosing the undercover status of a U.S. spy. According to court filings admitted recently by a federal prosecutor, if George W. Bush had made that pledge he would very likely be under increasing pressure to find a new vice president and a new political guru. Valerie Plame Wilson was a covert CIA officer when her identity was leaked to the media by White House officials in July 2003. In connection to the case I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby has been convicted for obstructing the probe into Wilson's outing, a move seen as revenge against her husband's truth-telling about the Bush administration's prewar fibs on Iraq's threat. Libby, former State Department official Richard Armitage and Bush political strategist Karl Rove were among those involved in the outing of a CIA agent. Libby's trial revealed that Cheney was the person who told Libby of Plame; citing various government sources, the National Journal has reported that it was Cheney who directed Libby to out Wilson in an attempt to discredit her husband. Wilson has testified that when she learned of these leaks, first reported by conservative columnist Robert Novak, she “felt like I had been hit in the gut, it was over in an instant, I immediately thought of my family's safety.” In the process of requesting Libby be sentenced to somewhere between 30 months and 36 months in prison, prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald released the declassified summary of Plame's status. “Ms. Wilson was a covert CIA employee for who the CIA was taking affirmative measures to conceal her intelligence relationship to the United States.” There it is, despite years of denials by Bush administration water-carriers. Valerie Plame Wilson was a covert agent. She kept her connection to the Central Intelligence Agency hidden. In other words, until a revenge-minded White House played politics with the identity of a covert CIA agent in the summer of 2003, Wilson was among that secret army of intelligence agents who work to keep Americans safe. The current crop of presidential candidates who claim to be worthy of the office ought to pledge to turn away from the current White House's horrid example.

Col. Peter Brownback's decision came only minutes into Khadr's arraignment on alleged war crimes and terror-related offences. "The charges are dismissed without prejudice," Brownback said, marking a surprisingly quick end to the proceeding. The reason for the dismissal may have been a technicality - Brownback said that only those classified as "alien unlawful enemy combatants" could be tried under the signed last year by President George W. Bush. The act replaced the previous war-cirmes trial system which was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court. Khadr, 20, had been classified as simply an "enemy combatant." Khadr was accused of throwing a grenade that killed American soldier Sgt. 1st Class Christopher Speer in Afghanistan in 2002. He was 15 at the time. Khadr appeared in court clothed in an olive-green prison uniform and sporting a beard. Even though the charges have been dropped there's no indication the Canadian man will be freed from the military base anytime soon. He's one of roughly 380 men being held at the camp suspected of having links to terror groups like the Taliban and al-Qaida. Khadr, whose father Ahmen Said Khadr was apparently close to al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden before he was killed by Pakistani troops in 2003, was about to go to trial at the beginning of last year before the Supreme Court put an end to the tribunals.

Four decades after an underdog Israeli military campaign that captured the world's imagination, the people of Israel, the Middle East and the world are are still struggling to come to terms with it. The war tripled Israel's size and probably prevented its annihilation. But with victory came burdens, hatreds and many, many deaths for Israelis and the Palestinians in their newly-expanded territory.(AP Photo/Oded Balilty) JERUSALEM - A grudging handshake on the White House lawn promised two peoples what they so desperately craved: for the Palestinians, a state of their own, for the Israelis, peace and quiet. Soon after, the two sides returned to violence. That squandered moment of hope in 1993 has been the trend for 40 years since Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the Six Day War. As Palestinians and Israelis mark the anniversary Tuesday of the start of that war, a majority of both now favor two states side by side , a goal that remains frustratingly out of reach. On Sept. 13, 1993, then-President Clinton nudged Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the direction of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin after the two signed the first-ever agreement between their two peoples , a framework for peace. Rabin needed a push from his foreign minister to extend his hand to Arafat. The reluctant handshake now seems like an omen that things would not go so smoothly. After five years of largely fruitless negotiations, the peace process gave way to violence. It has been the pattern since 1967: brief high points overwhelmed in a sea of bloody Palestinian attacks and Israeli military operations and restrictions. After Israel routed Egypt and Syria and pushed the Jordanian military out of east Jerusalem and the West Bank, Israelis and Palestinians were in contrasting states of shock. Israelis by the tens of thousands streamed to Jerusalem to see and touch the holiest site in Judaism, the Western Wall, off limits to them and under Jordanian control since 1949. Others traveled to biblical sites in the West Bank. The ecstasy was so great that many talked of the coming of the Messiah. At the same time, terrified Palestinians cowered in their houses, many expecting pain and death at the hands of the Israeli military, which had just vanquished the best of the Arab war machine in less than a week. At first, Israelis did not accept that there was such a thing as a Palestinian people. Then they believed that if they treated the Palestinians well enough, they would drop the political ambitions of exiled leaders like Arafat. In June 1987, the Israeli Civil Administration, an arm of the military, put out a full-color booklet trumpeting Israel's accomplishments during its two decades in control of the West Bank and Gaza, giving the Palestinian people roads, schools, hospitals and prosperity. But Palestinians chafed under the occupation, and just five months later the situation blew up. Gaza, then the West Bank, erupted in riots. Israeli forces tried to put them down, killing demonstrators throwing rocks and firebombs. At the center of the uprising were young Palestinians who grew up under Israeli occupation and demanded its end. The violence forced Israel into negotiations with Arafat's PLO, in secret at first and then publicly, leading to that handshake on the White House lawn. Arafat made a triumphant return to Gaza in 1994, and both sides felt peace was on the way. They were wrong. Agreements were negotiated but not fully implemented. Israel pulled out of West Bank cities and refugee camps, but kept a tight hold on Palestinian life. Palestinians smuggled large quantities of weapons into their areas, preparing for more clashes. When violence erupted again in September 2000, it seemed inevitable. The last seven years have seen more than 100 Palestinian suicide bombing attacks against Israelis and intense Israeli military incursions in the West Bank and Gaza. Even Israel's unilateral pullout from Gaza in 2005 didn't stem the chaos, with the impoverished coastal strip deteriorating into anarchic world of gang wars and attacks on Israel that invite retaliation. On Sunday, Israeli tanks and infantry pushed a short distance into Gaza, detaining several Palestinians in their fight against gunmen. Years of polls show both sides want a state living in peace next to the other state, but their leaders have proved unable to overcome the historic stumbling blocks, especially control over Jerusalem and a solution for Palestinian refugees from the 1948-49 war that followed Israel's creation. Israel's grim reality is typified by extreme security , guards checking bags for bombs at the entrances to buildings, ex-generals routinely elected to positions of leadership, the military maintaining a strong influence in the country. Palestinians suffer daily. Hundreds of Israeli roadblocks stop them from moving freely in the West Bank, Gaza is often cut off from the world, their economy is stifled and their lives are dominated by the ever-present Israeli soldier, bureaucrat or roadblock. Now Israel is building a barrier along the West Bank, jutting into the territory in several places, ostensibly to stop suicide bombers from entering Israel. It's a wall that marks a border in time , hopes of peaceful coexistence in the past, a reality of violence and hatred in the present.

While choosing a winner is a matter of spin and opinion, it's clear the candidates engaged in a more energetic, contested and conversational forum than their earlier debate in South Carolina. There were more distinctions drawn and more specifics given on issues by the candidates such as Iraq, raising taxes for health care and priorities on terrorism. It was also a contrast in styles. While Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York, the front-runner in early primary polling, talked about the common themes between the candidates and assailed the Bush administration, former Sen. John Edwards chose a different track by aggressively targeting Clinton &#8212; and to a lesser extent, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois &#8212; for her Iraq war authorization vote in 2002 and for not showing sufficient leadership in ending the war. "I was wrong. I should have never voted for the war," Edwards said early in the debate about his vote in 2002. But he was countered by Clinton, who said "this is George Bush's war" and "we are trying to end the war." Obama sharply noted that Edwards was more than four years late on leadership on Iraq. The so-called lower-tier candidates, who were called on less by moderator Wolf Blitzer of CNN, had their moments. Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware seized his moments by speaking passionately about taking action on Iraq, Darfur, Iran and campaign finance reform. Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut explained his energy and global warming proposals and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson touted his experience as a chief executive and former United Nations ambassador. Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel were the most outspoken and more willing to blame their fellow Democrats for funding the Iraq war and health care reform. One of the questions had a distinctive New Hampshire flavor. A few days after Gov. John Lynch signed civil union legislation into law, a question about support for gay marriage was sidestepped by the candidates. With the debate signaling the beginning of a potentially less intense phase of summer campaigning, CNN analyst James Carville said the debate could have a larger impact on the politically active New Hampshire populace than the rest of the nation.

Jefferson Indicted on 16 Counts From Congressional Quarterly | Go to Sign up for daily headlines via e-mail Lewis Retirement Report Off Base, Say Aides to Top House GOP Appropriator His Cancer Unresponsive, Sen. Thomas Listed in Serious Condition Rep. Jefferson Indicted on 16 Counts &#160; | &#160; 3:45 PM; Jun. 04, 2007 | &#160; A federal grand jury on Monday handed up an indictment accusing Rep. William J. Jefferson of accepting bribes in exchange for helping put together telecommunications deals in Africa. The grand jury in Alexandria, Va., declared that there are grounds to try the Louisiana Democrat on 16 charges, including soliciting bribes, racketeering, money laundering, obstruction of justice, wire fraud, conspiracy and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Jefferson has been under investigation for years, and won re-election in 2006 despite reports that FBI agents had found $90,000 in marked bills in the freezer of his home during a 2005 raid. In September 2006, Vernon Jackson, former head of the telecom firm iGate, was sentenced to 87 months in prison for trying to bribe Jefferson with more than $400,000 in hopes of landing contracts from the Army and a number of African nations. As part of the probe, investigators allege that on July 30, 2005, they videotaped Jefferson receiving a briefcase containing $100,000 from an FBI informant. A few days later, the FBI executed search warrants to examine Jeffersonâ€™s homes and car, seizing a number of items, including $90,000 in marked bills from a freezer in his Washington home. Jefferson, who maintains his innocence, was re-elected in November. He is fighting in court to retrieve documents seized by the FBI during a raid on his congressional office last year. As the indictments were being announced, House Minority Leader John A. Boehner issued a statement warning that he intended to bring up a privileged resolution demanding that the ethics committee investigate whether Jefferson should be expelled.

The suicide bomber struck outside Gedi&#x2019;s house in the capital, Mogadishu, yesterday , injuring several people, witnesses said. Gedi was not hurt. Gedi&#x2019;s interim administration is struggling to impose its authority on the anarchic state. In Bossasso, Mohamed Ali Yusuf, finance minister in the semi-autonomous Puntland administration, alleged that among the Islamists killed in weekend air strikes were fighters from the UK, Sweden, Morocco, Pakistan and Yemen. Yusuf said five Puntland troops were wounded. The US and Puntland forces launched a combined attack on the northern region on Friday. CNN said the attacks were aimed at an al-Qaeda suspect. A Somali jihadist group calling itself the Young Mujahideen Movement earlier said it suffered no casualties in what it called &#x201C;random&#x201D; US air strikes. The movement claimed to have killed 11 soldiers. Speaking in Singapore, US Defence Secretary Robert Gates declined to comment on the strikes, saying it was possibly an operation still in progress. CNN quoted unnamed sources as saying the attacks were the second in six months aimed at a suspect in the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 240 people. Puntland residents said violence broke out after a group of Islamists, including foreign fighters, landed by boat in the area last Wednesday before exchanging fire with local police. The US also launched air strikes in southern Somalia in January aimed at three top al-Qaeda suspects but killed their allies instead. The three suspects were believed to be in a group of Islamists who fled the capital, Mogadishu, in January after being routed by the Somali interim government and its Ethiopian military allies. Washington says six al-Qaeda operatives or associates are in Somalia, including alleged embassy bomber Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, and Abu Talha al-Sudani, accused of orchestrating the 2002 bombing of an Israeli-owned hotel in Kenya that killed 15. Others include Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, hardline leader of the ousted Somali Islamic Courts Council (SICC).

The 62-page report said China is taking steps toward improving energy efficiency over 2005 levels by as much as 20 per cent by the year 2010.Â It said a top priority was to tackleÂ China's own environmental problems. China's top economic planner said the country will not submit to any outside targets and won't let its industrial development be hampered by any fight in the West against global warming. "The consequences of restricting the development of developing nations will be much more serious than the consequences of global warming," said Ma Kai, the minister heading the National Development and Reform Commission. Ma stressed that the bulk of responsibility for battling climate change still lies with industrialized countries, which "are in a better position to cap emissions." Developing nationsÂ like ChinaÂ remainÂ focused onÂ eradicatingÂ poverty, he said. China signed on to Kyoto because it's a developing country it's not bound by the accord's gas emissions targets, the report said. "Although we are not committed to quantified emissions reduction, it does not mean we do not want to shoulder our share of responsibilities," the minister said. "We must reconcile the need for development with the need for environmental protection," he told reporters. "In its course of modernization, China will not tread the traditional path of industrialization, featuring high consumption and high emissions. "In fact, we want to blaze a new path to industrialization." The report said China would put more emphasis on measures to save energy and cut the discharge ofÂ pollutants by gradually reforming the pricing system of fuels, such as oil and coal,Â to reflect their true scarcity and impact on the environment. China relies on coal to meet two-thirds of its energy needs and is projected to surpass the United States as the world's number one producer of greenhouse gases sometime within the next two years. Implementation will 'cost a fortune' The Chinese plan also calls forÂ expanded research intoÂ andÂ use of new energy-saving technologies, improvement of agriculture infrastructure, increased tree planting and water resource management, and greater public awareness of the issue. Ma said implementation will "cost a fortune," but did not elaborate, stressing that it would be an investment in prevention. China'sÂ economy has been growing at better thanÂ nine per cent annually over the past 25 years, and if that continues, the plan's overall effect, if implemented, would be to slow the increase in greenhouse gases, not reduce their absolute amount. Monday's release of the report seemed in part an attempt to pre-empt criticism of China's environmental policies. China has fallen under increasing pressure internationally to take more forceful measures to curb releases of greenhouse gases.

Market Sensitive Global News Philippines Troops Defuse Bus Bomb After Alert [] 6/4/2007 7:34:17 AM Monday, Philippine troops defused a powerful bomb found in a packed bus in southern Maguindanao's Talitay town on Monday, following an alert from the US Embassy that terrorists might carry out attacks in bus terminals. Police and army experts defused the bomb - black powder stuffed in a pitcher with steel fragments for deadlier effect - which was attached to a timer and batteries but was not yet set to explode after panicky passengers grabbed the bag and hurled it outside the bus, regional army spokesman Lt. Col. Julieto Ando said. The bomb was hidden in a backpack on a bus where it was hastily abandoned by two men late Sunday, Ando said. A police investigation was under way to nab the culprits. Liberia's Charles Taylor Goes On Trial [] 6/4/2007 7:17:07 AM The war crimes trial of the former Liberian President Charles Taylor, accused of brutal atrocities during neighboring Sierra Leone's bloody civil war, has opened in The Hague, Netherlands on Monday with the accused refusing to attend proceedings. Taylor, who has been shifted to The Hague a year ago amid fears his trial in Sierra Leone could trigger fresh violence in the capital, Freetown, is the first African leader to face justice at an international tribunal. Taylor, a former warlord who was elected Liberia's president in 1997, was indicted in 2003, accused of sponsoring Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone in an 11-year campaign that killed thousand of civilians in return for diamonds illegally mined in Sierra Leone. Taylor agreed to give up power and go into exile, but was taken into custody in March 2006 as he tried to cross the border from Nigeria to Cameroon. Taylor, who has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted. His trial is expected to last 18 months. Judge Julia Sebutinde ordered the trial to continue without Taylor, amid vociferous protests from his lawyer, Karim Khan. Khan then left the court, saying he was not in a position to represent his client without further instruction from him.

From Beirut, VOA's Margaret Besheer has this report on the militant group at the center of the crisis. The first time many Lebanese learned of the existence of Fatah al-Islam was in February, when a twin bus bombing outside Beirut killed three people and injured 20 others. The group was linked to the attack. Then last month, they surfaced again when some of their members were charged with a dramatic bank robbery in the northern port city of Tripoli. Shell explodes on a building being used by militants in the besieged Nahr el-Bared refugee camp near the city of Tripoli An ambush of Lebanese army positions in Tripoli on May 20 killed more than 30 soldiers and triggered the current fighting. The army has launched a military campaign to force militants holed up inside the Nahr el-Bared Palestinian refugee camp to surrender. But Fatah al-Islam says it will fight to the death. Paul Salem, Director of the Carnegie Endowment's Middle East Center in Beirut says the group's several hundred fighters came to the Nahr El-Bared camp, near the northern city of Tripoli, over the past year. "It is not clear who exactly is behind them, and I think that is part of the point," Salem said. "Some of these groups are being set up precisely to do those things without them being traceable to someone." But American University of Beirut political science professor Ahmad Moussalli says they are al-Qaida linked. "I think definitely. Some of them were trained in Afghanistan with al-Qaida, some of them fought in Iraq," he said. "Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the famous - or infamous - leader of al-Qaida of Iraq, was affiliated with this group, and he in fact pushed this group to organize itself in Lebanon." Many theories exist in Lebanon about who is behind Fatah al-Islam. One is that the Future Movement of Saad Hariri, a pro-Western Sunni leader, wanted a Sunni militia to defend against the growing influence of the Shiite Hezbollah movement following last summer's war between Hezbollah and Israel. Professor Moussalli agrees with this theory. "Because of last year's war they [Fatah] were encouraged to create a militia," he said. "They were given arms, support, finance and so forth. So they turned from 19 to 20 people to about 1,000 people in about six months. The government wants to try to distance itself from this phenomenon." But the Carnegie Endowment's Paul Salem strongly disagrees. "I think that is way off. I don't think that is the case, particularly in Lebanon. In Lebanon the Hariri government is supporting, and has been in a very strong way, the Sunni mainstream, and has moderated the Sunni community tremendously," he said. Professor Moussalli believes the group is well-financed with money coming from several sources. "Partly from al-Qaida; partly from Lebanese; partly from Gulf states; partly from religious individuals. I don't think they have trouble getting money, obviously," he said. So what is Fatah al-Islam trying to accomplish? The experts say chaos and civil war. Carnegie's Paul Salem: "I think their goal is to hamstring the Lebanese Army, to destabilize the country and to put pressure on the country and through the country the international community," Salem said. American University of Beirut political science professor Ahmad Moussalli agrees. "They are working to create confusion, to create problems, to open up venues for civil war in Lebanon," he said. Meanwhile, as the standoff with Fatah al-Islam drags into a third week, a second group, Jund al-Sham, have clashed with the Lebanese Army outside the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon. The clashes at the southern Ein el-Hilweh camp have sparked fears that fighting could spread to some or all of Lebanon's 12 Palestinian refugee camps. Professor Moussalli says he is not surprised that the violence has spread. "This was expected. Because Fatah al-Islam is a splinter group that started with Jund al-Sham," he said. "So they are not removed or far away from them ideologically; organizationally. Some of the Fatah al-Islam leadership came from Jund al-Sham in Ein al-Hilweh camp." Professor Moussalli says regional problems - such as the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Iraq war - in addition to internal Lebanese troubles, have allowed such militant groups to take root and flourish in Lebanon.

Sabean, and it's time to go Better times bring worse traffic Group denies link to NYC terror plot By TONY FRASER Associated Press Writer Article Launched: 06/04/2007 09:53:47 AM PDT Click photo to enlarge Trinidadian Kareem Ibrahim, 56, arrives to the Magistrate Court for an extradition hearing in downtown Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, Monday, June 4, 2007. Ibrahim and Guyanan Abdul Kadir, who are in custody of the Trinidad's authorities, are suspects in a plot to blow up a fuel line that feeds New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad- The leader of a radical Trinidadian Muslim group denied Monday that his organization had any connection to four men accused of planning to attack New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Yasin Abu Bakr, the leader of Jamaat al Muslimeen, told The Associated Press he knew "nothing" about the alleged plan to bomb a fuel pipeline feeding the airport, a plot authorities say was hatched by a group that included a former Guyanese politician. U.S. authorities claim the alleged plotters sought support in Trinidad from Jamaat al Muslimeen, which staged a deadly coup attempt in the Caribbean nation in 1990. The men did not receive such support, according to court documents. But the documents also say that Abdel Nur, a Guyanese suspect thought to be still at large in Trinidad, said he met in May with Abu Bakr at his compound in Trinidad and the Islamic leader suggested that he return later with others involved "to discuss the plan in detail." Nur allegedly said the Jamaat al Muslimeen leader also wanted to do further checks on Russell Defreitas, the 63-year-old accused mastermind of the plot, and an unidentified confidential informant who had infiltrated the group, the documents said. Abu Bakr declined to say if he knew the men, but also denied any involvement. "I know nothing about these men, and I have nothing to do with whatever they are being charged for," he said in his first public comments since U.S. authorities disclosed the plot on Saturday. Two of the suspects&mdash;Abdul Kadir, a former member of Guyana's parliament, and Kareem Ibrahim of Trinidad&mdash;are in custody in Trinidad. Nur was being sought by Trinidadian authorities. Defreitas, a U.S. citizen native to Guyana and former JFK air cargo employee, was jailed in the United States. Abu Bakr's group, often accused of aiming to create an Islamic state in Trinidad, describes itself simply as a religious organization. The group stormed Parliament and took the prime minister and his Cabinet hostage in a 1990 rebellion that left 24 dead&mdash;the only Islamic revolt in the Western Hemisphere. The rebels eventually surrendered and were later pardoned. It is not known to have international reach, although a member was convicted of trying to smuggle 70 assault rifles to Trinidad from Florida in 2005. Abu Bakr faces charges stemming from a 2005 sermon in which he called for war against rich Muslims who refuse to pay zakaat, an Islamic tithe used to alleviate poverty. The following week, he was arrested by police who razed the group's compound and charged him with sedition and incitement to violence. "You know why they are linking me with this so-called plot is to bias the minds of jurors who will be sitting in my case," he said. Separately, a lawyer for the two men held in Trinidad said they would fight extradition to the United States. Ibrahim and Kadir made their initial court appearance Monday for extradition on one count each of conspiracy to commit a terrorist act against the U.S. government. "We will be opposing extradition," said Rajid Persad, a lawyer who represents both men. The judge set another hearing for June 11 to consider bail and scheduled an extradition hearing for Aug. 2. Farid Scoon, another lawyer for the men, said they intend to seek bail. The extradition fight could be a drawn-out affair. Ibrahim and Kadir could appeal all the way to the Privy Council in Britain, the highest court of appeal for the former British territory.

With the India-Brazil joint commission's meeting in April setting out an ambitious agenda for the bilateral relationship &#151; including the endeavour to boost two-way trade from the current annual level of $2.6 billion to more than $10 billion by 2010 &#151; the two countries signed a number of agreements on Monday aimed at implementing that roadmap. President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, stood next to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at Hyderabad House on Monday as officials signed agreements for cooperation in the oil sector, film and audiovisual co-production, space, customs matters, academic exchanges and economic research. These agreements build on earlier agreements dealing with bio-fuel and pharmaceuticals cooperation in other sectors. In the oil sector, ONGC Videsh Ltd. and Petrobras, Brazil's national oil company, agreed to swap stakes in three off-shore exploration blocks. The two leaders also held talks on a wide range of international issues, including United Nations reform, world trade negotiations, energy security and climate change. The presence in Mr. Lula's delegation of more than 100 business executives underscored the new economic content that both countries are seeking to give to the old vector of South-South cooperation. In his address to a gathering of Indian and Brazilian CEOs, the Brazilian President exhorted them to push bilateral trade beyond the target of $10 billion. "Don't give me excuses. India and Brazil can do more than $10 billion bilateral trade by 2010... No distance can diminish the appetite of a bold entrepreneur for trade. India today is a land of opportunity. So is Brazil," he said. Mr. Lula said the time had come for India and Brazil to consolidate their strategic partnership. "The 21st century will be the century of opportunity for India and Brazil," he declared, adding, "India and Brazil are being recognised as key players in the international scene. Our interests converge in multilateral forums". On Monday, the Brazilian President was also awarded the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding 2006 by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for his contribution to "strengthening relations" among developing nations. Accepting the award, Mr. Lula dedicated it to "all who want a peaceful world" and described Nehru as a source of inspiration for people who were "struggling for independence and laid the groundwork for an egalitarian nation." In his speech at the banquet in honour of Mr. Lula, Mr. Kalam said India and Brazil could cooperate in a number of fields, including the development of a 100-seater passenger jet "using the core competencies of both our countries in the field of aerospace." Such a jointly developed passenger jet could then be marketed worldwide. The jatropha plant &#151; on which India's nascent bio-fuels programme will rely &#151; came to India from Brazil via the Portuguese, he noted.

The body of one soldier, Pfc. Joseph Anzack Jr, was later found inIraq's Euphrates River, but the other two soldiers have not been found. The Washington-based SITE Institute said it had obtained the 10-minute, 41-second video that shows the planning stages, kidnapping operation, as well as footage from after the attack. The institute, which monitors militant Web sites, said the video also shows the identification cards of two of the two missing soldiers. A prominent Islamic Web site, which often posts videos from militant groups, said it would show the video within hours. The three US soldiers were captured south of Baghdad on May 12 in an ambush later claimed by an insurgent umbrella group, the Islamic State of Iraq, that includes al-Qaeda in Iraq.

Key findings left out Earth nearing &#39;tipping points&#39; High acidity endangers ocean reefs Too late for polar areas? Ice key to life on Earth It happens like a boat tipping Use of fossil fuels blamed China's first energy plan lacks specific cuts By Calum MacLeod, USA TODAY BEIJING &#151; China, the world's second-largest producer of greenhouse gases, unveiled its first national climate change program Monday, but a government official said other industrialized nations also bore the responsibility to combat global warming. "At some point in time China will overtake the USA as the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases," said Ma Kai, China's top economic planning official, as he introduced the new program Monday in Beijing. The International Energy Agency warns China may overtake the United States within two years. But Ma said China's right to modernize and industrialize outweighed international pressure to set caps on emissions that could hurt the country's economic development. The program announced Monday stresses improved energy efficiency to help China slow greenhouse gas emissions, which scientists say trap heat in the atmosphere, but the plan does not commit to any cut in total output. "We will not tread the traditional path to industrialization through high consumption and high emissions," promised Ma, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, which directs China's climate policy. "We want to deliver economic development and protect the environment," he said. The challenge of achieving that balance will be high on the agenda this week in Germany, when China's President Hu Jintao joins President Bush at a Group of Eight leaders meeting. Ma Kai welcomed Bush's proposals on global warming, announced Thursday, as a "positive shift in attitude," but insisted the new U.S. initiative should be "a useful complement to the U.N. Framework Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, and not a substitute for the two international documents." The breakneck growth of the Chinese economy, mainly fired by electricity from coal-burning, heavily-polluting power stations, has prompted international calls for China to set emissions caps. Beijing continues to reject such pressure as unfair interference from developed nations who have caused most greenhouse gases to date. "To ask developing countries to lower emissions too early, too abruptly and too bluntly will hinder their development and hamper efforts to achieve industrialization and modernization," said Ma. To respond to climate change, the plan stresses measures such as energy conservation, better technology in farming and forestry expansion. Beijing hopes the new measures will boost energy efficiency by 20% by 2010, and increase the percentage of renewable energy to 10% from the current 7% in 2010. While Ma did not disclose the cost of China's program, he said "whatever the cost is, it is worth it. Early action will cost less than late action." Citing historical data to show developed countries produced 77% of global CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels from 1950 to 2002, Ma said developed nations have an "unshirkable responsibility" for climate change. Even when China overtakes the USA as the leading producer of greenhouse gases, "China's per capita output will only be one fifth of the USA's," Ma said. Referring to Bush's proposals on global warming, Ma welcomed the new initiative's link "between climate change on the one hand and economic development and energy security on the other." The "common ground" between Washington and Beijing is expanding, Ma said. However, developed nations are still not living up to their promises to supply the developing world with financial and technical aid to tackle climate change, he added. "We have heard a lot of thunder, but have not seen much rain," Ma said, reminding developed nations of their "obligations under international conventions to provide technical and financial support to developing nations." On Sunday, China's government released a work plan for energy conservation, whose targets it missed last year, and promised to reduce major pollutant discharges by 10%. In contrast to the past, when economic growth was the only criteria for promotion, local government leaders and company heads were put on notice that their records on energy efficiency and pollutant reduction will be key to future performance assessments. One concrete measure announced Sunday calls for a minimum temperature of 26 degrees Celsius (78.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in all China's air-conditioned public rooms. The move aims to save China's limited energy resources when electricity demand peaks in the country's hot summer months.

The future of music global community of music makers discover new music Jun. 4, 2007 7:17 | Updated Jun. 4, 2007 23:22 Justice Ministry slams Amnesty report Talkbacks for this article: The Justice Ministry charged on Monday that Amnesty International's report on Israel's treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank was "immoral" and "inaccurate." In its 44-page report, "Enduring Occupation, Palestinians Under Siege in the West Bank," released earlier in the day, Amnesty in turn called Israeli restriction of Palestinian movement in the West Bank "unlawful," "disproportionate" and "discriminatory." The report was released on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the Six Day War. But it focused on the last seven years of violence, in which 4,000 Palestinians and 1,100 Israelis have been killed. It opened with the story of Palestinian baby Khaled Daud Faqih, which Amnesty alleged, died because his parents were delayed at a checkpoint and could not get him to a hospital fast enough. It moved quickly from there to the security fence, which it said was illegal under international law. It further alleged that the military's destruction of private Palestinian property during the building of the fence was a "war crime." In this latest report, Amnesty called on Israel to "end the land-grabbing, blockades and other violations of international law" in the West Bank. In a statement that accompanied the report, Amnesty's director of the Middle East and North Africa program, Malcolm Smart, wrote, "For 40 years, the international community has failed adequately to address the Israeli-Palestinian problem; it cannot, must not, wait another 40 years to do so." To help remedy the situation, Amnesty called for the "urgent deployment of an effective international human rights mechanism to monitor compliance." Those who violate international law should be prosecuted, it said. The Foreign Ministry told that it rejected the idea of international monitoring body. The Justice Ministry, along with the Foreign Ministry, condemned the report as biased. "Israel views with the utmost importance the safeguarding of human rights and invests abundant resources in doing so," the Justice Ministry said. It charged that Amnesty's report was "riddled with mistakes and numerous factual and legal inaccuracies, including scant mention of Palestinian terrorism." In particular, the ministry took the report to task for not emphasizing the centrality of Palestinian terror. "The report does not contain even a vaguely factual presentation of the initiatives taken by Israeli law-enforcement authorities... to safeguard human rights," the Justice Ministry said. But Amnesty in turn refuted Israel's claim that it was concerned with the rights of Palestinians. To support its point, it provided statistics, photographs and personal stories about Palestinians who have been killed or suffered at the hands of Israelis. None of the same photographic or personal material was included with respect to the Israelis killed by Palestinian terrorists. Still, in a nod to Israel, the report does note that Israel believed the security fence as well as the 500 roadblocks and checkpoints are necessary to prevent suicide bombings. Vice Premier Shimon Peres, in an interview with Israel Radio on Monday, faulted the report for failing to make the link between the drop in suicide bombings in the last few years and the erection of the security fence, which is still being worked on. The researcher who wrote the Amnesty report, Donatella Rovera, said her organization's issue was not with the fence, but with the placement of 80 percent of it within the West Bank rather then along the pre-1967 borders.

Earthquakes rattle NH Seacoast New Hampshire's Emergency Management Agency says mild earthquakes shook the state's Seacoast area Saturday and Sunday, rattling a lot of wall photos and cupboard items, but not causing injuries or property damage. Many residents called police to report hearing explosions and authorities were trying to figure out just what happened. They initially said the blasts might have been underground methane explosions. The U.S. Geological Web Site reported a 1.9 magnitude earthquake 7 miles southwest of Portsmouth on Saturday at 7:56 p.m. By 10:30 p.m., Emergency Management reported a 1.4 magnitude earthquake, centered about a mile and a half north of Exeter. On Sunday at 2:35 p.m., Portsmouth Emergency Dispatch again received numerous 911 calls from the same area, reporting a loud bang followed by the earth shaking briefly. Authorities treated this as an earthquake, too. &copy; Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, on a visit to New Delhi, told business leaders that both countries could not only achieve the 'target we have set, we could go beyond that.' 'We have decided to increase our trade from the present 2.4 bln usd to 10 bln by 2010,' Lula said here on his second visit to India since 2003. 'We have not even discovered 10 pct of our trade potential.' During a visit by Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh to Brazil in September, Lula's administration promised to help New Delhi produce ethanol and cut its dependence on oil. Brazil is the largest producer and exporter of ethanol, which may be used by 80 pct of new cars sold in the country. Ethanol meets 17 pct of Brazil's fuel needs. Brazil produces 16 bln liters annually, of which 3 bln liters re exported, according to official statistics. Lula also held talks with Singh, with both sides signing seven agreements to cement their strategic partnership, an Indian official said.

So now they try to shoot in mortars and rockets. I think it is working wonderfully. Isreal pulls out of Gaza as a unilateral peace offering and it is tought to be weakness, instilling further attemps by the PLO to fight. Unfortunitly you NEVER hear any talk of PEACE from the muslim.

The Wall Is Illegal as is Israel's Occupation Jun 4th, 2007 - 11:20:04 let's stick to the article: The wall is illegal since it is built not on Israeli land, but Palestinian land. If you want protection from your neighbor, you don't go over to his back yard and build your fence. You build it on the property line. With half of the Palestinian government in Israeli jails, west bank families living on a bottle of water per person per day, embargo on all funds to Palestine, it looks like Israel is repeating the English tactics practiced in Ireland 150 years ago: starve them, beat them and ship them out. And the Irish did exactly what the Palestinians are doing today: leave for other countries, deteriorate into civil war, and terrorize their enemy. Can you blame them? They are fighting for their lives. Israel never gave back the Gaza: they still control all the borders and constantly send in missles to target 'militants' (oh, if an occassional child gets blasted to bits, that's just collateral damage). And the West Bank was never released from the strangle hold of the military. Israel doesn't want peace. It just wants Ersatz Israel and the USA is right behind this land grab.

Some probably failed ingloriously, and most of those that succeeded at first were later crushed under the rubble of the Berlin Wall, but a few survived the Soviet debacle and went on to prosper in its aftermath, and of these, Amnesty International must be counted among those that most convincingly went on to flourish after managing the difficult transition with suitable adroitness. Only three years have passed since 2004 when the fiftieth birthday of its governing idea should have been celebrated and it is meet and just, albeit belatedly, to throw light on its true origins and rescue from obscurity the name of its real begetter.

About 28,000 people overflowed six soccer pitches in Causeway Bay&#39;s Victoria Park, where the vigil has been held since 1990, according to an estimate by Hong Kong police. Event organizers said 55,000 people attended. ``I have to tell my child what really happened 18 years ago,&#39;&#39; said Ray Fok 39, who went to the rally with his wife and their 7-year-old son. ``What Ma Lik said was a total denial of what happened. China owes the victims an explanation.&#39;&#39; The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, which organized the candlelight vigil, took out advertisements in four local newspapers condemning the May 15 comments of Ma Lik that there was no ``massacre.&#39;&#39; Ma, head of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, later apologized for ``rash and frivolous&#39;&#39; remarks. Hong Kong, with its separate legal system, is the only place in China that marks the June 4 crackdown, which occurred eight years before the former British colony returned to Chinese rule. More than 40,000 attended the vigil last year and in 2005, according to organizers, down from more than 80,000 in 2004, the year China ruled out full democracy in the city. Peter Wong, a Hong Kong-based delegate of the National People&#39;s Congress in Beijing, today joined Ma by saying ``using the term of massacre is wrong&#39;&#39; because it should be applied to incidents such as the ethnic cleansing of the Balkans wars and religious conflicts. ``We all saw what happened in Tiananmen Square,&#39;&#39; Wong said in comments broadcast during a program on Radio Television Hong Kong. ``People (soldiers) didn&#39;t go there deliberately to kill people. The intention of the government was to maintain the order of the city and the country.&#39;&#39; About a million people -- out of a population that was then 5.7 million -- turned out in 1989, just hours after the killings. Jimmy Lai, chairman of Next Media Ltd, said he attended the vigil ``because that&#39;s what a Hong Kong citizen should do.&#39;&#39; Lai said he&#39;s missed only one rally since they began, because he was overseas at the time. Most of Next Media&#39;s publications such as Apple Daily and Next Magazine are banned in mainland China because of their anti- Beijing political stance. Apple Daily published a full-page banner urging the resignation of Hong Kong&#39;s Beijing-backed former Chief Executive Tung Chee-Hwa, which demonstrators brought to a July 2003 rally. Szeto Wah, chairman of the vigil&#39;s organizer, called for the Chinese government to ``release democracy protesters, tell the truth about June 4, end one-party dictatorship and develop democracy in China.&#39;&#39; Wang Dan, a Chinese democracy activist living in exile in the U.S., in a pre-recorded video message called for people to continue to fight for justice in China. This year&#39;s commemoration came less than a month before the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong&#39;s return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997. Fok said economic improvements in China over the last several years didn&#39;t justify oppression. ``Human rights and economic benefits in China are two different things,&#39;&#39; he said. ``We can&#39;t deny the truth and sacrifice human rights just because we can make a lot of money.&#39;&#39; To contact the reporter on this story: Theresa Tang in Hong Kong at Last Updated: June 4, 2007 10:47 EDT Japan&#39;s Companies Invest More Than Expected, Signaling Export Confidence China&#39;s CSI 300 Plunges 7.7 Percent, Extending Stocks Rout to $350 Billion China Mobile to Seek Bids for as Much as $784 Million in High-Speed Phones

Larijani says Tehran's current missile arsenal cannot reach Europe and adds that it would be illogical for Tehran to attack Europe, which is Iran's most important commercial partner. But Doug Richardson, the editor of the London-based defense journal "Jane's Missiles and Rockets," tells RFE/RL correspondent Ron Synovitz that Iranian missiles probably can already reach parts of Europe. He adds that Iran appears to be developing long-range missiles that could reach Italy, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. Iranian National Security Council Secretary Larijani reportedly has described the U.S. missile-defense shield for Europe as "the joke of the year," saying Iranian missiles do not have the range to reach Europe. Do Iranian missiles now have the capability to reach European targets from Iranian territory? They do have a capability to hit some of Eastern Europe and southern Russia but not particularly deep into those countries. Obviously, we don't have very solid information on Iran's missiles, they don't release a lot of information but we think that their Shahab-3 has got a range about 1,300 kilometers while it's improved the version of Shahab-3A, it's stretched its length to get some more fuel into the tanks and they've cut the weight of the warhead by more than half; we think that can do up to 1,800 kilometers. Now if you look at the map of Europe, Volgograd is 1,100 kilometers from Iran and certainly Volgograd was in Europe the last time I looked. That sort of narrow range would get you just about to Istanbul; there's certainly no argument that bit of Turkey is in Europe, that's about 1,400 kilometers from just inside the Iranian border. If you move to the longer-range figure (1,800 kilometers), then you get more cities of East Europe starting to come into range. Eighteen hundred [kilometers] will give you Iran to Kyiv, just about Iran to Athens, I suspect, Iran to Bucharest. What about Iran's plans to develop longer-range missiles in the future? What kind of range are they trying to develop and how far could those missiles reach from Iran? In order to get to Moscow you would have to get a missile of 2,000 kilometers range. We hear rumors of such developments from Iran but nothing very firm. We honestly don't have any real hard information on Iran's future missile plans, we've heard talk of something allegedly called the Shahab-3B; the story is rather vague. The reports talked about 2,000-2,500-kilometer range. There've been reports [about] Shahab-4 [but] the Iranians have said there is no such thing as Shahab-4. We have seen some pronouncement that there is a Shahab-4 but it's not a missile, it's going to be a satellite-launch vehicle. So there's just no hard information. We know they are doing a lot of rocket development work, 2,500 would not quite get you to Rome, it would probably get you to Zagreb, Budapest, you'd get most of Slovakia, it would get you a bit into the Czech Republic [and] up to Warsaw, Minsk, and not quite St. Petersburg. Who is helping Iran develop its long-range missiles? It's largely being done, we think, with help from North Korea. But they are probably becoming much more self-independent and self-supporting. [Iran] needed help to get started with the Shahab, so they worked in conjunction with the North Koreans, who were working on their No-Dong missile program. But [Iran] has probably got enough expertise now to be able to do most of this themselves. Whether there is a fertilization path directly from Iran to Pakistan, that I don't know. I don't think anyone outside the world of the intelligence services [knows]. What do you think about Larijani's description of the U.S. [missile-defense plan] in Europe as "the joke of the year"? When politicians start talking about "jokes of the year," they are usually making political statements. Obviously, the U.S. Department of Defense must feel that it has credible evidence that Iran is working on much longer-range missiles, or has the capability to develop much longer-range missiles. Otherwise, it wouldn't be developing and putting this amount of money into potential defenses against them. Russia has said the U.S. missile-defense shield plans for Europe [are] targeted at the Russian missile system. Do you agree? The U.S. missile-defense shield is going to be a relatively small number of interceptors. It is focused very much on rogue states -- North Korea, Iran, countries that might be able to develop nuclear weapons and a small number of ballistic missiles. The Russians have been complaining recently that they see the plan to put U.S. ballistic missile interceptors in Poland as being aimed at their system. But the basic laws of geography suggest it is not. Ballistic missiles from Russia being fired, say, at the United States, are going to fly up over the polar region. They are going to go nowhere near Warsaw. So a ballistic missile interceptor fired from Poland would have a very hard time trying to catch a Russian missile because the Russian missile would be traveling at right angles to its flight path. Essentially, the inceptor would be doing a tail chase. It would be trying to catch something that is going faster than it is. It just wouldn't [be able to] do it. Do you think the U.S. missile-defense shield plans for Europe are meant to protect Israel and Europe from Iranian missiles in the future, or is it meant more as a protective shield for the United States? The full range performance of the American ballistic-missile [interceptor] system has simply never been released. They have not given any hard figures as to [its] range and height capability. If you look at where the missiles are being deployed, or [where] there is talk of them being deployed, and then start looking at the potential trajectories from Iran and North Korea to the continental United States, then those existing deployments and announced deployment sites make sense. That's what they are aimed to deal with -- attacks on the continental United States of America from either the Middle East and Iran area or from North Korea. If you plot a great circle trajectory -- as navigators call it -- from North Korea to different places in the USA, or from Iran to different places in the USA, you can see that those paths are getting close to the locations where America is planning to deploy its ballistic missile interceptors. archive news on Iran Iran: Rocket Launch Another Show Of Prowess Russia Says Iran Incapable Of Making ICBMs Russia: Moscow Confirms Missile-Systems Deal With Iran Q&A: How Close Is Iran To Getting Nuclear Bomb?

Police usually are quick to snuff out any memorials in Beijing for those killed in the crackdown that culminated in June 4, 1989, while China's government still calls the seven-week Tiananmen protest a counter-revolutionary riot and has yet to fully disclose what happened. But with China's human rights record under renewed scrutiny ahead of the 2008 Olympics, survivors of the bloody crackdown in Beijing marked the event's 18th anniversary on Monday by demanding political reform. And Ding, who for years was placed under house arrest during Tiananmen anniversaries and other sensitive times, wept on the eve of the anniversary as she placed a photo of her son on the spot where he died a few kilometers west of Tiananmen. "It's been 18 years and I felt like I let him down and let down the others who died with him," she said of her son, who was killed as he hid behind a flower bed from soldiers enforcing martial law on the night of June 3. He had turned 17 the day before. In Hong Kong on Monday &mdash; the only place in China where a large, public commemoration is allowed &mdash; tens of thousands gathered to mourn the dead at a candlelight vigil. In Beijing's Tiananmen Square, there were no immediate reports of protests and only tourists gathered to watch a daily flag-raising ceremony amid tight security. Ding, co-founder of the Tiananmen Mothers, a group that represents families of those who died, said police did not try to stop her Sunday night, though plainclothes agents may have been observing the vigil. "Right now, this is all I can do. Not getting justice for them, we're still pushing for it but there's been no response," said Ding, who has campaigned to get the government to acknowledge those killed in the crackdown and compensate their families. "Their spirits are obviously not at peace." Most of the surviving students who led the Tiananmen protests have drifted away from activism and into careers in business or other professions, but prominent student leader Wang Dan has continued to push for political reform in China as he pursues a doctorate in history at Harvard University. He said in a videotaped message that China's recent economic success cannot make up for the crackdown and killed hundreds, maybe thousands, of people. "Who can guarantee things that happened 18 years ago will not happen 18 years later?" Wang said. "Even if we become more powerful economically, China still cannot rise in international society." Another former student leader, Wu'er Kaixi, lamented that the memory of Tiananmen appears to be fading worldwide. "The Chinese government is unwilling to face the truth and seems to hope that the 'problem' of June 4 will simply go away," Wu'er, who has worked as a businessman and radio broadcaster in Taiwan, told The Associated Press. "For the most part, the world seems willing to go along with this." In the former British colony of Hong Kong, many residents in 1989 supported the Tiananmen protesters and the violence raised fears that the Communist leadership would not honor its promise to allow Hong Kong the civil liberties its people enjoyed under British rule. But 10 years after the hand-over, the city still enjoys freedoms that people on the mainland can only dream about. Street protests are common and the press frequently criticizes the government, though media watchdogs say self-censorship is common. A candlelight vigil Monday night filled up six soccer fields at Victoria Park near downtown Hong Kong. Amy Chan, 60, brought her 5-year-old granddaughter. "Although she is young, we need to let her know the history," Chan said. Tonny Chin, 50, a clerk, said he has attended the vigil every year since 1989. "The June fourth incident is a tragedy for China," he said. "We need to vindicate it." New York-based Human Rights Watch said Beijing's failure to account for the crackdown casts a pall on its campaign to project a new image ahead of the Olympics in 14 months. "Beijing &mdash; and by extension, the 2008 Olympic Games &mdash; will remain tarnished by this legacy until the Chinese government provides a complete and truthful account of what happened in June 1989," said Sophie Richardson, deputy Asia director of the human rights group.

Most of the high-profile student leaders involved in the pro-democracy demonstrations who did not go into exile have already been released. The list includes several men convicted of crimes no worse than "counter-revolutionary sabotage", a vague term often used to cover minor offences involving protests against property. In their statement, the group, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said those named were Beijing residents, some of whom were accused of participating in violent activities but who may have been involved only in peaceful protest or self-defence. As well as the thirteen in prison, all serving the equivalent of life terms, the statement gave ten names of those executed immediately afterwards. "Those who were sentenced to death, many of whom were executed immediately, or given long prison terms ... tended to be ordinary people or workers, while the world focused its condemnation on cases of jailed students and intellectuals," the statement said. The massacre remains a taboo subject within mainland China. It is one of the so-called "Three Ts", the others being Taiwan and Tibet, about which nothing can be said in the media without clear Communist Party direction. In line with annual practice, dissidents were put under house arrest in advance of the anniversary. "My house arrest this time probably will last till June 8," said Hu Jia, one of the most active of China's younger generation of activists, by telephone. He was prevented from travelling to Britain and other European countries last month. But older dissidents have reported a loosening of conditions this year. Chen Ziming and Ren Wanding, both 1989 veterans who served lengthy prison terms, were allowed to visit Hong Kong for the first time. Mr Ren told The Daily Telegraph today he had been left alone by the police for the first time this month. "I wasn't watched during the National People's Congrees meeting in March nor now. "They haven't given me any reason for that - they never do when they do nor when they don't. They just tell you nothing. "But I guess it's because of the Beijing Olympics next year, and the meeting of the 17th Communist Party congress later this year." He said he was optimistic that the gradual loosening would continue. "The government is not under tight pressure from outside. And there are no street demonstrations or movements in China," he said. Ding Zilin, a retired university professor who founded the "Mothers of Tiananmen" pressure group, was also today for the first time allowed to place a wreath on the spot where her son was killed. In Hong Kong, the only place in China where commemorative events are allowed, protesters held an annual vigil. The event was given extra momentum this year after Ma Lik, the leader of the main pro-Beijing political party in Hong Kong, gave an interview in which he denied that what happened was a massacre and suggesting that the territory could not be granted democracy until it showed "maturity" by accepting the official version. "I think his words were a useful marker for this year's anniversary," said Hu Jia, the activist. "We need to remind people what happened back then." Human Rights Watch said the Beijing government's refusal to reappraise its verdict on the massacre, that it was necessary to put down a counter-revolutionary riot, cast a shadow over the 2008 Olympics. Chinese Human Rights Defenders said three men who had been sentenced either to suspended death sentences or life in prison in 1989 had been released in 2006, partly as a result of pressure from the west, but were still deprived of full civil rights. They quoted the unnamed former prisoner who spent four years compiling the list as saying: "I want to tell those who claim that Tiananmen belongs to another era that, behind the high, barbed-wire-ringed walls of the Chinese prisons, Tiananmen prisoners are still suffering and forced to engage in hard labour, day and night, today."

But it turns out that New Hampshire actually had three small earthquakes over the weekend. The tremors caused no damage or injuries. The state Emergency Management Agency said the quakes were felt Saturday night and Sunday afternoon in the Portsmouth-Exeter area. The U.S. Geological Survey listed two of the quakes as magnitudes 1.4 and 1.9. A magnitude for the third quake was not available. Initially, officials investigated whether the sounds and tremors were caused by underground methane gas explosions, and the naturally occurring gas was found escaping from the ground in Portsmouth on Saturday. However, authorities were able to rule that out as the cause, Assistant Fire Chief Steven Achilles said. He said the methane gas discovery was either a coincidence or a result of the tremors. New Hampshire experiences an average of three to four earthquakes per year, most of them so minor they aren't even felt, said Jim Van Dongen, spokesman for the state Office of Emergency Management.

"It is not a situation where he can avoid justice by the simple election of staying in his cell. At the end of the day he is only hurting himself," Rapp told a press conference after the court adjourned on Monday. Taylor, 59, faces 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for allegations that he controlled and armed Sierra Leone rebels who went on a rampage of rape and mutilation against civilians during a decade-long civil war. Taylor refused on Monday to attend the opening of his trial and dismissed his lawyer, telling the court in a letter he would represent himself. Taylor and his defence have repeatedly complained they did not get enough resources to properly prepare for trial. "No trial can be hijacked by the accused person and be forced to stop or be put under the control of the accused person," Rapp said. "That said, I think it is very important that Mr Taylor has adequate and effective legal representation," he added. According to the prosecutor Taylor&#39;s defence team is already receiving double the amount available for other accused before the Sierra Leone tribunal.

BOSNIA: FAMILIES OF SREBRENICA VICTIMS SUE NETHERLANDS AND U.N. The Hague, 4 June (AKI) - The families of up to 8,000 Muslims killed in 1995 by Bosnian Serb forces in the eastern town of Srebrenica sued the United Nations and the Dutch state for failing to prevent the genocide. Marko Gericen, a lawyer for the grieving families, told journalists the case before the Dutch Supreme court "isn&#8217;t of a financial nature" but is intended to see justice done. Unfortunately, the UN and the Dutch government are not ready to assume responsibility and don&#8217;t even want to talk about it, he added. Srebrenica was a UN protected 'safe haven' when Bosnian Serb forces attacked it in July 1995, but the Dutch authorities refused crucial air support ordered by the UN for some 450 Dutch troops defending the enclave, enabling Bosnian Serb forces to abduct and massacre 8,000-10,000 Muslim men and boys, the families' lawyers said. Gericen said he would call as witnesses former UN secretary-general Boutros Ghali and Kofi Annan, to prove that the Dutch government ignored the UN order to use air support. The UN is also blamed in the suit for negligence and lack of action. &#8220;We want to show Europe what has been done to us, and demand from that same Europe only truth and justice,&#8221; Munira Subasic, president of an association of Srebrenica mothers told journalists. The suit coincided with the arrest of former Bosnian Serb general Zdravko Tolimir last week, on charges of genocide at Srebrenica. He was expected to make a plea before the Hague-based International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia on Monday. In a historic and controversial ruling in February, the top UN court, the Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) acquitted Serbia of genocide during the 1992-1995 Bosnian civil war. The tribunal found that Bosnian Serb forces did commit genocide and pronounced Belgrade guilty of failing to prevent genocide. Former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok resigned in 2002, after a report blaming Dutch soldiers for inaction at Srebrenica was made public. The report fingered Kok and his government for sending Dutch soldiers on an &#8220;impossible mission&#8221; in Bosnia during the civil war.

"This was a terrorist act," Deputy Defense Minister The attack came one day after a homicide car bomber drove through a roadblock guarding the prime minister's home and rammed the vehicle into a wall, killing seven people. The prime minister was unharmed. Germany, which holds the EU presidency, issued a statement Monday condemning the attack on the prime minister "as an assault on the whole peace and reconciliation process in Somalia" and saying a Somali working for the was among those killed. The EU presidency "`offers profound condolences to all those who have lost loved ones and wishes a speedy recovery to those who have been injured," the statement added. The violence in Mogadishu has undermined the government's claims to have defeated Islamic insurgents who have vowed to launch an Iraq-style guerrilla war unless Somalia becomes an Islamic state. The battles have pitted the government and Ethiopian troops propping it up against clan rivals and Islamic insurgents. said Monday that the attack targeting him over the weekend was meant to disrupt a peace and reconciliation conference planned for later this month. "The whole objective of the insurgents or the terrorists is to stop or delay the national reconciliation conference. We will not do it. We will continue," Gedi said outside his home, which was damaged in Sunday's blast. "We will try to pacify the capital city before the conference." Jelle has blamed the attack on "terrorists linked to Sunday's attack was at least the third attempt on Gedi's life since he returned to Somalia in May 2005. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks. The government's planned nationwide reconciliation conference has already been delayed several times because of violence. On Friday, Somali forces and shelling from a U.S. warship reportedly killed eight foreign Islamic militants in a remote, mountainous northeastern area of the country. Officials of the semiautonomous region of Puntland said that the foreign fighters killed in Friday's fighting included some from the United States, Britain, Sweden, Pakistan and Yemen. Somali fighters were also killed in the mountainous northeastern area of Bargal, but officials did not specify how many. Meanwhile, Somali pirates who hijacked a Taiwan-flagged fishing vessel in mid-May off this country's lawless coast killed one of the 16 crew members because the ship's owners have not paid a ransom, a maritime official said Monday. The pirates threatened to kill other crew members if their demands are not met, said Andrew Mwangura, head of the Kenyan chapter of the Seafarers Assistance Program. He cited a relative of one of the captives, who was allowed to call his family. "The gunmen have established contact with the owner of the ship but it appears that he was giving them empty promises," Mwangura said. The ship &#8212; Ching Fong Hwa 168 &#8212; had two Taiwanese and 12 Chinese crew members on board when it was hijacked 220 kilometers (137 miles) northeast of the Somali capital, Mogadishu. Mwangura did not know the nationality of the victim. Somalia does not have a coast guard or navy after more than a decade of anarchy. The current government was formed in 2004 but has struggled to assert any real control throughout the country. Somali pirates are trained fighters, often dressed in military fatigues, using speedboats equipped with satellite phones and Global Positioning System equipment. They are typically armed with automatic weapons, anti-tank rocket launchers and various types of grenades, according to the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia. Although piracy is rampant off Somalia's lawless coast, killing crew members is relatively rare, Mwangura said. He said pirates have killed four crew members in the past 10 years. "Normally they don't kill crew members if they cooperate," he said. Since February, pirates have hijacked 10 ships &#8212; five have been released and five are still being held, according to the Seafarers Assistance Program.

Kennedy Airport would have caused limited damage. WASHINGTON -- A Guyanese police official said Sunday that one of the four men charged with conspiring to trigger explosions at John F. Kennedy Airport was once the business partner of the leader of a radical Muslim group that tried to overthrow the Trinidad government in 1990. Acting Guyana Police Commissioner Henry Greene's comments bolstered reports that the man, Abdul Kadir, and the other suspects were seeking support from Muslim radicals in the Caribbean and elsewhere for their plans to attempt to blow up jet fuel pipelines and storage tanks at the New York City airport. But there is no evidence that they had succeeded in winning that support. The revelations of Kadir's ties to other Muslim radicals came as terrorism and pipeline experts cast doubt on U.S. authorities' depiction of the possible consequences of the alleged plot. Even if the plotters had succeeded in blowing up the fuel storage facilities or a pipeline, the damage would have been relatively contained, experts said. "The impact would be very limited indeed," said Peter Lidiak, the pipeline director at the American Petroleum Institute. Mike Ackerman, a security consultant in Miami, echoed that assessment. "Nothing could be as bad as the authorities made it sound," said Ackerman, a former CIA terrorism expert. "The fact is that pipelines are hit all the time. The leftists in Colombia have hit pipelines dozens, probably hundreds of times, and the technology is such that sensors in the pipelines shut them down. To suggest they'd blow up half of Queens and probably all the way to Pennsylvania was ridiculous." Ackerman also said the suspects were probably incapable of a large attack and that the group most likely to have assisted them, Trinidad's Jamaat al-Muslimeen, is not likely to have "the expertise that would have brought this to fruition." Greene, the Trinidad police commissioner, said Kadir, a former opposition member of Guyana's Parliament, had once been a business partner with Jamaat al-Muslimeen's leader, Yasin Abu Bakr. Twenty-four people died in the group's 1990 coup attempt. Greene, who is leading Guyana's investigation into the alleged plot, said Abu Bakr visited Kadir in Guyana at least once. He said he was unsure of the date of the visit but thought it was in the past two years. Shortly after the visit, Greene said, the two men became partners in a business exporting Guyanese lumber for fencing. Kadir, 55, and Kareem Ibrahim, 56, of Trinidad were arrested in Trinidad and are awaiting extradition to the United States. Russell Defreitas, a Guyana-born U.S. citizen, was arrested in New York. Abdel Nur, a citizen of Guyana, remains at large and is believed to be in Trinidad. Greene said Kadir studied Islam in Iran in the 1990s and is a Shiite cleric. He established the Guyana Islamic Information Center, which hosts Islamic scholars and lecturers from overseas, including Iran.

Sun Jun 03, 2007 at 06:03:54 AM EST Still Looking for Iraq's WMD U.N. team still looking for Iraq's WMD Though work is seen as irrelevant, Security Council can't agree to end it Every weekday, at a secure commercial office building on Manhattan's East Side, a team of 20 U.N. experts on chemical and biological weapons pores over satellite images of former Iraqi weapons sites. They scour the international news media for stories on Hussein's deadly arsenal. They consult foreign intelligence agencies on the status of Iraqi weapons. And they maintain a cadre of about 300 weapons experts from 50 countries and prepare them for inspections in Iraq -- inspections they will almost certainly never conduct, in search of weapons that few believe exist Poisoning the Troops, Again The Pentagon has a disturbing pattern of withholding information on the impact of chemical/biological weapons and other toxins on US service members. As a result, veterans are often told that their debilitating symptoms are "in their head" and can go decades without receiving medical help.That's not supporting our troops.

News Now NYer of the Week This Day in History NY1 Info & History On NY1 Now: Weather On 1 Weather: Mostly cloudy. High:71 Democratic White House Hopefuls Face Off In The Granite State Candidates in the Democratic presidential race debated for the second time Sunday night, with frontrunner Hillary Clinton trying to preserve a lead in the polls amid attacks on her vote for war in Iraq. NY1’s Josh Robin filed the following report. Her record on Iraq again under the microscope, Senator Hillary Clinton pointed fingers at the White House, rather than her Democratic rivals, as a crowded field of candidates took the stage in Sunday night’s Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire, the site of the first presidential primary. "This is George Bush's war,” said Clinton. “He is responsible for this war." It was one tactic the senator used Sunday night to try hold her advantage against her Democratic opponents, even as two new books scrutinize the front-runner. CNN played host at the forum, where Clinton faced off against seven others, including Illinois Senator Barack Obama and former North Carolina Senator John Edwards, who are polling nationally second and third respectively. Obama has emerged as an anti-war favorite, the only one of the three against it from the start, although he wasn't in the Senate during the 2002 authorization vote. But it was Edwards with the sharpest attacks on Sunday, carving away at the top pair. "They went quietly to the floor of the Senate; cast the right vote. But there is a difference between leadership and legislating,” said Edwards. "You want to name names,” asked the debate’s moderator, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. "No, I think it's obvious who I'm talking about,” said Edwards. That would be Clinton and Obama, who voted last month against continuing war funding, but, in Edwards' eyes, without enough effort at explaining their position. "I think all of us have a responsibility to lead on these issues,” said Edwards. Clinton grimaced. Obama retorted with one of the night's sharpest lines. "John, the fact is that I opposed this war from the start, so you're about four and a half years late on leadership on this issue,” he said. Clinton spent the two hours more subdued, an above the fray strategy casting herself as anti-Bush enough to win Democrats, but presidential enough to win it all. Still, new questions are rising that could block her from the nomination, like why she didn't read an entire intelligence briefing before the authorization vote, and will she apologize now for the vote. Here's as far as she'd go. "It was a mistake to trust George Bush, that he would do what he told all of us he would do,” she said. She also defended her husband's “don't ask, don't tell policy” on gays in the military. Clinton called it a transitional policy. But like all the other candidates, she supports overturning it, and letting homosexuals openly serve. The ten Republican hopefuls will debate in New Hampshire on Tuesday.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: June 4, 2007 , June 4—Two Lebanese soldiers and two militants were killed in fighting in Ain al Hilwe refugee camp in southern Lebanon early today, capping a night of violence in both northern and southern Lebanon. Skip to next paragraph The New York Times Fighting in the north at Nahr al Bared spread to Ain al Hilwe. The clashes sparked fears that a conflict in the Nahr al Bared camp on the outskirts of this northern Lebanese town may be spreading. Militants in the northern camp have been besieged by the army for more than two weeks. In a series of skirmishes that began Sunday afternoon, fighters of the Islamist group Jund al Sham opened fire on Lebanese army soldiers. The firefight that followed left numerous houses inside the camp ablaze and ultimately resulted in the death of the four men, military officials said. Meanwhile, 60 miles north at the Nahr al Bared camp, Lebanese troops continued their offensive against another militant group, Fatah al Islam, directing machine gun fire and artillery shelling into the camp for much of Sunday and early today. At least 114 people have been killed in the siege of the camp, which began when security men raided an apartment in Tripoli seeking bank robbers. A tenuous calm set in over both camps this afternoon as Palestinian and religious leaders sought to calm tempers in Ain al Hilwe, the southern camp, and to negotiate an end to the 16 days of violence at Nahr al Bared. Both camps are home to tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees displaced in the successive wars between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Palestinian factions held talks with the Lebanese army command in Sidon this morning, as heavily armed Jund al-Sham fighters agreed to cede their positions to militiamen from other Islamist groups at Ain al Hilwe, where more than 47,000 refugees live. Despite sporadic gunfire in Nahr al Bared, aid agencies worked to get water and food into the camp today. Red Cross officials said a few civilians had managed to escape the camp, while the aid agency warned that conditions inside were worsening significantly, and made an appeal for new funds to assist refugees who have escaped the camp. Thousands of refugees have escaped over the past two weeks, but aid groups estimate that about 6,000 residents remain trapped inside in the crossfire. Reporters have been banned from the camp and have been pushed back out of sight of the fighting, making it difficult to confirm reports from either side. The army continued to reinforce its positions around the camp today, and brought in armor, troops and supplies, possibly in preparation for another push against Fatah al-Islam.

First Read is updated throughout the day, so check back often. , NBC Political Director , NBC Deputy Political Director McCain jabs at Romney Posted: Monday, June 04, 2007 11:06 AM by Domenico Montanaro From NBCâ€™s Andrew Merten: This is not much different from what McCain said earlier, but we watched McCain's address on immigration reform in Coral Gables, Fla., this morning, and we wanted to update. McCain used the opportunity again to take some not-so-subtle jabs at GOP presidential opponent Mitt Romney. Without mentioning the former governor by name, McCain repeated his familiar challenge for a better alternative to the bill, saying, â€œIf someone objects to it, especially if they are a candidate for President, they should have the responsibility and courage to propose another way.â€ He continued, taking his rebuttal to Romney even further this time: â€œI would hope that any candidate for President would not suggest doing nothing. And I would hope they wouldn't play politics for their own interests if the cost of their ambition was to make this problem even harder to solve.â€ C'mon Mac. Politicians have sworn an oath on their Sacred Investment Portfolio, to make any problem as obfuscated as inhumanly possible, thereby creating even more room for indefinite ruminations by the Analyzing Think Tank Priesthoods, resulting in the inevitable Holy Kickbacks.

(Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 11:44 AM) I could apply the last paragraph to a question for all candidates about the national debt. Based on the campaign talk I've heard so far, all of them from both parties are intent on doing nothing, which will make the problem harder to deal with in the future. And they reason they don't talk about it - because controlling spending is bad politics - especially controlling to any degree that would allow us to start paying that monster down.

Somalia leader lashes out after bombing Accuses Al Qaeda in deadly blast Five soldiers and two civilians were killed by a car bomb detonated yesterday near the Somali prime minister's home. (ASSOCIATED PRESS) By Guled Mohamed, Reuters | MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi accused Al Qaeda of being behind a suicide bombing that killed seven people outside his home in Mogadishu yesterday and said its militants had to be eliminated. The bombing occurred just hours after an official said Western jihadists were among the dead from US missile strikes in northern Somalia. Five soldiers and two civilians were killed when the bomber detonated a vehicle rigged with explosives at the gates of Gedi's residence in a heavily guarded neighbourhood of the Somali capital. "I saw limbs nearly a kilometer from where the suicide bomber detonated," a police officer at the scene, asking not to be named, said by telephone. "We don't know how the suicide bomber managed to pass through undetected. . . . The wounded cannot be counted." African Union peacekeepers raced to the area and whisked the prime minister to safety. "This was a terrorist act by Al Qaeda that was meant to create fear," Gedi told a radio station. "We have been patient for so long. We can no longer cohabit with these terrorists. . . . We have to eliminate them." His interim administration is struggling to impose its authority on the anarchic Horn of Africa nation. Near daily attacks on government troops and their Ethiopian military allies are blamed on members of a defeated Islamist movement who have vowed to wage an "Iraq-style" insurgency. On Friday, a US warship fired missiles at a group of foreign fighters in the remote mountains of northern Somalia's semi autonomous Puntland. CNN said the target was an Al Qaeda suspect. The region's finance minister said yesterday six Islamists -- from the United States, Britain, Sweden, Morocco, Pakistan, and Yemen -- had been killed in the strikes and in gun battles with local forces. He gave no other details. In Singapore, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates declined to comment on the strikes, saying it was possibly an operation still in progress. A Somali jihadist group calling itself the Young Mujahideen Movement said it suffered no casualties in what it called the random US strikes and had killed 11 soldiers. The Web posting could not be immediately verified but was on a site used by Al Qaeda and other Islamists. Sources told CNN the strikes were the second in six months aimed at a suspect in the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 240 people. The United States launched air strikes in southern Somalia in January aimed at three top Al Qaeda suspects, killing other members of the group, US officials have said. They were believed to be in a group of Islamists who fled Mogadishu in January after being routed by Somali interim government forces and the Ethiopian military. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

The much publicized trial â€“ the first of an African head of state accused of war crimes by an international tribunal â€“ started June 4, 2007 in the United Nations special court for Sierra Leone in The Hague. Earlier this year, the trial was moved from Freetown, Liberia due to security concerns that the high profile case would reignite violence in theÂ region.Â  Taylor stands accused of 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity stemming from his role in arming rebel groups during the conflicts in Sierra Leone and in his own country Liberia between 1989 and 2003. He allegedly funded weapons purchases by selling diamonds smuggled to Liberia from Sierra Leone. If found guilty Taylor could receive a maximum life sentence, which he would serve in the United Kingdom. He has denied all charges against him. "It is with great regret that I must decline to attend any further proceedings in this case," Taylor said via a statement read to the court by his defense lawyer Karim Kahn. "At one time I had confidence in this court's ability to dispense justice. Over time, it has become clear that confidence has been misplaced. I will not receive a fair trial." In another dramatic development at the trial, Kahn told the court that he would no longer be representing Taylor after the former president withdrew his permission for representation. Kahn said that Taylor would apply to act in his own defense. The lawyerÂ subsequently left the court despite threats that he would be held in contempt should he do so, according to press reports. The trial is expected to last a year and a half and is scheduled to commence June 25. Information that means Business Â© Copyright 1982-2007 by Martin Rapaport.

"The president of the republic has decreed three days of national mourning ... During this period, flags will fly at half mast across the country," said a government statement broadcast by state media. A Togolese delegation has been sent to Freetown to enquire into the circumstances surrounding the accident, the statement added. The privately-owned Paramount Airlines helicopter exploded and caught fire while descending at Sierra Leone's main Lungi airport late on Sunday and crash-landed on the runway. Twenty passengers and two Russians, one a pilot and the other a flight engineer, were killed in the crash, while a Russian co-pilot survived, according to Paramount Airlines. Togo's Sports Minister Richard Attipoe was killed in the crash along with a group of football fans who had come out in support of Togo's national team, which beat Sierra Leone 1-0 earlier on Sunday in an African cup of Nations elimination match.

In the one-room office atop his nonprofit dairy, requests pour in from a steady parade of citizens of this economically blockaded city: money for school books, for kidney dialysis, for food. Hanbali directs an Islamic charity that dispenses millions of dollars a year, one of the last solvent, and credible, institutions in a bellwether Palestinian city where local government and most local business are weakened or in a state of collapse. The charity is funded by private donations as well as by income-generating businesses such as the state-of-the-art dairy plant, which supports about 1,300 families. The charity increasingly fills a void brought about by the collapse of the Palestinian Authority since the victory of the Islamist group Hamas in January 2006 parliamentary elections. The Hamas victory led to a virtual shutdown of aid to Palestinians since Israel, the United States, and Europe have no dealings with a group they consider terrorist, driving the local economy into a tailspin. Even though Hanbali, who is close to many Hamas activists, has less money to give away than ever (in large part because Palestinian-Americans won't send him money any more for fear of violating US antiterrorism laws), his authority has grown. The Al Safa Dairy Plant -- the centerpiece of Hanbali's Islamic charity -- tells the story of the West Bank in this decade: how homegrown religious fundamentalists, adept at building fortunes through competitive capitalist enterprise, and with a proven track record of fighting corruption and helping the needy, have in many places eclipsed traditional power players, like the Hamas militia and the old guard secular PLO. "The government, Hamas, Fatah, they exist somewhere over the horizon, beyond the sun," Hanbali said with a laugh in his office, after turning down an urgent request from a young woman to buy schoolbooks for a refugee camp. "But we are here living on the ground." Hanbali is chairman of the local "Zakat," or Islamic Alms Committee. Believers are expected to tithe at least 2.5 percent of their total wealth to charity -- one of the Five Pillars of Islam. While most of the leaders of the Nablus Zakat, like Hanbali and the mayor of Nablus, are not members of any political party, they are known as religious men who support the same Islamist political philosophy espoused by Hamas. Israel considers the distinction semantic, often identifying Islamist "independents" as Hamas activists. Just over a week ago, the Israeli military arrested 33 alleged Hamas members in the West Bank, including the mayor of Nablus. In the past decade, Yasser Arafat's secular Fatah movement was discredited, first by the failure of the Oslo peace process and then by the revelations of endemic corruption. Hamas won elections in January 2006 on a platform of " change and reform," but has failed to parlay an initial wave of support into an effective reform plan , spending most of its first year in control locked in a power struggle with Fatah. Zakats such as Hanbali's, which exist in every major city in the West Bank and Gaza, have meanwhile quietly gone about their business. In 2007, Hanbali said he has an alms budget of about $1.2 million to give away. The year before, he had $2 million, but in tight times a little money goes a long way. Hundreds of families, for instance, receive monthly grants of 10 Jordanian Dinars (worth about $14) -- not much, but enough to buy basic food staples such as flour and sugar. Yusra Ridha Sawafta, 37, is a typical Zakat beneficiary. She lives with eight relatives in an almost completely unfurnished apartment in downtown Nablus, owned by her brother. The Zakat's monthly grant pays for flour and rice. She and her nephews pick wild greens from the hill above their neighborhood to boil with their starch. "If the Zakat stops giving us money, we would only have God left to ask for help," she said. According to Mayor Adly Yaish of Nablus, about 70 percent of the city's residents live below the poverty line, but the Palestinian Authority and local government have virtually no funds to give the poor. Nablus's few remaining major employers, hobbled by Palestinians' decreasing purchasing power and by Israeli security closures that have isolated Nablus and its merchants from the rest of the West Bank. Hundreds of employees have been fired this year alone. The heavily indebted municipality focuses on the most Spartan level of services, keeping electricity and water flowing to the city even though the local government is more than a million dollars in arrears to Israeli utilities, and keeping the potholed roads passable. Yaish has struggled since taking office in December 2005 -- as an independent backed by powerful figures in both Hamas and Fatah -- to reverse the municipality's financial plummet, and at the same time to rout corruption. The mayor made his money as Nablus's Mercedes dealer. He is a firm believer in private enterprise, hustle (he appeals to foreign aid donors through a polished English-language website, ), and Islamic alms. On a recent workday at the municipality weeks before his arrest, he heard dozens of citizens' petitions in half an hour. A woman seeking help with a power bill she couldn't afford tried pressing a 20-dinar note into the mayor's hand, and seemed surprised when he rebuffed the attempted bribe. "Is that for my pocket? Take it to the finance department!" he bellowed. But most of the visitors to his office were asking for jobs, or help with utility bills; Yaish had to apologize to most of them, saying the city government couldn't afford to help them. His friend Hanbali also finds himself rejecting most supplicants for lack of funds. Donations to the Zakat, which was founded in the 1970s, dropped off markedly after 9/11, when Palestinians in the United States became hesitant to send money to an organization in the West Bank that the US government might consider suspicious because of the Islamists at its helm -- even though neither Hanbali nor the Nablus Zakat organization appears on any public US government terrorist blacklist. On a recent afternoon, most of the machinery at the Safa dairy plant was quiet. A year ago, Hanbali was shipping 60 tons of milk a day, ultra-pasteurized so as not to require refrigeration. Now, with the Palestinian demand crumbling, he is producing 14 tons of milk a day. A woman accosted him in a factory hallway, asking in an urgent whisper whether Hanbali would consider $14 subsidies for Nablus students below the poverty line. With 6,000 such students, the price would come to $84,000 -- far more than the Zakat can currently afford. Hanbali's approach to alms-giving has a decidedly capitalist bent, employing many of the same principles as the micro-credit schemes that have helped small entrepreneurs in the developing world. He says Islamic alms should encourage people to work, and should generate revenue instead of relying on tithe money. Hence the Al Safa Dairy Plant, a gleaming $5 million facility with brand-new machines to pasteurize milk, make yogurt, and package everything in sanitary plastic. Hanbali built the factory with donations from locals, the Palestinian Diaspora, and large gifts from wealthy Gulf Arabs. The idea, Hanbali said, was to create as many jobs as possible along the entire supply chain. The Zakat Committee gives cows to poor families (6,500 cows in the past six years); in turn, the dairy plant buys the milk. Another 76 people are employed at the plant, and Hanbali said the business indirectly brings income to hundreds of others. Much of the milk produced is donated to West Bank schools. Whatever money the business earns goes to the Alms Committee, or is reinvested in the dairy. If he were running Al Safa Dairy Plant as a private business, Hanbali said, he would fire all but a third of the employees, since the factory is operating so far below capacity. But he keeps everyone on the payroll, even if some end up doing make-work, such as mopping already clean floors or standing guard by the loading dock. Hanbali's view of religion appears less extreme than the most leaders of Hamas and other Islamist factions, but he maintains that Godlessness, not religious fundamentalism, is the biggest cause of Palestinian violence. He also proudly claims descent from Ahmad bin Hanbal, the 9th- century Islamist scholar and founder of the Hanbali school, the most strict and conservative school of Islamic jurisprudence. The Zakat has taken over functions that Hanbali believes normally should fall to the Palestinian Authority, but he doesn't mind that the poor of Nablus get help from a group inextricably linked to Islam and the Koran, and not from a secular government. "This is preventive medicine for terrorism," Hanbali said. "Poverty creates unbelief. The empty stomach doesn't accept guidance and morals." &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Paul confirmed that two men allegedly connected to a plot to blow up a fuel line that feeds New York's John F. Kennedy international airport were in custody in Trinidad, identify them as Abdel Kadir, a Guyanese Muslim and former member of the South American nation's Parliament, and Kareem Ibrahim, a 56-year-old Trinidadian. Paul also said officers were scouring the country to capture a third suspect. (AP Photo/Shirley Bahadur) PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad - A radical Islamic group known for launching a bloody 1990 coup attempt in Trinidad faced growing scrutiny at home and abroad well before an alleged U.S. terrorist plot focused new attention on it. The four suspects named on Saturday in the plot to attack John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York tried to enlist the help of Jamaat al Muslimeen, according to U.S. court documents. But the group, whose followers are largely black converts to Sunni Islam, has faded as a political force in Trinidad as its charismatic leader, Yasin Abu Bakr, fends off criminal charges of inciting violence. In 1990, Abu Bakr's group stormed Parliament and took the prime minister and his Cabinet hostage in a rebellion that left 24 dead , the only Islamic revolt in the Western Hemisphere. The rebels eventually surrendered and were later pardoned. Though they did have contact, Jamaat al Muslimeen is not accused of offering any support to the men involved in the plot to blow up the New York airport, its fuel tanks and a jet fuel artery. Analysts are not surprised. "They haven't identified themselves as a terrorist group," said Anthony Bryan, a senior associate at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. "They're identified more in terms of protection rackets in Trinidad and Tobago," said Bryan, who was doing research in Trinidad. The suspects allegedly traveled to this twin-island Caribbean nation off the coast of Venezuela to lobby Abu Bakr, but only one met with him. Heavy surveillance of the group and its leaders apparently made communication difficult. One suspect, Abdul Kadir, allegedly told an informant that he expected difficulty reaching out to Bakr because of the security. "Everybody is zooming in on him. So I don't know if he'll be available," Kadir said. Kadir, a former member of Guyana's parliament, and a second suspect were arrested on Friday in Trinidad, where police were searching for a third member of the alleged Muslim terrorist cell that planned to kill thousands by blowing up a jet fuel artery. A fourth suspect, a U.S. citizen native to Guyana, was arrested in New York. Trinidad and Tobago Police Commissioner Trevor Paul said Sunday that he had "no new information" to report on the search for the suspect at large, Abdel Nur of Guyana. In Guyana, an official and acquaintances of Nur said he had been deported from the U.S. in the late 1980s after a drug violation and called Americans "oppressors." Inspired by black nationalist movements in the United States and elsewhere, Jamaat al Muslimeen formed in the 1970s and built a private compound including a mosque and school. It has drawn followers among poor urban blacks but remained underground and the number of members is unknown. Abu Bakr, a former police officer who converted to Islam, blamed the government for widespread poverty that followed the collapse of world oil prices. Nur, the suspect at large, said Abu Bakr suggested during their meeting in Trinidad that he return later with others involved "to discuss the plan in detail," according to the U.S. court documents. He reportedly said he also wanted to conduct "checks" on the other plotters. Phone calls to Abu Bakr's office seeking comment went unanswered Sunday. Bakr's group, often accused of aiming to create an Islamic state in Trinidad, describes itself simply as a religious organization. It is not known to have international reach, although a member was convicted of trying to smuggle 70 assault rifles to Trinidad from Florida in 2005. Abu Bakr faces charges stemming from a 2005 sermon in which he called for war against all rich Muslims who refuse to pay zakaat, an Islamic tithe used to alleviate poverty. The following week, he was arrested by police who razed the group's compound and charged with sedition and incitement to violence. He was questioned but not prosecuted in connection with a 2005 series of at least four bombings in the capital Port-of-Spain. The FBI opened a permanent office in Trinidad in 2005, partially to investigate the unsolved bombings. At the time, FBI chief Robert Mueller said he had no reason to believe there were terrorist cells in Trinidad or Tobago, but said there are "persons of interest" living in the Caribbean nation. Nur was detained Feb. 13 by Guyanese detectives at the request of the FBI, fingerprinted, and released, according to a police commander in Guyana who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. After he was named as a suspect, police went to his house and seized Islamic books and documents including receipts from international money transfers, the commander said. Nur, a Muslim originally named Compton Eversley who is now in his late 50s, worked odd jobs for a foreign-exchange office and smoked drugs at night but appeared harmless, said Rudy Thorne, an employee of the rooming house where he lived in a low-income area of Guyana's capital, Georgetown. "He left for Trinidad about three weeks ago and did talk about Americans as oppressors," Thorne said. "Other than that he was very quiet." Colleagues of former lawmaker Kadir in Guyana have expressed disbelief that he could be involved in the alleged plot. The father of nine children including two Iranian-trained Islamic scholars, Kadir had never expressed extremist views or hatred of the United States, said James McAlister, who served with him in parliament. Associated Press writers Michael Melia in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Bert Wilkinson in Georgetown, Guyana, contributed to this report.

A series of demonstrations and exhibitions in Israel and the occupied West Bank will this week protest against the 40 years of Israeli occupation that human rights groups say have plunged the Palestinians into unprecedented poverty. After weeks of belligerency and brinkmanship by regional and international players, Israel launched what it called a preemptive strike in the early hours of June 5, 1967, and quickly faced off Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Six days later, the war ended with Israel the clear winner, its people brimming with joy, the Palestinians in shock and the regional geopolitical map cardinally changed. The 19-year-old Jewish state conquered the West Bank and east Jerusalem from Jordan, the Golan from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai peninsula from Egypt - an area three-and-a-half times larger than the state of Israel itself. The war marked what some in Israel have called its brightest moment, as the young state established military superiority and enlarged its borders. But others have called the war its biggest mistake, as Israel turned into an occupying power lording it over one million Palestinians - nearly half the population of Israel proper at the time. “Had we been able to transform the victory into peace, we might have been able to prevent the wars that followed,” Israel’s elder statesman Shimon Peres said. For Israelis, the image of their soldiers conquering east Jerusalem - and with it Judaism’s holiest site, the Western Wall which Jews had been prohibited from visiting since the creation of the state 1948 - was all-powerful. But the military triumph has been made to look like “one of history’s Pyrrhic victories” and has turned into “a calamity for the Jewish state no less than for its neighbours”, the Economist said recently. For Palestinians, the war marked the nadir of despair since the creation of the Jewish state: they came under Israeli occupation and their dream of a state of their own seemed to slip out of reach. “The hated enemy, who had driven the Palestinians from their homes in 1948, was now in control of their lives, lands, and property,” historian Benny Morris wrote. But it also mobilised their resistance movement and propelled the struggle onto the world stage. “The traumatic demolition of the status quo reawakened Palestinian identity and quickened nationalist aspirations in the conquered territories and in the Arab states,” Morris wrote in ‘Righteous Victims’. On the international stage, the war thrust the Arab-Israeli conflict back to the forefront, placing it smack in the middle of the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union. The war led to Israel’s only peace treaties with Arab countries: the 1979 treaty with Egypt, with the return of the Sinai, and in 1994 with Jordan after the Palestinian autonomy deal. “We understood Israel is the biggest regional power, you cannot destroy or remove it,” said Emad Gad, an analyst with the Cairo-based Ahram Centre for Strategic Studies. But the war also planted the seeds of the many deep-rooted problems that generations of diplomats have found impossible to untangle in their search for peace - from the Jewish settler movement to sovereignty over the Holy City. These obstacles have torpedoed numerous international efforts to resolve the conflict, with peace talks moribund since the failure of Camp David talks in 2000 and little progress on a recently revived Arab peace plan that offers Israel normal ties in return for a withdrawal from occupied land and a return of Palestinian refugees. The war still casts a shadow over US diplomacy, with Washington struggling to navigate between its traditional staunch support for Israel and desire to build bridges to the Arab world. “It is scandalous the occupation has persisted since 1967.  This conflict should have been resolved long ago, and its continuation is an indictment of all involved,” from the warring parties to the big powers, said The Economist. Israel has plunged the Palestinians into unprecedented levels of poverty and despair during 40 years of occupation, yet failed to ensure its own security, Amnesty International has claimed. While acknowledging Israel’s “legitimate security concerns”, the London-based human rights group said the Jewish state could not justify building its security barrier inside parts of the West Bank and condemned its settlement policies. If Israel just wanted to keep out suicide bombers, Amnesty added, it would have only built the barrier along the Green Line that marked its boundary with the West Bank until Israeli forces invaded in the June 1967 war. “Yet, the reality is that most of it is being built on Palestinian land,” Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa Programme director Malcolm Smart said, adding that the Israeli barrier defies the International Court of Justice and separates Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank. His organisation said Palestinians are also restricted by more than 500 checkpoints and blockades as well as a network of roads reserved solely for settlers and linking settlements with Israel proper. The policies are aimed at benefitting “continuously expanding but unlawful Israeli settlements” while causing the “virtual collapse of the Palestinian economy”, the human rights group charged. They are also “exacerbating the increasingly fragile conditions in which Palestinians live and work - resulting in levels of despair, poverty and food insecurity never before seen in the” territories, he said. “Most Palestinians are now relying on aid for subsistence, with families reducing the quality and quantity of the food they consume and selling assets essential for their livelihoods,” he added. Israeli actions, Amnesty said, have “resulted in widespread human rights abuses and have also failed to bring security to the Israeli and Palestinian civilian populations”.

"Two policemen were shot dead in Bakara (market)by unidentified gunmen who we suspect to be Islamists," a police officer told Xinhua. He asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Four civilians including two women were also shot dead while six others were wounded including three policemen in Mogadishu's biggest Bakara market, Omar Daahir, a businessman in the market, told Xinhua. "The police are shooting at the people after two of them were killed," Daahir said. "Four people were killed in the market, two were women. The six injured were rushed to the hospital." The situation in and around the market remains tense with the Somali security forces keeping guard at the main roads leading to the market and business people closing their premises. These latest killing in the capital came as the government promised to improve security in the capital after Sunday's suicide attack targeting the house of Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi, in the north of the capital. At least seven people were killed and ten others were wounded in the attack, most of them bodyguards of the prime minister. There has been an upsurge of violence in Mogadishu lately, blamed on Islamist fighters by the Somali government, which was formed in the n capital Nairobi in 2004 as a result of a national reconciliation conference there. The Horn of Africa nation has been without a central authority for more than 16 years since the overthrow of the ruler Mohamed Siyad Barre in 1991 when the country fell into chaos and lawlessness.
