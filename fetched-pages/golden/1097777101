They said the blueprint was tentatively due to be published on June 4, two days before President Hu Jintao attends a meeting of Group of Eight leaders in Germany at which global warming will be high on the agenda. The officials, briefing reporters on condition they not be identified, staunchly defended China&#x2019;s record in tackling climate change. But they reaffirmed Beijing&#x2019;s rejection of compulsory caps on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that scientists say are heating the planet. &#x201C;A mandatory quota for China now would not be fair and therefore China cannot accept that,&#x201D; said one official who helps direct Beijing&#x2019;s climate change policy. China looks set to become the world&#x2019;s top emitter of carbon dioxide this year or next, just as serious talks start to extend the UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol on global warming beyond 2012. German Chancellor Angela Merkel hopes the G8 summit, in the Baltic resort of Heiligendamm, will pave the way for an extension of the protocol by agreeing on concrete steps to tackle emissions. China&#x2019;s objection to mandatory caps, which is shared by the US, underscores the difficulty she faces. Beijing argues that rich nations pumped out most of the carbon dioxide already accumulated in the atmosphere and so they should cut their own emissions rather than push poorer nations to accept caps that could constrict their growth. &#x201C;Developed countries are to blame for climate change, but resolving this issue needs cooperation among all countries based upon on their different responsibilities, their capacity and their level of economic development,&#x201D; a second official said. China&#x2019;s emissions per capita of its 1,3 billion population are only one-fifth as high as America&#x2019;s, officials said. What&#x2019;s more, they said, between 1991 and 2005 China reduced the amount of energy used to produce each unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by 47% &#x2014; a conclusion corroborated by the Paris-based International Energy Agency. &#x201C;This cannot be matched by any other country during this period, including the European Union,&#x201D; the first official said. Since 2003, however, this measure of &#x201C;energy intensity&#x201D; has rebounded, and China has been fighting to restore the downtrend. A strong government campaign produced a 1% reduction in 2006 and China is sticking to its target of cutting 2005 levels by 20% by 2010. &#x201C;This goal is quite high, but we have the capability to reach it,&#x201D; he said. Among other steps, China aims to increase the proportion of energy produced from renewable sources, such as hydro and solar power, to 10% of the total by 2010. The officials gave no details of the content of the climate change plan, but sources who saw an earlier draft said China&#x2019;s political leaders appeared wary of making commitments they might not be able to keep. While an internal assessment of the risks to China from global warming proposed the country&#x2019;s first targets to curb emissions growth &#x2014; in the form of a target for &#x201C;carbon intensity&#x201D; &#x2014; officials told Reuters last month that the national plan probably would not include concrete targets. Under the carbon intensity target, which is less demanding than a goal for an outright cut in greenhouse gases, China would reduce its emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide per unit of GDP by 40% from 2000 to 2020. The G8 summit will also focus on fostering growth in Africa and global economic cooperation. The main members of the club - the US, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Russia - have invited China, India, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico to an &#x201C;outreach session&#x201D;. India, one of the world&#x2019;s top-five greenhouse gas emitters, also opposes binding emissions targets. It says global warming is the fault of industrialised nations, which should commit to deep emissions cuts first rather than pressuring developing countries. Asked whether China risked being labelled &#x201C;Mr No&#x201D; for its opposition to emission caps and a refusal to let the yuan rise more quickly, a third official said Hu would work to tackle global challenges, including economic imbalances. &#x201C;China won&#x2019;t be a Mr No. We want to be a Mr Cooperation and Mr Partnership,&#x201D; he said.

Robert Zoellick is a veteran of Washington's and Wall Street's top levels. As a US government official, he helped negotiate the reunification of Germany in 1990 and later smoothed China's entry into the World Trade Organization. More recently, he's brokered business deals throughout Asia as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs. But now he's in line for a job that might be the toughest of his career: head of the World Bank. He'll have to heal rifts opened by the ouster of current bank president Paul Wolfowitz, while tackling the crucial issue of poverty in the world's poorest countries. And he'll be working in a truly international institution â€“ an environment perhaps like none he's experienced before. "The World Bank poses a management challenge. This isn't like managing a private company," says Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. "The staff does not work for you. You can have the best ideas, and if you can't get them executed, it doesn't accomplish anything." Mr. Wolfowitz is stepping down in the wake of findings by a special bank panel that he violated bank rules in arranging a transfer and salary increase in 2005 for his companion, Shaha Riza, a bank employee. Controversy over Wolfowitz divided bank employees and strained US relations with European nations, which favored his ouster. At a White House ceremony Wednesday announcing his nomination, Mr. Zoellick acknowledged the bank's recent difficulties. "For all involved there are frustrations, anxieties, and tensions that could inhibit the future," Zoellick said. "This is understandable but not without remedy." The bank needs to get past this discord, he added. "I believe the World Bank's best days are still to come," he said. Zoellick's nomination must still be approved by the bank's 24-member board of directors. However, according to an informal tradition observed since the founding of the world's current international financial organizations in the wake of World War II, the United States chooses the head of the World Bank, while Europeans pick the leader of the International Monetary Fund. Some experts had hoped that following Wolfowitz's problems, the US would opt to change this method of governance and open up the World Bank selection process â€“ perhaps by submitting a list of candidates from which the bank board could pick.

http://www.greeleytrib.com/article/20070531/NEWS/70531002&cid The Tribune - News You Pick The News Hurricane forecast remains same FORT COLLINS — Colorado State University hurricane forecasters today maintained an earlier forecast that called for a very active 2007 season with a 74 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the U.S. coastline. The hurricane forecast team is calling for 17 named storms forming in the Atlantic basin June 1-Nov. 30. Nine of the storms are expected to become hurricanes with five becoming intense hurricanes with sustained winds of 111 mph or greater. The entire report is available on the Web at No hurricanes made landfall along the U.S. coastline in 2006. The 2006 season witnessed a total of 10 named storms, five hurricanes and two major hurricanes. Long-term averages are 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes per year. "We expect an above-average hurricane season with ENSO conditions on the cool side, which will help increase the likelihood of major storm activity in the Atlantic," said Phil Klotzbach of the Colorado State hurricane forecast team and the lead author of the forecast. "El Nino conditions during the summer and fall - similar to those that developed in 2006 - tend to decrease Atlantic hurricane activity by increasing vertical wind shear across the area where Atlantic tropical cyclones develop." The hurricane forecast team predicts tropical cyclone activity in 2007 will be 185 percent of the average season. By comparison, 2005 witnessed tropical cyclone activity that was about 275 percent of the average season.

Apologies to Indonesia anger Balibo families Governor of Jakarta Sutiyoso and Australian Ambassador for Indonesia Bill Farmer talk to the press following a meeting in Jakarta. Dark past behind a would-be president Should Australia apologise to Indonesia over the Balibi inquiry? Apology helps avert crisis Brendan Nicholson and Mark Forbes A POWERFUL Indonesian politician at the centre of a diplomatic stoush with Canberra has received personal apologies from the Australian ambassador and NSW Premier Morris Iemma, apparently defusing the row. Ambassador Bill Farmer visited Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso at his office yesterday to express "deep sympathy" over an incident involving the governor in Sydney this week. Mr Iemma, whose Government hosted the governor in NSW, also wrote to him late yesterday apologising for "distress and inconvenience caused" during his stay. Governor Sutiyoso, a prospective Indonesian presidential candidate, stormed out of Australia on Tuesday after he was confronted by NSW police at his hotel and asked to testify at the inquest into the 1975 Balibo incident in East Timor. The governor claimed police barged unannounced into his room at the Shangri-La Hotel while he was resting. But a relative of one of the five Australian newsmen killed as Indonesian troops invaded East Timor in 1975 last night expressed his disgust at the apologies. "The families have been waiting for 32 years for an apology for what is now recognised as an international war crime," said John Milkins, the son of Channel Seven cameraman Gary Cunningham. "Now we have the same excuse that saw them murdered in the first place: the national interest. "Are we going to let justice and the Geneva Convention be thrown out in favour of gutless toadying to Indonesian Government pressure? &#133; The coroner and an individual police officer are being hung out to dry by the federal and state governments." One of the two officers involved, Detective Sergeant Steve Thomas, is now on leave and the subject of an inquiry. The police were sent to the hotel by Deputy NSW Coroner Dorelle Pinch after she learned the governor of Jakarta was in Sydney and decided she would seek his testimony at the inquest into the death of Brian Peters, one of the newsmen killed in East Timor. Governor Sutiyoso was the deputy commander of a special forces unit during the 1975 invasion but has denied any connection to the deaths. His story about the hotel intrusion was backed yesterday by a hotel employee, who said police ordered a senior staff member to use a master key to gain entry. "They demanded access to the guest room," the employee told Mr Iemma, in his letter of apology, said he had been advised there was a breakdown in communications between state agencies. "I apologise for the distress and inconvenience caused and regret your early departure from NSW," he wrote. As anti-Australian protesters gathered outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta for the second day, Mr Farmer visited Governor Sutiyoso at Jakarta's city hall to apologise. Governor Sutiyoso said later he had forgiven Mr Farmer. "Before me and my staff he has extended an apology, his shock and his disappointment," he said. "We are a big-hearted nation. If they have extended an apology, we should not do things that are beyond the limit. We should repair the relationship." Foreign Minister Alexander Downer phoned his Indonesian counterpart, Hassan Wirajuda, to tell him an investigation was under way. He said the Jakarta Governor was "of course, outraged" after the police officers walked into his room. "Australians have to understand the concept of humiliation in Indonesia," Mr Downer said. "As the Indonesians would see it, this is an enormous humiliation for a major Indonesian figure." In Jakarta, Foreign Ministry head Imron Cotan said he believed the issue would be overcome by the apologies. But he expressed concern over reports that the Sydney coronial inquiry could recommend that two former Indonesian army officers face war crimes charges. The hotel incident received front-page coverage in Jakarta, with several newspapers suggesting the governor was the victim of a conspiracy. While the apologies appeared to defuse the diplomatic row, they sparked anger among critics of Australian policies towards Indonesia. Academic Damien Kingsbury said Australia had a history of placating Jakarta. "If we were a bit more frank in the first instance, we wouldn't then have these kind of problems," said Dr Kingsbury, an associate professor at Deakin University. Businessman Ian Melrose, who has financed advertisements about Indonesia's human rights record in East Timor and West Papua, said: "Five Australian journalists are killed and we apologise to the Indonesian Government.

Russian denies involvement in Litvinenko killing Published: May 31, 2007 The Russian businessman Britain has accused of murdering a former KGB agent, Alexander Litvinenko, denied involvement Thursday, saying that British intelligence agents, the Mafia and a self-exiled Russian multimillionaire were more likely suspects. In the latest twist to a murder case that has revived memories of the Cold War and strained British-Russian relations, the suspect, Andrei Lugovoi, sought to parry the accusations against him. "Britain is making me a scapegoat," Lugovoi, a former KGB bodyguard, said at a news conference in Moscow that was broadcast live on state television. He said that he did not know for certain who had killed Litvinenko with radioactive polonium in London last November, but that he could think of three possible suspects: British intelligence, the Mafia and Boris Berezovsky, a multimillionaire who fled Russia for Britain after repeated criticism of President Vladimir Putin and open admissions that he hoped to fund a political revolution in Russia. Lugovoi accused both Litvinenko and Berezovsky of working for British spy agencies and he charged that the murder was linked to such activity. Russian denies involvement in Litvinenko killing Bicycle programs catching on in major cities Europe leads in designing buildings that save energy Asked whether he had firm proof of British intelligence involvement in the murder, Lugovoi replied "Yes." He offered no details. Lugovoi knew Litvinenko for several years and both worked in the 1990s in Moscow for Berezovsky. Britain said Thursday that its request for Lugovoi&#039;s extradition, which Moscow said it cannot honor, had nothing to do with British intelligence. "This is a criminal matter and is not an issue about intelligence," a Foreign Office spokesman said. "A British citizen was killed in London and U.K. citizens and visitors were put at risk." Berezovsky was not available for comment. Litvinenko, a former Russian Federal Security Service officer who obtained British citizenship, said in a statement made public after he died that Putin was behind his poisoning. The Kremlin has described that charge as nonsense and has accused its opponents living abroad of using the case to damage Russia&#039;s image.

Suspect Blames British For Spy's Death Litvinenko Died Of Poisoning By Rare Radioactive Isotope POSTED: 2:49 am PDT May 31, 2007 The Russian businessman whom Britain has named as a suspect in the killing of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko said Thursday that he has evidence of British special services' involvement in the poisoning death. "Even if (British special services) hadn't done it itself, it was done under its control or connivance," Andrei Lugovoi told a news conference. Asked if he had evidence for the allegation, he said "I have evidence" but did not elaborate. A British government security official, who demanded anonymity in exchange for discussing Lugovoi's claims because of the sensitivity of the case, said suggestions British intelligence had involvement in Litvinenko's death were spurious. Britain last week said it had enough evidence to charge Lugovoi, who also worked for the KGB and its main successor agency the FSB, in the November killing of Litvinenko. Litvinenko, who died of poisoning by the rare radioactive isotope polonium-210, had fled to Britain several years earlier after becoming a strong critic of the Kremlin and received British citizenship. Lugovoi and another Russian had met in London with Litvinenko on Nov. 1, the day Litvinenko said he became ill. Britain has requested Lugovoi's extradition, but Russia has refused, saying the constitution does not permit such extraditions. Lugovoi has repeatedly asserted he is not guilty in the matter. On Thursday, Lugovoi also claimed that Britain had tried to recruit him to provide intelligence. British special services "asked me to collect compromising information on President (Vladimir) Putin," Lugovoi said. Lugovoi said the attempted recruitment occurred during business trips to Britain in previous years. He did not give a precise date, but indicated the alleged approach occurred in late 2005 or early 2006. London's Foreign Office, responsible for the country's overseas secret intelligence service MI6, declined to comment on Lugovoi's claim. But another government official with knowledge of Lugovoi, who also demanded anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, said the allegations were untrue. . All rights reserved.

In a clear reference to the United States, he harshly criticised "dictate and imperialism" in global affairs and warned that Russia will strengthen its military potential to maintain a global strategic balance. "It wasn&#039;t us who initiated a new round of arms race," Putin said when asked about this week&#039;s missile tests at a news conference after talks with Greek President Karolos Papoulias.

Get the lowdown on all the latest releases in the pages of our Today section Thursday, 31 May, 2007 Place a Classified Ad Top 5 on Web FOR SALE: Quads Easter Poster Drive -- Spring Edition Mike Harris used racist slur: Ipperwash report Thu, May 31, 2007 Also finds former Ontario premier did not interfere in park occupation The head of the Ipperwash inquiry has ruled that former premier Mike Harris told a high-level meeting on the day Dudley George was killed that "I want the f---ing Indians out of the park." But Justice Sidney Linden also found that while Harris's comment was "racist" and the premier was critical of police, Harris did not interfere or give inappropriate directions to the police at Ipperwash. "Although one may disagree with his views, it was legitimate for the Premier to take the position that the First Nations people were illegally occupying the park, and that he wanted them out of Ipperwash Park as soon as possible." Harris had denied he made such a remark during his testimony at the inquiry, but Linden wrote that after carefully reviewing the evidence he believed Harris said it. Linden, who had been urged by the police union to find that Dudley George was armed with a gun when he was shot, found that Dudley George did not have a gun on the night he was killed by Acting OPP Sgt. Ken Deane. "Ken Deane's assertion that Dudley threw his rifle on the ground is implausible," wrote Linden. "I accept the evidence of the aboriginal people that the occupiers did not have guns at the park during the confrontation with police." Four years in the making, the 1,500-page report of the judicial inquiry into the police shooting of native protester Dudley George on Sept. 6, 1995 contains 98 recommendations, covering future police operations and federal and provincial government relations with natives. George was part of a group of natives who had moved into the park after it was closed for the season, claiming it was the site of a native burial ground, an assertion that was later confirmed by the federal government. Based on recorded conversations and radio transmissions, Linden found that the racism and cultural insensitivity among some members of the Ontario Provincial Police contributed to the lack of a timely, peaceful resolution to the Ipperwash occupation. "There is no place for racial taunts or slurs of any type by police officers," Linden wrote. Police who were ordered to the park on the night of Sept. 6, 1995 were acting on mistaken and unverified information, the report said. "The OPP's assessment of the risk at the park was incorrect. This mistake had severe and tragic repercussions." In the early part of the native occupation, the police commander and other officers spent an inordinate amount of time and effort on armoured vehicles, weapons and other equipment, valuable time taken away from important issues such as speaking to a negotiator, Linden wrote. The report calls for the OPP to ensure the involvement of First Nation police services and mediators when it responds to future aboriginal occupations and protests. Linden also calls for the OPP to issue a public apology to Cecil Bernard George for the blows to his head and face at the hands of one or more unidentified police officers when he was arrested in the sandy parking where Dudley George was shot. A Kettle Point band councillor, Cecil Bernard George hadn't been part of the occupation, but was arrested during the clash between natives and police. "The apology should be delivered in person by the current Commissioner, or his delegate, and via a press release and conference," Linden said. In a blunt recommendation, Linden calls for the federal government to immediately return the former army camp to the peoples of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation and guarantee it will assume complete responsibility for an appropriate environmental clean-up of the site. "The federal government should issue a public apology with appropriate compensation to the Kettle and Stony Point First Nation for the failure of the federal government for more than 60 years to honour its promise to return the lands to the First Nation." Linden also recommends the creation of a permanent, independent and impartial agency, the Treaty Commission of Ontario, to oversee the settling of native land claims in Ontario. "The single biggest source of frustration, distrust, and ill-feeling among aboriginal people in Ontario is our failure to deal in a just and expeditious way with breaches of treaty and other legal obligations to First Nations. If the governments of Ontario and Canada want to avoid future confrontations like Ipperwash or Caledonia, they will have to deal with land and treaty claims effectively and fairly," the report said. In his report, Linden refers to "missed opportunities" during the Ipperwash crisis by government officials, including the burial-ground issue raised by the native protesters. "Had more effort been exerted, had more concern been attached by political staff and civil servants to this issue, and had there been due diligence, government officials would have realized that documents stored for decades in the basement of the Whitney Block showed that the First Nations people had voiced their concerns about these burial grounds," the report notes. As for the future of Ipperwash Provincial Park, which still remains occupied by the natives, Linden said allowing the status quo to continue "is not in anybody's interest." "It is a tribute to the patience and restraint of the occupiers and the local residents that there have been no serious, adverse incidents since 1995. But this unresolved status should not continue," the report said. But Linden wrote there are no perfect solutions and it wouldn't be acceptable if the park were re-opened unilaterally by the Ontario government as a provincial park. One possiblity, he suggests, is a co-management arrangement with the native community that would see the park operated by the aboriginals for the benefit of all Ontarians and visitors. Other recommendations of the inquiry include: - Public education about treaties to improve relations. "At the very least, every Ontarian should understand that this province and our country were built upon the treaties negotiated with our First Nations, and that everyone shares the benefits and obligations of those treaties. Every Ontarian should also realize that treaties are not historical artifacts from some distant past. They remain vitally important and relevant today." - Ontario should create a Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs to administer and support a revitalized land claims process.

Chance of a challenge to Bush's man Bob Zoellick: The world in his hands. US PRESIDENT George Bush's nominee as head of the World Bank, Bob Zoellick, is virtually certain to be ratified by the bank's board after June 15. But developing nations could nominate a candidate as a protest against the convention that gives the US the right to name the bank's head. President Bush said Mr Zoellick had a distinguished career in diplomacy and development economics. "He's a committed internationalist," he said. "He is deeply devoted to the mission of the World Bank. He wants to help struggling nations defeat poverty, to grow their economics and offer their people the hope of a better life." The World Bank board said it welcomed the nomination of Mr Zoellick, a former diplomat and economist, who has served as US deputy secretary of state, and former special trade representative in the Bush Administration. But it reiterated its stance that nominations were open until June 15 and board meetings would be held to consider all nominations. This leaves open the possibility of a repeat of events at the International Monetary Fund in 2004 when a group of developing nations put forward another candidate against the European nominee, Rodrigo de Rato. The move would be little more than a protest because Germany, which led the charge for the removal of the former president Paul Wolfowitz, is believed to have indicated that Mr Zoellick would be acceptable. In Canberra, Treasurer Peter Costello said Mr Zoellick would be "an excellent candidate". The French Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner, also backed the appointment. "Mr Zoellick is certainly the right man for the job," he said. But he said Mr Zoellick would need to regain the trust of the international community following the Wolfowitz scandal. The World Bank has been paralysed by controversy over Mr Wolfowitz's handling of a pay package for his girlfriend. But long before that, Mr Wolfowitz was seen as a controversial character, particularly by the European representatives on the bank because of his role in driving the Iraq war policies of the Bush Administration. Even this week, Mr Bush was still backing Mr Wolfowitz, describing him as "an able public servant" and "a man of character and integrity". But in the bank, Mr Wolfowitz proved a divisive figure &#151; he had strong views about fighting corruption by suspending loans to countries without transparent banking systems &#151; and morale among the 10,000 staff is said to be low. Mr Zoellick promised to tackle that issue: "We need to put yesterday's discord behind us and to focus on the future together," he said. Although Mr Zeollick is also a Bush Administration insider, he also enjoys a strong reputation as a capable and intelligent diplomat. He was instrumental as US trade representative in establishing the Doha Round of trade talks, and has been a strong advocate of free trade agreements, including the US-Australia agreement. Mr Zoellick has also been involved in diplomatic efforts in the Darfur region of Africa and other initiatives to fight poverty, something President Bush was keen to highlight. "Bob has had a strong voice for Africa," he said. "He wants to help struggling nations defeat poverty to grow their economies and offer their people the hope of better life." But not all are flattering about Mr Zoellick, with his critics pointing to some personal failings, particularly a propensity to tirades and a strong view on almost everything. Mr Zoellick's penchant to lecture, point by point, with little concern for editorial compression, is said to have irritated his boss, Condoleezza Rice, in the State Department, even though she had a huge regard for his intellect.

The latest deaths bring US casualties for the month to 119, the most since November 2004 when marines launched a full-scale invasion to retake the city of Fallujah in the volatile western Anbar province. April was also bloody for the US-led coalition, with 104 deaths. Taken together, the two past months have been the deadliest since the March 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. The news will increase pressure on US President George W. Bush, who has already seen domestic support for his war strategy fall to an all-time low and is facing calls to set a timetable for troops' withdrawal. Meanwhile, the hunt intensified for five Britons who were snatched at gunpoint from a finance ministry building in the capital earlier this week, in an abduction that has been blamed on Baghdad's Shi'ite militias.

Yaþar Büyükanýt said a military operation in northern Iraq is necessary and they wait for a relevant decision to be made by political mechanism. While the heaviest military build-up of recent years goes on in the Iraq border in eastern Turkey, preparations for a possible operation were launched. The retired general at a key post to provide cooperation and communication between Turkey and the U.S. regarding the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party's (PKK) terror, removed from office by the government. Last week's suicide bombing in Ankara and confessions of terrorists caught in numerous cities in this process strengthened the conviction that the PKK targets big cities. The violation of Turkish airspace last week by two U.S. F 16s created the impression that the government and armed forces are at odds. And finally, Kurdish administrators in northern Iraq made statements in the meaning “Turkish tanks cannot find way to these lands.” Operation by press releases?: Undoubtedly the key issue needs to be clarified here is the situation that produces reservations about politics-military relations and confuses the minds. By all means, neither from the military nor the politics perspective sharing thoughts about an imaginary military operation through press releases is normal. It is even needless to say that this is against the traditions of Turkish Army and the general principles of military professional. And only to know this requires a deduction that something is odd, there is something unusual. If you ask, what is “unusual”, my answer would be: The U.S. factor&#8230; Let me elaborate this a bit more: In the good old days, “Army to Iraq” meant a “hot pursue” or a “cross border operation”. And in legal perspective, all military operations before the U.S. invasion in Iraq were held by the approval of Baghdad and in the frame of mutual agreement with the neighboring country. But now, the situation has changed. Neither the approval of Baghdad nor of Washington is the point at issue. To the opposite, statements made by both capitals give the impression of an objection and even an implicit/explicit threat against Turkey. Therefore regardless of the decision by political body in Ankara depends on the ground of “terror” it will blatantly have the characteristic of a “declaration of war”. Intervention at all odds?: Let me get to the point. I am of the opinion that the public impression of a communication break down between the military and the politics stems from that the Turkish army will be facing the U.S. forces in northern Iraq. Because the presence of Kurdish peshmerga in northern Iraq does not justify who the dominant power is in the region. Therefore it is reasonable to explain the limped communication between the Turkish Armed Forces and the government by the desire to reach a prompt conclusion in the diplomatic initiatives with Washington. Observation of escalating desire “intervention at all odds” in the Turkish army might strengthen the hands of foreign affairs having hard time to express itself in Washington. But if you ask the question whether the army will enter Iraq, the answer of course will be it is possible if suicide bombings similar to the one in Ankara continue. Apparently as long as the investigation about the suicide attack of Anafartalar Avenue in Ankara is in progress, opportunities will rise to make some new assessments beyond clarifying the incident as an attack by the PKK. I previously mentioned that there are some groups in Washington making calculations to provoke Turkish military and dragging it into the quagmire in Iraq. And the military will be worn out in a “nightmare period”, civilian decision making mechanism will be strengthened etc&#8230; I hope we will not end up loses because of the incertitude originates from election and politics discussions. The realm of the state cannot afford the games of “pretends”&#8230; &copy; 2005 Dogan Daily News Inc.

Last month, 102 U.S. service members were killed in action, making April and May the deadliest two-month period for the American military since the March 2003 invasion. The highest number of deaths in a single month was 135 service members killed in action in November 2004, when Marines fought the battle for Fallujah. Four U.S. soldiers were killed in two separate roadside bomb attacks yesterday. A soldier seriously wounded in a May 28 roadside bomb attack died of his wounds a day later. A sixth soldier died from a non-combat related cause on May 29. The military detailed the deaths in separate e-mailed statements yesterday and today. U.S. deaths in Iraq have risen each month since intensified efforts to secure Baghdad and the western province of al-Anbar began in February. President George W. Bush ordered the deployment of the additional forces in January. At least 436 U.S. personnel have been wounded so seriously this month that they couldn&#39;t return to duty. Eight soldiers and an Iraqi child were hurt in a suicide bomb attack on a military checkpoint in Baghdad yesterday, the military said in a separate statement. ``It&#39;s been a tough month,&#39;&#39; Brigadier-General Perry Wiggins, deputy director for regional operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a televised Pentagon briefing yesterday. The fifth and final brigade of the roughly 30,000 additional U.S. forces deployed as part of the so-called ``surge&#39;&#39; has arrived in Iraq and will be operational by mid-June, Wiggins said. There has been an ``increase in fights with terrorists and extremists of all affiliations&#39;&#39; since the deployment of additional forces, U.S. military spokesman Major General William Caldwell said on May 23. ``We now have more troops conducting more operations involving more troops resulting in more confrontations,&#39;&#39; Caldwell said. Some 3,459 U.S. personnel had died in Iraq, of whom 2,834 were killed in action, as of 10 a.m. New York time yesterday. More than 25,000 had been wounded, 11,526 of them so seriously that they couldn&#39;t return to duty, according to the Department of Defense Web site. Pentagon figures showed that since the 3,342 U.S. deaths recorded in Iraq by the end of April, a further 117 service members had died this month, prior to the latest casualties.

The latest in a series of essays by the 80-year-old Castro, who has not been seen in public since becoming ill more than 10 months ago, was published on the front page of the Communist Party daily Granma. The Cuban leader said that Bush, asked recently about his Cuba policy, replied: "I'm a hard-line president and I'm only waiting for Castro to die." "I'm not the first, nor will I be the last, who Bush has ordered to be deprived of life," said Castro, who offered no details of the alleged conversation. American law now prohibits the U.S. government from ordering the assassination of foreign leaders, but declassified U.S. documents show that the CIA made numerous attempts to kill Castro in the early years after the 1959 Cuban revolution. "Ideas are not killed," Castro wrote. He criticized the Bush administration for spending on weaponry while people in developing nations go hungry. "I ask myself how many doctors can graduate with the 100 billion dollars that in just one year fall into Bush's hands to continue to sow mourning in Iraqi and American homes," he wrote. "The answer: 999,990 doctors, who could attend to 2 billion people who today receive no medical care." Castro shocked Cuba on July 31 when he announced that he had undergone emergency intestinal surgery and was stepping aside provisionally for his younger brother Raul, the defense minister, during his recovery. Although senior Cuban officials have said Castro is on the mend, it seems more unlikely with time that the bearded leader will return to power. In one of his essays this month, Castro offered a few new details about illness, saying that he had numerous operations and that the first procedure did not go well. Castro's exact ailment and condition remain state secrets, but he is widely believed to suffer from diverticular disease, which causes sacs in the colon that can become inflamed and bleed. .

By Kelly Yamanouchi Denver Post Staff Writer Article Last Updated: 05/30/2007 09:29:46 PM MDT A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union contends that a unit of Arapahoe County-based Jeppesen Sanderson Inc. provided flight support for the Central Intelligence Agency to transport suspected terrorists to facilities where they were tortured. Jeppesen, through its International Trip Planning Services, provides support such as itinerary planning, route planning and ground handling to businesses and government agencies. The ACLU filed the suit in San Jose, Calif., against Jeppesen's Dataplan unit, which does international trip planning and has U.S. operations in San Jose. The lawsuit says Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret "extraordinary rendition" flights over four years to countries "where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused" against legal standards. "Extraordinary rendition should be condemned. It should not be seen as a source of corporate profit," said ACLU executive director Anthony Romero. The suit cites an article from The New Yorker magazine that quotes an anonymous former Jeppesen employee recounting that Bob Overby, managing director of Jeppesen International Trip Planning, said during an internal corporate meeting, "We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights - you know, the torture flights. Let's face it, some of those flights end up that way." Jeppesen spokesman Mike Pound called the reported Overby comment "a third-hand report of something that somebody said - in other words, it's hearsay." "We really don't know much of anything about a trip of that nature," Pound said. "We don't need to know why a customer is taking a trip, and we don't ask." CIA spokesman George Little said in an e-mailed comment that the United States "does not conduct or condone torture, nor does it transport anyone to other countries for the purpose of torture. The goal of renditions is to get terrorists off the streets in a way that complies with our laws and treaty obligations." "Renditions have occurred far less frequently than some press reports suggest, and they are subject to careful review," Little said. Some U.S. corporations, the ACLU lawsuit says, "have furnished aircraft and personnel to transport persons identified by the United States as potential terrorist threats to detention and interrogation facilities overseas. Other corporations, including Jeppesen, have provided flight and logistical support services to these aircraft and crew." An ACLU official said he believes many other companies are involved and that he hopes they "take note." The ACLU filed the suit on behalf of foreign nationals Binyam Mohamed, Abou Elkassim Britel and Ahmed Agiza, who the suit says were flown overseas and tortured. It also petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review a suit that claims former CIA Director George Tenet violated U.S. and universal human-rights laws by authorizing agents to detain Khaled El-Masri. The suit was dismissed by a lower court after the government invoked "state secrets" privilege. "The government is the one that is liable," said Ved Nanda, a professor of international law at the University of Denver. "I think it will be very hard for the ACLU to win the case (against Jeppesen). But what it will do is bring the issue before the public, create awareness ... and so in that sense it serves the purpose." The suit cites customary international law and says Jeppesen should be punished by an award of punitive damages to be determined at trial. It also asks for compensatory damages of more than $75,000. The suit names Premier Executive Transportation Services and Aero Contractors Limited as owners and operators of aircraft that were flown to Morocco, Pakistan and other locations. "This puts other companies on notice, that they are likely to be blackballed and there are going to be people who probably think about them as also responsible for this kind of heinous act," Nanda said. A group called South Bay Mobilization has asked people to come to events in past months at Jeppesen's San Jose location and at a San Jose skating rink, urging them to "Join Us to Skate Against Torture" and "Abolish the Torture Flights," according to its website. Mark Loewenstein, a law professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said corporations must take into consideration potential liability. "The question is: Have they violated the law, did they knowingly violate the law, and do they have some kind of immunity (because it is work for the government)?" Loewenstein said.

A U.S. military helicopter hit a house and car at early Thursday killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home a police officer said. A U.S. military statement, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" on Thursday in Sadr City. BAGHDAD- A suicide bomber hit a police recruiting center Thursday in Fallujah, killing as many as 25 people, police said. The U.S. military said only one policeman was killed and eight were wounded. U.S. forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al-Qaida gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. The American military also reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed Wednesday in a roadside bombing in Baghdad and one who died of wounds from a roadside bomb attack northwest of the capital Tuesday. At least 122 American forces have died in May, the third-deadliest month of the Iraq conflict. U.S. forces also continued a search for five Britons who were kidnapped Tuesday in Baghdad, as well as for two of its soldiers who have been missing since a May 12 ambush south of the capital. The Fallujah suicide bomber killed at least 10 policemen in the attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. The rest of the dead were civilians, many of them in line seeking jobs as policemen. He said as many as 50 were wounded. Fallujah General Hospital had received 15 bodies and 10 wounded, according to a doctor there, who would not allow the use of his name because he feared retribution. The physician said he believed other casualties were taken to the nearby Jordanian Hospital and private clinics. A member of the Fallujah city council, who also asked for anonymity for fear of attack by insurgents, said there were at least 20 killed and 25 injured. The coordination of information in Fallujah was particularly difficult because the mobile telephone system has been working only sporadically. Maj. Jeff Pool of the Multi-National Force-West said the Anbar province governor's office and the provincial police put the total number of dead at one Iraqi policeman, with six police and two civilians wounded in Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated explosives in his vest at the third of four checkpoints, standing among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only opened Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The U.S. military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaida. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of Sunni insurgents and al-Qaida throughout the war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents called for U.S. help. Members of al-Qaida, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final exams, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from al-Qaida. Clashes continued into the afternoon, and the council official said the al-Qaida leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the U.S. military. U.S. forces, meanwhile, pressed on with the search for five kidnapped Britons, and a procession of mourners, some of them women wailing and beating their chests, marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a U.S. helicopter strike before dawn. The U.S. military said it had no report of airstrikes in Sadr City and that there were no civilian casualties in the second day of a search for the Britons, who were abducted Tuesday from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad. A U.S. military statement, however, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. AP Television News videotape from Sadr City showed the coffins of the victims atop a small bus with men and women walking behind, crying. A young boy could be seen sitting next to the coffins. A car in the area was punctured with big holes, as if hit by an airstrike. A police officer in Sadr City, who refused to allow use of his name because he feared retribution, said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 a.m., killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home&mdash;a common practice in Iraq's extreme heat through late spring and summer. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was wounded. Also in Sadr City raids, which the U.S. has been conducting with a select unit of Iraqi army forces, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi claimed his home was raided and ransacked by American forces at 3 a.m. Thursday. The military said it had no report of the incident. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. Dozens of U.S. Humvees and Bradley fighting vehicles had taken up positions around Sadr City at nightfall Wednesday. The five kidnapped Britons included four bodyguards working for the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld and one employee of BearingPoint, a U.S.-based management consulting firm. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. The Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, claimed responsibility. Wiggins also said that more than 100 patrols a day were being launched to search for two missing troops who vanished after a May 12 ambush near Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. Four Americans and one Iraqi soldier were killed in the attack and the body of another American was later found in the Euphrates River. "Our determination and resolve to locate our missing soldiers is unwavering," Wiggins said. The Mercury News is pleased to let readers post comments about an article at the end of the article.

(AP) -- Colorado State University hurricane researcher William Gray&#39;s revised forecast issued today calls for nine hurricanes this season, five of them becoming intense. The forecast calls for a very active season, with 17 named storms in the Atlantic basin between June 1 and Nov. 30 and a 74 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the U.S. coastline. Phil Klotzbach, lead author of the forecast, said the team expects an above-average hurricane season. The revised forecast is virtually identical to the prediction Gray&#39;s team issued in April. It calls for the same number of named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes. It also says there&#39;s a 50 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the East Coast, including the Florida Peninsula. The long-term average is 31 percent.

The Saturday Early Show CBS News Sunday Morning Up To The Minute Couric & Co. Home E-mail Couric & Co. Couric & Co. RSS Feed CBS News RSS Feeds Fidel Castro: Communist Columnist is a CBS News producer based in Havana, Cuba Cuban President Fidel Castro could have a career as a syndicated columnist. Despite his renown as a lengthy speechmaker, the convalescing leader is turning out short and to-the-point editorials on a nearly daily basis in recent weeks. His comments Tuesday evening focus on the upcoming G8 meeting in Germany. Once again he takes U.S. President George Bush to task, this time on the need to protect the environment and stop climate change. He quotes the German Minister of the Environment as telling the AFP news agency it will be “very difficult” for the G8 summit to successfully confront global warming due to U.S. opposition. Castro also takes a swipe at British Prime Minister Tony Blair for saying “he will persuade his friend George” on these issues. “The only sure thing,” writes Castro, "is that [Blair] is adding another submarine to the three currently being built in Great Britain, which brings the spending on sophisticated weapons up by another $2.5 billion.” In a previous editorial Castro said Cuba could train 75,000 doctors or build 3,000 sophisticated medical clinics in poor countries for the amount the four nuclear-powered attack submarines are costing Britain. Today Castro quips, “perhaps someone with one of Bill Gates' new computer programs could keep track of the resources for health, education and culture that this military spending denies humanity.” President Bush, who Castro refers to by his first name alone, “had better decide what he really thinks in the G8 meeting” on the dangers facing peace and the world’s food supply. “Someone should ask him about it,” writes the Cuban leader, concluding, “he should not try to get off with the advice of his friend Blair.” As has been their practice since President Castro began writing these pieces, the Cuban government sent an advance copy of the commentary dated 6:45 p.m. local time Tuesday, to the foreign press. Practically all of the commentaries he has written have been signed and dated at the end of what would be the regular work day for most people, between 5 and 8 p.m. Observers say that the regularity of his output and their timing suggests that for the first time in his life, Castro is following a normal schedule. If he is reading, writing and undergoing physical rehabilitation during the day and sleeping at night as they suggest, it represents a complete break with his previous pattern of working around the clock and only catching a few hours sleep mid-morning. The 80-year-old Castro has undergone, according to his own account, several operations to stem intestinal bleeding since the end of last July. The exact nature of the illness that has kept him out of the public eye is still unknown although he is widely believed to have suffered from diverticulitis with inflammation and bleeding of the colon. His condition obliged him to step down, “temporarily” handing power over to his younger brother Defense Minister Raul Castro ten months ago. 12:29 PM : May 30, 2007 Read more posts in Now you're in the public comment zone.

The Taliban said 35 people died in the helicopter crash in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan. Hours after the helicopter went down, the Taliban ambushed a police convoy on a main road in southern Zabul province and killed 16 policemen, the interior ministry said. Since the traditional winter lull, the resurgent Taliban have stepped up actions in recent months with a series of suicide attacks, roadside bombs and ambushes against foreign and Afghan forces. In an apparent response to the Chinook crash, a joint NATO and Afghan raid supported by air power killed and wounded dozens of Taliban in Sangin district, close to Kajaki where the twin-rotor NATO helicopter went down on Wednesday night, the Afghan defense ministry said. NATO said the fighting was part of a broader offensive called "Operation Lastay Kulang," from the local Pashto language for "axe handle," meant to extend the Afghan government's control into the north of Helmand province. Officials said 2,000 foreign and Afghan troops, including 1,000 British soldiers and elements of the elite U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, were involved in a push to loosen the Taliban's grip on the Sangin Valley. Helmand, a long-time bastion of the Taliban, is the leading drug-producing region of Afghanistan, the world's main heroin supplier. It has been the scene of a series of bloody fights between Taliban and Western forces in recent months. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

The letter, given last night to Lieutenant General Sutiyoso, blames a communication breakdown for the visit by Detective Sergeant Steve Thomas and a fellow officer. The letter also promises an investigation into why "security and protocol was less than satisfactory". "I apologise for the distress and inconvenience caused and regret your early departure from NSW," Mr Iemma says. Despite his earlier outrage, Governor Sutiyoso - who cut short his trip to Australia on Tuesday in apparent protest at the intrusion - last night accepted Mr Iemma's apology. The diplomatic incident was sparked after Sergeant Thomas was asked to deliver a request from the NSW Coroner for Governor Sutiyoso to attend an inquest into the death of one of five Australian-based journalists killed in Balibo, East Timor, in 1975, allegedly at the hands of a commando squad of which the Governor was a member. The easing of tensions came after Australian ambassador Bill Farmer visited Mr Sutiyoso at his City Hall offices for the second time yesterday to pass on the letter of apology having earlier conveyed his regrets. "I feel very touched with this letter, very satisfied," the Governor said. "There are so many apologies in it, in so many ways, that I must be big-hearted. I must thaw this row between Jakarta and NSW. A letter like this is almost too much - more than I need." An interim report on the incident was delivered to NSW Police Minister David Campbell yesterday and will now be included in a wider inquiry conducted by Mr Iemma's office. General Sutiyoso's chief of staff, Suhendro Baskito, yesterday said his boss was undressed when the police entered his room. "He was asleep, the two police woke him up. They were standing at the side of his bed. "He asked 'Who are you?' and they explained that they were police officers and wanted him to appear at the inquiry into the East Timor killings. "He immediately called me. I was staying in the adjoining room. By the time I got there he was wearing shorts and a T-shirt." A spokeswoman for the Shangri-La Hotel yesterday repeated claims that police had demanded access to the room, which was provided by the duty manager, using a master key.

Andrei Lugovoy, the man Britain wants to put on trial for Litvinenko's poisoning, said he believes British secret services and Boris Berezovsky, a wealthy Kremlin opponent now living in Britain, were involved in Litvinenko's murder. "Andrei Lugovoy's statement is, in essence, a Kremlin statement," Berezovsky, a multi-millionaire businessman who was a pall bearer at Litvinenko's funeral, told Ekho Moskvy radio station in a telephone interview. "This statement makes everything clear, it has become obvious that the whole campaign the Kremlin is staging around Litvinenko's murder is a campaign of state lies."

http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/67520.html&cid Indonesia demands apology from Australia as relations fray yet again Indonesia demands apology from Australia as relations fray yet again Wed, 30 May 2007 06:02:00GMT Australasia World News | Jakarta - The governor of Jakarta on Wednesday demanded an explanation and apology from Australia after he was issued an invitation to testify at an inquest into the 1975 deaths of five Australian journalists in East Timor. Sutiyoso, a former army general, cut short his trip to Australia and returned home Tuesday after being served the voluntary summons earlier that day at his Sydney hotel by two policemen who he said barged into his room. "Through the [Indonesian] Foreign Ministry, I ask that the Australian government explain what happened," he told reporters in Jakarta, according to the state-run Antara news agency. Sutiyoso, a potential Indonesian presidential candidate, also threatened to review Jakarta's sister city cultural agreement with Australia's New South Wales province, whose coroner is conducting the inquest. The incident has once again raised tensions in Indonesian-Australian relations. The countries have quarrelled in recent years over Australia's military assistance to East Timor when it broke away from Indonesia, human-rights issues, terrorism, Iraq and the conviction of several young Australians on drug charges on Bali. "We call on the government to send a protest to the Australian government over the incident," said Lukman Hakim Syaifuddin, a member of Indonesia's parliament from the United Development Party. The inquest, being held in Sydney, has heard evidence that the five journalists didn't die in crossfire in the town of Balibo, as Indonesia maintains, but were deliberately killed by Indonesian troops. Mark Tedeschi, counsel assisting the coroner, told the Coroner's Court that the "journalists were not killed by being caught in crossfire ... but rather were deliberately killed by the Indonesian troops who had arrived at the Balibo town square." Tedeschi said the journalists were trying to surrender to troops headed by Captain Mohammad Yunus Yosfiah, who went on to be Indonesia's information minister. "At least three of the journalists were shot by Indonesian troops after an order was given by Captain Yunus Yosfiah, ... who also joined in the shooting of those three," Tedeschi charged. He argued the journalists died because Jakarta wanted to cover up preparations for its invasion of East Timor a few months later. East Timor achieved independence in 2002. Sutiyoso, a retired general, was a member of a special operations team that entered Balibo in 1975 although he denies being there himself. The inquest by the New South Wales coroner followed lobbying by a wife of one of the reporters for it to be held and inconclusive Australian parliamentary inquiries. Indonesian soldiers have also been accused of killing a Dutch journalist in East Timor in 1999 after the province voted for independence in a United Nations-run referendum.

Turkey last carried out a major incursion into Iraq a decade ago, before the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. But separatist Kurdish guerrillas, taking advantage of power vacuum in northern Iraq, have escalated attacks on Turkish targets. Turkey complains the United States and Iraqi Kurds have done little to stop them. "As soldiers, we are ready," Gen. Yasar Buyukanit said Thursday, adding that the military was awaiting government orders before planning the offensive. The military needs parliamentary approval for the deployment. Public support for such an operation has increased after recent killings of soldiers and a suicide bombing that killed six people and which authorities blamed on the rebels. Many Turks &#8212; complaining of a lack of help from the U.S. and other allies &#8212; believe a major incursion would help finish off the rebels from the Kurdistan Worker&#039;s Party, or PKK, which has been fighting for autonomy of the Kurdish-dominated southeast since 1984, a conflict that has killed tens of thousands. Russian denies involvement in Litvinenko killing Bicycle programs catching on in major cities Europe leads in designing buildings that save energy Although the Turkish government promised to back the military, it has been slow in asking Parliament for approval to deploy troops, anticipating problems with Washington, Iraq and the European Union &#8212; all of which have urged Turkey to show restraint and find nonmilitary ways to deal with the Kurdish rebellion. Turkey&#039;s human rights records has been stained by allegations of excessive use of force in the fight against the guerrillas. And an incursion would also likely pit two U.S. allies &#8212; Iraqi Kurds and the Turkish military &#8212; against one another. Turkish intelligence reports say that Iraqi Kurdish groups, which previously supported the Turkish military in fighting the guerrillas, were preparing defenses against a possible Turkish incursion into northern Iraq. Ankara fears that Iraqi Kurds want to establish an independent Kurdish state, which could revive the aspirations of separatist Kurds in Turkey. The Turkish military also said it opposed Kurdish plans to seize oil-rich Kirkuk, and vowed to protect Turkmens living in the city. The United States opposes any unilateral Turkish military action, fearing it could destabilize northern Iraq &#8212; the most stable part of the war-torn country. Washington also fears that, if it supports Turkey, it could alienate the pro-American Iraqi Kurds. On Thursday, military trucks hauled more tanks and guns to the border area, local reporters said. The deployment has made it more difficult for the rebels to retreat to bases in northern Iraq, the military said. But U.S. State Department said Wednesday it had seen no evidence of a significant movement of Turkish military forces in the border. Meanwhile, Buyukanit also complained about what he said was a lack of help from allies. "Turkey does not receive the necessary support in its fight against terrorism," he said at an international security conference in Istanbul. "There are countries which directly or indirectly support PKK terrorism." Past cross-border operations have yielded mixed results, with many guerrillas sheltering in hide-outs and emerging again after most Turkish units withdrew. A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, said the military could set up a buffer zone in northern Iraq to block Kurdish rebels from entering Turkey. Turkey had set up a buffer zone along the 200-mile (330-kilometer) border in 1997, but gradually withdrew the bulk of its troops under international pressure, leaving about 1,000 inside Iraq. Those troops act as monitors, but have not pursued the rebels. "To set up a buffer zone, Turkey needs to secure the consent of both Washington and the Iraqi Kurds," said Nihat Ali Ozcan of the Economic Policy Research Institute in Ankara. "However, the military buildup clearly puts more pressure on U.S. and Iraqi forces to do something quickly." The Turkish military says up to 3,800 rebels are now based in Iraq, and up to 2,300 operate inside Turkey. Turkish troops, reinforced by planes and helicopter gunships, have killed 14 PKK guerrillas in operations near the border since Monday. On Thursday, suspected PKK rebels opened fire on a group of forest workers cutting down trees in the province of Bingol, killing one of them and injuring seven others, local officials said.

Days after extradition papers were served by UK authorities, Andrei Lugovoi said British secret services were involved in his former friend's murder. Worsening relations: Putin and Blair Litvinenko died in a London hospital in November after his tea was poisoned with rare radioactive isotope polonium-210. Mr Lugovoi says the British secret services were involved in his murder - and that his former friend had been working for MI6. Sky News Russia Correspondent Alex Rossi said the claims would intensify the already frosty relations between Britain and Russia. President Vladimir Putin's government has already made clear it has no intention of extraditing Mr Lugovoi. Referring to Mr Lugovoi's press conference, Rossi said: "The language fitted Soviet times rather than the 21st century. "He claimed Alexander Litvinenko had become too much of a nuisance for MI6 and effectively they got rid of him with polonium-210. "He's countering the allegations made against him and the circumstantial evidence of the polonium trail that followed him from Moscow to Britain. "And he's saying that it's not just Russia that has access to polonium-210, but that the poison would have the mark of a Soviet-style assassination and the blame would be batted back to the Kremlin." Mr Lugovoi claimed he had evidence that the British secret services were aware of what was happening even if they did not commit the murder themselves. Rossi added: "There may be a lot of people out there who think this is rubbish but there may also be people who think this has the ring of truth in it. "The key thing is that there are only a few people London who know whether this is true, and only a few people in Moscow who know whether this is true, and all of those people are either not with us any more or in jobs where they are not going to talk about it. "But it certainly ramps up the war of words between London and Moscow." This month Tony Blair himself criticised Russia, drawing attention to Vladimir Putin's energy policy, and saying he had concerns about human rights in Russia. Mr Putin, meanwhile, publicly criticised the UK ambassador to Russia for attending a conference organised by the opposition.

Drozdiak: Climate Change Seen as Major G8 Issue William Drozdiak, a longtime expert on transatlantic politics, says a major issue at the annual G8 meeting that begins on June 6 will be European efforts to persuade the United States to adopt limits on greenhouse gas emissions. He says that German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who will chair the meeting, believes a U.S. commitment on some limits is important to counter the &#8220;rising tide of anti-Americanism and distress with American policy in many parts of the world.&#8221; The annual G8 meeting will take place starting June 6 in Germany. You&#8217;ve been a longtime observer of these meetings. What do you expect this year? At the top of the list is the question of climate change. In the last couple of years, this has been one of the big issues at these G8 meetings [G8 refers to the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia]. In particular, Tony Blair, Britain&#8217;s Prime Minister, has made it a top priority. Japan has also made it a top priority, and now we see Chancellor [Angela] Merkel, who before becoming chancellor had been an environment minister, doing the same She wants to get the United States back in the game on acting in climate change. In fact, she&#8217;s going to have a private lunch ahead of the meeting with President Bush next Wednesday just before the group convenes. She will try to push him into greater cooperation on climate change. The broader theme she is stressing here is that there is a rising tide of anti-Americanism and distress with American policy in many parts of the world. She holds that not only is there widespread opposition to Iraq, but that many in the world have the perception that the United States places itself above international law. She feels the best way for the United States to gain some degree of moral leadership is to seize the initiative and act on this whole issue of global warming. That will be a very strong message from her. And this is to set new limits? Right, the Germans want a specific benchmark. They want to get all of the parties to commit to limiting the rise of worldwide temperatures to two degrees Celsius, which is 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and reducing global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The moral argument is that the United States accounts for 3 percent of the world&#8217;s population and produces 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. So, Merkel argues, we Americans really have a moral obligation to take the lead on this. I take it that India and China are not terribly interested in this? No. India, which has been invited to the summit next week, has already said it would reject these proposals because it fears that it would slow down its booming economy. And the American objections are the same: It&#8217;s too high a cost to the economy? Yes, and that it unfairly penalizes the United States. The United States argues that the most important thing to do is to bring China and India in. China, they claim, will soon surpass the United States as the world&#8217;s biggest polluter. So we need to bring these fast growing developing countries into the There&#8217;s been considerable strain in both U.S. and EU relations with Russia lately. Do you think anything can really be accomplished on that subject? This is again an important theme that will be playing out in the months to come. It was just announced that President Vladimir Putin will visit Bush at the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine [in early July]. The number one issue next week will be what to do about Kosovo, the southern Serbian province, which is heavily populated with Albanians. The UN envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, has proposed a slow-motion movement towards independence, but the Russians sided with the Serbs and have objected to any international change in sovereignty here. This all plays out against the background of growing distrust with what is going on in Putin&#8217;s Russia: the fear that Russia is backsliding away from democracy and that it is becoming once more a very assertive and possibly a belligerent neighbor for European countries. This places Germany, in particular, in a difficult position. While Britain and the United States have attacked Russia quite strongly about the risks of backing away from democratic reforms, the Germans say, &#8220;Look, we need Russia to play a cooperative role on several issues, whether it be on energy supplies&#8212;because Germany is Europe&#8217;s largest importer of Russian oil and gas (which covers about 40 percent of Germany&#8217;s energy needs)&#8212;and also on Kosovo; and the question on future sanctions in Iran; and also Darfur, where President Bush has asked for sanctions and both Russia and China object.&#8221; And of course the Russians are very upset about Poland. They have a ban on Polish meat which affects EU trade with Russia. Yes, and there are several other issues. There was a flap about a war memorial in Estonia that was taken down. You mentioned the Polish meat exports, and with Lithuania there&#8217;s been a fight over energy supplies. At least for the Europeans, Russia is emerging as one of the biggest foreign-policy headaches. They need to come up with a much more unified position. Of course Russia is crucial to get additional Security Council sanctions on Iran over the nuclear enrichment issues. In addition, the United States wants to deploy radar and interceptor missiles in the Czech Republic and Poland to thwart the threat of missiles being launched from Iran. They claim this will not have any effect on Russia, but the Russians say they don&#8217;t believe that. On traditional issues like the Middle East, I guess everything is so up in the air that not very much can be accomplished. Since the ministers [this week] from the United States, the European Union, and Russia will be in Potsdam, they&#8217;ll take a train to Berlin to discuss the future of the so-called &#8220;Road Map&#8221; for negotiations between Israel and Palestinians. I doubt they&#8217;ll take any dramatic steps because they&#8217;ll be waiting for a meeting between Prime Minister [Ehud] Olmert and the Palestinian Authority leader, Mahmoud Abbas, in a week or so. And on Iran, they also will await the outcome of a meeting between Ali Larijani, Iran&#8217;s negotiator on nuclear issues, and Javier Solana, the EU foreign minister. And if procedure follows precedent, they&#8217;ll have canned statements they&#8217;ll issue at the conference on these different subjects? Yes, they&#8217;ll come out with a whole sheaf of declarations, and whatever differences there are, they&#8217;ll try to mask them with some fuzzy language. But the atmosphere is slightly improved by the resolution of the flap over Paul Wolfowitz, who in effect was forced to resign as president of the World Bank. Europeans are very pleased with the announcement that Robert Zoellick will take over the presidency of the World Bank. They all know him from his days as a That&#8217;s right. He&#8217;s respected throughout Africa and other developing countries from his work as a trade negotiator. The Germans, in particular, are pleased with him. They have a lot of admiration for him dating back to his role in helping negotiate the peaceful reunification of Germany when he was an aide to former Secretary of State James Baker. I gather this will be an extraordinary outpouring of protests opposing globalization. These protests occur every time there&#8217;s a G8 meeting, right? Yes. This has really developed over the years, and it has turned pretty ugly, and in some cases, violent. I remember attending one conference in Genoa during which a protestor was killed, and this set off all sorts of angry and violent demonstrations. But the German fear is that the site where the summit will take place [Heiligendamm, a Baltic Sea resort] is fairly insecure in that it is very flat and easily accessible from different places. They probably regret deciding to hold it there, but it was done for political reasons because it&#8217;s basically the home base of Chancellor Merkel. What are these people most opposed to? Free trade? In some cases it&#8217;s the loss of jobs; in other cases, especially in poor countries, it&#8217;s the concern that their interests are not being taken care of in world trade negotiations. Most of all, it&#8217;s the belief&#8212;however wrongheaded it may be&#8212;that there is this small directorate of countries getting together to decide global policies and that others will have to deal with it. There has been a lot of debate in recent years about whether the G8 really accurately reflects the global economy of the day. There&#8217;s talk about inviting China, India, and Brazil along with [newest member] Russia into the G8 to expand it into an organization that looks more and more like the interests of the global economy. But right now, that has been blocked just as reform of the UN Security Council has been blocked. India will only be there to talk about global warming? India will be there and they will be part of the discussion on climate change. India will try to make the case that whatever problems there are with greenhouse gases, they were created by the developed world in their rush towards industrialization. They&#8217;ll argue it&#8217;s unfair to penalize the development of poor countries, particularly those with large populations like China and India with one billion plus people, from achieving greater prosperity. On climate change, it&#8217;s interesting how the Bush administration has been opposed to this since it took office. It wouldn&#8217;t agree to the Kyoto treaty, but the Senate didn&#8217;t support it either, right? Right, and there was a vote of something like ninety-seven to nothing opposed to the Kyoto treaty. There is widespread disagreement about this. However, it has gained greater attention in the United States now, partly because of the Al Gore movie [ ], and the growing recognition that climate change is a real threat that the United States has to do something about. The Democrats have woken up to this earlier than the Republicans. In fact, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, was in Berlin for the last couple of days meeting with German officials, including Chancellor Merkel. She acknowledged that the United States needs to show much greater leadership in trying to curb the threat of global warming. And the early indication is what? Right now, they&#8217;re still negotiating on the text, and the United States has expressed great displeasure with the declaration the way the Germans have drawn it up. They say while they&#8217;re not opposed to setting goals, they want the emphasis to be placed on reducing dependence on gasoline and greater energy efficiency rather than on measuring significant reductions in the production of greenhouse gases.

Andrei Lugovoi, the man charged by the UK with murdering the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, today claimed British intelligence had been involved in his death. Speaking at an extraordinary press conference in Moscow, he said UK security services had in the past tried to recruit him, and that Litvinenko was working for MI6. Mr Lugovoi claimed the British were trying to make him a scapegoat for the dissident's death by turning him into a "Russian James Bond". When the Guardian asked Mr Lugovoi whether he had any proof for his allegations that the British government was, in effect, responsible for Litvinenko's death, he replied: "I do." Litvinenko was poisoned by the radioactive isotope polonium-210, dying in a London hospital on November 23 last year. Mr Lugovoi said Britain was trying to recruit Russian citizens as spies to find compromising material on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The UK had sought "compromising information" on Mr Putin from him during business trips in previous years, he claimed, adding: "They are selling British citizenship ... it is sold in the same way that Chinese shirts are sold in the market." The former KGB bodyguard, now a wealthy businessman, accused Britain of being naive and careless in embracing Russian exiles such as Boris Berezovsky. He claimed to have three possible explanations for the death of Litvinenko, and alleged that both Litvinenko and Mr Berezovsky were MI6 agents. Litvinenko, he said, told him that the British, including MI6, were "complete idiots" who would believe anything you told them. Mr Lugovoi did not give a precise date for when he said UK intelligence had attempted to recruit him, but indicated that the alleged approach had happened in late 2005 or early 2006. The Foreign Office declined to comment on his claims. Last week, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to charge Mr Lugovoi with the murder of Litvinenko, an ex-KGB agent turned Kremlin critic. Mr Lugovoi today rubbished the British version of events, saying: "They're trying to portray me as a Russian James Bond who jump inside a nuclear reactor and poisons his Russian friend and children and wife - all done by one individual [Lugovoi]. What is the motive?" He met Litvinenko at a London hotel before the dissident become unwell, and was also contaminated with polonium-210, along with friend and business partner Dmitri Kovtun. Police found traces of polonium on Mr Lugovoi's wife and children. When a reporter asked him today who had killed Litvinenko, he said: "It is the matter of the prosecutors. I don't know who killed him." He added that "Litvinenko was not my enemy", saying he planned to hire lawyers in London and would "fight to clear my name". Mr Lugovoi said the CPS decision meant he would not be able to go to the UK to explain his case, and claimed he had previously been prepared to fly to Britain with his lawyers to speak to police at Scotland Yard. Earlier this week, the British ambassador to Moscow delivered a request for his extradition. Russian officials said the country's laws did not permit such an extradition, but also appeared to suggest Moscow could extradite Mr Lugovoi to the UK in exchange for Mr Berezovsky, an outspoken enemy of Mr Putin. British security and intelligence officials believe that former and possibly serving agents of the Russian state were behind Litvinenko's murder, arguing that only a state institution could produce polonium-210. &#169; Copyright Guardian Newspapers 2006 Use the feedback form below to submit your comments.

The U.S. military said only one policeman was killed and eight were wounded. U.S. forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al-Qaida gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. The American military also reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed Wednesday in a roadside bombing in Baghdad and one who died of wounds from a roadside bomb attack northwest of the capital Tuesday. At least 122 American forces have died in May, the third-deadliest month of the Iraq conflict. U.S. forces also continued a search for five Britons who were kidnapped Tuesday in Baghdad, as well as for two of its soldiers who have been missing since a May 12 ambush south of the capital. The Fallujah suicide bomber killed at least 10 policemen in the attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. The rest of the dead were civilians, many of them in line seeking jobs as policemen. He said as many as 50 were wounded. Fallujah General Hospital had received 15 bodies and 10 wounded, according to a doctor there, who would not allow the use of his name because he feared retribution. The physician said he believed other casualties were taken to the nearby Jordanian Hospital and private clinics. A member of the Fallujah city council, who also asked for anonymity for fear of attack by insurgents, said there were at least 20 killed and 25 injured. The coordination of information in Fallujah was particularly difficult because the mobile telephone system has been working only sporadically. Maj. Jeff Pool of the Multi-National Force-West said the Anbar province governor's office and the provincial police put the total number of dead at one Iraqi policeman, with six police and two civilians wounded in Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated explosives in his vest at the third of four checkpoints, standing among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only opened Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The U.S. military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaida. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of Sunni insurgents and al-Qaida throughout the war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents called for U.S. help. Members of al-Qaida, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final exams, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from al-Qaida. Clashes continued into the afternoon, and the council official said the al-Qaida leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the U.S. military. U.S. forces, meanwhile, pressed on with the search for five kidnapped Britons, and a procession of mourners, some of them women wailing and beating their chests, marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a U.S. helicopter strike before dawn. The U.S. military said it had no report of airstrikes in Sadr City and that there were no civilian casualties in the second day of a search for the Britons, who were abducted Tuesday from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad. A U.S. military statement, however, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. AP Television News videotape from Sadr City showed the coffins of the victims atop a small bus with men and women walking behind, crying. A young boy could be seen sitting next to the coffins. A car in the area was punctured with big holes, as if hit by an airstrike. A police officer in Sadr City, who refused to allow use of his name because he feared retribution, said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 a.m., killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home &mdash; a common practice in Iraq's extreme heat through late spring and summer. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was wounded. Also in Sadr City raids, which the U.S. has been conducting with a select unit of Iraqi army forces, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi claimed his home was raided and ransacked by American forces at 3 a.m. Thursday. The military said it had no report of the incident. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. Dozens of U.S. Humvees and Bradley fighting vehicles had taken up positions around Sadr City at nightfall Wednesday. The five kidnapped Britons included four bodyguards working for the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld and one employee of BearingPoint, a U.S.-based management consulting firm. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. The Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, claimed responsibility. Wiggins also said that more than 100 patrols a day were being launched to search for two missing troops who vanished after a May 12 ambush near Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. Four Americans and one Iraqi soldier were killed in the attack and the body of another American was later found in the Euphrates River. "Our determination and resolve to locate our missing soldiers is unwavering," Wiggins said.

Lee: trip to Japan is to have cultural exchanges Former President Lee Teng-hui is stressing the cultural and academic nature of his current visit to Japan. The comments appeared to be aimed at quelling concern in China that his visit would be political in nature. But Lee said Wednesday that he did not schedule any meetings with Japanese politicians. Lee also spoke on Thursday about a planned trip to visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine - a shrine which critics say is a memorial to Japan's militarist past. "My elder brother has been enshrined there for 60 years. I am his younger brother. Sixty years ago, he took a picture when he was conscripted and was about to leave for the Philippines. I have not seen that picture since then. It makes me cry when I think of it," said Lee.

Iran also refused to budge ahead of talks Thursday between Iran's chief international negotiator and the European Union's senior foreign policy official.

VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article Asked if it is time to change tactics in the world's nuclear standoff with Iran, Rice ruled out the idea of dropping a key precondition. "I think it's time for Iran to change its tactics," Rice said. There is increasing sentiment in Europe that world powers trying to engage Iran should drop the demand that Iran halt, or suspend in diplomatic parlance, disputed nuclear activities before bargaining on a package of incentives could begin. "The international community is united on what Iran should do, which is to suspend; to demonstrate that it is in fact not seeking a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power," Rice said. She spoke during a press conference with Austria's foreign minister, a year to the day after she made a dramatic outreach to longtime adversary Iran. The offer to talk "anytime, any place," was intended to inject new life into an ebbing European diplomatic effort to turn back Iran's advancing nuclear program. "I think the question isn't why won't we talk to Tehran. The question is why doesn't Tehran want to talk to us." Iran did not accept Rice's offer for the first Cabinet-level direct talks in nearly three decades because of the condition to stop enriching uranium. Enriched uranium is an ingredient for both the peaceful nuclear power Iran claims it wants or for the illicit weapons program that Washington suspects. "I repeat again that if Iran is prepared to take that course then we are prepared to change 27 years of American policy and sit with Iran to talk about whatever Iran would like to talk about," Rice said. "But that can't be done when Iran continues to ... try to perfect technologies that are going to lead to a nuclear weapon." Since Rice's offer, the Bush administration has embarked on a more cautious outreach to Iran. U.S. and Iranian diplomats have met twice to discuss the spiral of violence in . The United States accuses Iran of arming insurgents in next-door Iran, but Iran denies it. The disputed nuclear issue hangs over those limited talks. Tehran recently suggested a readiness to discuss a partial suspension of uranium enrichment, but the U.S. and key allies rejected the overture and Iran pulled back from the idea for starting talks on its nuclear program, diplomats said Wednesday With both sides back at their hard-line stances, an exploratory meeting Thursday between Iran's chief international negotiator and the European Union's senior foreign policy official was unlikely to make substantial headway, the diplomats told The Associated Press. In another sign of defiance, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad boasted that his country's military has become so strong that no adversary would risk an attack. "We have passed our point of vulnerability," he told Iranian state television. Later Thursday, Rice skipped on opportunity to continue a public argument with over U.S. plans to base a missile interceptor system in Europe. Speaking at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Rice did not mention Russia or the controversy that has dominated increasingly troubled U.S.-Russian relations in recent months. Rice referred to the Cold War roots of the organization, begun as a bulwark against the Soviet Union, and said its expansion to include all manner of nations proves her theory that some historical events that seem impossible one day become inevitable. "That is for me, a great benefit and a great inspiration in a world that is in a great deal of turmoil now," Rice said.

"There will be a full investigation," said Maj. John Thomas, a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force. "We will try to determine everything that happened and to fully investigate the site." A U.S. military official, who insisted on speaking anonymously because the crash was still under investigation, said initial reports suggested the helicopter was hit with a rocket-propelled grenade Wednesday evening. A purported Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, claimed in a phone call to The Associated Press that militants shot the helicopter down in southern Helmand province, the world's largest opium poppy-growing region where combat has been heavy in recent months. Ahmadi did not offer any proof for his claim, but he specified the helicopter crashed in the Kajaki district hours before NATO reported that information. Kajaki is the site of a hydroelectric dam and the scene of recent fighting. NATO said troops going to the crash site were ambushed by enemy fighters and the unit called in an airstrike "to eliminate the enemy threat." It did not say if the troops were from the U.S.-led coalition, NATO's force or the Afghan army. One civilian was injured by gunfire. The CH-47 Chinook, a heavy transport helicopter with two rotors, can carry around 40 soldiers plus a small crew. The fact it was flying at night suggested the aircraft might have been carrying troops on a nighttime air assault. Kajaki is the site of a large U.S.-funded hydroelectric dam now being repaired so it can provide electricity to the southern city of Kandahar. British troops, who make up the bulk of the forces in Helmand province, have been engaged in fierce fighting around the dam protecting it. The NATO force, which is responsible for a countrywide counterinsurgency campaign, has 37,000 soldiers, including about 14,000 Americans. There are 12,000 U.S. troops in the separate U.S.-led coalition, which trains the Afghan army and conducts Special Forces anti-terrorism operations. Helicopter crashes in Afghanistan have been relatively rare. A Chinook crashed in February in the southern province of Zabul, killing eight U.S. personnel. Officials ruled out enemy fire as the cause. In May 2006, another Chinook crashed attempting a nighttime landing on a small mountaintop in eastern Kunar province, killing 10 U.S. soldiers. In 2005, a U.S. helicopter crashed in Kunar, after apparently being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, killing 16 Americans. Elsewhere, a senior military officer said the U.S. had "the Taliban on their heels" in Afghanistan. Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Pentagon reporters that "the Taliban has suffered numerous losses and has suffered losses to their senior leadership over this past month" in southern and eastern Afghanistan. As a result, the Taliban has "reverted to asymmetric-type, small-scale, high-profile attacks," he said. Mullah Dadullah, a one-legged veteran who orchestrated an intensifying campaign of suicide attacks and beheadings, was killed in an operation in southern Afghanistan this month. He had been considered the top Taliban field commander. Still, Wiggins said that as the poppy harvest ends, more insurgents might join the battle. "So the fight's not over," he said. "But we'll continue to take the offensive through several of the operations we have in Afghanistan, and hopefully ... continue to inflict casualties on the Taliban."

Despised by Beijing for asserting self-ruled Taiwan's sovereignty, Lee could earn yet more wrath if he goes to the Yasukuni Shrine, which many in Asia see as a symbol of Japan's wartime militarism. The week's events from around the world, captured in pictures. VIEW THIS WEEK'S PHOTOS Save & Share Article Although Japan says Lee's 11-day stay is for tourism only, China suggested that the trip would hurt ties already strained by issues stemming from Japan's World War Two aggression and disputes over borders and energy resources. "The aim of Lee Teng-hui's visit to Japan is to push forward Taiwan independence and to undermine China-Japan relations," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a regular news conference. "We feel strongly dissatisfied with Japan for allowing Lee to visit the country." China considers Taiwan, which Japan colonized for half a century up to 1945, as its sovereign territory. Lee, who led Taiwan from 1988 to 2000, said on Thursday he would like to visit Yasukuni, but sidestepped the issue of whether he would actually do so. Yasukuni honors millions of Japanese war dead -- among them soldiers from Taiwan and Korea who fought for their colonial ruler at the time -- but also a handful of convicted war criminals, including wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo. Lee's elder brother died fighting for the Japanese. "I still haven't said anything to anybody," he told reporters when asked if he would visit Yasukuni. "My older brother is honored there, and in 60 years I haven't been once. If it was your big brother, what would your feelings be?" A visit could further annoy Beijing and risk damaging the still fragile improvement of Sino-Japanese ties, only recently beginning to warm up after years of chill. The turning point was the departure last year of prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, whose regular visits to Yasukuni brought routine condemnation from Beijing. His replacement, Shinzo Abe, has so far avoided going to the shrine. But Jiang hinted on Thursday that Japan was not doing its part to keep relations on an even keel. "It takes the efforts of both sides to maintain the stable development of relations between China and Japan," she said. "We hope Japan can attach importance to China's serious concern, and properly resolve the issues of history and Taiwan through actions," she said. Beijing claims sovereignty over Taiwan. Ever since 1949, when China's Nationalist forces fled to the island after losing power on the mainland to Mao Zedong's Communists, it has demanded the Taiwan authorities accept reunification. On Thursday Japanese-educated Lee, accompanied by his wife, visited a museum to the Japanese haiku poet Matsuo Basho. During his stay, Lee is set to receive a prize in memory of Japanese colonial administrator Shinpei Goto and tour Japanese temples throughout the country.

The data were drawn from the United Nations, the World Bank, peace groups and the magazine researchers' own assessments.

Dudley George was shot and killed by a police sniper in Ipperwash Provincial Park on Sept. 6, 1995. His family has waited for more than 11 years for a public inquiry to answer some of the questions surrounding his death. Commissioner Sidney Linden found HarrisÂ did not order provincial police into Ipperwash Provincial Park to remove unarmed aboriginal protesters, butÂ he could have "urged patience, rather than speed" at resolving the dispute. "The federal government, the provincial government and the OPP must all assume some responsibility for decisions or failures that increased the risk of violence and make a tragic confrontation more likely," Linden said. George, 38, was killed by a police sniper's bullet as Ontario Provincial Police moved in on the occupation by unarmed protesters atÂ the parkÂ on the shores of Lake Huron on Sept. 6, 1995. LindenÂ said in his final report, released in Forest, Ont.,Â that he didn't believeÂ Harris when he claimed he never made a racist statement about the occupiers during an informal governmentÂ meeting with provincial policeÂ just hours beforeÂ George's death. Commissioner Sidney Linden called for the disputed land along the shores of Lake Huron to be returned immediately to the Stoney Point First Nation, along with compensation. Harris acknowledged during his testimony that he wanted the occupation brought to a quick end, but denied he said, "I want the fucking Indians out of the park," as former Ontario attorney general Charles Harnick alleged during his ownÂ testimony. "After carefully assessing the evidence, it is my view that Michael Harris made the statement," Linden wrote. "I agree with Premier Harris's characterization of the statement â€¦ as racist." Harris's sense of urgency, in contrast toÂ the "go-slow" approach of police,Â "created an atmosphere that narrowed the scope" of potential peaceful resolution to the occupation, Linden said. "The provincial government could have appointed a mediator or negotiator at any time, but did not," Linden wrote. "The premier could have urged patience, rather than speed." 'Damning indictment,' Falconer says Sam George, Dudley George's brother, praised Linden's findings as a "huge and wise step forward for natives and non-natives together."Â  "I hope it is as good for you as it is for us today," Georgeâ€™s brother said Thursday. Former premier Mike Harris, seen testifying at the inquiry in Forest, Ont., denied making a racial statement at an informal government meeting hours before George was killed. GeorgeÂ saidÂ his brother's legacy is that "he stood up for what he believed inÂ â€¦ and for that he paid the ultimate price." He added it would be appropriate for Harris to apologize to hisÂ family. Â  "I think that's not too much to ask," he said. But Harris's lawyer, Peter Downard, said the report showed no apology is required from the former premier. "He did nothing wrong," Downard told reporters Thursday. The finding that Harris uttered the commentÂ is "absolutely historic," said Julian Falconer,Â a lawyer forÂ theÂ Aboriginal Legal Services of Toronto who participated in the inquiry. "This is a damning indictment," FalconerÂ told reporters after the commissioner presented his findings. "Mike Harris has a lot to account for." The inquiry also blames the OPP for ill-informed actions, cultural insensitivity and racism, faulty intelligence and poor communications. Senior OPP officers on the scene relied on "unverified and inaccurate information" when the police raid was launched, Linden said. Linden alsoÂ faulted the federal government for expropriating disputed First Nations land for military use during the Second World War, then in a series of "successive neglects," failing to give it back as promised. In the more than 60 years following the action, the Stoney Point band tried to get the land back, claiming it contained a burial ground destroyed when the military camp was built. About 30 unarmed protesters occupied the park in the summer of 1995 in response to what they said were decades of frustration overÂ the unsettled land claim. Premier Dalton McGuinty launched the inquiry into the clash at Ipperwash only days after his Liberals swept to power in 2003. Linden called for the disputed land to be returned immediately to the Stoney Point First Nation, along with compensation. The report's other recommendations: Ontario should establish a permanent, independent and impartial agency to facilitate and oversee the settling of land and treaty claims. Ontario should improve public education about its land claim policies as well as aboriginal burial and heritage sites. Access to the Ontario land claims process should depend on whether the documentation filed by the First Nations provides clear evidence that there's been a breach of the legal obligations of the Crown. The OPP should establish a formal consultation committee with major aboriginal organizations in Ontario. Provincial police should establish an internal process to ensure racist and culturally insensitive behaviour by police is dealt with publicly. The province should establish and fund an Ontario Aboriginal Reconciliation Fund. With files from the Canadian Press YOUR VIEW: What is your reaction to the findings of the report?

Place a classified newspaper ad Balibo demand cop investigated By Rhett Watson and Cindy Wockner June 01, 2007 12:00 THE police officer who tried to subpoena an Indonesian politician possibly connected to the Balibo Five deaths is now under investigation as part of the diplomatic fallout. News of the internal review of the officer's actions came as NSW Premier Morris Iemma last night said he had written to Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso apologising for any distress and inconvenience during his stay in Sydney. "I apologise for the distress and inconvenience caused and regret your early departure from New South Wales," Mr Iemma wrote. Hundreds of angry protesters shouting anti-Australian slogans yesterday converged on the Australian Embassy in Jakarta for the second day. Indonesia has complained bitterly about the treatment of Mr Sutiyoso, who says police entered his Sydney hotel room unannounced to confront him on Tuesday afternoon. The NSW Coroner's Court confirmed yesterday that the officer had a subpoena for Mr Sutiyoso to appear before the Balibo Five coronial inquest, but delivered a verbal invitation when he realised the former general was in his room at the Shangri-La Hotel. Mr Sutiyoso, a retired military lieutenant-general, denies involvement in the 1975 Balibo shooting murders of five Australian newsmen, for whom war crimes charges may be brought. Police sources say Sergeant Steve Thomas, who was under instructions from the Deputy State Coroner, broke no laws in confronting the politician and his actions were now under review because of the political firestorm. Foreign Minister Alexander Downer spoke to his Indonesian counterpart Hassan Wirajuda last night, promising the matter would be investigated. "What the Governor claims is that he was having a rest in his room and two policemen just walked in . . . and suggested he may wish to go to a hearing of . . . a coroner's court," Mr Downer said. "He was, of course, outraged at this." Mr Sutiyoso, who returned to Jakarta on Tuesday night, left a 30-minute meeting with Australia's Ambassador Bill Farmer yesterday to say that the diplomat had told him he would "take care" to get a formal letter of apology. "I forgive him, he is an Ambassador, he represents Australia in Indonesia and he, in front of me and some of my staff, conveyed his apology and was very shocked and disappointed with that incident. We are a big-hearted country. Why shouldn't I forgive that?" The attempt to subpoena the senior Jakarta politician, tipped as a possible presidential candidate, sparked a chorus of condemnation from Indonesians and created a diplomatic row between the two countries. The second day of protests at the Embassy prompted the Department of Foreign Affairs to add civil unrest to its travel warning for Indonesia. Shangri-La management has revealed that the police officers arrived on Tuesday afternoon and requested access to Mr Sutiyoso's room. Staff then called the Governor's room, but when there was no answer they escorted the officers upstairs. "One of our staff rang the doorbell &ndash; they rang it a few times &ndash; and there was no answer," a spokeswoman said. The officers were let into the room, only to find Mr Sutiyoso inside. A police spokesman confirmed an internal review had begun.

http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-usfred0531,0,5517948.story%3Fcoll%3Dny-leadnationalnews-headlines&cid Actor Fred Thompson tests presidential waters - Newsday.com New York City News Actor Fred Thompson tests presidential waters WASHINGTON -- Actor Fred Thompson is taking a big step toward running for president, and early polls show the "Law & Order" TV prosecutor is likely to cut into support for a prominent real-life ex-prosecutor, Rudolph Giuliani. The former Tennessee senator will form a "testing the waters" committee in coming days that clears the way for him to enter the presidential race, possibly as soon as the July Fourth weekend, Thompson supporters said Wednesday. His entry would be sure to jumble an already volatile Republican field, where Giuliani leads in national polls despite deep doubts about him and two other top candidates among conservatives, who have been casting about for an ideological heir to Ronald Reagan. As a 6-foot-5 actor with a honey-dipped drawl, Thompson certainly looks the part, and he's got a solid conservative voting record to match, even if that record lacks major legislative accomplishments or executive experience. The idea of a Thompson candidacy has enticed some voters enough to push him into third place in national polls -- ahead of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who several analysts said yesterday has the most to lose if Thompson can pick up the conservative voters Romney is banking on. But Giuliani would suffer too if conservatives rally to Thompson's side and see in him what they have seen in the ex-mayor -- an electable candidate with the aura of celebrity. In Thompson's case, he has the added benefit of being in line with conservatives on issues like abortion and gun control, unlike Giuliani. "One of Giuliani's great strengths is that there was nobody in the race who could consolidate party support, and if Thompson does prove to be a strong candidate, he may be suddenly able to galvanize the right, which would be a problem for the mayor," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in Washington. Giuliani Wednesday welcomed a Thompson candidacy. "He has a great deal to offer," Giuliani said. "We'll all get a chance to make our point and I'm very comfortable with the idea that the Republican Party members get to decide who the candidate's going to be." Early polling on the race has suggested that a Thompson entry would draw voters away from Giuliani -- with a CNN poll earlier this month showing Giuliani dropping 9 points since March, while Thompson moved from zero in March to 13. A Quinnipiac poll this month showed Giuliani down 13 points and .Thompson up 14 since February. Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford), a former backer of John McCain in 2000 who is now supporting Giuliani, said .Thompson's entry would cause problems for the Arizona senator because they have an almost identical voting record. He acknowledged Thompson could cause problems for Giuliani down the line as well, but said he believes voters will see the difference between real life and TV when they are looking for a strong leader. "Rudy had 9/11, and Fred .Thompson had 'Law & Order,'" King said. Subscribe to Newsday home delivery Article licensing and reprint options Post a comment |

Tribunal Condemned by Syria, Others - Forbes.com U.N. Tribunal Condemned by Syria, Others 05.31.07, 8:50 AM ET Both Syria and the Lebanese opposition that it supports criticized the United Nations on Thursday for its decision to establish a tribunal to prosecute the killers of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Also Thursday, Lebanon reopened the road where Hariri was killed by a suicide truck bomb in February 2005. Beirut Mayor Abdel-Monem al-Ariss said the spot would remain "a historic symbol in the heart of Beirut." The tribunal has been at the core of a political crisis between the pro-Western government in Beirut and the Hezbollah-led opposition that has erupted into street clashes in recent months, killing 11 people. U.S.-backed Prime Minister Fuad Saniora had asked the council earlier this month to establish the tribunal, citing the refusal of opposition-aligned Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to convene a session to ratify the creation of the tribunal. Berri rejected these accusations Thursday, reflecting the opposition's bitterness over the government's move to take the issue to the U.N. "It is an honor I claim that I don't violate the constitution of my country or indulge in sowing divisions among its sons, and I left for you the opposite 'honor': ignoring (national) reconciliation and the constitution that guides us in Lebanon," Berri said in a brief statement. Syria, which has been implicated in Hariri's assassination by the U.N., was also quick to criticize the establishment of the tribunal under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which deals with threats to international peace and allows military enforcement. Shortly after the vote late Wednesday, Syria's official news agency, citing an unidentified official, said: "The formation of the international court under Chapter 7 is considered as a degradation of Lebanon's sovereignty that might lead to more deterioration of the situations on the Lebanese field." Syrian newspapers on Thursday also criticized the decision as an American-Israeli effort to exact revenge on Damascus, an opponent of both. Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied involvement in the assassination and threatened not to cooperate with the tribunal if it infringes on Syrian national sovereignty. Police cleared roadblocks in front of the 328-yard stretch of road where Hariri and 22 others were killed. The seaside boulevard had been closed for more than two years while the U.N. scoured the ground, adjacent buildings and the nearby Mediterranean Sea for evidence. Among the first to drive through was a passenger minivan, whose driver stopped, got out of the vehicle, knelt and kissed the ground, saying: "God have mercy on your soul." Earlier, Carole Farhat, who survived the bombing two years ago, watched as laborers filled the bomb crater with gravel and paved over it. She said she was glad to be alive "to enjoy this moment." "I've come to see the spot where I was seconds away from death. It might be a good sign for Lebanon and for us," said Farhat, who was thrown in the air by the bombing as she crossed the road. She lost much of her hearing and sustained injuries to her eyes. Daniel Germani, an engineer who was also injured in the bombing, said the reopening of the road would allow his team to repair the famous St. George Hotel, which was severely damaged in the blast. Five hotel employees were killed and eight were wounded, he said. He estimated damages to the hotel at $10 million, saying they had yet to receive compensation. The U.N. resolution gives the Lebanese parliament a last chance to establish the tribunal itself. If it doesn't act by June 10, the U.N. decision will automatically "enter into force." Saad Hariri, leader of the parliamentary majority and the son of the late prime minister, and Saniora have extended a hand to the opposition after the tribunal's approval. But ratification by the parliament so far appears unlikely entangled. Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militant group backed by Iran and Syria, had already warned against establishing the tribunal without parliamentary approval. Saad Hariri said after the vote late Wednesday the decision was a turning point in Lebanon that would protect the country from further assassinations. The vote is a "victory the world has given to oppressed Lebanon and a victory for an oppressed Lebanon in the world," he said, holding back tears at the end of his televised speech. Saniora, a longtime confidant of Rafik Hariri, also called the tribunal "a triumph for Lebanon against injustice, crime and tyranny." He urged the Lebanese to put their differences behind, saying the approval of the tribunal was a "positive step" for renewed dialogue to work together. Copyright 2007 Associated Press.

Bush had sought to have him killed. "Oh, my goodness," replied White House spokesman Tony Snow, when questioned about an article released on Monday in which Castro claimed: "I am not the first and will not be the last that Bush ordered deprived of life." "It's Fidel Castro," was the spokesman's only explanation. The 80-year-old communist leader, a long-time foe of Washington, has kept out of view since July 2006 when he fell ill but has kept up communications in recent months with a series of articles in the communist daily Granma. Monday's was his 13th article in two months. He has said he had several operations but the precise nature of his ailment remains a mystery. Castro came to power in 1959 when his forces toppled the US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. The United States considers Castro a major adversary and has long supported Cuban opponents of his government. In Monday's article, he alleged that Bush was recently queried "by an important person" over his Cuba policy and replied, according to the Cuban leader: "I am a hard-line president and I only await Castro's death."

Jakarta governor Sutiyoso cut short his trip to Sydney and demanded an apology after saying police had entered his hotel room uninvited as he slept. He said they wanted him to testify at an inquest into the deaths of five journalists in East Timor in 1975. New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma said he was "disturbed" by the report. "I apologise for the distress and inconvenience caused and regret your early departure from New South Wales," he wrote in a letter to Gov Sutiyoso, made public to news outlets. He said a review of the circumstances surrounding the incident revealed the state's "co-ordination of security and protocol was less than satisfactory". "This is extremely disappointing to me," he added. The apology appears to have dampened diplomatic tensions that had risen over the incident. Indonesia had lodged a formal protest. Gov Sutiyoso had been in Sydney at the invitation of the state government when police allegedly entered his hotel room as he slept. "They barged into my room after forcing the hotel to give them a duplicate key," he told reporters after returning to Jakarta. He said they asked him to sign an invitation to testify at the inquest into the five journalists who were killed in the East Timor town of Balibo on October 1975. Australia and Indonesia have always said the journalists died accidentally, having been caught in crossfire as Indonesian troops entered the town. A senior lawyer told the inquest on Wednesday that far from being an accident, the journalists deliberately shot by Indonesian troops after they tried to surrender, according to the testimony of witnesses. Gov Sutiyoso, a former general, said he had served in East Timor in 1975 but was never stationed in Balibo.

Professor William Gray’s team also kept with the prediction of a 74 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the United States coastline. Hurricane season starts Friday and runs through Nov. 30. Gray’s team says cooler Pacific Ocean waters near the equator should result in fewer trade winds this year to suppress hurricanes. It’s the opposite cycle to the El Nino last year that warmed the Pacific and drove more trade winds to shear apart storms in their early stages. “El Nino conditions during the summer and fall, similar to those that developed in 2006, tend to decrease Atlantic hurricane activity by increasing vertical wind shear across the area where Atlantic tropical cyclones develop,” Phil Klotzbach of the Colorado State team said in a prepared statement. Only 10 named storms -- five hurricanes and two major hurricanes -- developed last year. The long-term averages over the past 55 years is 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes per year. Earlier this month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it expects 13 to 17 named storms this year, including seven to 10 hurricanes — three to five with winds greater than 110 mph. NOAA anticipates a 75 percent chance of above normal season, a 20 percent chance near normal, and a 5 percent chance below normal season. NOAA officials said most tropical storms and hurricanes should form August through October over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, as is typical for above-normal seasons. Historically, above-normal seasons average two-to-four hurricane landfalls in the continental United States. Also this month, a University of Central Florida statistics professor and his Georgia colleague estimated Brevard County has a 19.4 percent chance of at least 74 mph winds this season, compared with the long-term average of 8.6 percent chance of winds that strong.

"It wasn&#145;t us who initiated a new round of arms race," Putin said when asked about Russia&#145;s missile tests this week at a news conference after talks in the Kremlin with Greek President Karolos Papoulias. He assailed the United States and other NATO members for failing to ratify an amended version of the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, which limits the deployment of heavy non-nuclear weapons around the continent. "And what about our partners? They are filling Eastern Europe with new weapons. A new base in Bulgaria, another one in Romania, a (missile defense) site in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic," he said. "What we are supposed to do? We can&#145;t just sit back and look at that." Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly rejected U.S. assurances that the planned missile defense installations are meant to counter a potential threat from nations such as Iran and pose no danger to Russia. "Either you ratify the treaty and start observing it, or we will opt out of it," Putin said. "It&#145;s dangerous and harmful," he added. "Norms of the international law were replaced with political expediency. We view it as diktat and imperialism." Putin described the tests of new missiles conducted by Russia on Tuesday as a necessary response to the Western action. In one missile test Tuesday, a prototype of new Russia&#145;s intercontinental ballistic missile, called the RS-24, was fired from a mobile launcher at the Plesetsk launch site in northwestern Russia and its test warhead landed on target 3,400 miles away on the Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, officials said. Russia&#145;s military also tested a new cruise missile based on the existing short-range Iskander missile. -- -- -- -- A publication by the Path Publishing Group.

The troops were ambushed south of Baghdad nearly three weeks ago. Four soldiers were killed in the initial attack and the body of a third kidnapped soldier was found days later. Brigadier General Perry Wiggins says there has been a side benefit to the search. Patrols have uncovered weapons caches and bomb-making facilities. The general says the hunt is also continuing for five British citizens who've been kidnapped, saying the US is doing all it can to find them. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"First and foremost, it&#39;s been a tough month," Brigadier General Perry Wiggins, deputy director of regional operations with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at a Defence Department briefing. May has been one of the deadliest months for US troops in Iraq. The deadliest was November of 2004, when 137 US troops died in Iraq, followed by April 2004 with 135. Wiggins said that the higher casualties were not entirely unexpected, given the "operational risks" associated with President George W Bush&#39;s "surge" of thousands of additional American troops into some of Iraq&#39;s most dangerous hotspots. "We&#39;re moving into places where we haven&#39;t been, not necessarily before," Wiggins said. "We&#39;re having more contacts with the enemy." At least 3 465 US forces have died in Iraq since the March 2003 US-led invasion, many while fighting the ongoing insurgency there.

"In this regard we believe that the Security Council must act on behalf of the international community impartially and without any political bias," the Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on the resolution which was tabled Wednesday. "South Africa as a matter of principle abstained on voting for the current resolution on Lebanon in the Security Council." The resolution imposes the formation of a Special Tribunal to prosecute any people identified by the Lebanese authorities and the United Nations International Independent Investigation Commission, as suspects in the assassination of the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafiq Hariri and other prominent Lebanese leaders. South Africa embarked on the first year of its two-year non-permanent tenure in the Security Council in January, and was Council President in March. Following Mr Hariri&#39;s death as a result of a car bomb in 2005, President Thabo Mbeki extended South Africa&#39;s heartfelt condolences to the government and the people of Lebanon. Mr Hariri was also a major stakeholer in the mobile phone service provider, Cell-C. South Africa believes imposing the Special Tribunal under the current circumstances will detrimentally affect the political stability of the already fragile Lebanese State, explained the department. Further to this, the move would politicise international criminal law and thus undermine the very foundations of international law. "South Africa, joins other members of the Security Council in calling for the Lebanese ownership of the process and for the Security Council to respect the sovereignty and constitution of Lebanon and to refrain from taking sides in internal Lebanese politics," said the department. "For South Africa, the key principle is that all violators of international law including international humanitarian law in Lebanon are brought to justice and not only those who perpetrate criminal acts against one faction within Lebanon." Following Wednesday&#39;s vote, Government reiterated its strong condemnation of the assassination of former Prime Minister and called for a thorough investigation into the incident. "In this regard there exists general consensus within Lebanon and internationally for the UN to assist the Lebanese authorities in their efforts to bring to justice those responsible for this heinous act," the department said. "There is also widespread support for the creation of a Special Tribunal based outside Lebanon and composed of both international and Lebanese judges as well as prosecutors." Accordingly South Africa supports the need for a Special Tribunal to ensure those responsible for these horrific crimes to be brought to justice. "However, our view is that the Tribunal should be the product of consensus within Lebanon as required by the Lebanese constitution and not an imposition of the Security Council," the department said. During another major Security Council vote in January, South Africa voted against a draft resolution regarding the situation in Myanmar, the former Burma. The country views the situation there as a human rights issue which should be handled by the proper organ within the UN, namely the UN Human Rights Council. Political analyst at the University of South Africa, Jo-Ansie van Wyk told BuaNews that South Africa&#39;s decision was in line with its foreign policy. "In terms of its foreign policy, South Africa wants to use the right organs for the right issues and its decision to vote against the resolution is about playing by the rules," Ms Van Wyk said. "The issue is work specific to the UN Human Rights Council, which is why South Africa is against the burdening of other UN organs with work that is outside their mandate." The resolution also called for the release of Myanmar&#39;s Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, which Mr Pahad said South Africa supported. During South Africa&#39;s tenure as Council President in March, an important resolution was also tabled regarding Iran&#39;s nuclear energy programme. Adopting resolution 1747 (2007), submitted by France, Germany and the United Kingdom, the Council affirmed its decision that Iran should suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development, to be verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). International Organizations and Africa Middle East and Africa This resulted in the Security Council widening the scope of its December 2006 sanctions against Iran for its refusal to abandon all its Uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. However, before the resolution was adopted, South Africa, later joined by Indonesia, had called for certain amendments to be made to the draft resolution to make it "proportionate, incremental and reversible" for the Council, said South Africa&#39;s Ambassador to the UN Dumisani Kumalo. South Africa has long supported Iran&#39;s and other nations&#39; use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, and is a signatory of the Nuclear Non-proliferation treaty. &copy; 2007 BuaNews.

Although hardly a megawatt star , he brings positive attributes to the job. First, as a key player in bringing China into the World Trade Organisation, Zoellick is a proven internationalist in a US administration in which internationalists have sometimes seemed like an endangered species. Second, he is a firm believer in the power of markets and free trade, which have clearly done far more to alleviate poverty over the past half-century than any aid programme. Third, he seems to have been a consistent behind the scenes supporter of the World Bank, whereas many of his Bush administration colleagues would be just as happy to see it shut down and its Washington headquarters turned into private condominiums and offices. So, presumably, he has a constructive vision for the bank&#x2019;s future. But Zoellick is not without his weaknesses. First and foremost, his appointment extends the outmoded practice of always installing an American in the job. With the bank tirelessly preaching the merits of good governance, its failure to adopt democratic principles undercuts its own legitimacy. The claim that the World Bank needs an American president to ensure that the US keeps donating money is ridiculous. The annual cost of the US contribution to the World Bank is relatively minor. Any number of developing countries, from China to Brazil, could easily step up if the US foolishly stepped down. Zoellick&#x2019;s background as a lawyer hardly makes him perfect for the job, either. The World Bank presidency is not about negotiating treaties, as Zoellick did when he was US trade representative. The bank&#x2019;s most important role in development today is as a &#x201C;knowledge bank&#x201D; that helps aggregate, distill and disseminate best practices from around the world. In this respect, the bank&#x2019;s technical assistance to governments is very similar to what private consultants offer to companies. Moreover, many of the World Bank president&#x2019;s most important decisions involve economics in an essential way. Wrong economic decisions, such as in the 1970s when Robert McNamara pushed grandiose but environmentally devastating infrastructure projects, have haunted the bank for decades. The biggest question mark, though, is whether Zoellick will be able to hit the ground running and implement desperately needed reforms. Reform number one, of course, is to ensure that the next World Bank president is not an American. Rodrigo de Rato, Zoellick&#x2019;s counterpart at the European-dominated International Monetary Fund (IMF), has already suggested that his successor should be chosen in a more inclusive process. The bank should be ashamed that its president has not yet offered a similar proposal. Second, Zoellick should ask why the bank spends only 2,5% of its budget on the &#x201C;knowledge bank&#x201D; research function it trumpets in its external relations materials, while it spends three times that amount on maintaining its executive board. Third, Zoellick should use his formidable negotiating skills to cajole rich countries into greatly increasing the grant component of World Bank aid. The idea that a big government-guaranteed global bank is needed to fill holes in private capital markets is laughable nowadays. True, the bank&#x2019;s poorest clients have little access to private capital markets. By and large, however, the poorest countries need grants, not loans that they still won&#x2019;t be able to pay in 20 years. As the bank switches from loans to grants, it can use some of its massive retained earnings to endow its &#x201C;knowledge bank&#x201D; function and related technical advice. But all this knowledge shouldn&#x2019;t be free. A lot of technical advice falls on deaf ears, with countries listening only long enough to get their hands on bank money. Instead of merely pushing its agenda, the bank should start charging for its technical advice on a graduated scale so that more of its engagements are client-driven. Last but not least, the bank needs to play a much bigger role in environmental issues and, in general, in promoting good international citizenship. Of course, Zoellick could just attempt to fill the role symbolically and do little or nothing, as some of his predecessors have done. Or, less likely, he could embrace some megalomaniacal vision of government intervention, as others have tried. In any case, let&#x2019;s wish him luck. The world needs the World Bank a lot more than it needs another condominium.

Police say three children were in Banaszewski's minivan when she was stopped and refused to take a breath test for alcohol. A license suspension is automatic in such cases. A spokesman for the DuPage County State's Attorney's office says Banaszewski, who lives in Wheaton, must also pay a fine of $$2,155 and work 140 hours of public service.

Speaking a week before he meets leaders of the Group of Eight (G-8) industrial nations in Germany, Putin said Russia's tests on Tuesday of a two new missiles were a direct response to U.S. moves to create a missile defense system. "We are not the initiators of this new round of the arms race," Putin told a joint Kremlin news conference with visiting Greek President Karolos Papoulias. "There is no need to fear Russia's actions: they are not aggressive," he said. "They are a mere response to harsh and groundless unilateral actions by our partners and are aimed at maintaining the balance of forces in the world." Putin's comments, which will be popular among ordinary Russians in a year when there is a parliamentary election, are the latest in a line of harsh outbursts against the West. Russia on Tuesday test-fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile with multiple warheads and a new cruise missiles, which Russian generals say are sufficient to ensure the country's security for the next 40 years. "Our partners are stuffing eastern Europe with new weapons," Putin said. "What are we supposed to do? We cannot just observe all this." Moscow has been alarmed by U.S. plans to deploy elements of its global missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Washington says it wants to avert attacks from "rogue states" such as Iran but Russia sees a threat to its own security. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Click me to Learning from Ipperwash will help prevent future violent protests: commissioner Two aboriginal protesters man a barricade near the entrance to Ipperwash Provincial Park, near Ipperwash Beach, Ont., on Sept. 7, 1995. (CPimages '95) Chinta Puxley, Canadian Press Published: Thursday, May 31, 2007 FOREST, Ont. (CP) - The federal government's unwillingness to settle aboriginal land claims, the impatience of the Conservative Ontario government and the cultural insensitivity of the provincial police all contributed to the shooting death of unarmed aboriginal protester Dudley George in Ipperwash Provincial Park 12 years ago, an exhaustive public inquiry concluded Thursday. "It is impossible to attribute Mr. George's death to a single person, factor, decision or institution," Commissioner Sydney Linden said following the release of his four-volume report on the police shooting in September 1995. "On the contrary, it was the combination of these that made a violent result more likely, particularly when they all came together in the space of a few short days and hours in the context of a highly-charged confrontation. Individuals and institutions need to be held accountable for the consequences of their decisions and actions, whether those consequences were intended or not." "The federal government, the provincial government, and the OPP must all assume some responsibility for decisions or failures that increased the risk of violence and make a tragic confrontation more likely." While the federal government has allowed aboriginal land claims "to fester for decades," Linden faulted then-premier Mike Harris for giving police 24 hours to remove aboriginal protesters from Ipperwash Provincial Park, just days after they occupied it claiming it was the site of a sacred burial ground. Harris uttered a racial slur at a meeting hours before George was shot by a police sniper, Linden concluded, but the premier did not direct police to enter the park or prompt them to conduct the botched raid. "After carefully assessing the evidence, it is my view that Michael Harris made the statement 'I want the f**king Indians out of the park'," Linden wrote. "I agree with Premier Harris's characterization of the statement . . . as racist." The government's "imperative for speed" and its reluctance to examine the legitimacy of the aboriginal claim made it virtually impossible for either side to negotiate an end to the dispute, Linden concluded. "The provincial government could have appointed a mediator or negotiator at any time, but did not," Linden wrote. "The premier could have urged patience, rather than speed." Provincial police also made negotiation unlikely because of their "cultural insensitivity," poor communication and unwillingness to involve aboriginal mediators, Linden said. "Cultural insensitivity and racism on the part of some of the OPP officers involved were evident both before and after Dudley George's death and created a barrier to establishing effective communication and to developing a level of trust with the occupiers which in turn, made a timely, peaceful resolution of the occupation more difficult," Linden said following the release of his report.

Here are excerpts of his statement. ON THE BRITISH SECRET SERVICES' ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE POISONING "It's hard to get rid of the thought that Litvinenko was an agent who got out of the secret service's control and was eliminated. Even if it was not done by the secret service itself, it was done under its control or connivance." Asked if there was evidence of their direct participation, Lugovoi said: "There is." ON ALLEGEDLY BEING RECRUITED AS A BRITISH SPY Mr Lugovoi said in 2005 Mr Litvinenko invited him to London where he proposed the idea of starting a joint business. Mr Lugovoi went on to say that he was paid too much money for giving minor consultations to British business partners. "It became clear that the fee was aimed at gradually engaging me in co-operation. The talks were becoming more open. The British started to show interest in everything: my connections, financial opportunities, if I had direct access to the Russian president's administration, as well as contacts with officers of the Federal Security Service, the Federal Bodyguard Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service. They were especially interested in an opportunity to get information about the FSB activities in the so-called English direction. "They openly begun to recruit me as a British intelligence agent. The British, in essence, suggested that I gather any discrediting information about President Vladimir Putin and members of his family. For example, it was proposed that I gather information about a state official, through whom they intended to get discrediting information about the president. In particular, they intended to lure this state official to London in order to get discrediting information about the president in exchange for silence about his personal bank accounts. I will tell investigators of the prosecutor-general's office who I'm talking about. "For maintaining an undercover connection, I was given a British mobile phone, which I was supposed to use for calling from Moscow to London. From bad to worse: Litvinenko gave me an edition of Yevgeny Grishkovets' book Rubashka and told me that now we have to use cipher like in spy movies and to encode a text using numbers of pages, paragraphs and lines. "One has to be a complete idiot not to understand that under the pretext of developing a joint business, a banal recruiting was going on with concrete political and intelligence goals with regard to Russia and its president. "I do not regard myself a passionate supporter of President Putin and I have my personal reasons for that, which many can guess about. But I was taught to defend the motherland, not to betray it. During another meeting with Litvinenko, I told him straight everything I thought about that and said that I was not interested in such business." ON ALLEGEDLY BEING MADE A SCAPEGOAT Mr Lugovoi said the British had already made up their minds that he was guilty of killing Mr Litvinenko. "For a long time I was constrained by my obligations to the Crown Prosecution Service. I was willingly co-operating with the crown prosecutor's office and I was answering every question. I was also answering all the questions that the Scotland Yard investigators were asking me. Even then I had a feeling that all the questions were just a formality and the accused were already determined, that is myself and Dmitry Kovtun. But I tried to keep all the obligations... and I was made a scapegoat." He said the British had hoped he would stay silent, but that he was not going to allow them to push their agenda. "Just think of it: they have found a Russian James Bond, who enters into nuclear centres and in cold blood poisons a friend of his and, at the same time, poisons himself, his friends, children and wife. And all that was done single-handedly by the terrorist Lugovoi. Who - as a result - loses his business and clients. And the main question: what for? Where is the motive for my crime? "London was hoping that I would keep silent as I have not been extradited... and that all the questions would resolve themselves: I would be branded as a criminal; Berezovsky would get a very good reason not to be extradited to Russia; Scotland Yard and the British special services would save face in the eyes of their taxpayers; while Russia and its leadership would be discredited for a long time. "Only none of this will happen. I am prepared to lose even more money, but I will fight for my honest name. I understand that if I went to London, I - for the sake of preserving somebody's professional honour - would be convicted, no matter what. That is why in the very near future, as we have done before, I will hire serious lawyers in London in order to defend my honest name in the British law-enforcement agencies. "If the British authorities refuse to conduct a fair trial, I will be prepared to appeal to the international court in The Hague." ON WHY HE BELIEVES THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM ARE WRONG "Now I would like to return to the issue of [Litvinenko's] death. First, I don't think you have to be a lawyer to understand that a motive is needed to carry out a crime like this. Sasha [Litvinenko] was not my enemy. I did not have any opinion on what he was doing in London, which books he was writing and who he was criticising. I have been a businessman for a long time now, and this didn't really interest me. "Second, for some reason all British newspapers are saying that the poisoning took place on 1 November, but Litvinenko and I met twice in October. Moreover, we met in his home in summer, when his wife Marina was away. By the way, Berezovsky didn't know of that meeting. It was almost the ideal place for a poisoning. However, when conditions were ideal, it didn't happen. But in a bar with a lot of people, when he could have failed to turn up, in the presence of dozens of witnesses, it happened. This means that someone wanted us to be seen together in the Millennium Bar. "Third, those who know Sasha can confirm that he never drank or smoked. Neither I nor Dima [Dmitry Kovtun] can remember whether he ordered anything, tea or water, because we were preparing to go to a football game at the time and, since it was cold, had drunk a good amount of spirits. What kind of idiot poisoner would it take to act in such a primitive way? Again, somebody wanted to set us up. "Fourth, if the poisoning took place on 1 November, then how did the polonium leave traces [changes track], I underline, it only left traces in places in London where I and Litvinenko met in October. And why was the polonium found in aircraft on which Dima and I returned to Moscow and Germany respectively in October 2006? My only conclusion is that we were purposely marked with polonium in order to use us in a political scandal later. "[Fifth,] I came to London with my wife and children to go to a football game. As a consequence, all of them were checked for polonium poisoning and the results were not comforting. They were tested together with me in the hospital. What kind of monster would you have to be to expose the lives of your children and your wife to such threats? "Sixth, already in summer 2006 Litvinenko started giving me various little gifts. When I was tested in the hospital, all my things were checked. It turned out that souvenirs and a number of documents which Litvinenko had given me long before 1 November were splattered with polonium. I told our investigators in the Prosecutor-General's Office about this, but they said that their British colleagues weren't interested for some reason. It is possible that Litvinenko himself left the traces (of polonium), but this theory was unacceptable to the British justice from the very beginning. "Seventh, it is no longer a secret that all my meetings with Litvinenko were thoroughly followed by the UK secret services. Why didn't they follow up Litvinenko's poisoning and allow all of us to leave Britain without punishment? Why has the address where we met British agents, [names omitted], not been included among the dozens of places in London mentioned in the media where polonium has been found? I would like to know whether polonium traces was found in that office, which is in essence one of their secret meeting places."

PM Blair Lashes Out At Africa "Vanity Trip" Critics [] 5/31/2007 12:52:23 AM Prime Minister Tony Blair arrived in Sierra Leone to a warm welcome and has lashed out at critics back home of his week-long trip to Africa. Blair's trip, just before he steps down as PM, has come in for some sharp criticism at home, for spending his last few weeks in power globe trotting at taxpayers' expense. Tory leader David Cameron has accused him of behaving like a "pop star" on a farewell world tour which serves no purpose but to "indulge his vanity." Labor MPs are also said to be frowning over Blair's "farewell tour," which has taken him to the US, France and Iraq. Blair hit back saying "The one thing I have come to despise more than anything else in my 10 years is cynicism". He said there had been real progress in Sierra Leone where the British sent peacekeeping troops during his first term of office. Speaking after talks with the country's President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Blair said: "However ferocious the challenges are in this part of Africa it's better to intervene and try to make a difference than stay out and try to cope with the consequences at a later time." Sierra Leone, which is now stable but remains desperately poor with high levels of corruption, is expected to hold presidential elections in August, the first poll since UN peacekeepers left in 2005. UN Security Council Approves Hariri Murder Trial Court [] 5/31/2007 12:29:39 AM The UN Security Council on Tuesday unanimously approved a resolution in favor of the creation of an international court to try suspects in the murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Russia, China, South Africa, Indonesia and Qatar abstained from voting in the resolution that was adopted by 10 votes to zero. Lebanon must now ratify the proposal by June 10, failing which the Security Council may independently authorize a tribunal, as it did in the case Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Hariri and 22 others were killed in a massive car bomb in the capital, Beirut, on February 14, 2005. A UN investigation into the killing implicated Syria and Lebanese security forces in the attack, although Damascus strongly denied any involvement. Four pro-Syrian Lebanese generals accused in the murder have been under arrest for more than a year. Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora welcomed the Security Council resolution saying the ratification of the international tribunal is a victory for Lebanon, and for all the Lebanese. Rafik Hariri's son Saad Hariri, said the tribunal was a turning point for the country and "an opportunity for all Lebanese to unite". Syria reiterated its stance that the special court violated "Lebanese sovereignty" and could plunge Lebanon into further instability. Syrian President Bashar Assad has said any Syrial would not deport any Syrian suspects and they would be tried in Syria. Copyright &copy; 2007 RealTimeTraders.com, Inc. All rights reserved.

Two soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb during a foot patrol Wednesday, the military said without specifying the exact location. Another soldier died from a "non-battle related cause" in Baghdad Tuesday, bringing the total for May to 116, the highest since 137 troops died in the November 2004 full scale invasion of Fallujah. Speaking of May, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of regional operations with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at a Pentagon briefing, "First and foremost, it's been a tough month." Wiggins attributed the rise in casualties to an ongoing security crackdown, explaining that four years into the occupation, "we're moving into places where we haven't been, not necessarily before." The latest fatalities bring the number of US soldiers killed in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion to 3,468, according to an AFP count based on Pentagon figures. On Thursday, the US military said five Americans and two other soldiers died when a Chinook helicopter was apparently shot down in Afghanistan's Helmand province. Democrats in control of the US Congress have been pressing Bush to agree to a timetable for pulling troops from Iraq, an idea firmly opposed by the president. The White House said Wednesday Bush would like to see a lengthy US troop presence in Iraq like the one in South Korea. Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid immediately shot back, saying it is time for Bush to "recognize the reality on the ground in Iraq" that US troops are mired in Iraq and a change in course is urgently needed. "Democrats know that Americans demand realistic plans, not more White House rhetoric, rosy predictions and best-case scenarios," Reid said. Meanwhile, South Korea denied reports that it was leaning towards the extension of the stationing of its troops in Iraq. On Wednesday, a US television news claimed that South Korea has decided to extend the stay of the troops by another year while reducing the size of the contingent to 800 or 900. But South Korean Defense Minister said "there is no change in our position to submit a plan on terminating the mission of troops to parliament by the end of June". The latest fatalities bring the number of US soldiers killed in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion to 3,468. Make Alalam your homepage Copyright © 2004 - 2007 Alalam Inc.

Security Council vote to set up a tribunal to try the killers of Rafik al-Hariri, the former prime minister's son said on Thursday. Pro-Syrian politicians and parties, including President Emile Lahoud and Hezbollah, said the United Nations had ridden roughshod over Lebanon's constitution and could provoke further divisions in a country still haunted by its 1975-90 civil war. The Security Council voted on Wednesday to set up the court after failed efforts to get its statutes constitutionally approved in Lebanon, where a political crisis has paralyzed normal government for months. Syria said after the vote that it could lead to more instability in Lebanon. Saad al-Hariri, the son and political heir of the slain premier, told Reuters the tribunal would end the impunity that political assassins have enjoyed in Lebanon for four decades. "How could the tribunal affect the security of Lebanon? How could punishing the people who killed Rafik al-Hariri... affect the security of Lebanon?" Hariri said in an interview. "If Lebanon is going to be unstable it is the doing of those who say that Lebanon is going to be unstable," he said. "They (the Syrians) won't be able to destabilize us because they tried before and they have failed." Hariri and his allies in the governing coalition accuse Syria of orchestrating the February 14, 2005 bombing which killed Hariri and 22 others in Beirut. They also say Damascus was behind a string of other attacks on anti-Syrian figures. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

Leaders of the Group of Eight rich nations meet in Germany next week with President George W. Bush resisting pressure by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to agree to cap emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels. But Bush is not alone in presiding over rising emissions. "Growth rates ... of emissions in the U.S. are slowing," said Michael Raupach, of the Earth Observation Centre in Canberra, Australia, of overall greenhouse gas trends. "European emissions are creeping up in the post-2000 years." National data submitted to the U.N.'s Climate Change Secretariat show that overall emissions by G8 nations rose 2.0 percent from 2000 to 14.3 billion tonnes in 2005 and were up 0.7 percent since 1990, the base year for the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol. Among G8 nations, Russia, Italy and Canada have all had bigger rises than the 1.6 percent U.S. gain since 2000, when Bush won election to the White House. The revival of the Russian economy after the collapse of the Soviet Union is a main spur. Only Britain, Germany and France have cut back since 2000. Since 1990, however, the United States has had a 16.3 percent rise, second worst behind Canada. All G8 nations back Kyoto except the United States, the biggest world emitter. And Kyoto nations expect falls in emissions in coming years when investments, for instance in energy efficiency or wind or hydro power, will take effect. G8 comparisons for 2005 are possible after Canada and Japan gave data this week. "The main driver for emissions has not been the Kyoto Protocol but how economies have been developing," said Keywan Riahi, a senior researcher at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. Economic growth and rising populations tend to spur emissions from factories, power plants and cars but energy efficiency, partly inspired by Kyoto, and a shift away from heavy industry towards services are among brakes for G8 nations. Among big shifts, Russian emissions are up 7.3 percent since 2000, mainly driven by an economic rebound after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its smokestack industries. But Russia is still 28.7 percent below 1990 levels. Bush said in 2001 that Kyoto would threaten U.S. jobs and wrongly excluded developing nations from first targets of a 5 percent cut by 2008-12. He prefers voluntary agreements and investments in new technologies, such as hydrogen or clean coal. "My personal view is that the importance of Kyoto was not for the actual emissions reductions it may achieve -- which are tiny compared with what is needed -- but rather that Kyoto was a first attempt to build a global consensus and commitment," Raupach said. "In that, it has been less than fully successful," he said. Merkel wants Bush to agree to Kyoto-style caps, with extra urgency after U.N. climate reports this year have said world emissions will need to be cut to help avert more hunger, water shortages, heatwaves and rising seas. The White House said last week that preliminary data showed that U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, fell by 1.3 percent in 2006. "We are effectively confronting the important challenge of global climate change," Bush said. Raupach said, however, that a warm winter contributed to cut U.S. heating demand and a less than scorching 2005 summer had also curbed use of air conditioning. news is provided by Zoom to full size map UN resumes aid to drought-stricken Uganda region EXCLUSIVE-Russia in talks to build gas pipeline to China EXCLUSIVE-Russia in talks to build gas pipeline to China INSTANT VIEW-Reaction to Bush on climate change TABLE-Greenhouse gas cuts needed and G8 pledges so far Catholic Relief Services commends President's call to double PEPFAR funding Source: CRS - USA World Vision Lauds Bush Global AIDS Funding Proposal Source: WV - USA ACT Alert: Indonesia tidal waves displace thousands Source: ACT - Switzerland Put food at the heart of the fight against HIV and Aids or fail, warn leading aid agencies Source: CARE International - UK Catholic Relief Services urges Congress to preserve US long-term development food aid initiatives that fight chronic hunger Source: CRS - USA A drought is seen in a village a year after being flooded by mud in Sidoarjo, in Indonesia's East Java province, May 29, 2007.

She was arrested Feb. 12 while driving away from a fast-food restaurant in Wheaton, 20 miles west of Chicago. Three of her children were inside her 1996 Ford van when someone called police to report a suspected intoxicated driver, authorities have said. Banaszewski refused to take a breath test, resulting in an automatic six-month suspension of her driver's license which she didn't contest in March. A DuPage County judge also sentenced Banaszewski to work 140 hours of public service and attend counseling sessions, according to Paul Darrah, a spokesman for the DuPage County state's attorney's office. Banaszewski's attorney, Donald Ramsell, said the plea agreement was fair to both sides. Scalia, who began serving on the Supreme Court in 1986, has nine children.

Guards at the U.S. Naval Base in southeast Cuba found the detainee in his cell unresponsive and not breathing Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. military&#39;s Southern Command said in a statement. "They tried to save his life, but he was pronounced dead, " said Mario Alvarez, a spokesman for the command. It would be the fourth suicide at Guantanamo since the prison camp opened in January 2002. On June 10, 2006, two Saudi detainees and one Yemeni hanged themselves with sheets. Details, including the prisoner&#39;s name and manner of death, were not released. A spokesman for detention operations, Navy Cmdr. Rick Haupt, declined to comment, referring questions to the Southern Command, based in Miami. The death came as the U.S. military prepared to try two detainees, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni, and Omar Khadr, a Canadian. Their arraignment is scheduled to proceed Monday at Guantanamo as planned, Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon, a Pentagon spokesman, said late Wednesday. Khadr fired his American attorneys on Wednesday, leaving him without defense counsel as his arraignment approaches, his former U.S. military attorney said. "He doesn&#39;t trust American lawyers, and I don&#39;t particularly blame him, " said U.S. Marine Lt. Col. Colby Vokey, who was taken off the case Wednesday. "The United States is responsible for his interrogation and his treatment under a process that is patently unfair." The military toughened security at the prison camp after the previous suicides and an uprising last spring, taking measures to remove access to light fixtures and other possible makeshift weapons. About 380 men are held at the prison camp . The Naval Criminal Investigative Service is conducting an investigation into the three previous suicides.

Putin has issued an acerbic warning to the United States, saying the recent test of a new Russian missile was a direct response to US actions and condemning "imperialism" in world affairs. President Vladimir Putin issued an acerbic warning Friday to the United States, saying the recent test of a new Russian missile was a direct response to US actions and condemning "imperialism" in world affairs. "Our American partners have quit the ABM Treaty," Putin told reporters after meeting his Greek counterpart, referring to the landmark 1972 US-Soviet treaty limiting the missile defenses of the Cold War superpower foes. "We warned them then that we would come out with a response to maintain the strategic balance in the world. Yesterday we conducted a test of a new strategic ballistic missile with multiple warheads, and of a new cruise missile, and will continue to improve our resources." The United States informed Russia in 2001 that it was exercising its option to withdraw unilaterally from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) pact. It has since stepped up controversial plans, fiercely opposed by Russia, to deploy a missile defence shield in eastern Europe. Putin warned Wednesday that the US missile defense plan would turn Europe into a "powder keg" and he repeated on Thursday previous assertions that the planned deployments would ignite a new Cold War-style arms buildup. "We are not the initiators of this new round of the arms race," Putin said. The Russian president's comments came a week before he meets US President George W. Bush and other leaders of the Group of Eight (G8) industrialised nations at a summit in Germany. He is also scheduled to hold one-on-one talks with Bush in the United States at the beginning of July. In a thinly disguised attack on US foreign policy in recent years, Putin warned there had been attempts by actors -- he did not name any country or bloc explicitly -- in international affairs to impose their will on others. "In our view, it is nothing other than diktat, than imperialism," the Russian leader stated. "Problems have arisen because the world changed and there was an attempt to make it unipolar. There was a desire among several international actors to dictate their will to each and everyone and to act not in accordance with the norms of international life and law," Putin said. He added: "This is very dangerous and unhealthy. The norms of international law have been altered for political expediency. What is this political expediency and who defines it?" Tensions between Russia and the United States have risen dramatically in the past year amid sharpening differences over the US missile plans, the state of democracy in Russia and concerns over energy supplies. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice repeated on Wednesday the US assertion that the planned missile defense system in eastern Europe poses no threat to Russia and that Moscow's concern over it is "ludicrous." Her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, countered at a meeting of G8 foreign ministers outside Berlin that "there is nothing ludicrous about this issue because the arms race is starting again."

Bush wants him dead. "Oh, my goodness," White House press secretary Tony Snow said at a news conference when asked about Castro&#039;s comments. Prompted to elaborate on whether the Bush administration is concerned, Snow added: "It&#039;s Fidel Castro." He said nothing more on the subject. The 80-year-old Castro, who has not been seen in public since becoming ill more than 10 months ago, said in an editorial published Tuesday on the front page of the Communist Party daily Granma that Bush was waiting for him to die but could not kill his ideas. "I&#039;m not the first, nor will I be the last, who Bush has ordered to be deprived of life," Castro wrote. Bush urges 15 major countries set global emission goal by 2008 Zoellick has new agenda for World Bank Bush calls on Congress to increase funds for fighting AIDS Called "Reflections of the Commander in Chief," the Cuban leader&#039;s opinion pieces are becoming an almost-daily staple in Granma. Also Tuesday, Castro lambasted Bush for opposing the European Union&#039;s goal for an agreement on carbon emissions at next week&#039;s Group of Eight summit, and criticized both Britain and the United States for heavy military expenditures. Castro shocked Cuba on July 31 when he announced that he had undergone emergency intestinal surgery and was stepping aside provisionally for his younger brother Raul, the defense minister, during his recovery. Although senior Cuban officials have said Castro is on the mend, it seems more unlikely with time that the bearded leader will return to power. In one of his essays earlier this month, Castro offered a few new details about illness, saying that he had numerous operations and that the first procedure did not go well. Castro&#039;s exact ailment and condition remain state secrets, but he is widely believed to suffer from diverticular disease, which causes sacs in the colon that can become inflamed and bleed. Snow&#039;s comments came after U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recently accused Cuba of trying to impose a non-democratic transition of power, and criticized Spain for commercial and economic ties that she said are not helping to bring democracy to the Caribbean island. She said Cuba would be "one of the most important" topics of discussion during a meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luiz Rodriguez Zapatero in Madrid, the last stop on her European tour.

Lee, who served as Taiwanese president from 1988 to 2000, arrived in Japan on Wednesday. He has been a strong critic of Beijing, which claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan more than five decades after the two sides split during a civil war. The mainland has threatened war if the island takes steps to make its de facto independence permanent. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said the purpose of Lee's visit was to push for Taiwanese independence and undermine China-Japan relations. "We express our strong dissatisfaction toward the Japan government for allowing Lee Teng-hui to go to Japan for those activities," Jiang said at a regular news briefing. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stressed that Lee's visit is private and that he did not expect it to hurt Tokyo's relations with Beijing. Ties have been frayed by disputes over exploitation of underwater gas and oil deposits, territory, and interpretation of history, but a visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to Japan in April helped ease their differences. Jiang suggested that support for Taiwan's independence could damage the warming relations. "To properly handle the Taiwan question and historical issues is the basic condition for the healthy development of our bilateral ties," she said. Japan has official diplomatic relations with Beijing, but not with Taiwan. China regularly opposes visits by Taiwanese officials to countries with which it has diplomatic ties. Lee's office has said the 11-day trip will focus on visits to Japanese cultural sites. His itinerary, however, also includes speeches and a news conference. Lee has said he will visit the Yasukuni war shrine, which is vilified by Japan's neighbors, especially China and the Koreas, for symbolizing the country's militaristic past. Lee has a brother enshrined at the Tokyo shrine, which deifies Japan's 2.5 million war dead &mdash; including executed Class-A war criminals &mdash; along with tens of thousands of Koreans and Taiwanese who were drafted into Japan's military.

The 64-year-old, who joins a crowded field of Republican contenders, told newspaper USA Today about his campaign plans, ending months of speculation. He is already well known for his role as a district attorney in TV series Law & Order, and has been polling well. Mr Thompson is expected to launch a "testing the waters" committee in the next few days to start fundraising. The former two-term senator for Tennessee has already been hiring staff, making speeches and setting up a strong internet presence. Reports began circulating on Wednesday that he had decided to make official his informal but already attention-grabbing initiatives towards running for president. "I can't remember exactly the point I said, 'I'm going to do this'," Mr Thompson told USA Today in an interview published on Thursday. "But when I did, that thing that occurred to me: 'I'm going to tell people that I'm thinking about it and see what kind of reaction I get to it'." Mr Thompson has already been attracting attention with speeches He told the paper that his late start to campaigning carried "certain advantages", not least that his use of the internet "has allowed me to be in the hunt, so to speak, without spending a dime". Observers say he could pose a threat to all three of the main contenders for the Republican nomination, Senator John McCain, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Some polls have put him at second or third place among potential Republican voters struggling to decide who to back in a field of almost a dozen candidates. He has strong conservative credentials on issues such as gun control and abortion and, while he voted in 2002 to authorise the Iraq invasion, he is not as closely associated with the war as some of his rivals. His charisma and ability to perform for the crowds are expected to stand him in good stead on the campaign trail. Inevitably, parallels have been drawn between Mr Thompson and another actor-turned-politician, Ronald Reagan. The actor has asked to leave Law & Order, where he has played the astute, fatherly New York District Attorney Arthur Branch for the past five seasons, in order to concentrate on politics. He is also known to viewers for roles in the films The Hunt for Red October, in which he played a US Navy admiral, Last Best Chance and In the Line of Fire.

First Read is updated throughout the day, so check back often. , NBC Political Director , NBC Deputy Political Director Posted: Thursday, May 31, 2007 9:09 AM by Mark Murray The Kansas senator uses the New York Times op-ed page to explain why he was one of three candidates to raise his hand during the first GOP debate to announce that he does not believe in evolution. "The premise behind the question seems to be that if one does not unhesitatingly assert belief in evolution, then one must necessarily believe that God created the world and everything in it in six 24-hour days. But limiting this question to a stark choice between evolution and creationism does a disservice to the complexity of the interaction between science, faith and reasonâ€¦ If belief in evolution means simply assenting to microevolution, small changes over time within a species, I am happy to say, as I have in the past, that I believe it to be true. If, on the other hand, it means assenting to an exclusively materialistic, deterministic vision of the world that holds no place for a guiding intelligence, then I reject it.â€ : â€œIn a potential preview of next fall's presidential contest, Mr. Giuliani, who is seen as the front-runner for the Republican nomination, directly attacked the leading Democratic candidate, Mrs. Clinton, over a speech she gave Tuesday in New Hampshire bemoaning the return of â€˜robber baronsâ€™ and promising to pursue â€˜shared prosperityâ€™ by increasing taxes on Americans making more than $200,000 a year. â€˜This would be an astounding, staggering tax increase,â€™ Mr. Giuliani told reporters yesterday after a visit to a restaurant on the edge of California's Silicon Valley.â€ New York Daily News notes that Giuliani will today pick up an endorsement from former Bill Clinton FBI director Louis Freeh, who has gone from a one-time Clinton advocate to a sharp critic. There was some World Bank fallout for McCain. The nomination of Bob Zoellick means McCain lost his chief policy adviser, Chris Cillizza of WashingtonPost.com In Des Moines yesterday, the former Massachusetts governor came out swinging against the Democratic presidential front-runners' health plans, NBCâ€™s Lauren Appelbaum notes. "I've watched with interest these last few days, watching the Democrats come out with their plans on health care. They don't understand,â€ Romney said. â€œThe path of Europe is not the way to go. Socialized medicine, Hillary-care, Obama-care, they don't get it. The best way to make health care work is to make health care more like a market and with the dynamics of a public market. That's the way to go." (Given that the Democrats have tailored their health plans, in part, on what Romney did in Massachusetts, how do GOP critics view Romney-care?) was also following around Romney this week (in fact, on the same day as our own Matt Lauer). Concludes Klein: "But there isn't the slightest hint of courage or conviction in his stump act. It's a candidacy for the era before 2001, before things got serious. And his success or failure will be a reflection of how serious the electorate is in 2008." interviews the soon-to-be candidate. â€œHis late start carries some problems but also â€˜certain advantages,â€™ he says. â€˜Nobody has maxed out to meâ€™ in contributions, he notes, and using the Internet already â€˜has allowed me to be in the hunt, so to speak, without spending a dime.â€™â€ More: â€œThompson argues that Republicans lost control of the House and Senate in November not because of the war but because of out-of-control spending and unrestrained partisanship. What's surprising â€” and encouraging for Republicans â€” is that Democrats didn't gain more ground, he says. â€˜It's been kind of a pox on both your houses,â€™ he says. â€˜There's a disconnect out there between the people and Washington. â€¦ It seems lately whoever has power, whoever has control makes the same predictable mistakes.â€™â€ By the way, not every GOP strategist believes Thompson is doing this the right way. GOP pollster Tony Fabrizio, who isn't working for any 2008 presidential candidate, tells the he was â€œsurprised and a little sadâ€ that Mr. Thompson had not declared himself a full-fledged candidate. â€œâ€˜Thompson will be competing against three guys who have been running flat out for months and working their tails off for well over a year,â€™ Mr. Fabrizio said. â€˜If youâ€™re not going to get in this race and double-time on work, effort and commitment, how do you expect to win? You need to send signals that say, â€œIâ€™m here and Iâ€™m going to win.â€â€™â€ A Winthrop/ETV poll finds about 40% of South Carolina Republicans believe Thompson should officially enter the presidential race. And Republicans in also have high interest in the former senator. has a little more detail on his schedule for the next month, which includes a "Tonight Show" appearance sometime in June. NBCâ€™s Natalie Morales spoke yesterday with John Gill, special counsel in the district attorneyâ€™s office in Knox County, TN, who happens to be Thompsonâ€™s friend and former law school classmate. Morales asked if he believes Thompson will indeed run for president. "If I had to bet, I would bet that he would,â€ Gill replied. â€œAnd I would bet that he'd announce very soon. He is very popular in Tennessee." puts a dollar figure on what the 100+ donors pledged to raise on the first day of the campaign, June 4 -- $46,000 each. That translates into approximately $4.6 million. Also, all three GOP front-runners disputed analysis that said THEIR campaign was hurt most by Thompson's entry. Said McCain manager Terry Nelson : â€œâ€˜I don't think that it fundamentally changes the strategy of our campaign, which is to put forward John McCain as a candidate ready to lead from Day One.â€™â€ Romney spokesperson Kevin Madden " the notion that Mr. Thompson might peel away conservative and evangelical voters who Mr. Romney has been courting for months." Madden, noting Romney will be speaking in Tennessee on Saturday: â€˜The governor looks at these events as opportunities â€” it could be a Romney crowd by the end of the night,â€™ Mr. Madden said.â€ And Giuliani adviser Tony Carbonetti "played down any concern in the Giuliani campaign that Mr. Thompson would run strongly among voters who are deeply concerned about national security and want a candidate who is socially conservative as well." Here's what Romney said about Thompson in an interview on Iowa's version of Meet the Press -- . â€œâ€˜I'm probably not a good political pundit to know what is going to happen precisely,â€™ Romney said during the taping of an Iowa Public Television show. â€˜I think he'll make the race more interesting. He's got good ideas and after all, he does put bad people in jail every week on â€œLaw and Order.â€â€™â€ The headline in McCain's hometown newspaper, the : "One-Time Ally Is Set To Compete vs. McCain." compete in the straw poll ? More importantly, if he doesn't and Giuliani also punts, then does the straw poll matter?

Someone one tell brownback he is not in KANSAS anymore! If he only had a BRAIN! He has been so far up shrubs butt he is brown ALL over. This bunch should be running FROM the Presdintial race. (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 9:30 AM) Brownback has been brown-nosing his so-called social conservatives for so long, he's lost the ability to discern when his rhetoric touches on the ridiculous. Either that, or he's an idiot. The question was whether you believe in evolution... and had nothing to do with what forces might be causing evolution. Like I keep telling my eight-year-old, who had a rough go in third grade this year... answer the question that's asked. But my son has an excuse. He's only eight. What's Brownback's excuse? Paul Miller, Woodbridge, VA (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 9:31 AM) So Brownback believes in...? The Creation of Evolution? The Evolution of Creationism? Creative Evoultion? Evolving Creationism?

Steve Turner Cedar Falls Iowa (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 9:54 AM) Brownback realizes how incredibly stupid it appears to not acknowledge evolution of our earth, when the evidence is spread throughout the planet.

Bush is also a believer in this kind of hogwash. The ten clones of Bush running for his job are precisely what America does not need, after the debacle of the Bush Regime has ended. The pathetic attempts of Brownback, to backpedal and attempt to paint himself as less than a religious zealot, are wholly unsuccessful. Run from this guy (and the other 9 who are virtually indistinguishable from one another....and more to the point, are copies of George W. Bush). Coy Reese, Shady Spring, West Virgina (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 10:26 AM) If his hand was up for the evolution question, do America a favor and vote for one of the other guys. Enough with this stupidity. We have a hard enough time maintaining world respect without this constant annoying and false "debate" overshadowing science. Evolution, however you want to say it was directed to adhere to your faith, happened. Don't be an idiot. Stop making us look like idiots. (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 11:07 AM) That would be impossible Andrew. So many idiots we have no choices. God must love idiots, he made so many of them.

VOA national correspondent Jim Malone has more from Washington. Republican presidential hopefuls former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, left, embraces former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as Senator John McCain walks by after the Republican debate, 15 May 2007 In the latest debate held in South Carolina and televised by the Fox News Channel, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani may have helped himself with a statement on the 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. Giuliani responded to a comment from Texas Congressman Ron Paul about the roots of the 9/11 attacks. Paul is the only Republican candidate who opposes the war in Iraq. "They attack us because we have been over there. We have been bombing Iraq for 10 years. We have been in the Middle East. I think [former President Ronald] Reagan was right. We do not understand the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics." "That is an extraordinary statement. As someone who lived through the attack of September 11th, [to say that] we invited the attack, because we were attacking Iraq, I do not think I have ever heard that before. And I have heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th." There were other examples of a more aggressive tone among the Republican contenders. Arizona Senator John McCain was asked about his opposition to torture in the questioning of terrorism suspects and his vow to close the terrorist detention camp at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. "The use of torture, as much as we would gain from torture, we would lose in world opinion," said Senator McCain. "We do not torture people." Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney also opposed the use of torture to obtain information about an impending terrorist attack. But Romney said he would favor keeping the Guantanamo Bay prison open and doubling the number of terrorist suspects held there. Former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore said some of the frontrunners in the Republican field are trying to portray themselves as more conservative than they actually are. Gilmore cited Giuliani's support for abortion rights and the fact that Romney was once a supporter of abortion, but now opposes it. Gilmore also noted that McCain initially opposed President Bush's tax cut program. Gilmore also repeated concerns about Iran that several of the Republican contenders expressed in their earlier debate in California. "There is no choice at this point other than to join up with people across the world in order to put on serious, mandatory sanctions against Iran," he said. Another of the lesser known Republican contenders, Colorado Congressman Tom Tancredo, accused Giuliani, McCain and Romney of being weak on the issue of stopping illegal immigration into the U.S. University of Virginia political analyst Larry Sabato said the second Republican debate demonstrated a new willingness on the part of several candidates to challenge each other. "They have not been attacking one another until tonight, and this time they decided to unsheathe the short knives," he said. "They went after each other, at least a bit and they drew some blood. I think McCain was bleeding a bit, I think Romney was bleeding a bit. Some of the minor candidates [as well], but they do not matter." Public-opinion polls show Giuliani in the lead for the Republican nomination, followed by McCain and Romney, with the seven other active candidates trailing far behind. But the polls also show support for two Republicans who are considering a White House run, but who have not declared their candidacies, former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia. Craig Crawford of Congressional Quarterly magazine says none of the Republican candidates has yet captured the imagination of the party's social conservative wing, a crucial constituency in the nominating process. "I think one of the biggest reasons the Republican race is wide open is that no one has a claim on the conservative chair, the social conservative chair in the Republican Party," he explained. Thompson is expected to decide whether to enter the race in the next few weeks while Gingrich says he will make a decision by September.

Meanwhile, US forces backed by helicopter gunship clashed with suspected Al-Qaeda gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. At least 10 policemen were among the dead in the Fallujah attack, which occurred about 11 am, according to police officials. Fallujah, in restive Anbar province, is 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated his explosives vest at the third of four checkpoints as he stood among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only been opened on Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The US military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of tribes that have banded together to fight Al-Qaeda. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of insurgents and Al-Qaeda through the course of the Iraq war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents there called for US help. Members of Al-Qaeda were preventing students from attending final examinations, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. Clashes continued into Thursday afternoon, and the council official said the Al-Qaeda leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the US military. US forces, meanwhile, pressed on Thursday with the search for five kidnapped Britons. A procession of mourners marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a US helicopter strike before dawn. The US military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the attack. It came in the second day of a search for the Britons who were abducted from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad on Tuesday. A US military statement, however, said US forces had arrested two members of a secret cell network on Thursday in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. A police officer in Sadr City said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 am, killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was injured. Also in Sadr City raids, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi said his home was raided and ransacked by US forces at 3 am Thursday. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. The Britons were snatched from a Finance Ministry facility in a mock police raid. The US military late Wednesday reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed in a roadside bombing and one who died of a non-combat cause. Their deaths rose to 119 the number of soldiers killed this month, the third-deadliest month of the war for US troops. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. An Al-Qaeda front group has claimed responsibility. Residents gather near a burnt vehicle after an airstrike by US forces in Baghdad's Sadr City.

Security has been tightened in Bangkok amid fears that supporters of ousted Premier Thaksin Shinawatra may react violently ahead of a tribunal ruling that may disband the country's two largest parties. The constitutional court is due to rule on Wednesday, May 30, 2007 whether the Thai Rak Thai Party of former Prime Minister Thaksin, and its Democrat Party rival, violated election laws in April last year. If found guilty, either or both parties could be dissolved, or their executives barred from public office for five years, or both. (AP Photo/Apichart Weerawong) BANGKOK, Thailand - A court ruled Wednesday that the country's oldest political party was not guilty of maligning ousted Premier Thaksin Shinawatra and urging voters to cast a "no" vote in last year's election. The ruling was the first of six charges the Constitutional Tribunal is considering against the Democrat Party. It then will consider similar election law violations against Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party. A guilty finding could result in either the parties or their executives being banned from politics. The party is "not guilty of maligning Thaksin's party Thak Rak Thai and persuading people to vote no," a judge read out to the crowded courtroom. "It did not mislead voters about Thaksin's popularity as the election commission alleged."

Security Council and freeze uranium enrichment, saying Washington was ready for wide-ranging talks if it complied. "I think it&#039;s time for Iran to change its tactics," Rice told reporters in Vienna, Austria, where she was attending a conference on the role of women in the Middle East. If Iran does so, she said, "then we are prepared to ... sit with Iran and talk about whatever Iran would like to talk about. "But that can&#039;t be done when Iran continues to pursue, to try to perfect technologies that are going to lead to a nuclear weapon," Rice said, alluding to U.S. assertion that Tehran was seeking the cover of a peaceful nuclear program to make such arms. With both sides voicing hardline positions, the talks on Thursday between ranking Iranian nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani and Javier Solana, the EU&#039;s senior foreign policy representative, were unlikely to make substantial headway. Diplomats told The Associated Press that, although Tehran recently suggested it was ready to discuss a partial suspension of uranium enrichment, the West rejected the overture and Iran has withdrawn its offer to break the nuclear impasse. Russian denies involvement in Litvinenko killing Bicycle programs catching on in major cities Europe leads in designing buildings that save energy "Suspension is not the right solution for solving Iran&#039;s nuclear issue," the Iranian state news agency quoted Larijani as saying before leaving for Spain. On arrival in Madrid on Wednesday, he obliquely blamed the U.S. and its Western allies for their insistence on a full freeze, referring to "some mischievous moves by some countries." In Vienna, Rice said Iran had no option but to "suspend, to demonstrate that it is in fact not seeking a nuclear weapon under cover of (a) civil nuclear power" program. "The question isn&#039;t why won&#039;t we talk to Tehran, the question is why doesn&#039;t Tehran want to talk to us," she said, when asked whether it was time for Washington to rethink its insistence on full suspension. A year ago, she reached out dramatically to longtime adversary Iran with an offer to talk "anytime, any place," which was intended to inject new life into an ebbing European diplomatic effort to turn back Iran&#039;s advancing nuclear program. Iran did not accept Rice&#039;s offer for the first Cabinet-level direct talks in nearly three decades, because of the condition to stop enriching uranium. There is a growing perception among some European nations that the five permanent U.N. Security Council nations plus Germany &#8212; the powers in the forefront of attempts to engage Iran &#8212; should drop their full suspension precondition to talks starting on a package of incentives. At talks last month in Ankara, Turkey, both Larijani and Solana agreed to meet again to try to bridge the divide between Iran&#039;s insistence on its right to enrich and Security Council demands for a freeze. Before that meeting, Iran suggested it was ready to stop some of its centrifuge machines, which can enrich uranium to the low level used to generate power and to high-grade material used in the fissile core of nuclear warheads, said one of the diplomats, who demanded anonymity for revealing confidential information. But the U.S. and Security Council allies Britain and France continued to insist on full suspension, and another diplomat said that at the Ankara meeting, Larijani suddenly changed tack, saying Iran was no longer interested in a partial and temporary suspension. "It was clear that those on the Western side did not accept any centrifuges (running) at all," said the first diplomat. "As a result, the Iranians have gone completely hardline." Diplomats said evidence of that surfaced at a meeting Friday in Brussels between Larijani&#039;s deputy, Javed Vaidi, and senior civil servants of Britain, France and Germany who report directly to their foreign ministers. Also present was a senior Solana aide. "It was a disaster," said the first diplomat, adding the two sides parted with no signs of progress on the issue. Although Iran insists it has the right to the technology to generate nuclear power, it has been hit with two sets of U.N. sanctions because of suspicions bred by nearly two decades of Tehran&#039;s clandestine nuclear activities. Rice, in Vienna, said that while the Security Council stood ready to freeze further punitive actions, "Iran has not been willing to take the other half of that bargain" by agreeing to a full suspension of enrichment. Iran&#039;s ultimate stated goal is running 54,000 centrifuges to churn out enriched uranium. That would be enough for dozens of nuclear warheads a year.

Market Sensitive Global News Suicide Bombing At Police Recruitment Center Kills At Least 20 Iraqis [] 5/31/2007 8:10:18 AM A suicide bomber wearing an explosives vest attacked a police recruitment centre in the Iraqi city of Falluja, killing at least 20 people and wounding dozens, Iraqi police said on Thursday. Police said the bomber had passed through several checkpoints before detonating the device among a crowd of police recruits. Following co-operation between US and Iraqi forces and a grouping of Sunni Arab tribes called the Anbar Salvation Council, the police recruitment centre had only opened on Saturday. The Sunni Arab tribes had come together last year in an attempt to fight al-Qaeda elements in Anbar province. Falluja which lies west of Baghdad in Anbar province, an area that has seen some of the fiercest fighting between US and Iraqi forces and Sunni Arab insurgents is one of the key battlegrounds in the insurgency. No Breakthrough As Search Goes On For Abducted Britons In Iraq [] 5/31/2007 4:23:43 AM There has been no breakthrough in the efforts to trace five Britons abducted by suspected radical Shiite Mahdi Army militia from the heavily guarded Iraqi Finance Ministry complex in the Sadr City suburb on Tuesday. Speaking at the G8 summit in Berlin, Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said the situation remained "quite unclear", but reiterated that "everything possible" was being done to secure their release and families of the abducted men were being kept informed of any progress. Among those seized were a business consultant and his four bodyguards. The abduction is suspected to be in retaliation for the killing by British forces last week of the militia's commander in Basra. On Wednesday, US and Iraqi troops cordoned off parts of the city close to where the kidnapping occurred and carried out raids. Though the US military said that some militants were arrested, it did not confirm whether the raids were related to the abducted Britons.

Mr Putin said it was a "response to maintain the strategic balance in the world", in what he called a "new round of the arms race". He added that Russia would continue to improve its resources. Russia tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile, which can be armed with up to 10 warheads, on Tuesday. These actions by Russia should not be feared, they are not aggressive Europe diary: Missile defence "Our American partners have left the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty," Mr Putin told a press conference. "We have warned them then that we will come out with a response to maintain the strategic balance in the world." Mr Putin defended Russia's actions, insisting they were not the "initiators of this new round of the arms race". "(Our partners) are stuffing Eastern Europe with new weapons," he said. "A new base in Bulgaria, another in Romania, a site in Poland, radar in the Czech Republic. What are we supposed to do? We cannot just observe all this." He added: "These actions by Russia should not be feared, they are not aggressive, it's just an answer to rather tough and unjustified unilateral actions by partners." Washington wants to deploy interceptor rockets in Poland and a radar base in the Czech Republic to counter what it describes as a potential threat from "rogue states" such as Iran and North Korea. The US maintains its system is not directed at the Russians, but Moscow says its security is being threatened. Russia's test launch took place at the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia on 29 May. The missile, called RS-24, was designed to evade missile defence systems, the Russian defence ministry says. The test missile successfully struck its target 5,500km (3,400 miles) away on the far eastern Kamchatka peninsula, the Russian Strategic Missile Forces said.

Senior officials Thursday morning attended an urgent meeting called by Bangkok police chief Pol. Lt-Gen. Adisorn Nonsi after learning that members and supporters of the disbanded TRT planned to organize a major demonstration after the party was disbanded by the Constitution Tribunal late Wednesday, according to the Thai News Agency. Thai Rak Thai and three small political parties were dissolved by the ruling of the Constitution Tribunal after being found guilty of electoral fraud in the April 2, 2006 general election which was later declared null and void. The TRT party's 111 executives were banned from politics for five years. Security personnel manning the checkpoints established in areas served by the capital's 88 police stations will question suspicious private vehicle drivers and passengers, as well as taxi and motorcycle taxi drivers, after police received intelligence reports that members and supporters of TRT planned to rally Thursday afternoon.

Turkish soldiers stand guard at a checkpoint near the southeast Turkish town of Cizre, some 60 km (37 miles) from Turkey's Habur border gate to Iraq, May 29, 2007. [Reuters] A group of 20 tanks loaded on trucks emerged from army barracks in Mardin near Syria and headed towards the Iraqi border in southeast Turkey, already the scene of a major army offensive against rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Speculation about an imminent incursion into Iraq has grown since Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said last week he saw eye to eye with the army over possible military action, despite unease in the United States, Turkey's NATO ally, about such a move. There was also anxiety along the border in southeast Turkey, where many Kurdish villagers form part of a state-backed militia which fights alongside the army against the PKK rebels. "We support the operations in the mountains here because the PKK made us suffer a lot. I lost 10 people from my family," said Nadir Karadeniz, an official in the village of Gorumlu, located near a military base just a few kilometers from the border. But there was reluctance to take the fight into the Iraqi mountains, where thousands of PKK fighters are based, given the strong opposition from Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani - a respected figure among Turkey's own Kurds. "I don't think it would be good to go into northern Iraq because Barzani said he would not accept Turkish soldiers there," Karadeniz said, before a military jeep arrived in the village and told journalists to leave the area. Military operations are currently focused on the rebels already inside Turkish territory. Security forces killed 10 PKK fighters in clashes across the southeast on Tuesday. The United States has repeatedly urged Turkey not to send troops into Iraq because it says it will only complicate the situation. The two countries have agreed various measures, including financial ones, to try to curb the PKK.

The U.S. military said only one policeman was killed and eight were wounded. U.S. forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al-Qaida gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. The American military also reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed Wednesday in a roadside bombing in Baghdad and one who died of wounds from a roadside bomb attack northwest of the capital Tuesday. At least 122 American forces have died in May, the third-deadliest month of the Iraq conflict. U.S. forces also continued a search for five Britons who were kidnapped Tuesday in Baghdad, as well as for two of its soldiers who have been missing since a May 12 ambush south of the capital. The Fallujah suicide bomber killed at least 10 policemen in the attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. The rest of the dead were civilians, many of them in line seeking jobs as policemen. He said as many as 50 were wounded. Fallujah General Hospital had received 15 bodies and 10 wounded, according to a doctor there, who would not allow the use of his name because he feared retribution. The physician said he believed other casualties were taken to the nearby Jordanian Hospital and private clinics. A member of the Fallujah city council, who also asked for anonymity for fear of attack by insurgents, said there were at least 20 killed and 25 injured. The coordination of information in Fallujah was particularly difficult because the mobile telephone system has been working only sporadically. Maj. Jeff Pool of the Multi-National Force-West said the Anbar province governor's office and the provincial police put the total number of dead at one Iraqi policeman, with six police and two civilians wounded in Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated explosives in his vest at the third of four checkpoints, standing among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only opened Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The U.S. military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaida. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of Sunni insurgents and al-Qaida throughout the war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents called for U.S. help. Members of al-Qaida, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final exams, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from al-Qaida. Clashes continued into the afternoon, and the council official said the al-Qaida leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the U.S. military. U.S. forces, meanwhile, pressed on with the search for five kidnapped Britons, and a procession of mourners, some of them women wailing and beating their chests, marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a U.S. helicopter strike before dawn. The U.S. military said it had no report of airstrikes in Sadr City and that there were no civilian casualties in the second day of a search for the Britons, who were abducted Tuesday from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad. A U.S. military statement, however, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. AP Television News videotape from Sadr City showed the coffins of the victims atop a small bus with men and women walking behind, crying. A young boy could be seen sitting next to the coffins. A car in the area was punctured with big holes, as if hit by an airstrike. A police officer in Sadr City, who refused to allow use of his name because he feared retribution, said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 a.m., killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home , a common practice in Iraq's extreme heat through late spring and summer. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was wounded. Also in Sadr City raids, which the U.S. has been conducting with a select unit of Iraqi army forces, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi claimed his home was raided and ransacked by American forces at 3 a.m. Thursday. The military said it had no report of the incident. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. Dozens of U.S. Humvees and Bradley fighting vehicles had taken up positions around Sadr City at nightfall Wednesday. The five kidnapped Britons included four bodyguards working for the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld and one employee of BearingPoint, a U.S.-based management consulting firm. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. The Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, claimed responsibility. Wiggins also said that more than 100 patrols a day were being launched to search for two missing troops who vanished after a May 12 ambush near Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. Four Americans and one Iraqi soldier were killed in the attack and the body of another American was later found in the Euphrates River. "Our determination and resolve to locate our missing soldiers is unwavering," Wiggins said.

George was an aboriginal protester shot and killed by Ontario police at Ipperwash Provincial Park in 1995 when police moved in to break up a land-claim protest. A provincial inquiry was held and commissioner Sidney Linden's report is expected to conclude whether or not former Ontario premier Mike Harris influenced the police response. The report is also expected to offer sugestions on how to avoid bloodshed in similar occupations in the future. - AM 640 Toronto 24 Hour Newscentre Ipperwash Inquiry Blames ex-Premier and Police for Death of Protester Offer on the Table For Six Nations Public Health Hoping E-Cards will Stem STD's Mt.

US Willing To Enter Into Dialogue With Tehran [] 5/31/2007 6:02:53 AM Despite Tehran reiterating a number of times that it will not enter into any talks with preconditions and that it will not halt its nuclear enrichment, the US said on Thursday that Washington was ready to change its 27 years of US policy to start "wide-ranging" talks if Tehran agreed to heed to UN Security Council and suspend uranium enrichment. Speaking on the sidelines of an international women's empowerment conference in Vienna, before nuclear talks between senior Iranian and EU negotiators, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said it was time for "Iran to change its tactics." If Iran does so, she said, "then we are prepared to ... sit with Iran and talk about whatever Iran would like to talk about." "The question is not, why we don't talk to Iran but why Iran does not talk to us," Rice said. She insisted Iran had to suspend uranium enrichment before sanctions imposed UN Security Council could be lifted. South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary Proposal Defeated At IWC Meeting [] 5/31/2007 4:03:57 AM Latin American proposals for a South Atlantic whale sanctuary, which would have ensured whale protection extended northwards from the existing Southern Ocean sanctuary, have been defeated in the first vote at the International Whaling Commission's meeting at Alaska this year. Delegates at the meeting supported the proposal by a margin of 39 to 29, which however fell short of the three-quarters majority required. Japan, Norway, Denmark and many Caribbean and African countries voted against the proposal. Latin American countries who have been trying to establish a sanctuary in the south Atlantic have expressed their disappointment at the vote. Argentina's whaling commissioner Eduardo Iglesias said: "We are very sad because we are trying to emphasize the needs of many coastal communities in Brazil, in Uruguay, Argentina, even South Africa, but they are not respected here with this decision." Meanwhile, Denmark has scaled down a controversial plan to boost subsistence whaling by Greenland Inuits while a discussion on Japan's plans for limited commercial hunting will continue which would see Japanese coastal communities allowed to hunt a small minke whale each year, with the meat being sold locally. However, anti-whaling countries view the proposal as a breach of the 21-year moratorium on commercial whaling.

Fred Thompson of Tennessee is about to take a big step toward a formal presidential campaign, a move that will shake up the unsettled Republican field and throw a wild card into the competition for the GOP's conservative core. This week, Thompson asked supporters to begin collecting campaign donations on June 4, after he files papers with the Federal Election Commission to establish a political committee to "test the waters" for a White House bid. The move is the clearest signal to date that Thompson, best-known for playing a gruff district attorney on Law & Order, is shelving his reluctance to join the race. He has been urged by friends and conservatives to run and fill a perceived void on the right flank of the Republican candidate field. After weighing a bid for months, Thompson announced in a Tuesday conference call with about 75 potential donors that he was about to establish his formal fundraising committee, Friends of Fred Thompson. Donors listening in on the call, dubbed the "first-day founders," were encouraged to raise about $50,000 each. Thompson has been keeping a high profile in conservative circles and preparing behind the scenes to launch a campaign. He has gathered a cadre of senior advisers that includes Ken Rietz, a former political director of the Republican National Committee; and Michael Toner, former chairman of the FEC. On Saturday, he will speak at a major Republican Party event in Virginia known as the Commonwealth Gala. He addressed a conservative group in Orange County, Calif., in early May, but his speech was panned by some conservative commentators as lackluster.

David Ramsay, Minister of Natural Resources and Aboriginal Affairs, announced the formation of an Ipperwash response team to implement the recommendations of Commissioner Sidney Linden in his inquiry report released Thursday. Mr. Ramsay said this was a &ldquo;turning point&rdquo; for the province, which will benefit all Ontarians. &ldquo;The message is clear. Only by working together can we achieve the common goal of prosperity and equal opportunity for Aboriginal people across this province,&rdquo; Mr. Ramsay said. Sept. 7, 1995. A spray painted sign at Ipperwash Provincial Park reflects Natives' anger about the 1995 confrontation that left protester Anthony O'Brien (Dudley) George dead. (The Globe and Mail) Sam George comments on findings Dudley George's brother speaks with reporters following the release of Thursday's report Inquiry Commissioner Sidney Linden speaks Inquiry Commissioner speaks with reporters from Forest, Ont. Report a road map to unity, peace, aboriginal leaders say Murray Klippenstein on the Ipperwash Inquiry Report Bob Runciman on the Ipperwash Inquiry Report Storm of scandal to finally clear In the 1433-page report, Commissioner Linden offered a scathing review of Ontario Provincial Police operations on the night 38-year-old Dudley George was shot at Ipperwash Provincial Park. He apportions blame to federal and provincial governments as well as the OPP for the stand-off, and makes 98 recommendations that he hopes will help all peoples reach a path of healing. Minutes before the provincial apology, Dudley George's older brother Sam said he was hoping for an apology from Mike Harris, who was Premier at the time. Failing that, he said it was fitting for the province to apologize for him. &ldquo;What Mr. Harris did was act too fast, and closed off many options including negotiations, communications,&rdquo; Mr. George said. &ldquo;We hold him partially responsible for what happened, because of that acting too fast. &ldquo;We wonder if it might be appropriate at this time for Mr. Harris to apologize to my family, or maybe, if Mr. Harris chooses not to, for the government of Ontario to do so. Maybe that is not too much to ask.&rdquo; But Peter Donard, lawyer for Mr. Harris, immediately rejected calls for an apology. &ldquo;This commissioner has made it clear that no apology is required,&rdquo; Mr. Donard said in a testy exchange with reporters. &ldquo;As far as Mr. Harris is concerned, this commission has found specifically in the report that there's no evidence to suggest that either Premier Harris or any member of his government is responsible for the death of Dudley George.&rdquo; Prime among the report recommendations is a call to establish a stand-alone Aboriginal Affairs Ministry within the provincial cabinet, with adequate resources, and for the Federal Government to publicly apologize to the people of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation for failing to honour its promise to return its land. He also urged the creation of a treaty commission of Ontario to settle land and treaty claims, an Aboriginal Reconciliation Fund, more federal involvement with land claim disputes, and new regulations under the Police Services Act to ensure all government directions are in writing and made public to the Commissioner. Judge Linden calls for the OPP to make a public apology to Cecil Bergard George for the beating he sustained in the parking lot where Mr. George was fatally shot by police officer Ken Deane. But in his report, Judge Linden says the matter goes well beyond Mr. Deane and the Inspector who sent him in at 11 p.m. along with a riot squad and other specialist officers. The OPP as an institution also needs to be accountable and share responsibility for the tragedy, as does the Federal Government, he says. &ldquo;Unfortunately, the issues that were at the heart of the Ipperwash occupation remain unresolved by the federal government to this day. This inexcusable delay and long neglect, by successive federal governments, are at the heart of the Ipperwash story.&rdquo; Politically, the hotbed that was Queens Park after the 1995 election played a substantial role in proceedings by Lake Huron that night. Judge Linden found that Premier Mike Harris or someone in his office did convene a meeting on the evening of Sept. 6, 1995, commonly referred to as &ldquo;the dining room meeting&rdquo;. While he found that Mr. Harris did make the controversial comment that he &ldquo;wanted the fucking Indians out of the park&rdquo;, he questions exactly when that comment was made. It was Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson who said the same phrase the &ldquo;dining room meeting&rdquo;, Judge Linden said. The report also finds that Mr. Harris knew at least one person at the meeting was a seconded OPP officer, and that by the end of the meeting &ldquo;Premier Harris had made it clear he wanted the occupiers out of the park as quickly as possible.&rdquo; The Premier's comments in the dining room, and the speed at which he wanted a resolution, &ldquo;unduly narrowed the scope of the government's response&rdquo; and &ldquo;closed off many options endorsed by civil servants,&rdquo; Judge Linden said. And the Premier's push to have an immediate injunction and to remove the Indians from the park within 24 hours was inappropriate. &ldquo;It is for the police to decide whether and when arrests will be made.&rdquo; All of that &ldquo;created the risk of placing political pressure on the police&rdquo; when, in contrast, &ldquo;the Premier could have urged patience, rather than speed&rdquo;. But he concluded that the sum of those factors did not equate to political interference. &ldquo;In my view, although Premier Harris was critical of the police, I do not find that he interfered with or gave inappropriate directions to the police at Ipperwash,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;The Premier did not inappropriately direct the OPP on its operations at Ipperwash or enter the law enforcement domain of the police.&rdquo; The Commissioner confirms that the natives were unarmed, and that Premier Harris and Attorney-General Charles Harnick misled the legislature about the &ldquo;dining room meeting&rdquo;. Julian Falconer, the lawyer representing Aboriginal Legal Services at the inquiry, said the report was &ldquo;historical&rdquo; in that Judge Linden rejected some of Mr. Harris' testimony. &ldquo;It is absolutely unprecedented for a commissioner to make a finding that expressly finds that both the premier and the attorney general misled the house about the key dining room meeting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is a startling revelation and it is unprecedented that I know of for a commissioner to reject evidence under oath by a then premier.&rdquo; The actions of the Ontario Provincial Police were viewed scathingly by Judge Linden, whose references to &ldquo;critical failures&rdquo; on the night of Dudley George's shooting are wearyingly regular. Negotiators should have been called in first. Crowd Management Unit should not have been deployed at night. And, most importantly, the protesters should have been told that they were safe inside the fence. The police had no intention of entering the park. &ldquo;The CMU were busy yelling commands to each other when the officers should have been yelling these crucial messages to the Aboriginal people,&rdquo; Judge Linden wrote. Ontario Provincial Police lawyer Mark Sandler said the Ipperwash standoff was a catalyst for significant change within the force and that the OPP is one of the most progressive police services in the world in terms of aboriginal issues and policies. &ldquo;The OPP came to this inquiry a very different police force than it was 12 years ago,&rdquo; Mr. Sandler said. Judge Linden's criticisms hit upon many of the people mentioned during the Inquiry hearings, including the Premier's executive assistant Deb Hutton. &ldquo;Neither Deb Hutton nor Michael Harris fully appreciated at that time the power of the Premier and the Premier's office,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Regrettably, Ms. Hutton had little experience in aboriginal issues, nor did she have a sound understanding of Aboriginal culture, section 35 of the Constitution, or concepts such as colour of right.&rdquo; In response to the report, Ms. Hutton said the findings &ldquo;conclusively set to rest the unfounded allegations&rdquo; made since Dudley George's death. &ldquo;Commissioner Linden has made clear in his report that there was no political direction of the OPP,&rdquo; she said in a statement issued by her lawyer. As for the land itself, the Commissioner said allowing the status quo to continue is not in anyone's interest. Among the possibilities they could consider, he says, is the reopening of Ipperwash Park under the management of the Kettle Point and Stony Point communities, &ldquo;for the benefit of all Ontarians and visitors alike.&rdquo; On the question of reopening the park, Mr. Ramsay told reporters Thursday: &ldquo;That is not something I've been contemplating, so let's just leave it at that,&rdquo; Mr. Ramsay said.

Moczulski By Alister Doyle, Environment Correspondent OSLO (Reuters) - Greenhouse gas emissions by leading industrialised nations have accelerated since 2000 and several countries are performing worse than the United States which opposes a U.N. pact for curbing global warming, U.N. data shows. Leaders of the Group of Eight rich nations meet in Germany next week with President George W. Bush resisting pressure by German Chancellor Angela Merkel to agree to cap emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels. But Bush is not alone in presiding over rising emissions. ADVERTISEMENT (article continues below) "Growth rates ... of emissions in the U.S. are slowing," said Michael Raupach, of the Earth Observation Centre in Canberra, Australia, of overall greenhouse gas trends. "European emissions are creeping up in the post-2000 years." National data submitted to the U.N.'s Climate Change Secretariat show that overall emissions by G8 nations rose 2.0 percent from 2000 to 14.3 billion tonnes in 2005 and were up 0.7 percent since 1990, the base year for the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol. Among G8 nations, Russia, Italy and Canada have all had bigger rises than the 1.6 percent U.S. gain since 2000, when Bush won election to the White House. The revival of the Russian economy after the collapse of the Soviet Union is a main spur. Only Britain, Germany and France have cut back since 2000. Since 1990, however, the United States has had a 16.3 percent rise, second worst behind Canada. All G8 nations back Kyoto except the United States, the biggest world emitter. And Kyoto nations expect falls in emissions in coming years when investments, for instance in energy efficiency or wind or hydro power, will take effect. G8 comparisons for 2005 are possible after Canada and Japan gave data this week. "The main driver for emissions has not been the Kyoto Protocol but how economies have been developing," said Keywan Riahi, a senior researcher at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. Economic growth and rising populations tend to spur emissions from factories, power plants and cars but energy efficiency, partly inspired by Kyoto, and a shift away from heavy industry towards services are among brakes for G8 nations. Among big shifts, Russian emissions are up 7.3 percent since 2000, mainly driven by an economic rebound after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its smokestack industries. But Russia is still 28.7 percent below 1990 levels. Bush said in 2001 that Kyoto would threaten U.S. jobs and wrongly excluded developing nations from first targets of a 5 percent cut by 2008-12. He prefers voluntary agreements and investments in new technologies, such as hydrogen or clean coal. "My personal view is that the importance of Kyoto was not for the actual emissions reductions it may achieve -- which are tiny compared with what is needed -- but rather that Kyoto was a first attempt to build a global consensus and commitment," Raupach said. "In that, it has been less than fully successful," he said. Merkel wants Bush to agree to Kyoto-style caps, with extra urgency after U.N. climate reports this year have said world emissions will need to be cut to help avert more hunger, water shortages, heatwaves and rising seas. The White House said last week that preliminary data showed that U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, fell by 1.3 percent in 2006. "We are effectively confronting the important challenge of global climate change," Bush said. Raupach said, however, that a warm winter contributed to cut U.S. heating demand and a less than scorching 2005 summer had also curbed use of air conditioning.

ACLU sues Jeppesen over CIA flights The Denver Business Journal - 2:45 PM MDT Wednesday, May 30, 2007 American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday against Jeppesen DataPlan Inc. of San Jose, Calif., on behalf of alleged victims of U.S. government torture. Jeppesen DataPlan is part of aviation-data provider of Colorado. Based in Englewood, Jeppesen Sanderson is a subsidiary of aircraft manufacturer The ACLU alleges in its suit, filed in Northern California federal court, that Jeppesen knowingly provided flight services to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) , which enabled the secret transport of three terrorism suspects to overseas locations for interrogation and torture. The terrorism suspects are Binyam Mohamed of Ethiopia, Italian citizen Abou Elkassim Britel and Ahmed Agiza of Egypt. The suit contends Jeppesen -- through its international trip and flight-planning operation in San Jose -- "has been a main provider of flight and logistical support services for aircraft used by the CIA ...," according to an ACLU statement. Mike Pound, a Jeppesen Sanderson spokesman, was unavailable for comment this afternoon. But earlier today, Pound told CBS News that Jeppesen officials had no comment about the suit because they hadn't seen it yet. Pound did tell the television network that Jeppesen doesn't know the purpose of customers' flights. "We create flight plans, what the fuel requirements might be, where they might refuel, the airports they might use ... It's not our practice to ever inquire about the purpose of a trip," Pound told CBS. Anthony Romero, the ACLU's executive director, chastised American companies that allegedly profit from the U.S. government's so-called "extraordinary rendition" program, which allows the CIA to transport terrorism suspects outside this country. "Corporations that choose to participate in such activity can and should be held legally accountable," Romero said in a statement. Further allegations in the suit include: Mohamed was flown to Morocco in 2002 where he was interrogated and tortured for 18 months. He later was taken to Kabul, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where he remains. Britel was flown from Pakistan to Morocco and tortured there. He's still in Morocco. Agiza was flown from Sweden to Egypt, where he was tortured and otherwise abused. He remains in Egypt. The ACLU filed suit under this country's Alien Tort Statue, which allows aliens to bring legal claims in the United States. Jeppesen Sanderson employs 3,000 people around the world -- 1,250 of them in Colorado. The company serves 85 percent of the world's airlines with navigational data, flight planning and operations solutions.

Lee said he wanted to visit the war-related shrine because his elder brother is memorialized there. The brother was killed in World War II while fighting for Japan. Taiwan at the time was a Japanese colony. "I don't know if I have time to pay a visit," Lee told Japanese reporters aboard the flight from Taipei to Tokyo. "But because my brother is enshrined there, I would be sorry if I cannot make it as a brother." Lee visited Japan in 2001 and 2004, but Wednesday's visit to Tokyo is his first to the capital in 22 years. "I was surprised to find that Tokyo Bay has become so clear," Lee said at the capital's Odaiba waterfront district. Lee, 84, said his visit to Japan was "not for political activities," which would antagonize Beijing. He has no plans to meet with politicians here during his stay through June 9.(IHT/Asahi: May 31,2007) 'Rightist' gets 8-year term for setting fire to Kato's home No redress for illegal actions during war Death sentence upheld for Aum Shinrikyo chemist Survey: 1,222 school pools have safety deficiencies Mother strangles daughter, fails in suicide attempt Anti-graft cop held in bid-rigging case Matsushita issues massive recall TOKYO: Lee Tenghui weighs Yasukuni visit ELECTRONICS: Victor president to step down in June Hungry For Words (e-Learning) Bilingual Vox Populi, Vox Dei Asahi Shimbun English-language Publication The Asahi Shimbun Asia Network Up-to-date columns and reports on pressing issues indispensable for mutual understanding in Asia.

The New York-based rights group said it would file a suit against Jeppesen Dataplan Inc. on Wednesday, charging that the company provided flight and logistical support to at least 15 aircraft on 70 so-called "rendition" flights. The suit, to be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, is being made on behalf of Binyam Mohamed, Abou Elkassim Britel and Ahmed Agiza, who the ACLU said were abducted by the CIA, detained and tortured. The complaint alleges Jeppesen organized flights over a four-year period to countries "it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted standards." "Extraordinary rendition should be condemned. It should not be seen as a source of corporate profit," Anthony Romero, ACLU executive director, told a news conference. A European Parliament-backed report found at least 1,245 CIA flights were made into or over Europe in the four years after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Washington acknowledges the secret transfer of suspects to third countries but denies torturing them or handing them over to countries that did. Jeppesen declined to comment on the ACLU suit, and would not say if the CIA was a customer. According to the ACLU, Jeppesen played a key role in what it called Washington's extraordinary rendition program, providing aircraft crew with itineraries, preparing flight plans, procuring landing permits from foreign governments and helping with customs clearance and ground transportation. &copy; Reuters 2007.

In the deadliest clash, Taliban ambushed a police convoy in Shahjoi district of southeastern Zabul province on Wednesday. The ensuing gunbattle left 16 police and 10 suspected insurgents dead and six police wounded, said Interior Ministry spokesman Zemeri Bashary. On Thursday, Afghan and NATO forces launched an operation in neighboring Helmand province&#039;s Sangin district, a Defense Ministry statement said. "Tens of enemies" were killed and wounded in clashes and airstrikes, it said. There was no immediate confirmation from NATO about the operation, nor was it possible to verify the casualty figures reported by the government from the remote battle site. After a winter lull in violence, both militant attacks and military operations have escalated this spring, with Helmand province bearing the worst of the violence as NATO and Afghan forces fight to root out militants from the country&#039;s opium heartland.

NATO wants to secure the area around the hydropower facility to allow a reliable electricity supply to support development that has been slow in coming to the region. In the west, insurgents launched an attack in Farah province&#039;s Pusht Rod district late Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said. Police fired back, killing 10 militants and wounding 15 more, a ministry statement said. In the south, militants were planting mines on the main highway between Panjwayi and Kandahar city on Wednesday night when one of the charges exploded, killing two and wounding another, who was arrested, said Panjwayi district chief Niaz Mohammad Serhadi.

Sutiyoso, a retired general, said he received an apology from Bill Farmer, the Australian ambassador, during a meeting in Jakarta on Thursday. "The Australian side has apologised and we will get an official apology letter," Sutiyoso told reporters after the meeting. An Australian embassy spokesman declined to comment. "We are a nation with a big heart," said Sutiyoso. "We have to forgive, even more so because the problem was only a technical problem." Indonesia demanded an explanation from Australia after Sydney police tried to deliver a summons to Sutiyoso in his hotel room requesting that he give evidence at an inquest into the death of an Australia-based journalist in East Timor in 1975. The governor of Indonesia's capital city said on Wednesday that police used a master key to enter his hotel room. The row prompted a demonstration outside the Australian embassy in Jarkata, with Indonesian protesters demanding an apology. Sutiyoso, who was scheduled to visit Canberra after Sydney, cut short his visit and flew back to Jakarta early on Wednesday, saying he felt "slighted by such treatment". A spokesman for Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the Indonesian president, said the president was "surprised" at the incident and expected that Australia would clarify the matter. John Howard, Australia's prime minister, also sought to calm the row saying that, while coroners conducting inquests acted independently of the government, "proper courtesy should be extended" when they carried out their work. Sutiyoso served in the Indonesian military for three decades and was part of 's occupation of the half-island nation. The inquest in Sydney is probing the death of a cameraman who was among five British, Australian and New Zealand newsmen killed in the border town of Balibo, in East Timor, ahead of the Indonesian military's invasion in 1975.

Former president Lee Teng-hui ( ) yesterday said he would like to visit the Yasukuni shrine, a controversial memorial to war dead where his elder brother is enshrined. Lee's elder brother served in the Japanese navy and died while on duty in February 1945 in the Philippines. "I have not yet decided on the timing, but since I am here, I think that I should go see my brother," Lee told reporters on his arrival at Narita airport near Tokyo. "I will meet my brother for the first time in 60 years," Lee said. Lee, accompanied by his wife Tseng Wen-hui ( ), left for Japan yesterday for a 10-day visit. Speaking to Japanese reporters on the flight from Taipei, the 84-year-old former leader said he wanted to pray at the Yasukuni shrine because he did not know how much longer he would live. The Yasukuni shrine honors 2.5 million war dead, including colonial subjects who fought for Japan. Visits to the shrine by Japanese leaders have long been a subject of dispute with China and South Korea which view the shrine as a symbol of Japan's militarist past. Most controversially, the Shinto shrine lists the names of 14 top war criminals from World War II. "I will meet my brother for the first time in 60 years." Lee Teng-hui, former president Based on the itinerary released by Lee's office, the former president will spend the first three days visiting Tokyo, culminating in a ceremony wherein he will be presented with the first Shinpei Goto Prize by Tokyo's Shinpei Goto Society tomorrow. The prize was established to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of the late Japanese colonial administrator Shinpei Goto and is awarded to people who have contributed to national or regional development. From Saturday to Tuesday, Lee will make an "oku no hosomichi" tour covering the prefectures of Miyagi, Yamagata, Iwate, Akita and Gunma, retracing a journey made by the Japanese poet Basho in 1689 on which his famous work The Narrow Road to Oku Lee is scheduled to visit Akita International University next Wednesday, where he will give a speech on Japanese education and hold a seminar with Taiwanese students. He will also visit Takushoku University in Tokyo to discuss the global outlook this year. He will wrap up his visit next Saturday. This story has been viewed 606 times.

Bush: A major Presidential decision was greeted with bipartisan praise and international congratulations. By picking former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick on May 30 to replace Paul Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank, Bush made a symbolic and substantive statement that he hoped to unify the controversy-wracked institution and put Wolfowitz's divisive, two-year tenure quickly behind him. Wolfowitz resigned his position, effective June 30, amid ethics questions raised by his role in securing a generous compensation package for his girlfriend (see BusinessWeek.com, 5/17/07, "More Problems After Wolfowitz" An Expert in Diplomacy Zoellick, like Wolfowitz, is known as an accomplished academic and a demanding boss. But unlike the combative Wolfowitz, the prospective bank president has a reputation as an expert in diplomacy and international banking. Zoellick, 53, served as a top State Dept. official under President Bush, and the top Treasury Department official on international economic matters. He was also President George H.W. Bush's top adviser for two Group of Seven international economic summits, as well as a managing director at Goldman Sachs ( ) and chairman of the company's international advisers department. His global economic expertise includes work on issues from Latin American debt relief and German reunification to Chinese entry into the World Trade Organization and restructuring U.S. aid programs for Africa. Democratic Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, lauded Zoellick as "the right person for this job." Said Baucus: "It's hard to imagine a more intelligent, hard-working, and capable person to assume the bank's leadership at this difficult point in its history. Bob has the skills and the integrity to put the bank back on the right path." Not Much of a Honeymoon House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) praised Zoellick's efforts to bring peace to war-torn Darfur, calling him a sensitive and caring person. Even Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.), Bush's vanquished 2004 Presidential rival, says Zoellick "brings a diverse range of skills and international experience to the position" and hopes he "can regain the confidence of employees and donor nations that was lost under the previous leader." Kind words aside, Zoellick can't expect much of a honeymoon in his new job as the bank's 11th president in its 60-year history. Bank-watchers say he has a lot of work to do to soothe the hard feelings generated by Wolfowitz, whose role as an architect of the Bush Administration's Iraq policy rankled European allies and bank staffers. "His major initial challenge is to rebuild the morale of the organization and to bring someone with a strong management background in to put things back together again in a better way than before," says Edwin "Ted" Truman, senior fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Center for International Economics. During the White House announcement ceremony, Bush and Zoellick both alluded to the recent divisions and the challenges ahead. Zoellick, said Bush, "has earned the trust and support of leaders from every region of the world." Zoellick declared that "we need to approach this task with humility and creative minds." He praised the World Bank staff that warred with Wolfowitz as "many fine professionals from all over the world." "The World Bank has passed through a difficult time for all involved," Zoellick said during the nine-minute event in the Roosevelt Room. "There are frustrations, anxieties, and tensions about the past that could inhibit the future. This is understandable, but not without remedy. We need to put yesterday's discord behind us and to focus on the future together."

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070531.wnewipper0531/BNStory/National/home&cid globeandmail.com: Governments, police share Ipperwash blame, probe says Letters to the Editor Governments, police share Ipperwash blame, probe says TENILLE BONOGUORE AND BRODIE FENLON AND ANTHONY REINHART Globe and Mail Update May 31, 2007 at 12:03 PM EDT &#151; The Ontario Government has apologized for the events that led to Dudley George's death and pledged to move forward in honour of his memory. David Ramsay, Minister of Natural Resources and Aboriginal Affairs, announced the formation of an Ipperwash response team to implement the recommendations of Commissioner Sidney Linden in his inquiry report released Thursday. Mr. Ramsay said this was a &ldquo;turning point&rdquo; for the province, which will benefit all Ontarians. &ldquo;The message is clear. Only by working together can we achieve the common goal of prosperity and equal opportunity for Aboriginal people across this province,&rdquo; Mr. Ramsay said. Sept. 7, 1995. A spray painted sign at Ipperwash Provincial Park reflects Natives' anger about the 1995 confrontation that left protester Anthony O'Brien (Dudley) George dead. (The Globe and Mail) Sam George comments on findings Dudley George's brother speaks with reporters following the release of Thursday's report Inquiry Commissioner Sidney Linden speaks Inquiry Commissioner speaks with reporters from Forest, Ont. Report a road map to unity, peace, aboriginal leaders say Murray Klippenstein on the Ipperwash Inquiry Report Bob Runciman on the Ipperwash Inquiry Report Storm of scandal to finally clear In the 1433-page report, Commissioner Linden offered a scathing review of Ontario Provincial Police operations on the night 38-year-old Dudley George was shot at Ipperwash Provincial Park. He apportions blame to federal and provincial governments as well as the OPP for the stand-off, and makes 98 recommendations that he hopes will help all peoples reach a path of healing. Minutes before the provincial apology, Dudley George's older brother Sam said he was hoping for an apology from Mike Harris, who was Premier at the time. Failing that, he said it was fitting for the province to apologize for him. &ldquo;What Mr. Harris did was act too fast, and closed off many options including negotiations, communications,&rdquo; Mr. George said. &ldquo;We hold him partially responsible for what happened, because of that acting too fast. &ldquo;We wonder if it might be appropriate at this time for Mr. Harris to apologize to my family, or maybe, if Mr. Harris chooses not to, for the government of Ontario to do so. Maybe that is not too much to ask.&rdquo; But Peter Donard, lawyer for Mr. Harris, immediately rejected calls for an apology. &ldquo;This commissioner has made it clear that no apology is required,&rdquo; Mr. Donard said in a testy exchange with reporters. &ldquo;As far as Mr. Harris is concerned, this commission has found specifically in the report that there's no evidence to suggest that either Premier Harris or any member of his government is responsible for the death of Dudley George.&rdquo; Prime among the report recommendations is a call to establish a stand-alone Aboriginal Affairs Ministry within the provincial cabinet, with adequate resources, and for the Federal Government to publicly apologize to the people of Kettle and Stony Point First Nation for failing to honour its promise to return its land. He also urged the creation of a treaty commission of Ontario to settle land and treaty claims, an Aboriginal Reconciliation Fund, more federal involvement with land claim disputes, and new regulations under the Police Services Act to ensure all government directions are in writing and made public to the Commissioner. Judge Linden calls for the OPP to make a public apology to Cecil Bergard George for the beating he sustained in the parking lot where Mr. George was fatally shot by police officer Ken Deane. But in his report, Judge Linden says the matter goes well beyond Mr. Deane and the Inspector who sent him in at 11 p.m. along with a riot squad and other specialist officers. The OPP as an institution also needs to be accountable and share responsibility for the tragedy, as does the Federal Government, he says. &ldquo;Unfortunately, the issues that were at the heart of the Ipperwash occupation remain unresolved by the federal government to this day. This inexcusable delay and long neglect, by successive federal governments, are at the heart of the Ipperwash story.&rdquo; Politically, the hotbed that was Queens Park after the 1995 election played a substantial role in proceedings by Lake Huron that night. Judge Linden found that Premier Mike Harris or someone in his office did convene a meeting on the evening of Sept. 6, 1995, commonly referred to as &ldquo;the dining room meeting&rdquo;. While he found that Mr. Harris did make the controversial comment that he &ldquo;wanted the fucking Indians out of the park&rdquo;, he questions exactly when that comment was made. It was Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson who said the same phrase the &ldquo;dining room meeting&rdquo;, Judge Linden said. The report also finds that Mr. Harris knew at least one person at the meeting was a seconded OPP officer, and that by the end of the meeting &ldquo;Premier Harris had made it clear he wanted the occupiers out of the park as quickly as possible.&rdquo; The Premier's comments in the dining room, and the speed at which he wanted a resolution, &ldquo;unduly narrowed the scope of the government's response&rdquo; and &ldquo;closed off many options endorsed by civil servants,&rdquo; Judge Linden said. And the Premier's push to have an immediate injunction and to remove the Indians from the park within 24 hours was inappropriate. &ldquo;It is for the police to decide whether and when arrests will be made.&rdquo; All of that &ldquo;created the risk of placing political pressure on the police&rdquo; when, in contrast, &ldquo;the Premier could have urged patience, rather than speed&rdquo;. But he concluded that the sum of those factors did not equate to political interference. &ldquo;In my view, although Premier Harris was critical of the police, I do not find that he interfered with or gave inappropriate directions to the police at Ipperwash,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;The Premier did not inappropriately direct the OPP on its operations at Ipperwash or enter the law enforcement domain of the police.&rdquo; The Commissioner confirms that the natives were unarmed, and that Premier Harris and Attorney-General Charles Harnick misled the legislature about the &ldquo;dining room meeting&rdquo;. Julian Falconer, the lawyer representing Aboriginal Legal Services at the inquiry, said the report was &ldquo;historical&rdquo; in that Judge Linden rejected some of Mr. Harris' testimony. &ldquo;It is absolutely unprecedented for a commissioner to make a finding that expressly finds that both the premier and the attorney general misled the house about the key dining room meeting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is a startling revelation and it is unprecedented that I know of for a commissioner to reject evidence under oath by a then premier.&rdquo; The actions of the Ontario Provincial Police were viewed scathingly by Judge Linden, whose references to &ldquo;critical failures&rdquo; on the night of Dudley George's shooting are wearyingly regular. Negotiators should have been called in first. Crowd Management Unit should not have been deployed at night. And, most importantly, the protesters should have been told that they were safe inside the fence. The police had no intention of entering the park. &ldquo;The CMU were busy yelling commands to each other when the officers should have been yelling these crucial messages to the Aboriginal people,&rdquo; Judge Linden wrote. Ontario Provincial Police lawyer Mark Sandler said the Ipperwash standoff was a catalyst for significant change within the force and that the OPP is one of the most progressive police services in the world in terms of aboriginal issues and policies. &ldquo;The OPP came to this inquiry a very different police force than it was 12 years ago,&rdquo; Mr. Sandler said. Judge Linden's criticisms hit upon many of the people mentioned during the Inquiry hearings, including the Premier's executive assistant Deb Hutton. &ldquo;Neither Deb Hutton nor Michael Harris fully appreciated at that time the power of the Premier and the Premier's office,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Regrettably, Ms. Hutton had little experience in aboriginal issues, nor did she have a sound understanding of Aboriginal culture, section 35 of the Constitution, or concepts such as colour of right.&rdquo; In response to the report, Ms. Hutton said the findings &ldquo;conclusively set to rest the unfounded allegations&rdquo; made since Dudley George's death. &ldquo;Commissioner Linden has made clear in his report that there was no political direction of the OPP,&rdquo; she said in a statement issued by her lawyer. As for the land itself, the Commissioner said allowing the status quo to continue is not in anyone's interest. Among the possibilities they could consider, he says, is the reopening of Ipperwash Park under the management of the Kettle Point and Stony Point communities, &ldquo;for the benefit of all Ontarians and visitors alike.&rdquo; On the question of reopening the park, Mr. Ramsay told reporters Thursday: &ldquo;That is not something I've been contemplating, so let's just leave it at that,&rdquo; Mr. Ramsay said.

Thursday May 31st 2007 Skip to search tools Skip to online features Skip to print edition Skip to main navigation Skip to main content Skip to bottom links Letters to the editor Middle East & Africa Economist Diaries and Business Gifts Skip to search tools Skip to online features Skip to print edition Skip to main navigation Skip to main content Skip to bottom links The party is over May 31st 2007 | BANGKOK Thailand takes a step away from democracy and freedom THE nine judges of Thailand's Constitutional Tribunal took ten hours to outline in a marathon session, televised live on May 30th, the electoral-fraud cases against the country's two main political parties (and several small ones). They explained in elaborate detail why Thai Rak Thai (TRT), the largest, was being disbanded, whereas its main opponent, the Democrat party, was cleared of all charges. However, the elegance of their legal arguments may be lost on millions of Thais. They gave TRT sweeping election victories in 2001 and 2005 and probably still support the party and its leader, Thaksin Shinawatra. As voters may see it, the country's most popular party has been destroyed by a court set up by the military junta that seized power last year, claiming to be rescuing democracy. A week before the tribunal's rulings, Thailand's revered King Bhumibol intervened, giving warning that his realm was &#8220;close to sinking&#8221; and noting that &#8220;political parties must exist&#8221;. This raised hopes that the tribunal would stop short of dissolving either main party, and punish only individual politicians. Those hopes have been dashed. In four months of hearings, the tribunal examined allegations of misbehaviour by the accused parties during a snap election Mr Thaksin had called in April last year. The Democrats and other parties boycotted the election, claiming it would be unfair. The courts later found grounds to annul the results, after the king urged them to sort out the &#8220;mess&#8221;. TRT was accused among other things of bribing small parties to take part in the election, while the Democrats were accused of inducing leaders of smaller parties to make false accusations against TRT. After the coup, the junta, led by the army chief, General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, replaced the Constitutional Court with a new tribunal, whose judges it selected, and told it to pursue the electoral-fraud cases. The junta also appointed an interim government of old soldiers and bureaucrats; and created a temporary parliament and another unelected body to write a new constitution. The generals also set up investigations into the allegations of corruption and abuse of power by the Thaksin administration, while their interim government sought to borrow some of its policies, such as cheap health care and development funds for rural villages, which had made &#8220;Thaksinomics&#8221; so popular. However, although the corruption investigations have unearthed enough evidence to press charges, they failed to find enough of a &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; to wreck Mr Thaksin's reputation irreparably. Meanwhile, the interim government has dithered and bungled, dragging down the economy and making Thaksinomics, for all its other flaws, look good. And Mr Thaksin, through a series of stunts such as bidding for Britain's Manchester City football club, has ensured he is not forgotten. This week's judgment would appear to eliminate TRT and prevent any comeback by Mr Thaksin and his henchmen. But the generals are far from being in the clear. Lesser figures in TRT may regroup and find ways to recapture the party's millions of votes, in the elections the junta promises to hold by the year's end. That is if things get that far. The junta's constitution-writing body has already backtracked on several undemocratic clauses it tried to slip into the new charter, such as permitting an unelected prime minister and allowing for a &#8220;crisis council&#8221;, including military chiefs, to step in and solve political conflicts. But other unpopular provisions&#8212;such as having the Senate appointed by judges and bureaucrats rather than elected&#8212;remain in the draft. So voters, angry at the destruction of the party many support, may reject the proposed charter in the referendum the junta is promising to hold. The mobilisation of police and soldiers ordered by the jumpy generals to head off protests, and their censorship of pro-Thaksin websites and radio stations, may not be enough to prevent rising popular unrest against the regime, despite Mr Thaksin's call on his supporters to accept the verdict.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 31, 2007 WASHINGTON, May 30 &#151; The stands ready to inherit may be battered, fractious and rudderless. But he said Wednesday that he saw himself not simply as a healer but as a leader ready to establish a new agenda to help the world&#8217;s poor. &#8220;On the one hand, one has to calm the waters,&#8221; Mr. Zoellick told reporters in the afternoon. &#8220;But one also has to start to navigate the course of the future.&#8221; At another point he said, &#8220;People in the bank recognize that it&#8217;s going to have to go through some mission adjustment.&#8221; But he declined to specify details. People close to Mr. Zoellick say that based on his record in past economic and diplomatic jobs, he is likely to bring a demanding approach that could disturb the status quo. At his session with journalists, Mr. Zoellick signaled that he would retain and build on the anticorruption policies of the departing president, , who resigned nearly two weeks ago after a furor over charges of favoritism. Mr. Zoellick&#8217;s nomination was formally announced Wednesday at the White House, where President Bush praised him for having &#8220;earned the trust and support of leaders from every region of the world.&#8221; Mr. Bush also praised Mr. Wolfowitz for making the bank &#8220;a more effective partner for development.&#8221; The bank&#8217;s 24-member board has welcomed Mr. Zoellick&#8217;s nomination but said it would accept other nominations until June 15. But bank officials dismissed the statement as a formality and predicted that the board would move smoothly toward making Mr. Zoellick president, despite reservations by some about the United States&#8217; continuing to exercise its 60-year-old prerogative of filling the job. European officials said they would not disturb the arrangement of having the American president picking the head of the bank, in part to leave intact the tradition of having Europeans pick the head of the Mr. Zoellick has been told by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and others that the bank must do more to provide concrete measures of the effects of its $23 billion in lending to poor countries, in part to assure Congress about how the money is being spent. In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Zoellick also suggested that the international community must rethink having the bank provide loans to countries like China that have access to global capital markets and possess huge foreign exchange reserves. The bank, he said, could move more into providing technical assistance to these countries. &#8220;It would have been easy to get a figurehead,&#8221; an administration official involved in the selection process said of Mr. Zoellick. &#8220;Bob&#8217;s first posture at the bank will be to listen and to travel. But he definitely brings some ideas on development. He has thought about it a lot.&#8221; Others who know Mr. Zoellick say that despite having a reputation for being a brusque and demanding executive, he is also good at setting long-term objectives and building consensus. &#8220;The World Bank, like other international organizations, needs substantial reform,&#8221; said former Secretary of State James A. Baker III , who helped bring Mr. Zoellick into government in the 1980s. &#8220;I think Bob will be a very good agent of change. It&#8217;s a huge, humongous bureaucracy. But he&#8217;s a very resourceful person.&#8221; Colleagues noted that Mr. Zoellick brought &#8220;tough love&#8221; to some of his previous jobs, most notably as United States trade representative during Mr. Bush&#8217;s first term. As trade envoy, Mr. Zoellick worked with Europeans in 2001, shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to make the next round of global trade talks focus on helping poor countries by letting them export more farm products and industrial goods to rich countries. But he also demanded that poor countries that gained from being able to export more also commit themselves to economic reforms. &#8220;He believes in rewarding opportunity, encouraging small business and frankly reducing the power of entrenched oligarchies that thrive on closed markets and corrupt environments,&#8221; said Christopher A. Padilla, Mr. Zoellick&#8217;s chief of staff at the trade office and when he was deputy secretary of state. &#8220;That agenda was a very important component of what we were trying to achieve,&#8221; said Mr. Padilla, now an assistant secretary of commerce for export administration. &#8220;I&#8217;m confident he will bring the same agenda to the World Bank.&#8221; There are some at the World Bank, many bank officials say, who may resist a bias toward encouraging free-market economies, especially at a time when faith in that philosophy has faded in Latin America and elsewhere. But bank officials said they would welcome a new president with knowledge in this area. &#8220;A lot of people used to think that if the Democrats win the White House in 2008, we might get a new president who won&#8217;t be pursing free markets and corruption,&#8221; said one bank official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. &#8220;But most people at the bank also realize that reform is necessary.&#8221; The official added: &#8220;Sure, Zoellick is coming with an agenda. People at the bank will be focusing on whether he is going to be fixated on trade. But he&#8217;s a basic policy wonk.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Death of Guantanamo Detainee Is Apparent Suicide, Military Says Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, May 31, 2007; Page A08 A Saudi detainee at the , was found dead in his cell from an apparent suicide yesterday afternoon, military officials said. He would be the fourth detainee to take his own life at the facility in the past year. Military officials at U.S. Southern Command did not release details about the death or identify the detainee, who was among about 80 Saudi Arabians in custody. Attorneys with the Center for Constitutional Rights, a -based law group that represents many Guantanamo detainees, said they had learned no details as of last night and did not have independent confirmation that the death was a suicide. In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article "The detainee was found unresponsive and not breathing in his cell by guards," military officials said in a news release on Southcom's Web site. "The detainee was pronounced dead by a physician after all lifesaving measures had been exhausted." Naval Criminal Investigative Service has started an investigation, and a cultural adviser is assisting officials at the base to ensure that the detainee's body is handled in a "culturally sensitive and religiously appropriate manner," according to the release. Three detainees committed suicide in their cells simultaneously on June 10, 2006, using clothes and sheets to fashion makeshift nooses. officials called the incident an act of "asymmetric warfare" and a way to garner negative publicity for the detention facility on the U.S. base. Those detainees, according to the military, allegedly conspired with others to carry out a suicide pact and passed notes among themselves about how to do it. The three suicides in June were the first detainee deaths reported at Guantanamo since it opened in January 2002. As of last year, there had been more than 40 suicide attempts by about 25 detainees, including some who had tried to overdose on hoarded drugs and one who repeatedly tried to die by hanging and slashing himself. Such cases are illustrative of the negative image that Guantanamo has internationally; even Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has expressed a desire to close the facility because of the taint it carries. Attorneys for detainees have talked emotionally about the desperation their clients feel and have railed against what they consider worsening conditions at the facility's newest camp, which is modeled after U.S. prisons. There are about 380 detainees at Guantanamo, fewer than half of the 775 detainees who have been there since it was opened to house those captured in the war in and in the larger Bush administration effort against terrorism. Three detainees have been charged with crimes under the Military Commissions Act of 2006. and at Guantanamo referred all inquiries to Southcom. A Southcom spokesman said last night that he could not elaborate on details of yesterday's death. Wells Dixon, an attorney at CCR, said last night that he has asked the for information about the detainee, and that his organization is already calling for an independent investigation into his death. Dixon, who visited Saudi detainees at Guantanamo earlier this month, said they "were suffering terribly." "The fact that four detainees have now died while in military custody should not surprise anyone," Dixon said. "These results are predictable, given the fact that these men have been confined for so long without charge or trial under such difficult circumstances."

Turkey beefs up military presence on Iraqi border Turkey continued to reinforce its military presence along its border with Iraq on Wednesday, fuelling concerns of an impending incursion into the neighbouring country's Kurdish north. (AP - 31/05/07; Reuters, AP, BBC, VOA, NTV MSNBC, Stratfor, Turkish Press - 30/05/07; AP - 29/05/07) PKK training camps in northern Iraq would be the target of any cross-border military action by Turkey. [Getty Images] Turkey sent more tanks and troops to its border with Iraq on Wednesday (May 30th), fuelling speculation about an imminent military offensive against Kurdish rebels based in the neighbouring country's north. According to Reuters, a group of 20 tanks loaded on trucks left the army barracks in Mardin near Syria and headed east towards the border. Large contingents of soldiers, tanks, guns and armoured personnel carriers are said to be already deployed in the region. Wednesday's move came a day after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged the United States and Iraq to destroy PKK rebel bases in northern Iraq, refusing to rule out possible unilateral action by his country. "We expect the United States and Iraq to destroy, scatter bases of terrorists there," the Turkish leader said in remarks on private NTV television late Tuesday. "Our expectations have been relayed to the opposite side. We have to achieve results. It would not be right to spell out a deadline." The PKK has been fighting for self-rule in Turkey's Kurdish-dominated southeast since 1984, leading a campaign of bombings, kidnappings and armed attacks that have left more than 30,000 people dead. The group is outlawed in Turkey, and is listed as a terrorist organisation by both the EU and the United States. Ankara authorities believe up to 2,300 PKK militants operate inside Turkey, while about 3,800 have found shelter in northern Iraq. Public pressure has been increasing on the government since a suicide bombing on May 22nd that killed six people and injured more than 120. Six Turkish soldiers died the following day when their vehicle hit a landmine in a southeastern area where PKK guerrillas are active. Another soldier was killed by a landmine Wednesday in the province of Hakkari, near the Iraqi border. A total of 13 Kurdish rebels have been killed in clashes with the Turkish forces since Monday. "The PKK must be eliminated as a problem between Iraq and Turkey," the Turkish special envoy to Iraq, Oguz Celikkol, was quoted as saying on CNN-Turk television on Wednesday. After a visit to Iraq this week, he voiced hope that the Kurdish issue will be resolved before Turkey decides to take unilateral action. The Turkish Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, called on Iraq to move against the PKK rebels on its territory. "What we want from the Iraqi government is to take the necessary steps to stop the terrorists' activities by any means," Foreign Ministry spokesman Levent Bilman told reporters. Asked whether Ankara had notified Baghdad about a possible Turkish cross-border attack, he said "We do not have to inform anybody about the possibility of such an intervention." Concerned about the impact on regional stability, the United States has urged Ankara against taking unilateral military action. The best way for dealing with the problem without jeopardising peace in the border region is through US, Turkish and Iraqi co-operation, officials in Washington have said.

Two soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb during a foot patrol yesterday, the military said without specifying the exact location. Another soldier died from a 'non-battle related cause' in Baghdad on Tuesday, bringing the total for May to 116, the highest since 137 troops died in the November 2004 full scale invasion of Fallujah. 'First and foremost, it's been a tough month,' Brigadier General Perry Wiggins, deputy director of regional operations with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at a Defense Department briefing yesterday. Wiggins attributed the rise in casualties to renewed efforts to restore stability to the war-torn country, explaining that four years into the occupation, 'we're moving into places where we haven't been, not necessarily before.' The latest fatalities bring the number of US soldiers killed in Iraq since the March 2003 invasion to 3,468, according to an Agence France-Presse count based on Pentagon figures.

Bush of wanting to have him killed in his most recent article. "I am not the first and will not be the last that Bush ordered deprived of life, or of those that he proposed to be killed as an individual or in a large group," AFP quoted Castro as saying in his article published Monday. In the article entitled 'Ideas can't be killed', Castro said Bush was recently queried "by an important person" over his Cuba policy and replied, according to the Cuban leader, "I am a hard-line president and I only await Castro's death." Over the past two months, 80 articles have been published attributed to Castro. In another article he wrote last week, Castro said that the first surgeries had not been successful which had prolonged the recovery period. Many of his articles have attacked Bush's promotion throughout the region of using food crops to produce ethanol to fuel vehicles.

On Wednesday the Constitutional Court imposed a similar ban on 110 other members of his Thai Rak Thai party, and ordered the party itself to be dissolved. The verdicts come after the court found Thaksin's party guilty of electoral fraud. Supporters of the ousted former leader, including some of the banned party executives, planned a protest on Thursday over the court decision which stunned the country. Thai Rak Thai's rivals, the Democrat Party, were cleared of similar charges and escaped a threatened dissolution. Speaking after the verdict Thaksin, who now resides in London, asked his supporters to remain calm and respect the court's ruling. "We have to respect the rules of the game. That is, the rule of the law" Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted Thai prime minister He urged them to accept the disbanding of his party and the five-year political ban on its top leadership. "As party leader, I humbly accept the ruling and I want to urge the [Council for National Security] and government to hold general elections as soon as possible," Thaksin said in a statement read out by his lawyer in Before the ruling Thaksin told supporters to "respect the rules of the game" and "the rule of the law". The government meanwhile has announced a nationwide security clampdown for an indefinite period, placing thousands of soldiers on alert and beefing up deployments at police checkpoints. Sonthi Boonyaratglin, the general who led last September's coup, said the situation was "totally under control" and authorities were monitoring Thaksin associates and "hardcore" loyalists for possible trouble. "Security measures have been stepped up since last night and will gradually be increased," Sonthi told AFP. "The measures will be in place for a long time." The military-backed government has promised to hold elections at the end of the year after a new constitution is promulgated. Surayad Chulanont, the military-installed prime minister, has reiterated an earlier warning that he would impose a state of emergency to quell any unrest. The ruling, which cannot be appealed, held Thai Rak Thai had used "parliamentary elections only as a means to achieve totalitarian power" and disregarded the rule of law. The court's decision drew a mixed reaction, with some analysts saying it was likely to "deepen confrontation" between the military-led government and the masses. "Thai Rak Thai commanded a large rural electorate and if they don't win them over and fill that political vacuum, there will be trouble," said Thitinan Pongsidhirak, a political scientist at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. "The resistance might be quiet but it will also be deep-seated and strong," he added. But other analysts said Thai politics was entering uncharted waters, and the ensuing uncertainty could be used by any party to gain power. "A lot could happen at this point... the process of bargaining may change and things may be quite different from what people expect," said Chris Baker, a veteran analyst and author on the country's politics.

Meanwhile, the hunt was continuing for five Britons who were snatched at gunpoint from a finance ministry building in the capital earlier this week, in an abduction that has been blamed on Baghdad's Shiite militias. US forces detained two suspects in a raid on Sadr City, the eastern Baghdad bastion of Shiite cleric Moqtada Al Sadr's Mehdi Army, but it was not clear whether this operation was linked to the missing Britons. The US soldiers were killed Wednesday when a roadside bomb hit their foot patrol and brought US casualties for the month to 116, the most since November 2004 when marines fought a fierce battle to retake the city of Fallujah. Unlike in Fallujah, US forces have fought no major set-piece encounters in May, but instead have been fanning out through Baghdad and a belt of flashpoint towns around the capital in a bid to quell sectarian violence. "First and foremost, it's been a tough month," Brigadier General Perry Wiggins, deputy director of regional operations with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at a Defense Department briefing Wednesday. "We're moving into places where we haven't been, not necessarily before." April was also bloody for the US-led coalition, with 104 deaths. Taken together, the two past months have been the deadliest since invasion of March 2003. The news will increase pressure on US President George W. Bush, who has already seen domestic support for his war strategy fall to an all-time low and is facing calls to set a timetable for troops withdrawals. May's casualties coincide with a "surge" in US reinforcements, which is due to peak next month. Under this plan, US and Iraqi troops are basing themselves in exposed patrol bases in order to control Baghdad street by street. The result has seen a drop off in attacks by sectarian death squads, with every day bringing more arrests of kidnappers and weapons smugglers, but bomb attacks have continued and US troops now face an insurgent backlash. US commander General David Petraeus hopes that the surge will provide breathing space for Prime Minister Nuri Al Maliki's government, allowing him to push through laws to underpin a program of national reconciliation. But the capital's centers of power are still far from safe. Almost daily, rockets and mortar shells hit the Green Zone - the fortified district protecting the US embassy and Maliki's administration. And Tuesday, a squad of gunmen in police uniforms stormed a finance ministry building outside the zone in downtown Baghdad and dragged off five British visitors: a management consultant and his four bodyguards. The Britons are still missing amid fears that they have fallen into the hands of one of the Shiite militia groups that have infiltrated Iraq's police. Insurgents also struck an important propaganda victory May 12, when an Al Qaeda gang destroyed a small US patrol manning a temporary observation post near Mahmudiyah south of Baghdad, killing four soldiers and capturing three. The corpse of one was later found floating in the Euphrates River, with gunshot wounds to the head and torso. Almost three weeks after the attack his two comrades are still missing, despite a massive US manhunt. The missing men's commander, Colonel Michael Kershaw of the 10th Mountain Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, said that interrogations of suspects had thrown up a number of leads and that the search would continue. "Obviously we have a number of different trails we are following. They all lead to different groups. We know we have some of the people that participated," he said at a base outside Baghdad Wednesday. "We know that local insurgent groups participated. We also believe there was a level of involvement from outside the local area," he said. Kershaw's search area is a 854-square-kilometer (330-square-mile) sector in an insurgent hotbed of palm groves, farming communities, and irrigation canals dubbed "The Triangle of Death." "All units in Iraq are on the lookout for these missing soldiers and they act on intelligence as well. So really it's a nationwide search. Units act on intelligence in their areas as it comes up," the commander added. Kershaw's troops have questioned 1,100 people and detained 104 of them. "We have scooped up a few people who have either confessed to it or during questioning shown that they know too much about it not to have been there," said unit spokesman Major Web Wright. A suicide bomber in an explosives belt killed one Iraqi policeman in an attack on his patrol and wounded at least seven more people in Fallujah, authorities said.

Indonesia had lodged a formal diplomatic protest after the governor, ex-general Sutiyoso, was served with a New South Wales state police summons to attend a coroner's inquest into the 1975 deaths of five journalists in East Timor. Sutiyoso was quoted as saying Australia's ambassador to Indonesia, Bill Farmer, had expressed regret and promised to get a letter of apology from the NSW leader. "We are a big-hearted nation. We have to forgive," Sutiyoso was quoted as saying by online news service Detik.com. "Let's not make illogical demands. What's more, the Australian side has apologised and will work on an official apology," he added. Officials at his office could not immediately be reached to confirm the comments. Later on Thursday, Australian Associated Press reported NSW Premier Morris Iemma had written to Sutiyoso to apologise for any distress and inconvenience caused during his stay in Sydney. Iemma said the police action had not been sanctioned by the government and he was disappointed the governor's visit had been cut short. "The circumstances which led to the entry to your room will be thoroughly investigated," he wrote. Sutiyoso, who was in Sydney at the invitation of the state government, said two officers had barged into his hotel room on Tuesday while he was sleeping and had asked him to sign an invitation to testify in the inquest. Australian Prime Minister John Howard downplayed the row. "The relationship with Indonesia is very strong, it's very robust and it's very close. That does not alter the fact that this matter does need to be explained," he told reporters. About 50 demonstrators protested outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta on Thursday over the perceived snub, fewer than the several hundred a day earlier. Sutiyoso, who served as a captain in East Timor at the start of Indonesian occupation of the territory, said he was angry at his treatment and denied he had anything to do with the deaths of the journalists. The Sydney inquest into the death of the five Australia-based journalists heard they were deliberately gunned down by Indonesian soldiers. In final submissions to the inquest, Mark Tedeschi, the counsel assisting the coroner, said the journalists were killed in Balibo in East Timor to stop them reporting news of Indonesian military actions. Official Indonesian reports have blamed the deaths on Oct. 16, 1975 on crossfire, as Indonesian forces entered East Timor in an incursion ahead of a full-scale invasion of the territory in December of the same year. Indonesia's Foreign Ministry has warned any adverse findings from the inquiry will be ignored and will only serve to damage the fragile bilateral relationship. news is provided by Zoom to full size map Scientists warn on biofuels as palm oil price jumps Australian PM receives carbon-trade report Australia warns of violence before PNG election Australia and Philippines sign defence pact PRESS DIGEST-Indonesian General News - May 31 One year on from Jogyakarta quake, communities take charge Source: WV - International ACT Alert: Indonesia tidal waves displace thousands Source: ACT - Switzerland CWS situation report: Southeast/Southern Asia coastal flooding One year after the earthquake on Java/Malteser International: Help for more than 30,000 victims Source: Malteser International - Germany Plan launched a worldwide camapign calling for action on girls' rights abuses ATTENTION EDITORS - USE OF OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE Supporters of Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso rally outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta May 31, 2007.

Lee is on an 11-day visit to Japan. (AP Photo/Itsuo Inouye) TOKYO - Former Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui arrived in Japan on Wednesday as China expressed concerns that his trip may be politically motivated. Lee has been a strong critic of Beijing, which still claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan more than five decades after the two sides split during a civil war. Lee's office has said the 11-day trip will focus on visits to Japanese cultural sites. His itinerary, however, also includes speeches and a news conference. Earlier this week, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi expressed concerns about the trip to his Japanese counterpart, Taro Aso, during a meeting in Germany. Yang said the trip has "political implications" and may prevent progress in China-Japan relations, according to Keiji Kamei, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official. Aso said that Tokyo's understanding is that Lee will not engage in any political activities while in Japan, the official said. On Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu urged Japan to "not give any political platform for the Taiwan separatist movement." Japan has official diplomatic relations with Beijing, but not with Taiwan. China regularly opposes visits by Taiwanese officials to countries with which it has diplomatic ties. The 84-year-old former leader is to give a speech Friday at the Shimpei Goto award ceremony, named after a former administrator of Taiwan. Japan ruled Taiwan as a colony between 1895 and 1945. He is to give another speech on the global situation after 2007 at a university in Tokyo next Thursday and hold a news conference next Saturday. Lee told reporters that he also wants to visit a Tokyo war shrine where his older brother is among the enshrined. The Yasukuni Shrine deifies Japan's 2.5 million war dead and tens of thousands of Koreans and Taiwanese who were drafted into Japan's military. The shrine is vilified by critics at home and abroad as symbolizing the country's militaristic past. Class-A war criminals executed for their role in World War II are enshrined at Yasukuni.

Ann S. Banaszewski, 45, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor DUI after her arrest earlier this year outside a fast-food restaurant. Banaszewski was placed on 18 months of court supervision and ordered to perform 140 hours of public service, nearly one-third of which must be with an agency that serves children. She also must continue with counseling and treatment and attend a victim-impact panel regarding the effects of drunken driving. Banaszewski was fined $2,155. Police stopped her Ford Ecoline van at 7:25 p.m. Feb. 12 near Gamon Road and Longfellow Drive after a motorist alerted them to a possible intoxicated driver. Her blood-alcohol level is unknown because she declined to submit to a Breathalyzer test. Prosecutor Michael O'Donnell said she failed a field-sobriety assessment and admitted drinking a half bottle of vodka earlier that evening. In exchange for the plea, prosecutors agreed to drop child endangerment allegations. Banaszewski, a mother of five, had three of the children in her van that night. After the arrest, she voluntarily checked herself into a two-month in-patient treatment program followed by another week in a hospital. She also is attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. "We're very satisfied with the outcome of this case," defense attorney Donald Ramsell said. "I believe we were able to show the prosecution she's a very fine mother and is addressing whatever concerns were needed." DuPage Associate Judge Daniel Guerin presided over the plea deal. He granted Banaszewski a judicial driving permit Wednesday allowing her to drive only to counseling and treatment sessions. The judge, though, ordered her to abstain from alcohol, and prohibited her from driving with her children until she regains full driving privileges in late September. Banaszewski had an otherwise spotless criminal and driving history. She declined to comment Wednesday while leaving court.

Live coverage of reaction to the report Commissioner Sidney Linden released his four-volume report this morning at the Forest Memorial Community Centre, not far from the Ipperwash Provincial Park. Justice Linden concludes that while it was OPP officer Ken Deane who ultimately killed Mr. George during a confrontation between police and native protestors, the officer "should not have been in a position to shoot Mr. George in the first place." Email to a friend "The federal government, the provincial government and the OPP must all assume some responsibility for decisions or failures that increased the risk of violence and made a tragic confrontation more likely," Justice Linden states in his report. Justice Linden cites numerous failures in police strategy and intelligence as contributing factors in the death of Mr. George, including the failure to use aboriginal mediators to communicate with individuals occupying the park. The commissioner also criticizes a decision to send in police tactical teams at night to confront protestors based on faulty intelligence information. "The OPP Incident Commander should have realized that sending a large number of officers in darkness, with helmets, shields and guns to confront the First Nation occupiers could have easily erupted and resulted in a confrontation," the report states. Justice Linden rebuffs allegations that Ontario politicians, including Premier Mike Harris, attempted to interfere in OPP operations. "The provincial government had the authority to establish policing policy, but not direct police operations. The Premier and his government did not cross this line," the report states. However, Justice Linden does accuse Mr. Harris of making racist remarks, which "did not contribute to resolving Ipperwash peacefully." In particular, Justice Linden concludes Mr. Harris said "I want the f-king Indians out of the park," during a meeting with senior officials despite the former premier's testimony that he never uttered those words. "These comments and the speed at which the premier wished to end the occupation created an atmosphere that unduly narrowed the scope of the government's response to the occupation," Justice Linden said this morning. The report states Mr. Harris "could have urged patience, rather than speed" and criticizes the provincial government for not appointing a mediator at the outset of the conflict in September 1995. The federal government is also partly to blame for allowing "the land issue" surrounding the Ipperwash site to "fester for decades." In his report, Justice Linden concludes "the most urgent priority is for the federal government to return" the land to local native bands "immediately." The OPP sergeant who killed George was convicted in 1997 of criminal negligence causing death and sentenced to perform two years of community service. He was killed in a car crash in 2006.

Everyone on board the transport chopper was killed: the five-member US Army crew and their two military passengers, a Briton and a Canadian. NATO says troops who headed to the crash site immediately after the helicopter went down were ambushed by enemy fighters. The unit then called in an air strike to "eliminate the enemy threat." The Chinook went down in southern Afghanistan's Helmand province, which has seen heavy fighting in recent weeks. A Taliban claim of responsibility hasn't been confirmed, but a spokesman called The Associated Press to report the downing hours before NATO reported the information.

Thursday, May 31, 2007 Another Iraq War to help the Turkish Islamists? Dr. Muhammad Shamsaddin Megalommatis As the tension rises in the borders between Turkey and Iraq, Turkey continues a military build up, and the pathetic Turkish premier refuses refused to rule out action, we have to view the events in the light of the recent internal strife that brought in Turkey the secularist majority and establishment to a frontal opposition with the villainous plans of the Erdogan – Gul clique. The US needs Turkey more than Turkey needs the US We have to add to the overall picture the recent developments between Turkey and the US, namely the US incursion into Turkish aerospace. As a matter of fact, the US administration has fallen victims of the most disastrous advisers whose ability to cause unprecedented damage to the US must be internationally recognized. If America had in Europe a friend, an important country able to engage in a war without being defeated within 48 hours, that country was neither pacifist and quasi-neutralized Germany, nor pompous (and hollow) France, nor unwarlike Italy; it was pugnacious Turkey. Leaving aside the European weaklings, still today at a moment of an undeniable Russian comeback, the US – all accounts made as regards 3 dozens of European states – can count only on Turkey, Poland, and (taken as an island) the UK. This is definitely not much. At a moment of Russian threats emanate every moment in terms of energy blackmail, Middle Eastern confrontation involvement, support of Iran’s exploration of its nuclear potentialities, and opposition to the US-led War against the Islamic Terror, only a paranoid would think that America has the slightest chance to protect its own interests from the African Atlas to India, let alone prevail in the area, without an all-committed alliance with Turkey. The US needs Turkey so badly that the White House inhabitant and his power sharing Congress and Senate opponents should compete for Turkey’s favours, and incite Ankara to return in force from Somalia to Caucasus and from Algeria to Iraq. Yet, demented Pelosi supports unnecessary pro-Armenian resolutions (that concern the past, not the present), and support is offered to the one Turk who has chances – if ruling Turkey – to cause colossal damage to the US indispensable ally, Islamic terrorist premier Erdogan. Even worse, the only warrantors of Turkey’s superior military power are viewed rather inimically, although they are politically and ideologically close the US ruling class, and in addition are supported by an undeniably overwhelming majority of Turks (oscillating around 70 to 75%). The US indirect support to Erdogan is undeniable; suffice it to read the New York Times, and you get the feeling that capital of America is Mecca, and that Pelosi’s and Bush’s common enemy is the Secularist Rainbow of Turkish political parties (Nationalist, Conservative and Social-Democrat), which are expected to total 70 to 75% in the forthcoming July elections. The massive manifestations of overwhelming popular rejection of Erdogan’s Islamist agenda did not get adequate coverage in the US and the EU mass media, and when they did, the reader would be maneuvered to be negatively predisposed. Explosive situation between Turkey and the US in Iraq However, last week two US F-16 fighter jets based in Iraq made an incursion into Turkish airspace; anti-Erdogan and pro-secular Turkish media interpreted the event as an attempt to intimidate Ankara into refraining from any action inside Iraq. The US said the violation of the airspace was "unintended" and was under investigation. Then, the Turkish premier warned Washington there should be no repeat. The event took place on a harassed background of Kurdish terrorist guerilla that has long been highly and severely denounced by various populations that inhabit along with Turks the SE provinces of Turkey. Turkey made public the proofs of the PKK group’s involvement in the recent suicide bombing in Ankara and in a landmine attack on troops. The PKK has been supported and maneuvered by France since 1984, and PKK’s demands for Kurdistan’s ‘independence’ have always met France’s sympathies despite the outright majority of the non Kurdish populations that the PKK claims as Kurds Have repeatedly rejected this perspective, enjoying their status of Turkish citizens. Turkey blames the group for 30,000 deaths since then. With Turkey’ ongoing military campaign against the PKK in plain action, with some of the Iraqi Kurds overtly supporting the PKK, with the terrible oppression exercised by some tyrannical Iraqi Kurdish groups over various Iraqi minorities in the area of Iraqi Kurdistan (Turkmens, Aramaeans, Yazidis, Armenians, Circassians, and others), and with the fanatic but naïve Turkish premier saying in an interview with the private NTV news channel that Iraq, the US and Turkey should carry out a joint operation against the PKK, one understands the volatility of the situation. If one takes into consideration that the US has warned Ankara that sending troops into Iraq would complicate the situation, one can get the use of the situation that the paranoid anti-Turkish US lobbying and the secretive, racist, European Freemasonic lodges may attempt to make. The forthcoming Turkish elections and the US way to help Erdogan If we place the aforementioned within the context of the forthcoming elections, we get a clear idea of what may soon be attempted. As it happens, with the Turkish opposition uniformed into three anti-Islamist parties, an ultra-nationalist (expected to gather 15 to 20%), a conservative (estimated at 10 to 15%), and a social-democratic (projected to reach 25 to 30%), the loathsome Islamists have no chance to achieve majority in the new parliament. Their efforts to either elect an Islamic terrorist as president or to modify the constitution will therefore fail, and normally a tripartite coalition will run the country, re-launching Mustafa Kemal Ataturk’s programs and projects. This would be disastrous for the anti-Turkish side of the EU; they will not be in a position to demonize Turks as Muslims (who supposedly do not drink alcohol during dinners and lunches at Brussels) to later illustrate them as non European and fanatic radicals. It will also be disastrous for the anti-Turkish US lobbying because action will be drastically taken. So, the EU and US forces that support Erdogan must act now; tomorrow it will be very late, and they will not find an imbecile as Turkish premier. How can they help Erdogan to win the elections he is going to normally lose? Turkey to annex Northern Iraq? There is only one king maker in the world: Victory. In front of a military victory, defeat of the PKK and the Iraqi Kurds, possible merge with the Turkmens at Kirkuk, and even more theatrically, eventual clash with the Americans in Northern Iraq, Erdogan would certainly appear as the greatest man in the history of Turkey after Ataturk. An annexation of Mosul, Arbil, Kirkuk, and Suleymaniyeh would be presented by Erdogan as the end of the Kurdish problem, and a deal with Iran and Russia would help him consolidate his grip in view of the pending American departure. This would terminate the negotiations with EU but Erdogan’s victory would mean to Americans and to lesser extent to Europeans that their main obstacle in controlling Turkey economically, the secular military establishment, lost the power in Ankara. This would signal the beginning of a stronger US – EU commitment to Kurdistan’s independence, and to Turkey’s defamation as an Islamic extremist country whereby the Kurds ‘suffer’. Turkey’s inner clashes, Turkey’s involvement in the deterioration of the European states’ confrontation with their Muslim minorities, the formation of an independent Kurdistan, the Turkish explosion in the Balkans, and the establishment of the Russian – Turkish – Iranian alliance would then trigger the most unbelievable political earthquake in Europe’s History. What the apostate Freemasonic lodge was not able to achieve during 50 long years will then be materialized within months. The European Union they envisioned would then rise at last – extremely different from the present one.

In the latest in what are becoming almost daily opinion pieces called ''Reflections of the Commander in Chief,'' Castro said Bush would be wise to listen to his ally, outgoing British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has made global warming a primary focus of his last weeks in office. The ailing 80-year-old Cuban leader also criticized both Britain and the United States for heavy military expenditures. ''Perhaps someone with one of the new computer programs by Bill Gates could figure out how much the war expenditures have deprived humanity of education, health and culture,'' the essay read. ''George should say what he really thinks at the G-8 meeting, including the subject of the dangers threatening peace and food for human beings,'' Castro added. ``Someone should ask him. And he should not try to escape from the counsel of his friend Blair.'' Germany, which holds the rotating European Union and G-8 presidencies, is proposing a target that would allow global temperatures to increase no more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit before being brought back down. Experts have said that means a global reduction in emissions of 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. In Berlin on Tuesday, Bush's environmental advisor, James Connaughton, told reporters the United States opposes the EU's target. He said the United States does not oppose emission goals, but prefers to focus on specific areas such as reducing gasoline dependence and developing cleaner coal energy. ''The temperature target is one that the European Union has come to adopt but is not one that any of the other countries is prepared to adopt,'' Connaughton said. He said the United States favors ``setting targets in the context of national circumstances.'' Castro's latest message came a day after his last one, in which the Cuban leader said Bush was waiting for him to die but could not kill his ideas. Castro has not been seen in public in 10 months, and the written opinions he has released since late March seem to be his attempt to have his voice heard in international debate. The Cuban leader announced July 31 that he had undergone emergency intestinal surgery and was stepping aside for his younger brother Ra&uacute;l, the defense minister. Senior Cuban officials have said Castro is on the mend, but his exact ailment and condition remain state secrets. &#150; All Job Categories &#150; QA - Quality Control Restaurant - Food Service Skilled Labor - Trades &#150; All United States &#150; About the Real Cities Network Terms of Use & Privacy Statement About the McClatchy Company Copyright 2007 Miami Herald Media Co.

Falluja police spokesman Hamid Abid said the bomber, wearing a suicide explosives vest, walked up to a queue of about 150 young men at a police recruitment centre and blew himself up. Abid put the total number of killed and wounded at between 45 and 50. Bilal Mohammed, a doctor at Falluja hospital, said 20 had been killed and 20 wounded. Falluja, 50 km (35 miles) west of Baghdad, is in restive Anbar province, a stronghold of Sunni Arab insurgency. Recruitment centers for Iraqi security forces are common targets for such attacks, which are mostly blamed on Sunni Islamist al Qaeda. Some Sunni Arab tribes in Anbar have been encouraging young men to join the Iraqi security forces in Anbar as part of a new strategy to combat al Qaeda in the area. Al Qaeda in turn has been waging a campaign against tribes who cooperate with authorities in Anbar. The U.S. military has more than 6,000 troops in Anbar, where local commanders have said that al Qaeda accounts for about 75 percent of militants in and around Falluja. &copy; Reuters 2007.

http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_6026687&cid San Jose Mercury News - ACLU targets planner of so-called CIA torture flights san jose / valley start / stop paper (From the last 24 hours) ACLU targets planner of so-called CIA torture flights Prosecutors: Aptos woman lived high life on &#36;1.5 million stolen... Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals ACLU targets planner of so-called CIA torture flights SUIT ALLEGES FIRM ORGANIZED FLIGHTS Article Launched: 05/31/2007 01:33:53 AM PDT Mohamed vs. Jeppesen Dataplan Inc. court complaint (PDF) The American Civil Liberties Union on Wednesday charged that a company with offices in downtown San Jose helped the CIA transport three men who were blindfolded, housed in small quarters, beaten until their bones broke and left with mutilated genitals during brutal interrogations. Using flight documents obtained in Europe, the ACLU filed suit against the company, Jeppesen Dataplan Inc., in the U.S. District Court for Northern California for its part in the alleged kidnapping, torture and inhumane treatment of the three. From an office on Santa Clara Street in downtown San Jose, Jeppesen employees take calls from customers planning international flights or looking for weather reports. According to the complaint, Jeppesen helped the CIA get fly-over and landing permits in other countries and provided itineraries and lodging for the flight crews. The flights took people the CIA wanted to interrogate to prisons in countries - Morocco and Egypt - that allow torture or to then-secret CIA-run detention facilities where the U.S. government argues that its own laws do not apply, according to the lawsuit. "These are places the whole world, including our own State Department, know use torture as an interrogation procedure," ACLU attorney Ann Brick said. According to the lawsuit, the company worked with at least 15 of the CIA planes for a total of 70 flights. Jeppesen spokesman Mike Pound said he could not comment on the lawsuit nor could he confirm whether or not Jeppesen scheduled flights for the CIA. "We've got thousands of customers. Every one of them has the expectation of privacy," Pound said. The company, he added, works with private pilots, companies with planes and, on occasion, governments. But during a press conference outside the company's downtown office, the ACLU's Brick alleged "this company provided essential flight information and material support that allowed the CIA" to carry out its interrogation program. CIA suit thrown out A similar lawsuit brought by the ACLU against the CIA for another case has been twice thrown out by U.S. courts after the government said it could not release key information in the case because doing so could harm national security. The ACLU also announced Wednesday that it will petition the U.S. Supreme Court to hear that case on the grounds of a 1789 law that allows foreign nationals to bring cases in U.S. courts, the same law it is using in the Jeppesen case. The men in Wednesday's lawsuit are Ahmed Agiza, 45, an Egyptian citizen living in Sweden; Abou Elkassim Britel, 40, of Italy; and Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian seeking political asylum in England. Agiza was in the process of applying for political asylum in Sweden with his family when he was picked up by Swedish security police and handed over to the CIA in 2001, according to the ACLU. The group reports that CIA officers stripped him, blindfolded him, inserted suppositories in him and put him aboard a Jeppesen-arranged plane on a flight to Egypt, where he was wanted for allegedly being part of an outlawed political group. He remains in prison in Egypt, a country known to use torture on its inmates. Police in Pakistan picked up Mohamed as he traveled back to England from Afghanistan in 2002. Blindfolded and shackled, he was allegedly put on a Jeppesen-arranged flight to Morocco. There he was imprisoned and guards cut his genitals and beat him as they questioned him about Al-Qaida, according to the ACLU. Fearing more torture, the ACLU says Mohamed repeated what his captors wanted to hear in a canned confession. In 2004 he was put on another Jeppesen-coordinated flight and sent to Guanta&#96;namo Bay, where he is still imprisoned. As Britel visited Iran and Pakistan on a research trip in 2001, he was picked up by Pakistani police in Lahore and beaten and turned over to the CIA, the ACLU alleges. The CIA placed Britel onto a plane arranged by Jeppesen, the group says, and took him to a Moroccan prison, where he was beaten and deprived of food and sleep. Under stress, he eventually signed a confession that the ACLU says he was never allowed to read. He was sentenced to nine years in prison.

In comments likely to deepen a Russian-British feud reminiscent of Cold War spy scandals, Britain's chief suspect Andrei Lugovoy rejected Litvinenko's deathbed charge the Kremlin had ordered his poisoning with highly radioactive Polonium 210. At a packed news conference in Moscow, Lugovoy said he suspected MI6, the mafia and Boris Berezovsky, a multi-millionaire Kremlin critic who fled Russia for London, could have been involved in Litvinenko's murder. "The main role was played by British secret services and their agent Berezovsky," a confident and combative Lugovoy, himself a former KGB agent, told a news conference aired live on state television. "The poisoning of Litvinenko could not have been but under the control of British secret services," he said. Asked whether he had firm proof of British intelligence involvement in the murder, Lugovoy replied: "Yes". But Britain hit back by saying its request for Lugovoy's extradition from Russia -- which Moscow said it could not meet -- had nothing to do with MI6. "This is a criminal matter and is not an issue about intelligence," a Foreign Office spokesman said. "A British citizen was killed in London and UK citizens and visitors were put at risk." Looking tanned and dressed in a dapper pink shirt, Lugovoy said the Kremlin's enemies and the Western press were portraying him as a "Russian James Bond" in a campaign to tarnish Russia's image. &copy; Reuters 2007.

Bush on Thursday committed the US for the first time to take part in negotiations on a successor to the Kyoto treaty and agreed to set goals for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The decision appeared to mark a landmark break by Washington from its longstanding opposition to global limits on carbon emissions, although the US plans still fall short of some European demands. A senior US administration official said Mr Bush would announce the new position in a speech in Washington on Thursday morning. Mr Bush was expected to pledge to work with several other large economies, including China and India, to agree a â€œlong-term goalâ€ for reduction in emissions, together with strategies for achieving the target, within 18 months â€“ before he leaves office in January 2009. The official said the US would seek to convene a conference to set the process in motion, possibly as early as this autumn. The process would complement broader international efforts to agree a replacement for the Kyoto protocol on carbon emissions when it expires in 2012, said the official. Washington refused to sign up to the Kyoto treaty and had until Thursday appeared unwilling to engage in negotiations about its successor. The policy shift came less than a week before Mr Bush travels to Germany for the annual of industrialised nations, where climate change is expected to be high on the agenda. Mr Bush has faced years of pressure from European leaders to increase US co-operation with international efforts to tackle global warming. The US was sending a â€œlong-term signal that we want to reduce greenhouse gases significantly,â€ said the administration official. He warned that the US and Europe remained at odds over European calls for an attempt to limit global temperature increases to a certain target. But he said transatlantic agreement on climate change now far outweighed the disagreement.

VOA's Al Pessin reports from the Pentagon officials say the increased tempo of U.S. military operations in Iraq is responsible for some progress toward establishing security in Baghdad, but also for the high U.S. death toll this month. As of late Wednesday, the Pentagon reports that 115 U.S. troops have been killed so far in Iraq in May, with one more day left to go, making the month one of the deadliest of the war for U.S. forces. "It's been a tough month," said Brigadier General Perry Wiggins. At a Pentagon news conference, General Wiggins said the greater risks of the new Baghdad Security Plan were known in advance, and he said the increased presence of U.S. troops in the city's neighborhoods is creating progress, as well as casualties. "We're moving into places where we haven't been, not necessarily (ever) before but we haven't been and stayed with the frequency that we're staying in these areas now. And there are some areas where, in the past, the enemy elected to just move on out, wait until we departed and come back in. In this particular case, they're finding that harder to do," he said. General Wiggins said commanders are "starting to see a shift of momentum" with more support from ordinary Iraqis and a 50 percent decrease in insurgent attacks in western al-Anbar Province. But he also acknowledged what he called a slight increase in attacks in Baghdad. He could not immediately provide specific figures for either location, but the general said insurgents continue to be able to carry out dramatic, large-scale bombing attacks, and also to hit U.S. and Iraqi targets with smaller bombs. The general charged that Iranian operatives are providing technology and training to some Iraqi insurgents, and that some of the training is done by the elite Iranian Quds Force inside Iraq. But he said the U.S. military still has not determined which, if any, senior Iranian officials are behind the effort.

A hurricane research team has renewed its forecast for an "above average" 2007 Atlantic storm season. REUTERS/Carlos Barria MIAMI (Reuters) - The Colorado State University hurricane research team renewed its forecast for an "above average" 2007 Atlantic storm season on Thursday and predicted 17 tropical storms, with nine growing to hurricane strength. Of those, five would grow into major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher with winds over 110 mph (177 kph), the team founded by forecast pioneer William Gray said in its revised forecast. The updated forecast issued on Thursday was unchanged from the team's April 3 forecast for the six-month storm season that starts on Friday. ADVERTISEMENT (article continues below) The researchers said there was a 74 percent chance that at least one major hurricane would hit the U.S. coastline in 2007, with a 50 percent chance that would happen on the U.S. Atlantic Coast and a 49 percent chance on the Gulf of Mexico coast. An average season brings 11 tropical storms, with six reaching hurricane wind speed of 74 mph (119 kph) and two growing into major hurricanes. Other private and government weather researchers have also predicted a more active season than average. But so far none have forecast anything like a repeat of record-breaking 2005, when 28 tropical storms spawned 15 hurricanes, including Katrina which flooded New Orleans and parts of the Gulf coast.

In an article to be published Wednesday, in Cuba's state-run newspaper, Granma, Mr. Castro says those attending the meeting should ask the U.S. leader how he really feels about climate change and other dangers threatening peace and basic human needs, such as food. He also said that he should not try to escape the question with the help of his friend, British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Leaders from the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia will attend the three-day Group of Eight summit in Germany beginning June 6. Cuba's 80-year-old leader has not appeared in public since temporarily handing power to his brother, Raul, last July. However, Cuban media have released photographs and video of the president, and he has published several editorials. Some information for this report was provided by AFP and AP.

The U.K. applied Monday for the extradition of Lugovoi, a former security officer turned businessman, saying it had enough evidence to charge him with the murder of Litvinenko, Berezovsky&#39;s associate who died of radioactive poisoning in London in November. "Today I would like to make an announcement, which should shed some light on this dark political story, where the main roles were played by the British secret service and their agents Berezovsky and the late Litvinenko," Lugovoi told a Moscow news conference, adding that British intelligence had also approached him with an offer of cooperation. Russian prosecutors have refused to extradite Lugovoi, saying it was against Russian law. Moscow has also been fruitlessly seeking the extradition of Berezovsky, accused of fraud at home, from Britain where he has been based since 2001 and became a British citizen in 2003. The British Embassy in Moscow responded to Lugovoi&#39;s allegations by saying the Litvinenko case was a criminal case rather than an intelligence issue. The embassy spokesman said the U.K. was waiting for an official and constructive response from Russia regarding the extradition request. The spokesman said a British citizen had been murdered, and other Britons and foreigners had been exposed to danger. The Litvinenko inquiry has discovered traces of polonium, the substance that killed the former FSB officer, in London, in Germany and in planes that flew between Moscow and London. Lugovoi quoted the late Litvinenko as saying the British secret services had recruited him first. "And then Berezovsky followed his advice and handed over some documents from the [Russian] Security Council, which he held as a former deputy council secretary, and became an MI6 agent," Lugovoi said. The businessman, who owns a private security firm, said he was ready to face Russian justice if Russian prosecutors found the evidence supplied by their British colleagues sufficient to charge him. He added he would also hire British lawyers to defend him. Lugovoi offered three versions of Litvinenko&#39;s poisoning - by the British secret services, the "Russian mafia" and Berezovsky, adding that he could prove the British secret services&#39; involvement. "I am very serious about what I am saying, including these accusations," he said. In his deathbed note, Litvinenko said Russian President Vladimir Putin had orchestrated his poisoning, an allegation denied by the Kremlin. Lugovoi told reporters Thursday that the British secret services had been looking for information to discredit Putin. "The British basically proposed that I collect any materials to discredit Vladimir Putin and his family," Lugovoi said. The businessman also said that he and his colleague Dmitry Kovtun, another former spy-turned-businessman and a witness in the Litvinenko inquiry, were victims rather than witnesses in the case. "We maintain a clear position that we are not only innocent or witnesses, but are victims," Lugovoi said. Kovtun, who like Lugovoi allegedly met with Litvinenko in London on the day he fell ill, said in Moscow Thursday that German police could arrest him if he turned up in Germany where his ex-wife lives. Kovtun stayed in her apartment in Hamburg the night before he met with Litvinenko in London. "I have received a letter through my lawyer from the German prosecutor&#39;s office, saying that if I go to Germany, they cannot guarantee that I will not be immediately arrested," Kovtun said, adding that he had no information about any criminal investigation being launched against him in Germany. German police are investigating Kovtun&#39;s possible involvement in illegally trading radioactive substances, which could be linked to the Litvinenko poisoning case. Lugovoi also accused Litvinenko of cooperating with Chechen separatist emissary Akhmed Zakayev, who has a political refugee status in Britain. Zakayev is wanted in Russia on terrorism charges. "He [Litvinenko] was in Istanbul on instructions from Akhmed Zakayev, where he met with some representatives of Chechen groups," Lugovoi said. Lugovoi said the Litvinenko case had resulted in losses of at least $25 million to his business, which also deals with soft drinks and wine. He said he had to quit the company after a Western partner requested he leave as a pre-condition for a lucrative deal. "I quit the company to save my partners," Lugovoi said. British authorities are meanwhile planning to obtain a broader European arrest warrant for Lugovoi and put him on the Interpol wanted list. Litvinenko&#39;s widow, Marina, said last week she had filed a suit against Russia with the European Court of Human Rights.

Thompson, the former Tennessee senator and star of NBC's "Law & Order," will jump into the 2008 presidential race and start raising money next week, supporters and advisers said yesterday, delivering a jolt to a GOP field that some party activists and analysts believe lacks a viable conservative candidate. Thompson set to run, in jolt to GOP field Late entry poses challenges By Scott Helman, Globe Staff | Republican Fred D. Thompson, the former Tennessee senator and star of NBC's "Law & Order," will jump into the 2008 presidential race and start raising money next week, supporters and advisers said yesterday, delivering a jolt to a GOP field that some party activists and analysts believe lacks a viable conservative candidate. Thompson, who served eight years in the Senate until 2002, plans to establish a presidential exploratory committee in the next several days, allowing him to begin collecting campaign contributions. He will make an initial fund-raising push Monday, when a select group of supporters called "First Day Founders" will attempt to raise at least $46,000 each on that day alone. Given his comparatively late entrance, Thompson will have to work intensively to build a fund-raising base and political organization. The current leading candidates -- Mitt Romney, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and former New York mayor Rudolph Giuli ani -- have each raised millions of dollars; signed on scores of advisers, fund-raisers, and volunteers; and built formidable ground operations in key early primary states. Still, Thompson, 64, is hardly starting from scratch. His acting career, as well as media speculation in the last several months over whether he would run, instantly make him one of the better-known candidates. Indeed, he already registers high -- above Romney, in some cases -- in surveys of likely Republican primary voters. Thompson's supporters say he can capitalize on a hunger many conservatives feel for a top-tier candidate they can whole-heartedly embrace. For them, McCain has gone against the GOP on too many issues, Romney's recent shifts to the right on high-profile issues undermine his credibility, and Giuliani's more liberal social positions make him a nonstarter. "Fred Thompson's entry becomes one of the defining events of the summer," said strategist Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign. "He's filling this tremendous void in the conservatives' eyes. He's got a good conservative voting record in the Senate and ran on good Southern, Tennessee values." Thompson has staked out conservative positions on major issues -- he supports gun rights, opposes same-sex marriage, and believes Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion, was wrong. He's also expressed reservations about the Senate immigration reform bill championed by McCain and President Bush. But Thompson doesn't fit the conservative mold perfectly. He has made statements in the past in support of abortion rights, and Christian conservatives backed his primary opponent when he first ran for Senate in 1994. Thompson also backed McCain's landmark campaign finance reform bill, which many conservatives vehemently oppose. And he has acknowledged having a spirited dating life between his first and second marriages. Some prominent social conservatives have privately expressed skepticism about a Thompson candidacy, questioning whether he was an enthusiastic champion for their causes in the Senate. And influential evangelical leader James Dobson, in an interview with US News & World Report earlier this year, said he hadn't seen evidence of Thompson's faith, adding, "I don't think he's a Christian." "The fact is, a lot of Republican primary voters, a lot of conservatives, are looking at the field and sort of saying, 'Hmm, this is interesting, but isn't there somebody else?' " said David A. Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union . "And Fred is somebody else. . . . The question is, who?" In recent months, he has delivered high-profile speeches to Republican groups, put together a nascent campaign team, and visited Capitol Hill to gauge support among Congressional Republicans. Earlier this spring, he fueled speculation he would run by disclosing that he had been diagnosed in 2004 with a treatable form of lymphoma. Now, Thompson faces immediate strategic decisions, including whether to compete in a key straw poll in Ames, Iowa, this August. Success in the poll frequently predicts success in the Iowa caucuses, but doing well in Ames requires methodical -- and expensive -- preparation, something Romney and other GOP candidates have been doing for months. Some Republicans report that Thompson is already generating excitement among party activists. "With all the other candidates, when you mention them with the base, it's, 'I like this, but I don't like that,' " said Brad Unruh, chairman of the Young Professional Republican Federation of Alabama. "But you mention Fred Thompson and, 'Bam, there's my candidate.' " Chip Felkel, a GOP political consultant based in Greenville, S.C., said he's picked up similar sentiments from conservatives there. "The Republican Party is looking for a candidate that has no caveats," said Felkel, who worked on Bush's election campaigns. Thompson, who first made a name for himself as an aide to the Senate Watergate Committee, had been a Washington lawyer, lobbyist, and actor when he ran for Senate in 1994 to complete Al Gore's term, though he won by running a folksy campaign as a pickup- driving populist. He was reelected in 1996 but did not run again in 2002, saying after his 38-year-old daughter died of a heart attack that January, "I simply do not have the heart for another six-year term." He has since played a steely prosecutor on "Law & Order" and has filled in for legendary radio host Paul Harvey. Wire services reported last night that Thompson has told "Law & Order" producer Dick Wolf that he won't return for the new season in September. Thompson didn't discuss any future political plans but "asked to be released from his responsibilities on the show," Wolf said in an e-mailed statement. McCain, Romney, and Giuliani all issued statements welcoming Thompson into the race, but his presence complicates things for each of them in different ways. McCain and Thompson are close -- Thompson helped lead McCain's 2000 presidential campaign, and their Senate voting records have much in common. McCain, who fell short of fund-raising expectations in the first quarter of 2007, cannot afford to lose fund-raisers or potential donors. Some analysts say Thompson's entry would deny Giuliani his status as the GOP's sole celebrity candidate. For Romney, Thompson poses a new threat in the contest for conservative voters. Thompson has also stolen away one of Romney's top supporters in Congress, Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who was with Romney until last week. But with Thompson facing questions about how badly he wants the presidency -- "I have never beaten down a lot of doors in my life," he acknowledged in a recent FOX News interview -- Romney's staff members are convinced that his organization will thwart Thompson's challenge. Thompson's supporters say he has the experience, the presence, and the demeanor to lead the country and heal some of the divisiveness that has rankled Washington. "I think it's a matter of who can best lead the country, who can win the primary, and who can bring together the Democrats, and the Independents, and certainly Republicans back under one candidate," said Mack Mattingly, a former senator from Georgia. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Dudley George was shot and killed by a police sniper in Ipperwash Provincial Park on Sept. 6, 1995. His family has waited for more than 11 years for a public inquiry to answer some of the questions surrounding his death. Commissioner Sidney Linden found HarrisÂ did not order provincial police into Ipperwash Provincial Park to remove unarmed aboriginal protesters, butÂ he could have "urged patience, rather than speed" at resolving the dispute. "The federal government, the provincial government and the OPP must all assume some responsibility for decisions or failures that increased the risk of violence and make a tragic confrontation more likely," Linden said. George, 38, was killed by a police sniper's bullet as Ontario Provincial Police moved in on the occupation by unarmed protesters atÂ the parkÂ on the shores of Lake Huron on Sept. 6, 1995. LindenÂ said in his final report, released in Forest, Ont.,Â that he didn't believeÂ Harris when he claimed he never made a racist statement about the occupiers during an informal governmentÂ meeting with provincial policeÂ just hours beforeÂ George's death. Commissioner Sidney Linden called for the disputed land along the shores of Lake Huron to be returned immediately to the Stoney Point First Nation, along with compensation. Harris acknowledged during his testimony that he wanted the occupation brought to a quick end, but denied he said, "I want the fucking Indians out of the park," as former Ontario attorney general Charles Harnick alleged during his ownÂ testimony. "After carefully assessing the evidence, it is my view that Michael Harris made the statement," Linden wrote. "I agree with Premier Harris's characterization of the statement â€¦ as racist." Harris's sense of urgency, in contrast toÂ the "go-slow" approach of police,Â "created an atmosphere that narrowed the scope" of potential peaceful resolution to the occupation, Linden said. "The provincial government could have appointed a mediator or negotiator at any time, but did not," Linden wrote. "The premier could have urged patience, rather than speed." 'Damning indictment,' Falconer says Sam George, Dudley George's brother, praised Linden's findings as a "huge and wise step forward for natives and non-natives together."Â  "I hope it is as good for you as it is for us today," Georgeâ€™s brother said Thursday. Former premier Mike Harris, seen testifying at the inquiry in Forest, Ont., denied making a racial statement at an informal government meeting hours before George was killed. GeorgeÂ saidÂ his brother's legacy is that "he stood up for what he believed inÂ â€¦ and for that he paid the ultimate price." He added it would be appropriate for Harris to apologize to hisÂ family. Â  "I think that's not too much to ask," he said. But Harris's lawyer, Peter Downard, said the report showed no apology is required from the former premier. "He did nothing wrong," Downard told reporters Thursday. The finding that Harris uttered the commentÂ is "absolutely historic," said Julian Falconer,Â a lawyer forÂ theÂ Aboriginal Legal Services of Toronto who participated in the inquiry. "This is a damning indictment," FalconerÂ told reporters after the commissioner presented his findings. "Mike Harris has a lot to account for." The inquiry also blames the OPP for ill-informed actions, cultural insensitivity and racism, faulty intelligence and poor communications. Senior OPP officers on the scene relied on "unverified and inaccurate information" when the police raid was launched, Linden said. Linden alsoÂ faulted the federal government for expropriating disputed First Nations land for military use during the Second World War, then in a series of "successive neglects," failing to give it back as promised. In the more than 60 years following the action, the Stoney Point band tried to get the land back, claiming it contained a burial ground destroyed when the military camp was built. About 30 unarmed protesters occupied the park in the summer of 1995 in response to what they said were decades of frustration overÂ the unsettled land claim. Premier Dalton McGuinty launched the inquiry into the clash at Ipperwash only days after his Liberals swept to power in 2003. Linden called for the disputed land to be returned immediately to the Stoney Point First Nation, along with compensation. The report's other recommendations: Ontario should establish a permanent, independent and impartial agency to facilitate and oversee the settling of land and treaty claims. Ontario should improve public education about its land claim policies as well as aboriginal burial and heritage sites. Access to the Ontario land claims process should depend on whether the documentation filed by the First Nations provides clear evidence that there's been a breach of the legal obligations of the Crown. The OPP should establish a formal consultation committee with major aboriginal organizations in Ontario. Provincial police should establish an internal process to ensure racist and culturally insensitive behaviour by police is dealt with publicly. The province should establish and fund an Ontario Aboriginal Reconciliation Fund. With files from the Canadian Press YOUR VIEW: What is your reaction to the findings of the report?

Lee, 84, arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday, his first visit to the Japanese capital in 22 years. Although he has said his trip is mainly for sightseeing and academic exchanges, Beijing worries that it is politically motivated. Lee, who served as Taiwanese president from 1988 to 2000, is viewed by Beijing as a leader of the island's independence movement and has emerged as a radical activist for the island's independence since leaving office. He is the spiritual leader of the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union. Japan switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1972, in deference to Beijing's "one China" policy. In the absence of diplomatic ties, Japan still imposes strict restrictions on high-level official contacts with Taiwan. On Monday, two days before Lee's arrival in Tokyo, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi expressed concerns about the trip to his Japanese counterpart, Taro Aso, when they met on the sidelines of an international conference in Germany. Yang said the trip has "political implications" and may prevent progress in Sino-Japanese relations. In an attempt to assuage Chinese concerns, Aso replied that Tokyo's understanding is that Lee won't engage in any political activities while in Japan. Despite this assurance, however, there are concerns, even among Japanese government officials, that the former president might make provocative remarks against Beijing. Unlike during his two previous visits, made after he stepped down as president, Lee is to deliver speeches and give a press conference before leaving Japan on June 9. Lee has said, "The speeches will be on cultural and academic topics and will not be political propaganda." But the international situation is the theme of one of his planned speeches. Japan expects China simply to harp on its basic Taiwan policy if Lee's visit actually ends without deviating from the stated objectives of sightseeing and academic exchanges. Both countries want to keep the recent warming trend of bilateral relations. But if Lee refers to Taiwanese independence in his speeches or press conference, Tokyo will almost certainly come under fire from Beijing. On Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu urged Japan not to "give any political platform for the Taiwan separatist movement". In addition, it is not clear what activities will constitute political ones. Indeed, Lee is to have talks with people from Japanese political and business circles in Tokyo on June 7. Former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi is reportedly among the political figures Lee meets then. Japan lifted visa requirements for short-term Taiwanese tourists in 2005. So this time Lee entered Japan without a visa. Lee's two previous visits took him to western and central Japan. This time he stepped on Tokyo soil. As the first major event on his itinerary, Lee is scheduled to receive the First Shimpei Goto Prize in a ceremony in Tokyo on Friday. Goto served as the first head of civilian affairs of Taiwan under Japanese colonial rule, which began in 1895 and lasted until Japan's defeat in World War II in 1945. Lee then plans to visit four northeastern prefectures, Miyagi, Yamagata, Iwate and Akita, tracing the route of the places written in the travel diary ("The Narrow Road to Oku [the Deep North]"), written by the master of (poetry), Basho Matsuo (1644-94), during the Edo period (1603-1867). After returning to Tokyo, Lee is to deliver a speech on June 7 about "the global situation in 2007 and beyond". Thaw in Sino-Japanese ties Because of warming ties, officials in Beijing and Tokyo are watchful about what Lee will say and do during his trip. Sino-Japanese relations sharply deteriorated under Abe's predecessor, Koizumi, who upset Beijing by repeatedly visiting Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, which honors some convicted war criminals involved in the invasion of China and much of Asia before and during World War II, along with some 2.5 million war dead. During the last few years of Koizumi's five-and-a-half-year premiership, China shunned top-level contacts with Koizumi, even during international conferences in third countries, in protest against what it viewed as his glorification of Japan's militaristic past. But bilateral relations began to warm up when Shinzo Abe succeeded Koizumi last September and made a fence-mending trip to Beijing soon afterward. In Beijing, Abe met with top Chinese leaders, including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. They agreed to "strive to build a mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests", according to a joint press statement issued then. Lee's visit comes about two months after Wen came to Tokyo in April, becoming the first top-level Chinese leader to step on Japanese soil in nearly seven years. Abe and Wen agreed to boost cooperation in economic, energy, environment and other areas to build "strategic, mutually beneficial relations". Abe conveyed his intention to visit China some time this year, as requested by Wen. Abe also extended an invitation for Hu to visit Japan early next year.

Bush will propose today a new round of discussions aimed at setting long-term goals by the world&#39;s largest energy users to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The president, in a speech today, will announce plans to convene a group of the largest emitters and energy users, including China and India, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, blamed for global warming. ``Within the next 18 months we&#39;d like to see if we can achieve consensus on a long-term goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions,&#39;&#39; a senior administration official said. The president&#39;s proposal comes as he prepares to meet with the leaders of the Group of Eight next week. U.S. negotiators have sought to eliminate climate-change targets from declarations being prepared for the meeting. The U.S. currently has a target of reducing its greenhouse gas intensity, a measure of emissions per unit of economic growth, by 18 percent by 2012. The president in 2001 withdrew the U.S. from the Kyoto Protocol, a multinational agreement that called for 35 nations to reduce emissions 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. ``The president will propose to help lead the discussions on a post-Kyoto framework,&#39;&#39; the official said. Europeans have called for long-term greenhouse gas emission reductions of 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week called for 50 percent emission reductions, without setting a baseline.

Thompson, the former Republican senator from Tennessee and â€œLaw &#038; Orderâ€ actor (though not for much longer). Speaking with Susan Page, he â€œnot only makes it clear that he plans to run, he describes how he aims to do it,â€ she writes. &#8220;I can&#8217;t remember exactly the point that I said, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to do this,&#8217; &#8221; Thompson says, his 6-foot, 6-inch frame sprawled comfortably across a couch in a hotel suite. &#8220;But when I did, the thing that occurred to me: &#8216;I&#8217;m going to tell people that I am thinking about it and see what kind of reaction I get to it.&#8217; &#8221; His late start carries some problems but also &#8220;certain advantages,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Nobody has maxed out to me&#8221; in contributions, he notes, and using the Internet already &#8220;has allowed me to be in the hunt, so to speak, without spending a dime.&#8221; Carl Hulse and Patrick Healy offer their full report on Mr. Thompsonâ€™s â€œtesting the watersâ€ committeeâ€”a step some observers see as too leisurely for an already late entrant. Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster and strategist who is not working for any candidate, said he was â€œsurprised and a little sadâ€ that Mr. Thompson had not declared himself a full-fledged candidate. Mr. Thompson has faced questions about his political commitment stemming from his days in the Senate. â€œThompson will be competing against three guys who have been running flat out for months and working their tails off for well over a year,â€ Mr. Fabrizio said. â€œIf youâ€™re not going to get in this race and double-time on work, effort and commitment, how do you expect to win? You need to send signals that say, â€˜Iâ€™m here and Iâ€™m going to win.â€™â€ Even though advisers have said Mr. Thompson is likely to enter the race in July, reports that he might have to compete in the Aug. 11 Ames, Iowa, straw poll, an important early gauge of support in the first caucus state. Senator Barack Obama and Mitt Romney outline their foreign policy proposals in the July/August issue of Foreign Affairs magazine. The Washington Postâ€™s reports that while the candidates differ on issues like Iraq and climate change, both â€œare at pains to move beyond Iraq toward an overarching vision that will convince an unsettled and war-focused public that this, too, shall pass.â€ Mr. Romney, who as governor of Massachusetts enacted a plan to require all citizens to have health insurance, called on Republicans to tackle the issue during an appearance in Iowa. &#8220;I know the Democrats are talking about that. There&#8217;s no question it&#8217;s going to be pushed by them,&#8221; he said, as reported in The . &#8220;The Republicans have to talk about it as well.&#8221; Mr. Obama called on Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a rival who heads the Senate Banking Committee, to hold hearings on executive pay. Senator John McCain, whose support of the current immigration compromise has been derided by some of his Republican competition, seemed more like he was talking to critics during an Fox News Channel&#8217;s &#8220;The O&#8217;Reilly Factor&#8221; last night than to the host, Bill O&#8217;Reilly. &#8220;Right now it&#8217;s de facto amnesty because we have 12 million people here illegally. It is a national security issue,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got two choices here, Bill. You either round up and deport 12 million people and I know of no one who thinks that&#8217;s a good idea or practicable. Or you make sure that you do everything possible to make sure that they pay a very heavy price for having acted illegally and breaking our laws.&#8221; Senator Sam Brownback elaborates on his views about evolution in a today: &#8220;The truths of science and faith are complementary: they deal with very different questions, but they do not contradict each other because the spiritual order and the material order were created by the same God.&#8221; John Edwards plans to unveil his proposal for dealing with high gas prices today in Menlo Park, Calif. Gov. Bill Richardson and Mr. Dodd joined the top-tier Democrats in announcing they will not participate in a debate sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus on Fox News Channel. The impact of the new primary schedule is palpable in Florida, reports The , noting the increase in candidate appearances there compared to previous campaign seasons. 4 comments so far... While fashions can change, bald guys are at a great disadvantage in this era of hairiness. It is true that Ike and Adlai were bald, but Ike was a political superhero even before running and Adlai&#8211;as talented as any candidate in the 20th Century, lost. After JFK hairified the entire era with his swept-brow woman-killer pate plumage, the world went nuts. The Beatles&#8217; came ashore with their mop tops; ever-longer men&#8217;s hair started racing to toward the floor. Even the rednecks started wearing mullets. Truman said Americans in 1948 would not vote for a man with a mustache, and so it was. Walrus mustaches used to be OK for leaders, but fashion had changed. Except for Sweet Baby James Taylor, the prominent go to extraordinary lengths to keep up their hair. Some of the candidates this year had their scalps treated like crop production fields with transplants set in even rows so that a later crop could yield fruit. See John Edwards. Chaney is bald&#8211;not a good sign for any bald guy. Voldemort is bald too, but that is less portentous than Chaney&#8217;s open sunroof. What makes Thompson think the public will choose him over a full head of hair?, He&#8217;s a man who walked between raindrops during his tenure in the Senate. Like James Buchanan, Thompson has no recent record of his views on the divisive issues of the day&#8211;especially those issues that divide Republicans. This would be clever posturing if he looked like Charlton Heston, but Thompson doesn&#8217;t look like a hairy Moses. He doesn&#8217;t even look like a fourth generation member of the old eastern establishment posing as a Texas hick. Thompson looks like Grandpa Munster or Elmer Fudd without the animation and speech impediment. Better for the Republicans to choose Sam Waterson, with his full head of hair, if their coalition needs a political non-entity to keep it from self-destructing. God forbid that the nation actually pick someone whose experience prepares him to govern and whose personality suggests leadership rather than clever, flexible pandering&#8211;you know, play-acting a part. Why is nobody with a mustache running? Oh yeah, Teddy Roosevelt&#8217;s daughter Alice put a hex on presidential mustaches&#8211;the &#8220;man on the wedding cake&#8221; joke. If only someone could come up with a good joke about actors who seek real world power. â€” Posted by IssyWise Mr. Brownback&#8217;s Op-Ed demonstrates yet again the religionist claim to authority that has no substantiation in reality to make certain things non-negotiable. It&#8217;s a shield for irrationality and unresponsiveness, constructed out of nothing. It is simply a fraudulent falsehood to assert that there is a &#8220;guiding intelligence&#8221; to the universe and you are privy to its intentions, as Brownback baldly claims. I see nothing in either Mr. Obama&#8217;s nor Mr. Romney&#8217;s foreign relations essays that suggests they have any awareness of the damage done to the international rule of law by Bush&#8217;s Iraq invasion on a trumped-up false pretext, and the need for the US to demonstrate to the world that we can contain our own war criminals as we maintain the world&#8217;s biggest arsenal. â€” Posted by Steve Bolger Fred said he wanted to use the internet.

But as Ron Corben reports from Bangkok, the party faithful have vowed to press on, raising fears of unrest. Thaksin Shinawatra react verdict in London, 30 May 2007 Thaksin Shinawatra, now living in London, called for Thailand's military and government to hold general elections soon. He also urged Thai Rak Thai Party members to accept the constitutional tribunal's verdict. Late Wednesday, the constitutional tribunal ordered the party Mr. Thaksin set up in 1998 to be dissolved. The judges banned more than 100 of its executives from politics for five years. Thai Rak Thai or Thai Love Thai Party, was found guilty of election violations and bribery during the inconclusive April 2006 general election, which was later annulled. Jakrapob Penkair, who had served as a Thaksin government spokesman, said the former prime minister considers the verdict too harsh. "Khun [Mr.] Thaksin expressed deep regret that the result has come this way. He himself said that it should not have been this severe. It is up to the [party] members in Thailand itself to fight for rights," said Penkair. "All I can say is that members of Thai Rak Thai will not lay down and take it." Jakrapob accuses the tribunal of issuing a political rather than legal verdict. Party officials say they will appeal. Mr. Thaksin's government was widely popular in rural areas, but was increasingly unpopular among the middle class. After nearly a year of anti-Thaksin protests in Bangkok, the military ousted Mr. Thaksin last September and appointed an interim government, which filed election fraud charges against both his Thai Rak Thai party and the leading opposition group. The government has heightened security around the country. Protests against the verdict are expected in the northeastern provinces, which are Thai Rak Thai strongholds. In Bangkok, party supporters planned a rally Thursday. The Democrat Party, which the tribunal cleared of election fraud charges, called for reconciliation. Media reports and political analysts say the ruling leaves the Democrats in a stronger position when elections are eventually held. The military and the interim government have said elections will be held after a new constitution is drafted, probably before the end of the year. Chulalongkorn University professor Somphob Manaragsan says the verdict should help the country move forward. "There is some clearer picture of the Thai political economic development after one of the deadlocks has been broken through," said Manaragsan. "I think that was a very important step." Somphob also says the public generally considers the tribunal to have been a legitimate way to resolve conflict in the country. But he doubts its verdict will end Mr. Thaksin's political aspirations. Other analysts say party members believe the tribunal discriminated against them, raising fears that deep political divides will remain.

All I do is ask questions Fear and celebration greets Hariri tribunal vote by UN to not show photographer information --> to not show image description --> to not show enlarge option --> Nico Hines and agencies A United Nations vote to set up a tribunal for suspects in the killing of Rafik Hariri, former Lebanese Prime Minister, has been given an uncertain welcome in Lebanon. Cheering crowds in Beirut greeted the decision by the Security Council last night with flag waving and celebratory gunfire in the streets, but some Lebanese newspapers this morning echoed Syria&rsquo;s suggestion that a tribunal may cause even greater instability in the country. Hariri was killed by a truck bomb in February 2005, initial UN investigations implicated Syrian authorities in his murder. The dispute over Hariri&rsquo;s death is at the centre of a deep political crisis between the Western-backed government and the Syrian-backed opposition, led by Hezbollah. There has been no official reaction from Hezbollah to the UN resolution, but the pro-opposition al-Akhbar newspaper said setting up the court without consensus &ldquo;raises serious concern for security and stability&rdquo;. Q&A: explaining the violence in Lebanon Lebanon Army battles &lsquo;al-Qaeda&rsquo; militia Beirut struggles to heal the scars of war &ldquo;The establishment of the court according to an international resolution and without the agreement of a large segment of citizens ... widens and deepens the fracture among Lebanese,&rdquo; Omar Neshabi wrote. Tensions in the divided country have become increasingly sectarian with the most intense internal fighting since the country's civil war this month. More than 50 people have been killed in fighting between the Lebanese Army and Fatah al-Islam, a heavily-armed pro-Syrian splinter group. Hariri supporters denied that the move would lead to increased violence. &ldquo;It is a historic moment an opportunity for all Lebanese to unite... the court is not about vendettas, but about justice for all,&rdquo; said Hariri&rsquo;s son Saad, leader of the parliamentary majority. "Enough divisions. .. Let's put our energies together for the sake of the nation." The UN resolution gives the Lebanese government until June 10 to settle the arrangements for a court in a neutral country. The Lebanese parliament has until now been unable to agree over the scope and remit of a tribunal to study the circumstances of the former Prime Minister&rsquo;s death. The Security Council voted yesterday by 10-0 in favour of the tribunal, but five countries abstained. Russia, China, South Africa, Indonesia and Qatar objected to using Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, which deals with threats to international peace and allows military enforcement, as a basis for the resolution. Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador to the UN, warned that only a tribunal supported by all Lebanese factions would be effective. The council's move "will give rise to a series of political and legal problems, likely to add to the uncertainties embedded in the already turbulent political and security and situation in Lebanon," he said. The vote had been requested by Fouad Siniora, Lebanese Prime Minister, who claimed the trial would allow for &ldquo;the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth&rdquo; to be revealed. The UK and the United States were among the six sponsors of the resolution. Margaret Beckett, the Foreign Secretary, said: &ldquo;The Security Council has demonstrated its support for the government of Lebanon and its commitment to the principle that there shall be no impunity for political assassinations, in Lebanon or elsewhere.&rdquo; Reaction to the tribunal from Syria was hostile. Tishrin, the government newspaper, said in an editorial this morning that the resolution was &ldquo;absolutely an American-Israeli one and could never be regarded as an expression of the international will&rdquo;. Bashar Assad, President of Syria, has threatened not to cooperate with the court if it infringes on Syrian national sovereignty. * Town / City Save to my times Also in Middle East Fear and celebration greets Hariri tribunal vote by UN Anger at campaign to woo gay couples on Holy Land holidays Lecturers&rsquo; union votes to back Israel boycott Hunt for Britons goes on amid Iraqi violence Lugovoy revels in spotlight as Russia sezies on claims Woman dies after electricity cut off 'More tender than we could imagine' Where a spell of fame begins with a bee The Times in the Middle East A series of articles on the Middle East to mark the debut of International Edition in the region The restored Hejaz Railway is to be rebuilt as an intercity express Gaza close to civil war as Hamas threatens suicide attacks News and views from Ned Parker and Stephen Farrell Full coverage of Iraq For breaking news stories and detailed analysis Your guide to seeing the very best of what the Middle East has to offer Weather forecasts for the Middle East region Latest developments in oil, gas and other natural resources She relied on an oxygen machine.

The next act is expected to play out much the same next week, when the world&#8217;s most powerful economic leaders meet at the G-8 Summit in Germany to discuss the world&#8217;s climate and what should be done to stabalize it. Europe and Japan want strict caps on greenhouse gas emissions. Developing countries only want to shoulder the burden for their relatively recent contributions to the problem, and they want to see historic polluters pony up. The U.S. stands alone in its resistance to most any action. Meanwhile, states and cities, celebrities, companies and households are taking action. The willpower to act seems everywhere present but the White House. Extreme Weather Takes Toll On Crops Offshore Oil Rigs Ready For Storms Copyright 2007 The Christian Science Publishing Society G-8 to take up climate change Brad Knickerbocker Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor The international squabble over climate change - who's to blame and how to deal with it - is coming to a boil as many of the major players prepare to meet in Germany next week. In essence, Europe and Japan want stricter controls on greenhouse gases and a faster timetable for reducing them. Major developing countries, China and India, say advanced Western industrialized nations need to make the first cuts; and the United States increasingly looks like the Lone Ranger as it resists diplomatic efforts to join in a coordinated plan to battle global warming. The differences became apparent earlier this week when the environmental group Greenpeace leaked documents "showing the United States has raised serious new objections to a proposed global warming declaration" for next week's Group of Eight summit, according to the French press service AFP. Germany is hosting the G-8 meeting in Heiligendamm June 6-8. The G-8 consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Britain, and the United States, with the 27-nation European Union (EU) participating as well. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to secure a major climate change deal, including agreement to slow the rise in average temperatures this century to 2 degrees Celsius, a cut in global greenhouse-gas emissions by 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and an increase in energy efficiency in power generation and transportation of 20 percent by 2020, the BBC reported. But the US has raised objections to a draft communique prepared for the summit, reports the BBC and other news sources, quoting documents first released by Greenpeace. "The changes strike out entire sentences and significantly reduce the certainty with which the statement addresses climate change," reports the BBC. In red ink, American negotiators wrote: "The US still has serious, fundamental concerns about this draft statement.... The treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses 'multiple red lines' in terms of what we simply cannot agree to.... We have tried to 'tread lightly' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the German position." China and India have joined the US in opposing strict international agreements to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Said Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, following a meeting this week with EU officials in Hamburg, Germany, as reported by AFP: "Our position is that we are a developing nation, and climate change is not the doing of developing countries, though every country has to do what it can to help the environment.... "China's greenhouse emission per capita is lower than in the developed world, and we still have a substantial number of people living below the poverty line, so we have to strike a balance between development and protecting the environment." China is not a member of the G-8 but was invited to the summit along with Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa. on the subject echo China's. Pradipto Ghosh, India's environment secretary, was quoted May 28 by the Press Trust of India news agency as saying "Legally mandated measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are likely to have significant adverse impacts on GDP growth of developing countries, including India. [Plans to cut greenhouse gases could also have] serious implications for our poverty-alleviation programs. This is not the path we want to pursue." African countries will not be directly involved in next week's G-8 discussions on global warming. But their interests are being voiced by Oxfam, the British aid and relief organization. Rich countries are obliged to help developing countries adapt to climate change, Oxfam asserts - an effort that could cost at least $50 billion a year, reported Britain's Financial Times. Said Oxfam senior researcher Kate Raworth: "This is not about aid, it is about the world's biggest and richest polluters covering the costs forced upon those who are most vulnerable.... Developing countries cannot and should not be expected to foot the bill for the impact of rich countries' emissions." Beginning with its rejection of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, the US has resisted international controls on its energy production and use - particularly as they relate to climate change. The US has aired two chief objections: that major developing countries (including China) are wrongly exempted from its targets and timetables for reducing greenhouse gases and that the Kyoto agreement would harm the US economy. US officials voiced those concerns this week in Darwin, Australia, where representatives of the 21 Pacific Rim countries making up the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum met to plan the group's summit in September, where climate change will be a key issue. Said US Deputy Secretary of Energy Clay Sell, as quoted by the Associated Press: "Each country brings its own unique circumstances, its own assets, its limitations.... A strong economy is the key enabler to addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions." Along with the US, Australia (the fourth-largest coal producer in the world) has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. At the Darwin meeting, the two countries said they want to discuss ways to develop clean technologies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions before any carbon-reduction schemes are considered. Said Australian Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane: "Once we know how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the challenge will then be to have those technologies employed and to set targets."
