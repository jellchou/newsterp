http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6707455.stm | Freed Chinese panda dies in wild GMT 12:11 Chinese panda dies in wild Xiang Xiang was released into Sichuan's forests in April 2006 The first Chinese panda released into the wild after being bred in captivity has died, Chinese media has announced. Xiang Xiang was released in April 2006 from the Wolong Giant Panda Research Centre and was said to be adjusting well to his new life. But the five-year-old was found dead in February. Officials said his death was likely due to a fight with wild pandas. Xiang Xiang's death is a set back for China's efforts to increase the number of giant pandas in the wild. Giant pandas are one of the world's most endangered species. Only about 1,600 remain in the wild, with another 200 living in captivity. Before his release, Xiang Xiang spent three years in a special training compound at the research centre in Sichuan province to prepare him for a natural habitat. Last year, experts there said he appeared to be integrating into the area's wild panda population. The lessons we have learnt from what happened to Xiang Xiang will help us adapt and improve the project But he was briefly taken back to the centre in December for treatment after a fight with other pandas. "We chose Xiang Xiang because we thought that a strong male panda would have a better chance of surviving in the harsh natural environment," Xinhua news agency quoted the reserve's deputy director Li Desheng as saying. "But the other male pandas clearly saw Xiang Xiang as a threat." Officials suggested that Xiang Xiang, whose injuries included broken ribs, had fallen from a high place after a fight with other pandas over food or territory. Zhang Hemin, head of the centre, said that they would continue to release pandas into the wild. "We are all sad about Xiang Xiang, but it doesn't mean the project has failed," he said. "The lessons we have learnt from what happened to Xiang Xiang will help us adapt and improve the project." The delay in reporting Xiang Xiang's death was because of the need for a full investigation, Xinhua quoted officials as saying.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6692805.stm | From Our Own Correspondent | Did this man kill Litvinenko? 26 May 2007, 10:33 GMT 11:33 this man kill Litvinenko? Andrei Lugovoi has said the charges are "politically motivated" As Britain seeks the extradition of former KGB-agent Andrei Lugovoi, the chief suspect in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, our correspondent goes to meet the man who continues to protest his innocence. The first time I met Andrei Lugovoi in his Moscow office he offered me a cup of tea. I hesitated. He laughed. Lugovoi was relaxed, amused by my discomfort, not at all on the defensive. A month later I met him again, this time at a petrol station on the Moscow ring road. He jumped out of his large Toyota four wheel drive a cheeky grin on his face. "How are you?" he said reaching out to shake my hand. Andrei Lugovoi is quite a charmer, and quite a showman. Thick snow was still on the ground as we pulled up at his walled compound deep in the forest outside Moscow. We entered a large building that looked like a gymnasium. Inside stood a group of men in military fatigues with thick necks and close-cropped hair. Performing for the camera "How about some shooting?" suggested Mr Lugovoi. "This is the only private shooting range of its type in Moscow" he told me proudly. Guns and boxes of ammunition appeared on a large table. Quickly and silently the guns were loaded. The thick set men sprang in to action: running, crouching, firing, reloading. It was an impressive show. But what about Lugovoi himself. Would he perform for the camera? Andrei Lugovoi is a former KGB bodyguard, not an ex-spy "No problem," he said. He picked up a gun and proceeded to fire off round after round, pausing to reload, and then firing away again. It is not the sort of thing I would do if I were under investigation for murder. But then there are lots of things about Mr Lugovoi that do not make sense. For a start, Andrei Lugovoi is not an obvious assassin. Much of the Western media has dwelt on his background in the KGB, suggesting he is some kind of ex-spy. But Andrei Lugovoi has never been a spy. He is, and always has been, a bodyguard. The next peculiar thing about Mr Lugovoi is his list of friends and clients. If Mr Lugovoi is an agent of the Russian state, as some have suggested, then he keeps pretty strange company. His oldest client, the man who first hired him as a bodyguard after he left the KGB, is none other than Boris Berezovsky. For those who are not familiar with Mr Berezovsky, he is the Russian billionaire who was once close to President Vladimir Putin, but is now his most avowed critic and enemy. From his base in London he runs a vocal and visceral campaign against Putin's Kremlin. Mr Berezovsky was also the closest friend and benefactor of a certain Alexander Litvinenko. Alexander Litvinenko died in hospital from radiation poisoning On the very day that Andrei Lugovoi is accused of poisoning Litvinenko at the millennium hotel in London, he also went to visit Boris Berezovsky at his Mayfair office. The subject of their meeting? A contract for Mr Lugovoi to protect the billionaire's daughter. Andrei Lugovoi is, in other words, a man who was well trusted by both Mr Berezovsky and Alexander Litvinenko. Indeed Boris Berezovsky told British police that when he first heard that Lugovoi was suspected of Litvinenko's murder, he did not believe it. There seems little doubt that British police have compelling evidence pointing the finger directly at Andrei Lugovoi. Although it has not been made public, it is well known that the most crucial evidence is the trail of radioactive Polonium 210 that seems to have followed Mr Lugovoi across Europe and around London. It was even found on the seat he used while watching an Arsenal football match at the Emirates Stadium in London. Each time I have met Andrei Lugovoi I have asked him to explain the trail of Polonium. He has never been able to do so. But the one thing he has repeated insistently is that he had no motive to kill Litvinenko. "Why would he kill someone he was hoping to do business with? Why would he jeopardize his business operations that stretch from Moscow to London, to Tel Aviv?" It is a good question, and one I have no answer to. Another is how someone like Lugovoi could have got hold of Polonium 210. Even in Russia, it is not something you can get on the black market. Polonium is extremely rare, very expensive and very difficult to handle. In Moscow conspiracy theories abound about what really happened to Alexander Litvinenko. One of the latest, and most compelling goes something like this; Lugovoi and Litvinenko were working for the British secret service. At some point last year Andrei Lugovoi got caught and turned by Russia secret service agents. They then forced him to betray and ultimately to kill his friend. It is pretty far fetched, but then so is everything about the Litvinenko case. While the evidence may point towards Lugovoi as the killer, it seems highly improbable that he acted alone. Only one thing seems fairly certain, that we will never find out who really ordered the killing of Alexander Litvinenko.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6598995.stm | From Our Own Correspondent | Happy Birthday, cake GMT 11:15 of Austria's most famous cakes, the Sachertorte, is marking its 175th birthday this year. The chocolate cake brought fame and fortune to its creator, a 16-year-old apprentice chef, and once sparked a long and bitter legal battle between two of the capital's finest cake-makers. The original Sachertorte recipe is a well-kept secret "You have to understand, the Sachertorte is the aristocrat of Viennese cakes," an Austrian friend told me. We were sitting in the 19th Century splendours of the cafe at the Hotel Sacher in Vienna, with its red brocade wall paper and crystal chandeliers. On the marble table in front of me was a perfectly cut triangle of Sachertorte on a white porcelain plate - two layers of chocolate sponge spread thinly with apricot jam and covered with a thick, glazed, dark chocolate icing. On top of the cake was a round seal made of chocolate, with the words Hotel Sacher stamped on it and, at the side, an artistic swirl of unsweetened whipped cream. I paused, my fork poised over my plate, to ask my friend what she meant by aristocratic. "It is distinguished, but simple," she said. "It's made of the best ingredients but doesn't shout about its quality, not like one of those nouveau riche, over-the-top Black forest gateaux. Just look at how smooth the icing is." Sachertorte, along with apple strudel, is one of the best-loved Austrian cakes. It is available almost everywhere, from greasy spoon railway cafeterias to the elegant coffee houses of Vienna and Salzburg. Champagne goes very well with Sachertorte Elisabeth Gurtler, Hotel Sacher I have been offered Sachertorte in apres-ski bars in the mountains, at birthday parties and at election rallies. In fact the cake has even been used as an ambassador for Austria. When the country was under European Union sanctions in the year 2000, because a far right party had joined the government, Vienna sent its foreign minister and a huge Sachertorte to an EU summit in an attempt to sweeten tempers. This year there seems to be even more Sachertorte around than usual because the cake is celebrating its 175th birthday. It was created by chance one day in 1832 when the chef to the chancellor, Prince Wensel Metternich, suddenly fell ill. Hotel Sacher was involved in a legal battle with Cafe Demel until 1965 His 16-year-old apprentice, Franz Sacher, was called in to create a dessert that would not disgrace the prince and the Sachertorte was born. A few days ago I attended a small birthday party for the cake at the Hotel Sacher, which was founded by Franz Sacher's son, Eduard. The managing director Elisabeth Gurtler was running around ensuring that the guests of honour were supplied with sparkling wine. "Champagne goes very well with Sachertorte," she told me. "Where do you keep Franz Sacher's recipe?" I asked. "It is in my safe," she said. "Only a handful of people have seen it and they are sworn to secrecy. There is only one original Sachertorte... and it is ours." Over the decades, the Hotel Sacher has spent years in court fighting for its claim that it makes the original Sachertorte. Its most prominent rival was the Cafe Demel, another famous Viennese pastry-maker. The Hotel Sacher eventually won. In the marble kitchens of the Cafe Demel, I watched the head confectioner, Dietmar Muthenthaler, spread melted chocolate on a slab of Sachertorte. "What is the difference between a Demel Sachertorte and one from the Hotel Sacher?" I asked. "I can't tell you exactly," he said. "But the Sacher says it uses three types of chocolate for the icing and we use just one, our own special brand of chocolate." It has been a long time since I first tasted Sachertorte and I can't remember now whether it was at Cafe Demel or at the Hotel Sacher. I was always forced to the same conclusion: Sachertorte looks better than it tastes But I do remember being distinctly disappointed. The cake was dry. The fabled chocolate icing was too sugary and curiously sharp in flavour. It wasn't unpleasant but I had been expecting something different, something richer, more along the lines of an American brownie. It just wasn't chocolaty enough. After that I did give the cake a chance, trying it out in a number of Austrian cafes. But I was always forced to the same conclusion: Sachertorte looks better than it tastes. And so I stopped ordering it, until one winter's day when I took refuge from the cold in an old smoky cafe in the centre of Vienna. The waiter came over to take my order for coffee. "Do you have any cake?" I asked. "It's home-made," he said, "and we haven't got anything else." "All right, then," I said, "bring me a Sachertorte." He returned with my coffee and a piece of dark chocolate cake. I tasted it cautiously. It was delicious. The sponge had been made with ground hazelnuts and lots of melted chocolate, which gave it a moist, rich texture. The icing was light and creamy with a strong charge of cocoa. The thin layer of apricot jam gave the cake a subtle tang. I had finally discovered the secret of the Sachertorte. It needs to be home-made with extra chocolate. But I have to confess, I still prefer apple strudel. From Our Own Correspondent was broadcast on Thursday 31 May, 2007 at 1100 GMT on BBC Radio 4.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6707643.stm East | Many killed in Iraq suicide bomb GMT 12:14 killed in Iraq suicide bomb At least 20 people have been killed in a suicide bombing at a police recruitment centre in the Iraqi city of Falluja, police say. Dozens more people were wounded in the attack, which occurred at about 1100 (0700 GMT). Falluja lies west of Baghdad in Anbar province, an area that has seen heavy fighting between US and Iraqi forces and Sunni Arab insurgents. Police recruitment centres have been a regular target of insurgent attacks. Police said the bomber was wearing an explosives vest and had passed through several checkpoints when the device was detonated among a crowd of police recruits, the Associated Press news agency said. Ten policemen are reported to have been killed. The police recruitment centre had only opened on Saturday as a result of co-operation between US and Iraqi forces and a grouping of Sunni Arab tribes called the Anbar Salvation Council. The tribes joined together last year in an attempt to fight al-Qaeda forces in Anbar province. The province is one of the key battlegrounds in the insurgency, say correspondents, and pacifying it is one of the toughest challenges facing US and Iraqi forces. the latest breaking news delivered to your desktop or mobile device THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ Sadr aide denies Britons kidnap Houses raided after Iraq kidnap US warns Iran over arming Iraqis Iraq car bomb kills at least 20 Leading Muslim calligrapher shot US Democrats criticised of turning their back on voters over Iraq war bill Iraq's war reaches the arts world Students brave the bombs Iraq 'facing grim future' Baghdad: Mapping the violence Iraq violence, in figures Baker's sweet smell of success Your views: Iraq four years on TV reports on Iraq TOP MIDDLE EAST STORIES Hezbollah condemns Hariri court Many killed in Iraq suicide bomb Nuclear watchdog's attack warning

The so-called Quartet of the US, Russia, the UN and the EU said "everything necessary" must be done to bring about Mr Johnston's release. Palestinian officials have said he is alive and safe and that they are doing all they can to obtain his release. Mr Johnston, 45, was seized nearly 12 weeks ago in Gaza City on his way home. Speaking after a meeting in Berlin, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon read a statement from the Quartet expressing its deep concern over the recent factional violence in Gaza. The Quartet "called upon the Palestinian Authority government in co-operation with [Palestinian Authority] President [Mahmoud] Abbas and regional actors to do everything necessary to restore law and order, including the release of kidnapped BBC journalist Alan Johnston." Palestinian government spokesman Ghazi Hamad has said that Mr Johnston is alive, safe and could be freed soon. More than 100,000 people have written to the BBC to demand Alan Johnston's release Send messages of support Despite the assurances, there has been virtually no official news about Mr Johnston since his disappearance. He was the only Western reporter permanently based in Gaza and his abduction has triggered appeals for his release from lawmakers and rights groups around the world. More than 100,000 people have now signed an online petition calling for his release. Earlier this month, Mr Johnston was named broadcast journalist of the year by the London Press Club for his work reporting from the Gaza Strip. The BBC has been featuring special reports and interviews with friends and family in the hope that Mr Johnston may access them on radio or television. marks Alan Johnston birthday UK Palestinians in Johnston plea Iran condemns Johnston's kidnap BBC's Johnston wins press award Alan Johnston: Your messages Use your blog to support Alan Johnston - here's how Sign the online petition To our own correspondent, Alan Alan Johnston on the front line Living with risk in Gaza TOP MIDDLE EAST STORIES Hezbollah condemns Hariri court Many killed in Iraq suicide bomb Nuclear watchdog's attack warning
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/europe/6707865.stm | GMT 13:37 prisons hold hundreds of people serving life sentences Hundreds of prisoners serving life sentences in Italy have called on President Giorgio Napolitano to bring back the death penalty. Their request was published as a letter in the daily newspaper La Repubblica. Italy has almost 1,300 prisoners serving life terms, of whom 200 have served more than 20 years. Italy has been at the forefront of the fight against capital punishment and recently lobbied the UN Security Council to table a moratorium on it. But at home some of the country's longest serving prisoners want the death penalty re-introduced. The letter they sent to President Napolitano came from a convicted mobster, Carmelo Musumeci, a 52-year-old who has been in prison for 17 years. It was co-signed by 310 of his fellow lifers. Musumeci said he was tired of dying a little bit every day. We want to die just once, he said, and "we are asking for our life sentence to be changed to a death sentence". It was a candid letter written by a man who, from within his cell, has tried hard to change his life. He has passed his high school exams and now has a degree in law. But his sentence, he says, has transformed the light into shadows. He told the president his future was the same as his past, killing the present and removing every hope. Italy abolished the death penalty after World War II. Under current laws, prisoners serving life can obtain the right to brief periods of release after 10 years and conditional release after 26 years of good conduct. The Communist Refoundation party's senator, Maria Luisa Boccia, has proposed draft legislation to abolish the life sentence and replace it with a maximum sentence of 30 years. The president has spoken many times about the need to change the sentencing regime. But in his response to the letter, he said it was now for parliament and the government to deal with the prisoners' request.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6707105.stm | State of emergency ends in Fiji GMT 09:34 of emergency ends in Fiji Mr Bainimarama has retained some powers to curb dissent Fiji's military leader says he will lift a state of emergency which he imposed on the Pacific nation after seizing power in December 2006. In a televised address, Commodore Frank Bainimarama said the order would end at midnight on Thursday (1200 GMT). But other orders including media curbs and restrictions on public gatherings would remain in place, he said. The Fijian leader has been under increasing international pressure to speed up the return to democracy. Cmdr Bainimarama seized control of the country in a bloodless coup on 5 December 2006, taking power from elected Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. He accused Mr Qarase of corruption, and was angered by his plan to offer an amnesty to those responsible for a 2000 coup which he had helped put down. Cmdr Bainimarama said that the regulations - which were extended several times - had been in place to ensure safety for civilians and their property. "It was required to move the country forward peacefully," he said. But he warned that those who threatened public order would still face police action. His coup has faced opposition both at home and abroad, with economic, diplomatic and defence sanctions imposed by Australia, New Zealand, Britain and the United States. The European Union had linked the provision of aid to an end to the state of emergency. There is also intense pressure on Cmdr Bainimarama to set a timetable for a quick return to democracy. The military leader says he will hold general elections, but not until around 2010.

She said women needed such rights to be able to choose how to balance tradition with empowerment in their societies. Ms Rice was speaking at a conference in Vienna which has been examining the contribution women can make to peace efforts in the Middle East. Attending the meeting are a number of prominent women from the region. It's absolutely the case that unless women are fully participants of their societies, these societies cannot really be fully democratic These include the Israeli foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, Palestinian MP Hanan Ashrawi, the wife of the Iraqi president, Hira Talabani, and Sheikha Haya Rashed al-Khalifa, the outgoing Bahraini president of the UN General Assembly. "It's absolutely the case that unless women are fully participants of their societies, these societies cannot really be fully democratic, and that is something we're absolutely devoted to," Ms Rice said. The participants at the conference are meeting behind closed doors for a discussion entitled Women Leaders - Networking for Peace and Security in the Middle East. Hosting the meeting, Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik said those attending had no illusions about the problems in the volatile region and would not shy away from talking frankly about its "open wounds". "We have no illusions about the obstacles still facing us, nor about the urgency for action," she said.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6707333.stm | US arrests internet 'spam king' GMT 11:49 arrests internet 'spam king' Mr Soloway allegedly sent millions of e-mails on hijacked computers A man nicknamed the "spam king" for allegedly sending out millions of junk e-mails has been arrested in the US. Robert Soloway, 27, was arrested in Seattle, Washington, after being indicted on charges of mail fraud, identity theft and money laundering. Mr Soloway has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Prosecutors say Mr Soloway became one of the world's biggest spammers, using computers secretly infected with orders to send out millions of his e-mails. Such computers are known as "zombies" because their owners often have no idea they have been hijacked for another purpose. According to prosecutors, Mr Soloway was responsible for tens of millions of unsolicited e-mails promoting his own company between November 2003 and May 2007. He is said to have frequently changed the web address of his internet marketing business to avoid being caught. A US lawyer said Mr Soloway was the first person to be prosecuted for sending out spam e-mails using federal laws against identity theft. Prosecutors want to seize the sum of $773,000 (£391,000) that Mr Soloway is said to have made from his firm. If convicted of all the charges, he also faces a fine of $250,000 (£126,500) and a maximum prison term of 65 years. plunder Plusnet e-mail 22 US crackdown on market spammers 09 Mar 07 | Business Spam surge drives net crime spree 26 Dec 06 | Technology Anatomy of a spam e-mail 11 Oct 06 | Technology TV to show YouTube content US arrests internet 'spam king'
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/americas/6708609.stm | US actor will run for president GMT 16:05 actor will run for president Former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson is a successful actor Fred Thompson, a Hollywood actor and former senator, has said he intends to run for US president in 2008. The 64-year-old, who joins a crowded field of Republican contenders, told newspaper USA Today about his campaign plans, ending months of speculation. He is already well known for his role as a district attorney in TV series Law & Order, and has been polling well. Mr Thompson is expected to launch a "testing the waters" committee in the next few days to start fundraising. The former two-term senator for Tennessee has already been hiring staff, making speeches and setting up a strong internet presence. Reports began circulating on Wednesday that he had decided to make official his informal but already attention-grabbing initiatives towards running for president. "I can't remember exactly the point I said, 'I'm going to do this'," Mr Thompson told USA Today in an interview published on Thursday. "But when I did, that thing that occurred to me: 'I'm going to tell people that I'm thinking about it and see what kind of reaction I get to it'." Mr Thompson has already been attracting attention with speeches He told the paper that his late start to campaigning carried "certain advantages", not least that his use of the internet "has allowed me to be in the hunt, so to speak, without spending a dime". Observers say he could pose a threat to all three of the main contenders for the Republican nomination, Senator John McCain, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Some polls have put him at second or third place among potential Republican voters struggling to decide who to back in a field of almost a dozen candidates. He has strong conservative credentials on issues such as gun control and abortion and, while he voted in 2002 to authorise the Iraq invasion, he is not as closely associated with the war as some of his rivals. His charisma and ability to perform for the crowds are expected to stand him in good stead on the campaign trail. Inevitably, parallels have been drawn between Mr Thompson and another actor-turned-politician, Ronald Reagan. The actor has asked to leave Law & Order, where he has played the astute, fatherly New York District Attorney Arthur Branch for the past five seasons, in order to concentrate on politics. He is also known to viewers for roles in the films The Hunt for Red October, in which he played a US Navy admiral, Last Best Chance and In the Line of Fire.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/europe/6708459.stm | Russia blames US in missile row GMT 14:53 blames US in missile row Mr Putin said Russia's actions were not aggressive Russian President Vladimir Putin has said a recent ballistic missile test was in answer to US plans to create a defence shield in Central Europe. Mr Putin said it was a "response to maintain the strategic balance in the world", in what he called a "new round of the arms race". He added that Russia would continue to improve its resources. Russia tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile, which can be armed with up to 10 warheads, on Tuesday. These actions by Russia should not be feared, they are not aggressive Europe diary: Missile defence "Our American partners have left the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty," Mr Putin told a press conference. "We have warned them then that we will come out with a response to maintain the strategic balance in the world." Mr Putin defended Russia's actions, insisting they were not the "initiators of this new round of the arms race". "(Our partners) are stuffing Eastern Europe with new weapons," he said. "A new base in Bulgaria, another in Romania, a site in Poland, radar in the Czech Republic. What are we supposed to do? We cannot just observe all this." He added: "These actions by Russia should not be feared, they are not aggressive, it's just an answer to rather tough and unjustified unilateral actions by partners." Washington wants to deploy interceptor rockets in Poland and a radar base in the Czech Republic to counter what it describes as a potential threat from "rogue states" such as Iran and North Korea. The US maintains its system is not directed at the Russians, but Moscow says its security is being threatened. Russia's test launch took place at the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia on 29 May. The missile, called RS-24, was designed to evade missile defence systems, the Russian defence ministry says. The test missile successfully struck its target 5,500km (3,400 miles) away on the far eastern Kamchatka peninsula, the Russian Strategic Missile Forces said. diary: Missile defence 31 Russia tests long-range missile 29 Putin steps up missiles warning 27 Apr 07 | Europe Russia's treaty threat irks Nato 26 Apr 07 | Europe Russia upgrades nuclear missiles 05 Dec 06 | Europe Putin unveils 'new super missile' 31 Jan 06 | Europe blames US in missile row Turkish MPs force reform showdown

The 14th seed won 4-6 3-6 6-2 6-4 6-2 to book his place in the third round. Gaudio showed glimpses of the form which won him the title in 2004 as he took the first two sets, firing a series of spectacular backhand winners. But he wilted dramatically and Hewitt pounced, delivering an impressive 20 aces on his way to victory. Gaudio, 28, has hinted that this will be his last French Open and, after losing his way so spectacularly against Hewitt, he is unlikely to change his mind. Your thoughts on the action from Roland Garros The Argentine, now ranked 72 in the world after reaching a high of five, was cruising at two sets to love up but he never recovered from dropping serve at 1-1 in the third set - his three double faults gifting Hewitt the game. The Australian, who completed victory in three hours and 28 minutes, could face Rafael Nadal in the last 16 if he gets past Finland's Jarkko Nieminen in his next match. Elsewhere on Thursday, sixth seed needed four sets to see off the lowest ranked player in the tournament before making it into round three. The Serb won the first set against qualifier Laurent Recouderc fairly easily before the Frenchman won four games in a row to take the second set. Djokovic looked rattled but held his nerve to secure a 6-3 3-6 6-3 6-1 and for a place in the third round. His next opponent will be either Olivier Patience or Mariano Zabaleta.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/sport1/hi/football/6518647.stm BBC SPORT | Football | Blatter secures third Fifa term of the Day GMT 13:28 secures third Fifa term Blatter was first elected as Fifa president in 1998 Sepp Blatter will continue as Fifa president after standing as the only candidate for the post. No other candidate was put forward to challenge the 71-year-old, who was elected to office in June 1998 and is now expected to serve through to 2011. The Swiss succeeded Joao Havelange and won a bitter election against former Uefa president Lennart Johansson. And in 2002 Blatter saw off the challenge of Issa Hayatou, president of the African confederation Caf. "I am delighted to accept the 57th Fifa Congress's mandate to serve as president during the 2007-2011 period," he said. "I am very happy, and together we will oversee four years of continued strength for football." Blatter's second term lasted for five years rather than the usual four when Fifa decided not to end the president's term of office in the same year as the World Cup finals in Germany. Fifa had already confirmed that 66 member associations out of 207 from all six confederations nominated Blatter. At the time Blatter said: "I wish to thank all of the associations who have demonstrated their trust in me this way." And he promised: "During my third period of office, football will acquire a more pronounced and extensive social role. "Over the past nine years I have managed to overcome a range of difficulties and bring about several improvements, thanks to the help and support of members of the global football family." Blatter, the eighth president in Fifa's history, joined the organisation as technical director in 1975 and was general secretary from 1981 until 1998.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/south_asia/6706769.stm Asia | Thirteen die in Pakistan attack GMT 06:09 die in Pakistan attack At least 13 people have been killed after unidentified gunmen entered the house of a senior government official in north-western Pakistan, police say. The home of Amiruddin, government representative in the autonomous Khyber tribal area, was attacked with rockets and hand grenades in the early morning. Police say Mr Amiruddin survived but several of his relatives died. Tank is the gateway to the South Waziristan tribal region, where al-Qaeda and the Taleban are strong. District police officer Mumtaz Zareen said it would be "premature to name elements behind the attack". Reports quoted witnesses as saying that the gunmen had stormed the house and asked the people staying there about the official's whereabouts. When they did not find the official, they went on a shooting spree in the house, reports say. Last year, incursions by Taleban militants into Tank led to a total collapse of the civil administration in the district. The police there abandoned their posts, and banks have been told to arrange their own security. The BBC's Ilyas Khan, who visited Tank recently, says the situation in the southern districts of North West Frontier Province (NWFP) is unmistakably sliding into anarchy. Tank has been the worst hit, and is as good as lost to the militants, our correspondent says. the top judge became centre of political opposition The judge and democracy Profile: PM Shaukat Aziz The scientist who confessed The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites TOP SOUTH ASIA STORIES Taleban 'downed Nato helicopter' Nepal parties agree November poll Thirteen die in Pakistan attack
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6707499.stm | From Our Own Correspondent | Hezbollah's secret nectarines GMT 14:27 southern Lebanon, where the Israeli army and Hezbollah fighters fought last year, an uneasy peace reigns. But as Darius Bazargan reports, Hezbollah remains a force to be reckoned with. "Modern live/work space available to buy or rent: 400 sq metres in a sun drenched Mediterranean valley. Electricity, hot/cold running water, shower, fitted kitchen, air con, reinforced concrete construction, all metal walls, 100 metres under a mountain. Can withstand all known ordnance and most air strikes." If you are looking for a place in the sun with a difference, head for Lebanon. The south of this country is riddled with such des-res properties. Thursday 31 May 2007 1900 BST on BBC Two Inside a secret bunker They are the secret bunkers of Hezbollah, recently abandoned by the Shia Islamist guerrillas after last year's ceasefire took hold. You can find them in amongst the cluster bombs and debris of war. I spent many a sweaty day stumbling up and down the precarious slopes of Lebanese mountains, looking for such heavily disguised sites for a documentary I was filming. But where had all the fighters and their heavy weapons gone? With over 10,000 UN peacekeepers now patrolling the ground between the Israeli border and the Litani River, it has become increasingly difficult for the militants to operate in their old stamping ground. But I had heard that they were reinforcing a defensive line north of the Litani, just outside of the UN zone. From here, they could launch longer range rockets into Israel, over the heads of the peacekeepers. Dawoud Indahoud is a former Shia militiaman As we drove into the misty mountains, my trusty driver Dawoud - himself a Hezbollah supporter from south Beirut - regaled me with stories about how "The Party of God" dealt with espionage during last summer's war. "I don't know what equipment they had. But they caught these spies red-handed, put 'em up against a wall and shot the three," Dawoud said. We drove on in silence. "Killed 'em dead," he added. This was not what I needed to hear at the time. We were all alone in an extremely hostile environment. Live minefields spread out as far as the eye could see, the earth was also seeded with unexploded and unmapped cluster bombs. All across this region, mysterious activity. Bulldozers, diggers and cement mixers could be seen abandoned on hilltops, or by the roadsides, in the middle of nowhere - but no new buildings. There were fresh roads above us, but they were blocked off. Occasionally, cars packed with grim looking, black clad figures, sat guarding the entrances. All around, the Lebanese Army was manning roadblocks with an unusual alacrity, but leaving the final decision as to who they should let through to a number of other bearded gentlemen, also dressed in black and who carried Motorola walkie-talkies. Most locals were too apprehensive to do interviews, but one told us to be careful. "Hezbollah are everywhere," he said. "But you will not see them, they will see you." Another recounted how Hezbollah had restricted her family's movements on their own farmland. "The Boys", as she called them, had dumped several hundred tonnes of sand at the bottom of her garden and were shipping it out by truck. She had no idea where they were taking it or what they were doing. Sand is a vital ingredient for mixing concrete. And concrete is a vital ingredient if you are building underground bunkers. We drove down one of the new roads. What had started as a muddy cart track suddenly became a metalled road, with saplings planted on either side. Large tennis court-sized areas had been completely smoothed off and were followed by a number of squat concrete buildings, a sentry box and painted a sign declaring the area a security zone and Hezbollah territory. My driver panicked. In a grinding of gears he spun the vehicle around and got us out of there at high speed. But just as we thought we had made a lucky escape I saw a dark green truck approaching. I had pushed our luck too far. We got picked up and detained by a Hezbollah patrol. They made us an offer we could not refuse. We were to accompany them to the dingy looking farmhouse and they would find someone who could "help us to do even better filming." Inside the farmhouse were the rest of the Hezbollah cadre and we feared the worst. They did not shoot us though. They sat us down in front of a big yellow Hezbollah flag and offered us sweet tea. Hezbollah flags are flown all over southern Lebanon Then they questioned me and my driver and went through the tape in my video camera. It was blank. Luckily I had been able to swap it when they were not looking. The Hezbollah men told me that we were in a restricted military security zone, but admitted that Hezbollah had indeed been taking over the land in the area. "We are not forcing Christian or Druze off their land," one Hezbollahi insisted. "We're offering them a good price. They're moving of their own free will. Anyone can buy land here," he added, seemingly forgetting that it was a strict military zone. But what to do with their surprise guests? One man favoured formally arresting us and calling Hezbollah security agents from Beirut. Others said we were clearly a pair of nervous hacks, not spies, and just to let us go. Thankfully the latter argument prevailed. Flushed with relief, we walked back to our car. But as we were about to drive off, the strangest thing happened. One of the Hezbollah men came running up and insisted that I had to tell the truth about what the Party of God's activities are in those forbidding mountains. Hezbollah were not building new bunker networks, missile bases or anything military, he said. They were, in fact, moving into fruit production. "We are going to import nectarine plants from Italy," he said. "Then we will sell our fruits on the world market. It is most important you tell the world what we are doing." I told him absolutely, yes, of course, I would tell everyone all about the nectarines if I could just go now. Please? It was completely unprofessional of me. But I was in such a hurry to get home safely, that I forgot to ask him whether or not Hezbollah's nectarines were going to be grown organically.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/europe/6706921.stm | GMT 11:56 Lugovoi said he had been made a scapegoat The man suspected of poisoning ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko has said it could not have happened without the involvement of British secret services. Andrei Lugovoi, who denies killing Mr Litvinenko, told a Moscow news conference that he was a scapegoat. Mr Lugovoi said MI6 had recruited Mr Litvinenko and had also tried to recruit him, to collect information on Russian President Vladimir Putin. The UK said the matter was a criminal rather than an intelligence matter. "A British citizen was killed in London and UK citizens and visitors were put at risk," a Foreign Office spokesman said. KEY EVENTS IN CASE Alexander Litvinenko meets Andrei Lugovoi and another Russian at a London hotel Litvinenko dies in a London hospital A Litvinenko statement accuses Russian President Vladimir Putin of involvement in his death. Experts say Litvinenko was poisoned UK police say they are treating the death as murder Lugovoi should be charged with Litvinenko's murder, British prosecutors say UK makes formal request for Lugovoi's extradition from Russia Full timeline of events The UK has requested Mr Lugovoi's extradition in connection with the crime. But the Russian constitution forbids it from extraditing its own citizens. Mr Litvinenko died in November 2006 after exposure to the radioactive isotope polonium-210. Polonium-210 was found in a string of places that Mr Lugovoi visited in London, but he said he was a witness, not a suspect in the case. A former KGB officer and British agent, Oleg Gordievsky, described Mr Lugovoi's claims as "silly fantasies". He denied Mr Litvinenko had been working for the British secret services. "He used to be... a member of the FSB, it is a domestic organisation of the KGB, and MI6 is not interested in information about the domestic service, so Litvinenko was not needed," he told BBC News. Mr Lugovoi, himself an ex-KGB agent, said the poisoning could not have happened without some involvement from the British intelligence services. "Even if [British special services] hadn't done it itself, it was done under its control or connivance," he said. Asked if he had evidence of this, Mr Lugovoi said he did, without giving further details. Sasha [Litvinenko] was not my enemy Mr Lugovoi said that either British foreign intelligence agency MI6, the Russian mafia, or fugitive Kremlin opponent Boris Berezovsky were behind the killing. Mr Lugovoi said that, like Mr Litvinenko, Mr Berezovsky was working for the British secret services, but that the two men had a falling out and that MI6 could no longer control Mr Litvinenko. Mr Berezovsky, who has been granted asylum in Britain, has denied any involvement in Mr Litvinenko's death. On Thursday, Mr Berezovsky said that it was now "clearer than ever" that the Kremlin was behind the murder. "Everything about Mr Lugovoi's words and presentation made it obvious that he is acting on Kremlin instruction. If Mr Lugovoi would like to prove his innocence, I suggest again that he travel to London and face trial in the UK courts," he said in a statement. Mr Lugovoi said he was "openly recruited as the British security service agent. They asked me to collect any... compromising information about President Putin and the members of his family". He said he was initially asked to find economic information, but he said the large fees he was paid made him realise he was being recruited to do more than that. He went on to say that he lacked the motive to kill Mr Litvinenko. "Sasha [Litvinenko] was not my enemy. I didn't feel cold or hot from whatever he was doing, from the books that he was writing. I've been in business for a long time and I was not really interested," he said. Mr Lugovoi also spoke about Russians who managed to get British passports by working for special services. The British public, he said, should know what certain Russians were doing in London.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/business/6708875.stm | Russia denies foreign energy bias GMT 16:13 denies foreign energy bias Uncertainty surrounds foreign investment in Russian energy Russia does not discriminate against foreign firms in its pursuit of its energy needs, a key minister has said. Critics have accused Moscow of strong-arming firms such as Shell and BP to secure Russian influence over key oil and gas projects. But energy minister Viktor Khristenko said it treated both Russian and foreign firms "exactly the same". Separately, the EU's energy chief said the bloc was not threatened by the growth of Russian energy firm Gazprom. Russia provides a quarter of the EU's gas supplies but energy commissioner Andris Piebalgs said he did not believe Gazprom - its largest firm - exerted too much influence. Regular disputes between Russia and its neighbours over gas exports have led critics to accuse Moscow of using its huge energy resources as an economic and political weapon. Gazprom is very strong but I would not say too strong Andris Piebalgs, EU Energy Commissioner Shell's sale of its stake in the Sakhalin-2 project to Gazprom after pressure from Russian regulators and the prospect of BP having its licence for the Kovytka gas field - operated under a joint venture - withdrawn have made the status of foreign firms in Russia uncertain. ExxonMobil, the world's largest oil firm, recently said Moscow needed to clarify its attitude to foreign investment before it would consider further projects there. But Mr Khristenko told an energy conference that foreign firms were not being persecuted. "Our approach to foreign and domestic investors is exactly the same," he said. "Accusations floating in the air carry more risks for the participants on this global process than on the process itself." He said Gazprom would base its assessment on whether to become involved in the Kovytka project purely on its technological merits. Speaking at the same event, Mr Piebalgs said Russia was not casting a shadow over Europe's energy market despite its huge market share. "Gazprom is very strong but I would not say too strong," he noted. "The EU market is really functioning, so Gazprom has never been big enough to be a real challenge for us." As part of an overhaul of its energy policy, the EU is proposing to force firms to split up their generation and distribution functions - a move which some experts say is partly designed to keep Gazprom's growth in check. But Mr Piebalgs said its planned reforms were "not working against Russia".

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/africa/6708277.stm | Nigeria militants set conditions GMT 14:13 militants set conditions The militants' activities have led a 25% cut in oil production The main militant group in Nigeria's Niger Delta says it is willing to stop its violent campaign only if the new government frees its jailed kinsmen. Newly sworn-in President Umaru Yar'Adua has said the crisis in the oil-rich region will be his priority and has called for a ceasefire. But the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta said he must show "genuine willingness" for dialogue. The government must prepare for more violence if it fails to act, Mend said. The militants have waged a sabotage campaign for more than a year in the under-developed region, including kidnapping dozens of foreign oil workers. The shadowy militants in Nigeria's Delta Mend said that people were tired of words and wanted urgent action to end their impoverishment. "Only time will tell if Mr Yar'Adua is not just another politician," Mend leader Jomo Gbomo said in an email to the media. "The most important requirement of the Niger Delta people is justice. Genuine negotiations towards a just resolution are sufficient hope for the people of the Delta." Although Nigeria's oil money comes from the Niger Delta, the majority of the region's people remain deeply impoverished. The activities of the militants have led to a more than 25% cut in oil production. Criminal gangs in the region have used similar tactics to obtain ransoms for the release of captives.
