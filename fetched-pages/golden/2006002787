Edwards for $6.8B Thursday, May 31, 2007 NEW YORK &#151; Wachovia Corp. ( ), the fourth-largest U.S. bank, Thursday said it will buy for $6.8 billion in cash and stock, creating the second-largest U.S. retail brokerage. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia expects to fold A.G. Edwards into its Wachovia Securities brokerage, pushing deeper into metropolitan areas. The combined brokerage would have about 14,784 brokers, ranking behind Merrill Lynch & Co. ; and $1.15 trillion of client assets, ranking third behind Merrill and Citigroup Inc., Wachovia said. It would employ more than 31,000 people, and command a 14 percent market share. "Long-term growth opportunities of the brokerage industry are extremely compelling to Wachovia," Wachovia Chief Executive Ken Thompson said in a statement. "This combination ... will further enhance our scale and relevance." A.G. Edwards shareholders will receive 0.9844 of a Wachovia share and $35.80 in cash for each of their shares. The terms value A.G. Edwards at $89.50 per share, a 16 percent premium over their Wednesday closing price. A.G. Edwards shares had already risen 22 percent this year. The transaction comes nearly eight months after Wachovia completed the $24.2 billion purchase of U.S. savings and loan Golden West Financial Corp. "(We) see significant cost savings as well as opportunities for Wachovia to overlay its broader product set," wrote Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Jason Goldberg. "The purchase also reduces its mortgage contribution (to overall results)." Wachovia has 8,166 brokers and $773 billion of client assets. A.G. Edwards, founded in 1887, has 6,618 brokers and $374 billion of client assets. The combined brokerage would keep its name and be based in St. Louis, home of A.G. Edwards. Prudential Financial Inc. has a 38 percent stake in Wachovia Securities, and said it supports the merger. Wachovia Securities Chief Executive Daniel Ludeman will retain his title, while A.G. Edwards Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Bagby will be chairman. Bagby, reached at his St. Louis office, said he could not comment. Wachovia expects $395 million of cost savings, or 10 percent of combined expenses, and to incur $860 million of merger charges over 18 months. It expects the transaction to boost earnings per share excluding items in the first year, and generate a 24 percent internal rate of return. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Credit Suisse, Wachovia Securities and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP represented Wachovia on the transaction, while Goldman Sachs & Co. and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz represented A.G. Edwards. Wachovia shares closed Wednesday at $54.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The combined firm will have an enhanced share of the U.S. brokerage market with significantly increased penetration in 48 of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas.

Based on Wachovia's share price at the close of business on May 30, 2007, the deal values the St. Louis, Missouri-based A .G. Edwards at $89.50 per share, which represents 16% premium to A .G. Edwards' Wednesday's closing price of $77.15. The combined organization is expected to achieve annual expense efficiencies of $395 million by 2009, accounting for 10% of the combined firm's most recent fiscal year-end expense base. The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Wachovia's earnings per share, excluding items, in the first full year, following the closing. The transaction also provides an internal rate of return of 24%, far exceeding Wachovia's cost of capital. The merger, subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2007. Meanwhile, the full integration is expected to be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2009. In connection with the deal, Wachovia expects to record charges and exit cost purchase accounting adjustments of about $860 million over the 18-month integration period. Commenting on the deal, Ken Thompson, Wachovia's chairman and CEO, said, "The long-term growth opportunities of the brokerage industry are extremely compelling to Wachovia. This combination with A.G. Edwards, which is widely considered one of the most highly regarded remaining independent brokerage firms in the industry, will further enhance our scale and relevance." The merged entity, which would be headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, will have 3,350 brokerage locations, offering objective advice to clients based on research from multiple providers. A.G. Edwards will come under Wachovia Securities, LLC. The combined retail brokerage organization will be Other A.G. Edwards businesses including research, underwriting and investment banking, mutual funds and trust.

Meanwhile, A.G. Edwards' Chairman and CEO Robert Bagby will become the chairman of the combined brokerage firm. Wachovia Securities reports to David Carroll, president of Wachovia Corp.'s Capital Management Group. Caroll stated, “As consolidation continues in the brokerage industry, the opportunity to combine with a premier firm like A.G. Edwards was a rare chance to solidify our leadership in the industry with the scope and resources required to be the firm of choice for clients and for quality financial advisors.” Carroll noted that Wachovia is known for its success and expertise in integrations, including six brokerage firms since 1998, of which the joint venture with Prudential Securities was the largest. John Strangfeld, vice chairman of Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU), which currently owns 38% of Wachovia Securities, said, "We believe the combination of A.G. Edwards and Wachovia Securities is highly attractive and takes the business to a new level of prominence and promise. We have complete confidence in management's ability to make this deal successful."

Tello said the lawsuit was filed at the Tampa Courts on May 29. Odyssey announced two week ago it had discovered a shipwreck it has codenamed “Black Swan” and 500,000 gold and silver coins somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. They only described the ship as a 17th-century merchant vessel that sank about 40 miles off the south-western tip of Cornwall. But the Florida-based company would not say exactly where the ship was or name it, citing security concerns. © Thomas Crosbie Media, 2007.

The cases involve the alleged mistreatment of Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian citizen, in July 2002 and January 2004; Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen, in May 2002; and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian citizen, in December 2001, ACLU officials said. Mohamed is currently being held in Guant&#225;namo Bay, Cuba; Britel in Morocco and Agiza in Egypt, the ACLU said in a statement. The three have claimed through their family and lawyers that they have been tortured and abused against universally accepted legal standards. Their attorneys appealed to the ACLU for assistance. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in California, charges that flight services provided by Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc. enabled the clandestine transportation of the men to secret overseas locations, where they were tortured and subjected to other "forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment." Mike Pound, a spokesman for Jeppesen, said company officials had not yet seen the lawsuit and had no immediate comment. Bush urges 15 major countries set global emission goal by 2008 Zoellick has new agenda for World Bank Bush calls on Congress to increase funds for fighting AIDS He said Jeppesen provides support services, rather than the flights themselves, for airlines, private pilots and companies. "We don&#039;t know the purpose of the trip for which we do a flight plan," he said. "We don&#039;t need to know specific details. It&#039;s the customer&#039;s business, and we do the business that we are contracted for. It&#039;s not our practice to ever inquire about the purpose of a trip." Boeing itself is not named in the lawsuit and would not confirm the reports of a Jeppesen-CIA link, said spokesman Tim Neale, adding that customers have a confidentiality clause. "Either (Jeppesen) knew or reasonably should have known that they were facilitating a torture program," ACLU attorney Ben Wizner said. Companies "are not allowed to have their head in the sand, and take money from the CIA to fly people, hooded and shackled, to foreign countries to be tortured," said Wizner. Neither the CIA nor the U.S. government is named in the lawsuit. Wizner said the executive branch has evoked a state secrets defense in similar lawsuits. The lawsuit says Jeppesen "furnished essential flight and logistical support to aircraft used by the CIA to transfer terror suspects to secret detention and interrogation facilities in countries such as Morocco and Egypt where, according to the U.S. Department of State, the use of torture is &#039;routine,&#039; as well as to U.S.-run detention facilities overseas, where the United States government maintains that the safeguards of U.S. law do not apply." The Bush administration has insisted it receives guarantees from countries receiving terror suspects that prisoners will not be tortured. The ACLU said its lawsuit was being filed under the Alien Tort Statute, which permits aliens to bring claims in the United States for violations of the law of nations or a United States treaty.

http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/murdoch-spends-327m-in-web-spree/2007/05/31/1180205425165.html&cid Murdoch spends $327m in web spree - Business - Business - smh.com.au Welcome to The Sydney Morning Herald. Murdoch spends $327m in web spree NEWS CORP'S internet division has plunged further into the fast-growing world of amateur video, buying two young companies for a combined $US270 million ($327 million). Fox Interactive Media spent about $US250 million for Photobucket, which draws more than 30 million monthly visitors who view and store billions of digital photographs, videos and slideshows. News Corp also spent more than $US20 million for little-known Flektor, which offers free tools for editing and displaying online videos. Both companies' services are aimed at people who post web profiles on social-networking sites including Fox Interactive's prize property, MySpace. In the short term, Fox expects the purchases to help it capture more web surfers and keep their attention for longer. Like MySpace, both Photobucket and Flektor are set up to make most of their money through advertising. But Fox also hopes to push the creative products to News Corp's broader audience, Fox Interactive president Peter Levinsohn said. That could foster an increase in user-submitted content across the company's stable of internet properties, including AmericanIdol.com and video-game fan site IGN.com. In one potential use, Mr Levinsohn said, a high school sports fan could record a local game and then post it to FoxSports.com. The idea also could extend to local news footage. "We now control the single busiest social media site, the single biggest personal media destination, and what I think is the coolest set of tools that exist today," Mr Levinsohn said, referring to MySpace, Photobucket and Flektor respectively. "And we will take it to another level." Gartner analyst Mike McGuire said the Flektor tools could help fuel political expression. A citizen commentator could take a video clip from a debate and add their thoughts, then post the combination to MySpace or Google's YouTube. Mr McGuire said News Corp now appeared to be doing the best job of any "old media" company in staying abreast, or even ahead, of what consumers want to do with videos and photos. "Consumers are now in absolute control of how they want to access media and program media," Mr McGuire said. "Having these properties on top of MySpace, which we can almost view as a platform, is very smart." The deals were announced the same day that CBS confirmed its own jump into social networking with the $U280 million purchase of Last.fm, a site organised around sharing musical preferences. The new-media buyout spree this week also saw dominant online auction firm EBay announcing the $US75 million acquisition of StumbleUpon, a site with more than 2 million users who recommend internet pages, including those within social networks, for people to visit. For now, Denver-based Photobucket and Culver City, California-based Flektor will operate independently within Fox Interactive. The executives at both closely held firms will stay at Fox, and they can earn more from the sales if they meet performance targets. The Flektor and Photobucket services will continue to function on sites that compete with MySpace, Fox says. The Photobucket deal consummates what had been a stormy relationship. Taking note of how many MySpace users turned to Photobucket to manage their pictures, Fox Interactive for months had considered bidding for the company. Flektor was started by video-game industry veterans just a year ago. send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today Murdoch spends $327m in web spree Place a classified ad Copyright &#169; 2007.

Prosecutors did not say why they dropped the count, but evidently believed the evidence presented by the government over more than 10 weeks of trial thus far might not support a conviction. Former media mogul Conrad Black arrives at federal court in Chicago, Wednesday. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) Federal spokesman Randall Samborn said he would have no comment on the decision, which came with no fanfare while jurors were out of the courtroom and a number of issues were being discussed by the judge and attorneys. "At this time the prosecution rests," Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Sussman told U.S. District Judge Amy St. Eve, ending the government's case against Black. Attorneys for the beleaguered former press lord and three co-defendants were scheduled to begin calling witnesses Thursday in what is expected to be a much less time-consuming case for the defence. Black, 62, and three other former executives of Hollinger International are charged with swindling the newspaper holding company out of millions of dollars through the sale of Hollinger assets. The alleged scheme began with a decision in the late 1990s by Black, who was the company's chairman, to sell hundreds of small Hollinger-owned community newspapers across the United States and Canada. Millions of dollars were paid to Hollinger in exchange for promises that it wouldn't go into competition with the new owners of the papers. Prosecutors say Black and two of his co-defendants, former Hollinger vice presidents John Boultbee and Peter Atkinson, illegally diverted much of the money to themselves with help from corporate counsel Mark Kipnis. Kipnis also is on trial. All four of the defendants maintain that they did nothing illegal. The prosecution rested its case amid bickering over 13 boxes Black removed from the company's headquarters in Toronto late in the afternoon of May 20, 2005, in defiance of a court order. Jurors on Wednesday saw pictures captured by security cameras of the former Hollinger CEO hauling the boxes out of the headquarters building and loading them into a waiting limousine that promptly whisked them away. Black, who is charged with obstruction of justice in the incident, was forced to return the boxes, which sat on an evidence cart next to the jury box while the jurors viewed the security camera photos on a large screen. After jurors had gone home Wednesday, Black defence attorney Marc Martin argued that the obstruction count should be thrown out along with the money-laundering count because there was no proof of wrongdoing. "We don't know what Mr. Black's intention was," Martin said. He said no harm was done because Black eventually returned the boxes intact. But Sussman argued that the obstruction of justice was blatant and that Black had defied not only a Canadian court order but an American court and a federal grand jury before finally returning the boxes. "We will probably never know what Mr. Black took - we do know what Mr. Black returned," Sussman told St. Eve. St. Eve gave both sides until June 5 to file briefs expanding on their arguments. Martin said he would ask her to drop other counts, as well. Earlier, while jurors were still eating lunch, debate among the attorneys returned to the recurring theme of how much of Black's flamboyant rhetoric and obvious zest for the finer things in life should be allowed into evidence. St. Eve barred Sussman from reading to jurors one sentence from a memo that Black wrote when he was criticized by shareholders for using the Hollinger corporate jet for a vacation on Bora Bora in French Polynesia. She did allow Sussman to read this portion to jurors: "We have to find a balance between an unfair taxation on the company and a reasonable treatment of the founder-builder-managers. We are proprietors, after all, beleaguered though we may be." But she said this portion would pose too much danger of prejudicing the jury: "I'm not prepared to re-enact the French revolutionary renunciation of the rights of the nobility." &copy; The Canadian Press, 2007 Solid economic growth in Q1 adds to loonie's rise The Canadian economy grew at a slightly better than expected annual rate of 3.7 per cent through the first three months of the year â€” news that helped push the loonie higher.

Agrees to Buy Photobucket and Flektor - New York Times A Unit of News Corp. Agrees to Buy Photobucket and Flektor Sign In to E-Mail or Save This By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Published: May 31, 2007 Fox Interactive Media, a unit of the , has agreed to acquire the photo-storage site Photobucket, just weeks after a public spat in which the popular networking site MySpace partly blocked content from Photobucket. MySpace, which is also owned by the News Corporation, lifted the block after about two weeks, but both sides have been silent on the details of their peacemaking. Separately, Fox also agreed to buy Flektor Inc., which offers Web-based tools for creating slide shows, recombined videos and other interactive presentations. Financial terms of the two deals were not disclosed. MySpace users often embed third-party photos, video and other material in their personal profile pages, and sites like Photobucket and YouTube, ’s video-sharing site, make that easy by providing the programming code to cut and paste into MySpace pages. The practice has made Photobucket one of the leading sites on the Internet, even though relatively few users access content directly through its home page. MySpace blocked Photobucket in April, after complaining that the hosting service had been encouraging users to incorporate an ad-supported slide show into their MySpace profiles. MySpace said the slide show violated its policies banning unauthorized commercial activity. Photobucket’s chief executive, Alex Welch, responded by accusing MySpace of limiting free expression and treating users as a commodity. He was more conciliatory two weeks later, saying the two had “established open lines of communication and procedures,” but he made no mention of negotiations over a sale of his company.

http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/eBay-buys-online-search-site-StumbleUpon/2007/05/31/1180205385474.html&cid eBay buys online search site StumbleUpon - Breaking News - World - Breaking News Welcome to The Age. eBay buys online search site StumbleUpon May 31, 2007 - 10:19AM Online auction house eBay has acquired StumbleUpon, a software startup that suggests websites based on reader reviews and personal preferences of its members. The $US75 million ($A91.2 million) cash acquisition gives eBay access to about 2.3 million people who have filled out profiles at StumbleUpon, founded in 2001 by three Canadian software engineers in Calgary. The venture capital-funded company, which recently relocated to San Francisco, is considered a pioneer of the so-called Web 3.0 niche. The term refers to technology that pairs general internet search capability with a user's personal data and aggregated community data, theoretically delivering more relevant results than a standard search engine such as Google. For example, a StumbleUpon search for "cars" could generate a list of web pages that factor in a user's income, age, gender, home address, current vehicles owned and other demographic data submitted. The search results would also include sites ranked favourably by other StumbleUpon members with similar interests and background. By contrast, a straight Google search delivers 357 million web pages ranging from the popular Hollywood movie Cars to advertisements for used car dealers and newspaper classified sections. StumbleUpon is free for users and generates revenue through advertising, though the company doesn't disclose financial information. Members who pay an annual fee bypass advertisements completely. Michael Buhr, senior director at San Jose-based eBay, will serve as general manager of StumbleUpon. StumbleUpons founders and managers will become eBay employees. "StumbleUpon is a great fit within our goal of pioneering new communities based on commerce and sustained by trust," Buhr said. The acquisition is not expected to change eBay's latest financial guidance. The company expects to report second-quarter profit of 31 to 33 US cents per share on sales in the range of $US1.75 billion to $US1.8 billion ($A2.1 billion to $A2.19 billion). For the full year, eBay expects profit of $US1.30 to $US1.34 per share on sales of $US7.2 billion to $US7.45 billion ($A8.8 billion to $A9.1 billion). The 12-year-old e-commerce powerhouse had $US3.5 billion ($A4.3 billion) in cash last month and has been aggressively acquiring smaller companies to compete against rivals ranging from Google to Amazon.com. EBay, which already owns internet phone service Skype and portals such as Shopping.com and Rent.com, completed the buyout of online ticket reseller StubHub for $US310 million ($A377.1 million) earlier this year.

IBM lays off another 1,500 workers May 31, 2007 - 6:59AM IBM has laid off 1,570 people primarily from an ongoing overhaul of operations in its giant technology services unit. The Armonk, New York-based company carried out a similar level of job cuts at the beginning of the month, for a total of 3,023 in this quarter and 3,720 for the year, according to IBM spokesman Edward Barbini. That amounts to roughly one per cent of the company, which employed 355,000 people at the beginning of the year. But even these small numbers reflect a big project inside IBM to transform its business. Services is IBM's biggest division by revenue, but the advent of lower-cost competition overseas has forced IBM to work harder to improve the unit's profit margins. In the first quarter, pretax income for IBM's tech services fell 19 per cent, even as revenue rose seven per cent. Wednesday's job cuts were largely part of the company's response. Although IBM did not disclose where the layoffs were being made, the company had blamed the first-quarter profit shortfall on problems in its US outsourcing business. IBM executives say they expect no more layoffs this quarter. But other shifts like this - IBM calls it "rebalancing" - figure to follow from time to time. That's because IBM's services overhaul not only involves cheaper labour - IBM's work force in India rose from 9,000 in 2003 to 52,000 last year - but also a quest to use less labour. That means rethinking and sometimes automating the ways that services contracts are carried out. Last year, IBM adopted a business-retooling system known as Lean last year to find such opportunities. Robert Moffat, the IBM executive overseeing Lean, acknowledges it will reduce the need for some services labour, but he contends that it will also create new work for the company overall because customers will be getting more for their money. send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today 15 killed in Yemen petrol station strike Missile test response to US moves: Putin Police to charge man over stabbing IBM lays off another 1,500 workers Place a classified ad Copyright &#169; 2007.

Terms of the deals were not disclosed. Earlier, a source familiar with the talks said the Photobucket deal was worth about $250 million. A separate source said on Wednesday the Flektor deal was worth about $20 million. Which phone company plans to use Microsoft's new Surface computer? Test Your Knowledge -- More Questions Resources for anyone who runs a small business or wants to start one. Small Business on the Net Save & Share Article The two purchases are part of News Corp.'s plan to bolster its Internet businesses, which are expected to generate about $500 million this fiscal year, and about $1 billion in 2008. Photobucket lets its more than 42 million users upload photos and videos, which can be pasted on their own Web sites, blogs and social networks like MySpace. Some 40 percent of its users have already posted their content on MySpace. Culver City, California-based Flektor offers easy-to-use software tools to manipulate photos and videos. Fox Interactive President Peter Levinsohn said in a telephone interview he saw Flektor's technology being used across other News Corp.-owned Internet services, including AmericanIdol.com and games-related IGN. "If you combine MySpace, the largest social networking platform in the U.S., and Photobucket, the preeminent personal media destination, we feel like we've got a fantastic package of assets that differentiates us in the marketplace," Levinsohn said. The long-anticipated Photobucket deal comes after a high profile but short-lived flap between the two companies. MySpace blocked photos from Photobucket when Photobucket began displaying ads in photo windows that appeared on MySpace. Fox executives said the Photobucket had run afoul of MySpace's terms of service agreement that forbids companies from the unauthorized commercial use of the service. Levinsohn said Fox has been reviewing its terms of services agreement to explore relaxing current rules regarding third-party commercial use, amid far smaller rival Facebook's move to allow so-called widget companies to profit from its service. "The fact that they're (Facebook) enabling them (third party widget companies) to sell ads is something we're looking at and have been looking at," Levinsohn said. "Do I think at some point we will change that? We're looking at it every day to try to come up with the right solution." Far fewer number of users are on Facebook, which up until last September was closed to regular users, who did not attend college. But it has embarked on an aggressive expansion plan and last week announced 65 partnerships to allow widget companies that create software to run on other services like MySpace and Facebook to begin building and profiting from Web applications for Facebook. Photobucket serves about 3.5 billion images each day across the Internet. Users of the service upload about 50,000 new videos per day, similar to MySpace user statistics, Levinsohn said. The deal "confirms our position as easily the No. 2 player in the online video space," he said, behind Google Inc.'s Photobucket will be operated as a standalone site and continue to serve some 300,000 other Web sites.

Lee Partners LP and insurance provider Fidelity National Financial Inc. in a cash deal valued at about $5.3 billion. Under the terms of the deal, Ceridian shareholders will receive $36 for each share they own. The deal represents a 5.3 percent premium over Ceridian's closing price on Wednesday and a 17 percent premium over its closing price Feb. 12, the last trading day before the company announced it was looking into strategic options. "We believe these firms bring complementary skills which will help us build upon our leadership position as we continue to implement our strategic plan," said Kathryn V. Marinello, president and chief executive, in a statement. Ceridian announced that it was looking into strategic options after the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management LP pressured the company to spin off its fast-growing Comdata division, writing to the company's board that it was concerned the division would be worth more as a stand-alone company. Comdata issues and process credit and gift cards. Investors have also been hoping that Ceridian could make its human resources business more profitable. Ceridian, in its statement, said the Comdata division was kept in mind as the board evaluated several strategic alternatives. Fidelity National Chairman and Chief Executive William P. Foley II cited Ceridian's position in large, growing markets and its strong cash flow, among other factors, in explaining Fidelity's interest in the company. "We are very excited about our investment in Ceridian," he said. THL Partners and Fidelity National said they expect to bring co-investors into the transaction. Fidelity National will own less than 50 percent of Ceridian at closing. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Shares of Ceridian -- based in the Twin Cities suburb of Bloomington -- rose 47 cents to $34.19 in regular trading. In aftermarket activity, they added another $1.41, or 4.1 percent, to $35.60. The stock has ranged from $21.76 to $35.35 over the past year. Fidelity National shares rose 57 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $27.57, then lost 7 cents after hours. Earlier Wednesday, shares traded at a new 52-week high of $27.59. (Copyright 2007 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)

Within the last 15 minutes, the Chicago PMI rose to 61.7 in May from 52.9 in April, easily topping the consensus estimate of 54.0. A number above 50 reflects growth and the data raise hopes that tomorrow's more influential national ISM survey will also show strength. The report's growth indication is helping to offset earlier data that showed the economy grew at only a 0.6% rate in Q1. That signaled the weakest expansion in more than four years; but the first quarter is long over and yesterday's FOMC Minutes suggested the economy is picking up steam. whenever this page is updated go to Try the Best for FREE!

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070531.wblacktor31/BNStory/ConradBlack/home&cid reportonbusiness.com: Prosecutors drop laundering charge against Black Letters to the Editor Prosecutors drop laundering charge against Black Defence lawyers to begin their cases From Thursday's Globe and Mail May 31, 2007 at 3:56 AM EDT &#151; Prosecutors ended their case against Conrad Black yesterday by withdrawing one criminal charge and showing the jury more examples of Lord Black's lavish lifestyle and colourful language. &#34;At this time, the government rests,&#34; lead prosecutor Eric Sussman told the court in mid-afternoon, ending more than two months of witness testimony, legal arguments and document presentation, all aimed at persuading jurors that Lord Black should go to prison. Just before that, Mr. Sussman withdrew a money-laundering charge against Lord Black. The charge was among the most serious Lord Black faced and it had been added to the indictment with great fanfare by prosecutors, along with racketeering, in December of 2005. The charge related to agreements struck when Hollinger International Inc. sold most of its Canadian newspapers to CanWest Global Communications Corp. in 2000 for $3.2-billion. In that transaction, $80-million was set aside to cover payments under non-competition agreements CanWest signed with Lord Black and three other Hollinger executives. Lord Black and David Radler, who pleaded guilty, each received about $18-million. Former National Post editor to testify Black trial sees video of box removal Assistant could be defence's first witness Conrad Black trial loses another juror Black trial nearing end 'Dear Donald, Could I ask a rather esoteric favor? &hellip;' How Black built his empire');"> How Black built his empire When Lord Black and the others were charged, prosecutors alleged all of the non-competition payments should have gone to Hollinger. Shortly after the trial began, prosecutors conceded that the payments to Lord Black and Mr. Radler were legal but they said Lord Black still faced charges for arranging non-competes for defendants Peter Atkinson and John Boultbee. The money-laundering charge, which relates to the wiring of Lord Black's non-compete funds, only applied to Lord Black and it related directly to the CanWest deal. Mr. Sussman and lawyers for Lord Black declined to comment. Lord Black still faces several charges of fraud, racketeering and tax evasion stemming from non-competition agreements in other Hollinger deals. Prosecutors ended their case yesterday the way they began it, by showing the jury some of Lord Black's e-mails. In an e-mail sent to a Hollinger director, Lord Black referred to a shareholder revolt over the non-competition payments as &#34;regrettable nonsense.&#34; A later e-mail to Mr. Atkinson called the company a &#34;vehicle for extracting money as in the non competes.&#34; Prosecutors also gave the jury a glimpse into Lord Black's personal life yesterday by showing some of the items he stuffed into 13 boxes that he carted out of his Toronto office on May 20, 2005. Prosecutors have alleged Lord Black was obstructing justice by removing the boxes, but Lord Black has insisted he was only taking personal items. He returned the boxes within days. Prosecutor Jeffrey Cramer showed the jury several bank statements found in the boxes. The statement indicated that Lord Black purchased a $2.6-million, 26-carat diamond ring from Graff Diamond Ltd. The bank records also showed Lord Black spent $116,000 at Yves St. Laurent, $150,000 at a book dealer, and $101,000 at Fendi. In court filings, prosecutors have alleged Lord Black used Hollinger money to pay for many personal expenses. The expenses and e-mails will likely figure prominently when prosecutors make their closing arguments. For weeks, prosecutors have tried to use these sorts of documents to illustrate Lord Black's disdain for shareholders and his sense of entitlement. &#34;Mr. Black believes this is his company and he is above the shareholders,&#34; Mr. Sussman said yesterday during a hearing without the jury present. Much of the prosecution case also rests on whether the jury finds their witnesses credible. Many of the high-profile prosecution witnesses, such as former Illinois governor James Thompson, former ambassador Richard Burt and economist Marie-Jos&#233;e Kravis, faced rough cross-examinations that dented their credibility. All three acknowledged they did not read key company documents. Mr. Radler also faced gruelling questioning about past lies and whether he reached a plea agreement to save himself. Prosecutors will likely try to draw the jury back to some of their first witnesses, who faced fewer challenges. Those witnesses included several men who bought newspapers from Hollinger and who testified that they did not want non-competition agreements with Lord Black and the others. One of the buyers, Michael Reed, told the jury that he refused to wire payments to Lord Black and the others. Defence lawyers will begin presenting their cases today. They are expected to take about two weeks in total and there is little indication that Lord Black or any of the others will testify.

Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Economy nearly stalled in first quarter By JEANNINE AVERSA AP Economics Writer Article Launched: 05/31/2007 05:33:19 AM PDT Click photo to enlarge Shoppers stroll along New York's Fifth Ave., Tuesday, May 29, 2007. Consumer confidence bounced back unexpectedly in May, despite higher gasoline prices that could raise shoppers' worries about inflation, the Conference Board said Tuesday. WASHINGTON- The economy nearly stalled in the first quarter with growth slowing to a pace of just 0.6 percent. That was the worst three-month showing in over four years. The new reading on the gross domestic product, released by the Commerce Department Thursday, showed that economic growth in the January-through-March quarter was much weaker. Government statisticians slashed by more than half their first estimate of a 1.3 percent growth rate for the quarter. The main culprits for the downgrade: the bloated trade deficit and businesses cutting investment in supplies of the goods they hold in inventories. "We are still keeping our head above water&mdash;barely," said economist Ken Mayland of ClearView Economics. For nearly a year, the economy has been enduring a stretch of subpar economic growth due mostly to a sharp housing slump. That in turn has made some businesses act more cautiously in their spending and investing. The economy's 0.6 percent growth rate in the opening quarter of this year marked a big loss of momentum from the 2.5 percent pace logged in the final quarter of last year. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke doesn't believe the economy will slide into recession this year, nor do Bush administration officials. But ex-Fed chief Alan Greenspan has put the odds at one in three. On Wall Street, investors took the weak GDP showing in stride. The Dow Jones industrials were up 22 points and the Nasdaq gained 14 points in morning trading. The first-quarter's performance was the weakest since the final quarter of 2002, when the economy was recovering from a recession. At that time, GDP eked out a 0.2 percent growth rate. Economists were predicting the first-quarter performance this year would be downgraded, but not as much as it did. They were calling for a 0.8 percent pace. GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced in the United States. It is considered the best measure of the country's economic fitness. In other economic news, the Labor Department reported that fewer people signed up for unemployment benefits last week. New filings dropped by 4,000 to 310,000. That suggests the employment climate is weathering well the economy's sluggish spell. Another report showed that construction spending edged up by 0.1 percent in April, down from a 0.6 percent gain in the previous month. Spending by private builders on nonresidential projects and spending by the government on big projects each climbed to all time highs in April but that strength was tempered by continued weakness in residential construction. In the GDP report, many economists believe the first quarter will be the low point for this year. They expect growth will improve but still be sluggish. The National Association for Business Economics predicts the economy will expand at a 2.3 percent pace in the April-to-June quarter. In the first quarter, there was a larger trade deficit than first thought. That ended up shaving a full percentage point from the GDP. Businesses cut back on inventory investment as they tried to make sure unsold stocks of goods didn't get out of whack with customer demand. That lopped off nearly a percentage point to first quarter GDP. Those were the biggest factors behind the government slicing its initial GDP estimate released a month ago by as much as it did. The sour housing market also restrained overall economic activity. Investment in home building was cut by 15.4 percent, on an annualized basis, in the first quarter. However, that wasn't as deep a cut as the 17 percent annualized drop initially estimated. And, it wasn't as severe as the 19.8 percent annualized drop seen in the final quarter of last year. Even so, there is no doubt that troubled housing market is one of the biggest problems for the economy. Although some businesses tightened the belt in the first quarter, consumers did not. That helped to prevent the economy from stalling out altogether. Consumers boosted their spending by a 4.4 percent growth rate in the first quarter, the most in a year. Consumer spending accounts for a major chunk of economic activity. Some economists wonder how much interest consumers will have in continued brisk spending, however, given rising gasoline prices that have topped $3 a gallon in many markets. More money spent filling up the gas tank leaves less to spend on other things. One of the reasons consumers have stayed so resilient even as the housing market has been stuck in a rut for a year is because the job market has been good. Employers&mdash;still enjoying profits&mdash;are keeping a close watch on spending but they are not drastically clamping down on hiring. Companies profits gained a bit of ground in the first quarter. One measure showed after tax profits rising by 1 percent, up from 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter. An inflation gauge tied to the GDP report and closely watched by the Fed showed that core prices&mdash;excluding food and energy&mdash;rose at a rate of 2.2 percent in the first quarter. That was unchanged from an initial estimate but up from a 1.8 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The Federal Reserve's key interest rate has been at 5.25 percent for nearly a year. Many economists predict the rate probably will stay right where it is through the rest of this year.

None of the 15 shareholder proposals that were up for approval at the annual meeting received 50 percent of the shareholder vote, but four dealing with pay and governance received at least 40 percent. All four measures would increase the accountability of Exxon's management and board for their policies and performance. About 47.8 percent of the voting shareholders backed a measure that would give holders of 10 percent of Exxon's outstanding common shares the right to call special shareholder meetings and 47.2 percent favored a proposal to allow the company to recoup incentive bonuses it determined not to be justified. Proposals to give shareholders an advisory vote on executive pay and to split the chief executive and chairman positions got 41.2 percent and 40 percent of the vote, respectively. But climate change was the central topic of discussion at the meeting and one environmental proposal -- that the company adopt goals for greenhouse gas reductions from its products and operations -- received 31 percent of the shareholder vote. Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson disputed claims by investor activists and environmentalists that the company is working to mislead the public about the causes of climate change. "What I find perplexing is why people feel threatened because we want to have a discussion," Tillerson said, when offering an explanation for why the company funds some groups that are skeptical of the mainstream scientific views of climate change. "I'm not going to just adopt a slogan. If that makes me public enemy number one, so be it," he said. Investors also voted in all 12 nominees to Exxon's board, including Michael Boskin, who received 93 percent of the vote despite an effort by a group of investors to unseat him in protest of the company's climate policy. PROTESTS OUTSIDE, INSIDE MEETING About three dozen protesters -- outnumbered by police -- staged a peaceful demonstration outside the meeting against the company's funding of groups they believe deny or distort the science of global warming. The protesters waved banners with slogans like "People Before Profits" and chanted "No More Junk Science." "Exxon Mobil is double-crossing the public and policy makers. It's avoiding real changes and continuing to fund groups that purposefully distort the science of global warming," said Shawnee Hoover, the campaign director of Exxpose Exxon, a coalition of green and scientific groups. They say the company still funds about 40 organizations that the environmental group classified as "global warming deniers," shelling out over $2 million to the groups in 2006. Exxon disagrees with the claim that the groups, many of which concern themselves with a wide range of issues, are "deniers of climate change." Exxon has said man-made greenhouse gas emissions could be a source of global warming, while arguing that climate science is still uncertain. Most scientists believe the use of fossil fuels causes global warming. Shareholder activists inside the meeting also took advantage of the opportunity to air their grievances about Exxon's environmental record. "Can you imagine what would happen if the largest company in the world stood up and took a leadership position" on climate change, Sister Patricia Daly, a Dominican nun, asked Tillerson. "We are challenged by one of the most profound moral concerns and we have the wherewithal to respond," she said. Tillerson generally listened quietly as the shareholder proposals were presented, but became more lively as he disputed criticism of his company during the question and answer period that followed. He said Exxon would continue to fund scientific research on climate change so the company can understand it better. He also addressed claims that the company's environmental policy would leave it at a financial disadvantage to its peers who have already made more concessions on the issue. "If that makes us not Shell -- well, based on my results, I'm kind of glad we are not Shell," he said, referring to competitor Royal Dutch Shell. (c) Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

After nearly 3 months government rests, leaving doubts about strength of its case By Ameet Sachdev and Susan Chandler Published May 31, 2007 Eleven weeks into the federal fraud trial of Conrad Black and three other former Hollinger International Inc. executives, the prosecution rested Wednesday. The defense starts Thursday. The case against Black, an international media baron, was a guaranteed sensation because of its colorful plot line: A rich and powerful publisher with a jet-setting lifestyle, an outsize personality and a glamorous wife, accused of looting the company he built from scratch almost 40 years ago. While living mainly in Canada and named a lord in Britain, Black had a significant Chicago footprint: Hollinger International, now known as Sun-Times Media Group Inc., is based here and owns the Chicago Sun-Times. But testimony, while focusing at times on a lavish New York dinner and a trip to Bora Bora, is exceedingly complex, presenting prosecutors with a difficult challenge of proving wrongdoing. It has been a marathon for jurors, who have endured days of tedious testimony from auditors and outside attorneys who advised the company about whether $60 million in so-called non-compete payments to Hollinger's top executives had to be disclosed to shareholders. They also listened to prominent Hollinger directors, including former Illinois Gov. James Thompson, who said they were kept in the dark about the payments. But the directors couldn't explain how they had missed repeated written disclosures of the non-competes that were included in documents they were supposed to review. The biggest showdown was the appearance of Black's longtime No. 2, now the government's star witness, former Hollinger President F. David Radler. He presented crucial testimony about Black orchestrating a scheme to steal money from the company, but he also confessed to being a serial liar. Despite his legal troubles, Black has maintained his high profile, giving interviews about his new biography of Richard Nixon and speaking out about his innocence on the courthouse steps to reporters. His co-defendants, John Boultbee, Peter Atkinson and Mark Kipnis, have been overshadowed by Black's persona and performance. The Tribune asked Hugh Totten, a Perkins Coie attorney who has been observing the trial, and Steven Skurka, a Canadian legal analyst who has been writing a Conrad Black blog, to offer their thoughts on how the prosecution fared. THE WITNESS AND HIS TESTIMONY F. David Radler, former president and chief operating officer He is the star witness because he is the only senior executive charged who has pleaded guilty in exchange for a reduced sentence. Black's longtime business partner testified that during their phone conversations Black came up with a "template" to divert money from the company. He also said he kept the board's audit committee in the dark about the non-compete payments. Defense lawyers attacked his credibility, pointing out numerous times he lied before he cut a deal with prosecutors. The defense's assault went on for the better part of six days, and Radler frequently challenged questions, prompting rebukes from the judge. "Once again the only evidence we have of this private telephone call is your word?" asked Edward Greenspan, one of Black's lawyers. "That's correct," Radler replied. "Your word. Your word is the word of a liar," Greenspan said. "That's your interpretation," Radler answered. Radler may not have come across as an honest guy, but he buttressed the prosecution's argument that he and Black conspired to line their own pockets at the expense of shareholders, Totten said. It was disappointing that there is no smoking-gun documents to back up Radler's testimony. "I think he did what he needed to do, but there's no question he was a beaten man by the time he left the stand," Totten said. THE WITNESS AND HIS TESTIMONY Paul Healy, former vice president of investor relations His testimony established that there was something fishy about the New York apartment Black bought in 2000 from Hollinger for $3 million, the same price the company paid for the home six years earlier. Healy also described Black's disdain for activist shareholders who were questioning the non-compete payments. In audio recordings introduced through Healy, jurors heard Black fend off angry investors at two shareholder meetings. Healy testified under a grant of immunity. In an e-mail exchange between Healy and Black, Black dismissed complaints from Laura Jereski, an analyst at one of Hollinger's largest shareholders: "Laura's letter is nonsense, but obviously a number of shareholders are holding hands on this," he told Healy. "Much as I would like to just blow &#091;them&#093; off, I don't want a sour atmosphere at the shareholder meeting." Healy's portrayal as a corporate governance crusader took some hits as the defense showed sycophantic e-mails he sent to Black. The prosecution also did not call any shareholders to bolster Healy's testimony. But a real estate expert did support Healy's statement that Black did not pay fair market value for the apartment. "There's just nothing compelling enough about Healy's testimony to convict somebody," Totten said. THE WITNESS AND HIS TESTIMONY James Thompson, four-time governor of Illinois and chairman of Hollinger International's three-person audit committee Thompson testified that he was never informed about non-compete payments to Hollinger executives other than in the sale to CanWest of Hollinger's Canadian newspapers. Because the non-competes were "related party" transactions, they should have been brought to the attention of the audit committee. But Thompson also admitted he had missed written disclosures of the payments in numerous Hollinger financial statements and regulatory filings that were sent to him because he had "skimmed" the documents. "Yes, I should have read them word for word. I didn't. I skimmed them," Thompson said under cross-examination. "When you're skimming a document, you don't see everything in every paragraph," Black's lawyer Edward Greenspan shot back. "You were taught this? Is there some kind of skimming school?" Thompson did not help the prosecution, and he actually created confusion. He could not explain how he missed repeated written disclosures of the non-compete payments, sticking to the contention that "skimming" the documents didn't mean he was negligent in his duty to look out for Hollinger shareholders. In walking that tightrope, "Thompson became his own worst enemy," Totten said. By the time Thompson's cross-examination was over, "His credibility was in tatters," Skurka said.

All four worked in a group set up by the company in 1998 to develop tax shelters, according to an indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. They allegedly defrauded the Internal Revenue Service from 1998 through 2004 by designing, marketing and selling fraudulent tax shelters. U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said in a statement that the indictment targets "tax professionals whose deceit costs this country untold millions in tax revenues." An Ernst & Young spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment. It was not immediately known who would represent the four men at court appearances later Wednesday. The indictment said the partners knew that if the IRS detected use of the tax shelters by their clients, it would aggressively challenge the claimed tax benefits. To hide the tax fraud from the IRS, the defendants created documents containing false and fraudulent descriptions of the clients' motivations for entering into the transactions, the indictment said. The partners enticed clients to participate in the shelters by getting law firms to provide letters claiming that the tax shelter losses or deductions would "more likely than not" survive IRS challenge, the court papers said. The four knew the opinions were based on false and fraudulent statements but believed they would undermine the ability of the IRS to determine the clients' tax liabilities and decide whether penalties should be imposed, according to the indictment. The partners were seeking entry into the highly lucrative tax shelter market that was already being explored by other companies, the indictment said. Those charged were identified as Robert Coplan, 54, a Plano, Texas, lawyer who once was a branch chief in the IRS' Legislation and Regulations Division; Martin Nissenbaum, 51, of Brooklyn, a lawyer; Richard Shapiro, 58, of Rye Brook, N.Y., also a lawyer, and an accountant, Brian Vaughn, 39, of Calhoun, La. They were charged with conspiracy to defraud the IRS, tax evasion, making false statements and impeding and impairing the lawful functioning of the IRS. Copyright 2007 Associated Press.

Northwest used its 20 months in bankruptcy to carve $2.4 billion, or 20 percent, from its annual expenses. It slashed labor spending by $1.4 billion, or 40 percent. The fifth-largest U.S. airline also reorganized regional flights, trimmed its fleet by 13 percent, and replaced older fuel-guzzling planes. ``They were pretty aggressive,&#39;&#39; said William Warlick, a Fitch Inc. analyst in Chicago. ``The proof is in the pudding, and they&#39;re going to come out of bankruptcy with lower costs than virtually all other legacy carriers.&#39;&#39; The reorganization will produce a $794 million profit in 2007 after last year&#39;s $2.84 billion loss, Northwest estimates. Last quarter&#39;s operating profit margin was 7 percent, the best among major U.S. airlines. AMR Corp.&#39;s American Airlines was second with a 4.6 percent margin. Northwest, based in Eagan, Minnesota, was the last of four large U.S. airlines to file for bankruptcy after air travel slumped in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks. US Airways Group Inc., filed in August 2002 and again in September 2004; UAL Corp.&#39;s United Airlines in December 2002; and Delta Air Lines Inc. about 30 minutes before Northwest on Sept. 14, 2005. Northwest lost $4.62 billion from 2001 through 2005, and listed debt of $17.9 billion in its filing. ``They had the benefit of being the last through,&#39;&#39; said Robert Mann of R.W. Mann & Co., a Port Washington, New York- based consultant for airlines and labor groups. ``On that basis, they were able to work off everyone else&#39;s set of objectives.&#39;&#39; Before the filing, Chief Executive Officer Doug Steenland hired two lieutenants with a bankruptcy background at US Airways. Chief Financial Officer Neal Cohen joined four months before the bankruptcy, and Controller David Davis came aboard five days beforehand. ``They had a lot of experience and a lot to draw on in negotiating tough deals with labor groups and vendors,&#39;&#39; Warlick said. With ``relatively good&#39;&#39; non-labor costs, the airline focused on paring personnel expenses, said analyst Philip Baggaley of Standard & Poor&#39;s in New York. Steenland and his executives trimmed the workforce by 22 percent from June 30, 2005, to 30,008 employees as of March 31. They also pushed through reductions in salary, vacation time, sick leave, health-care benefits and crew meals and accommodations. The new, lower-cost union contracts run for five to six years, providing savings for a longer period than competitors&#39; wage agreements, Northwest said. ``These guys are as tough as they come,&#39;&#39; said Darryl Jenkins, an independent airline industry consultant in Marshall, Virginia. Excluding fuel, Northwest cut its cost to fly each seat one mile to 7.7 cents last year, from 8.9 cents before it filed for bankruptcy. That compared with 7.4 cents at Delta and 9.1 cents at United, according to Northwest. Unlike Delta, which exited bankruptcy April 30 after shifting jets to international routes, Northwest didn&#39;t have to change strategy. It already had a larger share of higher-profit overseas flights than most peers. About 41 percent of Northwest&#39;s capacity last year was on international routes, second only to the 47 percent of Continental Airlines Inc., according to Cathay Financial Inc. analyst Susan Donofrio in New York. The lack of an ``open skies&#39;&#39; agreement between China and the U.S. means Northwest and United will keep their edge in Pacific passenger traffic before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, said Roger King, a debt analyst for New York-based CreditSights Inc. ``They have a pretty nice asset in the Pacific and fly along the northern tier of the U.S., which means they have less low-cost carrier competition,&#39;&#39; King said. To further trim expenses and ferry passengers to U.S. hubs including Minneapolis and Detroit, Northwest started one new regional carrier, Compass Airlines, and bought another, Mesaba Airlines. It cut its fleet to 375 planes as of March 31, compared with 433 in mid-2005, including replacing all 15 DC-10s with newer jets to save on maintenance and fuel. The reorganization didn&#39;t help labor relations. Flight attendants rejected two tentative agreements for $195 million in concessions before approving a third this week, with 51 percent voting in support. The attendants and unions for pilots and other employees have criticized the carrier&#39;s plans to distribute $297 million in shares to Steenland and other managers. Northwest&#39;s unsecured creditors will get 236 million of the carrier&#39;s new shares, of a total of 263.8 million that the carrier plans to issue. The shares rose 68 cents to $25.18 at 9:58 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, valuing the creditors&#39; equity stake at $5.94 billion. Northwest&#39;s plan to sell $750 million in new shares beyond the stock distributed to creditors ``will bolster their balance sheet and cash further,&#39;&#39; S&P&#39;s Baggaley said. ``That&#39;s a move the other bankrupt airlines have not taken.&#39;&#39; To contact the reporter on this story: Susanna Ray in Chicago at Last Updated: May 31, 2007 10:04 EDT Related Media on Demand Neidl of Calyon Sees Northwest as `Tough Competitor&#39; Wachovia to Buy A.G.

The lay-offs bring to about 3,700 the number of jobs IBM has cut this year in its services unit, which accounts for about half of total revenue but whose profit lags the company's software business. Earlier this month, IBM eliminated about 1,300 jobs in the U.S. services business. The rest were cut in the first quarter. IBM, which had 355,766 employees at the end of 2006, said on April 17 it was cutting costs in the United States amid weaker U.S. demand for its services and products in the first quarter. IBM spokesman John Bukovinsky said he did not have information showing where Wednesday's job cuts took place. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, is trying to boost profitability in services by replacing some employees with software that can be replicated from one contract to another. This year's job cuts occurred as customers shortened or otherwise cut services contracts, Bukovinsky said. "The services business is tremendously cyclical," he said. "This is basically the result of (clients) looking over longer-term contracts and deciding they don't want the work done, or deciding they can do the work with fewer people." Bukovinsky said the jobs were not being shifted to lower-cost labor markets such as India. IBM in the first quarter paid about $55 million for job cuts. (c) Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

May 31 2007: 6:09 AM EDT SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -- Yahoo Inc. Chief Technology Officer Farzad Nazem is retiring from the Web portal and search company after 11 years, effective June 8, the company and Nazem said. His departure leaves two key posts empty at ) after the company restructured last year to better compete with Web search leader Fortune's David Kirkpatrick sits down with CNNMoney's Jim Ledbetter to discuss the possibility of a Yahoo-Microsoft merger. Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang will oversee Yahoo's technology group until the company finds a replacement for Nazem, the company said Wednesday. Yahoo also is looking for someone to lead its products group. Nazem, 45, who joined Yahoo in early 1996, was made head of one of three groups as part of the company's restructuring in December. He was charged with developing the next advertising platform beyond Yahoo's Panama project, the company's upgraded Web advertising system targeting Google. Yahoo names new CFO Yahoo spokeswoman Helena Maus said Nazem's decision had nothing to do with Panama's performance - which analysts say has not had as significant an impact as hoped - and that he had been considering leaving for months. Nazem said in a blog post he decided to retire after 26 years in the technology industry, but did not want to do so until the introduction of Panama, which the company launched in February. Nazem will also receive his salary through the end of June and stock options granted in 2003, 2005 and 2006 will fully vest when he steps down. His right to exercise those options along with some granted in 1999 will extend for three years, Yahoo said in a regulatory filing. His annual salary for 2007 was about $500,000, according to a past Yahoo filing. "It was very important to me to drive all the way to my last day here at Yahoo without distractions of an announcement like this," he said. "So we chose to make the announcement and my end date as close as possible." Yahoo shares fell to $28.10 in extended trading from a close of $28.38 on Nasdaq.

The latest cuts -- combined with 3,500 announced in January -- will eliminate nearly 11 percent of the company's global workforce of 71,000. It is the biggest reduction since the dark period following the technology stock market's collapse in 2000, when Motorola shed about 40 percent of its workers. The latest round of cost cutting is expected to save $600 million annually, in addition to the $400 million in savings targeted in January, Chief Financial Officer Tom Meredith said Wednesday. "Long-term, sustainable profitability is -- and always has been -- Motorola's top priority," he said. Motorola's stock headed up on the news in after-hours trading after closing Wednesday at $18.28, down 2 cents per share from the previous day's close. President and Chief Operating Officer Gregory Brown said the company is taking steps to ensure that customer service, product quality and research and development programs won't suffer. But analysts said eliminating more jobs is not likely to help and may even hurt the company's fight to regain momentum in its key cell phone business. "It looks good on the surface but to get back in the game they need to come up with a very compelling phone platform very quick," said Charter Equity Research analyst Edward Snyder. "If you're not careful and judicious about where those cuts come from it could end up hurting more than helping." A Motorola spokeswoman said the cuts will be spread out among "all businesses, functions and regions." "We have made the very difficult decision to reduce our workforce by approximately 4,000 through normal attrition and some involuntary separations," she said. "At the same time it's important to note that we are continuing to hire top talent in critical areas." Motorola employed 66,000 at the end of last year but gained 5,000 with its acquisition this year of Symbol Technologies Inc., a maker of hand-held mobile computers. It employs about 15,000 in Ilinois Illinois, primarily in the Chicago area. The company has struggled since it slashed prices last year on its top-selling Razr to gain market share, turning the premium product into a commodity. Meanwhile, Motorola lagged in developing new high-end phones. "Essentially their employees are paying for the pricing misjudgments," said analyst Casey Ryan of Nollenberger Capital Partners. "Getting rid of employees doesn't really solve the problem. The company is going to need better products, not fewer people. "This seems like a good near-term fix to help &#091;profit&#093; margins, but it looks like it's probably going to hurt morale and be somewhat of a negative overall," Ryan said. Lawrence Harris of Oppenheimer & Co. said "you start to get diminishing returns" from job cuts. "Certainly cost controls are important but it's really the product portfolio -- having the right features at the right price" that matters, he said. "If you have a hot phone consumers will pay premium prices." A lot is riding on the phones Motorola is expected to announce in July for the holiday selling season, he said. ---------- berose@tribune.com mhughlett@tribune.com Chicago Bears Super Bowl coverage Wonders of the world 10 for the road Send a news tip What's in it for you?

Imperial Oil Ltd., about 70 percent owned by Exxon Mobil, in March raised its cost estimate for the Mackenzie Valley gas project to C$16.2 billion ($15.1 billion) from an October 2004 target of C$7.5 billion. ``At those costs, it&#39;s not viable to build that pipeline,&#39;&#39; Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson told reporters today after the Irving, Texas-based company held its annual shareholders meeting in Dallas. ``It may just be that this project will have to wait for a different cost environment.&#39;&#39; Calgary-based Imperial blamed more than half of the cost increase on surging steel prices and regulatory delays. ``The basic costs of commodities just shot past them,&#39;&#39; Tillerson said. ``It&#39;s not economical at this point.&#39;&#39; Soaring costs also may make the tapping of Alaskan gas fields too expensive to pursue, Tillerson said. Exxon Mobil and its partners in an Alaskan gas project estimated three years ago that building a pipeline to the North Slope would cost $22 billion to $25 billion. ``My expectation is if we went back and looked at the costs again, they would have gone up dramatically,&#39;&#39; Tillerson said. ``It involves lots of steel, lots of compressors, lots of valves, all the same things you need for the Canadian project.&#39;&#39; Imperial, Exxon Mobil and their partners in the Mackenzie project would need as much as C$2 billion in government aid or incentives such as accelerated depreciation to proceed, Chris Theal, an analyst at Tristone Capital Inc. in Calgary, said in a report last month. Plans in the 1970s to build a pipeline to tap Canada&#39;s northern gas reserves were halted by falling prices and concerns the development would disrupt the lives of aboriginals. A doubling in gas prices and an agreement for Indian groups to own a stake in the line helped revive the proposal this decade. In March, Imperial pushed back its target completion date for the pipeline to at least 2014, six years later than planned when the company applied for regulatory approval in 2004. The Mackenzie pipeline would carry about 1 billion cubic feet of gas a day from Canada&#39;s Northwest Territories and would span 1,220 kilometers (758 miles). It would connect to the North American pipeline grid in northern Alberta and supply enough gas for almost 10 percent of U.S. households. The pipeline also would open up the Northwest Territories and the Yukon to more petroleum exploration, said Robert Hunt, president of Calgary-based Horizon North Logistics Inc. The gas line would create a right-of-way through the Mackenzie River Valley that could be used to build a line that would haul crude from fields beneath the Arctic Ocean, Hunt said. Exxon Mobil and other energy producers have discovered more than 10 billion barrels of oil in North American arctic seas that remain stranded by a lack of pipelines, Hunt said. Besides Imperial and Exxon Mobil, partners in the Mackenzie project included Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, ConocoPhillips and the Aboriginal Pipeline Group, a company formed by Canadian Indian groups. In Alaska, state lawmakers on May 11 approved a plan by Governor Sarah Palin that gives companies incentives to build a pipeline to transport gas from the North Slope fields to the contiguous 48 states. The bill grants as much as $500 million in state funds for permitting costs and exempts gas shipped through the pipeline from production tax increases for 10 years. Exxon Mobil has said the bill&#39;s provisions are flawed. Shares of Exxon Mobil rose $1.38, or 1.7 percent, to $84 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has climbed 9.6 percent this year.

CTO is parting ways with the company effective immediately, according to an SEC filing this afternoon. The filing includes a copy of Nazem&#146;s separation agreement, which spells out that his involvement in the company actually ends today even though his termination date is June 8. Nazem joined the company in 1996 and became CTO in 1998. As part of the Yahoo! reorganization that led to the departure of COO Dan Rosensweig, Nazem was appointed to head technology, one of the three core units. , then CFO, was put in charge of the advertiser & publisher group while the job at the top of the third group, audience, has yet to be filled. Nazem recently reorganized the technology group; we posted his memo explaining the moves. Just last week, Nazem exercised options for 84,500 shares of stock at $24.75 and then sold them for $29.75 to $29.79 that day. Some of his remaining options will vest fully June 8 but the right to exercise his options following departure relies on his compliance, including an agreement not to engage in "certain competitive activities" for three years--i.e., no work in any way with )--and his agreement not to solicit any Yahoo! employees or contractors. (If he's with a company acquired by Google or Microsoft or is consulting in an area that didn't exist at Yahoo! as of June, 8, different story.) He'll get the remainder of his 2007 base pay in lieu of other severance. --He also agrees not to disparage Yahoo! for five years, and Yahoo! agrees that top execs, including his successor and the directors, will not disparage him. Nazem says he&#146;s retiring. From his post on Yahoo!'s blog, Yodel Anecdotal: "After spending the last 26 years in this fast-paced technology industry, I've finally decided it's time to slow down. I'll be retiring in early June. ... As I began contemplating retirement, there were a few milestones that I (along with the executive leadership team) wanted to accomplish prior to my departure. We wanted to realign the company and, subsequently, the Technology Group, successfully launch our new search monetization system (a.k.a. Panama) and build a solid technology leadership team to help take this company to the next level. It was very important to me to drive all the way to my last day here at Yahoo! without distractions of an announcement like this. So we chose to make the announcement and my end date as close as possible." --Jerry Yang will be the "interim executive sponsor of the Technology Group" until a permanent replacement is identified.

Nazem has definitely contributed to the online landscape as we know it, but honestly, I'm not too thrilled with what I've seen of Panama. I wouldn't go as far to say that he's the sole person to blame for Yahoo's perpetual need to play catchup, but perhaps some new blood and some relaxation should be in store for both Yahoo and Nazem respectively.

By midmorning, they were down $1.71, or 2 percent, to $82.69 on the New York Stock Exchange. Management during a conference call with analysts declined to take questions regarding the specific circumstances that led to Colby's ouster, but said no other employee resigned in connection with his departure.

Larry Glasscock, the company's current CEO and president, added that the action "in no way related to the CEO transition." Braly was named in late February to replace Glasscock, who is retiring.

"We don't have double standards at the company," Glasscock said, noting that Wellpoint's code of conduct applies to every employee. Another analyst asked if management expects to be sued as a result. Glasscock declined to answer the question, and simply said that Colby will do what he thinks is right "I believe we absolutely did the right thing based on where the facts led us," Glasscock added. Management said it has yet to name a new chief accounting officer to succeed DeVeydt in that position. analyst Matthew Borsch in a research note said, "While the CEO and CFO departures appear to be entirely unrelated, some uncertainty is likely to linger until investors are completely reassured that the departures have no bearing on the underlying fundamentals of the company as well as gain confidence in the new management team." "The stock is dead money between now and the third-quarter earnings report because you have this cloud of concern over it, with a new CEO and CFO who are untried and untested in these roles," said Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst who follows the industry for CRT Capital. Shares of Wellpoint, which reported that its membership rose about 2 percent to 34.9 million as of the end of March, have risen 7.25 percent year to date. They hit a record of $85.45 on May 17.

Colby, named the best health insurance CFO each of the past four years by Institutional Investor magazine, over unspecified violations of company rules. The conduct-code breaches were ``of a non-business nature&#39;&#39; and didn&#39;t involve illegality, WellPoint, the second-biggest U.S. health-insurance provider, said today in a statement. The company, based in Indianapolis, said its financial statements and forecasts are accurate. Colby, 53, left as Chief Executive Officer Larry C. Glasscock prepared to hand the top job at WellPoint to Angela F. Braly tomorrow. Colby was finance chief of WellPoint Health Networks Inc. in November 2004 when the company was bought by Anthem Inc. The acquirer took the name WellPoint and kept Colby as executive vice president and CFO. Wayne S. DeVeydt, 37, who was chief accounting officer, now succeeds Colby. ``We view Wayne as a solid choice to step into the CFO slot,&#39;&#39; said Justin Lake, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC in New York, in a note to investors today. ``That said, it will likely take the market some time to ingest the significant management turnover occurring at the company over the last several months.&#39;&#39; Colby didn&#39;t respond to an e-mail. A call placed to his office was forwarded to a spokeswoman. WellPoint shares fell $1.52, or 1.8 percent, to $82.88 at 10:23 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock had gained 18 percent in the 12 months through yesterday, underperforming a 27 percent increase in the six-member Standard & Poor&#39;s 500 Managed Care Index. UnitedHealth Group Inc., based in Minnetonka, Minnesota, is the largest U.S. medical insurance provider. An investigation of Colby&#39;s conduct by external legal counsel began in ``recent days,&#39;&#39; Glasscock said on a telephone call with investors and analysts. ``Certain concerns were raised, and we immediately began an investigation,&#39;&#39; Glasscock said. ``Based on this investigation, it was concluded that David Colby violated the company&#39;s code of conduct.&#39;&#39; WellPoint&#39;s code, available on the company&#39;s Web site, is a 25-page document that covers a variety of issues, including ethical decision-making, reporting of violations, protecting information, and maintaining the workplace environment. It sets limits on blogging and other Internet use; drugs and alcohol; possession of weapons; and political activity. Violating the code, or authorizing, failing to report, or failing to cooperate with an investigation of, a violation, can result in corrective action ``including termination of employment,&#39;&#39; the handbook says. Institutional Investor ranked Colby the top managed-care CFO in March, saying that investors ``credit Colby with helping to maintain stable financial results during the late 1990s, a tumultuous time for health insurers when public opinion of them plummeted. Many smaller companies went out of business or sought refuge in the arms of successful consolidators.&#39;&#39; The former finance chief was treated as any other employee would have been, Glasscock said. ``What&#39;s really important is that all of us read and agree to abide by the code of conduct,&#39;&#39; Glasscock said. ``We don&#39;t have double standards in the company. We have one set of standards that apply to everyone.&#39;&#39; Glasscock wouldn&#39;t say whether he thought Colby would sue the company for his dismissal. ``Obviously Dave Colby will make the decisions he thinks are appropriate for Dave Colby,&#39;&#39; Glasscock said. ``I believe we&#39;ve done absolutely the right thing based on where the facts led us.&#39;&#39; DeVeydt has been WellPoint&#39;s senior vice president and chief accounting officer since March 2005. He also assumed responsibility for investor relations and became chief of staff to Glasscock in 2006. Before joining WellPoint, DeVeydt served with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in many roles since 1996. ``While the circumstances we reported today are unfortunate, I&#39;m very pleased and honored to assume the role of chief financial officer,&#39;&#39; DeVeydt said on the telephone call. WellPoint announced Colby&#39;s latest recognition by Institutional Investor in a news release on Feb. 21. DeVeydt, in charge of investor relations, was listed as a contact person.

StumbleUpon Sold to Auction Giant eBay May 31, 2007 7:41AM The 12-year-old e-commerce powerhouse eBay had $3.5 billion in cash last month and has been aggressively acquiring smaller companies to compete against rivals ranging from Google to Amazon.com. EBay already owns Skype and portals such as Shopping.com and Rent.com, and completed the buyout of StubHub for $310 million earlier this year. StumbleUpon Sold to Auction Giant eBay Wall Street Shrugs Off Weak GDP Read Motorola To Cut 4,000 More Jobs Economy: Worst Growth Since 2002 CDW Accepts $7.3 Billion To Go Private EBay Inc. announced Wednesday that it acquired StumbleUpon Inc., a software startup that suggests Web sites based on reader reviews and personal preferences of its members. The $75 million cash acquisition gives eBay access to about 2.3 million people who have filled out profiles at StumbleUpon, founded in 2001 by three Canadian software engineers in Calgary. The venture capital-funded company, which recently relocated to San Francisco, is considered a pioneer of the so-called "Web 3.0" niche. The term refers to technology that pairs general Internet search capability with a user's personal data and aggregated community data, theoretically delivering more relevant results than a standard search engine such as Google Inc. For example, a StumbleUpon search for "cars" could generate a list of Web pages that factor in a user's income, age, gender, home address, current vehicles owned and other demographic data submitted. The search results would also include sites ranked favorably by other StumbleUpon members with similar interests and background. By contrast, a straight Google search delivers 357 million Web pages ranging from the popular Hollywood movie "Cars" to advertisements for used car dealers and newspaper classified sections. StumbleUpon is free for users and generates revenue through advertising, though the company doesn't disclose financial information. Members who pay an annual fee bypass advertisements completely. Michael Buhr, senior director at San Jose-based eBay, will serve as general manager of StumbleUpon. StumbleUpons founders and managers will become eBay employees. "StumbleUpon is a great fit within our goal of pioneering new communities based on commerce and sustained by trust," Buhr said. The acquisition is not expected to change eBay's latest financial guidance. The company expects to report second-quarter profit of 31 cents to 33 cents per share on sales in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. For the full year, eBay expects profit of $1.30 to $1.34 per share on sales of $7.2 billion to $7.45 billion. The 12-year-old e-commerce powerhouse had $3.5 billion in cash last month and has been aggressively acquiring smaller companies to compete against rivals ranging from Google to Amazon.com. EBay, which already owns Internet phone service Skype and portals such as Shopping.com and Rent.com, completed the buyout of online ticket reseller StubHub for $310 million earlier this year. &copy; 2007 Associated Press/AP Online.

Lee Partners and the specialty insurer for $5.3 billion in cash. The deal values Ceridian at $36 a share, a 5.3 percent premium to its closing price of $34.19 yesterday. In after-hours trading, Ceridian rose $1.41, or 4 percent, to $35.60. Ceridian and its buyers noted, however, that Ceridian was trading at around $31 before Feb. 17, when the company announced that it was putting itself up for sale. The deal represents a 16 percent premium over that price, and a 56 percent premium to Ceridian&#8217;s price on Oct. 6, the day before Ceridian announced Kathryn V. Marinello&#8217;s appointment as chief executive. Last year, Ceridian reported earnings of $174 million, or $1.20 a share, so the merger values the company at 30 times its trailing earnings, compared with about 18 times earnings for the average company in the Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s 500-stock index. Ceridian&#8217;s human resource division offers payroll, tax and benefits services to 110,000 companies, with a combined 25 million employees, in 38 countries. The company also processes payments and issues credit and stored-value cards for the trucking and retail industries. In a statement announcing the deal, Thomas H. Lee and Fidelity said they planned to bring other investors into the transaction. Fidelity will own less than 50 percent of Ceridian at closing and for accounting purposes will not consolidate Ceridian&#8217;s results into its income statement. The transaction will be presented to Ceridian shareholders for approval at the company&#8217;s annual meeting, after the filing of proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ceridian said it would hold its annual meeting no later than Sept. 21.

The Chicago purchasing-managers' index rose to 61.7% in May from 52.9% in April, the Chicago NAPM reported. The size of the gain surprised analysts. Economists were expecting the Chicago PMI index to inch higher to 54.0%. Readings over 50% indicate that more firms were expanding than contracting. The report seems to dovetail with recent data that point to a modest recovery in manufacturing after a slow patch in the first quarter. Just how slow things were in the first quarter was revealed earlier on Thursday when the government revised down its estimate of first quarter growth to a paltry 0.6%, the slowest pace in four years. The Chicago PMI has been of interest chiefly because it was seen to provide hints as to the movement in the national Institute of Supply Management index, which will be released on Friday. But economists say the Chicago report has provided little information about the national index in the last few years. Before the Chicago index was released, economists are looking for the ISM to slip to 53.5% in May, after surging to 54.7% in April. In the Chicago report, the new orders index rose to 71.1% from 56.5% in the previous month. Production jumped to 69.8% from 62.2% in April. This was the highest level of production since April 2005. The employment index rose to 57.3% from 50.5%. The prices paid index rose to 70.2 from 64.9% in April. The Chicago index covers all types of firms, not just manufacturers. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.1% in April. In another report, the Labor Department said jobless claims fell slightly in the latest week. Greg Robb is a senior reporter for MarketWatch in Washington.

Assistant U.S. attorney Eric Sussman offered no explanation why he asked Judge Amy St. Eve for approval to drop the money-laundering charge, which was added to the indictment in December, 2005. Black, who is also a member of the House of Lords, was the only one among four co-defendants who was facing the charge. Former media mogul Conrad black arrives at federal court in Chicago, Wednesday, May 30, 2007, for his continuing racketeering and fraud trial. Black, 62, is charged with swindling the big Hollinger International newspaper holding company he headed out of $84 million. Photograph by : Charles Rex Arbogast/AP Email to a friend Edward Genson, a defence attorney representing Black, quipped, â€œOK, I guess I can goâ€ as the charge was dropped. The 16-member jury was not present and attorneys in the case were discussing issues related to the trial, including upcoming evidence. The U.S. government alleges Black and three other senior Hollinger International executives misappropriated $60 million US in bonuses disguised as non-compete payments from Hollinger International during the sale of newspaper assets. All have pleaded not guilty. The decision provided a bright spot for the defence before the jury arrived and prosecutors introduced a stack of documents found inside the 13 boxes that Black was videotaped removing from Hollinger Inc.â€™s office in Toronto into evidence. The boxes included receipts for purchases Black had made at a number of luxury stores, among them more than $116,000 US at Yves St. Laurent; $101,550 US at Fendi and $2.62 million US at Graff Diamonds Limited. Prosecutor Jeffrey Cramer also flashed bank statements showing a deposit made to Black for $4.3 million US from American Publishing Company on April 9, 2001, and travel documents from Tekura Tahiti Travel related to Blackâ€™s trip to Bora Bora. An original copy of a contract signed by Black was also shown to the jury. The contents of the battered office boxes, which have been sitting in front of the jurors on a trolley in the courtroom for days, had largely remained a mystery to them until Wednesday. The jury also saw an e-mail that Black sent to co-defendant Peter Atkinson on Jan. 17, 2003, referring to a public company as a â€œvehicle for extracting money, as in the non-competes.â€ After presenting the jury with the flurry of documents, Sussman announced, â€œAt this time, the prosecution rests.â€ After jurors filed out of the courtroom, Black and his wife, Barbara Amiel, left the room holding hands. The press baron had a faint smile on his lips. Black is facing an additional charge of obstruction of justice, which is directly linked to the removal of the boxes. After the jurors had left for the day, Marc Martin, a defence lawyer for Black, applied to St. Eve to have all of the charges against the press baron dismissed. He took particular exception with the obstruction of justice charge, arguing that were it not for an Ontario court order that prevented the removal of documents from Hollinger Inc. in May 20005, the charge would have no basis. â€œWe donâ€™t know what Mr. Blackâ€™s intention was,â€ Martin argued, pointing out that the press baron had been ordered to vacate the office by the end of the month. Sussman argued the charge is also directly relevant to investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a grand jury, as well as the federal court proceedings in Chicago. Lawyers for Blackâ€™s co-defendants also applied to have various charges against their clients dismissed. The defence will begin presenting its case today. The first witness expected to be called is call Joan Maida, Blackâ€™s personal assistant in Toronto, as its first witness on Thursday. Ken Whyte, the editor of Macleanâ€™s magazine, who has selected by Black to launch the National Post, will also take the stand. Defence attorneys have indicated their case will not be lengthy and will likely wrap up in the second week of June. Edward Greenspan, a Canadian lawyer representing Black, told St. Eve that he had intended to call a parole lawyer from British Columbia to explain the sentence that David Radler, Blackâ€™s former lieutenant in Canada, could be expected to serve in Canada after signing his so-called â€œsweetheart dealâ€ with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony and a lenient 29-month sentence. But Greenspan said that when he called the provinceâ€™s leading lawyer, who he did not name, he was informed the lawyer was already working for Radler. That lawyer, however, could still end up testifying about his relationship with Radler at the criminal trial in Chicago. Radler previously testified that he was unaware of that he could spend as little as six months in prison under Canadian laws. He has indicated he would like to serve his sentence in British Columbia, near his home.

May 30 2007: 1:47 PM EDT NEW YORK (Reuters) -- The American Civil Liberties Union is suing a unit of Boeing Co., charging that it assisted the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency in abducting suspect foreigners to overseas prisons where it says they were held and tortured. The ACLU said it would file a lawsuit against (up $1.15 to $99.65, ) unit Jeppesen Dataplan Inc. later on Wednesday, accusing the company of providing flight and logistical support to at least 15 aircraft on 70 so-called "rendition" flights. Boeing CFO James Bell talks with Fortune's Geoffrey Colvin about what it takes to handle high risk projects that put the company in peril. The suit, to be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, is being made on behalf of three people the ACLU said had been abducted by the CIA. "American corporations should not be profiting from a CIA rendition program that is unlawful and contrary to core American values," Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, said in a statement. "Corporations that choose to participate in such activity can and should be held legally accountable." At least 1,245 CIA flights were made into or over Europe in the four years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, a European Parliament report said earlier this year. Washington acknowledges the secret transfer of suspects to third countries but denies torturing them or handing them over to countries that did. A Jeppesen representative declined to comment on the suit, and would not say whether the CIA was a customer of the company. According to the ACLU, Jeppesen played a key role in what it called the U.S. government's rendition program, providing aircraft crew with itineraries, preparing flight plans, procuring landing permits from foreign governments and helping with customs clearance and ground transportation. "Without the participation of companies like Jeppesen, the program could not have gotten off the ground," Steven Watt, a staff attorney for the ACLU's Human Rights Program, said in a statement. The suit is being brought on behalf of Binyam Mohamed, Abou Elkassim Britel and Ahmed Agiza, three foreign nationals whom the ACLU said were abducted and moved to secret overseas locations where they were tortured. The suit claims Jeppesen knew the purpose of the rendition flights. It is to be filed under the Alien Tort Statute, which permits foreigners to bring claims in the United States for violations of the law of nations or a United States treaty. The ACLU also said on Wednesday that it would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the dismissal of a lawsuit against former CIA Director George Tenet and 10 CIA employees by a German who says he was kidnapped and tortured by the spy agency about three years ago. In March, a U.S. appeals court upheld the dismissal of the suit, brought by Khaled el-Masri, a German of Lebanese origin, after agreeing with U.S. government arguments that moving forward with the case would pose a risk of exposing state secrets. El-Masri was arrested in Macedonia in late 2003 and says he was handed over to the CIA, who flew him to Afghanistan and wrongly held him until his release in May 2004.

US economy slows to crawl, but some see rebound Washington, May 31: The US economy slowed to a 0.6 percent growth pace in the first quarter of 2007, the weakest in over four years, the government said Thursday in a revision for the January-March period. But even though the world's largest economy appeared to sputter, many analysts said the report reflected the low point for the year and that there are already signs of a rebound. Gross domestic product ( GDP) was revised down from last month's estimate of 1.3 percent and was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 2002, the Commerce Department report showed. The figure was below the 0.8 percent growth pace forecast by most Wall Street analysts and came after a 2.5 percent expansion in the fourth quarter of 2006. Many economists said details of the report validate the view of the Federal Reserve that growth would pick up over the course of 2007. "The cloud on first-quarter growth is the silver lining for the second quarter," said Drew Matus, senior economist at Lehman Brothers. "I think we'll see second-quarter growth above three percent and 2.5 percent for all of 2007." Matus and others said consumer spending was better than expected and that inventories had been brought to a low point, requiring factories to ramp up production. "GDP was revised a little more than expected but a lot had to do with a huge downward adjustment in inventories which actually sets things up for a good gain in production in the second quarter and raises optimism for the economic outlook," noted Sal Guatieri at BMO Financial Group. The Commerce Department said the latest revision came as a result of a bigger-than-expected trade deficit, which meant more goods consumed in the United States were produced abroad. Real estate remained the main drag on economic growth, but the decline was a bit less than earlier estimated. Spending on residential investment fell 15.4 percent, instead of an earlier estimate of 17 percent. Consumer spending was the main driver of growth, increasing 4.4 percent, up from the earlier estimate of 3.8 percent. This is seen as a key because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of US economic activity. Business investment was better than earlier estimates, growing 2.9 percent, revised up from 2.0 percent. An inflation indicator linked to GDP showed a 3.3 percent gain in prices, down from an earlier estimate of 3.4 percent. Core prices, excluding food and energy, were up an unrevised 2.2 percent. The Commerce Department will make its second and final revision to GDP next month. Scott Anderson, economist at Wells Fargo, said he expected a shift in the growth picture after a first quarter that was "almost all driven by consumer spending." "We think consumers will take a bit of a breather, with growth at about two percent, but that will be made up by other factors," including increased exports and factory activity, he noted. Even though some analysts have predicted the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates to stimulate flagging growth, the central bank has stated that inflation is its primary concern and has not ruled out future rate hikes. In minutes released Wednesday, Fed members said they expected a pickup in activity. If this acceleration occurs, this will put the economy closer to a sustainable rate of around three percent and "it will complicate the Fed's job, with inflation being sticky," said Matus. *Your friend's e-mail address: Libya announces USD 900 mn gas deal with BP Bush picks Zoellick as new World Bank chief US risks budget crisis over health-care costs: OECD French President threatens to veto WTO farm talks Yahoo!

The feed ingredients were made by Tembec BTLSR Inc. of Toledo, Ohio and Uniscope, Inc. of Johnstown, Colo. Tembec, a contract manufacturer for Uniscope, makes AquaBond and Aqua-Tec II, which it distributes for Uniscope. Uniscope makes Xtra-Bond using ingredients supplied by Tembec. All of the products are binding agents that are used to make pelleted feed for cattle, sheep, and goats, or fish and shrimp. The companies have confirmed that Tembec added melamine as part of the formulation of the products to improve the binding properties of pelleted feed. Melamine is not approved as an additive for animal or fish/shrimp feed. The companies have stopped adding melamine to the feed products. Based on the levels of melamine and related compounds in the initial ingredients, FDA estimated the probable level of melamine and related compounds in livestock feed as less than 50 parts per million (ppm) based on the recommended mix rate of two to four pounds of binding agent per ton of livestock feed. The estimated levels in fish and shrimp feed are less than 233 ppm and 465 ppm, respectively, of melamine and related compounds. The estimated levels of melamine and related compounds vary in the livestock feed and the fish and shrimp feed because of differing levels of melamine in the binding agents used for each type of feed. FDA advises feed manufacturers and others who mix their own feed not to use these products, and to contact the manufacturers. FDA advises feed manufacturers to recall finished feed that is made from AquaBond or Aqua-Tec II due to the estimated levels of melamine and related compounds in the finished products. FDA believes that no recall is warranted of the finished feed made from Xtra-Bond based on the estimated levels of melamine and related compounds in the finished product and based on currently available data and information. The estimated melamine levels in feed made with these binding agents are similar to the levels discussed in the interim safety/risk assessment of melamine and related compounds made available by FDA earlier this month. In that assessment, federal scientists determined that, based on currently available data and information, the consumption of pork, chicken, domestic fish, and eggs from animals inadvertently fed animal feed contaminated with melamine and its analogues is very unlikely to pose a human health risk. The interim safety/risk assessment concludes that in the most extreme risk assessment scenario, when scientists assumed that all the solid food a person consumes in an entire day contained melamine and the melamine compound cyanuric acid in equal amounts, the potential exposure is about 250 times lower than the dose considered safe. This is a large safety margin. Translated to consumption levels, this means that a person weighing 132 pounds would have to eat more than 800 pounds per day of food containing melamine and its compounds to approach a level of consumption that would cause a health concern. FDA is encouraging domestic feed suppliers to be vigilant in quality control in their supply chain and to monitor for any improper additives, including melamine and its analogs. The Tembec and Uniscope products also reportedly contain a urea formaldehyde resin-type ingredient, a raw ingredient used to make the binding agent in these products. FDA is investigating this use of the urea formaldehyde resin-type ingredient in the Tembec and Uniscope products, and will take appropriate regulatory action if warranted.

If the vessel was Spanish or was removed from that country's waters, any treasure would belong to Spain, said James Goold, an attorney representing the government. "It's a very well established principle under Spanish, U.S. and international law that a government such as the kingdom of Spain has not abandoned its sunken ships or sunken property, and that a company like Odyssey Marine Exploration may not conduct recovery operations without authorization by the government," he said. "The kingdom of Spain has not authorized any such operations by Odyssey, and by these legal actions it will see the return of any Spanish property Odyssey has recovered," Goold said of the claims filed Wednesday. Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. co-founder Greg Stemm said Thursday the company was working on a statement in response to Spain's claims. He has previously called Spain's legal threats "absurd" and said that Odyssey would notify all claimants once it conclusively determined the ship's identity. The company announced two weeks ago that it had discovered a shipwreck containing 500,000 gold and silver coins somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. The Tampa-based company said the site was outside any country's territorial waters but would not give the exact location or name of the ship. Odyssey has said that the ship was not in Spanish territorial waters and was not the HMS Sussex, a shipwreck that Odyssey recently got permission from the Spanish government to search for in the Strait of Gibraltar. But Spain has called the new discovery suspicious and said the booty may have come from a wrecked Spanish galleon. In Britain, the find generated press reports that Odyssey had salvaged the wreck of the long-sought British vessel Merchant Royal, which sank in bad weather off England in 1641. Odyssey has not confirmed or denied these reports. Spain is using the U.S. law firm Covington & Burling, which has represented Spain over shipwreck cases before, including the recovery of material from two ships, Juno and La Galga, in a 2000 court case. The Spanish government won the case at that time. Associated Press writers Jennifer Kay in Miami and Mar Roman in Madrid, Spain, contributed to this report.

AUGSTUMS 05.31.07, 8:27 AM ET said Thursday it would acquire A.G. Edwards Inc. for $6.8 billion in cash and stock in a deal to form one of the largest retail stock brokerages in the United States. The combined entity will operate as Wachovia ) Securities, headquartered in St. Louis, and will have more than 3,300 brokerage locations nationwide, more than $1.1 trillion in client assets, and nearly 15,000 financial advisers. Other A.G. Edwards businesses, including research, underwriting, investment banking, mutual funds and trust, will be consolidated into Wachovia's existing operating lines. Wachovia said A.G. Edwards shareholders would get 0.9844 Wachovia shares and $35.80 in cash for each A.G. Edwards share held. That offer values A.G. Edwards at $89.50 per share based on Wednesday's closing prices, a 16 percent premium. "The long-term growth opportunities of the brokerage industry are extremely compelling to Wachovia, and we have long expressed our interest in growing this business both organically and through acquisition," Ken Thompson, Wachovia's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. The deal continues a string of high-profile acquisitions engineered by Charlotte, N.C.-based Wachovia, including First Union, Prudential Securities and, most recently, Golden West Financial Corp. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2007, with full integration by early 2009. Wachovia said Daniel J. Ludeman, currently president and chief executive of its Wachovia Securities unit, will keep those roles at the combined brokerage unit. A.G. Edwards Chairman and CEO Robert Bagby will be chairman of the brokerage. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The suit does not refer specifically to Odyssey's claim on May 18 that it had legally recovered gold and silver coins worth an estimated $500 million from a colonial-era wreck code-named "Black Swan" at an undisclosed location in the Atlantic Ocean. But Spain's Culture Ministry has called that discovery -- one of the world's biggest finds of sunken treasure -- suspicious and said the booty may have come from a wrecked Spanish galleon. "The Kingdom of Spain has not abandoned its ownership and other rights in sunken vessels of the Kingdom of Spain, in vessels sunk while in the service of the Kingdom of Spain, and in cargo or other property of the Kingdom of Spain on or in sunken vessels," said the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. "All sovereign and other rights in such vessels, cargo, artifacts or other contents have been reserved," it said. "The Kingdom of Spain further affirms and restates that arrest, recovery, or other unauthorized disturbance or recovery by Odyssey Marine Exploration of property of the Kingdom of Spain is not authorized, and the Kingdom of Spain reserves all rights and remedies arising from such activities." A spokesman for Tampa-based Odyssey could not be reached for immediate comment on the suit, which was filed on Spain's behalf by Washington-based attorney James Goold. But the company has said that the "Black Swan" recovery mission did not fall under Spanish jurisdiction. Goold said Wednesday's suit was one of three the Spanish government was filing against Odyssey aimed at blocking its claims to various shipwrecks, including the "Black Swan." &copy; Reuters 2007.

March 13, 2007 in Owasso, Oklahoma. Kornegay is in the midst of the spring calving season when he normally doubles the feed for his cattle. But rising corn prices have forced him to cut feed by half. &#40;Brandi Simons/ Getty Images&#41; By Lisa Richwine and Christopher Doering WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two companies are recalling livestock and fish feed ingredients because they contain the same chemical linked to the deaths of cats and dogs from tainted pet food, U.S. health officials said on Wednesday. The presence of melamine and related compounds in feed ingredients sold by Uniscope Inc. and a unit of Tembec Inc. was unrelated to the pet food contamination by ingredients from China, the Food and Drug Administration said. Officials said Tembec confirmed it intentionally added melamine to improve the binding properties of ingredients used to make feed pellets. Melamine is not an approved feed additive. Investigators are unsure how many animals may have consumed tainted feed. Officials said melamine levels were low and it was unlikely humans would be harmed. "The companies have stopped adding melamine to the feed product," Dr. David Acheson, FDA assistant commissioner for food protection, told reporters. "FDA is advising feed manufacturers and others who mix their own feed not to use these products, and to contact the manufacturers." Acheson said Ohio-based Tembec BTLSR, a unit of the Canadian wood products company Tembec, recalled AquaBond and Aqua-Tec II feed ingredients, which it distributes for Uniscope. Colorado-based Uniscope also recalled its Xtra-Bond product that was made with ingredients supplied by Tembec. The products are binding agents used to make feed pellets for cattle, sheep, goats, fish and shrimp. Tembec said it was cooperating with the FDA. "We discontinued the use of melamine in our formulation earlier this spring," Tembec executive vice president John Valley said, adding "we're talking about a low concentration of an element that is in turn a low component of any feed product." Uniscope originally notified the FDA about the contamination on May 18, agency officials said. "We don't think the concentration is very high," said Charlie Russell, a spokesman for Uniscope. "But if FDA thinks it's a big deal I'm not sure we're going to disagree with it."

In an indictment filed in U.S. district court in Manhattan, prosecutors allege the defendants at the "Big Four" accounting firm created and marketed tax shelters from 1998 through 2004 based on false and fraudulent scenarios to allow wealthy individuals to reduce the federal taxes they would have to pay. The Ernst & Young current or former partners named in the case are Robert Coplan, Martin Nissenbaum, Richard Shapiro and Brian Vaughn. A lawyer for Shapiro, John Tigue, said he has cooperated with the government for the last five years. "He intends to vigorously defend himself," Tigue said in a statement. Brian Linder, a lawyer for Nissenbaum, said in a statement that his client has entered a plea of "not guilty." "We have provided them (The U.S. attorney's office) over the past year with evidence that Mr. Nissenbaum did not engage in any unlawful activity," Linder said. Lawyers for Coplan and Vaughn could not be immediately reached for comment. Prosecutors allege that the four defendants schemed to defraud the IRS by deceiving the IRS about tax shelters that were marketed and sold to clients with taxable income, generally higher than $10 or $20 million. The indictment also charges that Coplan, Nissenbaum and Shapiro implemented tax shelters in 2000 to evade their own taxes, and arranged for eight other Ernst & Young partners to participate in that transaction, evading $3.7 million in taxes. Ernst & Young has made changes to its tax practice since the transactions in question, the accounting firm said. "The individuals who were indicted are two former partners and two partners who have been on administrative leave," Ernst & Young spokesman Charles Perkins said in a statement. "They were part of a small group within the firm, disbanded years ago,.... Ernst & Young has cooperated with the government from the beginning of its investigation, and we will continue to do so." Rival "Big Four" accounting firm KPMG has also been under scrutiny for tax shelters. In 2005, KPMG agreed to pay $456 million, accept an outside monitor and admit to wrongdoing to resolve a federal investigation into questionable tax shelters it sold to wealthy individuals. Sixteen of the KPMG's former employees are due to face trial over the shelters in September. (Additional reporting by Martha Graybow) (c) Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

The test of 626 volunteers with the kidney cancer compared the drug, also known as Torisel, with standard treatment using interferon alfa, along with a combination of both medicines. The combination turned out to be no better than interferon alfa alone. Average survival times were 7.3 months with interferon alfa and 8.4 months with the combination, which is not a significant difference. But with temsirolimus alone, the median survival time was 10.9 months. The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Food and Drug Administration made it the third such therapy approved since late 2005 for renal-cell carcinoma, the most common form of kidney cancer. In December 2005, the FDA cleared Bayer's Nexavar, or sorafenib. In January 2006, Pfizer Inc.'s Sutent, or sunitinib, also won approval. Nearly 39,000 people are diagnosed in the United States with renal-cell carcinoma each year. Once the tumor has spread -- as it does in about one third of the patients -- there is usually no cure. &copy; Reuters 2007.

The latest job cuts, due to be implemented by the end of the year, come on top of an earlier 3,500 job reduction designed to generate annual savings of $400m. Taken together, the move will reduce Motorola's global workforce, which stood at 66,000 at the end of 2006, by more than 11 per cent and underscores the determination of Ed Zander, Motorola's chief executive, and his senior management team to cut costs and get Motorola back on track. Motorola, which reported a first-quarter loss after its strategy to lift market share fell apart and margins collapsed, said it expected restructuring charges of about $300m, or about 8 cents per share, over the rest of 2007 as a result of the additional job cuts. The company, which said it was on track to complete the previously announced job cuts by June 30, forecast an additional $600m in annual cost savings next year as a result of the extra job cuts and other moves including spending controls and site rationalisation. "Long-term, sustainable profitability is â€“ and always has been â€“ Motorola's top priority," said Tom Meredith, chief financial officer. "We are confident the steps we are announcing today, together with the actions we have outlined previously, will further improve the company's financial and operational performance." The news came as Motorola revealed that Carl Icahn, the billionaire Wall Street investor who launched a proxy battle this year for a board seat after building up a 2.9 per cent stake in the company, won 717.7m votes compared with 931.7m cast in favour of the board's preferred candidate.

The National Association of Purchasing Management in Chicago is considered an early read on business conditions nationally. The monthly index, which covers services as well as manufacturing, is expected to rise to 54 from April's 52.9 reading, according to a median forecast of economists surveyed by Thomson Financial. The index will be released at 9:45 a.m. Thursday. Last month's reading of 52.9 was down from a two-year high of 61.7 in March. The drop was due to a dramatic slowdown in new orders and a decline in employment for the fourth month out of the previous five, among other factors, the April survey said. The index is seen as a precursor of the results from a nationwide survey of manufacturing activity conducted by the Institute for Supply Management, formerly the National Association of Purchasing Managers. The Chicago group is an affiliate of the ISM, which represents purchasing executives nationwide. Some analysts, however, argue that the Chicago survey has become less predictive of the ISM manufacturing report. According to analysts at Thomson Financial's IFR Markets, while there was a 92.5 percent correlation between the two indices from January 2000 to August 2004, that has weakened to 55.1 percent since the start of 2006.

Colby, this morning. â€œI fully expect the rest of our executive leadership team to remain together,â€ WellPoint General Counsel Angela F. Braly told stock analysts today. Braly is set to become CEO of the Indianapolis health insurer tomorrow, replacing long-time chief Larry C. Glasscock. WellPoint announced this morning that Colby was fired for violating the companyâ€™s code of conduct, but did not reveal the violation. Asked by analysts if WellPoint expected to be sued by Colby, Glasscock said, â€œObviously, Dave Colby will make the decisions that he thinks are appropriate for Dave Colby. But I believe weâ€™ve done absolutely the right things based on where the facts led us.â€ WellPoint shares were down $1.62, or 1.9 percent, in morning trading. Analysts said the recent turnover of the health insurerâ€™s CEO and CFO positions are unnerving investors. â€œComing on the heels of the unexpected CEO resignation earlier this year and the very-high profile role that the CFO has played with Wall Street over the years, we believe [Colbyâ€™s resignation is] likely to create considerable uncertainty in the stock over the coming months,â€ Bear Stearns analyst John Rex wrote in a note to investors this morning.

Our quarterly results included the net favorable impact of certain significant items as described in the "Significant Items" section below. Excluding these items, earnings per diluted share were $1.10 for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as compared to $1.11 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. For the quarter, improved operating results at Sears Canada and lower expenses at Sears Domestic were offset by reduced operating results at Kmart, where a decline in sales resulted in reduced gross margin dollars. "In part, our domestic operating results reflect the impact of some of the same challenges being faced by our customers, such as rising energy costs and a slower housing market," said Aylwin Lewis, Sears Holdings' chief executive officer and president. "However, as an organization, we need to overcome these factors by better controlling costs and developing innovative solutions that better meet our customers' needs and allow us to generate a more reasonable level of profitability even in the face of such challenges." A reconciliation of earnings per share excluding the above-noted significant items (a non-GAAP measure) to GAAP diluted earnings per share is set forth below. In addition, earnings per diluted share for the quarter benefited from lower average diluted shares outstanding during the current year quarter as compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2006. First Quarter Revenues and Comparable Store Sales Domestic comparable store sales declined 3.9% during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Sears Domestic comparable store sales declined 3.4% for the quarter, while Kmart comparable store sales declined 4.4%. We believe these declines reflect both increased competition and the impact of external factors such as rising energy costs, a slower housing market and poor weather conditions during the latter part of the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Kmart experienced lower transaction volumes across most merchandise categories, most notably within home goods, health and beauty products, and food and consumables. Similarly, Sears Domestic recorded comparable store sales declines across most merchandise categories and formats, with a notable decline in home appliance sales, which we believe reflects both a slower U.S. housing market and the impact of increased competition. Our fiscal 2007 first quarter was comprised of the 13-week period ended May 5, 2007, while our fiscal 2006 first quarter was comprised of the 13-week period ended April 29, 2006. This week shift in sales, while having a somewhat favorable impact on total revenues recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2006, had no impact on the comparable store sales results reported herein. This is due to the fact that, for purposes of reporting comparable sales for the first quarter, weeks 1 through 13 of fiscal 2007 have been compared to weeks 2 through 14 of fiscal 2006, thereby eliminating the impact of the week shift. For the quarter, total revenues declined $0.3 billion, or 2.5%, to $11.7 billion in fiscal 2007, as compared to $12.0 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. This decline reflects the above-noted impact of lower comparable store sales partially offset by sales increases within both our Lands' End and home services businesses. In addition, the week shift in reporting as detailed above had a favorable impact on total revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, by approximately 0.5%. The largest sales decline for the quarter was recorded at Kmart, where revenues declined $239 million, or 5.6%, primarily as a result of the above-noted comparable store sales declines, as well as a decrease in the total number of Kmart stores in operation. For the quarter, our operating income increased $62 million to $393 million in fiscal 2007, as compared to $331 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. This increase primarily reflects: 1) a gain of $30 million for a legal settlement reached in connection with a contractual dispute, 2) a $27 million curtailment gain recorded for amendments made by Sears Canada to its post-retirement benefit plans, and 3) a $15 million gain for insurance recoveries received on claims filed for certain of our property damaged by hurricanes during fiscal 2005. The favorable impact of these items, as well as improved operating results at Sears Canada and lower expenses at Sears Domestic, were partly offset by lower operating income at Kmart. As noted above, a number of items significantly impacted our fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 first quarter diluted earnings per share. While these types of items periodically affect our results, they vary significantly in amount from period to period, and had a disproportionate effect on our results for the periods presented. Management considers the total impact of these items, along with reported results, when it reviews and evaluates our financial performance. The impact of these items on diluted earnings per share is shown in the following table: 13 Weeks Ended May 5, April 29, 2007 2006 Earnings per diluted share $1.40 $1.14 Legal settlement gain 0.12 -- Sears Canada post-retirement benefit plans curtailment gain 0.11 -- Hurricane related recoveries 0.06 -- Dividend -- investment in Sears Mexico 0.08 -- Total return swap losses (0.08) -- Gain on sales of assets 0.01 0.06 Restructuring charges -- (0.03) Earnings per diluted share excluding above items $1.10 $1.11 During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recognized: 1) a $30 million gain ($18 million after tax or $0.12 per diluted share) related to the legal settlement of a contractual dispute, 2) a curtailment gain of $27 million ($16 million after tax or $0.11 per diluted share) related to certain amendments made to Sears Canada's post-retirement benefit plans, 3) a gain of $15 million ($9 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share) for insurance recoveries received on claims filed for certain of our property damaged by hurricanes during fiscal 2005, and 4) a $20 million ($12 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) dividend we received on our investment in Sears Mexico. These gains were partially offset by investment losses of $21 million ($13 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) incurred during the quarter on our total return swap investments. In addition, the first quarter of fiscal 2007 included $5 million ($2 million after tax or $0.01 per diluted share) of gains on sales of assets, as compared to $17 million ($10 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share) of such gains in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The first quarter of fiscal 2006 also included restructuring charges of $9 million ($5 million after tax or $0.03 per diluted share). There were no restructuring charges in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We had cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion at May 5, 2007 (of which $3.1 billion is domestic and $0.3 billion is at Sears Canada) as compared to $3.2 billion at April 29, 2006 and $4.0 billion at February 3, 2007. The decline from February 3, 2007 primarily reflects increased merchandise inventories given seasonal shifts in our inventory levels in support of the spring/summer-selling season. Additionally, we spent $113 million on capital expenditures and made debt repayments of $47 million, net of new borrowings, during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Merchandise inventories at May 5, 2007 were approximately $10.3 billion, as compared to $9.6 billion at April 29, 2006. The increase primarily reflects planned increases resulting from efforts aimed at improving in-stock levels and expanding product assortments this year as well as, acquisition of previously consigned pharmacy inventory at Kmart, earlier receipt of products and lower than forecast sales levels. Merchandise payables were $3.5 billion at May 5, 2007, as compared to $3.6 billion as of April 29, 2006. During the first quarter of 2007, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock through our share repurchase program, although we received approximately 114,000 shares of our common stock during the quarter in connection with bankruptcy-related settlements. As of May 5, 2007, we had remaining authorization to repurchase $604 million of common shares under our existing share repurchase program. The remaining shares may be purchased in the open market, through self-tender offers or through privately negotiated transactions. Timing will depend on prevailing market conditions, alternative uses of capital and other factors. For purposes of evaluating operating performance, our management uses an Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") measurement computed as operating income appearing on the statement of income less depreciation and amortization and gains/(losses) on sales of assets. In addition, it is adjusted to exclude certain nonrecurring gains and restructuring charges. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses for comparable periods. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used by investors or other third parties as the sole basis for formulating investment decisions as it excludes a number of important cash and non-cash recurring items. Management compensates for this limitation by using GAAP financial measures as well in managing our businesses. While Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement, management believes that it is an important indicator of operating performance because: -- EBITDA excludes the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest and depreciation costs; -- Management considers gains/(losses) on the sale of assets to result from investing decisions rather than ongoing operations; and -- Restructuring activities and other significant items as described above, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and have a disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects the comparability of results; Adjusted EBITDA was determined as follows: 13 Weeks Ended millions May 5, April 29, 2007 2006 Operating income per statement of income $393 $331 Plus depreciation and amortization 263 289 Less gain on sale of assets (5) (17) Before excluded items 651 603 Legal settlement gain (30) -- Sears Canada post-retirement benefit plans curtailment gain (27) -- Hurricane related recoveries (15) -- Restructuring charges -- 9 Adjusted EBITDA as defined $579 $612 % to revenues 4.9% 5.1% Adjusted EBITDA for our domestic (United States operations) and Sears Canada operations are as follows: millions 13 Weeks Ended Adjusted EBITDA % To Revenues May 5, April 29, May 5, April 29, 2007 2006 2007 2006 Domestic operations $528 $574 4.9% 5.2% Sears Canada 51 38 5.0% 3.6% Total Adjusted EBITDA $579 $612 4.9% 5.1% Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q We plan to file with the SEC our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter 2007 on or about June 1, 2007.

Consensus: ! 1Q 1Q 4Q ! +0.8% ! Overall GDP Growth +0.6% +1.3% +2.5% ! Actual: ! PCE Price Index +3.3% +3.4% -1.0% ! +0.6% ! =============================================================== Gross domestic product rose at a seasonally adjusted 0.6% annual rate January through March, the Commerce Department said in a new, revised estimate of first-quarter GDP. It was the weakest performance since a 0.2% increase in fourth-quarter 2002 GDP. Originally, the government had estimated first-quarter 2007 GDP rose 1.3%. Fourth-quarter 2006 GDP climbed 2.5%. Corporate profits got a bit stronger in the first three months of 2007. Profits after taxes grew by 1.0% to $1.184 trillion in the first quarter, after rising by 0.8% in the fourth quarter. Year over year, profits increased 6.4%. Price inflation gauges were barely touched in the government's revisions to the economic data. The economy's engine, consumer spending, was revised higher, but bigger imports and a drawdown by businesses in inventories led to a sharp downward revision to GDP, a measure of all goods and services produced in the economy. Wall Street was a little surprised by the size of the adjustment; the median estimate of 24 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires was a 0.8% increase. The report showed businesses decreased inventories in the first quarter, a decline of $4.5 billion. Originally, Commerce estimated a $14.8 billion increase. Companies had elevated stocks $22.4 billion in the fourth quarter. The drawdown of goods in the first quarter reduced GDP during that period by 0.98 percentage point. In its original report on first-quarter GDP, Commerce said inventories subtracted 0.30 percentage point from growth. Trade took a bigger bite out of the economy than first estimated - because U.S. imports were stronger, rising 5.7% instead of the originally reported 2.3%. Exports were revised higher, falling 0.6% instead of 1.2%. Trade cut GDP by 1.00 percentage points in the first quarter. Originally, trade was seen reducing GDP by 0.52 percentage point. Businesses increased spending more than previously thought. Outlays rose by 2.9% January through March, an advance bigger than the originally estimated 2.0% increase. Business spending fell 3.1% in the fourth quarter. First-quarter investment in structures increased 5.1%. Equipment and software rose 2.0%. First-quarter spending by consumers advanced 4.4%, up from a previously reported 3.8% increase and above the fourth quarter's 4.2% climb. Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of economic activity. It contributed 3.01 percentage points to GDP in the first quarter; the original estimate was a contribution of 2.66 percentage points. Purchases of durable goods surged 8.8% in January through March, above the previously reported 7.3% increase and double the rate of 4.4% in the fourth quarter. Durable goods are expensive items designed to last at least three years, such as refrigerators. First-quarter non-durables spending rose by 3.5%. Services spending went 4.0% higher. Residential fixed investment, which includes spending on housing, plunged by 15.4% in the first quarter, a smaller drop than the originally estimated 17.0%. Fourth-quarter spending fell by 19.8%. Real final sales of domestic product, which is GDP less the change in private inventories, climbed an unrevised 1.6%. Fourth-quarter sales rose 3.7%. Federal government spending decreased by 3.9%, revised down from an initially estimated 3.0% decline. Fourth-quarter spending rose 4.6%. State and local government outlays rose 3.9%. Revisions to inflation gauges within the report were generally left alone. The government's price index for personal consumption increased 3.3%, below the previously estimated 3.4% advance but above the fourth quarter's 1.0% decrease. The PCE price gauge excluding food and energy rose an unrevised 2.2%, above the fourth quarter's 1.8% increase. The price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices paid by U.S. residents, went up an unchanged 3.6%, which was above the fourth quarter's 0.2% increase. The chain-weighted GDP rose an unrevised 4.0%, above the fourth quarter's 1.7% increase. Copyright C2003, Dow Jones and Company, Inc.

Edwards Chances of Fed Rate Cut Diminish U.S. Firms' Use of Chemical Could Change China Debate HONG KONG -- The use of a potentially dangerous chemical as an animal feed additive by a pair of U.S. companies could shift the terms of a debate now playing out over China's regulation of its food production and exports. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Wednesday said it has alerted manufacturers of feed for livestock, fish and shrimp to a voluntary recall of products made by Tembec BTLSR Inc. of Toledo, Ohio. The FDA said Tembec had added melamine, an agent used in plastics and fire retardants but unfit for use in food, to animal feed agents to improve the product's texture. The FDA said Tembec is a contract manufacturer for another company, Uniscope Inc. of Johnstown, Colo. The FDA said that small amounts of melamine detected in the feed products suggest that the "consumption of pork, chicken, domestic fish and eggs from animals inadvertently fed animal feed contaminated with melamine and its analogues is very unlikely to pose a human health risk." China Refuses Shipment of Evian But the agency said the products made by Tembec and Uniscope also reportedly contained "a urea formaldehyde resin-type ingredient," a raw ingredient used to make the binding agent in these products. The FDA says it is investigating that as well. The findings are likely to have a significant impact because in recent months world-wide alarm over the appearance of melamine in pet food and animal feed has centered on China. Beijing has borne the brunt of global criticism over laxity in supervising its food producers. In late March, the FDA identified a small Chinese manufacturer in Jiangsu province as the source of melamine in wheat flour shipped to the U.S. The chemical was detected in pet food ingredients and linked to a number of deaths in cats and dogs in the U.S., leading to a massive product recall. The FDA yesterday added that "the companies have confirmed that Tembec added melamine as part of the formulation of the products to improve the binding properties of pelleted feed. Melamine is not approved as an additive" for any food, including animal feed. The companies have stopped adding melamine to their products, the FDA said. Tembec BTLSR is a subsidiary of Tembec Inc., a forest products company based in Montreal, Canada, which manufacturers newsprint and chemicals, among other products. Tembec Inc., whose shares are listed on the Toronto stock exchange, reported annual sales of 3.3 billion Canadian dollars in 2006 and a net loss of C$304 million for 2005 and 2006. The company employs around 9,000 people. In its 2006 annual report, Tembec Inc. said that one of its manufacturing facilities located in Toledo, Ohio, manufactures melamine. A man who answered the phone at the office of Tembec BTLSR declined to comment on the FDA report, referring questions to John Valley, an official of the company. A message left for Mr. Valley late Wednesday night in Ohio wasn't immediately returned. Messages left late Wednesday night for officials in the public affairs division of Tembec Inc. also weren't immediately returned. There was no answer at Uniscope's office in Colorado late Wednesday night.

The company carried out a similar level of job cuts at the beginning of the month, for a total of 3023 in this quarter and 3720 for the year, IBM spokesman Edward Barbini said. The cuts amount to roughly 1 per cent of the company's workforce, which totalled 355,000 people at the beginning of the year. But these small numbers reflect a big project inside IBM to transform its business. Services is IBM's biggest division by revenue, but the advent of lower-cost competition overseas has forced IBM to work harder to improve the unit's profit margins. In the first quarter, pre-tax income for IBM's tech services fell 19 per cent, even as revenue rose 7 per cent. Wednesday's job cuts were largely part of the company's response. Although IBM did not disclose where the layoffs were being made, the company had blamed the first-quarter profit shortfall on problems in its US outsourcing business. IBM executives said they expected no more layoffs this quarter. More cuts may follow later in the year. IBM's services overhaul not only involves cheaper labour - IBM's work force in India rose from 9000 in 2003 to 52,000 last year - but also a quest to use less labour, by rethinking or automating the way that services contracts are carried out. Last year, IBM adopted a business-retooling system known as Lean to find such opportunities. Robert Moffat, the IBM executive overseeing Lean, acknowledged it would reduce the need for some services labour, but contended that it would also create new work for the company because customers would be getting more for their money. Even as it has laid off 3700 people this year, IBM has hired 19,000 others. Mr Barbini would not provide a geographic breakdown.

While CBS hopes its $280 million purchase of London-based Last.fm is as successful as the Fox network's ownership of MySpace.com, the goals are different. "We're going to take their core kernel of DNA and see if we can apply it around sports, news and entertainment," among other types of content, said Quincy Smith, president of CBS Interactive. Last.fm is a Web site for music fans that asks users to name their favorite artists and then creates for them a customized radio stream featuring similar tunes. It's called a preference engine, and CBS wants to apply that technology across the various types of content it produces and perhaps tap into a vast library of existing content. "It's not just music that can be streamed," said Martin Stiksel, one of three Last.fm co-founders who will remain with the company. "The scope and vision was always there to expand it out." In 2005, News Corp. bought MySpace, which now has about 56 million unique monthly visitors. Users have profile pages listing their favorite bands, movies and other interests. But the site cannot generate a recommendation for a new band, for instance, like Last.fm. "We wanted to replicate the word-of-mouth model," Stiksel said earlier this year of Last.fm, which began in 2003. "You have a network of friends that plays music you like. You share their interests, and that's essentially what Last.fm does." Stiksel said Wednesday that the company has registered the domain name Last.tv, and Smith confirmed it's something CBS will likely be using in the future. Smith is attracted to Last.fm because it taps into "the wisdom of crowds," a notion that is becoming increasingly influential across the Web. He also likes the site's audience, which Last.fm officially says reaches 15 million users a month worldwide. "It's probably closer to 20 million," Smith said, with only 4.5 million of those users from the U.S. But that taps into another issue for CBS: growing an international audience. "Ninety percent of our revenue is U.S. based," Smith said. "We needed a beachhead &#091;abroad&#093;." That U.S. audience could grow rapidly, however, as Last.fm on Thursday will introduce a new application, or widget, for Facebook.com users to download to their profile pages. It will allow users of Facebook, a social site similar to MySpace, to create personalized music streams their friends can also hear. David Card, an analyst for Jupiter Research, said the deal was a smart one for CBS. "Last.fm is a good product and it has a robust community," he said. "It has one of the few recommendation engines that taps into what I listen to and have" stored on my computer. Amazon.com also has a recommendation engine, he points out, "but that's only based on items I've purchased," not on what the user already owns. Stiksel said the Last.fm technology gives people "control of their entertainment." "We have, with our concept, a way for people to revolutionize how they use media, whether its music, TV or movies." Meanwhile, News Corp.'s Fox Interactive Media unit, which runs MySpace, announced two separate deals to buy sites Photobucket.com and Flektor.com. Photobucket is an application that links personal photos and videos to Web sites, including MySpace, and Flektor lets users edit audio and video content and embed the finished product on a Web site or blog. Financial terms were not disclosed, but sources cited by The Associated Press said Fox was paying about $300 million for Photobucket, about half of the $580 million News Corp. paid for MySpace. ---------- ebenderoff@tribune.com Chicago Bears Super Bowl coverage Wonders of the world 10 for the road Send a news tip What's in it for you?

StumbleUpon Inc. is an online review site that recommends Web pages within sites such as Flickr, MySpace or YouTube, based on "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" votes from other Web users with shared interests. It counts 2.3 million users and is growing at 150 percent a year. The service helps people find Web sites, videos, products, people and other online information according to their tastes. Community members add more than 5 million recommendations per day, meaning StumbleUpon's depth improves the more often it is used. StumbleUpon combines peer recommendations with search features and as such presents an alternative to Web search leader Google Inc. . The recommendation features built into the service could serve as a referral system for eBay users to locate Web auctions that interest them, analysts say. eBay, based in San Jose, California, said it does not expect the StumbleUpon acquisition to have a material effect on its previously stated outlook for 2007 results. In April, the company had forecast full-year profit of $1.30 to $1.34 a share. (c) Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Edwards Inc. for $6.8 billion in cash and stock, creating the second-largest U.S. retail brokerage. The combined brokerage would have about 14,784 brokers, ranking behind Merrill Lynch & Co. ; and $1.15 trillion of client assets, ranking behind Merrill and Citigroup Inc. , Wachovia said.

Wachovia Corp. on Thursday said it would buy A.G. Edwards Inc. for about $6.8 billion in cash and stock to create the second-largest retail brokerage in the United States. REUTERS/Handout Email to a friend "Brokerages are demographically attractive with the anticipated graying of baby boomers and increase in retirement assets," said Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London, in an interview. "Wachovia is also acquiring the advantage of more scale. It can squeeze out a lot of costs, and boost revenue by making brokers more productive and increasing the proportion of fee-based assets." Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia expects to fold A.G. Edwards into its Wachovia Securities brokerage, pushing deeper into 48 of the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. The combined brokerage would be based in St. Louis, home of A.G. Edwards, which was founded in 1887. Wachovia has 8,166 brokers and $773 billion of client assets, while A.G. Edwards has 6,618 brokers and $374 billion of client assets. "Long-term growth opportunities of the brokerage industry are extremely compelling to Wachovia," Wachovia Chief Executive Ken Thompson said in a statement. A.G. Edwards shareholders will receive 0.9844 of a Wachovia share and $35.80 in cash for each of their shares. The terms value A.G. Edwards at $89.50 per share, a 16 percent premium over their Wednesday closing price. A.G. Edwards shares had already risen 22 percent this year. Thursday's transaction comes nearly eight months after Wachovia bought California thrift Golden West Financial Corp. for $24.2 billion, significantly expanding its mortgage operations. A.G. Edwards shares rose $10.10, or 13.1 percent, to $87.25 in pre-market trading. Wachovia shares fell 55 cents to $54.00. has a 38 percent stake in Wachovia Securities, and said it supports the merger. "It's a good deal for Wachovia," said Mark Batty, an analyst at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia, which invests $74 billion. "In retail brokerage, scale is key, and Wachovia will be able to distribute more products more broadly." Wachovia Securities Chief Executive Daniel Ludeman will retain his title, while A.G. Edwards Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Bagby will be chairman. Bagby, reached at his St. Louis office, declined to comment. The transaction values A.G.

Nazem, who joined the company in 1996, said in a statement on Yahoo's Web site that he intends to retire. His last day is scheduled for June 8. The move comes six months after Nazem, 45, was named head of one of the portal's three main business units. Shares of Yahoo fell to $28.24 in after-hours trading from a close of $28.38 on the Nasdaq stock exchange. undergoing a wave of change as it tries to make up ground on archrival Google. Last December, Yahoo's chief operating officer and the head of its entertainment group left as part of an executive shakeup. Google has eclipsed Yahoo in search and advertising. Yahoo's profits slid 11 percent in the first quarter from the year prior. The company's revenue for that period was $1.67 billion, less than half Google's $3.66 billion. A new advertising platform launched in February is supposed to help Yahoo profit more from search, and Nazem said he was waiting to retire until after the system was operating. Jerry Yang, Yahoo's co-founder, will replace Nazem on an interim basis.

If the vessel was Spanish or was removed from Spanish waters, any treasure would belong to Spain, the government says. "Odyssey Marine Exploration has been requested in a letter to provide information concerning the identity of the ship and the material recovered, and has not responded with the details we were asking for," Culture Ministry spokeswoman Susana Tello said. "Spain has decided to go to (the) courts to claim its right in case the discovery is Spanish," she said, adding that the lawsuit was filed May 29 at the Tampa Courts in Florida. Odyssey announced two week ago it had discovered a shipwreck it has code-named "Black Swan" and 500,000 gold and silver coins somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Bush urges 15 major countries set global emission goal by 2008 Zoellick has new agenda for World Bank Bush calls on Congress to increase funds for fighting AIDS The Florida-based company would not say exactly where the ship was or name it, citing security concerns, and said the site was outside any country&#039;s territorial waters. In Britain, the find generated media reports that Odyssey had salvaged the wreck of the long-sought British vessel Merchant Royal, which sank in bad weather off England in 1641. Odyssey has neither confirmed nor denied these reports. Odyssey has said that the ship was not the HMS Sussex, a shipwreck that Odyssey recently got permission from the Spanish government to search for in the Strait of Gibraltar. But Spain has called the new discovery suspicious and said the booty may have come from a wrecked Spanish galleon. Tello said the Kingdom of Spain is represented by the U.S law firm Covington &#038; Burling, which have represented Spain over shipwreck cases before, involving the recovery of material from two ships, Juno and La Galga, in a 2000 court case. The Spanish government won the case at that time.

The growth rate in real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States -- was slower than the 1.3 percent pace originally estimated and the 2.5 percent pace in the final quarter of last year. The new reading disappointed economists who had been expecting a 0.8 percent growth pace for the first three months. The deceleration in real GDP growth in the first quarter primarily reflected an upturn in imports, downturns in exports and in federal government spending, and a deceleration in personal consumption expenditures for non-durable goods, the Commerce Department said. In the first quarter, U.S. exports of goods and services fell by 0.6 percent after having surged 10.6 percent in the previous quarter, while imports of goods and services rose by 5.7 percent, compared to a drop of 2.6 percent in the final quarter of last year. The trade deficit shaved a full percentage point from the GDP in the first quarter. Meanwhile, businesses cut back on inventory investment in the first quarter. That lopped nearly a percentage point off first quarter GDP. Federal government spending decreased by 3.9 percent in the first three months of this year, following an increase of 4.6 percent in the final quarter of last year. The slump in housing market also restrained overall economic activity. Investment in home building dropped by 15.4 percent in the first quarter. But that was not as deep a cut as the 19.8 percent seen in the final quarter of last year. Consumer spending, which accounts for two thirds of overall economic activity, rose by 4.4 percent in the first quarter, the most in a year. In the previous quarter, consumer spending was up 4.2 percent. An inflation gauge tied to the GDP report and closely watched by the Federal Reserve showed that core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy, rose at a rate of 2.2 percent in the first quarter. That was unchanged from its initial estimate but up from a 1.8 percent pace in the fourth quarter of 2006. GDP is considered the best measure of the country's economic fitness. The economy will expand at a pace of 2.3 percent in the second quarter of this year, the National Association for Business Economics predicts.

The drug, known chemically as temsirolimus, is the third such therapy approved since late 2005 for the disease -- the most common form of kidney cancer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. In December 2005, the FDA cleared Bayer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s Nexavar, or sorafenib. In January 2006, Pfizer Inc.'s Sutent, or sunitinib, also won approval. "The group of patients who received Torisel alone showed a significant improvement in overall survival," the FDA said. Wyeth, in a statement, said its drug would be available for patients in July. Shares of the drugmaker earlier closed down 27 cents, or less than 1 percent, at $57.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Company data on Torisel showed that patients who took it alone lived 3.5 months longer overall than those who took it with the cancer drug interferon or a combination of the two, the FDA said.

The Armonk, N.Y.-based company carried out a similar level of job cuts at the beginning of the month, for a total of 3,023 in this quarter and 3,720 for the year, IBM spokesperson Edward Barbini said yesterday. That amounts to roughly 1 per cent of the company's workforce, which included 355,000 people at the beginning of the year. But even these relatively small numbers reflect a big project inside IBM to transform its business. The services division is IBM's biggest division by revenue, but the advent of lower-cost competition overseas has forced IBM to work harder to improve the unit's profit margins. In the first quarter, pre-tax income for IBM's tech services fell 19 per cent, even as revenue rose 7 per cent. Yesterday's job cuts were largely part of the company's response. Although IBM did not disclose where the layoffs were being made, the company had blamed the first-quarter profit shortfall on problems in the company's U.S. outsourcing business. IBM executives say they expect no more layoffs this quarter. But other shifts like this â€“ IBM calls it "rebalancing" â€“ are expected to follow at times. IBM's services overhaul involves cheaper labour; the company's workforce in India rose to 52,000 last year from 9,000 in 2003. But the company is also on a quest to use less labour, rethinking and sometimes automating the ways that services contracts are carried out. Last year, IBM adopted a business-retooling system known as Lean to find such opportunities. Robert Moffat, the IBM executive overseeing Lean, acknowledges it will reduce the need for some services labour, but he contends the system will also create new work for the company overall because customers will be lured by getting more for their money. To some degree, that dynamic could explain another figure disclosed yesterday: that, even as IBM has laid off 3,700 people this year, the company has hired 19,000 others.

For the three months ended May 5, Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears Holdings said net income rose to $216 million, or $1.40 a share, up from $180 million, or $1.14 a share, earned in the year-earlier first quarter. The latest quarter's results were boosted mostly by gains from a legal settlement, a post-retirement benefit and a hurricane-related insurance claim. Adjusted to exclude items from both reporting periods, Sears Holdings' profit disappointed Wall Street, declining to $1.10 a share compared with $1.11 a share last year. Deutsche Bank analyst Bill Dreher called the results "disappointing" but said they weren't disconcerting considering that they were reflective of what close competitors such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw in the quarter and account for a very small piece of Sears Holdings' total fiscal-year picture. "There were clearly elements missing in this performance," Dreher said. "The company has had some hiccups in the past, and this is one of those weak quarters. "Sears Holdings' performance is indicative of weak results for many of the retailers during the first quarter," he said. "In the context of first quarter's contribution to Sears Holdings' annual earnings, it's only about 10%. "The changes that Sears Holdings is making to the long-term fundamentals of the business are good and continue to make progress," he said. Dreher has a buy rating on the stock with a 12-month price target of $238. In the latest quarter, Sears said the legal settlement raised earnings per share by 12 cents, while a change in post-retirement benefits at Sears Canada added 11 cents a share. The recoveries from insurance claims tied to property damage from hurricanes in 2005 accounted for another 6 cents a share and an investment in Sears Mexico netted 8 cents a share. Sears Holdings also had a gain of a penny a share on sales of assets, though the company did not explain what it sold. Partly offsetting these was a loss of 8 cents a share, linked to the derivatives tool called total return swap investments. And for the first quarter since Sears Roebuck and Kmart were merged, the company did not record a restructuring charge. Sales fell 2.5% to $11.7 billion from $12 billion. Sears has conceded that it has lost market share in sales of big appliances such as its Kenmore washers and dryers due to the weakening in housing, but showed gains in children's apparel during the latest quarter. Analysts, on average, had been expecting the company to post a profit of $1.22 a share on revenue of $11.5 billion, according to Thomson Financial. Shares of Sears Holdings sank more than 2% in early trading. Competition and 'external factors' Same-store sales, the industry's important measure of receipts rung up at stores open longer than a year, were off 3.9% in the U.S., reflecting a 3.4% drop at the company's Sears Roebuck stores and a 4.4% decline at its Kmart properties. "We believe these declines reflect both increased competition and the impact of external factors such as rising energy costs, a slower housing market and poor weather conditions during the latter part of the first quarter," the company said in its earnings release. Sears Holdings does not hold conference calls with analysts as do most of its rivals. Ahead of this year's annual meeting, Sears Holdings warned that earnings would miss original projections. It forecast then earnings of $1.30 to $1.53 a share, and net income from $200 million to $235 million. Sears Holdings, flush with cash and borrowing capacity, this month launched major marketing campaigns -- the first since the two retail chains were merged under a single owner. The company said it ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, slightly higher than the $3.2 billion of a year ago but off from $4 billion on Feb. 3. The company said the decline from February is mostly because of increases in inventory as the retailer shifted from the spring to summer selling seasons. At the annual meeting, Sears Chairman Edward Lampert said he was adding $150 million to $200 million of pharmacy products to inventories as he shifted from an outside source to in-store, a move aimed at cutting costs to consumers. Sears Holdings said it spent $113 million on capital expenditures and repaid about $47 million in debt. Also of note, the company didn't repurchase shares during the quarter, leaving it with $604 million in authorization under the existing stock-buyback plan. The company said it did receive about 114,000 shares of common stock as part of bankruptcy-related settlements. Jennifer Waters is a reporter for MarketWatch based in Chicago.

(AP Photo/Odyssey Marine Exploration, Jonathan Blair) By MAR ROMAN Associated Press Writer MADRID, Spain May 31, 2007 (AP) The Spanish government said Thursday it has filed a lawsuit in a U.S. federal court against an American firm over a shipwreck the company has found laden with a colonial-era treasure. If the vessel was Spanish or was removed from Spanish waters, any treasure would belong to Spain, Spain says. "Odyssey Marine Exploration has been requested in a letter to provide information concerning the identity of the ship and the material recovered, and has not responded with the details we were asking for," said Susana Tello, Culture Ministry spokeswoman. "Spain has decided to go to (the) courts to claim its right in case the discovery is Spanish," she added. The lawsuit was filed in Tampa, Fla. on Tuesday, Tello said. A message and e-mail left for an Odyssey spokeswoman were not immediately returned early Thursday. Odyssey announced two weeks ago that it had discovered a shipwreck containing 500,000 gold and silver coins somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. The Florida-based company said the site was outside any country's territorial waters but would not give the exact location or name of the ship. In Britain, the find generated press reports that Odyssey had salvaged the wreck of the long-sought British vessel Merchant Royal, which sank in bad weather off England in 1641. Odyssey has not confirmed or denied these reports. Odyssey has said that the ship was not in Spanish territorial waters and was not HMS Sussex, a shipwreck that Odyssey recently got permission from the Spanish government to search for in the Strait of Gibraltar. But Spain has called the new discovery suspicious and said the booty may have come from a wrecked Spanish galleon. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Despite a healthy dividend, a soaring stock price, a relatively clean environmental record and a management team that's arguably the best in the business, the company still finds itself besieged by investors and the general public alike.

( CNN's Allan Chernoff reports on politicians blaming OPEC for the pain at the pump. (May 29) On Wednesday, activist investors vented at Exxon's annual meeting in Dallas. My big fat American gas tax Items on the agenda included greater restrictions and oversight of executive pay, goals for reducing greenhouse gases, more investment in renewable energy, and a call to put the company's nondiscrimination policy on sexual orientation into writing. None of the 15 shareholder proposals that were up for approval at the meeting won 50 percent of the shareholder vote, but four dealing with pay and governance received at least 40 percent. All four measures would increase the accountability of Exxon management, and the company's board of directors, for their policies and performance. About 47.8 percent of shares voted backed a measure that would give holders of 10 percent of Exxon's outstanding common shares the right to call special shareholder meetings, and 47.2 percent favored a proposal to allow the company to recoup incentive bonuses that weren't justified. Proposals to give shareholders an advisory vote on executive pay and to split the chief executive and chairman positions got 41.2 percent and 40 percent of the vote, respectively. But climate change was the central topic of discussion at the meeting and one environmental proposal - that the company adopt goals for greenhouse gas reductions from its products and operations - received 31 percent of the vote. Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson disputed claims by investor activists and environmentalists that the company is working to mislead the public about the causes of climate change. "What I find perplexing is why people feel threatened because we want to have a discussion," Tillerson told Reuters, when offering an explanation of why the company funds some groups that are skeptical of the mainstream scientific views of climate change. "I'm not going to just adopt a slogan. If that makes me public enemy number one, so be it," he said. About three dozen protesters - outnumbered by police - staged a peaceful demonstration outside the meeting to protest the company's funding of groups the critics believe deny or distort the science of global warming. The protesters waved banners with slogans like "People Before Profits" and chanted "No More Junk Science." "Exxon Mobil is double-crossing the public and policy-makers. It's avoiding real changes and continuing to fund groups that purposefully distort the science of global warming," said Shawnee Hoover, the campaign director of Exxpose Exxon, a coalition of green and scientific groups. Exxpose Exxon says the oil producer still funds about 40 organizations that the environmental group calls "global warming deniers," with Exxon shelling out about $2 million to the groups last year. Exxon disagrees with the claim that the groups, many of which concern themselves with a wide range of issues, are "deniers of climate change." Scientists believe the use of fossil fuels causes global warming. Consumers, faced with record gasoline prices, have also set their sights on the world's largest publicly traded oil company. Several letters calling for boycotts have reportedly been circulating on the Internet. Modeled after the May 15 'Buy no gas" day (widely viewed as ineffective since it simply shifts gas purchases from one to another), the latest round of letters urges urges customers to stop buying gasoline from a particular oil company, often ), for a month or more. The idea is that one oil company will accumulate so much gasoline it will have to slash prices to move inventory, which would in turn spark a price war with other oil companies, lowering gas prices for everyone. "Totally boycott one gas company until their price drops to $ 2.00/gal then only buy that gas until the other oil companies drop their price," wrote one reader to the CNNMoney.com energy blog. "If consumers did this they could literally set the price they pay for fuel." Unfortunately for frustrated motorists, experts say this idea won't work either. First off, just because the service station says Exxon doesn't mean it's Exxon gas. "Exxon doesn't own the service stations, they could care less," said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, which tracks energy prices. Kloza said if the mostly independently owned Exxon service stations stopped selling gasoline, Exxon the oil company would just sell its gasoline in bulk to another retailer, like Even today, Exxon will ship its gasoline to another retailer in a different part of the country if Exxon has an oversupply and the other retailer has a shortage. "They are all using the same gasoline, it's a fungible commodity," said Peter Beutel, oil analyst at Cameron Hanover. "It's like shoveling water," he said of the proposed boycott. "It wouldn't do a thing." Worse, if a service station did close due to a boycott, it might actually force prices higher as fewer competitors could lead to rising prices, he added. Both Kloza and Beutel said reducing demand was the best way to lower prices. Kloza said if every American used 4 ounces less gasoline a day, it would significantly bring down prices. Beutel said cutting out one out of every 20 trips - by carpooling or consolidating errands - would reduce gasoline demand by 4 percent a year and knock up to $1 a gallon off the retail price. "The minute gasoline demand goes negative, people start freaking out and selling gas futures," he said. - Reuters contributed to this report Gas prices: The new Salem witch trials Cheapest gas in the nation - full service 5 ways to fix Wal-Mart Northwest to emerge from bankruptcy Fixing the food fiasco Wow, I could've had a prime mortgage 10 great job markets for techies Cards that pay big-time rewards Stocks on the rise Economic growth slowest since '02 Wii will rock you Doomed GM plant is nation's most productive * : Time reflects local markets trading time. &#8224; - Intraday data delayed 15 minutes for Nasdaq, and 20 minutes for other exchanges. &copy; 2007 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York said the shelters were "to be used by wealthy individuals with taxable income generally in excess of $10 or $20 million to eliminate or reduce the taxes they would have to pay" to the Internal Revenue Service. Prosecutors a variety of criminal charges were filed against the four, including conspiracy, obstruction of the IRS, false statements and tax evasion. Ernst & Young said in a statement that those charged include two former partners and two partners who have been on administrative leave. They were part of a small group within the firm, disbanded years ago, that was responsible for developing the transactions in question, the company said. None of the individuals was part of the firm's management, it added. The accounting firm said it was cooperating with investigators and has "voluntarily made many changes and enhancements to our tax practice. We have also made other changes to our tax practice pursuant to our 2003 agreement with the IRS." Charged were Robert Coplan, 54, a former tax partner and national director for wealth planning, as well as Martin Nissenbaum, 51, national director of the firm's personal income-tax and retirement practice. Richard Shapiro, 58, and Brian Vaughn, 39, also were charged. All of the defendants were at one time members of Ernst & Young's Value Ideas Produce Extraordinary Results group, also known as Viper. The group was later named Strategic Individual Solutions Group, or SISG, according to court documents. David Weidner covers Wall Street for MarketWatch.

This drug has been found to prolong the survival of advanced renal carcinoma patients by about 3 Â½ months, according to a study led by Gary R. Hudes, M.D., director of the Genitourinary Malignancies Program at Fox Chase Cancer Center. The study has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine. A total of 626 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were enrolled in the study and were subjected to one of the following three treatments â€“ the new drug Torisel, an older drug called interferon, or both the drugs together. The patients who received Torisel alone survived longer than those who received interferon, the usual or â€˜standardâ€™ treatment for this disease. According to this study, the greatest increase in median survival was observed in patients receiving Torisel (49 percent) compared with patients treated with interferon only. Patients treated with Torisel and interferon combined had a 15 percent increase in median survival compared with interferon alone. The median survival for Torisel alone was 10.9 months compared with and 8.4 months for the Torisel and interferon, and 7.3 months for the interferon. "This is the first study to show that a new drug can improve overall survival for patients with metastatic renal cell cancer," said Hudes. Renal Cell Carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer, accounting for about 90% of all adult kidney cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S. Many patients with kidney cancer opt for a surgery to remove the tumor. However, about 35% of them experience either a recurrence of the tumor or its spread to other organs. â€œFor these patients, the goal of treatment is to prevent further spread and growth of the cancer, and ideally, to reduce that amount of cancer," Hudes said. "Until recently, physicians lacked effective drugs to control the disease." The drug Torisel is basically an enzyme inhibitor, a protein that regulates cell production, growth and survival. Temsirolimus blocks the function of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key protein within cells regulating cell proliferation, growth and survival. It has also been found to block angiogenesis, the process to create a blood supply to tumors in order to maintain their growth. This is the third drug for kidney cancer to be approved by FDA since late 2005, the earlier two being Bayerâ€™s Nexavar, or sorafenib and Pfizer Inc.'s Sutent, or sunitinib. Common side effects of Torisel include rash, fatigue, mouth sores, nausea, edema and a loss of appetite. Common laboratory abnormalities associated with the drug are high blood sugar, elevated blood lipids and tryglycerides, low RBC, WBC and platelet counts. Also, this study focused on patients with the most advanced tumors. According to Hudes, Torisel can be expected to provide greater benefits to patients with less extensive metastatic disease. Wyeth, in a statement, said its drug would be available for patients in July. The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

http://www.twincities.com/business/ci_6024065&cid TwinCities.com - Ceridian to be sold for $5.3 billion Working Q & A Ceridian to be sold for $5.3 billion Under pressure from key investor, company agrees to private buyout Article Last Updated: 05/30/2007 09:43:37 PM CDT After months of pressure from an unhappy shareholder, Ceridian Corp. said Wednesday that it will be sold for $5.3 billion to Thomas H. Lee Partners, a private-equity group, and Fidelity National Financial Inc. Ceridian, which provides human-resources and computer-processing services for business clients, will keep its headquarters in Bloomington, and Kathryn Marinello will remain as CEO, a company spokesman said Wednesday. The company employs about 1,000 people in Minnesota. After a review of "strategic alternatives" aimed at providing maximum value to the company's shareholders, Ceridian's board decided that a sale "represents the best and most certain way to achieve that goal," L. White Matthews, chairman of Ceridian's board, said in a release Wednesday. The deal will pay Ceridian shareholders $36 cash per share, a 5 percent premium over Wednesday's closing price of $34.19. In a release about the deal, Ceridian noted that the price represents a 17 percent premium over the closing stock price on Feb. 12, the day before Ceridian announced it was exploring strategic alternatives. News of the deal came after the market's close, but most of the increase already had been built into the stock. Ceridian shares went up another $1.41 to $35.60 in after-hours trading. Ceridian traces its corporate lineage back to Control Data Corp. and now is among the largest human-resources outsourcing companies. Despite steady growth, the company ran into difficulties with its largest investor earlier this year. William Ackman, who heads Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund that owns 14 percent of Ceridian's outstanding shares, demanded in January that Ceridian spin off its profitable Comdata division. He publicized his demands after a face-to-face meeting with Marinello left him unsatisfied with the company's direction. Marinello had taken over as CEO last fall. Ackman also is proposing his own slate of candidates for the company's board of directors. Shareholders will vote on board members at Ceridian's annual meeting, which has yet to be scheduled. The deal announced Wednesday will get a vote from shareholders at the annual meeting as well, Ceridian said. The meeting will be scheduled "as soon as practicable following the filing and review of proxy materials," the company's release said, and will take place no later than Sept. 21. While Ceridian remained profitable, its larger human-resources division was seen as a laggard compared with the smaller Comdata division, which processes and issues credit, debit and gift cards, primarily for trucking and retail customers in the United States. In 2005, for instance, Comdata generated 28 percent of Ceridian's revenue, but 74 percent of Ceridian's operating earnings. Earlier this month, Ceridian fired Gary Krow, the president of the Comdata division, after he allegedly provided Pershing Square with confidential information. In a release earlier this month, Ackman said that Krow had told him in January that he was planning to leave Comdata because his authority had been diminished and because he disagreed with the strategic direction of Ceridian. Attempts to reach Ackman by phone Wednesday for comment on the Ceridian deal were unsuccessful. Thomas H. Lee Partners and Fidelity National will each own roughly half of Ceridian when the deal is done, and each expects to bring in co-investors. "We are extremely impressed with Kathy Marinello and the management team of Ceridian," said Scott Jaeckel, managing director of Thomas H. Lee Partners. "We fully support their vision and commitment to all of Ceridian's customers and employees." The deal will bring some uncertainty to Ceridian employees, though. In a QA e-mail sent to employees Wednesday, one question asked about any work-force reductions resulting from the deal. Ceridian answered that it will "continue to evaluate the resources required to implement the company's strategic plan and will make adjustments as necessary." Thomas H. Lee Partners has about $12 billion in equity capital invested in more than 100 businesses. Its deals have given it a stake in West Corp., Dunkin Brands, Fisher Scientific, Experian and Snapple Beverage. Fidelity National is a leading provider of title and specialty insurance.

The ACLU lawsuit alleges that the subsidiary, California-based Jeppesen DataÂ­plan, provided the CIA with services for flights that were used to send three prisoners to secret detention facilities where they claim they were tortured. According to the ACLU complaint, Binyam MohÂ­amed, an Ethiopian, Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian, and Abou Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen, were all subject to the CIA renditions programme, in which prisoners are captured in one country and sent to CIA overseas secret detention sites, or to other countries' intelligence services, for interrogation. "We are filing this lawsuit on behalf of three individuals who have been repeatedly tortured, terrified, humiliated and deprived of their basic human rights," said Anthony Romero, the executive director of the ACLU. "American companies should not be profiting from a CIA rendition programme that is unlawful and contrary to core American values." President George W. Bush conceded the existence of the secret detention sites last year. The ACLU says Mr Agiza is imprisoned in Egypt, while Mr Britel is being held in Morocco. An Italian judge has dismissed all charges of suspected terrorism against Mr Britel. Dozens of members of the Italian parliament have petitioned Morocco over his release. As part of its case, the ACLU cites comments by a senior Jeppesen Dataplan executive in a New Yorker magazine article, in which he says the company "do all of the extraordinary rendition flights â€“ you know, the torture flights". The CIA and Boeing both declined to comment on the lawsuit. In a related case, the ACLU also petitioned the Supreme Court on Wednesday over the case of Khaled al-Masri, a Lebanese-born German who was captured in Macedonia in December 2003 and allegedly held until May 2004 by the CIA in a secret prison in Afghanistan. A federal court dismissed a previous lawsuit that accused George Tenet, the former CIA director, of violating human rights laws by authorising CIA operatives to capture Mr Masri. The court agreed to dismiss the case on the grounds that it could compromise state secrets. A former intelligence official told the FT that Mr Tenet's office had agreed to apprehend Mr Masri despite warnings from senior intelligence operatives that he had no connection with the "war on terror" and that his name "al-Masri", which translates as "the Egyptian," was a common name in the Middle East. The ACLU alleges that Jeppesen provided logistics services, such as flight planning, catering and hotel accommodation for crew, for more than 70 rendition flights involving two aircraft over a four-year period. The lawsuit also accuses Jeppesen of providing services for the flight used to transport Mr Masri. Copyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ernst & Young partners charged with tax fraud Big four accountancy firm latest to be caught by massive US criminal investigation into tax shelters for the wealthy Michael Herman and Robert Lindsay Four current and former partners of accounting firm Ernst & Young were today charged with tax fraud conspiracy and other crimes relating to tax shelters for wealthy clients. The charges are the latest in a long-running criminal investigation by the Inland Revenue Service and the US Department of Justice which has already seen rival big four firm KPMG having to settle for $456 million and one of its former partners charged with fraud. Two of the men charged today are still senior partners at Ernst & Young but have been placed on "administrative leave". They are Martin Nissenbaum, national director of Ernst & Young's personal income tax and retirement planning practice and tax partner Richard Shapiro. The other two are former E&Y partners Robert Coplan, a lawyer from Texas who previously served in the IRS&rsquo; Legislation and Regulations Division and Brian Vaughn, an accountant from Louisiana. KPMG faces US criminal investigation KPMG counts cost of being too aggressive Ex-chief at KPMG charged with fraud All four worked in a group set up by the company in 1998 to develop tax shelters, according to an indictment filed in US District Court in Manhattan. They allegedly defrauded the Internal Revenue Service from 1998 through 2004 by designing, marketing and selling fraudulent tax vehicles. US Attorney Michael Garcia said in a statement that the criminal indictment targets &ldquo;tax professionals whose deceit costs this country untold millions in tax revenues.&rdquo; The charges follow other a long running probe by the Inland Revenue Service and a criminal probe by the Department of Justice into potentially illegal tax shelters which has already led to KPMG's former deputy chairman, Jeffrey Stein, being charged among nine others for allegedly designing illegal tax shelters to help clients of KPMG to avoid paying more than $1 billion (&pound;560 million) of tax. According to today's indictment, the defendants created documents containing false and fraudulent descriptions of the clients&rsquo; motivations for entering into the transactions to hide the tax fraud from the IRS. The partners enticed clients to participate in the shelters by getting law firms to provide letters claiming that the tax shelter losses or deductions would &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo; survive IRS challenge, the court papers said. They were charged with conspiracy to defraud the IRS, tax evasion, making false statements and impeding and impairing the lawful functioning of the IRS. The IRS has spent a year trying to force more than 90 accountancy firms, law firms, insurance companies, banks and brokerages to disclose the names of customers and their tax arrangements. It has filed lawsuits against several accountancy firms, including KPMG, for refusing to hand over the details. PricewaterhouseCoopers paid an undisclosed sum to settle tax shelter abuses dating back to the mid-1990s. Ernst & Young recently agreed to a $15 million fine and said that it would provide the IRS with full information about clients. KPMG's Jeffrey Stein, retired at the end of last November.

Spain wants details of shipwreck treasure Thursday 31st May, 2007 Spain has launched legal action over a shipwreck containing $500 million in coins. There have been rumors that the wreck was found off Spain, although the salvagers, Odyssey Marine Exploration who describe the wreck only as a 17th Century vessel, purportedly found it off the coast of England. They will not say exactly where it was found and wonâ€™t respond to any information requested by Spain. A lawyer for the Spanish government says if the vessel was Spanish, any treasure would belong to Spain and the firm could be guilty of plundering. The Kingdom of Spain has already won cases involving the recovery of material from two ships, Juno and La Galga. Odyssey has so far sent 17 tons of coins recovered from the wreck back to the U.S. for authentication.

Stellar Emery not enough for Sens Rodriguez helps talk Yankees into a win Planting trees good for the conscience Mackenzie pipeline 'not economical,' Exxon says Claudia Cattaneo And Jon Harding, Financial Post, with files from news services Published:Â Thursday, May 31, 2007 CALGARY - Exxon Mobil Corp. has sent out the strongest message yet that it is backing out of plans to build a natural gas pipeline down the Mackenzie Valley. Rex Tillerson, Exxon chief executive, said yesterday rising costs have made the project difficult to carry out. "It may just be that this project will have to wait for a different cost environment," Mr. Tillerson said after the company's annual meeting in Dallas. "It's not economical at this point." Rex Tillerson, CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp., told reporters at a news conference following Exxon's shareholders' meeting in Dallas yesterday that the Mackenzie pipeline project is not viable. Email to a friend He said he didn't know whether the federal government could create "enough room in the fiscal structure" to accommodate the rising costs. That's a sharply different message from barely 18 months ago in Calgary, when Mr. Tillerson was keen to develop Arctic resources to meet global energy needs. He said at the time: "It's a long process and there is lots of interests that have to be addressed, but we continue to make good progress and my expectation is that we will ultimately get across the finish line with this thing." Since then, the project's costs have more than doubled, but the oil companies proposing it, headed by Exxon Mobil affiliate Imperial Oil Ltd., also made headway in solving issues with aboriginal groups. Meanwhile it nearly completed a marathon of regulatory hearings across the North. The oil companies' drive to move forward appears to have hit a wall in negotiations for fiscal terms with Ottawa. The companies were looking for billions in breaks, but the federal government has said no. The National Post reported two weeks ago that Ottawa is exploring taking control of the $16.2-billion project and buying out the oil company consortium as a way to salvage the major northern infrastructure development. Talks along those lines are continuing, sources say. Another plan being considered involves TransCanada Corp., Canada's largest pipeline company, owning the pipeline with the Aboriginal Pipeline Group (APG), an aboriginal group with a one-third interest in the project, with financial support from the federal government. Fred Carmichael, chairman of the APG, said as far as the APG is concerned, it will do everything it can to keep the project alive. Mr. Carmichael would not discuss the status of talks between the partners and Ottawa. Jim Prentice, the federal Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, has vehemently denied the project is dead or that the federal government is considering getting involved financially. Imperial also said it is still committed to the project. Cathy Cram, spokeswoman for ConocoPhillips, another partner, said Mr. Tillerson has not changed his views. "We don't believe he is saying anything different than he has been saying in the last number of months," she said. A spokesman for Exxon Mobil, Mark Boudreaux, said the project is not viable under the current fiscal regime. "We are continuing to work with the partners and the federal government to see if we can identify a commercial project to move forward," he said. Mr. Tillerson was equally pessimistic about the Alaska natural- gas pipeline, another giant project to ship gas from Alaska to the United States. He said that although Exxon has not done any recent cost studies for a proposed pipeline in Alaska, he believes those costs would have risen dramatically as well. Costs were between US$22- billion and US$25-billion about three years ago, when the company did its last estimate, Mr. Tillerson said. "It involves lots of steel, lots of compressors, lots of valves, all the same things you need for the Canadian project," he said. Â© National Post 2007 John Mayer acts out a bizarre ...

Colby has been forced out as chief financial officer after violating the insurance company's code of conduct. WellPoint declined to say what the violation was. The news comes a day before Executive Vice President Angela Braly takes over as CEO from Larry Glasscock, who will remain as chairman. Company executives said during a conference call with analysts that Colby's resignation had nothing to do with the transition. Braly didn't elaborate on the reasons for Colby's departure other than to say the violation he committed was of a "non-business nature." Glasscock did say the investigation found no illegal conduct, and Colby's actions "in no way related to the company's performance or financial condition, both of which remain strong." During the conference call, an analyst asked whether Colby was offered a second chance, since no law was broken. Glasscock said the chief financial officer was treated like any employee. Glasscock declined to comment on whether the violation was a repeat offense. Wayne S. DeVeydt, chief accounting officer since March 2005, was named chief financial officer.

Late Wednesday, the Minneapolis-based payroll and tax filing services provider said it agreed to sell itself to Thomas H. Lee Partners LP and Fidelity National Financial Inc. for $36 per share cash. The proposal represents a premium of a little more than 5 percent over the stock's closing price of $34.19 Wednesday. Ceridian's stock rose $1.26, or 3.7 percent, to $35.45 in premarket trading Thursday. "Some investors were expecting a larger premium," JPMorgan Securities analyst Tien-tsin Huang wrote in a client note. But analysts said most of the takeover premium has already been built into the shares because investors anticipated a deal. The stock closed Wednesday up 22.2 percent for the year. In December, an investment fund called Pershing Square Capital Management LP became Ceridian's biggest shareholder, with a stake that now totals 14.5 percent of the company's outstanding shares, and began agitating for change. In February, the company hired Greenhill & Co. LLC as a financial adviser to help "explore a broad range of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value." The Thomas H. Lee/Fidelity National offer represents a 17.2 percent premium to the stock's price before that announcement. "The sale of the company was already broadly speculated in the market and largely captured in the stock," said Goldman Sachs analyst Elizabeth W. Grausam. Grausam said rampant takeover speculation has pushed up stock prices across the sector, "leaving little room for robust takeout premiums." Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Wealth managers and private banks are expanding to meet the demand from the growing numbers of affluent but â€œtime-poorâ€ investors who want professionals to manage their money for them and treat them as a name and not an account number. The bracket between Â£100,000 and Â£250,000 is below the traditional private banking threshold of Â£500,000 but private banks and wealth managers see this sector as the fastest-growing segment of the market. Many of the private banks, several of them acquired recently by high street banks, are targeting the newly affluent. They want to reach a new generation of high- earning clients who are growing in number by 7-10 per cent a year, according to research by business strategy consultants MDRC. The growth of wealth management and private banking is in contrast to dwindling branch networks and declining service offered by the high street banks. The private banks and wealth managers are opening new offices. Lloyds TSB has started opening private banking lounges in high street branches around the UK to offer an exclusive service to its clients. Recent openings include Richmond Upon Thames and the Law Courts in London. Many of the private banks and wealth managers promise old-fashioned personal service â€“ if they like the size of your portfolio. Lloyds TSB Private Banking has 45,000 clients and targets those with assets of Â£250,000 or more but will consider those below, especially those with potential to add to their wealth. It will also take on clients with Â£100,000 who want to use its asset management service. Independent financial advisers are targeting the affluent too and enjoy the biggest wealth management market share at 33 per cent. US-based wealth manager and stockbroker Edward Jones is expanding rapidly and already has more than 100 offices in the UK, the fastest-growing â€œmass affluentâ€ market in Europe. As the banks and wealth managers have stepped up their services, research suggests that the demographics of the sector are changing rapidly. The number of traditionally wealthy, passing family wealth between generations, is static and has been overtaken by growth in the high- earner category. Many of these are City workers enjoying high salaries and bonuses and those running their own businesses. MDRC chief executive Richard Williams says that growth in the high-earner category has reduced the average age of newly affluent investors from 55 to 47 over the past decade. Despite the growth in private banking and wealth management, one in five affluent investors remains suspicious of external wealth managers and prefers a DIY approach. Some are concerned about the quality of advice and high fees. More people are being persuaded, however, that the time saving alone can make it worth considering a professional wealth manager. Among the new clients of wealth managers are Alan Hunter, 61, and John Haddrell, 45, directors of thriving property rental business Midway in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. As their business grew rapidly along with their personal assets they decided to turn to advisory firm Edward Jones. Their Edward Jones investment representative Vik Sharma regularly visits them at their office and homes. Haddrell, who has a portfolio of more than Â£300,000, says he had previously spent up to seven hours a week managing his own investments. He decided to seek a wealth manager after realising he was spending too much time watching the stock markets and not enough running his business. â€œI was reticent at first to use an adviser because I was concerned about the quality of advice. But I realised that running a business makes life very busy and itâ€™s nice to know somebody is keeping an eye on your investments for you all the time,â€ he says. John Hutchinson, 62, a retired chief executive of a music copyright business, and his wife Elspeth, 60, from Essex, became clients of Lloyds TSB Private Banking last year. Lloyds manages their joint Â£400,000 portfolio and provides tax and trust advice including advice on their two French properties. Barclays Private Banking targets those with more than Â£500,000 but its Premier Banking Service caters for those earning over Â£100,000 or with Â£50,000-plus to invest. HSBC Private Banking offers worldwide offices and Royal Bank of Scotland has expanded its private banking service by acquiring Coutts and Adam & Company. Other private banks include C Hoare & Co, Butterfield Private Bank, Brown Shipley & Co and NM Rothschild & Sons. As the sector has become more competitive, many private banks have added services including independent financial advice, trust and taxation planning and family wealth transfer advice. All offer a personal â€œrelationshipâ€ manager who promises that you will always be a name, not a number. Private banks are not the only providers of wealth management services. There is a growing queue of specialist wealth managers and independent financial advisers targeting the Â£100,000- plus bracket. The Association of Private Client Investment Managers (Apcims) lists more than 200 member firms and the number is growing. Firms offering wealth management services include financial adviser John Scott & Partners, Close Bros, Tilney Investment Management, Killik & Co, and Brewin Dolphin. Andrew Fisher is the chief executive of financial planning business John Scott & Partners, an Apcims member. It has 12 offices, 165 planners and 200,000 clients in the UK. He is a former chief executive of Coutts. He believes that DIY clients in the newly affluent category in particular should give serious consideration to using a wealth manager not just to provide time-saving, professional management but also to provide an valuable external eye on their portfolios. He warns that like medicine, â€œself diagnosisâ€ can be damaging to your financial health. The costs of wealth management will depend on the type of wealth manager but it is worth remembering that the larger the portfolio the lower the annual management percentage fee should be and that fees can be negotiable. Annual charges for portfolio management typically range from 1-2 per cent and private banks will usually charge Â£10-Â£30 per month in bank account fees but will often waive this if large sums are invested.

Miller May 30 (Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines Corp., the world&#39;s largest computer-services company, cut about 1,570 jobs mainly in its technology services unit, where profit fell 19 percent in the latest quarter. Most of the reductions were in North America and workers were notified today, according to Edward Barbini, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM. The division accounted for more than a third of IBM&#39;s $22 billion in sales in the first quarter. Today&#39;s cuts are equal to about 1.2 percent of the U.S. workforce. This month IBM also trimmed about 1,300 jobs at its global services unit, which incorporates the technology division, to help reduce expenses in the U.S., where IBM has about 128,000 employees. In the technology unit, first-quarter gross margin, the percentage of sales left after production costs, was unchanged from a year earlier, IBM said last month. IBM shares rose $1.02 to $106.93 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have gained 10 percent this year. Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is targeting software, whose sales are growing faster than revenue from services, to help fuel profit growth. IBM aims to get about half its earnings from software by 2010, he said earlier this month. The company also has sought to spur increases by buying back stock, and yesterday said it repurchased about $12.5 billion in shares since announcing the program last month, equal to more than 80 percent the amount planned. IBM bought back 118.8 million shares, or 8 percent of outstanding common stock, at an initial price of $105.18 per share. The move may help boost 2007 earnings per share by 13 percent to 14 percent, IBM said. IBM has cut about 3,000 jobs this quarter, and had 355,800 employees as of last year. Lee Conrad, national coordinator for the Alliance at IBM, estimated that job cuts may reach 12,000 this year, saying the company has moved work overseas. His group, which he says has 400 dues-paying and 5,500 non-paying members, is seeking union recognition at IBM. Barbini declined to comment on further possible reductions. IBM has hired 14,000 workers globally this year, he said. He declined to say how many people are employed in the technology services division. To contact the reporter on this story: Matthew R.

The branch manager of the Bank of America called police about 10 a.m. after receiving a fax containing images of a lit match and a bomb with a fuse, bank spokesman Ernesto Anguilla said. But text explaining the fax was an internal bank promotion failed to transmit. The missing text included the phrases "The countdown begins" and "Small business commitment week June 4-8," according to a copy circulated by police. "The fax machine malfunctioned, so a partial image came through that looked somewhat suspicious," Anguilla said. Fears also arose because the branch received a suspicious package delivered by a customer around the same time, police said. A State Police bomb squad searched the bank branch and checked out the package, which was a delivery of documents. About 15 small businesses in a shopping plaza were evacuated for about three hours, including a day care center with about 30 children, Police Chief Scott Rohmer said. The fax was sent to the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank's branches in parts of New England, New York and New Jersey. It did not result in any other bomb scares at other branches, Anguilla said.

Edwards for .8 Billion - Mergers, Acquisitions, Venture Capital, Hedge Funds -- DealBook - New York Times tag, as close to the beginning of it as possible--> Wachovia to Buy A.G. Edwards for $6.8 Billion May 31, 2007, 7:08 am said Thursday it would buy for $6.8 billion in cash and stock, forming the second-largest retail stock brokerage in the United States after . The deal for St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards marks the latest big grab for Wachovia Securities, Wachovia&#8217;s brokerage unit, which nearly doubled in size in 2003 when it took control of With the addition of A.G. Edwards, Wachovia Securities will have more than 3,300 brokerage locations nationwide, more than $1.1 trillion in client assets and nearly 15,000 financial advisers. The combined retail brokerage business will operate out of St. Louis, Wachovia said, while A.G. Edwards&#8217;s other lines of business, including stock research and investment banking, will be folded into Charlotte, N.C.-based Wachovia&#8217;s current operations. Wachovia Securities was formed in 2003 through a joint venture with Prudential that did not involve any payment by Wachovia. That transaction put the brokerage firm in third place in the United States, behind Merrill and . (Prudential still owns a 38 percent stake in Wachovia Securities.) Thursday&#8217;s deal, which will place Wachovia ahead of Citi in terms of size, involves a significant outlay of cash and stock: It calls for A.G. Edwards&#8217;s shareholders to get 0.9844 Wachovia shares and $35.80 in cash per A.G. Edwards share, valuing their stock at $89.50, a 16 percent premium over Wednesday&#8217;s closing price. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2007, Wachovia said. Wachovia, formed through a series of mergers over the years, has been expanding on the banking side as well. Last year, it bought Golden West Financial, one of the last major independent banks on the West Coast, in a $26 billion deal. Daniel J. Ludeman, currently president and chief executive of Wachovia Securities, will keep those roles at the combined brokerage firm. A.G. Edwards&#8217;s chairman and chief executive, Robert Bagby, will be chairman of the enlarged brokerage firm.

Great for Chris Gammon Wachovia&#8217;s new partner â€” Posted by Vivian I Gammon Assuming Wachovia got the buyout numbers right, as a shareholder think this is a very smart acquisition. An A.G. Edwards&#8217; office caught my attention when I attended a GOP county meeting the other day in a prosperous very small town Iowa county seat. Aside from a couple of local banks, it&#8217;s the only real financial game in town. â€” Posted by MARK KLEIN, M.D. As an employee of A.G. it leaves me with many questions but as a shareholder I&#8217;m pleased! I kind of take pride in the A.G. Edwards name. I hope that this doesn&#8217;t bring down the reputation the company has built up. â€” Posted by Tina Wachovia has a brilliant long term strategy. Little by little, step by step, year by year, they are setting the stage to becoming a true national bank, instead of just regional (East coast plus Texas and Calif.) They wait for the right time and the right price and they pounce. It may take another 10 years, but this is one well run and smart company. Kudos&#8230; â€” Posted by Ted Koppel Not in agreement here. Looking closely there are only the optics of a strategy that would truly work in the 1980&#8217;s but not going forward. It embraces size but not necessarily change much less agility. Wacovia management tends to say yes to many projects and investments without close, intelligent internal scrutiny. Too much Carolina Pride and not enough questioning and real creativity or foresight. This is a Citbank/Legg deal at very best&#8230;. and I am not impressed by the Edwards offices or brokers. Too much freedom and not enough solid client contact or production. The only people doing well are Edwards stockholders taking an exit.. â€” Posted by Hank I am very happy to see this since I am a client of Wachovia Securities. Perhaps it will enhance my portfolio. â€” Posted by Joel K. Joness As a twenty-year AGEdwards retail brokerage customer, I am concerned about Wachovia&#8217;s influence on the firm. I do not have a favorable impression of Wachovia&#8217;s customer service from my experience as a retail customer of theirs; nor do I find their track record on ethics and corporate responsibility to be acceptable iin order to win my business back. While cost savings from the merger might be desireable, I perceive no other benefits to size for the retail customer. I expect to vote against the merger with my feet. While i-bankers, shareholders and corporate officers might be pleased by the lucrative transaction, they should wonder about the impact on long-term shareholder value of departures of customers like me. â€” Posted by Andrew McLean To investors of AGE, this should be a positive move or neutral at best. With AGE as well as Wachovia, customers are served by individual Financial Consultants and your relationship with them does not need to change. Wachovia does have a much broader platform and access to more types of financial securities - private equity, hedge, alternative investments. I am a customer of Wachovia as a byproduct of prior mergers. Same Financial Advisor - initially with Everen, then Prudential and now Wachovia. And I&#8217;m very happy with the platform. â€” Posted by Jim McGhee I have to question the strategy here. Wachovia seems out of focus with their insurance operations - it&#8217;s simply dying on the vine. It may be they are purchasing the talent to run their operations properly and get the most out of what they have already in place. If it ends up that AGE management takes over key positions in Wachovia then it was smart. If it goes the other way and AGE talent goes elsewhere then the move was pure folly. â€” Posted by Warren Buffet As former A.G.Edwards 7 Sons financial advisor in Maryland I think that this is yet another loss for middle class investors as Bank of America/Mations Bank now Wachovia aqusition frenzy inevitably and clearly prefers practices and operational style which in general and to a significant degree damages the best interest of retail clientele, here AGE customers. Subsequently to my work with AGE I was with Fleet Bank here at North East and I had the opportunity to witness BoA unscurpulosu impsition of their corporate &#8220;culture&#8221; on this rather sucessful regional financial institution. Treatment of Fleet&#8217;s clients naturally did not improve, victim of &#8220;:aquisition at any cost to customers as long as it enriches management&#8221; philosophy. â€” Posted by Sid Edward Jones here I come!!!!!!!! â€” Posted by Customer Wachovia really needs to work on their customer service and customer relations as it grows to that &#8221; too big to be customer friendly&#8221; status. A.G. Edwards has always meant quality. Wachovia can learn a lot from them. â€” Posted by JOHN W.

BEA also released its first estimate of first-quarter corporate profits. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) The deceleration in first-quarter GDP growth primarily reflected a downturn in net exports. First-quarter corporate profits increased 6.3 percent from the same quarter a year ago. In the fourth quarter, profits grew 18.3 percent.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted U.S. Company Used Melamine in Feed Humans Unlikely to Be Harmed Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, May 31, 2007; Page A03 company has long been adding the industrial toxin melamine to animal feed ingredients, and those feeds have been eaten by livestock and fish meant for human consumption, officials with the Food and Drug Administration The company used the chemical as a binding agent to hold feed granules in pellet form, in contrast to the recent pet food scandal, which involved imported ingredients that were spiked with melamine to provide a false measure of protein content, officials said. View Post coverage of the pet food contamination responsible for several pet deaths. Pet Food Claims Animal Lives A widespread contamination of pet food has been linked to the deaths of several dogs and cats and thousands of reports of sick animals throughout the country. In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article But as with the pet food scandal, they said, the levels of melamine involved appear to be too low to harm humans who may have eaten animals that consumed the tainted feed. The company, Tembec BTLSR of , sold the melamine-laden ingredients to Uniscope of , which used them to make three finished food products -- one for cattle, sheep and goats, and two for fish and shrimp. The contamination came to the FDA's attention on May 18 after Uniscope officials tested for melamine in the feed components they were buying -- something the FDA has been encouraging food producers to do. The FDA began an investigation the next working day, officials said, and after about 10 days decided how to proceed. Officials said that Tembec initiated a formal recall of its products yesterday and that the company has stopped adding the chemical. It remains unclear why Tembec did not stop using melamine months ago, given the intense publicity generated by the recent pet food scandal, during which officials repeatedly made it clear that melamine is not an approved additive for human or animal food. "What they knew and didn't know before will be part of the investigation as it unfolds," , the FDA's assistant commissioner for food protection, said during a telephone news conference yesterday. For now, he said, "it's speculation in terms of motives and who knew what." Officials said they do not know how many animals may have eaten the food or how long melamine has been used to make pellets. But the presumption, Acheson said, is that it has been a long-standing practice. Melamine levels in the companies' livestock feed were so low that they did not pose a risk to the animals, or to consumers, Acheson said. Levels in the fish and shrimp feed were high enough to raise some concerns about those animals, but are still "very unlikely to pose a human health risk," he added. Acheson said that the two fish feed products, which Tembec made for Uniscope using tainted ingredients, were exported. The FDA is trying to track the amounts shipped and to find out what countries those feeds went to. He said it is not known whether -- which has suffered significant political damage in recent months for having been caught exporting melamine-tainted pet food ingredients to the -- was among the countries that may have received the melamine-tainted U.S. products.

IBM in 2006 alone added some 19,000 employees around the world. The layoffs underscore the company's ongoing shift of resources toward outsourcing locations, and its effort to embrace business lines with robust profits. – The Reliable Workhorses for Business – are built on the legendary LaserJet printer technology, delivering exceptional print quality, performance and reliability. Trade in your old desktop printer today to receive up to $500 back by mail has cut more than 1,500 additional jobs from its information technology services unit, the company said Wednesday. The move is the latest in a series of changes to revamp the company to better compete in a changing technology landscape. Big Blue laid off 1,573 more people from its services business in North America this week, bringing the total of jobs cut in that business line to more than 3,000 since the start of the second quarter, IBM said. The cuts represent just a fraction of the company's total workforce of more than 355,000, but underscore the ongoing shifting of resources away from high-cost centers such as the U.S. and Canada toward India and other outsourcing locations, and also a shift within IBM to embrace software and other business lines where profits are more robust. In fact, the layoffs do not mean IBM is shrinking, with the company saying recently that it added some 19,000 employees around the globe during 2006 alone. While speculation is that many of those jobs have been added overseas, IBM does not provide regular updates on the geographic distribution of its workforce. Shares of Big Blue were slightly higher in late morning trading Wednesday to US$106.27. IBM's services unit is its largest generator of revenue, but profit margins have shrunk considerably in recent years, in part because of competition from companies based in India and other lower-cost centers. No additional job cuts are planned in the short term, IBM said, though the company is known to be constantly re-evaluating its employee distribution as part of a larger improvement project aimed at creating a more lean enterprise. IBM is seeking ways to reduce its reliance on labor in the services business by automating processes that can be done without human intervention and shifting work to lower-cost locations when it can be done without hurting customer service Moreover, IBM is changing its business model to rely more on the profits from software, the company told investors last week. This move will make it more profitable in coming years, IBM said. IBM recognizes the opportunities to improve the profitability of its services business by emulating its overseas-based competitors, UBS analyst Ben Reitzes told the . Although IBM is becoming more of a software company and will continue to evolve into a software provider thanks to more than 20 acquisitions it's still integrating, services are still a key part of its overall strategy "Services are a way to sell more software and hardware -- they all go hand in hand," he noted. Still, IBM is wisely wary of taking a loss in any part of its business in order to drive growth in other areas. Even though the U.S. economy appears to be humming along -- and the broad stock market testing new record high levels -- IBM is not alone in cutting workers. In recent months, have each announced thousands of layoffs. In fact, job cuts appear to be accelerating, with the number of layoffs in April up 44 percent compared to the month before, a possible sign that companies are preparing for leaner times ahead. While the home-building sector has been the focus of many job cuts, almost all sectors are seeing reductions, though many appear to be more strategic in nature than purely driven by a need to cut costs, said John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas "Companies that can get ahead of a trend will be better positioned if the economy does take a dip," he told the At IBM, job cuts have been a regular occurrence for some time. During 2005, it cut some 15,000 jobs in the face of lower-than-expected profits, but also said it would add more workers in key areas. It has also added thousands of workers through its software-firm buying spree.

The fax from a marketing group about a Bank of America small business promotion contained images of a lighted match and a bomb with a fuse, bank spokesman Ernesto Anguilla said. But words explaining the promotion did not transmit. "The fax machine malfunctioned, so a partial image came through that looked somewhat suspicious," Anguilla said. The missing text included the phrases "The countdown begins" and "Small business commitment week June 4-8," according to a copy circulated by police. "It was an internal communication designed only for our employees," Anguilla said. The fax was sent to the bank&#039;s branches in parts of New England as well as New York and New Jersey.

A State Police bomb squad searched the bank branch and checked out the package, which was a delivery of documents. About 15 small businesses in a shopping plaza were evacuated for about three hours, including a day care center with about 30 children, Police Chief Scott Rohmer said.

Estimated concentrations of melamine and related compounds: Xtra-Bond in livestock feeds: less than 50 parts per million. AquaBond and AquaTec II in fish and shrimp feed: 230 to 460 ppm. Highest concentrations in recalled pet food: 20,000 ppm. Source: Food and Drug Administration Who was watching suppliers? Chinese exec detained for 2 weeks, report says Flour, in disguise, is the culprit Melamine only part of problem, research says Cats appear more vulnerable FDA limits Chinese food additive imports Asian giant grapples with food-safety probe China admits tainted food link FDA raids wheat gluten importer Melamine may not be accident P&G vows more control of Menu Foods Pet deaths not easy to solve Cross-contamination prompts new recalls Premium dry foods recalled Canadian pet food added to list Dog biscuits become latest product 2 U.S. firms recall feed ingredients By Elizabeth Weise and Julie Schmit, USA TODAY For the first time, the industrial chemical that contaminated pet food ingredients imported from China has been found in livestock and fish feed ingredients produced in the USA. Two companies in Ohio and Colorado recalled the ingredients found to contain melamine, a chemical used in the manufacture of plastics that was linked to the massive pet food recall in March. The contaminated pet food is believed to have killed dogs and cats across the USA. The tainted products have embroiled China in a global controversy over the safety of its food exports. The Food and Drug Administration's Wednesday announcement of the feed recall marks the first discovery of melamine in U.S.-made ingredients. Melamine is not approved for use in feed, pet or human food. The recalls cover the ingredients and fish feed made using the ingredients. Any livestock feed made using the ingredient wasn't recalled because the melamine levels were so low, the FDA said. The FDA said there is also little risk to human health because of the low concentrations. Yet, the discovery is likely to stoke concern about what goes into the food supply. The melamine was found in products used to bind feed pellets together made by Tembec BTLSR of Ohio. The company said it added the melamine to increase the binding property of the ingredient, the FDA said. The Ohio concern is a subsidiary of the Canadian-based forest products giant of the same name. Tembec spokesman John Valley said the company thought it was making a "compliant product" because it wasn't intended for U.S. markets. However, the FDA said, one of the products for livestock feed &#8212; called Xtra-Bond &#8212; was primarily intended for domestic use, while two other recalled products, AquaBond and Aqua-Tec II, were largely intended for export. Neither the FDA nor the companies said how long Tembec had been adding melamine to the ingredients. Tembec has been a supplier to Uniscope since 2004, the companies said. The contamination was discovered by Uniscope of Johnstown, Colo., which makes and distributes binding agents for pelleted cattle, sheep, goat, fish and shrimp feed. That firm discovered the melamine after it tested ingredients that it got from Tembec, and notified the FDA on May 18. It said in a statement that Tembec added the melamine without its knowledge or consent. Tembec discontinued using melamine in April, after the pet food recalls, in response to the public concern and the high cost of melamine, Valley added. Ron Hardy, director of the Aquaculture Research Institute at the University of Idaho, said, "Nobody in the United States would think of using" fish feed that contained those chemicals. In the pet food recall, ingredients had melamine and byproduct concentrations that reached 20% of the product, said David Acheson, the FDA's assistant commissioner for food protection. Concentrations in the animal and fish feed were much lower. The FDA suspects melamine was added to make the pet food ingredients look richer in protein than they were. That does not appear to be the case with the Tembec ingredients, the FDA says. Tembec and Uniscope are cooperating in the investigation, it added.

If completed, the deal will end a period of turmoil at , which has faced a campaign of criticism by large shareholders including William Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management and Ralph Whitworth of Relational Investors. THL and FNF are paying $36 a share in cash for Ceridian â€“ slightly more than the companyâ€™s closing value of $34.19 on Wednesday. The company said the purchase price was 17 per cent higher than its value in mid-February, when it announced the appointment of investment bankers at Greenhill to explore its options. THL and FNF are expected to bring co-investors into the deal, which is becoming a common practice in larger private equity takeovers as it allows buyers to maintain control while diluting risk. Mr Ackmanâ€™s reaction to the deal will be key to its fate. He could not be reached for comment last night. Relational sold its stake in Ceridian earlier this year.

The former media mogul is not expected to be called to the stand by defence lawyers. 2002 Black memo (.pdf) CP Video: Radler testimony, day 2 CP Video: Radler's first day Photos: Camera hits Amiel Black: In his own words Trial exhibits (DOJ site) Photos: Setting the scene A Conrad Black timeline Text of U.S. indictment (.pdf) Graphic: The trial (Flash) Video: Boxes episode, caught on tape Crime sheet: Lawyer's black trial blog Defence expected to take only one or two weeks, so verdict could be returned by the end of June May 31, 2007 04:30 AM CHICAGOâ€“After 43 days of testimony from 27 witnesses, prosecutors rested their case at the criminal trial of Conrad Black. Defence lawyers will take over today and Black's longtime executive assistant Joan Maida is expected to be the first witness. In a somewhat surprising twist after 11 weeks of prosecution witnesses, defence lawyers said yesterday that they would take just a week or two to present their evidence before the jury could begin deliberations. That could mean a verdict returned by the end of June. Black's lawyer Ed Genson said that he would take a little more than a full day to question all of the witnesses appearing on behalf of the besieged press baron. Black is not expected to be called to the stand. Also yesterday, prosecutors agreed to drop a count of money laundering against Black, but wouldn't elaborate on the reasons behind the decision. Gusts of chilly winter winds still blew through the downtown streets of Chicago when prosecutors opened their case against Black and three other Hollinger executives. "It was theft, it was fraud, it was crime," assistant U.S. attorney Jeffrey Cramer said in his opening statement. "Bank robbers wear masks and use a gun." Pointing to the Black and his co-defendants, Cramer remarked, "They dressed in ties and wore a suit." Since then, Cramer and other prosecution lawyers have guided a sometimes riveted, often snoozing, jury through a complicated thicket of details about the newspaper industry and non-compete agreements. Millions of dollars worth of non-compete payments, which prosecutors allege were misappropriated and should have remained with Hollinger International, form the crux of the government's case. In one agreement, Hollinger sold newspapers to a private company called Horizon that was controlled by Black and David Radler, the government's star witness who pleaded guilty and testified against Black. In the Horizon deal, Hollinger paid $1.2 million (U.S.) worth of non-competes to a closely held company that was also controlled by Black. "Black and Radler effectively paid themselves not to compete against themselves," assistant U.S. attorney Eric Sussman said during the trial. In at least one instance, Radler directed that non-compete money be paid to Black, himself and others even when he discovered that non-compete agreements did not exist. Prosecutors also plodded their way through details of Hollinger's juggernaut $3.5 billion (Canadian) sale of most of its Canadian newspapers to CanWest Global Communications Corp. in 2000. In that deal, the prosecution alleges that Black conspired to help co-defendants Peter Atkinson and Jack Boultbee receive non-compete money, even though CanWest had not asked that either sign such a pact. The prosecution also tried to show that Black has used company money to finance a lavish lifestyle for himself and his wife, Barbara Amiel. Prosecutors provided details of a $54,000 (U.S.) birthday party Black held for Amiel in 2000 at La Grenouille, a tony New York restaurant. When the bill for the party arrived, Black wrote to a colleague, "Let's call it one-third personal and two-thirds corporate." Radler, a self-described liar, testified that the dinner was solely a birthday celebration and that no businesses was conducted. Similarly, prosecutors spent several days questioning witnesses about a vacation Black and Amiel took in 2001 to Bora Bora. The cost of the trip was more than $500,000. Again, when the bill arrived, Black balked at paying. "No such outcome is acceptable," he wrote in an email that was introduced as evidence.

Lee Agrees to Buy Ceridian for $5.3 Billion (Update3) By Ian King and Rochelle Garner May 30 (Bloomberg) -- Thomas H. Lee Partners LP and Fidelity National Financial Inc. agreed to buy Ceridian Corp. for $5.3 billion after shareholders pressed the company for changes. Ceridian investors will receive $36 a share, the companies said in a statement. That&#39;s 5.3 percent more than today&#39;s close and 17 percent higher than the price on Feb. 12, the day before the company said it would explore strategic options. The buyers may have been attracted to Ceridian&#39;s Comdata unit, which processes electronic payments and has outperformed the company&#39;s human resources services business. Pershing Square Capital Management LP, Ceridian&#39;s biggest shareholder, had called for a spinoff of the division since January to boost its value. ``Ceridian has leading market positions in large, growing markets,&#39;&#39; Fidelity National Financial Chief Executive Officer William P. Foley said in the statement. The Comdata unit provides private-label credit-cards to national trucking fleets that let drivers charge necessities including gasoline and motel rooms. Comdata also sells so-called ``stored value&#39;&#39; products such as Starbucks Corp. gift cards. Ceridian&#39;s slower-growing human resources unit offers payroll processing, tax filing and benefits administration. Customers including drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc and chip- equipment company Teradyne Inc. use Ceridian to run programs such as employee wellness seminars. Ceridian shares gained 4.1 percent to $35.60 in extended trading after the announcement. They had advanced 47 cents to $34.19 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading and have added 22 percent this year. Pershing, a hedge fund founded by William Ackman, said on Jan. 18 it wanted Ceridian to spin off Comdata because its growth and cash flow have been diluted by other units that haven&#39;t performed as well. Ralph Whitworth&#39;s Relational Investors LLC joined the effort in February. The pressure led the Minneapolis-based company to hire financial and legal advisers to look at ways to boost its value. The company also has been fighting with Pershing over its May 14 firing of Gary Krow, who headed Ceridian&#39;s Comdata division, for disclosing confidential information to Pershing. Pershing said Krow&#39;s firing was part of a pattern by Ceridian of punishing whistleblowers. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating how the company deals with internal ethics complaints as well as its accounting practices. Retailers and transportation companies have been snapping up Comdata&#39;s cards and services amid efforts to focus on electronic payments. Growth in human resources services hasn&#39;t kept up, though the business serves 25 million employees and 110,000 companies in 38 countries, and benefits from long-term orders. On May 1, the company said sales from human resources services would rise at a rate in the ``mid-single digits,&#39;&#39; while Comdata&#39;s growth would be in the ``low to mid-teens&#39;&#39; this year. Since 2002, Ceridian&#39;s sales have grown an average of 7 percent a year and totaled $1.6 billion in 2006. Net income jumped 36 percent last year to $173.6 million. Chief Executive Kathryn Marinello took over the top job in October last year after joining Ceridian from General Electric Co. where she was head of that GE Fleet Services Corp. She owns 162,790 shares Ceridian shares, according to an Oct. 20 filing. Buyout firms globally have engaged in 954 deals this year valued at $432.5 billion, according to Bloomberg data, following last year&#39;s record $701.5 billion. Thomas H. Lee and Fidelity expect to bring co-investors into the transaction, according to the statement. Fidelity will own less than 50 percent of Ceridian, which ended the first quarter with $92.1 million of debt and had $377.3 million in cash and equivalents, according to a May 1 statement. Ceridian plans to hold its annual shareholder meeting by Sept. 21 and said shareholders can vote on the deal then. The purchase is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Founded in 1974, Thomas H. Lee has invested $12 billion in more than 100 businesses. The firm manages now manages about $20 billion, according to the statement. Fidelity National Financial, which provides insurance and claims management services, issues about 29 percent of all title insurance policies in the U.S. Greenhill & Co. and law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised Ceridian. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. advised the buyout firms. Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are providing firm financing commitments to them, and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP is their legal adviser.

Exxon investors put exec pay above climate change By Michael Erman and Ed Stoddard, Reuters spent much of its annual meeting Wednesday defending its environmental policy, but shareholders of the world's largest company were more concerned with executive pay and governance practices. In all, 15 shareholder proposals were up for approval at the annual meeting. Although none received 50% of the shareholder vote, four dealing with pay and governance received at least 40%. All four measures would increase the accountability of Exxon's management and board for their policies and performance. About 47.8% of the shareholders backed a measure that would give holders of 10% of Exxon's outstanding common shares the right to call special shareholder meetings and 47.2% favored a proposal to allow the company to recoup incentive bonuses it determined were unjustified. Proposals to give shareholders an advisory vote on executive pay and to split the chief executive and chairman positions got 41.2% and 40% of the vote, respectively. But climate change was the central topic of discussion at the meeting and one environmental proposal &#8212; that the company adopt goals for greenhouse gas reductions from its products and operations &#8212; received 31% of the shareholder vote. Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson disputed claims by investor activists and environmentalists that the company is working to mislead the public about the causes of climate change. "What I find perplexing is why people feel threatened because we want to have a discussion," Tillerson said when offering an explanation for why the company funds some groups that are skeptical of the mainstream scientific views of climate change. "I'm not going to just adopt a slogan. If that makes me public enemy No. 1, so be it," he said. About three dozen protesters &#8212; outnumbered by police &#8212; staged a peaceful demonstration outside the meeting against the company's funding of groups they believe deny or distort the science of global warming. The protesters waved banners with slogans like "People Before Profits" and chanted "No More Junk Science." "ExxonMobil is double-crossing the public and policymakers. It's avoiding real changes and continuing to fund groups that purposefully distort the science of global warming," said Shawnee Hoover, the campaign director of Exxpose Exxon, a coalition of green and scientific groups. They say the company still funds about 40 organizations that the environmental group classified as "global warming deniers," shelling out more than $2 million to the groups in 2006. Exxon disagrees with the claim that the groups, many of which concern themselves with a wide range of issues, are "deniers of climate change." Scientists believe the use of fossil fuels causes global warming. Copyright 2007 Reuters Limited.

FIM, a division of News Corp, has ended the recent stand-off between MySpace and the US's most popular photo site by revealing they are set to join forces. The double acquisition had been expected for some time and was media earlier this month The deal will strengthen the FIM network's photo and video sharing capabilities and reaffirm MySpace's status as the number one social networking site. The Photobucket deal is expected to be the most lucrative, as it is already the 34th most visited website in the United States, with over 42 million users and 17 million monthly visitors. However, it hasn't exactly been plain sailing between FIM and Photobucket, after MySpace blocked Photobucket's embedded video and slide show widgets last month following a violation related to a Spider-Man 3 promotional campaign. The deal is thought to be worth around $250 million for Photobucket, while the relatively new site Flektor is rumoured to have sold for around $20 million. Photobucket co-founder Alex Welch told the Denver Post: "As we continued to build our services and our roadmap, it made sense to sit down and look at strategic options. "When we looked at everything we were looking to accomplish ... it made sense to team up with Fox Interactive."

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/31food.html&cid Melamine From U.S. Put in Feed - New York Times Melamine From U.S. Put in Feed Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 31, 2007 Ever since pet food contaminated with an industrial chemical was traced to shipments of wheat flour from China, American officials have concentrated on cracking down on imports. It turns out the problem was closer to home, too. Yesterday, federal officials announced that a manufacturing plant in was using the same banned substance, melamine, to make binding agents that ended up in feed for farmed fish, shrimp and livestock. The problem surfaced after a distributor, concerned about what was in its feed binders after the reports from China, sent the product to a private laboratory for testing. The melamine was used by BTLSR, a Canadian forest products company with a small chemical plant in Toledo, to make binding agents that keep pellets of animal feed together, said Dr. David Acheson, assistant commissioner for food protection at the Food and Drug Administration Melamine is not permitted in food or pet food products. In the last few months, pet food contaminated with melamine, all traced back to China, sickened or killed thousands of pets in the United States. Dr. Acheson said the levels of melamine and melamine-related compounds in Tembec&#8217;s products were far lower than that found in wheat flour from China that ended up killing the pets. Consequently, the authorities said that they thought the contamination did not appear to pose a risk to human health. Nevertheless, the F.D.A. issued a voluntary recall of finished feed made with two binding agents: Aquabond and Aqua-Tec II, which are made by Tembec and used in fish and shrimp feed. A third product, Xtra-Bond, which is made by a Colorado firm called Uniscope using Tembec ingredients, was not recalled because the levels of melamine were low. Uniscope is the distributor of all three products. Aquabond and Aqua-Tec II are sold mostly overseas; Xtra-Bond is sold domestically. Agency officials are alerting the foreign governments that received the products, Dr. Acheson said. The investigation began on May 18 when Uniscope alerted the agency that it had discovered melamine in the testing. Dr. Acheson said that the investigation was in its early stages and that some questions remained unanswered, like how long Tembec had used melamine in its products and the extent of the contamination. &#8220;What Tembec knew, didn&#8217;t know, what their activities were, is part of the investigation,&#8221; Dr. Acheson said, at a news conference. Earlier, he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to believe that a manufacturer of pet food would not know about this.&#8221; Federal officials would not say whether they would pursue criminal charges in the Tembec case. They said that they had already been contacting domestic manufacturers to make sure they were aware of the sources of their ingredients. John Valley, Tembec&#8217;s executive vice president for business development and corporate affairs, said his company thought that Uniscope was shipping the binders overseas for use as shrimp feed. Once the F.D.A. told it that the binders were being used domestically, Tembec stopped making them from melamine, Mr. Valley said. Tembec makes resins and certain chemicals for industrial uses, including melamine. Mr. Valley said Uniscope was the only customer that used its products for animal feed. Asked why it was all right to use melamine in feed for shrimp overseas but not in the United States, he said: &#8220;Melamine has just really had a focus that&#8217;s come upon it. A lot of companies and agencies are reviewing certain applications of melamine.&#8221; The pet food scandal has led to increased scrutiny of all food imports, particularly those from China, and threatened trade relations. Some members of Congress have demanded tougher inspections of food imports from China. &#8220;This recent incident goes to show that we apparently have some bad actors out there,&#8221; said Michael Doyle, director of the Center for Food Safety at the . &#8220;It can happen in the United States.&#8221; But Mr. Doyle pointed out that the incidence of food illness remains relatively rare in the United States. The problem with the Tembec binders surfaced after Uniscope, a company based in Johnstown, Colo., decided to test the binders. &#8220;They just asked themselves, &#8216;I wonder what&#8217;s in this stuff? I wonder if we have anything in here that shouldn&#8217;t be in here?&#8217; &#8221; said Charlie Russell, a company spokesman. &#8220;So they sent some samples to a lab.&#8221; Tembec has been a supplier to Uniscope since January 2004, Mr. Russell said. Employees at Uniscope, which was founded in 1975 and is family owned, thought that they were buying a resin that was fit for animal consumption, Mr. Russell said. Uniscope sells the binders to feed manufacturers that mix them with grain and other ingredients to make food pellets for livestock and fish, he said. The binders are sold both domestically and abroad, Mr. Russell said. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tembec acquired BTLSR Toledo, a custom manufacturer of spray-dry resins, for $8.5 million in 2003.

Federal prosecutors did not definitively resolve the probe of Ernst, one of the nation's four biggest audit firms, leaving open the prospect that the firm could be subject to possible financial penalties and other punishment. But high-ranking officials, including three lawyers, face more than a decade in prison if they are convicted. Ever had a losing investment? Learn anything from it?

Send your tale along with your name and phone number to: From The Post's Print Edition All of Today's Business Articles Today's Business Front Image Markets News and Research Save & Share Article Authorities singled out Robert Coplan, former director of Ernst's Center for Wealth Planning and a onetime official at the ; Martin Nissenbaum, who leads Ernst's personal income tax and retirement planning practice; Richard Shapiro, a tax partner; and Brian Vaughn, a former tax partner. Each of the men worked in an Ernst unit known as VIPER, an acronym for Value Ideas Produce Extraordinary Results. From 1998 to 2004, they helped wealthy individuals slash or eliminate taxes they owed by creating off-the-shelf tax products that brought Ernst millions of dollars, government lawyers said. Three of the men used a tax shelter in 2000 to evade their own taxes, according to Michael J. Garcia, the attorney in the Southern District of . In all, that shelter helped them and eight other Ernst executives skirt nearly $4 million in tax liabilities. Garcia said that activity by the Ernst executives "far exceeds the bounds of legitimate tax planning and reflects flagrant disregard of the law." Ernst &amp; Young, which paid $15 million to settle related allegations with the IRS in 2003, said it had long ago disbanded the unit involved in the shelter work. Two of the partners charged yesterday had been on paid administrative leave under the terms of the firm's partnership agreement since August 2006, according to Ernst spokesman Charles Perkins. Two others had already departed the firm. "Ernst & Young has cooperated with the government from the beginning of its investigation," the firm said in a statement. "We have voluntarily made many changes and enhancements to our tax practice." Each of the men pleaded not guilty in proceedings before a federal judge in New York yesterday afternoon. Lawyers for the executives said they were disappointed by the government's decision to proceed with the case. Ernst generated nearly $125 million in fees through the sale of four tax strategies mentioned in the indictment, prosecutors said. The executives allegedly worried about putting some of the deal terms in writing and leaving presentations in the hands of clients, according to memos and e-mail messages cited in the indictment. They allegedly worked in tandem with willing law firms that blessed the tax strategies in exchange for fees of $50,000 to $100,000 apiece. The deals were designed to look like money-losing investments that would create phony losses for people facing taxable income of $10 million or $20 million, according to the indictment. Coplan and Vaughn are also charged with misleading IRS investigators as part of a 2002 audit the agency conducted into Ernst's sale of tax shelters. Criminal charges against Ernst itself appear unlikely given recent decisions by federal prosecutors in New York, who expressed concern that an indictment could drive key accounting and law firms out of business. But the firm could face other sanctions. For instance, the government reached a $456 million settlement with accounting firm in 2005, but it has also filed criminal charges against 16 former officials there in a case that has yet to go to trial. Last week, Garcia announced he would not seek an indictment of law firm Sidley Austin for its role in approving abusive tax shelters for clients.

Motorola, which had already planned to complete 3,500 job reductions by June 30, on Wednesday forecast restructuring charges of about $300 million, or about 8 cents per share, over the rest of 2007 as a result of the latest lay-offs. A hostess holds a Motorola Z8 mobile phone at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona, February 15, 2007. Motorola Inc. reported a quarterly loss on Wednesday and gave a forecast that raised doubts over when the world's second-biggest mobile phone maker could turn around its business and return to profit. REUTERS/Albert Gea Email to a friend The company, which has been losing market share to rivals such as market leader Nokia due to a lack of advanced phones and tough price competition, had said in April that it would announce additional cost-cutting plans by June. The latest planned cuts at the company, which had 66,000 employees at the end of 2006, will be made by the end of the year, according to Motorola, which did not provide specifics on the break-down of the lay-offs. But while the job cuts will help with costs, Oppenheimer analyst Lawrence Harris said Motorola, which has been criticized for failing produce a hit to follow its popular Razr phone, would need better phone models to impress investors. "It will certainly help them return to profitability but it's not enough to get them to the double digit profit margins they seek," he said, adding: "They need exciting new products." Motorola's stock rose to $18.46 in after-hours trade following the news, up 1 percent from its close of $18.28 on the New York Stock Exchange. Schaumburg, Illinois-based Motorola forecast $600 million in annual cost savings in 2008 as a result of the latest job cuts, other spending controls and site rationalization. It said it was on target to save $400 million from the 3,500 lay-offs announced in January. The company also said there would be no adverse effect on customer service or product quality as a result of the cuts. "It's happening in all businesses functions and regions," company spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said of the cuts. "A lot is through normal attrition and some is through involuntary separation." She said Motorola would continue to hire in critical areas across the company. The company, which also makes network equipment and television set-top boxes, has said in recent months it was shifting the priorities of its phone business to improving profitability from gaining market share at all costs. In a separate statement, Motorola, which recently ended a bitter proxy battle with billionaire investor Carl Icahn, said on Wednesday that Icahn had won more than 43 percent of the votes for a seat on the board at its annual meeting in May. Motorola's preferred candidate, John White, was voted in over Icahn, the activist investor who had taken a stake of roughly 3 percent in the company in an effort to get onto its board.

But Warren County Sheriff Larry Cleveland seems to have a problem with upholding the laws of the state of New York uniformly.Â  He likes to pick and choose which ones heâ€™s going to enforce, sometimes depending on whoâ€™s involved.

Testimony by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) presented at the hearing concludes that many nursing homes shown to be providing substandard care are still not being subjected to tough sanctions, and may therefore not be motivated to make the lasting improvements necessary to protect the health and safety of residents.

Edwards for $6.8 Billion (Update5) May 31 (Bloomberg) -- Wachovia Corp. agreed to buy A.G. Edwards Inc., the 120-year-old securities firm, for $6.8 billion, doubling its sales staff as regional brokers struggle to remain independent amid declining revenue from trading stocks. The biggest purchase of a U.S. brokerage firm in almost seven years will pay A.G. Edwards holders $89.50 a share in cash and stock, or 16 percent more than yesterday&#39;s closing price, Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia said in a statement today. The takeover will create the second-largest U.S. brokerage firm after Merrill Lynch & Co., with almost 14,800 financial advisers. St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards, founded by a friend of former President Abraham Lincoln, has fallen behind in the competition for stock trades as investors turn to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS AG, Merrill and Morgan Stanley, which offer better prices. ``A.G. Edwards was a special firm, Midwest-oriented, fiercely proud of that, but we are in a different era,&#39;&#39; said Bruce Foerster, president of Miami-based South Beach Capital Markets. A.G. Edwards employs 6,618 financial advisers in 742 U.S. offices and two European locations. Wachovia Securities currently has 8,166 brokers and $773 billion of client assets. ``We knew we needed scale, we knew we needed additional products as financial services continue to migrate toward a global platform,&#39;&#39; A.G. Edwards Chief Executive Officer Robert Bagby said on a conference call. ``We could not provide that at A.G. Edwards. We didn&#39;t have the capital base.&#39;&#39; A.G. Edwards shares rose $10.47, or 14 percent, to $87.62 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at 11:40 a.m. The stock advanced 22 percent this year through yesterday, making it the second-best performer on the 12-member Amex Securities Broker/Dealer Index after TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. Shares of Wachovia fell 36 cents to $54.19. Shares of Raymond James Financial Inc. and other regional brokerages surged on speculation they may be taken over as well. Raymond James, based in St. Petersburg, Florida, gained 8 percent to $33.54. Stifel Financial Corp., A.G. Edwards&#39;s crosstown rival in St. Louis, climbed 7.8 percent, to $60.11. Wachovia CEO Kennedy Thompson expanded the company&#39;s reach into western states in October with the bank&#39;s largest takeover, a $24.2 billion acquisition of Golden West Financial Corp. That deal doubled the size of Wachovia&#39;s interest-rate sensitive mortgage portfolio. The A.G. Edwards purchase will help him boost revenue from more predictable fee income, and sell more retail bank products and investment-banking services to A.G. Edwards&#39;s brokerage clients. Fees will now account for about 50 percent of the bank&#39;s annual revenue, up from 45 percent, ``providing insulation&#39;&#39; from a narrowing in the gap between short- and long-term interest rates that has driven up Wachovia&#39;s costs to hold deposits, Goldman Sachs analyst Lori Appelbaum wrote in a note today to clients. The acquisition will be the fifth largest in Wachovia&#39;s history and the biggest for a U.S. brokerage since Zurich-based UBS bought New York-based Paine Webber Group Inc. in November 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wachovia is paying about 3.2 times the book value of A.G. Edwards, less than the 3.6 times that UBS paid for PaineWebber in 2000, Banc of America Securities analyst Michael Hecht wrote in a research note today. ``We&#39;re pleased,&#39;&#39; said Charles Bobrinskoy, vice chairman of Ariel Capital Management, A.G. Edwards&#39; third-biggest investor with about 2.9 million shares. ``The price is not overwhelming. It&#39;s good news, but it&#39;s not a great price.&#39;&#39; Traditionally a bank serving the U.S. Southeast, Wachovia expanded in the securities industry by merging with First Union Corp. in 2001 and acquiring Prudential Financial Inc.&#39;s brokerage unit in 2003. Wachovia Securities will shift its headquarters to St. Louis from Richmond, Virginia. Daniel Ludeman, 50, will continue to serve as president and CEO of Wachovia Securities, while Bagby, 63, will be chairman. The acquisition will add to earnings per share within the first year, excluding about $860 million in related expenses, Wachovia said. Annual cost savings will total $395 million annually after tax by 2009. Some of those savings will come from reducing by a quarter the companies&#39; combined 15,000 to 16,000 workers who aren&#39;t licensed Series 7 brokers, David Carroll, head of Wachovia&#39;s capital-management unit said in an interview. Wachovia will also close about 230 brokerage offices over a three-year period. The two companies plan to complete the transaction in the fourth quarter. ``Our take is that this is an attractive deal for Wachovia,&#39;&#39; Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP in London, said in a note to clients. ``Though management have not quantified any revenue synergies, we see meaningful upside from several sources.&#39;&#39; Thompson said on the conference call that the bank will look to sell retail banking products and investment-banking services to A.G. Edwards&#39;s clients. ``This is truly a rare opportunity,&#39;&#39; said Thompson, who downplayed talk of more mergers after Wachovia&#39;s Golden West acquisition. The purchase ``will make us better able to withstand the ups and downs in equity markets.&#39;&#39; The acquisition, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, will exchange 0.9844 share of Wachovia stock and $35.80 in cash for each share of A.G. Edwards. Wachovia is entitled to a $270 million termination fee if the deal doesn&#39;t go through, it said in a regulatory filing. Wachovia&#39;s Carroll said in the interview he wouldn&#39;t ``speculate on someone lobbing in a higher offer&#39;&#39; for A.G. Edwards. ``We have the normal deal protections in here,&#39;&#39; he said. ``But economics is not the only driver of this deal.&#39;&#39; Prudential Financial, which currently owns 38 percent of Wachovia Securities, said it supports the deal. The company has a range of options regarding its Wachovia stake, Carroll said on the call, including adding more capital or ``putting&#39;&#39; its stake back to Wachovia. Credit Suisse and Wachovia Securities served as financial advisers to Wachovia on the transaction, while Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LP gave legal advice. Goldman Sachs and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised A.G. Edwards.

The public was told it was only wet and pouched food, that absolutely no dry pet food was involved. That was wrong.Â  Not only was dry pet food involved but so were dog biscuits and pet treats. Then it was pork, then chickens, then farm-fed fish.Â  But both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture tried to tell the public that there was minimal to no risk to the human food supply.Â  For the past two and half months since the recalls first began in mid-March with the nearly 100 brands of dog and cat recalled, the federal government has been busy downplaying the risk as more and more reports of contamination of the food supply for humans, pets, livestock and fish. Thousands of pets were killed and thousands more sickened and incapacitated from kidney failure.Â  Inanely, the contaminated pet food removed from the shelves was used to feed hogs, resulting in tainted pork. Now the FDA is alerting livestock and fish/shrimp feed manufacturers about a voluntary recall of products used in feed production because several have been found to contain melamine and related compounds. The FDA announced Wednesday that a source within the United States has been identified as producing a melamine-contaminated ingredient used in domestic livestock feed as well as in domestic and exported fish feed. This contamination is not considered to be related to the nationwide pet food recall that began March 16, according to the FDA. The feed ingredients were made by Tembec BTLSR Inc. of Toledo, Ohio and Uniscope, Inc. of Johnstown, Colo. Tembec, a contract manufacturer for Uniscope, makes AquaBond and Aqua-Tec II, which it distributes for Uniscope. Uniscope makes Xtra-Bond using ingredients supplied by Tembec. All of the products are binding agents that are used to make pelleted feed for cattle, sheep, and goats, or fish and shrimp. The companies have confirmed that Tembec added melamine as part of the formulation of the products to improve the binding properties of pelleted feed. Melamine is not approved as an additive for animal or fish/shrimp feed. The companies have stopped adding melamine to the feed products. Based on the levels of melamine and related compounds in the initial ingredients, FDA estimated the probable level of melamine and related compounds in livestock feed as less than 50 parts per million (ppm) based on the recommended mix rate of two to four pounds of binding agent per ton of livestock feed. The estimated levels in fish and shrimp feed are less than 233 ppm and 465 ppm, respectively, of melamine and related compounds. The estimated levels of melamine and related compounds vary in the livestock feed and the fish and shrimp feed because of differing levels of melamine in the binding agents used for each type of feed. FDA advises feed manufacturers and others who mix their own feed not to use these products, and to contact the manufacturers. FDA advises feed manufacturers to recall finished feed that is made from AquaBond or Aqua-Tec II due to the estimated levels of melamine and related compounds in the finished products. FDA believes that no recall is warranted of the finished feed made from Xtra-Bond based on the estimated levels of melamine and related compounds in the finished product and based on currently available data and information. The estimated melamine levels in feed made with these binding agents are similar to the levels discussed in the interim safety/risk assessment of melamine and related compounds made available by FDA earlier this month, says the FDA. Â In that assessment, federal â€œscientistsâ€ determined that, based on currently available data and information, the consumption of pork, chicken, domestic fish, and eggs from animals inadvertently fed animal feed contaminated with melamine and its analogues was unlikely to pose a human health risk, according to the FDA. FDA is encouraging domestic feed suppliers to be vigilant in quality control in their supply chain and to monitor for any improper additives, including melamine and its analogs. The Tembec and Uniscope products also reportedly contain a urea formaldehyde resin-type ingredient, a raw ingredient used to make the binding agent in these products. FDA is investigating this use of the urea formaldehyde resin-type ingredient in the Tembec and Uniscope products, and will take appropriate regulatory action if warranted. Earlier this month, Cereal Byproducts Company of Mt. Prospect announced that the FDA had determined that there are melamine and/or melamine derivatives in the rice protein concentrate produced by a single source Chinese supplier, Binzhou Futian Biology Technology Co. Lt. and purchased through a â€œlocalâ€ domestic importer.Â  FDA later said that it was wheat flour, not rice protein or wheat gluten which was the contaminated ingredient. The Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Co. Ltd., has also been identified as having exported the contaminated wheat flour containing melamine to the U.S. The managers of both of the Chinese companies which have been linked to the contaminated pet food which has killed and sickened thousands of cats and dogs in the U.S. and Canada, have been arrested. The head of Chinaâ€™s drug administration was sentenced to death Tuesday for accepting bribes to approve adulterated medicines including antibiotics which resulted in the deaths of six individuals and sickened scores more. The conviction and death sentenceÂ  for Zheng Ziaoyu, 63, former chief of the state Food and Drug Administration of China followed the international scandal about the tainted exports from the Chinese firms related to the pet food contamination and toothpaste with a potentially poisonous chemical addictive which was sold in Latin America. The Chinese companies had issued a statement that said that they had added melamine to the wheat gluten and rice protein in order to meet the contractual demand for protein levels.Â  Melamine is not approved as a food additive.Â  The companies said they only broke the law when they intentionally mislabeled the exported items to avoid inspection. Melamine is a molecule that has a number of commercial and industrial uses.Â  Other than a few limited authorizations for use in food contact materials for human food, melamine has no approved use as an ingredient in human or animal food in the U.S.Â  According to the Chinese government, Xuzhou Anying did not declare the contaminated wheat gluten (wheat flour) it shipped to the U.S. as a raw material for feed or food.Â  Rather, according to the Chinese government, it was declared to them as a non-food product, meaning that it was not subject to mandatory inspection by the Chinese government. Cereal Byproducts said it shipped the recalled product to a total of three customers located in the Midwest between July 19, 2006 and March 14, 2007. The FDA previously found melamine and/or melamine derivatives in Wilbur-Ellis Companyâ€™s rice protein concentrate, which was purchased from the same Chinese supplier as Cereal Byproducts. Cereal Byproducts proactively notified their customers of this finding, and thereafter both parties implemented their own voluntary recall of the contaminated products on or about April 19. Although Cereal Byproducts says it had received no confirmed cases of pet deaths, company officials said the voluntarily chose to initiate the recall when Cereal Byproducts discovered there was a potential contamination of melamine or melamine type derivatives. Cereal Byproducts had supplied rice protein concentrate to Royan Canin USA which on Friday announced its second recall, this time calling back right Sensible Choice dry food products and seven Kasco dry dog and cat food products. Â Royal Canin said it had found trace amounts of melamine in its products. FDA continues to assert that t he risk to human health is very low from eating meat from hogs and chickens that have been fed animal feed supplemented with pet food scraps containing melamine and related compounds, according to a risk assessment conducted by federal scientists. They say this conclusion supports the decision announced on April 28, not to recall meat from animals that were fed contaminated product. The FDA claimed that the pet food scraps fed to hogs and chickens made up only a small percentage of the farm animal rations. In addition, melamine is known to be excreted in animal urine, and believed not to accumulate in the body of animals. When exposure levels are much higher, as was the case with cats and dogs, the melamine and its compounds appear to cause the formation of crystals in the kidney systems, resulting in kidney damage. There was no indication of kidney damage in hogs. Both hogs and chickens known to have been fed contaminated feed appear to be healthy.

The US government withdrew one of the 14 charges without explanation, as it wrapped up 11 weeks of evidence against the fallen media baron and three of his associates. Lord Black's lawyers have indicated that they will call only a few witnesses and could take barely a week to set out their defence, suggesting that they do not plan to risk putting the famously pompous peer on the stand. That in turn suggests they are confident that the prosecution has failed to build the cast-iron case that would require such a desperate last roll of the dice. Observers said that the prosecution has failed to present evidence that would allow the technical charge of money laundering to stick. Lord Black still faces 13 counts of fraud, racketeering and obstruction of justice, which could put him in jail for the rest of his life. The prosecution yesterday called their final witnesses after painting Lord Black as a fraudster who treated his US-quoted newspaper company, Hollinger International, as a personal piggy bank, to the detriment of outside shareholders. As well as living high on on company expenses, the peer cooked up a string of bogus "non-compete" agreements that allowed him and his associates to pocket $60m in illegal payments, the prosecution claimed. Hollinger's independent board members &shy; including the former governor of Illinois, Jim Thompson and the Canadian economist Marie-Josee Kravis &shy; testified that they did not know that such large sums were being diverted to Lord Black and the three other defendants, Jack Boultbee, Mark Kipnis and Peter Atkinson. And David Radler, Lord Black's right-hand man for more than three decades, said that he and Lord Black had dreamed up the idea of using non-compete payments as a way of sheltering bonuses from tax and to pay off debts at their other companies. Testifying as part of a plea deal that gives him a lenient 29-month term in a Canadian jail, Mr Radler was attacked by defence attorneys as a liar out to save his own skin. While Mr Radler repeatedly insisted that he had initially denied wrongdoing in order to protect Lord Black, Edward Greenspan, Lord Black's lawyer, forced him to admit that he had double-crossed Lord Black in other business dealings. Steven Skurka, a veteran defence attorney who has been observing the trial as a commentator for Canadian television, repeated his assertion that Lord Black will be acquitted, citing the defence team's performance in cross-examining the main witnesses, in particular their success in getting Mr Thompson to admit that he had only "skimmed" important documents. "Conrad Black is the uncontrollable waterfall. The prosecution's job is to do enough to force him to testify. I don't think that they have done enough, and as I result I think they will ultimately lose the case," Mr Skurka said. However, that is by no means a universal view among representatives of the dozens of media organisations from the US, the UK and Canada that have descended on Chicago to cover the trial. Others believe that the prosecution's vivid evidence of Lord Black's lavish personal spending on expenses will prove more persuasive to the blue-collar, mainly female jury than the non-compete deal paperwork. Eddie Genson, Lord Black's Chicago-based attorney, has repeatedly asked the judge to declare a mistrial because of what he says is the prosecution's pandering to "class prejudice". The peer has vowed to sue all his accusers "when" he is acquitted. He has loudly defended himself outside the court, in a round of media interviews to publicise his new biography of Richard Nixon, during which he has insisted that the prosecution case against him is a tissue of lies. The judge, Amy St Eve, was so incensed at Lord Black's public statements that she told the defence team to "restrain" him, or she would do it for them. Lord Black and his associates cooked up a scheme to pay themselves $5.5m by promising not to set up a newspaper in the tiny mountain town of Mammoth in California - a promise they had no difficulty in keeping, since they already owned the only paper there. Prosecutors brandished a copy of the Mammoth Times to illustrate that the non-compete clauses signed by Lord Black were sham agreements meant only to disguise massive bonus payments. Jurors were shown the sumptuous menu for the surprise 60th birthday party thrown by Lord Black for his wife at the lavish New York restaurant La Grenouille in December 2000. The $62,870 bill, it was revealed, included a $14,847 drinks tab. Beluga caviar was among the starters. Hollinger picked up two-thirds of the tab. The Park Avenue apartment Lord Black ordered a $2.1m refurbishment for his New York apartment, spending $5,300 on heated towel rails, $6,000 on shower doors and $7,000 on window sashes - and then made up for the expense by buying the apartment from Hollinger at $3m below the market price. Hollinger also paid for a servants' quarters. Hollinger's company jet was routinely used by Lord Black and his wife for personal trips. Prosecutors have charged him with defrauding outside shareholders by paying only half the $565,326 cost of a round-trip flight to the South Pacific idyll of Bora Bora. The jury was shown grainy CCTV footage of Lord Black, his personal assistant and chauffeur loading 13 boxes of documents into his limousine on the same day that prosecutors say he was told to hand over documents to US regulators.

Lawyers for Lord Black, who still faces more than a dozen charges relating to racketeering, obstruction of justice, mail, wire and tax fraud, said they would take just over two days to rebut 11 weeks of prosecution evidence. The apparent brevity of the defence case indicates that Lord Black himself will probably not be called to testify. This suggests that Lord Black's defence team is either confident that the prosecution's case is not strong enough, or, that it may be too risky to subject the former Telegraph owner to cross-examination over the $60m case. Lord Black's lawyers intend to put their case early next week. The prosecution's case ended with lawyers showing bank statements indicating Lord Black had spent millions on diamonds and jewellery for his wife. Earlier this week, the prosecution case levelled a number of other accusations against Lord Black. Lawyers argued obstruction of justice relating to CCTV footage of 13 boxes Lord Black allegedly removed from the company's headquarters in defiance of a court order. Further accusations centred on a Park Avenue flat bought by Hollinger International for Lord Black in 1994, which the prosecution argued was worth millions more than the amount he subsequently paid to buy it six years later. Lord Black said he spent several million dollars renovating the apartment. Lord Black and three other former executives of Hollinger International are charged with swindling the newspaper holding company out of millions of dollars through the sale of Hollinger assets. The alleged scheme began with a decision in the late-90s by Lord Black, who was the company's chairman, to sell hundreds of small Hollinger-owned community newspapers across the US and Canada. Millions of dollars were paid to Hollinger in exchange for promises that it would not go into competition with the new owners of the papers. Prosecutors have claimed Lord Black and two of his co-defendants, former Hollinger vice-presidents John Boultbee and Peter Y Atkinson, illegally diverted much of the money to themselves with help from corporate counsel Mark Kipnis. Mr Kipnis also is on trial. All four of the defendants maintain that they did nothing illegal. To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email or phone 020 7239 9857.

Miller Published May 31, 2007, 8:02 AM CDT Sears Holdings Corp.'s fiscal first-quarter net income showed a solid increase -- thanks to a number of one-time gains -- but the retail giant's underlying profits were flat, the company said today. "In part, our domestic operating results reflect the impact of some of the same challenges being faced by our customers, such as rising energy costs and a slowing housing market," said President and Chief Executive Officer Aylwin Lewis. For the quarter ended May 5, net income at the Hoffman Estates company was $216 million, or $1.40 a diluted share, up from the year-ago period's $180 million, or $1.14 a share. Sears' revenues slipped slightly to $11.70 billion from $12.0 billion. But excluding the impact of onetime special items, Sears pointed out, per-share earnings dipped to $1.10 from $1.11 a year ago. In the latest quarter, the company enjoyed a 12-cent-a-share gain from a legal settlement; an 11-cent-a-share gain from curtailment of certain post-retirement benefits for workers at its Sears Canada affiliate; and an aggregate 14-cent gain related to a dividend from Sears Mexico and hurricane-related recoveries. Partially offsetting those gains was an 8-cent-a-share loss on certain financial "swap" investments that Sears chairman and controlling stockholder Eddie Lampert routinely makes using the company's cash flow. Those investments have often yielded big gains for Sears, but in the latest quarter they served as a drag on profits. On an operating basis, Sears noted that profits declined at its Kmart unit, with sales weakening "most notably" in home goods, health and beauty products, and food. At the company's Sears outlets, sales at stores open at least twelve months showed a decline -- in part because of weaker home appliance sales, which the company said "reflects both a slower U.S. housing market and the impact of increased competition."

Yahoo said its co-founder, Jerry Yang, would assume Mr. Nazem’s responsibilities while it searches for a replacement. The departure of Mr. Nazem, 45, who is known as Zod, will follow a turbulent year at Yahoo that included a companywide revamping. Several other senior executives, including the chief operating officer, have left in the wake of the overhaul. Yahoo would not make Mr. Nazem or any other executive available to discuss his departure. But a spokeswoman, Joanna Stevens, said that Mr. Nazem had wanted to retire and that he and the chief executive, Terry S. Semel, had been planning his departure for some time. Writing in the company’s , Mr. Nazem said, “As I began contemplating retirement, there were a few milestones that I (along with the executive leadership team) wanted to accomplish prior to my departure.” Those milestones, he wrote, included the reorganization of the company and its technology group, as well as the introduction of an advertising platform, known as Project Panama, which Yahoo began introducing in February. “It was very important to me,” Mr. Nazem said, “to drive all the way to my last day here at Yahoo without distractions of an announcement like this.” The new advertising platform is aimed at narrowing the lead of in online advertising, but it has yet to translate into financial gains for the company. Mr. Nazem, who is responsible for the operation of the Yahoo Web site and for product development, was popular among the company’s technology ranks, whom he largely helped hire. This month, Yahoo appointed Blake Jorgensen, a founder of Thomas Weisel Partners, as chief financial officer, replacing Susan L. Decker, who is switching roles to become head of the company’s advertiser and publisher group. Yahoo is looking for an executive to lead its audience group, which is responsible for much of the main company Web site. After Mr. Nazem’s departure, Yahoo is likely to have vacant positions at the top of two of its three operating units. As part of his separation agreement, Mr. Nazem will receive a lump sum equal to his base salary for the rest of the year as well as accelerated vesting of stock options and stock awards, a package that an executive compensation firm, Equilar, estimated around $6.9 million.

FIM, a division of News Corp, has ended the recent stand-off between MySpace and the US's most popular photo site by revealing they are set to join forces. The double acquisition had been expected for some time and was media earlier this month The deal will strengthen the FIM network's photo and video sharing capabilities and reaffirm MySpace's status as the number one social networking site. The Photobucket deal is expected to be the most lucrative, as it is already the 34th most visited website in the United States, with over 42 million users and 17 million monthly visitors. However, it hasn't exactly been plain sailing between FIM and Photobucket, after MySpace blocked Photobucket's embedded video and slide show widgets last month following a violation related to a Spider-Man 3 promotional campaign. The deal is thought to be worth around $250 million for Photobucket, while the relatively new site Flektor is rumoured to have sold for around $20 million. Photobucket co-founder Alex Welch told the Denver Post: "As we continued to build our services and our roadmap, it made sense to sit down and look at strategic options.

Click me to Chemical that led to pet food recall used by US company for animal feed A Chinese man looks at samples of grains including wheat and rice from a northern Chinese agricultural company that is on display at a food fair in Shanghai, 10 May 2007. China acknowledged for the first time, that it was the source of deadly additives found in US pet foods and that two companies illegally added melamine to the wheat gluten and rice protein. Photograph by : AFP/Getty Images Published: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 WASHINGTON â€” The same industrial chemical that led to a massive pet food recall was used by a U.S. manufacturer of ingredients for feeding livestock, fish and shrimp, health officials said Wednesday. The announcement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was the first indication that an American company had used melamine as an animal feed ingredient. Previously, the problem was thought to be contained to China, where manufacturers had added melamine to wheat flour, which was then added to animal feed. Melamine is not approved as an additive for the feed. It has a number of industrial uses, including as a binding agent and flame retardant. Itâ€™s also used as fertilizer in some parts of the world, but not in the U.S. U.S. officials said the use of melamine in animal feed posed no threat to human health. They said that melamine and related compounds were used to bind feed pellets for cattle, sheep and goats, or fish and shrimp. In China, they said, the chemical was probably added to show greater levels of protein. The FDA alerted feed manufacturers that ingredients containing melamine and related compounds were found in products made by Tembec BTLSR Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, and used by Uniscope Inc. of Johnstown, Colo. Tembec, a subsidiary of the Montreal-based forestry giant,Â  makes two products, AquaBond and Aqua-Tec II, which it distributes for Uniscope. The products are used in fish feed. Uniscope also makes a product for livestock feed called Xtra-Bond, and it uses ingredients produced by Tembec. The FDA advised feed manufacturers and others not to use the products and to contact the two manufacturers. Officials said they had no idea how much feed contains the tainted ingredients. Calls to Tembec for comment were not immediately returned. Canadian killed in Afghanistan A Canadian soldier died Wednesday night when the American helicopter he was aboard...

This drug has been found to prolong the survival of advanced renal carcinoma patients by about 3 Â½ months, according to a study led by Gary R. Hudes, M.D., director of the Genitourinary Malignancies Program at Fox Chase Cancer Center. The study has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine. A total of 626 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were enrolled in the study and were subjected to one of the following three treatments â€“ the new drug Torisel, an older drug called interferon, or both the drugs together. The patients who received Torisel alone survived longer than those who received interferon, the usual or â€˜standardâ€™ treatment for this disease. According to this study, the greatest increase in median survival was observed in patients receiving Torisel (49 percent) compared with patients treated with interferon only. Patients treated with Torisel and interferon combined had a 15 percent increase in median survival compared with interferon alone. The median survival for Torisel alone was 10.9 months compared with and 8.4 months for the Torisel and interferon, and 7.3 months for the interferon. "This is the first study to show that a new drug can improve overall survival for patients with metastatic renal cell cancer," said Hudes. Renal Cell Carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer, accounting for about 90% of all adult kidney cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S. Many patients with kidney cancer opt for a surgery to remove the tumor. However, about 35% of them experience either a recurrence of the tumor or its spread to other organs. â€œFor these patients, the goal of treatment is to prevent further spread and growth of the cancer, and ideally, to reduce that amount of cancer," Hudes said. "Until recently, physicians lacked effective drugs to control the disease." The drug Torisel is basically an enzyme inhibitor, a protein that regulates cell production, growth and survival. Temsirolimus blocks the function of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key protein within cells regulating cell proliferation, growth and survival. It has also been found to block angiogenesis, the process to create a blood supply to tumors in order to maintain their growth. This is the third drug for kidney cancer to be approved by FDA since late 2005, the earlier two being Bayerâ€™s Nexavar, or sorafenib and Pfizer Inc.'s Sutent, or sunitinib. Common side effects of Torisel include rash, fatigue, mouth sores, nausea, edema and a loss of appetite. Common laboratory abnormalities associated with the drug are high blood sugar, elevated blood lipids and tryglycerides, low RBC, WBC and platelet counts. Also, this study focused on patients with the most advanced tumors. According to Hudes, Torisel can be expected to provide greater benefits to patients with less extensive metastatic disease. Wyeth, in a statement, said its drug would be available for patients in July. The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

Fill out this form to email this article to a friend Spain sues Odyssey Marine Nation files claims against three wrecks found by treasure hunters. Published May 31, 2007 Spain filed suit Wednesday against Tampa&#39;s Odyssey Marine Exploration, and not just over a 17th-century shipwreck it promised to claim earlier this week. Maritime lawyer James Goold said Spain filed claims against three wrecks the Tampa treasure-hunting company has discovered: an Italian-registered passenger boat found last year in the Mediterranean, an unidentified vessel located in March west of Gibraltar, and a 17th-century ship -- code-named "Black Swan" -- whose rich yield of 500, 000 silver coins this month drew international attention and nearly doubled Odyssey&#39;s stock price. "Spain&#39;s legal action this week is based on the same legal principles that resulted in the return of all materials in the Juno and La Galga case, " said Goold, an attorney with Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C. In the Juno case, also argued by Goold, a U.S. court ordered a salvage company to return the treasures it removed from two 18th-century Spanish frigates without that country&#39;s authorization. Spain believes the so-called Black Swan may have sunk in 1641 while under contract with the King and carrying Spanish funds. It&#39;s not clear how strong a legal case Spain may have. Odyssey spokeswoman Natja Igney said it is premature to assess the merit of Spain&#39;s Black Swan claim without knowing the ship&#39;s identity and added that Odyssey expects to reap a substantial salvage award regardless of who claims it. "You are playing right into the hands of lawyers that are trying to sensationalize a straightforward legal proceeding, and further encouraging this type of behavior, " she said. But combined with Spain&#39;s involvement over a fourth shipwreck - its Andalucia region continues to stymie Odyssey&#39;s efforts to excavate a ship it believes to be the 17th-century British warship HMS Sussex, which may have sunk with cargo worth billions of dollars today - the country&#39;s multipronged interventions threaten to prolong Odyssey&#39;s cash crunch by delaying the conversion of treasures into actual revenues. According to its most recent financial report, Odyssey began 2007 with just $2.4-million in cash and burned through $4.7-million during the first quarter. What saved it was a complex $6.6-million equity transaction with some of its top shareholders. Last June, Odyssey refinanced the $1.8-million mortgage on its Tampa headquarters with a $2.5-million loan. Igney, the company spokeswoman, said Odyssey won&#39;t have to seek financing for several months, thanks to $7.7-million generated this month when a shareholder exercised some warrants. Still, cash crunches are nothing new at Odyssey, which seeks to be the first publicly traded shipwreck-recovery company to generate consistent earnings. In prior years, the company sold stakes in specific wrecks or issued them to contractors in lieu of cash. The company&#39;s first major find, the U.S. Civil War-era SS Republic in 2003, generated an unprecedented $75-million in revenues that nevertheless were swiftly consumed by Odyssey&#39;s multiple search-and-recovery projects. Under U.S. District Court rules, Spain has 20 days to issue a specific response to each of Odyssey&#39;s three shipwreck claims. Odyssey&#39;s stock fell five cents Wednesday to $6.80 per share. Since leaping 81 percent to close at $8.32 on May 18, the day it announced its Black Swan find, the company&#39;s stock price has fallen 18 percent.

But Odyssey is not a crack dealing company but a company with pride and dignity, SPAIN is JEALOUS Typical 2nd rate spain. They are always wanting to take something from others.

The high-profile exit will leave two key posts empty at Yahoo, which streamlined operations into three core units last year to compete more effectively with Google and Microsoft. Nazem joined Yahoo in 1996, and became chief technology officer in 1998. Last year, Nazem was appointed to head the company's newly created technology group as part of a management shake up. Sue Decker, then CFO, was named to lead the advertiser & publisher group, while Yahoo is still on the hunt for a good candidate to lead its Audience group that includes consumer services like Yahoo News. Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang will act as interim executive sponsor of the technology group until a successor is named. In a regulatory filing, Yahoo said it would pay Nazem a lump sum payment equal to his base salary for the period from June 8 through December 31, 2007. The stock options granted to Nazem in 2003, 2005 and 2006 would fully vest when he steps down. His right to exercise those options along with some granted in 1999 will extend for three years and depend on his compliance, including an agreement not to engage in "certain competitive activities" for three years. Nazem's departure comes at a time, when Yahoo is banking on Panama - its new marketing platform to distribute ads - to work its magic on the company's revenues in the current and upcoming quarters.

In a regulatory filing, Yahoo said it would pay Nazem a lump sum payment equal to his base salary for the period from June 8 through December 31, 2007. The stock options granted to Nazem in 2003, 2005 and 2006 would fully vest when he steps down. His right to exercise those options along with some granted in 1999 will extend for three years and depend on his compliance, including an agreement not to engage in "certain competitive activities" for three years. Nazem's departure comes at a time, when Yahoo is banking on Panama - its new marketing platform to distribute ads - to work its magic on the company's revenues in the current and upcoming quarters. Yahoo posted an 11% drop in first quarter profits.

Agrees to Buy Photobucket, Flektor Sites (Update3) By Tim Mullaney and Cecile Daurat May 30 (Bloomberg) -- News Corp. agreed to buy Photobucket Inc. and Flektor Inc. to give users of its MySpace social- networking Web site tools to manage digital pictures. Both sites will be added to News Corp.&#39;s Fox Interactive Media unit, the New York-based company said today in a statement. News Corp. didn&#39;t disclose the price, which UBS AG analyst Michael Morris said may be as much as $300 million. ``It makes a lot of sense,&#39;&#39; Morris said. The two sites offer MySpace technology to upgrade its video and picture capabilities and stay current with young users. ``It gives them protection against obsolescence,&#39;&#39; he said. Photobucket and Flektor, along with Google Inc.&#39;s YouTube and Yahoo! Inc.&#39;s Flickr, are capitalizing on the growth of inexpensive digital cameras and high-speed Internet connections. More than 30 million people worldwide visited Photobucket&#39;s Web site in March, almost twice the number a year earlier, according to the research firm ComScore Inc. MySpace accounts for about 40 percent of the links to photos on Photobucket, said Peter Levinsohn, head of Fox Interactive Media unit. The company will continue to operate as a standalone business and News Corp. will help it expand outside the U.S., he said. Photobucket Chief Executive Officer Alex Welch, who will remain with the company as president of the site, said Fox Interactive Media was ``a natural choice&#39;&#39; for Photobucket. News Corp. Class A shares rose 24 cents to $22.43 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have risen 4.4 percent this year. News Corp., led by Rupert Murdoch, is also trying to buy Dow Jones & Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal, for $5 billion. The company bought MySpace for $580 million in October 2005. The site had 107.7 million visitors in March, more than double a year earlier, ComScore said. ``We have an aggressive acquisition strategy,&#39;&#39; Levinsohn said. Photobucket hired Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. to evaluate a sale of the company last year. In May 2006, the company raised $10.5 million from Trinity Ventures and Insight Venture Partners. Flektor provides users with tools to edit and arrange photos and video clips for presentation to others or for posting on blogs and other Web sites. Started last year, Flektor is based in Culver City, California. Photobucket generates most of its revenue from advertising. Users who pay a subscription fee of $25 a year get more storage for their pictures and don&#39;t have to see the ads. ``This gives News Corp. a foot in the door to get MySpace users accustomed to the pay model,&#39;&#39; said New York-based Morris, who rates the shares ``buy&#39;&#39; and doesn&#39;t own any.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/11-2&fd=R&url=http://www.ndtvprofit.com/homepage/news.asp%3Fid%3D300750&cid=1116817306&ei=muxeRt2jO5CUrgOCrPHUDQ Ceridian agrees to be bought for $5.3 bln NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ceridian Corp., under pressure from an activist hedge fund, agreed to be bought by private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners and insurance company Fidelity National Financial Inc. for $5.3 billion, the business services company said on Wednesday. Ceridian had been battling with Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund and major shareholder, which wanted the company to spin off its Comdata division and replace its board. Pershing told Ceridian in a letter earlier this year that the company had "underperformed and failed to achieve its business potential for more than a decade." Ceridian said in a statement on Wednesday it had conducted a "comprehensive review process" in which it evaluated a "number of strategic alternatives available" including options related to Comdata. The all-cash $36-a-share deal is a premium of about 17 percent to Ceridian's closing share price on Feb. 12, the last trading day before it said it retained Greenhill & Co. as financial advisers to explore strategic alternatives. It said the previous month it had hired a financial adviser to help review its business, including a possible Comdata spin-off. Minneapolis-based Ceridian's main human resources outsourcing division offers payroll, benefits administration, and other services to companies. Comdata offers payment processing and is an issuer of credit cards and debit cards. Jacksonville, Florida-based Fidelity National Financial provides title insurance. Title insurance, commonly offered in the United States, gives buyers and lenders protection against defects in a property that later may come to light -- such as a third party having a prior ownership claim on that property. Ceridian's shares closed at $34.19 on Wednesday. The deal is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Sources previously told Reuters that Pershing founder William Ackman felt he and other shareholders stood to make significantly more money should Ceridian be split up rather than sold. In addition to pressure from Pershing, activist investment firm Relational Investors had also been agitating for changes at Ceridian. Relational founder Ralph Whitworth in February wrote to Ceridian and said investors were not satisfied with its performance. But in an April interview, Whitworth said Relational had sold all its Ceridian shares, saying he had "bigger fish to fry." Pershing could not be immediately reached for comment on Wednesday's deal.

The cutback follows a similar move early this month, bringing the total of technology services layoffs at IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., to 3,023 in the second quarter and 3,720 since the start of the year. The cuts amount to roughly 1 percent of IBM's global workforce. In Massachusetts, where the company is one of the largest private employers in the technology industry, IBM issued layoff notices to 72 of its 5,000 employees yesterday. Last month, the company idled 16 employees in the state, bringing its total employment cuts for the quarter to 88, or about 1.6 percent of its Bay State workforce. Most of the state layoffs were in IBM's services group, though a small number were in software and sales, said IBM spokeswoman Elena Fernandez . She said the job cuts reflect an ongoing shift in technology services, where IBM still has a $115 billion backlog. "The nature of the services business is one where there's regular turnover," Fernandez said. "We're always looking to make things more efficient and cost effective, and there's an element of automating." Technology services leaders like IBM and , which design and provide specialized software and business processes for other businesses and consult with them on efficiencies, have been struggling to fend off price competition from Indian outsourcing firms, analysts said. Toward that end, the global providers have been building up their own low-cost sourcing networks in India and elsewhere. Even as IBM has eliminated more than 3,700 services jobs this year, it has hired 19,000 employees . The company would not give a geographic breakdown of where new employees are being hired. "Clearly, this is part of an ongoing attempt by IBM to alter its skill sets and cost structure by moving some implementation resources offshore," suggested Michele J. Cantara , a vice president for research at technology research firm Of the IBM employees in Massachusetts, where the company has grown through acquisition over the past decade, more than two-thirds work in software development, with the rest in sales and services. IBM operations in Cambridge, Lexington, Westford, and Marlborough together make up its largest software cluster in the world.

The lawsuit charges that flight services provided by Jeppesen Dataplan Inc. enabled the clandestine transportation of the suspects to secret overseas locations, where they were tortured and subjected to other "forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment." The ACLU said the company "either knew or reasonably should have known" that they were facilitating the torture of terrorism suspects by providing flight services for the CIA. Companies "are not allowed to have their heads in the sand, and take money from the CIA to fly people, hooded and shackled, to foreign countries to be tortured," ACLU attorney Ben Wizner said. Boeing itself is not named in the lawsuit and would not confirm the reports of a Jeppesen-CIA link, said spokesman Tim Neale, adding that customers have a confidentiality clause. Jeppesen Dataplan says it provides services such as flight plans, fuel and airport data to airlines, private pilots and various companies, but it doesn't ask its customers for details of their business. "We don't know the purpose of the trip for which we do a flight plan," said Mike Pound, a spokesman for the Englewood, Colo.-based Jeppesen. "We don't need to know specific details. It's the customer's business, and we do the business that we are contracted for," he said. "It's not our practice to ever inquire about the purpose of a trip." Jeppesen had no immediate comment on specifics of the lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Northern California, but announced in New York City. The three detainees have claimed through their family and lawyers that they have been tortured and abused against universally accepted legal standards. One claimed to have been routinely tortured under interrogation about al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. Their attorneys appealed to the ACLU for assistance. The cases involve the alleged mistreatment of Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian citizen, in July 2002 and January 2004; Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen, in May 2002; and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian citizen, in December 2001, ACLU officials said at a Manhattan news conference. Mohamed is currently being held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Britel in Morocco and Agiza in Egypt, the ACLU said. The ACLU says the suspects were apprehended under the U.S. government's "extraordinary rendition program." Extraordinary rendition is the clandestine capture and transfer of suspects to be detained and interrogated in countries where the protection of U.S. laws do not apply, according to Wizner. "American corporations should not be profiting from a CIA rendition program that is unlawful and contrary to core American values," said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU. "Corporations that choose to participate in such activity can and should be held legally accountable." Neither the CIA nor the U.S. government is named in the lawsuit. Wizner said the executive branch has evoked a state secrets defense in similar lawsuits. The Bush administration has insisted it receives guarantees from countries receiving terror suspects that prisoners will not be tortured.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/31deal.html&cid Ceridian to Be Taken Private in $5.3 Billion Deal - New York Times Ceridian to Be Taken Private in $5.3 Billion Deal Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 31, 2007 , a human resources company, said last night that it had sold itself to the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners and the specialty insurer for $5.3 billion in cash. The deal values Ceridian at $36 a share, a 5.3 percent premium to its closing price of $34.19 yesterday. In after-hours trading, Ceridian rose $1.41, or 4 percent, to $35.60. Ceridian and its buyers noted, however, that Ceridian was trading at around $31 before Feb. 17, when the company announced that it was putting itself up for sale. The deal represents a 16 percent premium over that price, and a 56 percent premium to Ceridian&#8217;s price on Oct. 6, the day before Ceridian announced Kathryn V. Marinello&#8217;s appointment as chief executive. Last year, Ceridian reported earnings of $174 million, or $1.20 a share, so the merger values the company at 30 times its trailing earnings, compared with about 18 times earnings for the average company in the Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s 500-stock index. Ceridian&#8217;s human resource division offers payroll, tax and benefits services to 110,000 companies, with a combined 25 million employees, in 38 countries. The company also processes payments and issues credit and stored-value cards for the trucking and retail industries. In a statement announcing the deal, Thomas H. Lee and Fidelity said they planned to bring other investors into the transaction. Fidelity will own less than 50 percent of Ceridian at closing and for accounting purposes will not consolidate Ceridian&#8217;s results into its income statement. The transaction will be presented to Ceridian shareholders for approval at the company&#8217;s annual meeting, after the filing of proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ceridian said it would hold its annual meeting no later than Sept. 21.

Consumating a long-rumored deal, Internet auctioneer eBay agreed on Wednesday to acquire social bookmarking site StumbleUpon for $75 million. The popular San Francisco, California-based startup, with almost 2.5 million users and growing by 150 percent annually, allows users to approve or disapprove of websites and then guides them to other sites that users with similar tastes have recommended. A bulletproof method for spending hours of time web surfingâ€”5 million recommendations are made dailyâ€”StumbleUpon provides users with an easy and community-oriented way of discovering new and unexpected sites. In December, StumbleUpon added a video tool, called an â€œin-browser televisionâ€ by one observer, which randomly guides users to videos posted to a variety of websites. StumbleUpon, founded in 2001, has reportedly received $1.5 million in seed financing. It is not immediately clear how StumbleUpon will be integrated into San Jose, California-based eBay. Previous acquisitions, such as Paypal and Skype, were more directly related to eBayâ€™s market-leading Internet auction business. Buyers and sellers had been using Paypal to conduct transactions and Skype was seen as a cheap way to communicate with faraway buyers or sellers. One blogger argued that StumbleUpon would enable eBay to circumvent search giant Google, by embedding a StumbleUpon search box into its Skype client. However, StumbleUpon, with its rapidly growing user base, seems a quick way to acquire a complementary social networking community in what could be a strategy to expand beyond its marketplace roots.

Click me to Spain stakes claim to colonial-era treasure ship found by Florida company In this photo provided by Odyssey Marine Exploration, Ground crew members unload more than 17 tons of silver coins May 16 at an undisclosed location.. (AP Photo/Odyssey Marine Exploration, Jonathan Blair) Phil Davis, Canadian Press Published: Thursday, May 31, 2007 TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - The Spanish government has filed claims in U.S. federal court over a shipwreck that a Florida company found laden with colonial-era treasure, a lawyer said Thursday. If the vessel was Spanish or was removed from that country's waters, any treasure would belong to Spain, said James Goold, a lawyer representing the Madrid government. "It's a very well established principle under Spanish, U.S. and international law that a government such as the kingdom of Spain has not abandoned its sunken ships or sunken property, and that a company like Odyssey Marine Exploration may not conduct recovery operations without authorization by the government," he said. "The kingdom of Spain has not authorized any such operations by Odyssey, and by these legal actions it will see the return of any Spanish property Odyssey has recovered," Goold said of the claims filed Wednesday. Odyssey officials were not available for comment. Odyssey announced two weeks ago that it had discovered a shipwreck containing 500,000 gold and silver coins somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. At the time, Odyssey estimated the value of the find at some US$500 million. Rare-coin expert Nick Bruyer, who was contracted by Tampa-based Odyssey Marine Exploration to examine a batch of coins from the wreck, has described the find as "unprecedented." "I don't know of anything equal or comparable to it," he said in an interview earlier this month. The Tampa-based company said the site was outside any country's territorial waters but would not give the exact location or name of the ship. Odyssey has said that the ship was not in Spanish territorial waters and was not the HMS Sussex, a shipwreck that Odyssey recently got permission from the Spanish government to search for in the Strait of Gibraltar. But Spain has called the new discovery suspicious and said the booty may have come from a wrecked Spanish galleon. In Britain, the find generated press reports that Odyssey had salvaged the wreck of the long-sought British vessel Merchant Royal, which sank in bad weather off England in 1641. Odyssey has not confirmed or denied these reports. Spain is using the U.S. law firm Covington & Burling, which has represented Spain over shipwreck cases before, including the recovery of material from two ships, Juno and La Galga, in a 2000 court case. The Spanish government won that case. Previously the richest-ever shipwreck haul was from the Spanish galleon Nuestra Senora de Atocha, which sank in a hurricane off the Florida Keys in 1622. Treasure-hunting pioneer Mel Fisher found it in 1985, retrieving a reported $400 million in coins and other loot.

Sales at Kmart and Sears stores open at least a year fell 3.9 percent as shoppers curbed purchases of home appliances and health products. Revenue declined 2.5 percent to $11.7 billion, Sears said today in a statement. Comparable-store sales have fallen every quarter since Chairman Edward Lampert joined Sears with Kmart in March 2005 in a $12.3 billion union. Lampert, 44, said earlier this month that fixing retail operations was ``a priority&#39;&#39; for the company. ``They have to take a page out of J.C. Penney&#39;s playbook and revitalize the brands and improve sales,&#39;&#39; said Arun Daniel, who helps manage $40 billion, including Sears shares, at ING Investments LLC in New York. ``That takes time.&#39;&#39; Net income climbed to $216 million, or $1.40 a share, from $180 million, or $1.14, a year earlier. One-time items lifted profit by $44 million, or 30 cents a share, in the three months through May 5. Excluding the gains and charges, the company said it earned $1.10 a share, trailing analysts&#39; estimates of $1.21 a share, the average of seven projections compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, fell $4.35, or 2.4 percent, to $178.90 at 9:39 a.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. They have gained 6.5 percent this year. Same-store sales fell 3.4 percent at the Sears division on sluggish demand for home appliances, which the company attributed to a U.S. housing slump and higher energy prices. Kmart&#39;s same-store sales declined 4.4 percent on lower sales in home goods, health care and most other merchandise categories. Kmart shoppers may have reduced purchases because of higher gasoline prices and poor weather, the company said. Sears earned $18 million after-tax from the legal settlement of a contractual dispute, $16 million from amendments to Sears Canada&#39;s post-retirement benefit plans, a $12 million dividend from an investment in Mexico and $9 million in insurance money from stores damaged by 2005 hurricanes. Sears lost $13 million, or 8 cents, on investments in total-return swaps, agreements in which one investor makes payments based on any coupons and capital gains or losses of an asset and the other makes fixed or floating-rate payments. Sears sells exclusive brands including Kenmore home appliances and Craftsman tools. Earlier this month, the company began a new advertising campaign with the slogan, ``Sears, where it begins.&#39;&#39; At Kmart, it introduced Mr. Bluelight, an animated character who will highlight bargains and unique items for sale. Kmart was known for ``Blue Light Special&#39;&#39; sales in the 1970s and &#39;80s. Lampert said at the company&#39;s shareholder meeting earlier this month that Sears may add more exclusive brands, he said, a strategy that has helped J.C. Penney and Kohl&#39;s Corp. prosper. Gregory Melich, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in Purchase, N.Y., had forecast profit of $1.15 a share on sales of $11.8 billion. There&#39;s a ``newfound willingness on Chairman Eddie Lampert&#39;s part to spend money to improve the business,&#39;&#39; Melich wrote in a May 8 report. The company will need to invest more in stores and operations, he wrote.

The economy grew at a 0.6% annualized pace in the quarter, revised down from the initial estimate of 1.3%, the government said in its second estimate of quarterly gross domestic product. It was the slowest growth since late 2002. Read the full government report. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch were expecting GDP to be revised to 0.7%. The economy has grown just 1.9% in the past four quarters, well below the 3% growth most economists say is the long-run potential. It's the weakest year-over-year growth in four years. Consumers continued to lead the way in the first quarter with strong gains in spending and income, which were revised even higher than in the first estimate. The business sector, however, invested little and saw year-over-year before-tax profit growth fall to the lowest level of the five-year-old expansion. "The details of the report suggest some reasons for even more optimism for the second quarter," wrote Drew Matus, an economist for Lehman Bros. The faster businesses cut their inventories, the sooner they'll be ready to ramp up production again. Considering the large upward revision to consumer spending, the report "will widely be viewed as a positive when the details are scoured," wrote Tony Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist for Miller Tabak & Co. Although the drags from inventories and home building will lessen in coming quarters, consumer spending is weakening, he said. "The composition of GDP will turn unfavorable in the second quarter, putting into question the sustainability of a rebound in GDP," Crescenzi said. Data on consumer spending will be the main variable to watch. The revisions do little to change the broad picture of an American economy bolstered by the steady consumer, but weakened by a sickly housing market and a cautious business sector. In nominal terms (not adjusted for inflation), the economy grew 4.7% to $13.6 trillion annualized. Fed officials seem to be looking past the grim first-quarter growth data to a rebound later this year. In the minutes of the May 9 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee released on Wednesday, Fed officials unanimously voiced the view that inflation, not recession, remains the greater risk. Economy-wide inflation surged at the fastest pace in 16 years, and core consumer inflation accelerated a bit above the Federal Reserve's comfort zone. The GDP price index increased 4% annualized, the most since 1991. The core personal consumption price index increased at a 2.2% annual rate and is up 2.2% in the past year, above the 1% to 2% target zone for the Fed. The chances of any change this year in the Fed's interest rate target have evaporated in recent months. Recent signs point to reinvigorated capital spending. However, hopes for a quick rebound in housing have been dashed by further declines in key indicators. And consumer spending has started the second quarter on a weak note. In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefits fell 4,000 last week to 310,000, a sign that layoffs remain relatively rare. The government will report on May nonfarm payrolls on Friday, with economists expecting a gain of 150,000. Real consumer spending increased 4.4% annualized, the fastest in a year, compared with the 3.8% initial estimate. Spending on durable goods increased 8.8%, spending on nondurable goods rose 3.5% and spending on services increased 4%. With the 4.2% gain in the fourth quarter, it was the best back-to-back performance for consumer spending in four years, noted David Greenlaw, an economist for Morgan Stanley. Consumer spending contributed 3 percentage points to growth. Real disposable personal incomes increased at a 4.7% annual rate in the first quarter, boosted by a $50 billion disbursement of annual bonuses. Fourth-quarter income was revised higher by $33 billion from wages and salaries. Investments in houses dropped at a 15.4% annual pace, revised from 17% earlier. It's the sixth consecutive decline. Residential investments cut 1 percentage point from growth. Business fixed investments increased at a 2.9% annual pace, revised up from 2% earlier. Investments in equipment and software rose 2%, while investments in structures increased 5.1%. Business investments contributed 0.3 percentage points to growth. Inventories shrank by $4.5 billion. The change in inventory investment cut 1 percentage point from growth. Corporate profits before tax increased $20.3 billion, or 1.2%, to $1.67 trillion after falling $4.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Before-tax profits are up 6.3% in the past year, the weakest year-over-year growth since the fourth quarter of 2001. After-tax profits rose 1% in the first quarter and are up 6.4% in the past year. Nonfinancial corporate profits rose $16.2 billion, while financial corporate profits rose $4.8 billion. Exports fell 0.6%, the biggest decline in four years. Meanwhile, imports rose 5.7%. The trade deficit cut 1 percentage point from growth. Government spending rose 1% in the first quarter. Federal spending fell 3.9%, including a 7.3% drop in national defense spending. State and local government spending rose 3.9%. Government spending contributed 0.2 percentage points to growth. Rex Nutting is Washington bureau chief of MarketWatch.

Northwest Airlines Corp. exited bankruptcy on Thursday with creditors agreeing on a reorganization plan and the airline's flight attendants voting to accept a new labor agreement -- albeit barely, by just about 100 votes. The Eagan, Minn.-based carrier's new shares debuted Thursday, under the symbol NWA , and notched early gains of about 2% in New York Stock Exchange trading. The company's previous stock was delisted from Nasdaq in September 2005 after the carrier entered bankruptcy. The optimism that accompanied many of carriers' journeys through bankruptcy -- predicated on the shedding of debt and costly airplane leases and the freezing or jettisoning of pension obligations -- has helped the industry prepare better, though not fully, for the realities of mid-2007. Stubbornly high jet fuel prices, softening demand for travel and an excess of seats have hindered airline profit in recent quarters, renewing calls for mergers that would substantially trim available seat miles and associated costs. The new Northwest shares carried an initial price of $27 each, but like Delta shares earlier this year and United Airlines parent UAL Corp.'s post-Chapter 11 shares in early 2006, that price tag was too high. The trading marks the final return to solid footing for the last of the so-called legacy carriers that, starting with U.S. Airways in August 2002, began a long slide into bankruptcy. The trading marks the final return to solid footing for the last of the so-called legacy carriers that, starting with U.S. Airways in August 2002, began a long slide into bankruptcy. The airline's chief executive, Doug Steenland, said Northwest emerged from its 20 months in bankruptcy with more than $3 billion in cash and was looking forward to a "very strong" summer travel season. "It's a great day for the airline business," he said. Listen to the full interview. Northwest entered Chapter 11 in September 2005, as did rival Delta Air Lines Inc. the same day. Delta emerged earlier this year, and like Northwest, has shed labor costs and airplane leasing agreements. Northwest was able to reduce its costs by about $2.2 billion, including $1.4 billion in labor and pension expenses, and to shrink its aircraft fleet and reduce seating capacity by about 10%. "Northwest did not face as many problems to fix as did Delta upon entering bankruptcy because Northwest's non-labor costs were in fairly good shape, and their revenue generation was broadly comparable to their legacy airline peers," said Standard & Poor's airline analyst Philip Baggaley. But the carrier, despite its fresh-start accounting, is forecasting weak second-quarter demand, as the industry grapples with an oversupply of passenger seats and a softening U.S. economy. International route revenue remains strong, according to Northwest, which is the No. 1 U.S. carrier to Japan. Northwest in early April offered 27.8 million new shares as part of its exit from bankruptcy, with J.P. Morgan Securities acting as underwriter. General unsecured claimants received new stock worth between 66% and 83% of their allowed claims, the airline said in its federal filing. Delta's recently issued shares have slipped about 7% in their first month of trading -- a period during which the Amex Airline Index ( ) , composed of 11 airline stocks, gained about 6%. Delta's shares aren't part of the Amex benchmark. "For the first since 2002 there are no major airlines in bankruptcy. It seems weird," said Baggaley. "The industry situation has certainly improved -- there's a better balance of supply and demand. But fuel prices are higher now than they were at the start of that period, and the big airlines still are carrying a lot of debt and other financial obligations."

Explain to interested patients that there are few treatments for advanced renal cell carcinoma and they are of limited efficacy and considerable toxicity, especially in cases where the tumor burden is extensive. Note that this study found that a new drug, temsirolimus, prolongs survival and is better tolerated than a standard treatment, interferon alfa, in patients with metastatic disease. And in a rare confluence of research results and regulatory action, on the same day that the pivotal randomized trial was published in the New England Journal of Medicine the drug was approved by the FDA for the indication. For patients getting the drug, median survival was 3.6 months longer than for those getting standard treatment with interferon alfa, Gary Hudes, M.D., of the Fox Chase Cancer Center, and colleagues in the Global ARCC Trial, reported in the May 31 issue of the A third arm of the industry-sponsored study, combining temsirolimus and interferon alfa, did not show any survival benefit over interferon alfa alone, Dr. Hudes and colleagues found. "This is the first study to show that a new drug can improve overall survival for patients with metastatic renal cell cancer," Dr. Hudes said. Early last year, sutinib (Sutent) was approved to treat metastatic renal cell carcinoma, but the studies involving that drug showed improvement in progression-free survival, rather than overall survival. Similarly, sorafenib (Nexavar) was approved in December 2005 on the basis of a delay in disease progression in renal cell carcinoma. While the survival improvement with temsirolimus therapy is "modest," Dr. Hudes said, patients in the study had very advanced tumors. "It would be reasonable to hypothesize that temsirolimus could provide greater benefit to patients with less extensive metastatic disease," Dr. Hudes said. The current study was stopped at the second interim analysis, the researchers said, when 446 of the 626 patients had died and there was significant evidence (at In the study, patients were randomized to 25 mg of temsirolimus intravenously once a week; to interferon alfa, at a dose escalating from three million to 18 million units, subcutaneously three times a week; or to a combination of 15 mg of temsirolimus weekly and six million units of interferon alfa three times a week. Median survival for patients getting temsirolimus was 10.9 months, compared with 7.3 months for interferon alfa and 8.4 months for the combination. For temsirolimus patients, the hazard ratio for death, compared to interferon alfa, was 0.73 (with a 95% confidence interval from 0.58 to 0.92), which was significant at Overall survival for patients in the combination group did not differ significantly from those getting interferon alfa. Dr. Hudes and colleagues said the lack of efficacy in the combination group may have been a result of the lower dose of temsirolimus. The study also showed a significantly longer period of progression-free survival ( Temsirolimus was better tolerated than interferon-alfa, with 67% of patients in the temsirolimus group having Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, compared with 78% of interferon patients and 87% of patients in the combination group. Both differences were significant at The study was supported by Wyeth Research, which is developing temsirolimus. Dr. Hudes reported financial links to Pfizer Pharmaceuticals and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. Other authors reported financial links to industrial concerns including Wyeth, Novartis, Chiron, Bayer, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, and Genentech. Three of the authors, Timothy O'Toole, Stephanie Lustgarten, and Laurence Moore, M.D., Ph.D., are full-time employees of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals.

(AP) -- A bomb scare at a Massachusetts bank branch proved to be a false alarm after an internal fax transmission about a Bank of America promotion was misinterpreted as a threat. The bank branch's manager called police shortly after 10:00 A.M. The State Police bomb squad was sent and authorities evacuated nearly a dozen businesses in the shopping plaza, including a day care center. The evacuation was lifted after it was learned the fax had been sent by a marketing group for a promotion to kick off a special offer from the bank. A Bank of American spokesman says the fax contained images of a lighted match and a bomb with a fuse. A page with text explaining the promotion failed to come through because of a transmission error. Fears also arose in part because the transmission came in just as a suspicious package was delivered to the branch. It's not the first time a marketing ploy has touched off a bomb scare in the Boston area. Bomb squads were sent out in January to check out blinking devices that had been placed as a promotion for a Cartoon Network program. (Copyright 2007 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)

Assistant U.S. attorney Eric Sussman offered no explanation for why he asked Judge Amy St. Eve for approval to drop the money-laundering charge, which was added to the indictment in December, 2005. Lord Black was the only one among four co-defendants who was facing the charge. Edward Genson, a defence attorney representing Lord Black, quipped, "OK, I guess I can go" as the charge was dropped. The 16- member jury was not present and attorneys in the case were discussing issues related to the trial, including upcoming evidence. Evan Agostini, Getty Images Email to a friend The decision provided a bright spot for the defence before the jury arrived and prosecutors introduced into evidence a stack of documents found inside the 13 boxes that Lord Black was videotaped removing from Hollinger Inc.'s office in Toronto. The boxes included receipts for purchases Lord Black had made at a number of luxury stores, among them more than US$116,000 at Yves St. Laurent, US$101,550 at Fendi and US$2.62-million at Graff Diamonds Limited. Prosecutor Jeffrey Cramer also flashed bank statements showing a deposit made to Lord Black for US$4.3-million from American Publishing Company on April 9, 2001. Mr. Cramer also displayed travel documents from Tekura Tahiti Travel related to Lord Black's trip to Bora Bora. An original copy of a contract signed by Lord Black was also shown to the jury. The contents of the battered office boxes, which have been sitting in front of the jurors on a trolley in the courtroom for days, had largely remained a mystery to them until yesterday. The jury also saw an e-mail that Lord Black sent to co-defendant Peter Atkinson on Jan. 17, 2003, referring to a public company as a "vehicle for extracting money, as in the non-competes." After presenting the jury with the flurry of documents, Mr. Sussman announced, "At this time, the prosecution rests." After jurors filed out of the courtroom, Lord Black and his wife, Barbara Amiel, left the room holding hands. The press baron had a faint smile on his lips. The U.S. government alleges Lord Black and other senior Hollinger International executives misappropriated US$60-million in bonuses disguised as non-compete payments from Hollinger International during the sale of newspaper assets. Lord Black is facing an additional charge of obstruction of justice, which is directly linked to the removal of the boxes. After the jurors had left for the day, Marc Martin, a defence lawyer for Lord Black, yesterday applied to Judge St. Eve to have all of the charges against the press baron dismissed. He took particular exception with the obstruction of justice charge, arguing that were it not for an Ontario court order that prevented the removal of documents from Hollinger Inc. in May 2005, the charge would have no basis. "We don't know what Mr. Black's intention was," Mr. Martin argued, pointing out that the press baron had been ordered to vacate the office by the end of the month. John Mayer acts out a bizarre ...

Farzad Nazem's plans to leave the Sunnyvale-based company were disclosed Wednesday in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing and a posting on Yahoo's Web site. The resignation becomes effective June 8, just six months after Yahoo named Nazem head of the company's newly created technology group as part of a management shake up. He had already been Yahoo's chief technology officer since April 1998, two years after he first joined the company as senior vice president of product development. While Yahoo searches for Nazem's replacement, company co-founder Jerry Yang will oversee the technology group as interim "executive sponsor." Fellow co-founder David Filo also will continue his focus on technology, the company said in statement. In the posting on Yahoo's Web site, Nazem, 45, said he simply wants to retire. "After spending the last 26 years in this fast-paced technology industry, I've finally decided it's time to slow down," wrote Nazem, who also worked at business software maker Oracle Corp. before joining Yahoo. Nazem's departure comes at a pivotal time for Yahoo. After suffering an 11 percent drop in its first-quarter profit, Yahoo is banking on long-awaited improvements to its advertising platform to boost its fortunes during the second half of this year. In the Web posting, Nazem said he delayed his retirement until the new advertising formula - known as the "Panama" project - was completed and he felt confident that his mission had been accomplished. "With all this in place now, I know I'm leaving a strong, dedicated, and focused organization that is ready to define the next wave of the Internet revolution," Nazem wrote. Yahoo parted ways with another of its top executives, former Chief Operating Officer Dan Rosensweig, at the end of March. Rosensweig left as part of the management shake up announced in early December. Yahoo is still looking for a new executive to oversee the "audience" group that was formed as part of that reorganization. Nazem will walk away from Yahoo as a wealthy man, having made millions by exercising the stock options that he accumulated during his tenure. In the last four years alone, Nazem has realized $213 million in gains by exercising some of his stock options, according to SEC filings. Under his separation agreement, Nazem will retain the rights to another 2.97 million stock options with exercise prices ranging between $20.58 and $34.75 per share as long he adheres to certain restrictions, including a three-year prohibition against taking a job with Yahoo rivals Google Inc. or Microsoft Corp. Yahoo also will pay Nazem the balance of his $500,000 salary and accelerate the vesting rights of his restricted stock in the company, according to SEC documents. Most of Nazem's stock options are currently worthless because Yahoo's market value has sagged since the end of 2005. Yahoo shares dipped 2 cents to finish Wednesday's regular trading at $28.38, then shed another 18 cents in extending trading after the disclosure of Nazem's resignation.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/technology/31yahoo.html&cid Yahoo Technology Chief to Leave in Wake of Company Revamping - New York Times Yahoo Technology Chief to Leave in Wake of Company Revamping Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 31, 2007 SAN FRANCISCO, May 30 — Farzad Nazem, ’s chief technology officer and one of its longest-serving executives, said he would leave on June 8 after 11 years at the company. Yahoo said its co-founder, Jerry Yang, would assume Mr. Nazem’s responsibilities while it searches for a replacement. The departure of Mr. Nazem, 45, who is known as Zod, will follow a turbulent year at Yahoo that included a companywide revamping. Several other senior executives, including the chief operating officer, have left in the wake of the overhaul. Yahoo would not make Mr. Nazem or any other executive available to discuss his departure. But a spokeswoman, Joanna Stevens, said that Mr. Nazem had wanted to retire and that he and the chief executive, Terry S. Semel, had been planning his departure for some time. Writing in the company’s , Mr. Nazem said, “As I began contemplating retirement, there were a few milestones that I (along with the executive leadership team) wanted to accomplish prior to my departure.” Those milestones, he wrote, included the reorganization of the company and its technology group, as well as the introduction of an advertising platform, known as Project Panama, which Yahoo began introducing in February. “It was very important to me,” Mr. Nazem said, “to drive all the way to my last day here at Yahoo without distractions of an announcement like this.” The new advertising platform is aimed at narrowing the lead of in online advertising, but it has yet to translate into financial gains for the company. Mr. Nazem, who is responsible for the operation of the Yahoo Web site and for product development, was popular among the company’s technology ranks, whom he largely helped hire. This month, Yahoo appointed Blake Jorgensen, a founder of Thomas Weisel Partners, as chief financial officer, replacing Susan L. Decker, who is switching roles to become head of the company’s advertiser and publisher group. Yahoo is looking for an executive to lead its audience group, which is responsible for much of the main company Web site. After Mr. Nazem’s departure, Yahoo is likely to have vacant positions at the top of two of its three operating units. As part of his separation agreement, Mr. Nazem will receive a lump sum equal to his base salary for the rest of the year as well as accelerated vesting of stock options and stock awards, a package that an executive compensation firm, Equilar, estimated around $6.9 million.

( CHICAGO (Reuters) - Northwest Airlines is set to exit bankruptcy on Thursday, marking the end of a 20-month spell in Chapter 11 for the No. 5 U.S. carrier, and the first time in almost five years that a major U.S. airline has not been in bankruptcy. Northwest has spent the last year and a half hacking $2.4 billion off its annual costs, mostly from an aggrieved work force. Like other so-called "legacy' airlines, it has been forced to drastically slash its costs to keep pace with newer low-cost carriers and deal with wild spikes in fuel costs. The company will officially relaunch as a slimmed-down carrier when Chief Executive Doug Steenland rings the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Its shares will trade on the Big Board, marking the first time Northwest stock has changed hands on a major public exchange since it was delisted from Nasdaq in September 2005. Northwest's emergence from bankruptcy protection appears to signal the end of a five-year period of extreme turbulence for U.S airlines, as it and its rivals have made huge strides toward ensuring their long-term survival. But despite major cost cuts, Northwest faces intense competition, soaring fuel prices and furious employees who resent forfeiting $1.4 billion annually only to see their bosses net enormous payouts from stock and options awards. Employee rage swelled this month when the company revealed a management compensation plan that awards Steenland stock and options potentially worth more than $20 million. "Northwest may be emerging from Chapter 11, but it has a long way to go," said Anthony Sabino, a law professor at St. John's University in New York. "Much of the carrier's unionized work force is tremendously unhappy. And in an intensely competitive and service-oriented industry such as the airlines, the bad blood could cost Northwest dearly, if not doom it altogether," he said. SURVIVING IN A TROUBLED INDUSTRY Northwest, which has cut its debt and leasing obligations by $4.2 billion, is not facing these challenges alone. Three of the big U.S. carriers --- Northwest, Delta Air Lines and UAL Corp's United Airlines -- have all been in Chapter 11 in the last five years. US Airways Group also went bankrupt and was saved from liquidation only by a merger with America West Airlines. AMR Corps. American Airlines restructured without entering bankruptcy. Without exception these airlines grappled with peeved workers, low-fare competition and soaring fuel prices. The industry mounted a recovery in 2006 thanks to a string of revenue-boosting fare rises, but several failed fare increases in 2007 suggest rising fares are at an end. Meanwhile, domestic competition is increasingly vigorous thanks to new entrants such as Virgin America Airlines and Skybus Airlines Inc. Consequently, top airlines have warned of excess domestic capacity, which could erode pricing power. In a government filing on Tuesday, Northwest predicted softening domestic revenue in 2007 due to industry supply increases and a slowing economy. "I think they are very sensitive to the tenuous state of domestic demand," said Velocity Group airline consultant Doug Abbey. He said, however, that Northwest is better positioned than most airlines to support higher fares because of its dominance at its hubs in Detroit and Minneapolis. "They really dominate those airports with relatively little low-cost competition," Abbey said. "They're in a strong position to maintain higher yields." Some airlines have reacted by moving capacity to lucrative international routes where they face less competition. Northwest also has tweaked its domestic operations by acquiring its regional partner Mesaba Airlines. It also has launched a regional subsidiary called Compass Airlines. Some, such as US Airways CEO Doug Parker, have said airline mergers are the key to long-term survival as they alleviate excess capacity. Early this year, talk of potential industry consolidation was rampant. Speculation died down in recent months, although some still believe consolidation is in the cards -- perhaps even a Northwest-Delta merger. In January, Delta beat back a hostile takeover bid from US Airways, which in 2005 merged with America West Airlines. "I'm just presuming, absent any crisis, airlines will do moderately well over the next six months, and then if things go south ... then I think we'd see consolidation rear its ugly head again," Abbey said.

The move comes after the company had previously announced it would slash 3,500 posts by June 30. The move comes after the company had previously announced it would slash 3,500 posts by June 30 Motorola, which has been losing market share to rivals such as Nokia due to a lack of advanced phones and tough price competition, had said in April that it would announce additional cost-cutting plans by June. The latest planned cuts at the company, which had 66,000 employees at the end of 2006, will be made by the end of the year. The company forecasts the combined job losses and other cost-cutting moves will save the firm $600 million (&pound;304m) a year. Mobile phone analyst Lawrence Harris said Motorola would need better phone models to impress investors. He added: "It will certainly help them return to profitability but it&#39;s not enough to get them to the double digit profit margins they seek. They need exciting new products."

Rex Tillerson, Exxon's chief executive officer, told reporters at the company's annual meeting in Dallas yesterday that the $16.2-billion price tag for the 1,200-kilometre natural gas pipeline means that it is not viable without sizable federal aid. &#34;We are now in a situation where it's not economic at current costs,&#34; Mr. Tillerson said, noting the tremendous inflation that has plagued oil field construction projects. He said it is not clear if the federal government will come forward with a package of royalty and tax breaks large enough to provide the project sponsors with a decent rate of return. Print Edition - Section Front More Report on Business Stories The last of the wildcatters Thick-skinned iconoclast packs it in Workplace guidelines needed for 'mobile snacking' Exxon warns it will shelve Mackenzie pipe without subsidy Lots of hype, but a slow road for Web TV Go to the Report on Business section &#34;It may just be that the project is going to have to wait for a different cost environment,&#34; he said. The pipeline would carry up to 1.9 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from the Canadian Arctic to Alberta, and is seen as a critical piece of infrastructure in opening the North to resource development. Exxon owns 69.6 per cent of of Calgary, which is leading the project, currently under review by the National Energy Board. Earlier this year, Imperial announced that the projected cost for the Mackenzie Valley pipeline had ballooned to $16.2-billion from $7.5-billion, and that the partners would require &#34;an appropriate fiscal framework&#34; from the government to allow it to go ahead. Since then, the company and the federal government have been in discussions, although industry insiders believe Imperial is asking far more than Ottawa is prepared to give. Imperial spokesman Pius Rolheiser said yesterday that the company remains committed to the pipeline construction and continues to negotiate with northern native groups and the government as it pursues regulatory approval. &#34;Yes, it's economically challenged, yes we're concerned about its competitiveness, and to that end, we continue to work with the federal government on a fiscal framework that makes sense for the project, which we see as key to improving its competitiveness,&#34; he said. But Mr. Rolheiser would not repeat Mr. Tillerson's assertion that the project is &#34;uneconomic,&#34; retreating to the more vague description, &#34;economically challenged.&#34; Nor would he comment on Mr. Tillerson's suggestion that the project might be shelved. Bill Rodgers, a spokesman for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, Jim Prentice, said the minister was unaware of Mr. Tillerson's comments, but that the government has had no indication Imperial is ready to walk away from the project or put it on the shelf. &#34;Nothing has changed as far as we can tell,&#34; he said. UBS Securities analyst Andrew Potter said it has been clear for some time that Imperial was unwilling to move forward with the project unless it gets generous tax and royalty breaks from Ottawa. Mr. Potter said he believes the pipeline project could yield an 8-per-cent rate of return at current natural gas prices on spot markets, but noted that Exxon and Imperial are notoriously cautious about using conservative price estimates for project planning. &#34;Uneconomic means different things to different people,&#34; he said. The analyst added that the federal government is hesitant to be seen as providing subsidies to the world's most profitable oil company but, at the same time, is eager to see the project proceed because it would open the North to further natural gas development. &#34;It's a strategic project for the nation; it's a strategic project for North American gas supply,&#34; he said.

It turns out the problem was closer to home, too. Yesterday, federal officials announced that a manufacturing plant in was using the same banned substance, melamine, to make binding agents that ended up in feed for farmed fish, shrimp and livestock. The problem surfaced after a distributor, concerned about what was in its feed binders after the reports from China, sent the product to a private laboratory for testing. The melamine was used by BTLSR, a Canadian forest products company with a small chemical plant in Toledo, to make binding agents that keep pellets of animal feed together, said Dr. David Acheson, assistant commissioner for food protection at the Food and Drug Administration Melamine is not permitted in food or pet food products. In the last few months, pet food contaminated with melamine, all traced back to China, sickened or killed thousands of pets in the United States. Dr. Acheson said the levels of melamine and melamine-related compounds in Tembec&#8217;s products were far lower than that found in wheat flour from China that ended up killing the pets. Consequently, the authorities said that they thought the contamination did not appear to pose a risk to human health. Nevertheless, the F.D.A. issued a voluntary recall of finished feed made with two binding agents: Aquabond and Aqua-Tec II, which are made by Tembec and used in fish and shrimp feed. A third product, Xtra-Bond, which is made by a Colorado firm called Uniscope using Tembec ingredients, was not recalled because the levels of melamine were low. Uniscope is the distributor of all three products. Aquabond and Aqua-Tec II are sold mostly overseas; Xtra-Bond is sold domestically. Agency officials are alerting the foreign governments that received the products, Dr. Acheson said. The investigation began on May 18 when Uniscope alerted the agency that it had discovered melamine in the testing. Dr. Acheson said that the investigation was in its early stages and that some questions remained unanswered, like how long Tembec had used melamine in its products and the extent of the contamination. &#8220;What Tembec knew, didn&#8217;t know, what their activities were, is part of the investigation,&#8221; Dr. Acheson said, at a news conference. Earlier, he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to believe that a manufacturer of pet food would not know about this.&#8221; Federal officials would not say whether they would pursue criminal charges in the Tembec case. They said that they had already been contacting domestic manufacturers to make sure they were aware of the sources of their ingredients. John Valley, Tembec&#8217;s executive vice president for business development and corporate affairs, said his company thought that Uniscope was shipping the binders overseas for use as shrimp feed. Once the F.D.A. told it that the binders were being used domestically, Tembec stopped making them from melamine, Mr. Valley said. Tembec makes resins and certain chemicals for industrial uses, including melamine. Mr. Valley said Uniscope was the only customer that used its products for animal feed. Asked why it was all right to use melamine in feed for shrimp overseas but not in the United States, he said: &#8220;Melamine has just really had a focus that&#8217;s come upon it. A lot of companies and agencies are reviewing certain applications of melamine.&#8221; The pet food scandal has led to increased scrutiny of all food imports, particularly those from China, and threatened trade relations. Some members of Congress have demanded tougher inspections of food imports from China. &#8220;This recent incident goes to show that we apparently have some bad actors out there,&#8221; said Michael Doyle, director of the Center for Food Safety at the . &#8220;It can happen in the United States.&#8221; But Mr. Doyle pointed out that the incidence of food illness remains relatively rare in the United States. The problem with the Tembec binders surfaced after Uniscope, a company based in Johnstown, Colo., decided to test the binders. &#8220;They just asked themselves, &#8216;I wonder what&#8217;s in this stuff? I wonder if we have anything in here that shouldn&#8217;t be in here?&#8217; &#8221; said Charlie Russell, a company spokesman. &#8220;So they sent some samples to a lab.&#8221; Tembec has been a supplier to Uniscope since January 2004, Mr. Russell said. Employees at Uniscope, which was founded in 1975 and is family owned, thought that they were buying a resin that was fit for animal consumption, Mr. Russell said. Uniscope sells the binders to feed manufacturers that mix them with grain and other ingredients to make food pellets for livestock and fish, he said. The binders are sold both domestically and abroad, Mr. Russell said. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tembec acquired BTLSR Toledo, a custom manufacturer of spray-dry resins, for $8.5 million in 2003.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Wednesday said it has alerted manufacturers of feed for livestock, fish and shrimp to a voluntary recall of products made by Tembec BTLSR Inc. of Toledo, Ohio. The FDA said Tembec had added melamine, an agent used in plastics and fire retardants but unfit for use in food, to animal feed agents to improve the product's texture. The FDA said Tembec is a contract manufacturer for another company, Uniscope Inc. of Johnstown, Colo. The FDA said that small amounts of melamine detected in the feed products suggest that the "consumption of pork, chicken, domestic fish and eggs from animals inadvertently fed animal feed contaminated with melamine and its analogues is very unlikely to pose a human health risk." China Refuses Shipment of Evian But the agency said the products made by Tembec and Uniscope also reportedly contained "a urea formaldehyde resin-type ingredient," a raw ingredient used to make the binding agent in these products. The FDA says it is investigating that as well. The findings are likely to have a significant impact because in recent months world-wide alarm over the appearance of melamine in pet food and animal feed has centered on China. Beijing has borne the brunt of global criticism over laxity in supervising its food producers. In late March, the FDA identified a small Chinese manufacturer in Jiangsu province as the source of melamine in wheat flour shipped to the U.S. The chemical was detected in pet food ingredients and linked to a number of deaths in cats and dogs in the U.S., leading to a massive product recall. The FDA yesterday added that "the companies have confirmed that Tembec added melamine as part of the formulation of the products to improve the binding properties of pelleted feed. Melamine is not approved as an additive" for any food, including animal feed. The companies have stopped adding melamine to their products, the FDA said. Tembec BTLSR is a subsidiary of Tembec Inc., a forest products company based in Montreal, Canada, which manufacturers newsprint and chemicals, among other products. Tembec Inc., whose shares are listed on the Toronto stock exchange, reported annual sales of 3.3 billion Canadian dollars in 2006 and a net loss of C$304 million for 2005 and 2006. The company employs around 9,000 people. In its 2006 annual report, Tembec Inc. said that one of its manufacturing facilities located in Toledo, Ohio, manufactures melamine. A man who answered the phone at the office of Tembec BTLSR declined to comment on the FDA report, referring questions to John Valley, an official of the company. A message left for Mr. Valley late Wednesday night in Ohio wasn't immediately returned. Messages left late Wednesday night for officials in the public affairs division of Tembec Inc. also weren't immediately returned. There was no answer at Uniscope's office in Colorado late Wednesday night.

Net income rose to $216 million, or $1.40 a share, in the first quarter ended on May 5, from $180 million, or $1.14 a share, a year earlier. In early May, Sears said it expected net income of $1.30 to $1.53 a share. Sears Holdings Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer talks at the NASDAQ market site in New York as Sears Holdings Corporation (SHLD) is listed for the first time, March 28, 2005. Retailer Sears Holdings Corp. posted a 20 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by a legal settlement and other special gains, but sales declined at both its Sears and Kmart units. REUTERS/Jeff Christensen Email to a friend Excluding special items, earnings fell to $1.10 per share from $1.11. Analysts on average were expecting $1.22, according to Reuters Estimates. "In part, our domestic operating results reflect the impact of some of the same challenges being faced by our customers, such as rising energy costs and a slower housing market," Chief Executive Aylwin Lewis said in a release. "However, as an organization, we need to overcome these factors by better controlling costs and developing innovative solutions that better meet our customers' needs." Sales fell 2.5 percent to $11.7 billion, and U.S. comparable-store sales were down 3.9 percent. By brand, comparable-store sales, also known as comps, declined 3.4 percent at Sears and fell 4.4 percent at Kmart. The results came in at the lower end of the forecast the company provided on May 3, Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said in a note to clients. "Surprisingly, comps at Sears were a full point lower, at -3.4 percent, than they projected with two days to go in the quarter," he said. "Must have been a tough last weekend (or may reflect the apples to apples comps they reported which they may not have used in their preliminary report)." The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based company's cash balance came to $3.4 billion. Investors watch Sears' cash position closely because the company has given Chairman Edward Lampert authority to invest excess money as he sees fit. The latest results include gains from a legal settlement, benefit plans at Sears Canada , a dividend from Sears Mexico and hurricane-related recoveries. Sears shares were down $4.09, or 2.2 percent, at $179.16 in morning Nasdaq trade. At Wednesday's close, the stock had risen about 9 percent this year and traded in a 52-week range of $195.18 to $134.56. John Mayer acts out a bizarre ...

Aun Part of the ECT News Network 05/30/07 11:24 AM PT Rupert Murdoch's Fox Interactive Media has purchased the photo-sharing site Photobucket as well as Web tool provider Flektor. The purchase price was undisclosed; however, it is rumored to be in the neighborhood of $250 million. The deal comes just weeks after a high-profile tiff between Photobucket and Murdoch's MySpace social networking site. Complete Control Over Your Site A HostMySite VPS is the right solution when you need more control over your hosting. With root access, you can install applications and customize your own secure VPS environment, all at a much lower cost than a dedicated server. Rupert Murdoch, who lost a chance to buy last year when the massive video-hosting site was gobbled up by , has snagged two other Internet companies that are popular with young people: Murdoch's Fox Interactive Media (FIM), which owns the heavily visited social networking hub , announced the acquisition Wednesday. Photobucket is a photo- and video-sharing site used by many MySpace members. Flektor provides Web-based tools for photo and video editing and mashups. Terms of the deals were not revealed, but Reuters recently reported the Photobucket acquisition would cost Murdoch about US$250 million. The purchase comes close on the heels of a public dispute between Photobucket and MySpace during which MySpace blocked its users from accessing to Photobucket. Photobucket, based in Denver, says it has about 42 million users. That makes it the world's largest photo-sharing Web site. Its huge success, despite being online for only about four years, is the result of its affiliation with Web 2.0 social networking sites, including MySpace, that feed on users' desires for self-expression and interaction. Photobucket "is expected to remain in operation as a stand-alone site" but its technology and tools will be shared with other FIM sites "as well as the more than 300,000 other Web sites linked to by Photobucket's users," FIM said. The purchase of Photobucket and Flektor "is a perfect strategic fit" for his company, FIM President Peter Levinsohn said. "As a leading site for creative expression, Photobucket extends our reach among personal media sharing enthusiasts, and the innovative new entrant Flektor brings highly-differentiated new tools to the table that will drive the next generation," said Levinsohn. That sweet-talk marks quite a turnaround from the animosity expressed just last month by representatives of MySpace and Photobucket. MySpace, contending Photobucket violated MySpace's terms of service by sticking advertisements inside image files, blocked its users from posting Photobucket-stored slide shows and videos. In response, Photobucket told its customers MySpace was "showing that it considers you as a commodity which it can treat as it sees fit." Negotiations ensued and two weeks later, Photobucket announced it had "established open lines of communication and procedures with MySpace to prevent a sudden block of Photobucket content in the future." Although Murdoch had his eyes on YouTube, Google beat him to the punch by paying $1.65 billion for the site last October. All the wheeling and dealing reveals several trends are afoot, according to Jupiter Research analyst Barry Parr. "We've been saying for a while now that social networking services are turning into portals," he told TechNewsWorld. "I think this is piece of what we are seeing here. Clearly, MySpace knows it's in a position to drive traffic to sites and it is completely reasonable to expect them to integrate vertically and drive that traffic to sites it owns." The acquisition may not indicate a trend, but it does make good business sense, said "MySpace's interest in Photobucket is less a general trend than it is a decent fit between what MySpace does -- gathering people -- and what Photobucket adds, namely, helping those people share pictures," he told TechNewsWorld. "Because Photobucket also brings in a few dozen million people that MySpace doesn't already have, it's even more valuable. Seems like a good but unique fit more than a harbinger of things to come." Big fish eating smaller fish is otherwise known as consolidation, and it happens as industries age, explained Parr. "The Web is definitely maturing," he said. "The number of users is growing more slowly and it is going to flatten out in the next five years. One of the things that happens in maturing markets is consolidation. We expect there to be more." Additionally, the FIM/Photobucket deal shows that -- despite their popularity -- interactive sites such as Photobucket are worth more to entities like Fox than they are as stand-alone companies, said Parr. "There is one thing MySpace and Fox have to be careful about," he suggested. "They have to continue to be open. In the long run, if they are not open and don't allow other sites to, say, provide widgets to customers, they might find that over time, their customers will migrate to other more open sites." Another issue the media moguls must face is monetization, McQuivey said. "Overall the message is that social computing is a powerful platform as long as it has a way to put advertisements in front of those people being gathered -- which YouTube still lacks, even this far post acquisition," he noted. "That's why the purchase prices have rationalized -- buyers are properly focused on valuing the people coming to the site more than the intangible value of the collective community."

The company also provided guidance for fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. The company said non-GAAP net income for the third quarter ended April 28, 2007 rose to $4.0 million, or $0.15 per share from $0.19 million or $0.01 per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2006. On average, 5 analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial expected the company to earn $0.16 per share for the quarter. Optium said net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was $3.4 million, or $0.13 per share compared to a net loss of $11.0 million or $4.73 loss per share for the same period in the previous year. Optium said net income for the third quarter of 2006 included a charge of $11.2 million toward acquired in-process R&D related to the acquisition of Engana Pty Limited, presently called Optium Australia. Income from operations for the quarter was $2.27 million compared to loss from operations of $11.06 million in the prior year period. Gross profit for the three-month period rose to $9.4 million from $9.93 million in the same quarter of the previous year. Optium said revenues for the three-month period rose 110% to$34.5 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 from $16.5 million in the corresponding period of the previous year. The company said net income for the nine-month period amounted to $10.04 million or $0.41 per share compared to a net loss of $9.82 million or $4.93 loss per share for the same period last year. Revenues for 2007 rose to $98.69 million from $46.49 million in the comparable period last year. Looking ahead, Optium said it expects fourth quarter non-GAAP net income to be between $0.08 and $0.11 per share on revenues of $34.5 to $37.5 million. Currently, Street analysts expect the company to earn $0.17 per share for the quarter. OPTM closed Wednesday's regular trading session at $15.69. Wyeth Reveals FDA Approval For TORISEL, An MTOR Inhibitor For Treatment Of Advanced Kidney Cancer - Update [WYE] 5/30/2007 11:57:14 PM Wednesday, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, a division of pharmaceutical and health care products company Wyeth (WYE), said that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved TORISEL for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Wyeth expects that TORISEL will be available to patients in July 2007. The Madison, New Jersey-based company said TORISEL is an mTOR inhibitor indicated for the treatment of advanced Renal cell carcinoma (RCC). TORISEL is the first targeted renal cancer therapy proven to extend median overall survival versus interferon- alpha, an active comparator, in this patient population. Renal cell carcinoma accounts for about 85% of kidney cancers. More than 40% of the patients are initially diagnosed with advanced disease. TORISEL is the only marketed cancer therapy that specifically inhibits the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) kinase, a key protein in cells that regulates cell proliferation, cell growth and cell survival. As part of a post marketing commitment Wyeth has agreed also to submit two completed study reports and data sets: one on a thorough QT prolongation study and one on an ongoing hepatic impairment study. Gary Hudes, M.D., Director, Genitourinary Malignancies Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, and lead investigator of the phase 3 trial of TORISEL in advanced RCC said, "Temsirolimus is the first drug to demonstrate a significant increase in overall survival for patients with the most aggressive form of kidney cancer, providing us with a new and much needed option for treatment." In a three-arm, phase 3 clinical trial of 626 patients with advanced RCC and poor prognosis who had received no prior systemic therapy, TORISEL significantly increased median overall survival by 49% compared to interferon-alpha. TORISEL also was associated with a statistically significant improvement over interferon-alpha in the secondary endpoint of progression-free survival. The combination of TORISEL and interferon-alpha did not result in a significant increase in overall survival when compared with interferon-alpha alone. Wyeth said it continues to study TORISEL in a phase 3 trial of patients with mantle cell lymphoma, and the company is pursuing several additional studies in RCC. Additional oncology trials with TORISEL are being conducted through a cooperative research and development agreement with the National Cancer Institute in several other tumor types. WYE closed Wednesday's regular trading session at $57.50. After hours WYE rose $0.05 or 0.09% and traded at $57.55.

Faulty fax, mistaken as threat, prompts evacuation of stores By John C. Drake, Globe Staff | ASHLAND -- In a scene reminiscent of the Cartoon Network bomb scare that paralyzed the Boston area in January, police shut down a strip mall yesterday in this small western suburb after employees at a branch mistook a botched fax for a bomb threat. Frustrated shop owners said the branch overreacted to the strange fax, which turned out to be an in-house marketing document sent by the bank's corporate office. "The women at the bank should have handled it a little better," said Nick Markos, owner of Townhouse Pizza and Roast Beef, who estimated that he had lost $1,000 to $1,200 because of the lunch-hour evacuation. "She blew it all out of proportion, and all of us business owners had to pay for it." A day-care center with about 30 children and more than a dozen small businesses in Ledgemere Plaza on Eliot Street were evacuated for about three hours after bank branch managers received a fax with images of a crude timer and a hand lighting a bomb, Ashland police Chief Scott Rohmer said. Bank employees told police a suspicious package had arrived around the same time, elevating their fears. Bank security personnel later determined that a fax machine at the corporate office left off the text alerting employees to Small Business Commitment Week in June, including the words, "The Countdown Begins," above the bomb. "It was not a communication that was ever meant to be distributed to customers or anyone externally, and the fax machine malfunctioned, so when it came out of the fax machine, it looked suspicious," Bank of America spokesman Ernesto Anguilla said. Anguilla said that branches across the Northeast received the distorted fax and that while other branches also evacuated, none saw law enforcement response as extensive as in Ashland. He would not say how many branches received the fax or how many had been evacuated. "In Ashland, the situation was compounded by the fact that we had a suspicious package on the scene, as well," Anguilla said. Added Rohmer, "I think it was reasonable to assume there was a threat, based on what they saw on the fax." Rohmer said that town officials may ask Bank of America to reimburse the town for the cost of the response, which included more than a dozen town officers and firefighters, personnel from neighboring towns, a State Police bomb squad, and police dogs. Anguilla would not comment on whether the bank would be willing to pay for the emergency response. A reimbursement would add to the similarities to the Cartoon Network scare in January. The guerrilla marketing campaign, in which two artists hung 40 battery-powered light screens around Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville, shut down major streets and subways as bomb squads rushed to remove the suspicious-looking devices. Turner Broadcasting System, Cartoon Network's parent company, reimbursed local, state, and federal agencies and governments $1 million for the cost of the response and paid an additional $1 million in goodwill cash. Dawn Frazier, a Holliston resident and owner of the Paul Albert Salon and Spa in the shopping plaza, said she immediately thought of that scare when she learned why she had to evacuate her busy shop. "It was very disruptive," she said. Cristina Valas, owner of The Family Pet Hospital, said it was fortunate that the hospital was not in the middle of a surgery when police ordered the evacuation. They were directed to leave three cats, including one recovering from dental surgery, inside. "I wouldn't have taken it as a bomb threat, personally," said veterinary technician Amy Tatreau. "However, you have to, I guess, treat things seriously these days." John C. Drake can be reached at &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

The $75 million (&#8364;56 million) cash acquisition gives eBay access to about 2.3 million people who have filled out profiles at StumbleUpon, founded in 2001 by three Canadian software engineers in Calgary. The venture capital-funded company, which recently relocated to San Francisco, is considered a pioneer of the so-called "Web 3.0" niche. The term refers to technology that pairs general Internet search capability with a user&#039;s personal data and aggregated community data, theoretically delivering more relevant results than a standard search engine such as Google Inc. For example, a StumbleUpon search for "cars" could generate a list of Web pages that factor in a user&#039;s income, age, gender, home address, current vehicles owned and other demographic data submitted. The search results would also include sites ranked favorably by other StumbleUpon members with similar interests and background. By contrast, a straight Google search delivers 357 million Web pages ranging from the popular Hollywood movie "Cars" to advertisements for used car dealers and newspaper classified sections. US economy grows by just 0.6 percent in the first quarter Wachovia buys A.G. Edwards for $6.8 billion . Deutsche Telekom executive who once worked at Siemens to leave company StumbleUpon is free for users and generates revenue through advertising, though the company doesn&#039;t disclose financial information. Members who pay an annual fee bypass advertisements completely. Michael Buhr, senior director at San Jose-based eBay, will serve as general manager of StumbleUpon. StumbleUpons founders and managers will become eBay employees. "StumbleUpon is a great fit within our goal of pioneering new communities based on commerce and sustained by trust," Buhr said. The acquisition is not expected to change eBay&#039;s latest financial guidance. The company expects to report second-quarter profit of 31 cents to 33 cents per share on sales in the range of $1.75 billion (&#8364;1.3 billion) to $1.8 billion (&#8364;1.34 billion). For the full year, eBay expects profit of $1.30 (&#8364;.97) to $1.34 (&#8364;1) per share on sales of $7.2 billion (&#8364;5.37 billion) to $7.45 billion (&#8364;5.55 billion). The 12-year-old e-commerce powerhouse had $3.5 billion (&#8364;2.6 billion) in cash last month and has been aggressively acquiring smaller companies to compete against rivals ranging from Google to Amazon.com. EBay, which already owns Internet phone service Skype and portals such as Shopping.com and Rent.com, completed the buyout of online ticket reseller StubHub for $310 million (&#8364;231 million) earlier this year.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/media/31photo.html&cid A Unit of News Corp. Agrees to Buy Photobucket and Flektor - New York Times A Unit of News Corp. Agrees to Buy Photobucket and Flektor Sign In to E-Mail or Save This By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Published: May 31, 2007 Fox Interactive Media, a unit of the , has agreed to acquire the photo-storage site Photobucket, just weeks after a public spat in which the popular networking site MySpace partly blocked content from Photobucket. MySpace, which is also owned by the News Corporation, lifted the block after about two weeks, but both sides have been silent on the details of their peacemaking. Separately, Fox also agreed to buy Flektor Inc., which offers Web-based tools for creating slide shows, recombined videos and other interactive presentations. Financial terms of the two deals were not disclosed. MySpace users often embed third-party photos, video and other material in their personal profile pages, and sites like Photobucket and YouTube, ’s video-sharing site, make that easy by providing the programming code to cut and paste into MySpace pages. The practice has made Photobucket one of the leading sites on the Internet, even though relatively few users access content directly through its home page. MySpace blocked Photobucket in April, after complaining that the hosting service had been encouraging users to incorporate an ad-supported slide show into their MySpace profiles. MySpace said the slide show violated its policies banning unauthorized commercial activity. Photobucket’s chief executive, Alex Welch, responded by accusing MySpace of limiting free expression and treating users as a commodity. He was more conciliatory two weeks later, saying the two had “established open lines of communication and procedures,” but he made no mention of negotiations over a sale of his company.

The bank and the entire strip mall on Elliot Street, which includes a day-care center, was evacuated at about 11 a.m. All of the children were taken to Warren Elementary School to meet their parents. The businesses were reopened after officials found out that the fax was sent by a marketing group for a promotion to kick off a special offer from the bank. "Fortunately, the incident was a false alarm. A document, which was an internal communication sent from a malfunctioning fax machine, combined with a suspicious package brought into the Ashland banking center, caused some concern," Bank of America said in a statement. The bank said that the fax was meant for Bank of America employees and was intended for internal purposes for an upcoming small business promotion. Copyright 2007 by TheBostonChannel.com.

The move, along with lower general and administrative expenses, will help save an additional $600 million a year starting in 2008, Motorola said today in a statement. The company said it expects costs of $300 million, or 8 cents a share, in the remainder of this year tied to the latest cuts. The reductions represent about 6 percent of Motorola&#39;s total workforce at the end of 2006, and come on top of 3,500 job cuts announced in January. Schaumburg, Illinois-based Motorola posted its first loss in almost three years in the first quarter as competitors Nokia Oyj and Samsung Electronics Co. won market share with new devices. ``They&#39;re doing the right things,&#39;&#39; said William Choi, a Jefferies & Co. analyst in New York who rates the shares ``hold&#39;&#39; and doesn&#39;t own them. ``It doesn&#39;t solve the main problem they currently have, which is to strengthen their portfolio of handset products.&#39;&#39; Shares of Motorola rose 17 cents to $18.45 in extended trading. They slipped 2 cents to $18.28 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading and have lost 11 percent this year. Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland, has gained 30 percent, and Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung has declined 13 percent. Chief Executive Officer Ed Zander has come under fire from investors for not moving quickly enough to revive the mobile- phone business. He is rolling out new products and focusing on profit, instead of chopping prices to win back market share. ``Long-term, sustainable profitability is -- and always has been -- Motorola&#39;s top priority,&#39;&#39; Chief Financial Officer Tom Meredith said in the statement. Motorola said the January firings, which mainly affected middle managers, will be completed on schedule by June 30. The company, which had 66,000 workers at the end of 2006, plans to save $400 million a year with the original cuts. The company said separately a count of shareholder votes confirmed that billionaire investor Carl Icahn failed to win a seat on the board. Icahn, who criticized management, won 717.1 million votes, compared with 931.7 million for John White, who has been on Motorola&#39;s board since 1995. A non-binding proposal to give shareholders a vote on executive pay, which the board had opposed, won 51.8 percent of votes, Motorola said. The company&#39;s profit margins shrank last year amid price- cutting to make up for a lack of successful products to replace its best-selling Razr phone, which is more than two years old. The loss at the handset unit was $231 million excluding some costs last quarter. Revenue from phones fell 15 percent to $5.4 billion as sales slipped in emerging markets and in Europe. In the first quarter, Zander stopped lowering prices to preserve profit. The strategy backfired as Motorola lost sales, partly because its phones weren&#39;t competitive, according to Boston-based researcher Strategy Analytics Ltd. The company on May 15 said it will start selling a successor to the Razr in July in a bid to fuel demand. While the Razr2 and other products unveiled this quarter will help Motorola return to profit, they aren&#39;t enough to stem further market share losses in the second half of the year, according to analysts including Piper Jaffray & Co.&#39;s T. Michael Walkley. The market share gap between Nokia and Motorola widened to its largest in more than three years in the first quarter, Strategy Analytics said. Motorola&#39;s market share slid to 18 percent, while Nokia&#39;s share widened to 36.2 percent. Nokia on May 14 said its market share will increase in the second quarter.

May 30 2007: 7:19 PM EDT NEW YORK (Reuters) -- Federal prosecutors Wednesday charged two current and two former partners of accounting firm Ernst & Young with tax fraud conspiracy arising out of the sale of tax shelters. The defendants, who pleaded not guilty at U.S. District court in Manhattan, are accused of creating and marketing tax shelters at the "Big Four" accounting firm from 1998 through 2004 based on fraudulent scenarios that allowed wealthy individuals to reduce the federal taxes they would have to pay. Despite 'reform,' tax dollars are still spent on secret earmarks even Congress members can't find. CNN's Drew Griffin reports. (May 25) The indictment comes after years of investigations into the sale of aggressive tax shelter strategies. Sixteen former partners at rival "Big Four" firm KPMG are also facing trial in September. GM gets SEC accounting info request The four men accused Wednesday include Robert Coplan, former National Director of Ernst & Young's Center for Family Wealth Planning; Martin Nissenbaum, the firm's former national director of Personal Income Tax and Retirement Planning; former Ernst & Young partner Richard Shapiro and Brian Vaughn, a former senior manager at the firm. A lawyer for Shapiro, John Tigue, said his client has cooperated with the government's inquiry for the last five years. "He intends to vigorously defend himself," Tigue said in a statement. At a hearing before U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein, Copland, Shapiro and Nissenbaum were released on $1 million bail with travel restrictions, while Vaughn was released on $300,000 bail with travel restrictions. If convicted of the charges, Coplan, 54, could face 18 years in prison; Nissenbaum, 51, could serve as many as 13 years, while Shapiro, 58, and Vaughn, 39, could each face 10. Defense lawyers maintained their clients were innocent. "We have provided them (the U.S. attorney's office) over the past year with evidence that Mr. Nissenbaum did not engage in any unlawful activity," Brian Linder, an attorney for Nissenbaum said in a statement. Vaughn's attorney, Peter Barrett, said his client "looks forward to trial in this case, to his acquittal, and complete exoneration of all of these allegations." A lawyer for Coplan would not comment. Prosecutors allege the four schemed to defraud U.S. tax authorities by deceiving the the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about tax shelters marketed to clients with incomes higher than $10 million or $20 million. The indictment also charges that Coplan, Nissenbaum and Shapiro used tax shelters in 2000 to evade their own taxes and arranged for eight other Ernst & Young partners to participate, evading $3.7 million in taxes. Ernst & Young was not named in the suit, suggesting a change in government strategy since the conviction of now-defunct accounting firm Arthur Andersen was overturned by the Supreme Court, a legal expert said. "The lesson the government has learned is to go for a precision strike against individuals," said Anthony Sabino, a law professor at St. John's University's Tobin College of Business. "You can't prove the whole firm is guilty." The attempted prosecution of the firm also lengthened the KPMG tax shelter case, Sabino said. In 2005, KPMG agreed to pay $456 million, accept an outside monitor and admit to wrongdoing to resolve a federal investigation into questionable tax shelters it sold to wealthy individuals. But the settlement with the firm resulted in difficulties about who would pay the legal fees of KPMG's former partners in that case. Ernst & Young said it has made changes to its tax practice. "The individuals who were indicted are two former partners and two partners who have been on administrative leave," Ernst & Young spokesman Charles Perkins said in a statement. "They were part of a small group within the firm, disbanded years ago ... Ernst & Young has cooperated with the government from the beginning of its investigation, and we will continue to do so." In July 2003, Ernst & Young agreed to pay $15 million to the IRS to end an investigation of tax shelter marketing.

According to the indictment unsealed Wednesday, the defendants and their co-conspirators concocted and marketed tax shelter transactions based on false and fraudulent factual scenarios to be used by wealthy individuals with taxable income generally in excess of $10 or $20 million to eliminate or reduce the taxes they would have to pay the IRS. The indictment charges four individuals in 8 separate counts, including conspiracy to defraud the IRS, tax evasion, making false statements to the IRS, and impeding and impairing the lawful functioning of the IRS. All four individuals worked in a group set up by E&#038;Y in 1998 to develop tax shelters, which was first named VIPER (Value Ideas Produce ExtraordinaryResults), and later renamed SISG (Strategic Individual SolutionsGroup) The four individuals named in the indictment are: Robert Coplan, 54, of Plano, Texas, a former E&#038;Y tax partner who was the leader of the VIPER/SISG group, and the former national director of E&#038;Yâ€™s Center for Wealth Planning. Â Coplan, a lawyer, was at one time a branch chief in the IRSâ€™ Legislation and Regulations Division. Martin Nissenbaum, 51, of Brooklyn, Â an E&#038;Y partner who was a member of the VIPER/SISG group, and the national director of E&#038;Y&#8217;s Personal Income Tax and Retirement Planning practice. NIssenbaum is also a lawyer. Richard Shapiro, 58, of Rye Brook, Â who was a member of the VIPER/SISG group, and an E&#038;Y tax partner. Shapiro is also a lawyer. Brian Vaughn, 39, of Calhoun, Louisiana a former member of the VIPER/SISG group, and a former E&#038;Y tax partner, who is a CPA. As alleged in the indictment, from 1998 through 2004, the four defendants and others participated in a scheme to defraud the IRS by designing, marketing, implementing and defending fraudulent tax shelters. The conspirators sought to deceive the IRS about the bona fides of those shelters and the circumstances under which the shelters were marketed and sold to clients, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors say the defendants and their co-conspirators understood that if the IRS were to detect their clients&#8217; use of these tax shelters, and learn the true facts and circumstances surrounding the design, marketing and implementation of the shelters, the IRS would aggressively challenge the claimed tax benefits. In tha tevent, the IRS would seek to collect the unpaid taxes plus interest, and might also seek to impose substantial penalties upon the clients. Accordingly, the conspirators undertook to prevent the IRS from detecting their clients&#8217; use of these shelters; understanding how the transactions operated to produce the tax results reported by the clients; learning that the shelters were marketed as cookie-cutter products that would eliminate, reduce or defer large tax liabilities; learning that the clients were not seeking profit-making investment opportunities, but were instead seeking huge tax benefits; and learning that, from the outset, all the clients intended to complete a pre-planned series of steps that had been designed by the conspirators to lead to the specific tax benefits sought by the clients. In order to maximize the appearance that the tax shelters were investments undertaken to generate profits, and to minimize the likelihood that the IRS would learn the transactions were actually designed to create tax losses and deductions, the defendants and their co-conspirators allegedly created and in creating transactional documents and other materials containing false and fraudulent descriptions of the clients&#8217; motivations for entering into the transactions, and their motivations for taking the various steps that would yield the tax benefits. The conspirators also carefully protected internal documents and promotional materials that set forth the tax benefits and pricing schedules of the various shelters against disclosure to the IRS. Prosecutors say that in order to encourage clients to participate in the shelters, and to shield the clients from substantial penalties that could be imposed if the IRS disallowed the claimed tax benefits, the defendants allegedly worked with law firms to provide E&#038;Y&#8217;s clients with opinion letters that claimed the tax shelter losses or deductions would &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; survive IRS challenge, or &#8220;should&#8221; survive IRS challenge. However, the defendants allegedly knew those opinions were based upon false and fraudulent statements, and omitted material facts. As described in the conspiracy charge, by helping their clients obtain false and fraudulent opinion letters, with the understanding and intent that those opinion letters would be presented to the IRS if and when the clients were audited, the defendants sought to undermine theability of the IRS to ascertain the clients&#8217; tax liabilities and determine whether penalties should be imposed. The indictment alleges that the defendants and their co-conspirators undertook these actions so that E&#038;Y could participate in the highly lucrative tax shelter market in which other accounting firms were already participating; so that E&#038;Y could prevent its high-net-worth clients from taking their business (including, potentially, the highly prized audit business associated with some of these individuals) to its competitors; so that E&#038;Yâ€™s Personal Financial Counseling practice, a business unit that was not a substantial contributor to the firm&#8217;s revenues, could grow and prosper within the firm; and so the individual defendants could enhance their own opportunities for professional recognition, advancement, job security, and remuneration. Among the alleged fraudulent tax shelter transactions designed, marketed, and implemented by the defendants and theirco-conspirators were CDS (&#8221;Contingent Deferred Swap&#8221;); COBRA(&#8221;Currency Options Bring Reward Alternatives&#8221;); CDS Add-On; andPICO (&#8221;Personal Investment Corporation&#8221;). The iIndictment also charges defendant Robert Coplan with corruptly endeavoring to impede the due administration of the Internal Revenue laws by instructing E&#038;Y individuals to destroy documents related to the COBRA transaction when he knew of a pending IRS audit of the transaction. The Indictment charges defendants Coplan and Brian Vaughn with making false statements to the IRS in connection with an examination by the IRS of whether E&#038;Y had complied with various legal requirements applicable to the firm&#8217;s tax shelter activities. The indictment further charges defendants Coplan, Nissenbaum and Shapiro with implementing a tax shelter in 2000 to evade their own taxes, and with arranging for eight of their E&#038;Y partners to participate in the tax shelter transaction with them. Use of that tax shelter enabled the group of 11 E&#038;Y partners to eliminate a total of approximately $3.7 million in taxes. The indictment also charges Nissenbaum with corruptly obstructing the due administration of the Internal Revenue laws by providing false and misleading statements to the IRS on behalf of himself and 10 other E&#038;Y partners in connection with an audit of the 2000 tax returns of all 11 participants in the transaction.Â  5-30-07 Add this post to COPYRIGHT 2007 - NORTH COUNTRY GAZETTE All rights reserved.

The deal announced Wednesday will give MySpace and sister sites under News Corp.'s Fox Interactive Media access to Photobucket Inc.'s photo and video technologies, while Photobucket gets Fox's resources to accelerate development of its tools. Peter Levinsohn, president of Fox Interactive, said Photobucket also would be able to incorporate advanced slideshow generators and other editing tools from Flektor Inc., which Fox also announced Wednesday it bought. "Together, they represent a powerful combination and we are thrilled for them to join our network," Levinsohn said. Financial terms of the two deals were not disclosed. But three people familiar with the Photobucket deal, citing anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the price, said Fox was paying about $300 million for Photobucket, about half of the $580 million News Corp. paid in 2005 to buy MySpace. The Photobucket deal comes just weeks after a public spat in which MySpace partially blocked content from Photobucket. It was announced the same day CBS Corp. said it purchased global online social network Last.fm for $280 million in cash in a move to attract younger viewers and listeners across its businesses. MySpace offers a mix of messaging tools to encourage its youth-oriented visitors to expand their circles of friends. Central to the site are personal profile pages where users can post photos and video clips, blast messages to friends and have visitors leave comments. MySpace users often embed material from outside sites like Photobucket and Google Inc.'s YouTube, both of which make that easy by providing the programming code to cut and paste into MySpace profile pages. The practice has made Photobucket one of the leading sites on the Internet, even though relatively few access content directly through its home page. Under the deal, Photobucket would remain a standalone operation within Fox, and users of rival social-networking sites such as Facebook could continue to incorporate Photobucket content in their profiles. For now, Photobucket will continue to offer basic services for free, with a fee for more storage and other features. Most noticeable for users will be the acceleration of new editing tools, such as cropping and red-eye removal, Photobucket Chief Executive Alex Welch said. With the resources of a larger company, he said, Photobucket won't be spending much of its time "in a firefighting mode." According to Nielsen/NetRatings, the acquisition isn't likely to boost MySpace's audience given the significant overlap already between the two. MySpace alone had 56 million U.S. unique visitors in March, while Photobucket had 15 million. The combined audience would have been 58 million had the combination been in effect then. But Levinsohn said users don't hang out at two places at once, so the combination still would mean more time spent on Fox properties overall. And it could give Fox a foothold on sites run by its rivals, especially as Photobucket makes more sponsorship deals of the type that led to a block by MySpace in April. Photobucket had encouraged users to build slideshows promoting Sony Corp.'s "Spider-Man 3," which MySpace considered a violation of policies banning unauthorized commercial activities. The block was mysteriously lifted after about two weeks, but both sides had been silent on the details of their peacemaking. Executives from Fox and Photobucket said Wednesday that the acquisition talks were unrelated to that dispute. Fox's agreements to purchase Photobucket and Flektor represent the latest acquisitions of startups by larger Internet companies. In November, Google bought video-sharing site YouTube for $1.76 billion. The Flektor deal closed Tuesday, while the Photobucket acquisition was signed Tuesday and should close next month. Flektor's deal represents a coup for that site, which has been open to the public for only a month. Flektor, like Photobucket, will remain a standalone site, but Fox already has concrete plans to incorporate into MySpace its Web-based tools for creating slideshows, video mash-ups and other interactive presentations. Jason Rubin, Flektor's co-founder, said the deal lets the site grow its audience more quickly than it can alone. So far, he said, the site has fewer than 40,000 users, nearly all through word of mouth. Shares in News Corp. rose 25 cents, or 1 percent, to $23.97 Wednesday.

Before today’s numbers were released, it was clear the economy was downshifting from the rapid 5.6 percent expansion of the first quarter last year. But the new data reinforced how significant the slowdown has been. Growth advanced just 0.6 percent, compared with an initial estimate of 1.3 percent. It was the slowest rate recorded since the fourth quarter of 2002. The chief reasons for the revisions were adjustments to the estimates of imports and business inventories. Imports, which subtract from the gross domestic product, were stronger than the government first thought. At the same time, businesses cut production and accumulated smaller inventory stockpiles. Despite the adjustments to the growth figures, inflation in the first quarter was essentially unrevised. Prices excluding food and energy, a measure preferred by the Federal Reserve, advanced by 2.2 percent in the first quarter, still above what the central bank has said it considers acceptable. But there were some revisions to the numbers that economists said they found to be encouraging. Consumer spending, the staple of economic growth for the last decade, was revised higher. It advanced 4.4 percent in the first quarter, compared with an initial estimate of 3.8 percent. And the drag from the collapse in residential real estate was slightly less than the government first reported. Most economists agree that the first quarter was probably a low point for the last several years, and they expect the economy has regained some strength in the second quarter. Although consumer spending has probably slowed since the first quarter and the correction in the housing market is ongoing, economists expect demand from overseas to help businesses in the United States. “There are reasons to expect G.D.P. growth to improve,” said Richard Moody, chief economist with Mission Residential, a real estate investment firm in Austin, Texas.

The drug, Torisel, is made by Wyeth and is the third new kidney cancer drug approved since December 2005. The FDA had been expected to approve Torisel in April, but sought additional information from the company and pushed the expected approval date to July. Wyeth said the drug will be available in July.

Tillerson, continuing the conciliatory approach he undertook a year ago upon succeeding the combative Lee Raymond, patiently tried to convince environmental and social activists that Exxon Mobil is concerned about and is taking steps to address the possibility that human and industrial activity are causing global temperatures to rise. "We don't have a difference of views that it's an important issue," Tillerson said. "We have differences about what we know and what we don't know." A sizable group of activists critical of the company's environmental policies were among the 1,000 or so shareholders who turned out for the three-hour meeting at the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in downtown Dallas. One after another, critics took the microphone to criticize Exxon Mobil's past policies and support of groups that question the validity and the science behind the claims that global warming is largely caused by human consumption of fossil fuels. Framing their arguments in management terms, activists charged that Exxon Mobil's efforts have hurt the company's image and threatened to undermine its long-term financial viability. Andrew Logan of the Investor Network on Climate Risk pointedly asked why Exxon Mobil "has put so much effort into making itself public enemy Number 1 in terms of the global-warming debate" by openly opposing calls for the U.S. and foreign governments to make significant environmental policy changes. "You've sacrificed the company's reputation by taking a position that, it seems to me, is to the benefit of no one," Logan said. Tillerson, as he did repeatedly throughout the meeting, responded in measured tones. "We never set out to make the company public enemy Number 1," Tillerson said. Exxon's differences with global-warming activists, he said, have always been over the degree of certainty involved in the science of climate change. "What I find perplexing," Tillerson said, "is why people feel so threatened because we want to have a discussion" about the scientific issues "and what is known and what is not known." Even under Raymond, Tillerson said, Exxon Mobil has sought to support organizations that back work on the science of global warming and cutting carbon-dioxide emissions. Company scientists and engineers have played a role in the efforts of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has authored leading studies on climate change. Other critics, saying Exxon Mobil should seek to be a broad-based energy company, called for it to take a more active role and devote a share of its research and development funds and expertise in the development of alternative fuels rather than continue investing almost entirely in oil and gas production. "We do not oppose the development of alternatives to fossil fuels," Tillerson said, attempting to cool the discussion. But Exxon Mobil's expertise has made it the industry leader in oil and gas production and, Tillerson said, estimates of the world's rising energy requirements for the next 25 years show that the majority will still come from fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal. Tillerson's charm offensive may not be winning many converts among the ranks of environmental and social activists, but it may be lessening the tension somewhat. None of the 15 shareholder proposals, all opposed by management, was approved. But several gained more than 40 percent of the votes cast, a significant advance against the management opposition. A year ago, for the first time in memory, a management-opposed measure was approved. One of the rejected proposals called for the company to adopt specific goals for reducing its own carbon-dioxide emissions to help counter global warming. It received a 31 percent favorable vote. The proposal gaining the most support, 47.8 percent, would have amended the company's bylaws to allow shareholders representing 10 percent of the company's stock to call a special shareholders meeting. The com- pany said such a provision now exists, provided shareholders can show good cause in court to call such a meeting. Tillerson, at the conclusion of the meeting, extended an olive branch to the dissidents among the Exxon Mobil shareholders. "I really do appreciate all of your comments today and the respectful way they were presented." DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDER INITIATIVES Shareholders overwhelmingly approved the election of all Exxon Mobil's nominated directors. Economist Michael Boskin of the free-market oriented Hoover Institution at Stanford University received the least support, 93 percent of the vote. New director Steve Reinemund, former chairman and CEO of PepsiCo, received a 98 percent favorable vote. 7.8 percent favored a proposal to allow shareholders representing 10 percent of the company's stock to call a special shareholders meeting. The company said such a provision now exists, provided shareholders can show good cause in court. 7.2 percent supported a resolution asking the Exxon Mobil board to adopt a bylaw allowing the company to recoup unearned bonuses or other incentive payments to senior executives. 1.2 percent voted for a proposal that would have allowed shareholders to vote on an advisory resolution approving the pay and other compensation of senior company executives. 1 percent voted for the company to adopt specific goals for reducing its own carbon-dioxide emissions to help counter global warming.

The cellphone maker Motorola said it would cut another 4,000 jobs as part of a plan to improve sagging financial and operational results. The latest round of cuts means Motorola, the world&#039;s No. 2 handset maker, has announced plans to eliminate more than 10 percent of its work force since the start of 2007, when it became clear that two years of strong momentum behind its popular Razr phone had collapsed. The company is already eliminating 3,500 jobs as part of a two-year cost-cutting plan to save $400 million. Those layoffs, announced in January, are to be completed by June 30. Motorola said Wednesday that it would save another $600 million in 2008 by cutting 4,000 more workers, prioritizing investments and putting controls on discretionary spending and general and administrative expenses. US economy grows by just 0.6 percent in the first quarter Wachovia buys A.G. Edwards for $6.8 billion . Deutsche Telekom executive who once worked at Siemens to leave company The company did not specify where the new cuts would be made. A spokeswoman, Jennifer Weyrauch, said they would be achieved through a mixture of attrition and layoffs. The company expects to take a restructuring charge of $300 million, or 8 cents per share, in 2007, from severance and related expenses from staff cuts. Tom Meredith, Motorola&#039;s chief financial executive, said the move was an "update to the commitment" the company had made "to drive out additional costs, and a continuation of the plan we announced in January." Motorola&#039;s work force, which stood at 150,000 people worldwide as recently as 2000, had declined to 66,000 at the beginning of the year. Weyrauch said the company, which has acquired several smaller firms in recent months, also is continuing to hire. It remains to be seen whether it can come up with a hit successor to the Razr, the success of which has been eroded by declining sale prices and competitors&#039; new phones. Wall Street appeared to modestly approve of the latest cuts. Motorola shares rose 12 cents in extended-hours trading after closing the regular session down 2 cents at $18.28. "From a cost-cutting perspective, these are steps in the right direction for the long term," said John Slack, a Morningstar analyst. "But the big issue to underscore is that products in the market are the key, and that is a slow ship to turn." Motorola began to cut back in January in an effort to recover from a series of miscues that caused it to lose about a third of its market value since October. It had ridden the Razr to significant gains in the world cellphone market for two years, closing the gap on its rival Nokia. But its strategy of cutting prices sharply to sell more units backfired, hammering its profit margins. Exacerbating its troubles, Ron Garriques departed abruptly in February as head of the cellphone unit. This spring, the company posted its first quarterly loss since 2004 and executives indicated that its efforts had not gone far enough. Motorola has already warned that its results from the April-June quarter will not be good.

Expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year fell to the lowest since last July as the National Association for Purchasing Management-Chicago report indicated the economy is rebounding from a first-quarter slowdown. U.S. equities extended an advance that yesterday pushed the Standard & Poor&#39;s 500 Index to a record. ``I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see people change their minds and raise the probability of the Fed hiking,&#39;&#39; said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, co-head of U.S. fixed-income strategy in New York at Barclays Capital, one of the 21 primary dealers that underwrite the U.S. government&#39;s debt. ``Yields will continue to move higher.&#39;&#39; The 10-year note&#39;s yield, which moves inversely to its price, rose more than 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.9022 percent at 11:33 a.m. in New York, according to bond broker Cantor Fitzgerald LP. Earlier it touched 4.917 percent, the highest since Aug. 16. Until today, the highest level of the year was 4.902 percent on Jan. 26. The price of 4 1/2 percent notes maturing in May 2017 fell 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000 face amount, to 96 27/32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose from a record, and the Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets Index increased the most since March, approaching its May 22 record. ``Overlap the S&P and the 10-year contract, and you&#39;d see a very good correlation,&#39;&#39; said Jeffry Feigenwinter, head of U.S. Treasury trading at primary dealer BNP Paribas Securities Corp. in New York. ``Everybody thinks the market&#39;s cheap, but it&#39;s really still expensive&#39;&#39; relative to the overnight lending rate set by the Fed. The NAPM-Chicago&#39;s business barometer rose to 61.7 in May from 52.9 in April. Readings greater than 50 signal expansion. The median forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg was for a smaller increase to 54.0. ``We&#39;ll have to see if this follows through with the ISM number tomorrow,&#39;&#39; said Theodore Ake, head of U.S. government bond trading in New York at primary dealer Mizuho Securities USA Inc. He referred to the Institute for Supply Management&#39;s manufacturing index. The median forecast was for a decline to 54.0 from 54.7 in April. On a comparable increase in that gauge, ``the market&#39;s going to have to take out the fact that the next move from the Fed is an ease, and that any kind of ease in 2007 is out of the question,&#39;&#39; Ake said. Yields on Eurodollar futures expiring in December rose to the highest since July as traders pared bets on interest-rate cuts by the Fed. The yields forecast the interest rate on three- month bank deposits, which closely tracks the Fed&#39;s target for the overnight lending rate between banks. The three-month deposit rate, also known as Libor, is 5.36 percent. The federal funds target is 5.25 percent. The December Eurodollar futures yield rose 3 basis points to 5.285 percent, the highest since July 25. The market had little reaction to a government report showing the U.S. economy in the first quarter expanded at a slower pace than originally estimated. Gross domestic product grew at a rate of 0.6 percent, compared with an initial estimate of 1.3 percent, the Commerce Department said. The median forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg was for a revision to 0.8 percent. While the pace of GDP growth was the weakest in more than four years, reports have shown that business spending has improved in the second quarter. Minutes of Fed policy makers&#39; most recent meeting, released yesterday, showed they still expect growth to accelerate this year and are primarily concerned about inflation. A Labor Department report released at the same time as the GDP report showed new claims for state unemployment insurance benefits last week fell below their average for all of last year, pointing to strength in the labor market. The department&#39;s monthly employment report for May is forecast to show job creation accelerated. First-time claims for state jobless benefits fell to 310,000 for the week ended May 26, from a revised 314,000 during the prior period. Last year&#39;s average was 313,000. Treasuries may benefit later today from the monthly rebalancing of bond indexes to include securities issued during the month. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., whose U.S. investment-grade bond indexes are used as benchmarks by managers of $2.5 trillion, estimated the duration of its U.S. Treasury Index will increase by 0.22 years when the index is rebalanced, the most since August 2002. Duration measures price sensitivity to changes in yield, and is partly a function of maturity. Some portfolio managers buy bonds around the time of a rebalancing that causes the index&#39;s duration to lengthen. The so- called index extensions in February, May, August and November are larger than in other months because 10-year notes and 30-year bonds are sold then.

Based in Englewood, Colo., Jeppesen is the world's largest provider of flight information services, such as the navigation charts that pilots use. It produces more than 2 billion such charts a year. The Boeing Co. acquired Jeppesen in August 2000 as part of its strategy to expand in the aviation services business, which Boeing estimated at the time would generate more than $2.6 trillion over the next two decades. The $1.5 billion in cash Boeing paid for the company was about six times Jeppesen's 1999 revenue of $235 million. Boeing has continued to grow Jeppesen, but it does not break out that revenue separately from overall sales in commercial airplanes. In its bid to acquire Jeppesen from the Tribune Co., Boeing had to beat out 10 other competitors. The media giant shed Jeppesen to help pay off debt after its purchase of the Los Angeles Times. When Boeing acquired Jeppesen, then-Boeing Chairman and Chief Executive Phil Condit had this to say: "This really is the glue to providing a whole set of information services. In the long run, we are trying to buy a business that can continue to grow." Jeppesen has since provided Boeing with an important and consistent revenue stream, according to industry analysts, although the amount is probably tiny compared with the more than $40 billion in annual sales generated by Boeing's jetliner business.

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070531.RMACKENZIE31/TPStory/Business&cid globeandmail.com: Exxon warns it will shelve Mackenzie pipe without subsidy Letters to the Editor Exxon warns it will shelve Mackenzie pipe without subsidy Oil giant says project isn't viable without federal assistance GLOBAL ENERGY REPORTER, With files from Reuters , one of the world's biggest oil companies, has turned up the heat on the Canadian government, saying the company will shelve the long-delayed Mackenzie Valley pipeline project unless it can get significant taxpayers' assistance for it. Rex Tillerson, Exxon's chief executive officer, told reporters at the company's annual meeting in Dallas yesterday that the $16.2-billion price tag for the 1,200-kilometre natural gas pipeline means that it is not viable without sizable federal aid. &#34;We are now in a situation where it's not economic at current costs,&#34; Mr. Tillerson said, noting the tremendous inflation that has plagued oil field construction projects. He said it is not clear if the federal government will come forward with a package of royalty and tax breaks large enough to provide the project sponsors with a decent rate of return. Print Edition - Section Front &#34;It may just be that the project is going to have to wait for a different cost environment,&#34; he said. The pipeline would carry up to 1.9 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from the Canadian Arctic to Alberta, and is seen as a critical piece of infrastructure in opening the North to resource development. Exxon owns 69.6 per cent of of Calgary, which is leading the project, currently under review by the National Energy Board. Earlier this year, Imperial announced that the projected cost for the Mackenzie Valley pipeline had ballooned to $16.2-billion from $7.5-billion, and that the partners would require &#34;an appropriate fiscal framework&#34; from the government to allow it to go ahead. Since then, the company and the federal government have been in discussions, although industry insiders believe Imperial is asking far more than Ottawa is prepared to give. Imperial spokesman Pius Rolheiser said yesterday that the company remains committed to the pipeline construction and continues to negotiate with northern native groups and the government as it pursues regulatory approval. &#34;Yes, it's economically challenged, yes we're concerned about its competitiveness, and to that end, we continue to work with the federal government on a fiscal framework that makes sense for the project, which we see as key to improving its competitiveness,&#34; he said. But Mr. Rolheiser would not repeat Mr. Tillerson's assertion that the project is &#34;uneconomic,&#34; retreating to the more vague description, &#34;economically challenged.&#34; Nor would he comment on Mr. Tillerson's suggestion that the project might be shelved. Bill Rodgers, a spokesman for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, Jim Prentice, said the minister was unaware of Mr. Tillerson's comments, but that the government has had no indication Imperial is ready to walk away from the project or put it on the shelf. &#34;Nothing has changed as far as we can tell,&#34; he said. UBS Securities analyst Andrew Potter said it has been clear for some time that Imperial was unwilling to move forward with the project unless it gets generous tax and royalty breaks from Ottawa. Mr. Potter said he believes the pipeline project could yield an 8-per-cent rate of return at current natural gas prices on spot markets, but noted that Exxon and Imperial are notoriously cautious about using conservative price estimates for project planning. &#34;Uneconomic means different things to different people,&#34; he said. The analyst added that the federal government is hesitant to be seen as providing subsidies to the world's most profitable oil company but, at the same time, is eager to see the project proceed because it would open the North to further natural gas development. &#34;It's a strategic project for the nation; it's a strategic project for North American gas supply,&#34; he said.
