Edwards for $6.8B Thursday, May 31, 2007 NEW YORK &#151; Wachovia Corp. ( ), the fourth-largest U.S. bank, Thursday said it will buy for $6.8 billion in cash and stock, creating the second-largest U.S. retail brokerage. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia expects to fold A.G. Edwards into its Wachovia Securities brokerage, pushing deeper into metropolitan areas. The combined brokerage would have about 14,784 brokers, ranking behind Merrill Lynch & Co. ; and $1.15 trillion of client assets, ranking third behind Merrill and Citigroup Inc., Wachovia said. It would employ more than 31,000 people, and command a 14 percent market share. "Long-term growth opportunities of the brokerage industry are extremely compelling to Wachovia," Wachovia Chief Executive Ken Thompson said in a statement. "This combination ... will further enhance our scale and relevance." A.G. Edwards shareholders will receive 0.9844 of a Wachovia share and $35.80 in cash for each of their shares. The terms value A.G. Edwards at $89.50 per share, a 16 percent premium over their Wednesday closing price. A.G. Edwards shares had already risen 22 percent this year. The transaction comes nearly eight months after Wachovia completed the $24.2 billion purchase of U.S. savings and loan Golden West Financial Corp. "(We) see significant cost savings as well as opportunities for Wachovia to overlay its broader product set," wrote Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Jason Goldberg. "The purchase also reduces its mortgage contribution (to overall results)." Wachovia has 8,166 brokers and $773 billion of client assets. A.G. Edwards, founded in 1887, has 6,618 brokers and $374 billion of client assets. The combined brokerage would keep its name and be based in St. Louis, home of A.G. Edwards. Prudential Financial Inc. has a 38 percent stake in Wachovia Securities, and said it supports the merger. Wachovia Securities Chief Executive Daniel Ludeman will retain his title, while A.G. Edwards Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Bagby will be chairman. Bagby, reached at his St. Louis office, said he could not comment. Wachovia expects $395 million of cost savings, or 10 percent of combined expenses, and to incur $860 million of merger charges over 18 months. It expects the transaction to boost earnings per share excluding items in the first year, and generate a 24 percent internal rate of return. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Credit Suisse, Wachovia Securities and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP represented Wachovia on the transaction, while Goldman Sachs & Co. and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz represented A.G. Edwards. Wachovia shares closed Wednesday at $54.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The combined firm will have an enhanced share of the U.S. brokerage market with significantly increased penetration in 48 of the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas.

Based on Wachovia's share price at the close of business on May 30, 2007, the deal values the St. Louis, Missouri-based A .G. Edwards at $89.50 per share, which represents 16% premium to A .G. Edwards' Wednesday's closing price of $77.15. The combined organization is expected to achieve annual expense efficiencies of $395 million by 2009, accounting for 10% of the combined firm's most recent fiscal year-end expense base. The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Wachovia's earnings per share, excluding items, in the first full year, following the closing. The transaction also provides an internal rate of return of 24%, far exceeding Wachovia's cost of capital. The merger, subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2007. Meanwhile, the full integration is expected to be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2009. In connection with the deal, Wachovia expects to record charges and exit cost purchase accounting adjustments of about $860 million over the 18-month integration period. Commenting on the deal, Ken Thompson, Wachovia's chairman and CEO, said, "The long-term growth opportunities of the brokerage industry are extremely compelling to Wachovia. This combination with A.G. Edwards, which is widely considered one of the most highly regarded remaining independent brokerage firms in the industry, will further enhance our scale and relevance." The merged entity, which would be headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, will have 3,350 brokerage locations, offering objective advice to clients based on research from multiple providers. A.G. Edwards will come under Wachovia Securities, LLC. The combined retail brokerage organization will be Other A.G. Edwards businesses including research, underwriting and investment banking, mutual funds and trust.

Meanwhile, A.G. Edwards' Chairman and CEO Robert Bagby will become the chairman of the combined brokerage firm. Wachovia Securities reports to David Carroll, president of Wachovia Corp.'s Capital Management Group. Caroll stated, “As consolidation continues in the brokerage industry, the opportunity to combine with a premier firm like A.G. Edwards was a rare chance to solidify our leadership in the industry with the scope and resources required to be the firm of choice for clients and for quality financial advisors.” Carroll noted that Wachovia is known for its success and expertise in integrations, including six brokerage firms since 1998, of which the joint venture with Prudential Securities was the largest. John Strangfeld, vice chairman of Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU), which currently owns 38% of Wachovia Securities, said, "We believe the combination of A.G. Edwards and Wachovia Securities is highly attractive and takes the business to a new level of prominence and promise. We have complete confidence in management's ability to make this deal successful."

Tello said the lawsuit was filed at the Tampa Courts on May 29. Odyssey announced two week ago it had discovered a shipwreck it has codenamed “Black Swan” and 500,000 gold and silver coins somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. They only described the ship as a 17th-century merchant vessel that sank about 40 miles off the south-western tip of Cornwall. But the Florida-based company would not say exactly where the ship was or name it, citing security concerns. © Thomas Crosbie Media, 2007.

The cases involve the alleged mistreatment of Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian citizen, in July 2002 and January 2004; Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen, in May 2002; and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian citizen, in December 2001, ACLU officials said. Mohamed is currently being held in Guant&#225;namo Bay, Cuba; Britel in Morocco and Agiza in Egypt, the ACLU said in a statement. The three have claimed through their family and lawyers that they have been tortured and abused against universally accepted legal standards. Their attorneys appealed to the ACLU for assistance. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in California, charges that flight services provided by Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc. enabled the clandestine transportation of the men to secret overseas locations, where they were tortured and subjected to other "forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment." Mike Pound, a spokesman for Jeppesen, said company officials had not yet seen the lawsuit and had no immediate comment. Bush urges 15 major countries set global emission goal by 2008 Zoellick has new agenda for World Bank Bush calls on Congress to increase funds for fighting AIDS He said Jeppesen provides support services, rather than the flights themselves, for airlines, private pilots and companies. "We don&#039;t know the purpose of the trip for which we do a flight plan," he said. "We don&#039;t need to know specific details. It&#039;s the customer&#039;s business, and we do the business that we are contracted for. It&#039;s not our practice to ever inquire about the purpose of a trip." Boeing itself is not named in the lawsuit and would not confirm the reports of a Jeppesen-CIA link, said spokesman Tim Neale, adding that customers have a confidentiality clause. "Either (Jeppesen) knew or reasonably should have known that they were facilitating a torture program," ACLU attorney Ben Wizner said. Companies "are not allowed to have their head in the sand, and take money from the CIA to fly people, hooded and shackled, to foreign countries to be tortured," said Wizner. Neither the CIA nor the U.S. government is named in the lawsuit. Wizner said the executive branch has evoked a state secrets defense in similar lawsuits. The lawsuit says Jeppesen "furnished essential flight and logistical support to aircraft used by the CIA to transfer terror suspects to secret detention and interrogation facilities in countries such as Morocco and Egypt where, according to the U.S. Department of State, the use of torture is &#039;routine,&#039; as well as to U.S.-run detention facilities overseas, where the United States government maintains that the safeguards of U.S. law do not apply." The Bush administration has insisted it receives guarantees from countries receiving terror suspects that prisoners will not be tortured. The ACLU said its lawsuit was being filed under the Alien Tort Statute, which permits aliens to bring claims in the United States for violations of the law of nations or a United States treaty.

http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/murdoch-spends-327m-in-web-spree/2007/05/31/1180205425165.html&cid Murdoch spends $327m in web spree - Business - Business - smh.com.au Welcome to The Sydney Morning Herald. Murdoch spends $327m in web spree NEWS CORP'S internet division has plunged further into the fast-growing world of amateur video, buying two young companies for a combined $US270 million ($327 million). Fox Interactive Media spent about $US250 million for Photobucket, which draws more than 30 million monthly visitors who view and store billions of digital photographs, videos and slideshows. News Corp also spent more than $US20 million for little-known Flektor, which offers free tools for editing and displaying online videos. Both companies' services are aimed at people who post web profiles on social-networking sites including Fox Interactive's prize property, MySpace. In the short term, Fox expects the purchases to help it capture more web surfers and keep their attention for longer. Like MySpace, both Photobucket and Flektor are set up to make most of their money through advertising. But Fox also hopes to push the creative products to News Corp's broader audience, Fox Interactive president Peter Levinsohn said. That could foster an increase in user-submitted content across the company's stable of internet properties, including AmericanIdol.com and video-game fan site IGN.com. In one potential use, Mr Levinsohn said, a high school sports fan could record a local game and then post it to FoxSports.com. The idea also could extend to local news footage. "We now control the single busiest social media site, the single biggest personal media destination, and what I think is the coolest set of tools that exist today," Mr Levinsohn said, referring to MySpace, Photobucket and Flektor respectively. "And we will take it to another level." Gartner analyst Mike McGuire said the Flektor tools could help fuel political expression. A citizen commentator could take a video clip from a debate and add their thoughts, then post the combination to MySpace or Google's YouTube. Mr McGuire said News Corp now appeared to be doing the best job of any "old media" company in staying abreast, or even ahead, of what consumers want to do with videos and photos. "Consumers are now in absolute control of how they want to access media and program media," Mr McGuire said. "Having these properties on top of MySpace, which we can almost view as a platform, is very smart." The deals were announced the same day that CBS confirmed its own jump into social networking with the $U280 million purchase of Last.fm, a site organised around sharing musical preferences. The new-media buyout spree this week also saw dominant online auction firm EBay announcing the $US75 million acquisition of StumbleUpon, a site with more than 2 million users who recommend internet pages, including those within social networks, for people to visit. For now, Denver-based Photobucket and Culver City, California-based Flektor will operate independently within Fox Interactive. The executives at both closely held firms will stay at Fox, and they can earn more from the sales if they meet performance targets. The Flektor and Photobucket services will continue to function on sites that compete with MySpace, Fox says. The Photobucket deal consummates what had been a stormy relationship. Taking note of how many MySpace users turned to Photobucket to manage their pictures, Fox Interactive for months had considered bidding for the company. Flektor was started by video-game industry veterans just a year ago. send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today Murdoch spends $327m in web spree Place a classified ad Copyright &#169; 2007.

Prosecutors did not say why they dropped the count, but evidently believed the evidence presented by the government over more than 10 weeks of trial thus far might not support a conviction. Former media mogul Conrad Black arrives at federal court in Chicago, Wednesday. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) Federal spokesman Randall Samborn said he would have no comment on the decision, which came with no fanfare while jurors were out of the courtroom and a number of issues were being discussed by the judge and attorneys. "At this time the prosecution rests," Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Sussman told U.S. District Judge Amy St. Eve, ending the government's case against Black. Attorneys for the beleaguered former press lord and three co-defendants were scheduled to begin calling witnesses Thursday in what is expected to be a much less time-consuming case for the defence. Black, 62, and three other former executives of Hollinger International are charged with swindling the newspaper holding company out of millions of dollars through the sale of Hollinger assets. The alleged scheme began with a decision in the late 1990s by Black, who was the company's chairman, to sell hundreds of small Hollinger-owned community newspapers across the United States and Canada. Millions of dollars were paid to Hollinger in exchange for promises that it wouldn't go into competition with the new owners of the papers. Prosecutors say Black and two of his co-defendants, former Hollinger vice presidents John Boultbee and Peter Atkinson, illegally diverted much of the money to themselves with help from corporate counsel Mark Kipnis. Kipnis also is on trial. All four of the defendants maintain that they did nothing illegal. The prosecution rested its case amid bickering over 13 boxes Black removed from the company's headquarters in Toronto late in the afternoon of May 20, 2005, in defiance of a court order. Jurors on Wednesday saw pictures captured by security cameras of the former Hollinger CEO hauling the boxes out of the headquarters building and loading them into a waiting limousine that promptly whisked them away. Black, who is charged with obstruction of justice in the incident, was forced to return the boxes, which sat on an evidence cart next to the jury box while the jurors viewed the security camera photos on a large screen. After jurors had gone home Wednesday, Black defence attorney Marc Martin argued that the obstruction count should be thrown out along with the money-laundering count because there was no proof of wrongdoing. "We don't know what Mr. Black's intention was," Martin said. He said no harm was done because Black eventually returned the boxes intact. But Sussman argued that the obstruction of justice was blatant and that Black had defied not only a Canadian court order but an American court and a federal grand jury before finally returning the boxes. "We will probably never know what Mr. Black took - we do know what Mr. Black returned," Sussman told St. Eve. St. Eve gave both sides until June 5 to file briefs expanding on their arguments. Martin said he would ask her to drop other counts, as well. Earlier, while jurors were still eating lunch, debate among the attorneys returned to the recurring theme of how much of Black's flamboyant rhetoric and obvious zest for the finer things in life should be allowed into evidence. St. Eve barred Sussman from reading to jurors one sentence from a memo that Black wrote when he was criticized by shareholders for using the Hollinger corporate jet for a vacation on Bora Bora in French Polynesia. She did allow Sussman to read this portion to jurors: "We have to find a balance between an unfair taxation on the company and a reasonable treatment of the founder-builder-managers. We are proprietors, after all, beleaguered though we may be." But she said this portion would pose too much danger of prejudicing the jury: "I'm not prepared to re-enact the French revolutionary renunciation of the rights of the nobility." &copy; The Canadian Press, 2007 Solid economic growth in Q1 adds to loonie's rise The Canadian economy grew at a slightly better than expected annual rate of 3.7 per cent through the first three months of the year â€” news that helped push the loonie higher.

Agrees to Buy Photobucket and Flektor - New York Times A Unit of News Corp. Agrees to Buy Photobucket and Flektor Sign In to E-Mail or Save This By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Published: May 31, 2007 Fox Interactive Media, a unit of the , has agreed to acquire the photo-storage site Photobucket, just weeks after a public spat in which the popular networking site MySpace partly blocked content from Photobucket. MySpace, which is also owned by the News Corporation, lifted the block after about two weeks, but both sides have been silent on the details of their peacemaking. Separately, Fox also agreed to buy Flektor Inc., which offers Web-based tools for creating slide shows, recombined videos and other interactive presentations. Financial terms of the two deals were not disclosed. MySpace users often embed third-party photos, video and other material in their personal profile pages, and sites like Photobucket and YouTube, ’s video-sharing site, make that easy by providing the programming code to cut and paste into MySpace pages. The practice has made Photobucket one of the leading sites on the Internet, even though relatively few users access content directly through its home page. MySpace blocked Photobucket in April, after complaining that the hosting service had been encouraging users to incorporate an ad-supported slide show into their MySpace profiles. MySpace said the slide show violated its policies banning unauthorized commercial activity. Photobucket’s chief executive, Alex Welch, responded by accusing MySpace of limiting free expression and treating users as a commodity. He was more conciliatory two weeks later, saying the two had “established open lines of communication and procedures,” but he made no mention of negotiations over a sale of his company.

http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/eBay-buys-online-search-site-StumbleUpon/2007/05/31/1180205385474.html&cid eBay buys online search site StumbleUpon - Breaking News - World - Breaking News Welcome to The Age. eBay buys online search site StumbleUpon May 31, 2007 - 10:19AM Online auction house eBay has acquired StumbleUpon, a software startup that suggests websites based on reader reviews and personal preferences of its members. The $US75 million ($A91.2 million) cash acquisition gives eBay access to about 2.3 million people who have filled out profiles at StumbleUpon, founded in 2001 by three Canadian software engineers in Calgary. The venture capital-funded company, which recently relocated to San Francisco, is considered a pioneer of the so-called Web 3.0 niche. The term refers to technology that pairs general internet search capability with a user's personal data and aggregated community data, theoretically delivering more relevant results than a standard search engine such as Google. For example, a StumbleUpon search for "cars" could generate a list of web pages that factor in a user's income, age, gender, home address, current vehicles owned and other demographic data submitted. The search results would also include sites ranked favourably by other StumbleUpon members with similar interests and background. By contrast, a straight Google search delivers 357 million web pages ranging from the popular Hollywood movie Cars to advertisements for used car dealers and newspaper classified sections. StumbleUpon is free for users and generates revenue through advertising, though the company doesn't disclose financial information. Members who pay an annual fee bypass advertisements completely. Michael Buhr, senior director at San Jose-based eBay, will serve as general manager of StumbleUpon. StumbleUpons founders and managers will become eBay employees. "StumbleUpon is a great fit within our goal of pioneering new communities based on commerce and sustained by trust," Buhr said. The acquisition is not expected to change eBay's latest financial guidance. The company expects to report second-quarter profit of 31 to 33 US cents per share on sales in the range of $US1.75 billion to $US1.8 billion ($A2.1 billion to $A2.19 billion). For the full year, eBay expects profit of $US1.30 to $US1.34 per share on sales of $US7.2 billion to $US7.45 billion ($A8.8 billion to $A9.1 billion). The 12-year-old e-commerce powerhouse had $US3.5 billion ($A4.3 billion) in cash last month and has been aggressively acquiring smaller companies to compete against rivals ranging from Google to Amazon.com. EBay, which already owns internet phone service Skype and portals such as Shopping.com and Rent.com, completed the buyout of online ticket reseller StubHub for $US310 million ($A377.1 million) earlier this year.

IBM lays off another 1,500 workers May 31, 2007 - 6:59AM IBM has laid off 1,570 people primarily from an ongoing overhaul of operations in its giant technology services unit. The Armonk, New York-based company carried out a similar level of job cuts at the beginning of the month, for a total of 3,023 in this quarter and 3,720 for the year, according to IBM spokesman Edward Barbini. That amounts to roughly one per cent of the company, which employed 355,000 people at the beginning of the year. But even these small numbers reflect a big project inside IBM to transform its business. Services is IBM's biggest division by revenue, but the advent of lower-cost competition overseas has forced IBM to work harder to improve the unit's profit margins. In the first quarter, pretax income for IBM's tech services fell 19 per cent, even as revenue rose seven per cent. Wednesday's job cuts were largely part of the company's response. Although IBM did not disclose where the layoffs were being made, the company had blamed the first-quarter profit shortfall on problems in its US outsourcing business. IBM executives say they expect no more layoffs this quarter. But other shifts like this - IBM calls it "rebalancing" - figure to follow from time to time. That's because IBM's services overhaul not only involves cheaper labour - IBM's work force in India rose from 9,000 in 2003 to 52,000 last year - but also a quest to use less labour. That means rethinking and sometimes automating the ways that services contracts are carried out. Last year, IBM adopted a business-retooling system known as Lean last year to find such opportunities. Robert Moffat, the IBM executive overseeing Lean, acknowledges it will reduce the need for some services labour, but he contends that it will also create new work for the company overall because customers will be getting more for their money. send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today 15 killed in Yemen petrol station strike Missile test response to US moves: Putin Police to charge man over stabbing IBM lays off another 1,500 workers Place a classified ad Copyright &#169; 2007.

Terms of the deals were not disclosed. Earlier, a source familiar with the talks said the Photobucket deal was worth about $250 million. A separate source said on Wednesday the Flektor deal was worth about $20 million. Which phone company plans to use Microsoft's new Surface computer? Test Your Knowledge -- More Questions Resources for anyone who runs a small business or wants to start one. Small Business on the Net Save & Share Article The two purchases are part of News Corp.'s plan to bolster its Internet businesses, which are expected to generate about $500 million this fiscal year, and about $1 billion in 2008. Photobucket lets its more than 42 million users upload photos and videos, which can be pasted on their own Web sites, blogs and social networks like MySpace. Some 40 percent of its users have already posted their content on MySpace. Culver City, California-based Flektor offers easy-to-use software tools to manipulate photos and videos. Fox Interactive President Peter Levinsohn said in a telephone interview he saw Flektor's technology being used across other News Corp.-owned Internet services, including AmericanIdol.com and games-related IGN. "If you combine MySpace, the largest social networking platform in the U.S., and Photobucket, the preeminent personal media destination, we feel like we've got a fantastic package of assets that differentiates us in the marketplace," Levinsohn said. The long-anticipated Photobucket deal comes after a high profile but short-lived flap between the two companies. MySpace blocked photos from Photobucket when Photobucket began displaying ads in photo windows that appeared on MySpace. Fox executives said the Photobucket had run afoul of MySpace's terms of service agreement that forbids companies from the unauthorized commercial use of the service. Levinsohn said Fox has been reviewing its terms of services agreement to explore relaxing current rules regarding third-party commercial use, amid far smaller rival Facebook's move to allow so-called widget companies to profit from its service. "The fact that they're (Facebook) enabling them (third party widget companies) to sell ads is something we're looking at and have been looking at," Levinsohn said. "Do I think at some point we will change that? We're looking at it every day to try to come up with the right solution." Far fewer number of users are on Facebook, which up until last September was closed to regular users, who did not attend college. But it has embarked on an aggressive expansion plan and last week announced 65 partnerships to allow widget companies that create software to run on other services like MySpace and Facebook to begin building and profiting from Web applications for Facebook. Photobucket serves about 3.5 billion images each day across the Internet. Users of the service upload about 50,000 new videos per day, similar to MySpace user statistics, Levinsohn said. The deal "confirms our position as easily the No. 2 player in the online video space," he said, behind Google Inc.'s Photobucket will be operated as a standalone site and continue to serve some 300,000 other Web sites.

Lee Partners LP and insurance provider Fidelity National Financial Inc. in a cash deal valued at about $5.3 billion. Under the terms of the deal, Ceridian shareholders will receive $36 for each share they own. The deal represents a 5.3 percent premium over Ceridian's closing price on Wednesday and a 17 percent premium over its closing price Feb. 12, the last trading day before the company announced it was looking into strategic options. "We believe these firms bring complementary skills which will help us build upon our leadership position as we continue to implement our strategic plan," said Kathryn V. Marinello, president and chief executive, in a statement. Ceridian announced that it was looking into strategic options after the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management LP pressured the company to spin off its fast-growing Comdata division, writing to the company's board that it was concerned the division would be worth more as a stand-alone company. Comdata issues and process credit and gift cards. Investors have also been hoping that Ceridian could make its human resources business more profitable. Ceridian, in its statement, said the Comdata division was kept in mind as the board evaluated several strategic alternatives. Fidelity National Chairman and Chief Executive William P. Foley II cited Ceridian's position in large, growing markets and its strong cash flow, among other factors, in explaining Fidelity's interest in the company. "We are very excited about our investment in Ceridian," he said. THL Partners and Fidelity National said they expect to bring co-investors into the transaction. Fidelity National will own less than 50 percent of Ceridian at closing. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Shares of Ceridian -- based in the Twin Cities suburb of Bloomington -- rose 47 cents to $34.19 in regular trading. In aftermarket activity, they added another $1.41, or 4.1 percent, to $35.60. The stock has ranged from $21.76 to $35.35 over the past year. Fidelity National shares rose 57 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $27.57, then lost 7 cents after hours. Earlier Wednesday, shares traded at a new 52-week high of $27.59. (Copyright 2007 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)

Within the last 15 minutes, the Chicago PMI rose to 61.7 in May from 52.9 in April, easily topping the consensus estimate of 54.0. A number above 50 reflects growth and the data raise hopes that tomorrow's more influential national ISM survey will also show strength. The report's growth indication is helping to offset earlier data that showed the economy grew at only a 0.6% rate in Q1. That signaled the weakest expansion in more than four years; but the first quarter is long over and yesterday's FOMC Minutes suggested the economy is picking up steam. whenever this page is updated go to Try the Best for FREE!

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070531.wblacktor31/BNStory/ConradBlack/home&cid reportonbusiness.com: Prosecutors drop laundering charge against Black Letters to the Editor Prosecutors drop laundering charge against Black Defence lawyers to begin their cases From Thursday's Globe and Mail May 31, 2007 at 3:56 AM EDT &#151; Prosecutors ended their case against Conrad Black yesterday by withdrawing one criminal charge and showing the jury more examples of Lord Black's lavish lifestyle and colourful language. &#34;At this time, the government rests,&#34; lead prosecutor Eric Sussman told the court in mid-afternoon, ending more than two months of witness testimony, legal arguments and document presentation, all aimed at persuading jurors that Lord Black should go to prison. Just before that, Mr. Sussman withdrew a money-laundering charge against Lord Black. The charge was among the most serious Lord Black faced and it had been added to the indictment with great fanfare by prosecutors, along with racketeering, in December of 2005. The charge related to agreements struck when Hollinger International Inc. sold most of its Canadian newspapers to CanWest Global Communications Corp. in 2000 for $3.2-billion. In that transaction, $80-million was set aside to cover payments under non-competition agreements CanWest signed with Lord Black and three other Hollinger executives. Lord Black and David Radler, who pleaded guilty, each received about $18-million. Former National Post editor to testify Black trial sees video of box removal Assistant could be defence's first witness Conrad Black trial loses another juror Black trial nearing end 'Dear Donald, Could I ask a rather esoteric favor? &hellip;' How Black built his empire');"> How Black built his empire When Lord Black and the others were charged, prosecutors alleged all of the non-competition payments should have gone to Hollinger. Shortly after the trial began, prosecutors conceded that the payments to Lord Black and Mr. Radler were legal but they said Lord Black still faced charges for arranging non-competes for defendants Peter Atkinson and John Boultbee. The money-laundering charge, which relates to the wiring of Lord Black's non-compete funds, only applied to Lord Black and it related directly to the CanWest deal. Mr. Sussman and lawyers for Lord Black declined to comment. Lord Black still faces several charges of fraud, racketeering and tax evasion stemming from non-competition agreements in other Hollinger deals. Prosecutors ended their case yesterday the way they began it, by showing the jury some of Lord Black's e-mails. In an e-mail sent to a Hollinger director, Lord Black referred to a shareholder revolt over the non-competition payments as &#34;regrettable nonsense.&#34; A later e-mail to Mr. Atkinson called the company a &#34;vehicle for extracting money as in the non competes.&#34; Prosecutors also gave the jury a glimpse into Lord Black's personal life yesterday by showing some of the items he stuffed into 13 boxes that he carted out of his Toronto office on May 20, 2005. Prosecutors have alleged Lord Black was obstructing justice by removing the boxes, but Lord Black has insisted he was only taking personal items. He returned the boxes within days. Prosecutor Jeffrey Cramer showed the jury several bank statements found in the boxes. The statement indicated that Lord Black purchased a $2.6-million, 26-carat diamond ring from Graff Diamond Ltd. The bank records also showed Lord Black spent $116,000 at Yves St. Laurent, $150,000 at a book dealer, and $101,000 at Fendi. In court filings, prosecutors have alleged Lord Black used Hollinger money to pay for many personal expenses. The expenses and e-mails will likely figure prominently when prosecutors make their closing arguments. For weeks, prosecutors have tried to use these sorts of documents to illustrate Lord Black's disdain for shareholders and his sense of entitlement. &#34;Mr. Black believes this is his company and he is above the shareholders,&#34; Mr. Sussman said yesterday during a hearing without the jury present. Much of the prosecution case also rests on whether the jury finds their witnesses credible. Many of the high-profile prosecution witnesses, such as former Illinois governor James Thompson, former ambassador Richard Burt and economist Marie-Jos&#233;e Kravis, faced rough cross-examinations that dented their credibility. All three acknowledged they did not read key company documents. Mr. Radler also faced gruelling questioning about past lies and whether he reached a plea agreement to save himself. Prosecutors will likely try to draw the jury back to some of their first witnesses, who faced fewer challenges. Those witnesses included several men who bought newspapers from Hollinger and who testified that they did not want non-competition agreements with Lord Black and the others. One of the buyers, Michael Reed, told the jury that he refused to wire payments to Lord Black and the others. Defence lawyers will begin presenting their cases today. They are expected to take about two weeks in total and there is little indication that Lord Black or any of the others will testify.

Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Economy nearly stalled in first quarter By JEANNINE AVERSA AP Economics Writer Article Launched: 05/31/2007 05:33:19 AM PDT Click photo to enlarge Shoppers stroll along New York's Fifth Ave., Tuesday, May 29, 2007. Consumer confidence bounced back unexpectedly in May, despite higher gasoline prices that could raise shoppers' worries about inflation, the Conference Board said Tuesday. WASHINGTON- The economy nearly stalled in the first quarter with growth slowing to a pace of just 0.6 percent. That was the worst three-month showing in over four years. The new reading on the gross domestic product, released by the Commerce Department Thursday, showed that economic growth in the January-through-March quarter was much weaker. Government statisticians slashed by more than half their first estimate of a 1.3 percent growth rate for the quarter. The main culprits for the downgrade: the bloated trade deficit and businesses cutting investment in supplies of the goods they hold in inventories. "We are still keeping our head above water&mdash;barely," said economist Ken Mayland of ClearView Economics. For nearly a year, the economy has been enduring a stretch of subpar economic growth due mostly to a sharp housing slump. That in turn has made some businesses act more cautiously in their spending and investing. The economy's 0.6 percent growth rate in the opening quarter of this year marked a big loss of momentum from the 2.5 percent pace logged in the final quarter of last year. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke doesn't believe the economy will slide into recession this year, nor do Bush administration officials. But ex-Fed chief Alan Greenspan has put the odds at one in three. On Wall Street, investors took the weak GDP showing in stride. The Dow Jones industrials were up 22 points and the Nasdaq gained 14 points in morning trading. The first-quarter's performance was the weakest since the final quarter of 2002, when the economy was recovering from a recession. At that time, GDP eked out a 0.2 percent growth rate. Economists were predicting the first-quarter performance this year would be downgraded, but not as much as it did. They were calling for a 0.8 percent pace. GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced in the United States. It is considered the best measure of the country's economic fitness. In other economic news, the Labor Department reported that fewer people signed up for unemployment benefits last week. New filings dropped by 4,000 to 310,000. That suggests the employment climate is weathering well the economy's sluggish spell. Another report showed that construction spending edged up by 0.1 percent in April, down from a 0.6 percent gain in the previous month. Spending by private builders on nonresidential projects and spending by the government on big projects each climbed to all time highs in April but that strength was tempered by continued weakness in residential construction. In the GDP report, many economists believe the first quarter will be the low point for this year. They expect growth will improve but still be sluggish. The National Association for Business Economics predicts the economy will expand at a 2.3 percent pace in the April-to-June quarter. In the first quarter, there was a larger trade deficit than first thought. That ended up shaving a full percentage point from the GDP. Businesses cut back on inventory investment as they tried to make sure unsold stocks of goods didn't get out of whack with customer demand. That lopped off nearly a percentage point to first quarter GDP. Those were the biggest factors behind the government slicing its initial GDP estimate released a month ago by as much as it did. The sour housing market also restrained overall economic activity. Investment in home building was cut by 15.4 percent, on an annualized basis, in the first quarter. However, that wasn't as deep a cut as the 17 percent annualized drop initially estimated. And, it wasn't as severe as the 19.8 percent annualized drop seen in the final quarter of last year. Even so, there is no doubt that troubled housing market is one of the biggest problems for the economy. Although some businesses tightened the belt in the first quarter, consumers did not. That helped to prevent the economy from stalling out altogether. Consumers boosted their spending by a 4.4 percent growth rate in the first quarter, the most in a year. Consumer spending accounts for a major chunk of economic activity. Some economists wonder how much interest consumers will have in continued brisk spending, however, given rising gasoline prices that have topped $3 a gallon in many markets. More money spent filling up the gas tank leaves less to spend on other things. One of the reasons consumers have stayed so resilient even as the housing market has been stuck in a rut for a year is because the job market has been good. Employers&mdash;still enjoying profits&mdash;are keeping a close watch on spending but they are not drastically clamping down on hiring. Companies profits gained a bit of ground in the first quarter. One measure showed after tax profits rising by 1 percent, up from 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter. An inflation gauge tied to the GDP report and closely watched by the Fed showed that core prices&mdash;excluding food and energy&mdash;rose at a rate of 2.2 percent in the first quarter. That was unchanged from an initial estimate but up from a 1.8 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The Federal Reserve's key interest rate has been at 5.25 percent for nearly a year. Many economists predict the rate probably will stay right where it is through the rest of this year.

None of the 15 shareholder proposals that were up for approval at the annual meeting received 50 percent of the shareholder vote, but four dealing with pay and governance received at least 40 percent. All four measures would increase the accountability of Exxon's management and board for their policies and performance. About 47.8 percent of the voting shareholders backed a measure that would give holders of 10 percent of Exxon's outstanding common shares the right to call special shareholder meetings and 47.2 percent favored a proposal to allow the company to recoup incentive bonuses it determined not to be justified. Proposals to give shareholders an advisory vote on executive pay and to split the chief executive and chairman positions got 41.2 percent and 40 percent of the vote, respectively. But climate change was the central topic of discussion at the meeting and one environmental proposal -- that the company adopt goals for greenhouse gas reductions from its products and operations -- received 31 percent of the shareholder vote. Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson disputed claims by investor activists and environmentalists that the company is working to mislead the public about the causes of climate change. "What I find perplexing is why people feel threatened because we want to have a discussion," Tillerson said, when offering an explanation for why the company funds some groups that are skeptical of the mainstream scientific views of climate change. "I'm not going to just adopt a slogan. If that makes me public enemy number one, so be it," he said. Investors also voted in all 12 nominees to Exxon's board, including Michael Boskin, who received 93 percent of the vote despite an effort by a group of investors to unseat him in protest of the company's climate policy. PROTESTS OUTSIDE, INSIDE MEETING About three dozen protesters -- outnumbered by police -- staged a peaceful demonstration outside the meeting against the company's funding of groups they believe deny or distort the science of global warming. The protesters waved banners with slogans like "People Before Profits" and chanted "No More Junk Science." "Exxon Mobil is double-crossing the public and policy makers. It's avoiding real changes and continuing to fund groups that purposefully distort the science of global warming," said Shawnee Hoover, the campaign director of Exxpose Exxon, a coalition of green and scientific groups. They say the company still funds about 40 organizations that the environmental group classified as "global warming deniers," shelling out over $2 million to the groups in 2006. Exxon disagrees with the claim that the groups, many of which concern themselves with a wide range of issues, are "deniers of climate change." Exxon has said man-made greenhouse gas emissions could be a source of global warming, while arguing that climate science is still uncertain. Most scientists believe the use of fossil fuels causes global warming. Shareholder activists inside the meeting also took advantage of the opportunity to air their grievances about Exxon's environmental record. "Can you imagine what would happen if the largest company in the world stood up and took a leadership position" on climate change, Sister Patricia Daly, a Dominican nun, asked Tillerson. "We are challenged by one of the most profound moral concerns and we have the wherewithal to respond," she said. Tillerson generally listened quietly as the shareholder proposals were presented, but became more lively as he disputed criticism of his company during the question and answer period that followed. He said Exxon would continue to fund scientific research on climate change so the company can understand it better. He also addressed claims that the company's environmental policy would leave it at a financial disadvantage to its peers who have already made more concessions on the issue. "If that makes us not Shell -- well, based on my results, I'm kind of glad we are not Shell," he said, referring to competitor Royal Dutch Shell. (c) Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

After nearly 3 months government rests, leaving doubts about strength of its case By Ameet Sachdev and Susan Chandler Published May 31, 2007 Eleven weeks into the federal fraud trial of Conrad Black and three other former Hollinger International Inc. executives, the prosecution rested Wednesday. The defense starts Thursday. The case against Black, an international media baron, was a guaranteed sensation because of its colorful plot line: A rich and powerful publisher with a jet-setting lifestyle, an outsize personality and a glamorous wife, accused of looting the company he built from scratch almost 40 years ago. While living mainly in Canada and named a lord in Britain, Black had a significant Chicago footprint: Hollinger International, now known as Sun-Times Media Group Inc., is based here and owns the Chicago Sun-Times. But testimony, while focusing at times on a lavish New York dinner and a trip to Bora Bora, is exceedingly complex, presenting prosecutors with a difficult challenge of proving wrongdoing. It has been a marathon for jurors, who have endured days of tedious testimony from auditors and outside attorneys who advised the company about whether $60 million in so-called non-compete payments to Hollinger's top executives had to be disclosed to shareholders. They also listened to prominent Hollinger directors, including former Illinois Gov. James Thompson, who said they were kept in the dark about the payments. But the directors couldn't explain how they had missed repeated written disclosures of the non-competes that were included in documents they were supposed to review. The biggest showdown was the appearance of Black's longtime No. 2, now the government's star witness, former Hollinger President F. David Radler. He presented crucial testimony about Black orchestrating a scheme to steal money from the company, but he also confessed to being a serial liar. Despite his legal troubles, Black has maintained his high profile, giving interviews about his new biography of Richard Nixon and speaking out about his innocence on the courthouse steps to reporters. His co-defendants, John Boultbee, Peter Atkinson and Mark Kipnis, have been overshadowed by Black's persona and performance. The Tribune asked Hugh Totten, a Perkins Coie attorney who has been observing the trial, and Steven Skurka, a Canadian legal analyst who has been writing a Conrad Black blog, to offer their thoughts on how the prosecution fared. THE WITNESS AND HIS TESTIMONY F. David Radler, former president and chief operating officer He is the star witness because he is the only senior executive charged who has pleaded guilty in exchange for a reduced sentence. Black's longtime business partner testified that during their phone conversations Black came up with a "template" to divert money from the company. He also said he kept the board's audit committee in the dark about the non-compete payments. Defense lawyers attacked his credibility, pointing out numerous times he lied before he cut a deal with prosecutors. The defense's assault went on for the better part of six days, and Radler frequently challenged questions, prompting rebukes from the judge. "Once again the only evidence we have of this private telephone call is your word?" asked Edward Greenspan, one of Black's lawyers. "That's correct," Radler replied. "Your word. Your word is the word of a liar," Greenspan said. "That's your interpretation," Radler answered. Radler may not have come across as an honest guy, but he buttressed the prosecution's argument that he and Black conspired to line their own pockets at the expense of shareholders, Totten said. It was disappointing that there is no smoking-gun documents to back up Radler's testimony. "I think he did what he needed to do, but there's no question he was a beaten man by the time he left the stand," Totten said. THE WITNESS AND HIS TESTIMONY Paul Healy, former vice president of investor relations His testimony established that there was something fishy about the New York apartment Black bought in 2000 from Hollinger for $3 million, the same price the company paid for the home six years earlier. Healy also described Black's disdain for activist shareholders who were questioning the non-compete payments. In audio recordings introduced through Healy, jurors heard Black fend off angry investors at two shareholder meetings. Healy testified under a grant of immunity. In an e-mail exchange between Healy and Black, Black dismissed complaints from Laura Jereski, an analyst at one of Hollinger's largest shareholders: "Laura's letter is nonsense, but obviously a number of shareholders are holding hands on this," he told Healy. "Much as I would like to just blow &#091;them&#093; off, I don't want a sour atmosphere at the shareholder meeting." Healy's portrayal as a corporate governance crusader took some hits as the defense showed sycophantic e-mails he sent to Black. The prosecution also did not call any shareholders to bolster Healy's testimony. But a real estate expert did support Healy's statement that Black did not pay fair market value for the apartment. "There's just nothing compelling enough about Healy's testimony to convict somebody," Totten said. THE WITNESS AND HIS TESTIMONY James Thompson, four-time governor of Illinois and chairman of Hollinger International's three-person audit committee Thompson testified that he was never informed about non-compete payments to Hollinger executives other than in the sale to CanWest of Hollinger's Canadian newspapers. Because the non-competes were "related party" transactions, they should have been brought to the attention of the audit committee. But Thompson also admitted he had missed written disclosures of the payments in numerous Hollinger financial statements and regulatory filings that were sent to him because he had "skimmed" the documents. "Yes, I should have read them word for word. I didn't. I skimmed them," Thompson said under cross-examination. "When you're skimming a document, you don't see everything in every paragraph," Black's lawyer Edward Greenspan shot back. "You were taught this? Is there some kind of skimming school?" Thompson did not help the prosecution, and he actually created confusion. He could not explain how he missed repeated written disclosures of the non-compete payments, sticking to the contention that "skimming" the documents didn't mean he was negligent in his duty to look out for Hollinger shareholders. In walking that tightrope, "Thompson became his own worst enemy," Totten said. By the time Thompson's cross-examination was over, "His credibility was in tatters," Skurka said.

All four worked in a group set up by the company in 1998 to develop tax shelters, according to an indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. They allegedly defrauded the Internal Revenue Service from 1998 through 2004 by designing, marketing and selling fraudulent tax shelters. U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said in a statement that the indictment targets "tax professionals whose deceit costs this country untold millions in tax revenues." An Ernst & Young spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment. It was not immediately known who would represent the four men at court appearances later Wednesday. The indictment said the partners knew that if the IRS detected use of the tax shelters by their clients, it would aggressively challenge the claimed tax benefits. To hide the tax fraud from the IRS, the defendants created documents containing false and fraudulent descriptions of the clients' motivations for entering into the transactions, the indictment said. The partners enticed clients to participate in the shelters by getting law firms to provide letters claiming that the tax shelter losses or deductions would "more likely than not" survive IRS challenge, the court papers said. The four knew the opinions were based on false and fraudulent statements but believed they would undermine the ability of the IRS to determine the clients' tax liabilities and decide whether penalties should be imposed, according to the indictment. The partners were seeking entry into the highly lucrative tax shelter market that was already being explored by other companies, the indictment said. Those charged were identified as Robert Coplan, 54, a Plano, Texas, lawyer who once was a branch chief in the IRS' Legislation and Regulations Division; Martin Nissenbaum, 51, of Brooklyn, a lawyer; Richard Shapiro, 58, of Rye Brook, N.Y., also a lawyer, and an accountant, Brian Vaughn, 39, of Calhoun, La. They were charged with conspiracy to defraud the IRS, tax evasion, making false statements and impeding and impairing the lawful functioning of the IRS. Copyright 2007 Associated Press.

Northwest used its 20 months in bankruptcy to carve $2.4 billion, or 20 percent, from its annual expenses. It slashed labor spending by $1.4 billion, or 40 percent. The fifth-largest U.S. airline also reorganized regional flights, trimmed its fleet by 13 percent, and replaced older fuel-guzzling planes. ``They were pretty aggressive,&#39;&#39; said William Warlick, a Fitch Inc. analyst in Chicago. ``The proof is in the pudding, and they&#39;re going to come out of bankruptcy with lower costs than virtually all other legacy carriers.&#39;&#39; The reorganization will produce a $794 million profit in 2007 after last year&#39;s $2.84 billion loss, Northwest estimates. Last quarter&#39;s operating profit margin was 7 percent, the best among major U.S. airlines. AMR Corp.&#39;s American Airlines was second with a 4.6 percent margin. Northwest, based in Eagan, Minnesota, was the last of four large U.S. airlines to file for bankruptcy after air travel slumped in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks. US Airways Group Inc., filed in August 2002 and again in September 2004; UAL Corp.&#39;s United Airlines in December 2002; and Delta Air Lines Inc. about 30 minutes before Northwest on Sept. 14, 2005. Northwest lost $4.62 billion from 2001 through 2005, and listed debt of $17.9 billion in its filing. ``They had the benefit of being the last through,&#39;&#39; said Robert Mann of R.W. Mann & Co., a Port Washington, New York- based consultant for airlines and labor groups. ``On that basis, they were able to work off everyone else&#39;s set of objectives.&#39;&#39; Before the filing, Chief Executive Officer Doug Steenland hired two lieutenants with a bankruptcy background at US Airways. Chief Financial Officer Neal Cohen joined four months before the bankruptcy, and Controller David Davis came aboard five days beforehand. ``They had a lot of experience and a lot to draw on in negotiating tough deals with labor groups and vendors,&#39;&#39; Warlick said. With ``relatively good&#39;&#39; non-labor costs, the airline focused on paring personnel expenses, said analyst Philip Baggaley of Standard & Poor&#39;s in New York. Steenland and his executives trimmed the workforce by 22 percent from June 30, 2005, to 30,008 employees as of March 31. They also pushed through reductions in salary, vacation time, sick leave, health-care benefits and crew meals and accommodations. The new, lower-cost union contracts run for five to six years, providing savings for a longer period than competitors&#39; wage agreements, Northwest said. ``These guys are as tough as they come,&#39;&#39; said Darryl Jenkins, an independent airline industry consultant in Marshall, Virginia. Excluding fuel, Northwest cut its cost to fly each seat one mile to 7.7 cents last year, from 8.9 cents before it filed for bankruptcy. That compared with 7.4 cents at Delta and 9.1 cents at United, according to Northwest. Unlike Delta, which exited bankruptcy April 30 after shifting jets to international routes, Northwest didn&#39;t have to change strategy. It already had a larger share of higher-profit overseas flights than most peers. About 41 percent of Northwest&#39;s capacity last year was on international routes, second only to the 47 percent of Continental Airlines Inc., according to Cathay Financial Inc. analyst Susan Donofrio in New York. The lack of an ``open skies&#39;&#39; agreement between China and the U.S. means Northwest and United will keep their edge in Pacific passenger traffic before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, said Roger King, a debt analyst for New York-based CreditSights Inc. ``They have a pretty nice asset in the Pacific and fly along the northern tier of the U.S., which means they have less low-cost carrier competition,&#39;&#39; King said. To further trim expenses and ferry passengers to U.S. hubs including Minneapolis and Detroit, Northwest started one new regional carrier, Compass Airlines, and bought another, Mesaba Airlines. It cut its fleet to 375 planes as of March 31, compared with 433 in mid-2005, including replacing all 15 DC-10s with newer jets to save on maintenance and fuel. The reorganization didn&#39;t help labor relations. Flight attendants rejected two tentative agreements for $195 million in concessions before approving a third this week, with 51 percent voting in support. The attendants and unions for pilots and other employees have criticized the carrier&#39;s plans to distribute $297 million in shares to Steenland and other managers. Northwest&#39;s unsecured creditors will get 236 million of the carrier&#39;s new shares, of a total of 263.8 million that the carrier plans to issue. The shares rose 68 cents to $25.18 at 9:58 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, valuing the creditors&#39; equity stake at $5.94 billion. Northwest&#39;s plan to sell $750 million in new shares beyond the stock distributed to creditors ``will bolster their balance sheet and cash further,&#39;&#39; S&P&#39;s Baggaley said. ``That&#39;s a move the other bankrupt airlines have not taken.&#39;&#39; To contact the reporter on this story: Susanna Ray in Chicago at Last Updated: May 31, 2007 10:04 EDT Related Media on Demand Neidl of Calyon Sees Northwest as `Tough Competitor&#39; Wachovia to Buy A.G.

The lay-offs bring to about 3,700 the number of jobs IBM has cut this year in its services unit, which accounts for about half of total revenue but whose profit lags the company's software business. Earlier this month, IBM eliminated about 1,300 jobs in the U.S. services business. The rest were cut in the first quarter. IBM, which had 355,766 employees at the end of 2006, said on April 17 it was cutting costs in the United States amid weaker U.S. demand for its services and products in the first quarter. IBM spokesman John Bukovinsky said he did not have information showing where Wednesday's job cuts took place. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, is trying to boost profitability in services by replacing some employees with software that can be replicated from one contract to another. This year's job cuts occurred as customers shortened or otherwise cut services contracts, Bukovinsky said. "The services business is tremendously cyclical," he said. "This is basically the result of (clients) looking over longer-term contracts and deciding they don't want the work done, or deciding they can do the work with fewer people." Bukovinsky said the jobs were not being shifted to lower-cost labor markets such as India. IBM in the first quarter paid about $55 million for job cuts. (c) Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

May 31 2007: 6:09 AM EDT SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -- Yahoo Inc. Chief Technology Officer Farzad Nazem is retiring from the Web portal and search company after 11 years, effective June 8, the company and Nazem said. His departure leaves two key posts empty at ) after the company restructured last year to better compete with Web search leader Fortune's David Kirkpatrick sits down with CNNMoney's Jim Ledbetter to discuss the possibility of a Yahoo-Microsoft merger. Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang will oversee Yahoo's technology group until the company finds a replacement for Nazem, the company said Wednesday. Yahoo also is looking for someone to lead its products group. Nazem, 45, who joined Yahoo in early 1996, was made head of one of three groups as part of the company's restructuring in December. He was charged with developing the next advertising platform beyond Yahoo's Panama project, the company's upgraded Web advertising system targeting Google. Yahoo names new CFO Yahoo spokeswoman Helena Maus said Nazem's decision had nothing to do with Panama's performance - which analysts say has not had as significant an impact as hoped - and that he had been considering leaving for months. Nazem said in a blog post he decided to retire after 26 years in the technology industry, but did not want to do so until the introduction of Panama, which the company launched in February. Nazem will also receive his salary through the end of June and stock options granted in 2003, 2005 and 2006 will fully vest when he steps down. His right to exercise those options along with some granted in 1999 will extend for three years, Yahoo said in a regulatory filing. His annual salary for 2007 was about $500,000, according to a past Yahoo filing. "It was very important to me to drive all the way to my last day here at Yahoo without distractions of an announcement like this," he said. "So we chose to make the announcement and my end date as close as possible." Yahoo shares fell to $28.10 in extended trading from a close of $28.38 on Nasdaq.

The latest cuts -- combined with 3,500 announced in January -- will eliminate nearly 11 percent of the company's global workforce of 71,000. It is the biggest reduction since the dark period following the technology stock market's collapse in 2000, when Motorola shed about 40 percent of its workers. The latest round of cost cutting is expected to save $600 million annually, in addition to the $400 million in savings targeted in January, Chief Financial Officer Tom Meredith said Wednesday. "Long-term, sustainable profitability is -- and always has been -- Motorola's top priority," he said. Motorola's stock headed up on the news in after-hours trading after closing Wednesday at $18.28, down 2 cents per share from the previous day's close. President and Chief Operating Officer Gregory Brown said the company is taking steps to ensure that customer service, product quality and research and development programs won't suffer. But analysts said eliminating more jobs is not likely to help and may even hurt the company's fight to regain momentum in its key cell phone business. "It looks good on the surface but to get back in the game they need to come up with a very compelling phone platform very quick," said Charter Equity Research analyst Edward Snyder. "If you're not careful and judicious about where those cuts come from it could end up hurting more than helping." A Motorola spokeswoman said the cuts will be spread out among "all businesses, functions and regions." "We have made the very difficult decision to reduce our workforce by approximately 4,000 through normal attrition and some involuntary separations," she said. "At the same time it's important to note that we are continuing to hire top talent in critical areas." Motorola employed 66,000 at the end of last year but gained 5,000 with its acquisition this year of Symbol Technologies Inc., a maker of hand-held mobile computers. It employs about 15,000 in Ilinois Illinois, primarily in the Chicago area. The company has struggled since it slashed prices last year on its top-selling Razr to gain market share, turning the premium product into a commodity. Meanwhile, Motorola lagged in developing new high-end phones. "Essentially their employees are paying for the pricing misjudgments," said analyst Casey Ryan of Nollenberger Capital Partners. "Getting rid of employees doesn't really solve the problem. The company is going to need better products, not fewer people. "This seems like a good near-term fix to help &#091;profit&#093; margins, but it looks like it's probably going to hurt morale and be somewhat of a negative overall," Ryan said. Lawrence Harris of Oppenheimer & Co. said "you start to get diminishing returns" from job cuts. "Certainly cost controls are important but it's really the product portfolio -- having the right features at the right price" that matters, he said. "If you have a hot phone consumers will pay premium prices." A lot is riding on the phones Motorola is expected to announce in July for the holiday selling season, he said. ---------- berose@tribune.com mhughlett@tribune.com Chicago Bears Super Bowl coverage Wonders of the world 10 for the road Send a news tip What's in it for you?

Imperial Oil Ltd., about 70 percent owned by Exxon Mobil, in March raised its cost estimate for the Mackenzie Valley gas project to C$16.2 billion ($15.1 billion) from an October 2004 target of C$7.5 billion. ``At those costs, it&#39;s not viable to build that pipeline,&#39;&#39; Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson told reporters today after the Irving, Texas-based company held its annual shareholders meeting in Dallas. ``It may just be that this project will have to wait for a different cost environment.&#39;&#39; Calgary-based Imperial blamed more than half of the cost increase on surging steel prices and regulatory delays. ``The basic costs of commodities just shot past them,&#39;&#39; Tillerson said. ``It&#39;s not economical at this point.&#39;&#39; Soaring costs also may make the tapping of Alaskan gas fields too expensive to pursue, Tillerson said. Exxon Mobil and its partners in an Alaskan gas project estimated three years ago that building a pipeline to the North Slope would cost $22 billion to $25 billion. ``My expectation is if we went back and looked at the costs again, they would have gone up dramatically,&#39;&#39; Tillerson said. ``It involves lots of steel, lots of compressors, lots of valves, all the same things you need for the Canadian project.&#39;&#39; Imperial, Exxon Mobil and their partners in the Mackenzie project would need as much as C$2 billion in government aid or incentives such as accelerated depreciation to proceed, Chris Theal, an analyst at Tristone Capital Inc. in Calgary, said in a report last month. Plans in the 1970s to build a pipeline to tap Canada&#39;s northern gas reserves were halted by falling prices and concerns the development would disrupt the lives of aboriginals. A doubling in gas prices and an agreement for Indian groups to own a stake in the line helped revive the proposal this decade. In March, Imperial pushed back its target completion date for the pipeline to at least 2014, six years later than planned when the company applied for regulatory approval in 2004. The Mackenzie pipeline would carry about 1 billion cubic feet of gas a day from Canada&#39;s Northwest Territories and would span 1,220 kilometers (758 miles). It would connect to the North American pipeline grid in northern Alberta and supply enough gas for almost 10 percent of U.S. households. The pipeline also would open up the Northwest Territories and the Yukon to more petroleum exploration, said Robert Hunt, president of Calgary-based Horizon North Logistics Inc. The gas line would create a right-of-way through the Mackenzie River Valley that could be used to build a line that would haul crude from fields beneath the Arctic Ocean, Hunt said. Exxon Mobil and other energy producers have discovered more than 10 billion barrels of oil in North American arctic seas that remain stranded by a lack of pipelines, Hunt said. Besides Imperial and Exxon Mobil, partners in the Mackenzie project included Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, ConocoPhillips and the Aboriginal Pipeline Group, a company formed by Canadian Indian groups. In Alaska, state lawmakers on May 11 approved a plan by Governor Sarah Palin that gives companies incentives to build a pipeline to transport gas from the North Slope fields to the contiguous 48 states. The bill grants as much as $500 million in state funds for permitting costs and exempts gas shipped through the pipeline from production tax increases for 10 years. Exxon Mobil has said the bill&#39;s provisions are flawed. Shares of Exxon Mobil rose $1.38, or 1.7 percent, to $84 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has climbed 9.6 percent this year.

CTO is parting ways with the company effective immediately, according to an SEC filing this afternoon. The filing includes a copy of Nazem&#146;s separation agreement, which spells out that his involvement in the company actually ends today even though his termination date is June 8. Nazem joined the company in 1996 and became CTO in 1998. As part of the Yahoo! reorganization that led to the departure of COO Dan Rosensweig, Nazem was appointed to head technology, one of the three core units. , then CFO, was put in charge of the advertiser & publisher group while the job at the top of the third group, audience, has yet to be filled. Nazem recently reorganized the technology group; we posted his memo explaining the moves. Just last week, Nazem exercised options for 84,500 shares of stock at $24.75 and then sold them for $29.75 to $29.79 that day. Some of his remaining options will vest fully June 8 but the right to exercise his options following departure relies on his compliance, including an agreement not to engage in "certain competitive activities" for three years--i.e., no work in any way with )--and his agreement not to solicit any Yahoo! employees or contractors. (If he's with a company acquired by Google or Microsoft or is consulting in an area that didn't exist at Yahoo! as of June, 8, different story.) He'll get the remainder of his 2007 base pay in lieu of other severance. --He also agrees not to disparage Yahoo! for five years, and Yahoo! agrees that top execs, including his successor and the directors, will not disparage him. Nazem says he&#146;s retiring. From his post on Yahoo!'s blog, Yodel Anecdotal: "After spending the last 26 years in this fast-paced technology industry, I've finally decided it's time to slow down. I'll be retiring in early June. ... As I began contemplating retirement, there were a few milestones that I (along with the executive leadership team) wanted to accomplish prior to my departure. We wanted to realign the company and, subsequently, the Technology Group, successfully launch our new search monetization system (a.k.a. Panama) and build a solid technology leadership team to help take this company to the next level. It was very important to me to drive all the way to my last day here at Yahoo! without distractions of an announcement like this. So we chose to make the announcement and my end date as close as possible." --Jerry Yang will be the "interim executive sponsor of the Technology Group" until a permanent replacement is identified.

Nazem has definitely contributed to the online landscape as we know it, but honestly, I'm not too thrilled with what I've seen of Panama. I wouldn't go as far to say that he's the sole person to blame for Yahoo's perpetual need to play catchup, but perhaps some new blood and some relaxation should be in store for both Yahoo and Nazem respectively.

By midmorning, they were down $1.71, or 2 percent, to $82.69 on the New York Stock Exchange. Management during a conference call with analysts declined to take questions regarding the specific circumstances that led to Colby's ouster, but said no other employee resigned in connection with his departure.

Larry Glasscock, the company's current CEO and president, added that the action "in no way related to the CEO transition." Braly was named in late February to replace Glasscock, who is retiring.

"We don't have double standards at the company," Glasscock said, noting that Wellpoint's code of conduct applies to every employee. Another analyst asked if management expects to be sued as a result. Glasscock declined to answer the question, and simply said that Colby will do what he thinks is right "I believe we absolutely did the right thing based on where the facts led us," Glasscock added. Management said it has yet to name a new chief accounting officer to succeed DeVeydt in that position. analyst Matthew Borsch in a research note said, "While the CEO and CFO departures appear to be entirely unrelated, some uncertainty is likely to linger until investors are completely reassured that the departures have no bearing on the underlying fundamentals of the company as well as gain confidence in the new management team." "The stock is dead money between now and the third-quarter earnings report because you have this cloud of concern over it, with a new CEO and CFO who are untried and untested in these roles," said Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst who follows the industry for CRT Capital. Shares of Wellpoint, which reported that its membership rose about 2 percent to 34.9 million as of the end of March, have risen 7.25 percent year to date. They hit a record of $85.45 on May 17.

Colby, named the best health insurance CFO each of the past four years by Institutional Investor magazine, over unspecified violations of company rules. The conduct-code breaches were ``of a non-business nature&#39;&#39; and didn&#39;t involve illegality, WellPoint, the second-biggest U.S. health-insurance provider, said today in a statement. The company, based in Indianapolis, said its financial statements and forecasts are accurate. Colby, 53, left as Chief Executive Officer Larry C. Glasscock prepared to hand the top job at WellPoint to Angela F. Braly tomorrow. Colby was finance chief of WellPoint Health Networks Inc. in November 2004 when the company was bought by Anthem Inc. The acquirer took the name WellPoint and kept Colby as executive vice president and CFO. Wayne S. DeVeydt, 37, who was chief accounting officer, now succeeds Colby. ``We view Wayne as a solid choice to step into the CFO slot,&#39;&#39; said Justin Lake, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC in New York, in a note to investors today. ``That said, it will likely take the market some time to ingest the significant management turnover occurring at the company over the last several months.&#39;&#39; Colby didn&#39;t respond to an e-mail. A call placed to his office was forwarded to a spokeswoman. WellPoint shares fell $1.52, or 1.8 percent, to $82.88 at 10:23 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock had gained 18 percent in the 12 months through yesterday, underperforming a 27 percent increase in the six-member Standard & Poor&#39;s 500 Managed Care Index. UnitedHealth Group Inc., based in Minnetonka, Minnesota, is the largest U.S. medical insurance provider. An investigation of Colby&#39;s conduct by external legal counsel began in ``recent days,&#39;&#39; Glasscock said on a telephone call with investors and analysts. ``Certain concerns were raised, and we immediately began an investigation,&#39;&#39; Glasscock said. ``Based on this investigation, it was concluded that David Colby violated the company&#39;s code of conduct.&#39;&#39; WellPoint&#39;s code, available on the company&#39;s Web site, is a 25-page document that covers a variety of issues, including ethical decision-making, reporting of violations, protecting information, and maintaining the workplace environment. It sets limits on blogging and other Internet use; drugs and alcohol; possession of weapons; and political activity. Violating the code, or authorizing, failing to report, or failing to cooperate with an investigation of, a violation, can result in corrective action ``including termination of employment,&#39;&#39; the handbook says. Institutional Investor ranked Colby the top managed-care CFO in March, saying that investors ``credit Colby with helping to maintain stable financial results during the late 1990s, a tumultuous time for health insurers when public opinion of them plummeted. Many smaller companies went out of business or sought refuge in the arms of successful consolidators.&#39;&#39; The former finance chief was treated as any other employee would have been, Glasscock said. ``What&#39;s really important is that all of us read and agree to abide by the code of conduct,&#39;&#39; Glasscock said. ``We don&#39;t have double standards in the company. We have one set of standards that apply to everyone.&#39;&#39; Glasscock wouldn&#39;t say whether he thought Colby would sue the company for his dismissal. ``Obviously Dave Colby will make the decisions he thinks are appropriate for Dave Colby,&#39;&#39; Glasscock said. ``I believe we&#39;ve done absolutely the right thing based on where the facts led us.&#39;&#39; DeVeydt has been WellPoint&#39;s senior vice president and chief accounting officer since March 2005. He also assumed responsibility for investor relations and became chief of staff to Glasscock in 2006. Before joining WellPoint, DeVeydt served with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in many roles since 1996. ``While the circumstances we reported today are unfortunate, I&#39;m very pleased and honored to assume the role of chief financial officer,&#39;&#39; DeVeydt said on the telephone call. WellPoint announced Colby&#39;s latest recognition by Institutional Investor in a news release on Feb. 21. DeVeydt, in charge of investor relations, was listed as a contact person.

Lee Partners and the specialty insurer for $5.3 billion in cash. The deal values Ceridian at $36 a share, a 5.3 percent premium to its closing price of $34.19 yesterday. In after-hours trading, Ceridian rose $1.41, or 4 percent, to $35.60. Ceridian and its buyers noted, however, that Ceridian was trading at around $31 before Feb. 17, when the company announced that it was putting itself up for sale. The deal represents a 16 percent premium over that price, and a 56 percent premium to Ceridian&#8217;s price on Oct. 6, the day before Ceridian announced Kathryn V. Marinello&#8217;s appointment as chief executive. Last year, Ceridian reported earnings of $174 million, or $1.20 a share, so the merger values the company at 30 times its trailing earnings, compared with about 18 times earnings for the average company in the Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s 500-stock index. Ceridian&#8217;s human resource division offers payroll, tax and benefits services to 110,000 companies, with a combined 25 million employees, in 38 countries. The company also processes payments and issues credit and stored-value cards for the trucking and retail industries. In a statement announcing the deal, Thomas H. Lee and Fidelity said they planned to bring other investors into the transaction. Fidelity will own less than 50 percent of Ceridian at closing and for accounting purposes will not consolidate Ceridian&#8217;s results into its income statement. The transaction will be presented to Ceridian shareholders for approval at the company&#8217;s annual meeting, after the filing of proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ceridian said it would hold its annual meeting no later than Sept. 21.

The Chicago purchasing-managers' index rose to 61.7% in May from 52.9% in April, the Chicago NAPM reported. The size of the gain surprised analysts. Economists were expecting the Chicago PMI index to inch higher to 54.0%. Readings over 50% indicate that more firms were expanding than contracting. The report seems to dovetail with recent data that point to a modest recovery in manufacturing after a slow patch in the first quarter. Just how slow things were in the first quarter was revealed earlier on Thursday when the government revised down its estimate of first quarter growth to a paltry 0.6%, the slowest pace in four years. The Chicago PMI has been of interest chiefly because it was seen to provide hints as to the movement in the national Institute of Supply Management index, which will be released on Friday. But economists say the Chicago report has provided little information about the national index in the last few years. Before the Chicago index was released, economists are looking for the ISM to slip to 53.5% in May, after surging to 54.7% in April. In the Chicago report, the new orders index rose to 71.1% from 56.5% in the previous month. Production jumped to 69.8% from 62.2% in April. This was the highest level of production since April 2005. The employment index rose to 57.3% from 50.5%. The prices paid index rose to 70.2 from 64.9% in April. The Chicago index covers all types of firms, not just manufacturers. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.1% in April. In another report, the Labor Department said jobless claims fell slightly in the latest week. Greg Robb is a senior reporter for MarketWatch in Washington.

Assistant U.S. attorney Eric Sussman offered no explanation why he asked Judge Amy St. Eve for approval to drop the money-laundering charge, which was added to the indictment in December, 2005. Black, who is also a member of the House of Lords, was the only one among four co-defendants who was facing the charge. Former media mogul Conrad black arrives at federal court in Chicago, Wednesday, May 30, 2007, for his continuing racketeering and fraud trial. Black, 62, is charged with swindling the big Hollinger International newspaper holding company he headed out of $84 million. Photograph by : Charles Rex Arbogast/AP Email to a friend Edward Genson, a defence attorney representing Black, quipped, â€œOK, I guess I can goâ€ as the charge was dropped. The 16-member jury was not present and attorneys in the case were discussing issues related to the trial, including upcoming evidence. The U.S. government alleges Black and three other senior Hollinger International executives misappropriated $60 million US in bonuses disguised as non-compete payments from Hollinger International during the sale of newspaper assets. All have pleaded not guilty. The decision provided a bright spot for the defence before the jury arrived and prosecutors introduced a stack of documents found inside the 13 boxes that Black was videotaped removing from Hollinger Inc.â€™s office in Toronto into evidence. The boxes included receipts for purchases Black had made at a number of luxury stores, among them more than $116,000 US at Yves St. Laurent; $101,550 US at Fendi and $2.62 million US at Graff Diamonds Limited. Prosecutor Jeffrey Cramer also flashed bank statements showing a deposit made to Black for $4.3 million US from American Publishing Company on April 9, 2001, and travel documents from Tekura Tahiti Travel related to Blackâ€™s trip to Bora Bora. An original copy of a contract signed by Black was also shown to the jury. The contents of the battered office boxes, which have been sitting in front of the jurors on a trolley in the courtroom for days, had largely remained a mystery to them until Wednesday. The jury also saw an e-mail that Black sent to co-defendant Peter Atkinson on Jan. 17, 2003, referring to a public company as a â€œvehicle for extracting money, as in the non-competes.â€ After presenting the jury with the flurry of documents, Sussman announced, â€œAt this time, the prosecution rests.â€ After jurors filed out of the courtroom, Black and his wife, Barbara Amiel, left the room holding hands. The press baron had a faint smile on his lips. Black is facing an additional charge of obstruction of justice, which is directly linked to the removal of the boxes. After the jurors had left for the day, Marc Martin, a defence lawyer for Black, applied to St. Eve to have all of the charges against the press baron dismissed. He took particular exception with the obstruction of justice charge, arguing that were it not for an Ontario court order that prevented the removal of documents from Hollinger Inc. in May 20005, the charge would have no basis. â€œWe donâ€™t know what Mr. Blackâ€™s intention was,â€ Martin argued, pointing out that the press baron had been ordered to vacate the office by the end of the month. Sussman argued the charge is also directly relevant to investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a grand jury, as well as the federal court proceedings in Chicago. Lawyers for Blackâ€™s co-defendants also applied to have various charges against their clients dismissed. The defence will begin presenting its case today. The first witness expected to be called is call Joan Maida, Blackâ€™s personal assistant in Toronto, as its first witness on Thursday. Ken Whyte, the editor of Macleanâ€™s magazine, who has selected by Black to launch the National Post, will also take the stand. Defence attorneys have indicated their case will not be lengthy and will likely wrap up in the second week of June. Edward Greenspan, a Canadian lawyer representing Black, told St. Eve that he had intended to call a parole lawyer from British Columbia to explain the sentence that David Radler, Blackâ€™s former lieutenant in Canada, could be expected to serve in Canada after signing his so-called â€œsweetheart dealâ€ with prosecutors in exchange for his testimony and a lenient 29-month sentence. But Greenspan said that when he called the provinceâ€™s leading lawyer, who he did not name, he was informed the lawyer was already working for Radler. That lawyer, however, could still end up testifying about his relationship with Radler at the criminal trial in Chicago. Radler previously testified that he was unaware of that he could spend as little as six months in prison under Canadian laws. He has indicated he would like to serve his sentence in British Columbia, near his home.

May 30 2007: 1:47 PM EDT NEW YORK (Reuters) -- The American Civil Liberties Union is suing a unit of Boeing Co., charging that it assisted the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency in abducting suspect foreigners to overseas prisons where it says they were held and tortured. The ACLU said it would file a lawsuit against (up $1.15 to $99.65, ) unit Jeppesen Dataplan Inc. later on Wednesday, accusing the company of providing flight and logistical support to at least 15 aircraft on 70 so-called "rendition" flights. Boeing CFO James Bell talks with Fortune's Geoffrey Colvin about what it takes to handle high risk projects that put the company in peril. The suit, to be filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, is being made on behalf of three people the ACLU said had been abducted by the CIA. "American corporations should not be profiting from a CIA rendition program that is unlawful and contrary to core American values," Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, said in a statement. "Corporations that choose to participate in such activity can and should be held legally accountable." At least 1,245 CIA flights were made into or over Europe in the four years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, a European Parliament report said earlier this year. Washington acknowledges the secret transfer of suspects to third countries but denies torturing them or handing them over to countries that did. A Jeppesen representative declined to comment on the suit, and would not say whether the CIA was a customer of the company. According to the ACLU, Jeppesen played a key role in what it called the U.S. government's rendition program, providing aircraft crew with itineraries, preparing flight plans, procuring landing permits from foreign governments and helping with customs clearance and ground transportation. "Without the participation of companies like Jeppesen, the program could not have gotten off the ground," Steven Watt, a staff attorney for the ACLU's Human Rights Program, said in a statement. The suit is being brought on behalf of Binyam Mohamed, Abou Elkassim Britel and Ahmed Agiza, three foreign nationals whom the ACLU said were abducted and moved to secret overseas locations where they were tortured. The suit claims Jeppesen knew the purpose of the rendition flights. It is to be filed under the Alien Tort Statute, which permits foreigners to bring claims in the United States for violations of the law of nations or a United States treaty. The ACLU also said on Wednesday that it would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the dismissal of a lawsuit against former CIA Director George Tenet and 10 CIA employees by a German who says he was kidnapped and tortured by the spy agency about three years ago. In March, a U.S. appeals court upheld the dismissal of the suit, brought by Khaled el-Masri, a German of Lebanese origin, after agreeing with U.S. government arguments that moving forward with the case would pose a risk of exposing state secrets. El-Masri was arrested in Macedonia in late 2003 and says he was handed over to the CIA, who flew him to Afghanistan and wrongly held him until his release in May 2004.

US economy slows to crawl, but some see rebound Washington, May 31: The US economy slowed to a 0.6 percent growth pace in the first quarter of 2007, the weakest in over four years, the government said Thursday in a revision for the January-March period. But even though the world's largest economy appeared to sputter, many analysts said the report reflected the low point for the year and that there are already signs of a rebound. Gross domestic product ( GDP) was revised down from last month's estimate of 1.3 percent and was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 2002, the Commerce Department report showed. The figure was below the 0.8 percent growth pace forecast by most Wall Street analysts and came after a 2.5 percent expansion in the fourth quarter of 2006. Many economists said details of the report validate the view of the Federal Reserve that growth would pick up over the course of 2007. "The cloud on first-quarter growth is the silver lining for the second quarter," said Drew Matus, senior economist at Lehman Brothers. "I think we'll see second-quarter growth above three percent and 2.5 percent for all of 2007." Matus and others said consumer spending was better than expected and that inventories had been brought to a low point, requiring factories to ramp up production. "GDP was revised a little more than expected but a lot had to do with a huge downward adjustment in inventories which actually sets things up for a good gain in production in the second quarter and raises optimism for the economic outlook," noted Sal Guatieri at BMO Financial Group. The Commerce Department said the latest revision came as a result of a bigger-than-expected trade deficit, which meant more goods consumed in the United States were produced abroad. Real estate remained the main drag on economic growth, but the decline was a bit less than earlier estimated. Spending on residential investment fell 15.4 percent, instead of an earlier estimate of 17 percent. Consumer spending was the main driver of growth, increasing 4.4 percent, up from the earlier estimate of 3.8 percent. This is seen as a key because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of US economic activity. Business investment was better than earlier estimates, growing 2.9 percent, revised up from 2.0 percent. An inflation indicator linked to GDP showed a 3.3 percent gain in prices, down from an earlier estimate of 3.4 percent. Core prices, excluding food and energy, were up an unrevised 2.2 percent. The Commerce Department will make its second and final revision to GDP next month. Scott Anderson, economist at Wells Fargo, said he expected a shift in the growth picture after a first quarter that was "almost all driven by consumer spending." "We think consumers will take a bit of a breather, with growth at about two percent, but that will be made up by other factors," including increased exports and factory activity, he noted. Even though some analysts have predicted the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates to stimulate flagging growth, the central bank has stated that inflation is its primary concern and has not ruled out future rate hikes. In minutes released Wednesday, Fed members said they expected a pickup in activity. If this acceleration occurs, this will put the economy closer to a sustainable rate of around three percent and "it will complicate the Fed's job, with inflation being sticky," said Matus. *Your friend's e-mail address: Libya announces USD 900 mn gas deal with BP Bush picks Zoellick as new World Bank chief US risks budget crisis over health-care costs: OECD French President threatens to veto WTO farm talks Yahoo!

The feed ingredients were made by Tembec BTLSR Inc. of Toledo, Ohio and Uniscope, Inc. of Johnstown, Colo. Tembec, a contract manufacturer for Uniscope, makes AquaBond and Aqua-Tec II, which it distributes for Uniscope. Uniscope makes Xtra-Bond using ingredients supplied by Tembec. All of the products are binding agents that are used to make pelleted feed for cattle, sheep, and goats, or fish and shrimp. The companies have confirmed that Tembec added melamine as part of the formulation of the products to improve the binding properties of pelleted feed. Melamine is not approved as an additive for animal or fish/shrimp feed. The companies have stopped adding melamine to the feed products. Based on the levels of melamine and related compounds in the initial ingredients, FDA estimated the probable level of melamine and related compounds in livestock feed as less than 50 parts per million (ppm) based on the recommended mix rate of two to four pounds of binding agent per ton of livestock feed. The estimated levels in fish and shrimp feed are less than 233 ppm and 465 ppm, respectively, of melamine and related compounds. The estimated levels of melamine and related compounds vary in the livestock feed and the fish and shrimp feed because of differing levels of melamine in the binding agents used for each type of feed. FDA advises feed manufacturers and others who mix their own feed not to use these products, and to contact the manufacturers. FDA advises feed manufacturers to recall finished feed that is made from AquaBond or Aqua-Tec II due to the estimated levels of melamine and related compounds in the finished products. FDA believes that no recall is warranted of the finished feed made from Xtra-Bond based on the estimated levels of melamine and related compounds in the finished product and based on currently available data and information. The estimated melamine levels in feed made with these binding agents are similar to the levels discussed in the interim safety/risk assessment of melamine and related compounds made available by FDA earlier this month. In that assessment, federal scientists determined that, based on currently available data and information, the consumption of pork, chicken, domestic fish, and eggs from animals inadvertently fed animal feed contaminated with melamine and its analogues is very unlikely to pose a human health risk. The interim safety/risk assessment concludes that in the most extreme risk assessment scenario, when scientists assumed that all the solid food a person consumes in an entire day contained melamine and the melamine compound cyanuric acid in equal amounts, the potential exposure is about 250 times lower than the dose considered safe. This is a large safety margin. Translated to consumption levels, this means that a person weighing 132 pounds would have to eat more than 800 pounds per day of food containing melamine and its compounds to approach a level of consumption that would cause a health concern. FDA is encouraging domestic feed suppliers to be vigilant in quality control in their supply chain and to monitor for any improper additives, including melamine and its analogs. The Tembec and Uniscope products also reportedly contain a urea formaldehyde resin-type ingredient, a raw ingredient used to make the binding agent in these products. FDA is investigating this use of the urea formaldehyde resin-type ingredient in the Tembec and Uniscope products, and will take appropriate regulatory action if warranted.

If the vessel was Spanish or was removed from that country's waters, any treasure would belong to Spain, said James Goold, an attorney representing the government. "It's a very well established principle under Spanish, U.S. and international law that a government such as the kingdom of Spain has not abandoned its sunken ships or sunken property, and that a company like Odyssey Marine Exploration may not conduct recovery operations without authorization by the government," he said. "The kingdom of Spain has not authorized any such operations by Odyssey, and by these legal actions it will see the return of any Spanish property Odyssey has recovered," Goold said of the claims filed Wednesday. Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. co-founder Greg Stemm said Thursday the company was working on a statement in response to Spain's claims. He has previously called Spain's legal threats "absurd" and said that Odyssey would notify all claimants once it conclusively determined the ship's identity. The company announced two weeks ago that it had discovered a shipwreck containing 500,000 gold and silver coins somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. The Tampa-based company said the site was outside any country's territorial waters but would not give the exact location or name of the ship. Odyssey has said that the ship was not in Spanish territorial waters and was not the HMS Sussex, a shipwreck that Odyssey recently got permission from the Spanish government to search for in the Strait of Gibraltar. But Spain has called the new discovery suspicious and said the booty may have come from a wrecked Spanish galleon. In Britain, the find generated press reports that Odyssey had salvaged the wreck of the long-sought British vessel Merchant Royal, which sank in bad weather off England in 1641. Odyssey has not confirmed or denied these reports. Spain is using the U.S. law firm Covington & Burling, which has represented Spain over shipwreck cases before, including the recovery of material from two ships, Juno and La Galga, in a 2000 court case. The Spanish government won the case at that time. Associated Press writers Jennifer Kay in Miami and Mar Roman in Madrid, Spain, contributed to this report.

AUGSTUMS 05.31.07, 8:27 AM ET said Thursday it would acquire A.G. Edwards Inc. for $6.8 billion in cash and stock in a deal to form one of the largest retail stock brokerages in the United States. The combined entity will operate as Wachovia ) Securities, headquartered in St. Louis, and will have more than 3,300 brokerage locations nationwide, more than $1.1 trillion in client assets, and nearly 15,000 financial advisers. Other A.G. Edwards businesses, including research, underwriting, investment banking, mutual funds and trust, will be consolidated into Wachovia's existing operating lines. Wachovia said A.G. Edwards shareholders would get 0.9844 Wachovia shares and $35.80 in cash for each A.G. Edwards share held. That offer values A.G. Edwards at $89.50 per share based on Wednesday's closing prices, a 16 percent premium. "The long-term growth opportunities of the brokerage industry are extremely compelling to Wachovia, and we have long expressed our interest in growing this business both organically and through acquisition," Ken Thompson, Wachovia's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. The deal continues a string of high-profile acquisitions engineered by Charlotte, N.C.-based Wachovia, including First Union, Prudential Securities and, most recently, Golden West Financial Corp. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2007, with full integration by early 2009. Wachovia said Daniel J. Ludeman, currently president and chief executive of its Wachovia Securities unit, will keep those roles at the combined brokerage unit. A.G. Edwards Chairman and CEO Robert Bagby will be chairman of the brokerage. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The suit " > Share the news you witness with Reuters and the world.

The suit does not refer specifically to Odyssey's claim on May 18 that it had legally recovered gold and silver coins worth an estimated $500 million from a colonial-era wreck code-named "Black Swan" at an undisclosed location in the Atlantic Ocean. But Spain's Culture Ministry has called that discovery -- one of the world's biggest finds of sunken treasure -- suspicious and said the booty may have come from a wrecked Spanish galleon. "The Kingdom of Spain has not abandoned its ownership and other rights in sunken vessels of the Kingdom of Spain, in vessels sunk while in the service of the Kingdom of Spain, and in cargo or other property of the Kingdom of Spain on or in sunken vessels," said the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. "All sovereign and other rights in such vessels, cargo, artifacts or other contents have been reserved," it said. "The Kingdom of Spain further affirms and restates that arrest, recovery, or other unauthorized disturbance or recovery by Odyssey Marine Exploration of property of the Kingdom of Spain is not authorized, and the Kingdom of Spain reserves all rights and remedies arising from such activities." A spokesman for Tampa-based Odyssey could not be reached for immediate comment on the suit, which was filed on Spain's behalf by Washington-based attorney James Goold. But the company has said that the "Black Swan" recovery mission did not fall under Spanish jurisdiction. Goold said Wednesday's suit was one of three the Spanish government was filing against Odyssey aimed at blocking its claims to various shipwrecks, including the "Black Swan." &copy; Reuters 2007.

March 13, 2007 in Owasso, Oklahoma. Kornegay is in the midst of the spring calving season when he normally doubles the feed for his cattle. But rising corn prices have forced him to cut feed by half. &#40;Brandi Simons/ Getty Images&#41; By Lisa Richwine and Christopher Doering WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two companies are recalling livestock and fish feed ingredients because they contain the same chemical linked to the deaths of cats and dogs from tainted pet food, U.S. health officials said on Wednesday. The presence of melamine and related compounds in feed ingredients sold by Uniscope Inc. and a unit of Tembec Inc. was unrelated to the pet food contamination by ingredients from China, the Food and Drug Administration said. Officials said Tembec confirmed it intentionally added melamine to improve the binding properties of ingredients used to make feed pellets. Melamine is not an approved feed additive. Investigators are unsure how many animals may have consumed tainted feed. Officials said melamine levels were low and it was unlikely humans would be harmed. "The companies have stopped adding melamine to the feed product," Dr. David Acheson, FDA assistant commissioner for food protection, told reporters. "FDA is advising feed manufacturers and others who mix their own feed not to use these products, and to contact the manufacturers." Acheson said Ohio-based Tembec BTLSR, a unit of the Canadian wood products company Tembec, recalled AquaBond and Aqua-Tec II feed ingredients, which it distributes for Uniscope. Colorado-based Uniscope also recalled its Xtra-Bond product that was made with ingredients supplied by Tembec. The products are binding agents used to make feed pellets for cattle, sheep, goats, fish and shrimp. Tembec said it was cooperating with the FDA. "We discontinued the use of melamine in our formulation earlier this spring," Tembec executive vice president John Valley said, adding "we're talking about a low concentration of an element that is in turn a low component of any feed product." Uniscope originally notified the FDA about the contamination on May 18, agency officials said. "We don't think the concentration is very high," said Charlie Russell, a spokesman for Uniscope. "But if FDA thinks it's a big deal I'm not sure we're going to disagree with it."

In an indictment filed in U.S. district court in Manhattan, prosecutors allege the defendants at the "Big Four" accounting firm created and marketed tax shelters from 1998 through 2004 based on false and fraudulent scenarios to allow wealthy individuals to reduce the federal taxes they would have to pay. The Ernst & Young current or former partners named in the case are Robert Coplan, Martin Nissenbaum, Richard Shapiro and Brian Vaughn. A lawyer for Shapiro, John Tigue, said he has cooperated with the government for the last five years. "He intends to vigorously defend himself," Tigue said in a statement. Brian Linder, a lawyer for Nissenbaum, said in a statement that his client has entered a plea of "not guilty." "We have provided them (The U.S. attorney's office) over the past year with evidence that Mr. Nissenbaum did not engage in any unlawful activity," Linder said. Lawyers for Coplan and Vaughn could not be immediately reached for comment. Prosecutors allege that the four defendants schemed to defraud the IRS by deceiving the IRS about tax shelters that were marketed and sold to clients with taxable income, generally higher than $10 or $20 million. The indictment also charges that Coplan, Nissenbaum and Shapiro implemented tax shelters in 2000 to evade their own taxes, and arranged for eight other Ernst & Young partners to participate in that transaction, evading $3.7 million in taxes. Ernst & Young has made changes to its tax practice since the transactions in question, the accounting firm said. "The individuals who were indicted are two former partners and two partners who have been on administrative leave," Ernst & Young spokesman Charles Perkins said in a statement. "They were part of a small group within the firm, disbanded years ago,.... Ernst & Young has cooperated with the government from the beginning of its investigation, and we will continue to do so." Rival "Big Four" accounting firm KPMG has also been under scrutiny for tax shelters. In 2005, KPMG agreed to pay $456 million, accept an outside monitor and admit to wrongdoing to resolve a federal investigation into questionable tax shelters it sold to wealthy individuals. Sixteen of the KPMG's former employees are due to face trial over the shelters in September. (Additional reporting by Martha Graybow) (c) Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

The test of 626 volunteers with the kidney cancer compared the drug, also known as Torisel, with standard treatment using interferon alfa, along with a combination of both medicines. The combination turned out to be no better than interferon alfa alone. Average survival times were 7.3 months with interferon alfa and 8.4 months with the combination, which is not a significant difference. But with temsirolimus alone, the median survival time was 10.9 months. The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Food and Drug Administration made it the third such therapy approved since late 2005 for renal-cell carcinoma, the most common form of kidney cancer. In December 2005, the FDA cleared Bayer's Nexavar, or sorafenib. In January 2006, Pfizer Inc.'s Sutent, or sunitinib, also won approval. Nearly 39,000 people are diagnosed in the United States with renal-cell carcinoma each year. Once the tumor has spread -- as it does in about one third of the patients -- there is usually no cure. &copy; Reuters 2007.

The latest job cuts, due to be implemented by the end of the year, come on top of an earlier 3,500 job reduction designed to generate annual savings of $400m. Taken together, the move will reduce Motorola's global workforce, which stood at 66,000 at the end of 2006, by more than 11 per cent and underscores the determination of Ed Zander, Motorola's chief executive, and his senior management team to cut costs and get Motorola back on track. Motorola, which reported a first-quarter loss after its strategy to lift market share fell apart and margins collapsed, said it expected restructuring charges of about $300m, or about 8 cents per share, over the rest of 2007 as a result of the additional job cuts. The company, which said it was on track to complete the previously announced job cuts by June 30, forecast an additional $600m in annual cost savings next year as a result of the extra job cuts and other moves including spending controls and site rationalisation. "Long-term, sustainable profitability is â€“ and always has been â€“ Motorola's top priority," said Tom Meredith, chief financial officer. "We are confident the steps we are announcing today, together with the actions we have outlined previously, will further improve the company's financial and operational performance." The news came as Motorola revealed that Carl Icahn, the billionaire Wall Street investor who launched a proxy battle this year for a board seat after building up a 2.9 per cent stake in the company, won 717.7m votes compared with 931.7m cast in favour of the board's preferred candidate.

The National Association of Purchasing Management in Chicago is considered an early read on business conditions nationally. The monthly index, which covers services as well as manufacturing, is expected to rise to 54 from April's 52.9 reading, according to a median forecast of economists surveyed by Thomson Financial. The index will be released at 9:45 a.m. Thursday. Last month's reading of 52.9 was down from a two-year high of 61.7 in March. The drop was due to a dramatic slowdown in new orders and a decline in employment for the fourth month out of the previous five, among other factors, the April survey said. The index is seen as a precursor of the results from a nationwide survey of manufacturing activity conducted by the Institute for Supply Management, formerly the National Association of Purchasing Managers. The Chicago group is an affiliate of the ISM, which represents purchasing executives nationwide. Some analysts, however, argue that the Chicago survey has become less predictive of the ISM manufacturing report. According to analysts at Thomson Financial's IFR Markets, while there was a 92.5 percent correlation between the two indices from January 2000 to August 2004, that has weakened to 55.1 percent since the start of 2006.

Colby, this morning. â€œI fully expect the rest of our executive leadership team to remain together,â€ WellPoint General Counsel Angela F. Braly told stock analysts today. Braly is set to become CEO of the Indianapolis health insurer tomorrow, replacing long-time chief Larry C. Glasscock. WellPoint announced this morning that Colby was fired for violating the companyâ€™s code of conduct, but did not reveal the violation. Asked by analysts if WellPoint expected to be sued by Colby, Glasscock said, â€œObviously, Dave Colby will make the decisions that he thinks are appropriate for Dave Colby. But I believe weâ€™ve done absolutely the right things based on where the facts led us.â€ WellPoint shares were down $1.62, or 1.9 percent, in morning trading. Analysts said the recent turnover of the health insurerâ€™s CEO and CFO positions are unnerving investors. â€œComing on the heels of the unexpected CEO resignation earlier this year and the very-high profile role that the CFO has played with Wall Street over the years, we believe [Colbyâ€™s resignation is] likely to create considerable uncertainty in the stock over the coming months,â€ Bear Stearns analyst John Rex wrote in a note to investors this morning.

Our quarterly results included the net favorable impact of certain significant items as described in the "Significant Items" section below. Excluding these items, earnings per diluted share were $1.10 for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as compared to $1.11 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. For the quarter, improved operating results at Sears Canada and lower expenses at Sears Domestic were offset by reduced operating results at Kmart, where a decline in sales resulted in reduced gross margin dollars. "In part, our domestic operating results reflect the impact of some of the same challenges being faced by our customers, such as rising energy costs and a slower housing market," said Aylwin Lewis, Sears Holdings' chief executive officer and president. "However, as an organization, we need to overcome these factors by better controlling costs and developing innovative solutions that better meet our customers' needs and allow us to generate a more reasonable level of profitability even in the face of such challenges." A reconciliation of earnings per share excluding the above-noted significant items (a non-GAAP measure) to GAAP diluted earnings per share is set forth below. In addition, earnings per diluted share for the quarter benefited from lower average diluted shares outstanding during the current year quarter as compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2006. First Quarter Revenues and Comparable Store Sales Domestic comparable store sales declined 3.9% during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Sears Domestic comparable store sales declined 3.4% for the quarter, while Kmart comparable store sales declined 4.4%. We believe these declines reflect both increased competition and the impact of external factors such as rising energy costs, a slower housing market and poor weather conditions during the latter part of the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Kmart experienced lower transaction volumes across most merchandise categories, most notably within home goods, health and beauty products, and food and consumables. Similarly, Sears Domestic recorded comparable store sales declines across most merchandise categories and formats, with a notable decline in home appliance sales, which we believe reflects both a slower U.S. housing market and the impact of increased competition. Our fiscal 2007 first quarter was comprised of the 13-week period ended May 5, 2007, while our fiscal 2006 first quarter was comprised of the 13-week period ended April 29, 2006. This week shift in sales, while having a somewhat favorable impact on total revenues recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2006, had no impact on the comparable store sales results reported herein. This is due to the fact that, for purposes of reporting comparable sales for the first quarter, weeks 1 through 13 of fiscal 2007 have been compared to weeks 2 through 14 of fiscal 2006, thereby eliminating the impact of the week shift. For the quarter, total revenues declined $0.3 billion, or 2.5%, to $11.7 billion in fiscal 2007, as compared to $12.0 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. This decline reflects the above-noted impact of lower comparable store sales partially offset by sales increases within both our Lands' End and home services businesses. In addition, the week shift in reporting as detailed above had a favorable impact on total revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2007, by approximately 0.5%. The largest sales decline for the quarter was recorded at Kmart, where revenues declined $239 million, or 5.6%, primarily as a result of the above-noted comparable store sales declines, as well as a decrease in the total number of Kmart stores in operation. For the quarter, our operating income increased $62 million to $393 million in fiscal 2007, as compared to $331 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. This increase primarily reflects: 1) a gain of $30 million for a legal settlement reached in connection with a contractual dispute, 2) a $27 million curtailment gain recorded for amendments made by Sears Canada to its post-retirement benefit plans, and 3) a $15 million gain for insurance recoveries received on claims filed for certain of our property damaged by hurricanes during fiscal 2005. The favorable impact of these items, as well as improved operating results at Sears Canada and lower expenses at Sears Domestic, were partly offset by lower operating income at Kmart. As noted above, a number of items significantly impacted our fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 first quarter diluted earnings per share. While these types of items periodically affect our results, they vary significantly in amount from period to period, and had a disproportionate effect on our results for the periods presented. Management considers the total impact of these items, along with reported results, when it reviews and evaluates our financial performance. The impact of these items on diluted earnings per share is shown in the following table: 13 Weeks Ended May 5, April 29, 2007 2006 Earnings per diluted share $1.40 $1.14 Legal settlement gain 0.12 -- Sears Canada post-retirement benefit plans curtailment gain 0.11 -- Hurricane related recoveries 0.06 -- Dividend -- investment in Sears Mexico 0.08 -- Total return swap losses (0.08) -- Gain on sales of assets 0.01 0.06 Restructuring charges -- (0.03) Earnings per diluted share excluding above items $1.10 $1.11 During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we recognized: 1) a $30 million gain ($18 million after tax or $0.12 per diluted share) related to the legal settlement of a contractual dispute, 2) a curtailment gain of $27 million ($16 million after tax or $0.11 per diluted share) related to certain amendments made to Sears Canada's post-retirement benefit plans, 3) a gain of $15 million ($9 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share) for insurance recoveries received on claims filed for certain of our property damaged by hurricanes during fiscal 2005, and 4) a $20 million ($12 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) dividend we received on our investment in Sears Mexico. These gains were partially offset by investment losses of $21 million ($13 million after tax or $0.08 per diluted share) incurred during the quarter on our total return swap investments. In addition, the first quarter of fiscal 2007 included $5 million ($2 million after tax or $0.01 per diluted share) of gains on sales of assets, as compared to $17 million ($10 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share) of such gains in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The first quarter of fiscal 2006 also included restructuring charges of $9 million ($5 million after tax or $0.03 per diluted share). There were no restructuring charges in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We had cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 billion at May 5, 2007 (of which $3.1 billion is domestic and $0.3 billion is at Sears Canada) as compared to $3.2 billion at April 29, 2006 and $4.0 billion at February 3, 2007. The decline from February 3, 2007 primarily reflects increased merchandise inventories given seasonal shifts in our inventory levels in support of the spring/summer-selling season. Additionally, we spent $113 million on capital expenditures and made debt repayments of $47 million, net of new borrowings, during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Merchandise inventories at May 5, 2007 were approximately $10.3 billion, as compared to $9.6 billion at April 29, 2006. The increase primarily reflects planned increases resulting from efforts aimed at improving in-stock levels and expanding product assortments this year as well as, acquisition of previously consigned pharmacy inventory at Kmart, earlier receipt of products and lower than forecast sales levels. Merchandise payables were $3.5 billion at May 5, 2007, as compared to $3.6 billion as of April 29, 2006. During the first quarter of 2007, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock through our share repurchase program, although we received approximately 114,000 shares of our common stock during the quarter in connection with bankruptcy-related settlements. As of May 5, 2007, we had remaining authorization to repurchase $604 million of common shares under our existing share repurchase program. The remaining shares may be purchased in the open market, through self-tender offers or through privately negotiated transactions. Timing will depend on prevailing market conditions, alternative uses of capital and other factors. For purposes of evaluating operating performance, our management uses an Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") measurement computed as operating income appearing on the statement of income less depreciation and amortization and gains/(losses) on sales of assets. In addition, it is adjusted to exclude certain nonrecurring gains and restructuring charges. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses for comparable periods. Adjusted EBITDA should not be used by investors or other third parties as the sole basis for formulating investment decisions as it excludes a number of important cash and non-cash recurring items. Management compensates for this limitation by using GAAP financial measures as well in managing our businesses. While Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement, management believes that it is an important indicator of operating performance because: -- EBITDA excludes the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest and depreciation costs; -- Management considers gains/(losses) on the sale of assets to result from investing decisions rather than ongoing operations; and -- Restructuring activities and other significant items as described above, while periodically affecting our results, may vary significantly from period to period and have a disproportionate effect in a given period, which affects the comparability of results; Adjusted EBITDA was determined as follows: 13 Weeks Ended millions May 5, April 29, 2007 2006 Operating income per statement of income $393 $331 Plus depreciation and amortization 263 289 Less gain on sale of assets (5) (17) Before excluded items 651 603 Legal settlement gain (30) -- Sears Canada post-retirement benefit plans curtailment gain (27) -- Hurricane related recoveries (15) -- Restructuring charges -- 9 Adjusted EBITDA as defined $579 $612 % to revenues 4.9% 5.1% Adjusted EBITDA for our domestic (United States operations) and Sears Canada operations are as follows: millions 13 Weeks Ended Adjusted EBITDA % To Revenues May 5, April 29, May 5, April 29, 2007 2006 2007 2006 Domestic operations $528 $574 4.9% 5.2% Sears Canada 51 38 5.0% 3.6% Total Adjusted EBITDA $579 $612 4.9% 5.1% Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q We plan to file with the SEC our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter 2007 on or about June 1, 2007.

Consensus: ! 1Q 1Q 4Q ! +0.8% ! Overall GDP Growth +0.6% +1.3% +2.5% ! Actual: ! PCE Price Index +3.3% +3.4% -1.0% ! +0.6% ! =============================================================== Gross domestic product rose at a seasonally adjusted 0.6% annual rate January through March, the Commerce Department said in a new, revised estimate of first-quarter GDP. It was the weakest performance since a 0.2% increase in fourth-quarter 2002 GDP. Originally, the government had estimated first-quarter 2007 GDP rose 1.3%. Fourth-quarter 2006 GDP climbed 2.5%. Corporate profits got a bit stronger in the first three months of 2007. Profits after taxes grew by 1.0% to $1.184 trillion in the first quarter, after rising by 0.8% in the fourth quarter. Year over year, profits increased 6.4%. Price inflation gauges were barely touched in the government's revisions to the economic data. The economy's engine, consumer spending, was revised higher, but bigger imports and a drawdown by businesses in inventories led to a sharp downward revision to GDP, a measure of all goods and services produced in the economy. Wall Street was a little surprised by the size of the adjustment; the median estimate of 24 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires was a 0.8% increase. The report showed businesses decreased inventories in the first quarter, a decline of $4.5 billion. Originally, Commerce estimated a $14.8 billion increase. Companies had elevated stocks $22.4 billion in the fourth quarter. The drawdown of goods in the first quarter reduced GDP during that period by 0.98 percentage point. In its original report on first-quarter GDP, Commerce said inventories subtracted 0.30 percentage point from growth. Trade took a bigger bite out of the economy than first estimated - because U.S. imports were stronger, rising 5.7% instead of the originally reported 2.3%. Exports were revised higher, falling 0.6% instead of 1.2%. Trade cut GDP by 1.00 percentage points in the first quarter. Originally, trade was seen reducing GDP by 0.52 percentage point. Businesses increased spending more than previously thought. Outlays rose by 2.9% January through March, an advance bigger than the originally estimated 2.0% increase. Business spending fell 3.1% in the fourth quarter. First-quarter investment in structures increased 5.1%. Equipment and software rose 2.0%. First-quarter spending by consumers advanced 4.4%, up from a previously reported 3.8% increase and above the fourth quarter's 4.2% climb. Consumer spending accounts for about 70% of economic activity. It contributed 3.01 percentage points to GDP in the first quarter; the original estimate was a contribution of 2.66 percentage points. Purchases of durable goods surged 8.8% in January through March, above the previously reported 7.3% increase and double the rate of 4.4% in the fourth quarter. Durable goods are expensive items designed to last at least three years, such as refrigerators. First-quarter non-durables spending rose by 3.5%. Services spending went 4.0% higher. Residential fixed investment, which includes spending on housing, plunged by 15.4% in the first quarter, a smaller drop than the originally estimated 17.0%. Fourth-quarter spending fell by 19.8%. Real final sales of domestic product, which is GDP less the change in private inventories, climbed an unrevised 1.6%. Fourth-quarter sales rose 3.7%. Federal government spending decreased by 3.9%, revised down from an initially estimated 3.0% decline. Fourth-quarter spending rose 4.6%. State and local government outlays rose 3.9%. Revisions to inflation gauges within the report were generally left alone. The government's price index for personal consumption increased 3.3%, below the previously estimated 3.4% advance but above the fourth quarter's 1.0% decrease. The PCE price gauge excluding food and energy rose an unrevised 2.2%, above the fourth quarter's 1.8% increase. The price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices paid by U.S. residents, went up an unchanged 3.6%, which was above the fourth quarter's 0.2% increase. The chain-weighted GDP rose an unrevised 4.0%, above the fourth quarter's 1.7% increase. Copyright C2003, Dow Jones and Company, Inc.

Edwards Chances of Fed Rate Cut Diminish U.S. Firms' Use of Chemical Could Change China Debate HONG KONG -- The use of a potentially dangerous chemical as an animal feed additive by a pair of U.S. companies could shift the terms of a debate now playing out over China's regulation of its food production and exports. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Wednesday said it has alerted manufacturers of feed for livestock, fish and shrimp to a voluntary recall of products made by Tembec BTLSR Inc. of Toledo, Ohio. The FDA said Tembec had added melamine, an agent used in plastics and fire retardants but unfit for use in food, to animal feed agents to improve the product's texture. The FDA said Tembec is a contract manufacturer for another company, Uniscope Inc. of Johnstown, Colo. The FDA said that small amounts of melamine detected in the feed products suggest that the "consumption of pork, chicken, domestic fish and eggs from animals inadvertently fed animal feed contaminated with melamine and its analogues is very unlikely to pose a human health risk." China Refuses Shipment of Evian But the agency said the products made by Tembec and Uniscope also reportedly contained "a urea formaldehyde resin-type ingredient," a raw ingredient used to make the binding agent in these products. The FDA says it is investigating that as well. The findings are likely to have a significant impact because in recent months world-wide alarm over the appearance of melamine in pet food and animal feed has centered on China. Beijing has borne the brunt of global criticism over laxity in supervising its food producers. In late March, the FDA identified a small Chinese manufacturer in Jiangsu province as the source of melamine in wheat flour shipped to the U.S. The chemical was detected in pet food ingredients and linked to a number of deaths in cats and dogs in the U.S., leading to a massive product recall. The FDA yesterday added that "the companies have confirmed that Tembec added melamine as part of the formulation of the products to improve the binding properties of pelleted feed. Melamine is not approved as an additive" for any food, including animal feed. The companies have stopped adding melamine to their products, the FDA said. Tembec BTLSR is a subsidiary of Tembec Inc., a forest products company based in Montreal, Canada, which manufacturers newsprint and chemicals, among other products. Tembec Inc., whose shares are listed on the Toronto stock exchange, reported annual sales of 3.3 billion Canadian dollars in 2006 and a net loss of C$304 million for 2005 and 2006. The company employs around 9,000 people. In its 2006 annual report, Tembec Inc. said that one of its manufacturing facilities located in Toledo, Ohio, manufactures melamine. A man who answered the phone at the office of Tembec BTLSR declined to comment on the FDA report, referring questions to John Valley, an official of the company. A message left for Mr. Valley late Wednesday night in Ohio wasn't immediately returned. Messages left late Wednesday night for officials in the public affairs division of Tembec Inc. also weren't immediately returned. There was no answer at Uniscope's office in Colorado late Wednesday night.

The company carried out a similar level of job cuts at the beginning of the month, for a total of 3023 in this quarter and 3720 for the year, IBM spokesman Edward Barbini said. The cuts amount to roughly 1 per cent of the company's workforce, which totalled 355,000 people at the beginning of the year. But these small numbers reflect a big project inside IBM to transform its business. Services is IBM's biggest division by revenue, but the advent of lower-cost competition overseas has forced IBM to work harder to improve the unit's profit margins. In the first quarter, pre-tax income for IBM's tech services fell 19 per cent, even as revenue rose 7 per cent. Wednesday's job cuts were largely part of the company's response. Although IBM did not disclose where the layoffs were being made, the company had blamed the first-quarter profit shortfall on problems in its US outsourcing business. IBM executives said they expected no more layoffs this quarter. More cuts may follow later in the year. IBM's services overhaul not only involves cheaper labour - IBM's work force in India rose from 9000 in 2003 to 52,000 last year - but also a quest to use less labour, by rethinking or automating the way that services contracts are carried out. Last year, IBM adopted a business-retooling system known as Lean to find such opportunities. Robert Moffat, the IBM executive overseeing Lean, acknowledged it would reduce the need for some services labour, but contended that it would also create new work for the company because customers would be getting more for their money. Even as it has laid off 3700 people this year, IBM has hired 19,000 others. Mr Barbini would not provide a geographic breakdown.

While CBS hopes its $280 million purchase of London-based Last.fm is as successful as the Fox network's ownership of MySpace.com, the goals are different. "We're going to take their core kernel of DNA and see if we can apply it around sports, news and entertainment," among other types of content, said Quincy Smith, president of CBS Interactive. Last.fm is a Web site for music fans that asks users to name their favorite artists and then creates for them a customized radio stream featuring similar tunes. It's called a preference engine, and CBS wants to apply that technology across the various types of content it produces and perhaps tap into a vast library of existing content. "It's not just music that can be streamed," said Martin Stiksel, one of three Last.fm co-founders who will remain with the company. "The scope and vision was always there to expand it out." In 2005, News Corp. bought MySpace, which now has about 56 million unique monthly visitors. Users have profile pages listing their favorite bands, movies and other interests. But the site cannot generate a recommendation for a new band, for instance, like Last.fm. "We wanted to replicate the word-of-mouth model," Stiksel said earlier this year of Last.fm, which began in 2003. "You have a network of friends that plays music you like. You share their interests, and that's essentially what Last.fm does." Stiksel said Wednesday that the company has registered the domain name Last.tv, and Smith confirmed it's something CBS will likely be using in the future. Smith is attracted to Last.fm because it taps into "the wisdom of crowds," a notion that is becoming increasingly influential across the Web. He also likes the site's audience, which Last.fm officially says reaches 15 million users a month worldwide. "It's probably closer to 20 million," Smith said, with only 4.5 million of those users from the U.S. But that taps into another issue for CBS: growing an international audience. "Ninety percent of our revenue is U.S. based," Smith said. "We needed a beachhead &#091;abroad&#093;." That U.S. audience could grow rapidly, however, as Last.fm on Thursday will introduce a new application, or widget, for Facebook.com users to download to their profile pages. It will allow users of Facebook, a social site similar to MySpace, to create personalized music streams their friends can also hear. David Card, an analyst for Jupiter Research, said the deal was a smart one for CBS. "Last.fm is a good product and it has a robust community," he said. "It has one of the few recommendation engines that taps into what I listen to and have" stored on my computer. Amazon.com also has a recommendation engine, he points out, "but that's only based on items I've purchased," not on what the user already owns. Stiksel said the Last.fm technology gives people "control of their entertainment." "We have, with our concept, a way for people to revolutionize how they use media, whether its music, TV or movies." Meanwhile, News Corp.'s Fox Interactive Media unit, which runs MySpace, announced two separate deals to buy sites Photobucket.com and Flektor.com. Photobucket is an application that links personal photos and videos to Web sites, including MySpace, and Flektor lets users edit audio and video content and embed the finished product on a Web site or blog. Financial terms were not disclosed, but sources cited by The Associated Press said Fox was paying about $300 million for Photobucket, about half of the $580 million News Corp. paid for MySpace. ---------- ebenderoff@tribune.com Chicago Bears Super Bowl coverage Wonders of the world 10 for the road Send a news tip What's in it for you?

StumbleUpon Inc. is an online review site that recommends Web pages within sites such as Flickr, MySpace or YouTube, based on "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" votes from other Web users with shared interests. It counts 2.3 million users and is growing at 150 percent a year. The service helps people find Web sites, videos, products, people and other online information according to their tastes. Community members add more than 5 million recommendations per day, meaning StumbleUpon's depth improves the more often it is used. StumbleUpon combines peer recommendations with search features and as such presents an alternative to Web search leader Google Inc. . The recommendation features built into the service could serve as a referral system for eBay users to locate Web auctions that interest them, analysts say. eBay, based in San Jose, California, said it does not expect the StumbleUpon acquisition to have a material effect on its previously stated outlook for 2007 results. In April, the company had forecast full-year profit of $1.30 to $1.34 a share. (c) Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Edwards Inc. for $6.8 billion in cash and stock, creating the second-largest U.S. retail brokerage. The combined brokerage would have about 14,784 brokers, ranking behind Merrill Lynch & Co. ; and $1.15 trillion of client assets, ranking behind Merrill and Citigroup Inc. , Wachovia said.

Wachovia Corp. on Thursday said it would buy A.G. Edwards Inc. for about $6.8 billion in cash and stock to create the second-largest retail brokerage in the United States. REUTERS/Handout Email to a friend "Brokerages are demographically attractive with the anticipated graying of baby boomers and increase in retirement assets," said Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London, in an interview. "Wachovia is also acquiring the advantage of more scale. It can squeeze out a lot of costs, and boost revenue by making brokers more productive and increasing the proportion of fee-based assets." Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia expects to fold A.G. Edwards into its Wachovia Securities brokerage, pushing deeper into 48 of the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. The combined brokerage would be based in St. Louis, home of A.G. Edwards, which was founded in 1887. Wachovia has 8,166 brokers and $773 billion of client assets, while A.G. Edwards has 6,618 brokers and $374 billion of client assets.

Edwards shareholders will receive 0.9844 of a Wachovia share and $35.80 in cash for each of their shares. The terms value A.G. Edwards at $89.50 per share, a 16 percent premium over their Wednesday closing price. A.G. Edwards shares had already risen 22 percent this year. Thursday's transaction comes nearly eight months after Wachovia bought California thrift Golden West Financial Corp. for $24.2 billion, significantly expanding its mortgage operations. A.G.

"In retail brokerage, scale is key, and Wachovia will be able to distribute more products more broadly." Wachovia Securities Chief Executive Daniel Ludeman will retain his title, while A.G. Edwards Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Bagby will be chairman. Bagby, reached at his St. Louis office, declined to comment. The transaction values A.G.

Nazem, who joined the company in 1996, said in a statement on Yahoo's Web site that he intends to retire. His last day is scheduled for June 8. The move comes six months after Nazem, 45, was named head of one of the portal's three main business units. Shares of Yahoo fell to $28.24 in after-hours trading from a close of $28.38 on the Nasdaq stock exchange. undergoing a wave of change as it tries to make up ground on archrival Google. Last December, Yahoo's chief operating officer and the head of its entertainment group left as part of an executive shakeup. Google has eclipsed Yahoo in search and advertising. Yahoo's profits slid 11 percent in the first quarter from the year prior. The company's revenue for that period was $1.67 billion, less than half Google's $3.66 billion. A new advertising platform launched in February is supposed to help Yahoo profit more from search, and Nazem said he was waiting to retire until after the system was operating. Jerry Yang, Yahoo's co-founder, will replace Nazem on an interim basis.

If the vessel was Spanish or was removed from Spanish waters, any treasure would belong to Spain, the government says. "Odyssey Marine Exploration has been requested in a letter to provide information concerning the identity of the ship and the material recovered, and has not responded with the details we were asking for," Culture Ministry spokeswoman Susana Tello said. "Spain has decided to go to (the) courts to claim its right in case the discovery is Spanish," she said, adding that the lawsuit was filed May 29 at the Tampa Courts in Florida. Odyssey announced two week ago it had discovered a shipwreck it has code-named "Black Swan" and 500,000 gold and silver coins somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. Bush urges 15 major countries set global emission goal by 2008 Zoellick has new agenda for World Bank Bush calls on Congress to increase funds for fighting AIDS The Florida-based company would not say exactly where the ship was or name it, citing security concerns, and said the site was outside any country&#039;s territorial waters. In Britain, the find generated media reports that Odyssey had salvaged the wreck of the long-sought British vessel Merchant Royal, which sank in bad weather off England in 1641. Odyssey has neither confirmed nor denied these reports. Odyssey has said that the ship was not the HMS Sussex, a shipwreck that Odyssey recently got permission from the Spanish government to search for in the Strait of Gibraltar. But Spain has called the new discovery suspicious and said the booty may have come from a wrecked Spanish galleon. Tello said the Kingdom of Spain is represented by the U.S law firm Covington &#038; Burling, which have represented Spain over shipwreck cases before, involving the recovery of material from two ships, Juno and La Galga, in a 2000 court case. The Spanish government won the case at that time.

The growth rate in real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States -- was slower than the 1.3 percent pace originally estimated and the 2.5 percent pace in the final quarter of last year. The new reading disappointed economists who had been expecting a 0.8 percent growth pace for the first three months. The deceleration in real GDP growth in the first quarter primarily reflected an upturn in imports, downturns in exports and in federal government spending, and a deceleration in personal consumption expenditures for non-durable goods, the Commerce Department said. In the first quarter, U.S. exports of goods and services fell by 0.6 percent after having surged 10.6 percent in the previous quarter, while imports of goods and services rose by 5.7 percent, compared to a drop of 2.6 percent in the final quarter of last year. The trade deficit shaved a full percentage point from the GDP in the first quarter. Meanwhile, businesses cut back on inventory investment in the first quarter. That lopped nearly a percentage point off first quarter GDP. Federal government spending decreased by 3.9 percent in the first three months of this year, following an increase of 4.6 percent in the final quarter of last year. The slump in housing market also restrained overall economic activity. Investment in home building dropped by 15.4 percent in the first quarter. But that was not as deep a cut as the 19.8 percent seen in the final quarter of last year. Consumer spending, which accounts for two thirds of overall economic activity, rose by 4.4 percent in the first quarter, the most in a year. In the previous quarter, consumer spending was up 4.2 percent. An inflation gauge tied to the GDP report and closely watched by the Federal Reserve showed that core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy, rose at a rate of 2.2 percent in the first quarter. That was unchanged from its initial estimate but up from a 1.8 percent pace in the fourth quarter of 2006. GDP is considered the best measure of the country's economic fitness. The economy will expand at a pace of 2.3 percent in the second quarter of this year, the National Association for Business Economics predicts.

The drug, known chemically as temsirolimus, is the third such therapy approved since late 2005 for the disease -- the most common form of kidney cancer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. In December 2005, the FDA cleared Bayer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s Nexavar, or sorafenib. In January 2006, Pfizer Inc.'s Sutent, or sunitinib, also won approval. "The group of patients who received Torisel alone showed a significant improvement in overall survival," the FDA said. Wyeth, in a statement, said its drug would be available for patients in July. Shares of the drugmaker earlier closed down 27 cents, or less than 1 percent, at $57.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Company data on Torisel showed that patients who took it alone lived 3.5 months longer overall than those who took it with the cancer drug interferon or a combination of the two, the FDA said.

The Armonk, N.Y.-based company carried out a similar level of job cuts at the beginning of the month, for a total of 3,023 in this quarter and 3,720 for the year, IBM spokesperson Edward Barbini said yesterday. That amounts to roughly 1 per cent of the company's workforce, which included 355,000 people at the beginning of the year. But even these relatively small numbers reflect a big project inside IBM to transform its business. The services division is IBM's biggest division by revenue, but the advent of lower-cost competition overseas has forced IBM to work harder to improve the unit's profit margins. In the first quarter, pre-tax income for IBM's tech services fell 19 per cent, even as revenue rose 7 per cent. Yesterday's job cuts were largely part of the company's response. Although IBM did not disclose where the layoffs were being made, the company had blamed the first-quarter profit shortfall on problems in the company's U.S. outsourcing business. IBM executives say they expect no more layoffs this quarter. But other shifts like this â€“ IBM calls it "rebalancing" â€“ are expected to follow at times. IBM's services overhaul involves cheaper labour; the company's workforce in India rose to 52,000 last year from 9,000 in 2003. But the company is also on a quest to use less labour, rethinking and sometimes automating the ways that services contracts are carried out. Last year, IBM adopted a business-retooling system known as Lean to find such opportunities. Robert Moffat, the IBM executive overseeing Lean, acknowledges it will reduce the need for some services labour, but he contends the system will also create new work for the company overall because customers will be lured by getting more for their money. To some degree, that dynamic could explain another figure disclosed yesterday: that, even as IBM has laid off 3,700 people this year, the company has hired 19,000 others.

For the three months ended May 5, Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears Holdings said net income rose to $216 million, or $1.40 a share, up from $180 million, or $1.14 a share, earned in the year-earlier first quarter. The latest quarter's results were boosted mostly by gains from a legal settlement, a post-retirement benefit and a hurricane-related insurance claim. Adjusted to exclude items from both reporting periods, Sears Holdings' profit disappointed Wall Street, declining to $1.10 a share compared with $1.11 a share last year. Deutsche Bank analyst Bill Dreher called the results "disappointing" but said they weren't disconcerting considering that they were reflective of what close competitors such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw in the quarter and account for a very small piece of Sears Holdings' total fiscal-year picture. "There were clearly elements missing in this performance," Dreher said. "The company has had some hiccups in the past, and this is one of those weak quarters. "Sears Holdings' performance is indicative of weak results for many of the retailers during the first quarter," he said. "In the context of first quarter's contribution to Sears Holdings' annual earnings, it's only about 10%. "The changes that Sears Holdings is making to the long-term fundamentals of the business are good and continue to make progress," he said. Dreher has a buy rating on the stock with a 12-month price target of $238. In the latest quarter, Sears said the legal settlement raised earnings per share by 12 cents, while a change in post-retirement benefits at Sears Canada added 11 cents a share. The recoveries from insurance claims tied to property damage from hurricanes in 2005 accounted for another 6 cents a share and an investment in Sears Mexico netted 8 cents a share. Sears Holdings also had a gain of a penny a share on sales of assets, though the company did not explain what it sold. Partly offsetting these was a loss of 8 cents a share, linked to the derivatives tool called total return swap investments. And for the first quarter since Sears Roebuck and Kmart were merged, the company did not record a restructuring charge. Sales fell 2.5% to $11.7 billion from $12 billion. Sears has conceded that it has lost market share in sales of big appliances such as its Kenmore washers and dryers due to the weakening in housing, but showed gains in children's apparel during the latest quarter. Analysts, on average, had been expecting the company to post a profit of $1.22 a share on revenue of $11.5 billion, according to Thomson Financial. Shares of Sears Holdings sank more than 2% in early trading. Competition and 'external factors' Same-store sales, the industry's important measure of receipts rung up at stores open longer than a year, were off 3.9% in the U.S., reflecting a 3.4% drop at the company's Sears Roebuck stores and a 4.4% decline at its Kmart properties. "We believe these declines reflect both increased competition and the impact of external factors such as rising energy costs, a slower housing market and poor weather conditions during the latter part of the first quarter," the company said in its earnings release. Sears Holdings does not hold conference calls with analysts as do most of its rivals. Ahead of this year's annual meeting, Sears Holdings warned that earnings would miss original projections. It forecast then earnings of $1.30 to $1.53 a share, and net income from $200 million to $235 million. Sears Holdings, flush with cash and borrowing capacity, this month launched major marketing campaigns -- the first since the two retail chains were merged under a single owner. The company said it ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, slightly higher than the $3.2 billion of a year ago but off from $4 billion on Feb. 3. The company said the decline from February is mostly because of increases in inventory as the retailer shifted from the spring to summer selling seasons. At the annual meeting, Sears Chairman Edward Lampert said he was adding $150 million to $200 million of pharmacy products to inventories as he shifted from an outside source to in-store, a move aimed at cutting costs to consumers. Sears Holdings said it spent $113 million on capital expenditures and repaid about $47 million in debt. Also of note, the company didn't repurchase shares during the quarter, leaving it with $604 million in authorization under the existing stock-buyback plan. The company said it did receive about 114,000 shares of common stock as part of bankruptcy-related settlements. Jennifer Waters is a reporter for MarketWatch based in Chicago.

(AP Photo/Odyssey Marine Exploration, Jonathan Blair) By MAR ROMAN Associated Press Writer MADRID, Spain May 31, 2007 (AP) The Spanish government said Thursday it has filed a lawsuit in a U.S. federal court against an American firm over a shipwreck the company has found laden with a colonial-era treasure. If the vessel was Spanish or was removed from Spanish waters, any treasure would belong to Spain, Spain says. "Odyssey Marine Exploration has been requested in a letter to provide information concerning the identity of the ship and the material recovered, and has not responded with the details we were asking for," said Susana Tello, Culture Ministry spokeswoman. "Spain has decided to go to (the) courts to claim its right in case the discovery is Spanish," she added. The lawsuit was filed in Tampa, Fla. on Tuesday, Tello said. A message and e-mail left for an Odyssey spokeswoman were not immediately returned early Thursday. Odyssey announced two weeks ago that it had discovered a shipwreck containing 500,000 gold and silver coins somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. The Florida-based company said the site was outside any country's territorial waters but would not give the exact location or name of the ship. In Britain, the find generated press reports that Odyssey had salvaged the wreck of the long-sought British vessel Merchant Royal, which sank in bad weather off England in 1641. Odyssey has not confirmed or denied these reports. Odyssey has said that the ship was not in Spanish territorial waters and was not HMS Sussex, a shipwreck that Odyssey recently got permission from the Spanish government to search for in the Strait of Gibraltar. But Spain has called the new discovery suspicious and said the booty may have come from a wrecked Spanish galleon. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Despite a healthy dividend, a soaring stock price, a relatively clean environmental record and a management team that's arguably the best in the business, the company still finds itself besieged by investors and the general public alike.

( Instead of ensuring that we use less gas, politicians and consumers take the easy way out, says Fortune's Alex Taylor. ( CNN's Allan Chernoff reports on politicians blaming OPEC for the pain at the pump. (May 29) On Wednesday, activist investors vented at Exxon's annual meeting in Dallas. My big fat American gas tax Items on the agenda included greater restrictions and oversight of executive pay, goals for reducing greenhouse gases, more investment in renewable energy, and a call to put the company's nondiscrimination policy on sexual orientation into writing. None of the 15 shareholder proposals that were up for approval at the meeting won 50 percent of the shareholder vote, but four dealing with pay and governance received at least 40 percent. All four measures would increase the accountability of Exxon management, and the company's board of directors, for their policies and performance. About 47.8 percent of shares voted backed a measure that would give holders of 10 percent of Exxon's outstanding common shares the right to call special shareholder meetings, and 47.2 percent favored a proposal to allow the company to recoup incentive bonuses that weren't justified. Proposals to give shareholders an advisory vote on executive pay and to split the chief executive and chairman positions got 41.2 percent and 40 percent of the vote, respectively. But climate change was the central topic of discussion at the meeting and one environmental proposal - that the company adopt goals for greenhouse gas reductions from its products and operations - received 31 percent of the vote. Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson disputed claims by investor activists and environmentalists that the company is working to mislead the public about the causes of climate change. "What I find perplexing is why people feel threatened because we want to have a discussion," Tillerson told Reuters, when offering an explanation of why the company funds some groups that are skeptical of the mainstream scientific views of climate change. "I'm not going to just adopt a slogan. If that makes me public enemy number one, so be it," he said. About three dozen protesters - outnumbered by police - staged a peaceful demonstration outside the meeting to protest the company's funding of groups the critics believe deny or distort the science of global warming. The protesters waved banners with slogans like "People Before Profits" and chanted "No More Junk Science." "Exxon Mobil is double-crossing the public and policy-makers. It's avoiding real changes and continuing to fund groups that purposefully distort the science of global warming," said Shawnee Hoover, the campaign director of Exxpose Exxon, a coalition of green and scientific groups. Exxpose Exxon says the oil producer still funds about 40 organizations that the environmental group calls "global warming deniers," with Exxon shelling out about $2 million to the groups last year. Exxon disagrees with the claim that the groups, many of which concern themselves with a wide range of issues, are "deniers of climate change." Scientists believe the use of fossil fuels causes global warming. Consumers, faced with record gasoline prices, have also set their sights on the world's largest publicly traded oil company. Several letters calling for boycotts have reportedly been circulating on the Internet. Modeled after the May 15 'Buy no gas" day (widely viewed as ineffective since it simply shifts gas purchases from one to another), the latest round of letters urges urges customers to stop buying gasoline from a particular oil company, often ), for a month or more. The idea is that one oil company will accumulate so much gasoline it will have to slash prices to move inventory, which would in turn spark a price war with other oil companies, lowering gas prices for everyone. "Totally boycott one gas company until their price drops to $ 2.00/gal then only buy that gas until the other oil companies drop their price," wrote one reader to the CNNMoney.com energy blog. "If consumers did this they could literally set the price they pay for fuel." Unfortunately for frustrated motorists, experts say this idea won't work either. First off, just because the service station says Exxon doesn't mean it's Exxon gas. "Exxon doesn't own the service stations, they could care less," said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, which tracks energy prices. Kloza said if the mostly independently owned Exxon service stations stopped selling gasoline, Exxon the oil company would just sell its gasoline in bulk to another retailer, like Even today, Exxon will ship its gasoline to another retailer in a different part of the country if Exxon has an oversupply and the other retailer has a shortage. "They are all using the same gasoline, it's a fungible commodity," said Peter Beutel, oil analyst at Cameron Hanover. "It's like shoveling water," he said of the proposed boycott. "It wouldn't do a thing." Worse, if a service station did close due to a boycott, it might actually force prices higher as fewer competitors could lead to rising prices, he added. Both Kloza and Beutel said reducing demand was the best way to lower prices. Kloza said if every American used 4 ounces less gasoline a day, it would significantly bring down prices. Beutel said cutting out one out of every 20 trips - by carpooling or consolidating errands - would reduce gasoline demand by 4 percent a year and knock up to $1 a gallon off the retail price. "The minute gasoline demand goes negative, people start freaking out and selling gas futures," he said. - Reuters contributed to this report Gas prices: The new Salem witch trials Cheapest gas in the nation - full service 5 ways to fix Wal-Mart Northwest to emerge from bankruptcy Fixing the food fiasco Wow, I could've had a prime mortgage 10 great job markets for techies Cards that pay big-time rewards Stocks on the rise Economic growth slowest since '02 Wii will rock you Doomed GM plant is nation's most productive * : Time reflects local markets trading time. &#8224; - Intraday data delayed 15 minutes for Nasdaq, and 20 minutes for other exchanges. &copy; 2007 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York said the shelters were "to be used by wealthy individuals with taxable income generally in excess of $10 or $20 million to eliminate or reduce the taxes they would have to pay" to the Internal Revenue Service. Prosecutors a variety of criminal charges were filed against the four, including conspiracy, obstruction of the IRS, false statements and tax evasion. Ernst & Young said in a statement that those charged include two former partners and two partners who have been on administrative leave. They were part of a small group within the firm, disbanded years ago, that was responsible for developing the transactions in question, the company said. None of the individuals was part of the firm's management, it added. The accounting firm said it was cooperating with investigators and has "voluntarily made many changes and enhancements to our tax practice. We have also made other changes to our tax practice pursuant to our 2003 agreement with the IRS." Charged were Robert Coplan, 54, a former tax partner and national director for wealth planning, as well as Martin Nissenbaum, 51, national director of the firm's personal income-tax and retirement practice. Richard Shapiro, 58, and Brian Vaughn, 39, also were charged. All of the defendants were at one time members of Ernst & Young's Value Ideas Produce Extraordinary Results group, also known as Viper. The group was later named Strategic Individual Solutions Group, or SISG, according to court documents. David Weidner covers Wall Street for MarketWatch.

This drug has been found to prolong the survival of advanced renal carcinoma patients by about 3 Â½ months, according to a study led by Gary R. Hudes, M.D., director of the Genitourinary Malignancies Program at Fox Chase Cancer Center. The study has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine. A total of 626 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were enrolled in the study and were subjected to one of the following three treatments â€“ the new drug Torisel, an older drug called interferon, or both the drugs together. The patients who received Torisel alone survived longer than those who received interferon, the usual or â€˜standardâ€™ treatment for this disease. According to this study, the greatest increase in median survival was observed in patients receiving Torisel (49 percent) compared with patients treated with interferon only. Patients treated with Torisel and interferon combined had a 15 percent increase in median survival compared with interferon alone. The median survival for Torisel alone was 10.9 months compared with and 8.4 months for the Torisel and interferon, and 7.3 months for the interferon. "This is the first study to show that a new drug can improve overall survival for patients with metastatic renal cell cancer," said Hudes. Renal Cell Carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer, accounting for about 90% of all adult kidney cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S. Many patients with kidney cancer opt for a surgery to remove the tumor. However, about 35% of them experience either a recurrence of the tumor or its spread to other organs. â€œFor these patients, the goal of treatment is to prevent further spread and growth of the cancer, and ideally, to reduce that amount of cancer," Hudes said. "Until recently, physicians lacked effective drugs to control the disease." The drug Torisel is basically an enzyme inhibitor, a protein that regulates cell production, growth and survival. Temsirolimus blocks the function of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key protein within cells regulating cell proliferation, growth and survival. It has also been found to block angiogenesis, the process to create a blood supply to tumors in order to maintain their growth. This is the third drug for kidney cancer to be approved by FDA since late 2005, the earlier two being Bayerâ€™s Nexavar, or sorafenib and Pfizer Inc.'s Sutent, or sunitinib. Common side effects of Torisel include rash, fatigue, mouth sores, nausea, edema and a loss of appetite. Common laboratory abnormalities associated with the drug are high blood sugar, elevated blood lipids and tryglycerides, low RBC, WBC and platelet counts. Also, this study focused on patients with the most advanced tumors. According to Hudes, Torisel can be expected to provide greater benefits to patients with less extensive metastatic disease. Wyeth, in a statement, said its drug would be available for patients in July. The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

http://www.twincities.com/business/ci_6024065&cid TwinCities.com - Ceridian to be sold for $5.3 billion Working Q & A Ceridian to be sold for $5.3 billion Under pressure from key investor, company agrees to private buyout Article Last Updated: 05/30/2007 09:43:37 PM CDT After months of pressure from an unhappy shareholder, Ceridian Corp. said Wednesday that it will be sold for $5.3 billion to Thomas H. Lee Partners, a private-equity group, and Fidelity National Financial Inc. Ceridian, which provides human-resources and computer-processing services for business clients, will keep its headquarters in Bloomington, and Kathryn Marinello will remain as CEO, a company spokesman said Wednesday. The company employs about 1,000 people in Minnesota. After a review of "strategic alternatives" aimed at providing maximum value to the company's shareholders, Ceridian's board decided that a sale "represents the best and most certain way to achieve that goal," L. White Matthews, chairman of Ceridian's board, said in a release Wednesday. The deal will pay Ceridian shareholders $36 cash per share, a 5 percent premium over Wednesday's closing price of $34.19. In a release about the deal, Ceridian noted that the price represents a 17 percent premium over the closing stock price on Feb. 12, the day before Ceridian announced it was exploring strategic alternatives. News of the deal came after the market's close, but most of the increase already had been built into the stock. Ceridian shares went up another $1.41 to $35.60 in after-hours trading. Ceridian traces its corporate lineage back to Control Data Corp. and now is among the largest human-resources outsourcing companies. Despite steady growth, the company ran into difficulties with its largest investor earlier this year. William Ackman, who heads Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund that owns 14 percent of Ceridian's outstanding shares, demanded in January that Ceridian spin off its profitable Comdata division. He publicized his demands after a face-to-face meeting with Marinello left him unsatisfied with the company's direction. Marinello had taken over as CEO last fall. Ackman also is proposing his own slate of candidates for the company's board of directors. Shareholders will vote on board members at Ceridian's annual meeting, which has yet to be scheduled. The deal announced Wednesday will get a vote from shareholders at the annual meeting as well, Ceridian said. The meeting will be scheduled "as soon as practicable following the filing and review of proxy materials," the company's release said, and will take place no later than Sept. 21. While Ceridian remained profitable, its larger human-resources division was seen as a laggard compared with the smaller Comdata division, which processes and issues credit, debit and gift cards, primarily for trucking and retail customers in the United States. In 2005, for instance, Comdata generated 28 percent of Ceridian's revenue, but 74 percent of Ceridian's operating earnings. Earlier this month, Ceridian fired Gary Krow, the president of the Comdata division, after he allegedly provided Pershing Square with confidential information. In a release earlier this month, Ackman said that Krow had told him in January that he was planning to leave Comdata because his authority had been diminished and because he disagreed with the strategic direction of Ceridian. Attempts to reach Ackman by phone Wednesday for comment on the Ceridian deal were unsuccessful. Thomas H. Lee Partners and Fidelity National will each own roughly half of Ceridian when the deal is done, and each expects to bring in co-investors. "We are extremely impressed with Kathy Marinello and the management team of Ceridian," said Scott Jaeckel, managing director of Thomas H. Lee Partners. "We fully support their vision and commitment to all of Ceridian's customers and employees." The deal will bring some uncertainty to Ceridian employees, though. In a QA e-mail sent to employees Wednesday, one question asked about any work-force reductions resulting from the deal. Ceridian answered that it will "continue to evaluate the resources required to implement the company's strategic plan and will make adjustments as necessary." Thomas H. Lee Partners has about $12 billion in equity capital invested in more than 100 businesses. Its deals have given it a stake in West Corp., Dunkin Brands, Fisher Scientific, Experian and Snapple Beverage. Fidelity National is a leading provider of title and specialty insurance.

According to the ACLU complaint, Binyam MohÂ­amed, an Ethiopian, Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian, and Abou Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen, were all subject to the CIA renditions programme, in which prisoners are captured in one country and sent to CIA overseas secret detention sites, or to other countries' intelligence services, for interrogation. "We are filing this lawsuit on behalf of three individuals who have been repeatedly tortured, terrified, humiliated and deprived of their basic human rights," said Anthony Romero, the executive director of the ACLU. "American companies should not be profiting from a CIA rendition programme that is unlawful and contrary to core American values." President George W. Bush conceded the existence of the secret detention sites last year. The ACLU says Mr Agiza is imprisoned in Egypt, while Mr Britel is being held in Morocco. An Italian judge has dismissed all charges of suspected terrorism against Mr Britel. Dozens of members of the Italian parliament have petitioned Morocco over his release. As part of its case, the ACLU cites comments by a senior Jeppesen Dataplan executive in a New Yorker magazine article, in which he says the company "do all of the extraordinary rendition flights â€“ you know, the torture flights". The CIA and Boeing both declined to comment on the lawsuit. In a related case, the ACLU also petitioned the Supreme Court on Wednesday over the case of Khaled al-Masri, a Lebanese-born German who was captured in Macedonia in December 2003 and allegedly held until May 2004 by the CIA in a secret prison in Afghanistan. A federal court dismissed a previous lawsuit that accused George Tenet, the former CIA director, of violating human rights laws by authorising CIA operatives to capture Mr Masri. The court agreed to dismiss the case on the grounds that it could compromise state secrets. A former intelligence official told the FT that Mr Tenet's office had agreed to apprehend Mr Masri despite warnings from senior intelligence operatives that he had no connection with the "war on terror" and that his name "al-Masri", which translates as "the Egyptian," was a common name in the Middle East. The ACLU alleges that Jeppesen provided logistics services, such as flight planning, catering and hotel accommodation for crew, for more than 70 rendition flights involving two aircraft over a four-year period. The lawsuit also accuses Jeppesen of providing services for the flight used to transport Mr Masri. Copyright The Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ernst & Young partners charged with tax fraud Big four accountancy firm latest to be caught by massive US criminal investigation into tax shelters for the wealthy Michael Herman and Robert Lindsay Four current and former partners of accounting firm Ernst & Young were today charged with tax fraud conspiracy and other crimes relating to tax shelters for wealthy clients. The charges are the latest in a long-running criminal investigation by the Inland Revenue Service and the US Department of Justice which has already seen rival big four firm KPMG having to settle for $456 million and one of its former partners charged with fraud. Two of the men charged today are still senior partners at Ernst & Young but have been placed on "administrative leave". They are Martin Nissenbaum, national director of Ernst & Young's personal income tax and retirement planning practice and tax partner Richard Shapiro. The other two are former E&Y partners Robert Coplan, a lawyer from Texas who previously served in the IRS&rsquo; Legislation and Regulations Division and Brian Vaughn, an accountant from Louisiana. KPMG faces US criminal investigation KPMG counts cost of being too aggressive Ex-chief at KPMG charged with fraud All four worked in a group set up by the company in 1998 to develop tax shelters, according to an indictment filed in US District Court in Manhattan. They allegedly defrauded the Internal Revenue Service from 1998 through 2004 by designing, marketing and selling fraudulent tax vehicles. US Attorney Michael Garcia said in a statement that the criminal indictment targets &ldquo;tax professionals whose deceit costs this country untold millions in tax revenues.&rdquo; The charges follow other a long running probe by the Inland Revenue Service and a criminal probe by the Department of Justice into potentially illegal tax shelters which has already led to KPMG's former deputy chairman, Jeffrey Stein, being charged among nine others for allegedly designing illegal tax shelters to help clients of KPMG to avoid paying more than $1 billion (&pound;560 million) of tax. According to today's indictment, the defendants created documents containing false and fraudulent descriptions of the clients&rsquo; motivations for entering into the transactions to hide the tax fraud from the IRS. The partners enticed clients to participate in the shelters by getting law firms to provide letters claiming that the tax shelter losses or deductions would &ldquo;more likely than not&rdquo; survive IRS challenge, the court papers said. They were charged with conspiracy to defraud the IRS, tax evasion, making false statements and impeding and impairing the lawful functioning of the IRS. The IRS has spent a year trying to force more than 90 accountancy firms, law firms, insurance companies, banks and brokerages to disclose the names of customers and their tax arrangements. It has filed lawsuits against several accountancy firms, including KPMG, for refusing to hand over the details. PricewaterhouseCoopers paid an undisclosed sum to settle tax shelter abuses dating back to the mid-1990s. Ernst & Young recently agreed to a $15 million fine and said that it would provide the IRS with full information about clients. KPMG's Jeffrey Stein, retired at the end of last November.

Spain wants details of shipwreck treasure Thursday 31st May, 2007 Spain has launched legal action over a shipwreck containing $500 million in coins. There have been rumors that the wreck was found off Spain, although the salvagers, Odyssey Marine Exploration who describe the wreck only as a 17th Century vessel, purportedly found it off the coast of England. They will not say exactly where it was found and wonâ€™t respond to any information requested by Spain. A lawyer for the Spanish government says if the vessel was Spanish, any treasure would belong to Spain and the firm could be guilty of plundering. The Kingdom of Spain has already won cases involving the recovery of material from two ships, Juno and La Galga. Odyssey has so far sent 17 tons of coins recovered from the wreck back to the U.S. for authentication.

Stellar Emery not enough for Sens Rodriguez helps talk Yankees into a win Planting trees good for the conscience Mackenzie pipeline 'not economical,' Exxon says Claudia Cattaneo And Jon Harding, Financial Post, with files from news services Published:Â Thursday, May 31, 2007 CALGARY - Exxon Mobil Corp. has sent out the strongest message yet that it is backing out of plans to build a natural gas pipeline down the Mackenzie Valley. Rex Tillerson, Exxon chief executive, said yesterday rising costs have made the project difficult to carry out. "It may just be that this project will have to wait for a different cost environment," Mr. Tillerson said after the company's annual meeting in Dallas. "It's not economical at this point." Rex Tillerson, CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp., told reporters at a news conference following Exxon's shareholders' meeting in Dallas yesterday that the Mackenzie pipeline project is not viable. Email to a friend He said he didn't know whether the federal government could create "enough room in the fiscal structure" to accommodate the rising costs. That's a sharply different message from barely 18 months ago in Calgary, when Mr. Tillerson was keen to develop Arctic resources to meet global energy needs. He said at the time: "It's a long process and there is lots of interests that have to be addressed, but we continue to make good progress and my expectation is that we will ultimately get across the finish line with this thing." Since then, the project's costs have more than doubled, but the oil companies proposing it, headed by Exxon Mobil affiliate Imperial Oil Ltd., also made headway in solving issues with aboriginal groups. Meanwhile it nearly completed a marathon of regulatory hearings across the North. The oil companies' drive to move forward appears to have hit a wall in negotiations for fiscal terms with Ottawa. The companies were looking for billions in breaks, but the federal government has said no. The National Post reported two weeks ago that Ottawa is exploring taking control of the $16.2-billion project and buying out the oil company consortium as a way to salvage the major northern infrastructure development. Talks along those lines are continuing, sources say. Another plan being considered involves TransCanada Corp., Canada's largest pipeline company, owning the pipeline with the Aboriginal Pipeline Group (APG), an aboriginal group with a one-third interest in the project, with financial support from the federal government. Fred Carmichael, chairman of the APG, said as far as the APG is concerned, it will do everything it can to keep the project alive. Mr. Carmichael would not discuss the status of talks between the partners and Ottawa. Jim Prentice, the federal Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, has vehemently denied the project is dead or that the federal government is considering getting involved financially. Imperial also said it is still committed to the project. Cathy Cram, spokeswoman for ConocoPhillips, another partner, said Mr. Tillerson has not changed his views. "We don't believe he is saying anything different than he has been saying in the last number of months," she said. A spokesman for Exxon Mobil, Mark Boudreaux, said the project is not viable under the current fiscal regime. "We are continuing to work with the partners and the federal government to see if we can identify a commercial project to move forward," he said. Mr. Tillerson was equally pessimistic about the Alaska natural- gas pipeline, another giant project to ship gas from Alaska to the United States. He said that although Exxon has not done any recent cost studies for a proposed pipeline in Alaska, he believes those costs would have risen dramatically as well. Costs were between US$22- billion and US$25-billion about three years ago, when the company did its last estimate, Mr. Tillerson said. "It involves lots of steel, lots of compressors, lots of valves, all the same things you need for the Canadian project," he said. Â© National Post 2007 John Mayer acts out a bizarre ...

Colby has been forced out as chief financial officer after violating the insurance company's code of conduct. WellPoint declined to say what the violation was. The news comes a day before Executive Vice President Angela Braly takes over as CEO from Larry Glasscock, who will remain as chairman. Company executives said during a conference call with analysts that Colby's resignation had nothing to do with the transition. Braly didn't elaborate on the reasons for Colby's departure other than to say the violation he committed was of a "non-business nature." Glasscock did say the investigation found no illegal conduct, and Colby's actions "in no way related to the company's performance or financial condition, both of which remain strong." During the conference call, an analyst asked whether Colby was offered a second chance, since no law was broken. Glasscock said the chief financial officer was treated like any employee. Glasscock declined to comment on whether the violation was a repeat offense. Wayne S. DeVeydt, chief accounting officer since March 2005, was named chief financial officer.

Late Wednesday, the Minneapolis-based payroll and tax filing services provider said it agreed to sell itself to Thomas H. Lee Partners LP and Fidelity National Financial Inc. for $36 per share cash. The proposal represents a premium of a little more than 5 percent over the stock's closing price of $34.19 Wednesday. Ceridian's stock rose $1.26, or 3.7 percent, to $35.45 in premarket trading Thursday. "Some investors were expecting a larger premium," JPMorgan Securities analyst Tien-tsin Huang wrote in a client note. But analysts said most of the takeover premium has already been built into the shares because investors anticipated a deal. The stock closed Wednesday up 22.2 percent for the year. In December, an investment fund called Pershing Square Capital Management LP became Ceridian's biggest shareholder, with a stake that now totals 14.5 percent of the company's outstanding shares, and began agitating for change. In February, the company hired Greenhill & Co. LLC as a financial adviser to help "explore a broad range of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value." The Thomas H. Lee/Fidelity National offer represents a 17.2 percent premium to the stock's price before that announcement. "The sale of the company was already broadly speculated in the market and largely captured in the stock," said Goldman Sachs analyst Elizabeth W. Grausam. Grausam said rampant takeover speculation has pushed up stock prices across the sector, "leaving little room for robust takeout premiums." Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Wealth managers and private banks are expanding to meet the demand from the growing numbers of affluent but â€œtime-poorâ€ investors who want professionals to manage their money for them and treat them as a name and not an account number. The bracket between Â£100,000 and Â£250,000 is below the traditional private banking threshold of Â£500,000 but private banks and wealth managers see this sector as the fastest-growing segment of the market. Many of the private banks, several of them acquired recently by high street banks, are targeting the newly affluent. They want to reach a new generation of high- earning clients who are growing in number by 7-10 per cent a year, according to research by business strategy consultants MDRC. The growth of wealth management and private banking is in contrast to dwindling branch networks and declining service offered by the high street banks. The private banks and wealth managers are opening new offices. Lloyds TSB has started opening private banking lounges in high street branches around the UK to offer an exclusive service to its clients. Recent openings include Richmond Upon Thames and the Law Courts in London. Many of the private banks and wealth managers promise old-fashioned personal service â€“ if they like the size of your portfolio. Lloyds TSB Private Banking has 45,000 clients and targets those with assets of Â£250,000 or more but will consider those below, especially those with potential to add to their wealth. It will also take on clients with Â£100,000 who want to use its asset management service. Independent financial advisers are targeting the affluent too and enjoy the biggest wealth management market share at 33 per cent. US-based wealth manager and stockbroker Edward Jones is expanding rapidly and already has more than 100 offices in the UK, the fastest-growing â€œmass affluentâ€ market in Europe. As the banks and wealth managers have stepped up their services, research suggests that the demographics of the sector are changing rapidly. The number of traditionally wealthy, passing family wealth between generations, is static and has been overtaken by growth in the high- earner category. Many of these are City workers enjoying high salaries and bonuses and those running their own businesses. MDRC chief executive Richard Williams says that growth in the high-earner category has reduced the average age of newly affluent investors from 55 to 47 over the past decade. Despite the growth in private banking and wealth management, one in five affluent investors remains suspicious of external wealth managers and prefers a DIY approach. Some are concerned about the quality of advice and high fees. More people are being persuaded, however, that the time saving alone can make it worth considering a professional wealth manager. Among the new clients of wealth managers are Alan Hunter, 61, and John Haddrell, 45, directors of thriving property rental business Midway in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. As their business grew rapidly along with their personal assets they decided to turn to advisory firm Edward Jones. Their Edward Jones investment representative Vik Sharma regularly visits them at their office and homes. Haddrell, who has a portfolio of more than Â£300,000, says he had previously spent up to seven hours a week managing his own investments. He decided to seek a wealth manager after realising he was spending too much time watching the stock markets and not enough running his business. â€œI was reticent at first to use an adviser because I was concerned about the quality of advice. But I realised that running a business makes life very busy and itâ€™s nice to know somebody is keeping an eye on your investments for you all the time,â€ he says. John Hutchinson, 62, a retired chief executive of a music copyright business, and his wife Elspeth, 60, from Essex, became clients of Lloyds TSB Private Banking last year. Lloyds manages their joint Â£400,000 portfolio and provides tax and trust advice including advice on their two French properties. Barclays Private Banking targets those with more than Â£500,000 but its Premier Banking Service caters for those earning over Â£100,000 or with Â£50,000-plus to invest. HSBC Private Banking offers worldwide offices and Royal Bank of Scotland has expanded its private banking service by acquiring Coutts and Adam & Company. Other private banks include C Hoare & Co, Butterfield Private Bank, Brown Shipley & Co and NM Rothschild & Sons. As the sector has become more competitive, many private banks have added services including independent financial advice, trust and taxation planning and family wealth transfer advice. All offer a personal â€œrelationshipâ€ manager who promises that you will always be a name, not a number. Private banks are not the only providers of wealth management services. There is a growing queue of specialist wealth managers and independent financial advisers targeting the Â£100,000- plus bracket. The Association of Private Client Investment Managers (Apcims) lists more than 200 member firms and the number is growing. Firms offering wealth management services include financial adviser John Scott & Partners, Close Bros, Tilney Investment Management, Killik & Co, and Brewin Dolphin. Andrew Fisher is the chief executive of financial planning business John Scott & Partners, an Apcims member. It has 12 offices, 165 planners and 200,000 clients in the UK. He is a former chief executive of Coutts. He believes that DIY clients in the newly affluent category in particular should give serious consideration to using a wealth manager not just to provide time-saving, professional management but also to provide an valuable external eye on their portfolios. He warns that like medicine, â€œself diagnosisâ€ can be damaging to your financial health. The costs of wealth management will depend on the type of wealth manager but it is worth remembering that the larger the portfolio the lower the annual management percentage fee should be and that fees can be negotiable. Annual charges for portfolio management typically range from 1-2 per cent and private banks will usually charge Â£10-Â£30 per month in bank account fees but will often waive this if large sums are invested.

Miller May 30 (Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines Corp., the world&#39;s largest computer-services company, cut about 1,570 jobs mainly in its technology services unit, where profit fell 19 percent in the latest quarter. Most of the reductions were in North America and workers were notified today, according to Edward Barbini, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM. The division accounted for more than a third of IBM&#39;s $22 billion in sales in the first quarter. Today&#39;s cuts are equal to about 1.2 percent of the U.S. workforce. This month IBM also trimmed about 1,300 jobs at its global services unit, which incorporates the technology division, to help reduce expenses in the U.S., where IBM has about 128,000 employees. In the technology unit, first-quarter gross margin, the percentage of sales left after production costs, was unchanged from a year earlier, IBM said last month. IBM shares rose $1.02 to $106.93 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have gained 10 percent this year. Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is targeting software, whose sales are growing faster than revenue from services, to help fuel profit growth. IBM aims to get about half its earnings from software by 2010, he said earlier this month. The company also has sought to spur increases by buying back stock, and yesterday said it repurchased about $12.5 billion in shares since announcing the program last month, equal to more than 80 percent the amount planned. IBM bought back 118.8 million shares, or 8 percent of outstanding common stock, at an initial price of $105.18 per share. The move may help boost 2007 earnings per share by 13 percent to 14 percent, IBM said. IBM has cut about 3,000 jobs this quarter, and had 355,800 employees as of last year. Lee Conrad, national coordinator for the Alliance at IBM, estimated that job cuts may reach 12,000 this year, saying the company has moved work overseas. His group, which he says has 400 dues-paying and 5,500 non-paying members, is seeking union recognition at IBM. Barbini declined to comment on further possible reductions. IBM has hired 14,000 workers globally this year, he said. He declined to say how many people are employed in the technology services division. To contact the reporter on this story: Matthew R.

The branch manager of the Bank of America called police about 10 a.m. after receiving a fax containing images of a lit match and a bomb with a fuse, bank spokesman Ernesto Anguilla said. But text explaining the fax was an internal bank promotion failed to transmit. The missing text included the phrases "The countdown begins" and "Small business commitment week June 4-8," according to a copy circulated by police. "The fax machine malfunctioned, so a partial image came through that looked somewhat suspicious," Anguilla said. Fears also arose because the branch received a suspicious package delivered by a customer around the same time, police said. A State Police bomb squad searched the bank branch and checked out the package, which was a delivery of documents. About 15 small businesses in a shopping plaza were evacuated for about three hours, including a day care center with about 30 children, Police Chief Scott Rohmer said. The fax was sent to the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank's branches in parts of New England, New York and New Jersey. It did not result in any other bomb scares at other branches, Anguilla said.

Edwards for .8 Billion - Mergers, Acquisitions, Venture Capital, Hedge Funds -- DealBook - New York Times tag, as close to the beginning of it as possible--> Wachovia to Buy A.G. Edwards for $6.8 Billion May 31, 2007, 7:08 am said Thursday it would buy for $6.8 billion in cash and stock, forming the second-largest retail stock brokerage in the United States after . The deal for St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards marks the latest big grab for Wachovia Securities, Wachovia&#8217;s brokerage unit, which nearly doubled in size in 2003 when it took control of With the addition of A.G. Edwards, Wachovia Securities will have more than 3,300 brokerage locations nationwide, more than $1.1 trillion in client assets and nearly 15,000 financial advisers. The combined retail brokerage business will operate out of St. Louis, Wachovia said, while A.G. Edwards&#8217;s other lines of business, including stock research and investment banking, will be folded into Charlotte, N.C.-based Wachovia&#8217;s current operations. Wachovia Securities was formed in 2003 through a joint venture with Prudential that did not involve any payment by Wachovia. That transaction put the brokerage firm in third place in the United States, behind Merrill and . (Prudential still owns a 38 percent stake in Wachovia Securities.) Thursday&#8217;s deal, which will place Wachovia ahead of Citi in terms of size, involves a significant outlay of cash and stock: It calls for A.G. Edwards&#8217;s shareholders to get 0.9844 Wachovia shares and $35.80 in cash per A.G. Edwards share, valuing their stock at $89.50, a 16 percent premium over Wednesday&#8217;s closing price. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2007, Wachovia said. Wachovia, formed through a series of mergers over the years, has been expanding on the banking side as well. Last year, it bought Golden West Financial, one of the last major independent banks on the West Coast, in a $26 billion deal. Daniel J. Ludeman, currently president and chief executive of Wachovia Securities, will keep those roles at the combined brokerage firm. A.G. Edwards&#8217;s chairman and chief executive, Robert Bagby, will be chairman of the enlarged brokerage firm.

Great for Chris Gammon Wachovia&#8217;s new partner â€” Posted by Vivian I Gammon Assuming Wachovia got the buyout numbers right, as a shareholder think this is a very smart acquisition. An A.G. Edwards&#8217; office caught my attention when I attended a GOP county meeting the other day in a prosperous very small town Iowa county seat. Aside from a couple of local banks, it&#8217;s the only real financial game in town. â€” Posted by MARK KLEIN, M.D. As an employee of A.G. it leaves me with many questions but as a shareholder I&#8217;m pleased! I kind of take pride in the A.G. Edwards name. I hope that this doesn&#8217;t bring down the reputation the company has built up. â€” Posted by Tina Wachovia has a brilliant long term strategy. Little by little, step by step, year by year, they are setting the stage to becoming a true national bank, instead of just regional (East coast plus Texas and Calif.) They wait for the right time and the right price and they pounce. It may take another 10 years, but this is one well run and smart company. Kudos&#8230; â€” Posted by Ted Koppel Not in agreement here. Looking closely there are only the optics of a strategy that would truly work in the 1980&#8217;s but not going forward. It embraces size but not necessarily change much less agility. Wacovia management tends to say yes to many projects and investments without close, intelligent internal scrutiny. Too much Carolina Pride and not enough questioning and real creativity or foresight. This is a Citbank/Legg deal at very best&#8230;. and I am not impressed by the Edwards offices or brokers. Too much freedom and not enough solid client contact or production. The only people doing well are Edwards stockholders taking an exit.. â€” Posted by Hank I am very happy to see this since I am a client of Wachovia Securities. Perhaps it will enhance my portfolio. â€” Posted by Joel K. Joness As a twenty-year AGEdwards retail brokerage customer, I am concerned about Wachovia&#8217;s influence on the firm. I do not have a favorable impression of Wachovia&#8217;s customer service from my experience as a retail customer of theirs; nor do I find their track record on ethics and corporate responsibility to be acceptable iin order to win my business back. While cost savings from the merger might be desireable, I perceive no other benefits to size for the retail customer. I expect to vote against the merger with my feet. While i-bankers, shareholders and corporate officers might be pleased by the lucrative transaction, they should wonder about the impact on long-term shareholder value of departures of customers like me. â€” Posted by Andrew McLean To investors of AGE, this should be a positive move or neutral at best. With AGE as well as Wachovia, customers are served by individual Financial Consultants and your relationship with them does not need to change. Wachovia does have a much broader platform and access to more types of financial securities - private equity, hedge, alternative investments. I am a customer of Wachovia as a byproduct of prior mergers. Same Financial Advisor - initially with Everen, then Prudential and now Wachovia. And I&#8217;m very happy with the platform. â€” Posted by Jim McGhee I have to question the strategy here. Wachovia seems out of focus with their insurance operations - it&#8217;s simply dying on the vine. It may be they are purchasing the talent to run their operations properly and get the most out of what they have already in place. If it ends up that AGE management takes over key positions in Wachovia then it was smart. If it goes the other way and AGE talent goes elsewhere then the move was pure folly. â€” Posted by Warren Buffet As former A.G.Edwards 7 Sons financial advisor in Maryland I think that this is yet another loss for middle class investors as Bank of America/Mations Bank now Wachovia aqusition frenzy inevitably and clearly prefers practices and operational style which in general and to a significant degree damages the best interest of retail clientele, here AGE customers. Subsequently to my work with AGE I was with Fleet Bank here at North East and I had the opportunity to witness BoA unscurpulosu impsition of their corporate &#8220;culture&#8221; on this rather sucessful regional financial institution. Treatment of Fleet&#8217;s clients naturally did not improve, victim of &#8220;:aquisition at any cost to customers as long as it enriches management&#8221; philosophy. â€” Posted by Sid Edward Jones here I come!!!!!!!! â€” Posted by Customer Wachovia really needs to work on their customer service and customer relations as it grows to that &#8221; too big to be customer friendly&#8221; status. A.G. Edwards has always meant quality. Wachovia can learn a lot from them. â€” Posted by JOHN W.

BEA also released its first estimate of first-quarter corporate profits. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) The deceleration in first-quarter GDP growth primarily reflected a downturn in net exports. First-quarter corporate profits increased 6.3 percent from the same quarter a year ago. In the fourth quarter, profits grew 18.3 percent. Profits of financial corporations increased 13.1 percent in the first quarter, and profits of nonfinancial corporations decreased 0.4 percent.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted U.S. Company Used Melamine in Feed Humans Unlikely to Be Harmed Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, May 31, 2007; Page A03 company has long been adding the industrial toxin melamine to animal feed ingredients, and those feeds have been eaten by livestock and fish meant for human consumption, officials with the Food and Drug Administration The company used the chemical as a binding agent to hold feed granules in pellet form, in contrast to the recent pet food scandal, which involved imported ingredients that were spiked with melamine to provide a false measure of protein content, officials said. View Post coverage of the pet food contamination responsible for several pet deaths. Pet Food Claims Animal Lives A widespread contamination of pet food has been linked to the deaths of several dogs and cats and thousands of reports of sick animals throughout the country. In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article But as with the pet food scandal, they said, the levels of melamine involved appear to be too low to harm humans who may have eaten animals that consumed the tainted feed. The company, Tembec BTLSR of , sold the melamine-laden ingredients to Uniscope of , which used them to make three finished food products -- one for cattle, sheep and goats, and two for fish and shrimp. The contamination came to the FDA's attention on May 18 after Uniscope officials tested for melamine in the feed components they were buying -- something the FDA has been encouraging food producers to do. The FDA began an investigation the next working day, officials said, and after about 10 days decided how to proceed. Officials said that Tembec initiated a formal recall of its products yesterday and that the company has stopped adding the chemical. It remains unclear why Tembec did not stop using melamine months ago, given the intense publicity generated by the recent pet food scandal, during which officials repeatedly made it clear that melamine is not an approved additive for human or animal food. "What they knew and didn't know before will be part of the investigation as it unfolds," , the FDA's assistant commissioner for food protection, said during a telephone news conference yesterday. For now, he said, "it's speculation in terms of motives and who knew what." Officials said they do not know how many animals may have eaten the food or how long melamine has been used to make pellets. But the presumption, Acheson said, is that it has been a long-standing practice. Melamine levels in the companies' livestock feed were so low that they did not pose a risk to the animals, or to consumers, Acheson said. Levels in the fish and shrimp feed were high enough to raise some concerns about those animals, but are still "very unlikely to pose a human health risk," he added. Acheson said that the two fish feed products, which Tembec made for Uniscope using tainted ingredients, were exported. The FDA is trying to track the amounts shipped and to find out what countries those feeds went to. He said it is not known whether -- which has suffered significant political damage in recent months for having been caught exporting melamine-tainted pet food ingredients to the -- was among the countries that may have received the melamine-tainted U.S. products.

IBM in 2006 alone added some 19,000 employees around the world. The layoffs underscore the company's ongoing shift of resources toward outsourcing locations, and its effort to embrace business lines with robust profits. – The Reliable Workhorses for Business – are built on the legendary LaserJet printer technology, delivering exceptional print quality, performance and reliability. Trade in your old desktop printer today to receive up to $500 back by mail has cut more than 1,500 additional jobs from its information technology services unit, the company said Wednesday. The move is the latest in a series of changes to revamp the company to better compete in a changing technology landscape. Big Blue laid off 1,573 more people from its services business in North America this week, bringing the total of jobs cut in that business line to more than 3,000 since the start of the second quarter, IBM said. The cuts represent just a fraction of the company's total workforce of more than 355,000, but underscore the ongoing shifting of resources away from high-cost centers such as the U.S. and Canada toward India and other outsourcing locations, and also a shift within IBM to embrace software and other business lines where profits are more robust. In fact, the layoffs do not mean IBM is shrinking, with the company saying recently that it added some 19,000 employees around the globe during 2006 alone. While speculation is that many of those jobs have been added overseas, IBM does not provide regular updates on the geographic distribution of its workforce. Shares of Big Blue were slightly higher in late morning trading Wednesday to US$106.27. IBM's services unit is its largest generator of revenue, but profit margins have shrunk considerably in recent years, in part because of competition from companies based in India and other lower-cost centers. No additional job cuts are planned in the short term, IBM said, though the company is known to be constantly re-evaluating its employee distribution as part of a larger improvement project aimed at creating a more lean enterprise. IBM is seeking ways to reduce its reliance on labor in the services business by automating processes that can be done without human intervention and shifting work to lower-cost locations when it can be done without hurting customer service Moreover, IBM is changing its business model to rely more on the profits from software, the company told investors last week. This move will make it more profitable in coming years, IBM said. IBM recognizes the opportunities to improve the profitability of its services business by emulating its overseas-based competitors, UBS analyst Ben Reitzes told the . Although IBM is becoming more of a software company and will continue to evolve into a software provider thanks to more than 20 acquisitions it's still integrating, services are still a key part of its overall strategy "Services are a way to sell more software and hardware -- they all go hand in hand," he noted. Still, IBM is wisely wary of taking a loss in any part of its business in order to drive growth in other areas. Even though the U.S. economy appears to be humming along -- and the broad stock market testing new record high levels -- IBM is not alone in cutting workers. In recent months, have each announced thousands of layoffs. In fact, job cuts appear to be accelerating, with the number of layoffs in April up 44 percent compared to the month before, a possible sign that companies are preparing for leaner times ahead. While the home-building sector has been the focus of many job cuts, almost all sectors are seeing reductions, though many appear to be more strategic in nature than purely driven by a need to cut costs, said John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas "Companies that can get ahead of a trend will be better positioned if the economy does take a dip," he told the At IBM, job cuts have been a regular occurrence for some time. During 2005, it cut some 15,000 jobs in the face of lower-than-expected profits, but also said it would add more workers in key areas. It has also added thousands of workers through its software-firm buying spree.

The fax from a marketing group about a Bank of America small business promotion contained images of a lighted match and a bomb with a fuse, bank spokesman Ernesto Anguilla said. But words explaining the promotion did not transmit. "The fax machine malfunctioned, so a partial image came through that looked somewhat suspicious," Anguilla said. The missing text included the phrases "The countdown begins" and "Small business commitment week June 4-8," according to a copy circulated by police. "It was an internal communication designed only for our employees," Anguilla said. The fax was sent to the bank&#039;s branches in parts of New England as well as New York and New Jersey.

Two companies in Ohio and Colorado recalled the ingredients found to contain melamine, a chemical used in the manufacture of plastics that was linked to the massive pet food recall in March. The contaminated pet food is believed to have killed dogs and cats across the USA. The tainted products have embroiled China in a global controversy over the safety of its food exports. The Food and Drug Administration's Wednesday announcement of the feed recall marks the first discovery of melamine in U.S.-made ingredients. Melamine is not approved for use in feed, pet or human food. The recalls cover the ingredients and fish feed made using the ingredients. Any livestock feed made using the ingredient wasn't recalled because the melamine levels were so low, the FDA said. The FDA said there is also little risk to human health because of the low concentrations. Yet, the discovery is likely to stoke concern about what goes into the food supply. The melamine was found in products used to bind feed pellets together made by Tembec BTLSR of Ohio. The company said it added the melamine to increase the binding property of the ingredient, the FDA said. The Ohio concern is a subsidiary of the Canadian-based forest products giant of the same name. Tembec spokesman John Valley said the company thought it was making a "compliant product" because it wasn't intended for U.S. markets. However, the FDA said, one of the products for livestock feed &#8212; called Xtra-Bond &#8212; was primarily intended for domestic use, while two other recalled products, AquaBond and Aqua-Tec II, were largely intended for export. Neither the FDA nor the companies said how long Tembec had been adding melamine to the ingredients. Tembec has been a supplier to Uniscope since 2004, the companies said. The contamination was discovered by Uniscope of Johnstown, Colo., which makes and distributes binding agents for pelleted cattle, sheep, goat, fish and shrimp feed. That firm discovered the melamine after it tested ingredients that it got from Tembec, and notified the FDA on May 18. It said in a statement that Tembec added the melamine without its knowledge or consent. Tembec discontinued using melamine in April, after the pet food recalls, in response to the public concern and the high cost of melamine, Valley added. Ron Hardy, director of the Aquaculture Research Institute at the University of Idaho, said, "Nobody in the United States would think of using" fish feed that contained those chemicals. In the pet food recall, ingredients had melamine and byproduct concentrations that reached 20% of the product, said David Acheson, the FDA's assistant commissioner for food protection. Concentrations in the animal and fish feed were much lower. The FDA suspects melamine was added to make the pet food ingredients look richer in protein than they were. That does not appear to be the case with the Tembec ingredients, the FDA says. Tembec and Uniscope are cooperating in the investigation, it added.

A faulty bank fax printed a message that was misinterpreted as a bomb threat Wednesday, leading authorities to evacuate more than a dozen neighboring businesses and a day care center. The branch manager of the called police about 10 a.m. after receiving a fax containing images of a lit match and a bomb with a fuse, bank spokesman Ernesto Anguilla said. But text explaining the fax was an internal bank promotion failed to transmit. The missing text included the phrases "The countdown begins" and "Small business commitment week June 4-8," according to a copy circulated by police.

If completed, the deal will end a period of turmoil at , which has faced a campaign of criticism by large shareholders including William Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management and Ralph Whitworth of Relational Investors. THL and FNF are paying $36 a share in cash for Ceridian â€“ slightly more than the companyâ€™s closing value of $34.19 on Wednesday. The company said the purchase price was 17 per cent higher than its value in mid-February, when it announced the appointment of investment bankers at Greenhill to explore its options. THL and FNF are expected to bring co-investors into the deal, which is becoming a common practice in larger private equity takeovers as it allows buyers to maintain control while diluting risk. Mr Ackmanâ€™s reaction to the deal will be key to its fate. He could not be reached for comment last night. Relational sold its stake in Ceridian earlier this year.

The former media mogul is not expected to be called to the stand by defence lawyers. 2002 Black memo (.pdf) CP Video: Radler testimony, day 2 CP Video: Radler's first day Photos: Camera hits Amiel Black: In his own words Trial exhibits (DOJ site) Photos: Setting the scene A Conrad Black timeline Text of U.S. indictment (.pdf) Graphic: The trial (Flash) Video: Boxes episode, caught on tape Crime sheet: Lawyer's black trial blog Defence expected to take only one or two weeks, so verdict could be returned by the end of June May 31, 2007 04:30 AM CHICAGOâ€“After 43 days of testimony from 27 witnesses, prosecutors rested their case at the criminal trial of Conrad Black. Defence lawyers will take over today and Black's longtime executive assistant Joan Maida is expected to be the first witness. In a somewhat surprising twist after 11 weeks of prosecution witnesses, defence lawyers said yesterday that they would take just a week or two to present their evidence before the jury could begin deliberations. That could mean a verdict returned by the end of June. Black's lawyer Ed Genson said that he would take a little more than a full day to question all of the witnesses appearing on behalf of the besieged press baron. Black is not expected to be called to the stand. Also yesterday, prosecutors agreed to drop a count of money laundering against Black, but wouldn't elaborate on the reasons behind the decision. Gusts of chilly winter winds still blew through the downtown streets of Chicago when prosecutors opened their case against Black and three other Hollinger executives. "It was theft, it was fraud, it was crime," assistant U.S. attorney Jeffrey Cramer said in his opening statement. "Bank robbers wear masks and use a gun." Pointing to the Black and his co-defendants, Cramer remarked, "They dressed in ties and wore a suit." Since then, Cramer and other prosecution lawyers have guided a sometimes riveted, often snoozing, jury through a complicated thicket of details about the newspaper industry and non-compete agreements. Millions of dollars worth of non-compete payments, which prosecutors allege were misappropriated and should have remained with Hollinger International, form the crux of the government's case. In one agreement, Hollinger sold newspapers to a private company called Horizon that was controlled by Black and David Radler, the government's star witness who pleaded guilty and testified against Black. In the Horizon deal, Hollinger paid $1.2 million (U.S.) worth of non-competes to a closely held company that was also controlled by Black. "Black and Radler effectively paid themselves not to compete against themselves," assistant U.S. attorney Eric Sussman said during the trial. In at least one instance, Radler directed that non-compete money be paid to Black, himself and others even when he discovered that non-compete agreements did not exist. Prosecutors also plodded their way through details of Hollinger's juggernaut $3.5 billion (Canadian) sale of most of its Canadian newspapers to CanWest Global Communications Corp. in 2000. In that deal, the prosecution alleges that Black conspired to help co-defendants Peter Atkinson and Jack Boultbee receive non-compete money, even though CanWest had not asked that either sign such a pact. The prosecution also tried to show that Black has used company money to finance a lavish lifestyle for himself and his wife, Barbara Amiel. Prosecutors provided details of a $54,000 (U.S.) birthday party Black held for Amiel in 2000 at La Grenouille, a tony New York restaurant. When the bill for the party arrived, Black wrote to a colleague, "Let's call it one-third personal and two-thirds corporate." Radler, a self-described liar, testified that the dinner was solely a birthday celebration and that no businesses was conducted. Similarly, prosecutors spent several days questioning witnesses about a vacation Black and Amiel took in 2001 to Bora Bora. The cost of the trip was more than $500,000. Again, when the bill arrived, Black balked at paying. "No such outcome is acceptable," he wrote in an email that was introduced as evidence.

Lee Agrees to Buy Ceridian for $5.3 Billion (Update3) By Ian King and Rochelle Garner May 30 (Bloomberg) -- Thomas H. Lee Partners LP and Fidelity National Financial Inc. agreed to buy Ceridian Corp. for $5.3 billion after shareholders pressed the company for changes. Ceridian investors will receive $36 a share, the companies said in a statement. That&#39;s 5.3 percent more than today&#39;s close and 17 percent higher than the price on Feb. 12, the day before the company said it would explore strategic options. The buyers may have been attracted to Ceridian&#39;s Comdata unit, which processes electronic payments and has outperformed the company&#39;s human resources services business. Pershing Square Capital Management LP, Ceridian&#39;s biggest shareholder, had called for a spinoff of the division since January to boost its value. ``Ceridian has leading market positions in large, growing markets,&#39;&#39; Fidelity National Financial Chief Executive Officer William P. Foley said in the statement. The Comdata unit provides private-label credit-cards to national trucking fleets that let drivers charge necessities including gasoline and motel rooms. Comdata also sells so-called ``stored value&#39;&#39; products such as Starbucks Corp. gift cards. Ceridian&#39;s slower-growing human resources unit offers payroll processing, tax filing and benefits administration. Customers including drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc and chip- equipment company Teradyne Inc. use Ceridian to run programs such as employee wellness seminars. Ceridian shares gained 4.1 percent to $35.60 in extended trading after the announcement. They had advanced 47 cents to $34.19 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading and have added 22 percent this year. Pershing, a hedge fund founded by William Ackman, said on Jan. 18 it wanted Ceridian to spin off Comdata because its growth and cash flow have been diluted by other units that haven&#39;t performed as well. Ralph Whitworth&#39;s Relational Investors LLC joined the effort in February. The pressure led the Minneapolis-based company to hire financial and legal advisers to look at ways to boost its value. The company also has been fighting with Pershing over its May 14 firing of Gary Krow, who headed Ceridian&#39;s Comdata division, for disclosing confidential information to Pershing. Pershing said Krow&#39;s firing was part of a pattern by Ceridian of punishing whistleblowers. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating how the company deals with internal ethics complaints as well as its accounting practices. Retailers and transportation companies have been snapping up Comdata&#39;s cards and services amid efforts to focus on electronic payments. Growth in human resources services hasn&#39;t kept up, though the business serves 25 million employees and 110,000 companies in 38 countries, and benefits from long-term orders. On May 1, the company said sales from human resources services would rise at a rate in the ``mid-single digits,&#39;&#39; while Comdata&#39;s growth would be in the ``low to mid-teens&#39;&#39; this year. Since 2002, Ceridian&#39;s sales have grown an average of 7 percent a year and totaled $1.6 billion in 2006. Net income jumped 36 percent last year to $173.6 million. Chief Executive Kathryn Marinello took over the top job in October last year after joining Ceridian from General Electric Co. where she was head of that GE Fleet Services Corp. She owns 162,790 shares Ceridian shares, according to an Oct. 20 filing. Buyout firms globally have engaged in 954 deals this year valued at $432.5 billion, according to Bloomberg data, following last year&#39;s record $701.5 billion. Thomas H. Lee and Fidelity expect to bring co-investors into the transaction, according to the statement. Fidelity will own less than 50 percent of Ceridian, which ended the first quarter with $92.1 million of debt and had $377.3 million in cash and equivalents, according to a May 1 statement. Ceridian plans to hold its annual shareholder meeting by Sept. 21 and said shareholders can vote on the deal then. The purchase is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Founded in 1974, Thomas H. Lee has invested $12 billion in more than 100 businesses. The firm manages now manages about $20 billion, according to the statement. Fidelity National Financial, which provides insurance and claims management services, issues about 29 percent of all title insurance policies in the U.S. Greenhill & Co. and law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised Ceridian. Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. advised the buyout firms. Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are providing firm financing commitments to them, and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP is their legal adviser.

Exxon investors put exec pay above climate change By Michael Erman and Ed Stoddard, Reuters spent much of its annual meeting Wednesday defending its environmental policy, but shareholders of the world's largest company were more concerned with executive pay and governance practices. In all, 15 shareholder proposals were up for approval at the annual meeting. Although none received 50% of the shareholder vote, four dealing with pay and governance received at least 40%. All four measures would increase the accountability of Exxon's management and board for their policies and performance. About 47.8% of the shareholders backed a measure that would give holders of 10% of Exxon's outstanding common shares the right to call special shareholder meetings and 47.2% favored a proposal to allow the company to recoup incentive bonuses it determined were unjustified. Proposals to give shareholders an advisory vote on executive pay and to split the chief executive and chairman positions got 41.2% and 40% of the vote, respectively. But climate change was the central topic of discussion at the meeting and one environmental proposal &#8212; that the company adopt goals for greenhouse gas reductions from its products and operations &#8212; received 31% of the shareholder vote. Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson disputed claims by investor activists and environmentalists that the company is working to mislead the public about the causes of climate change. "What I find perplexing is why people feel threatened because we want to have a discussion," Tillerson said when offering an explanation for why the company funds some groups that are skeptical of the mainstream scientific views of climate change. "I'm not going to just adopt a slogan. If that makes me public enemy No. 1, so be it," he said. About three dozen protesters &#8212; outnumbered by police &#8212; staged a peaceful demonstration outside the meeting against the company's funding of groups they believe deny or distort the science of global warming. The protesters waved banners with slogans like "People Before Profits" and chanted "No More Junk Science." "ExxonMobil is double-crossing the public and policymakers. It's avoiding real changes and continuing to fund groups that purposefully distort the science of global warming," said Shawnee Hoover, the campaign director of Exxpose Exxon, a coalition of green and scientific groups. They say the company still funds about 40 organizations that the environmental group classified as "global warming deniers," shelling out more than $2 million to the groups in 2006. Exxon disagrees with the claim that the groups, many of which concern themselves with a wide range of issues, are "deniers of climate change." Scientists believe the use of fossil fuels causes global warming. Copyright 2007 Reuters Limited.

FIM, a division of News Corp, has ended the recent stand-off between MySpace and the US's most popular photo site by revealing they are set to join forces. The double acquisition had been expected for some time and was media earlier this month The deal will strengthen the FIM network's photo and video sharing capabilities and reaffirm MySpace's status as the number one social networking site. The Photobucket deal is expected to be the most lucrative, as it is already the 34th most visited website in the United States, with over 42 million users and 17 million monthly visitors. However, it hasn't exactly been plain sailing between FIM and Photobucket, after MySpace blocked Photobucket's embedded video and slide show widgets last month following a violation related to a Spider-Man 3 promotional campaign. The deal is thought to be worth around $250 million for Photobucket, while the relatively new site Flektor is rumoured to have sold for around $20 million. Photobucket co-founder Alex Welch told the Denver Post: "As we continued to build our services and our roadmap, it made sense to sit down and look at strategic options.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/31food.html&cid Melamine From U.S. Put in Feed - New York Times Melamine From U.S. Put in Feed Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 31, 2007 Ever since pet food contaminated with an industrial chemical was traced to shipments of wheat flour from China, American officials have concentrated on cracking down on imports. It turns out the problem was closer to home, too. Yesterday, federal officials announced that a manufacturing plant in was using the same banned substance, melamine, to make binding agents that ended up in feed for farmed fish, shrimp and livestock. The problem surfaced after a distributor, concerned about what was in its feed binders after the reports from China, sent the product to a private laboratory for testing. The melamine was used by BTLSR, a Canadian forest products company with a small chemical plant in Toledo, to make binding agents that keep pellets of animal feed together, said Dr. David Acheson, assistant commissioner for food protection at the Food and Drug Administration Melamine is not permitted in food or pet food products. In the last few months, pet food contaminated with melamine, all traced back to China, sickened or killed thousands of pets in the United States. Dr. Acheson said the levels of melamine and melamine-related compounds in Tembec&#8217;s products were far lower than that found in wheat flour from China that ended up killing the pets. Consequently, the authorities said that they thought the contamination did not appear to pose a risk to human health. Nevertheless, the F.D.A. issued a voluntary recall of finished feed made with two binding agents: Aquabond and Aqua-Tec II, which are made by Tembec and used in fish and shrimp feed. A third product, Xtra-Bond, which is made by a Colorado firm called Uniscope using Tembec ingredients, was not recalled because the levels of melamine were low. Uniscope is the distributor of all three products. Aquabond and Aqua-Tec II are sold mostly overseas; Xtra-Bond is sold domestically. Agency officials are alerting the foreign governments that received the products, Dr. Acheson said. The investigation began on May 18 when Uniscope alerted the agency that it had discovered melamine in the testing. Dr. Acheson said that the investigation was in its early stages and that some questions remained unanswered, like how long Tembec had used melamine in its products and the extent of the contamination. &#8220;What Tembec knew, didn&#8217;t know, what their activities were, is part of the investigation,&#8221; Dr. Acheson said, at a news conference. Earlier, he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to believe that a manufacturer of pet food would not know about this.&#8221; Federal officials would not say whether they would pursue criminal charges in the Tembec case. They said that they had already been contacting domestic manufacturers to make sure they were aware of the sources of their ingredients. John Valley, Tembec&#8217;s executive vice president for business development and corporate affairs, said his company thought that Uniscope was shipping the binders overseas for use as shrimp feed. Once the F.D.A. told it that the binders were being used domestically, Tembec stopped making them from melamine, Mr. Valley said. Tembec makes resins and certain chemicals for industrial uses, including melamine. Mr. Valley said Uniscope was the only customer that used its products for animal feed. Asked why it was all right to use melamine in feed for shrimp overseas but not in the United States, he said: &#8220;Melamine has just really had a focus that&#8217;s come upon it. A lot of companies and agencies are reviewing certain applications of melamine.&#8221; The pet food scandal has led to increased scrutiny of all food imports, particularly those from China, and threatened trade relations. Some members of Congress have demanded tougher inspections of food imports from China. &#8220;This recent incident goes to show that we apparently have some bad actors out there,&#8221; said Michael Doyle, director of the Center for Food Safety at the . &#8220;It can happen in the United States.&#8221; But Mr. Doyle pointed out that the incidence of food illness remains relatively rare in the United States. The problem with the Tembec binders surfaced after Uniscope, a company based in Johnstown, Colo., decided to test the binders. &#8220;They just asked themselves, &#8216;I wonder what&#8217;s in this stuff? I wonder if we have anything in here that shouldn&#8217;t be in here?&#8217; &#8221; said Charlie Russell, a company spokesman. &#8220;So they sent some samples to a lab.&#8221; Tembec has been a supplier to Uniscope since January 2004, Mr. Russell said. Employees at Uniscope, which was founded in 1975 and is family owned, thought that they were buying a resin that was fit for animal consumption, Mr. Russell said. Uniscope sells the binders to feed manufacturers that mix them with grain and other ingredients to make food pellets for livestock and fish, he said. The binders are sold both domestically and abroad, Mr. Russell said. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tembec acquired BTLSR Toledo, a custom manufacturer of spray-dry resins, for $8.5 million in 2003.

Federal prosecutors did not definitively resolve the probe of Ernst, one of the nation's four biggest audit firms, leaving open the prospect that the firm could be subject to possible financial penalties and other punishment. But high-ranking officials, including three lawyers, face more than a decade in prison if they are convicted. Ever had a losing investment? Learn anything from it?

We'd like to hear about misfortunes with any serious investments. Send your tale along with your name and phone number to: From The Post's Print Edition All of Today's Business Articles Today's Business Front Image Markets News and Research Save & Share Article Authorities singled out Robert Coplan, former director of Ernst's Center for Wealth Planning and a onetime official at the ; Martin Nissenbaum, who leads Ernst's personal income tax and retirement planning practice; Richard Shapiro, a tax partner; and Brian Vaughn, a former tax partner. Each of the men worked in an Ernst unit known as VIPER, an acronym for Value Ideas Produce Extraordinary Results. From 1998 to 2004, they helped wealthy individuals slash or eliminate taxes they owed by creating off-the-shelf tax products that brought Ernst millions of dollars, government lawyers said. Three of the men used a tax shelter in 2000 to evade their own taxes, according to Michael J. Garcia, the attorney in the Southern District of . In all, that shelter helped them and eight other Ernst executives skirt nearly $4 million in tax liabilities. Garcia said that activity by the Ernst executives "far exceeds the bounds of legitimate tax planning and reflects flagrant disregard of the law." Ernst &amp; Young, which paid $15 million to settle related allegations with the IRS in 2003, said it had long ago disbanded the unit involved in the shelter work. Two of the partners charged yesterday had been on paid administrative leave under the terms of the firm's partnership agreement since August 2006, according to Ernst spokesman Charles Perkins. Two others had already departed the firm. "Ernst & Young has cooperated with the government from the beginning of its investigation," the firm said in a statement. "We have voluntarily made many changes and enhancements to our tax practice." Each of the men pleaded not guilty in proceedings before a federal judge in New York yesterday afternoon. Lawyers for the executives said they were disappointed by the government's decision to proceed with the case. Ernst generated nearly $125 million in fees through the sale of four tax strategies mentioned in the indictment, prosecutors said. The executives allegedly worried about putting some of the deal terms in writing and leaving presentations in the hands of clients, according to memos and e-mail messages cited in the indictment. They allegedly worked in tandem with willing law firms that blessed the tax strategies in exchange for fees of $50,000 to $100,000 apiece. The deals were designed to look like money-losing investments that would create phony losses for people facing taxable income of $10 million or $20 million, according to the indictment. Coplan and Vaughn are also charged with misleading IRS investigators as part of a 2002 audit the agency conducted into Ernst's sale of tax shelters. Criminal charges against Ernst itself appear unlikely given recent decisions by federal prosecutors in New York, who expressed concern that an indictment could drive key accounting and law firms out of business. But the firm could face other sanctions. For instance, the government reached a $456 million settlement with accounting firm in 2005, but it has also filed criminal charges against 16 former officials there in a case that has yet to go to trial. Last week, Garcia announced he would not seek an indictment of law firm Sidley Austin for its role in approving abusive tax shelters for clients.

Motorola, which had already planned to complete 3,500 job reductions by June 30, on Wednesday forecast restructuring charges of about $300 million, or about 8 cents per share, over the rest of 2007 as a result of the latest lay-offs. A hostess holds a Motorola Z8 mobile phone at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona, February 15, 2007. Motorola Inc. reported a quarterly loss on Wednesday and gave a forecast that raised doubts over when the world's second-biggest mobile phone maker could turn around its business and return to profit. REUTERS/Albert Gea Email to a friend The company, which has been losing market share to rivals such as market leader Nokia due to a lack of advanced phones and tough price competition, had said in April that it would announce additional cost-cutting plans by June. The latest planned cuts at the company, which had 66,000 employees at the end of 2006, will be made by the end of the year, according to Motorola, which did not provide specifics on the break-down of the lay-offs. But while the job cuts will help with costs, Oppenheimer analyst Lawrence Harris said Motorola, which has been criticized for failing produce a hit to follow its popular Razr phone, would need better phone models to impress investors. "It will certainly help them return to profitability but it's not enough to get them to the double digit profit margins they seek," he said, adding: "They need exciting new products." Motorola's stock rose to $18.46 in after-hours trade following the news, up 1 percent from its close of $18.28 on the New York Stock Exchange. Schaumburg, Illinois-based Motorola forecast $600 million in annual cost savings in 2008 as a result of the latest job cuts, other spending controls and site rationalization. It said it was on target to save $400 million from the 3,500 lay-offs announced in January. The company also said there would be no adverse effect on customer service or product quality as a result of the cuts. "It's happening in all businesses functions and regions," company spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said of the cuts. "A lot is through normal attrition and some is through involuntary separation." She said Motorola would continue to hire in critical areas across the company. The company, which also makes network equipment and television set-top boxes, has said in recent months it was shifting the priorities of its phone business to improving profitability from gaining market share at all costs. In a separate statement, Motorola, which recently ended a bitter proxy battle with billionaire investor Carl Icahn, said on Wednesday that Icahn had won more than 43 percent of the votes for a seat on the board at its annual meeting in May. Motorola's preferred candidate, John White, was voted in over Icahn, the activist investor who had taken a stake of roughly 3 percent in the company in an effort to get onto its board.

Edwards for $6.8 Billion (Update5) May 31 (Bloomberg) -- Wachovia Corp. agreed to buy A.G. Edwards Inc., the 120-year-old securities firm, for $6.8 billion, doubling its sales staff as regional brokers struggle to remain independent amid declining revenue from trading stocks. The biggest purchase of a U.S. brokerage firm in almost seven years will pay A.G. Edwards holders $89.50 a share in cash and stock, or 16 percent more than yesterday&#39;s closing price, Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia said in a statement today. The takeover will create the second-largest U.S. brokerage firm after Merrill Lynch & Co., with almost 14,800 financial advisers. St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards, founded by a friend of former President Abraham Lincoln, has fallen behind in the competition for stock trades as investors turn to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS AG, Merrill and Morgan Stanley, which offer better prices. ``A.G. Edwards was a special firm, Midwest-oriented, fiercely proud of that, but we are in a different era,&#39;&#39; said Bruce Foerster, president of Miami-based South Beach Capital Markets. A.G. Edwards employs 6,618 financial advisers in 742 U.S. offices and two European locations. Wachovia Securities currently has 8,166 brokers and $773 billion of client assets. ``We knew we needed scale, we knew we needed additional products as financial services continue to migrate toward a global platform,&#39;&#39; A.G. Edwards Chief Executive Officer Robert Bagby said on a conference call. ``We could not provide that at A.G. Edwards. We didn&#39;t have the capital base.&#39;&#39; A.G. Edwards shares rose $10.47, or 14 percent, to $87.62 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at 11:40 a.m. The stock advanced 22 percent this year through yesterday, making it the second-best performer on the 12-member Amex Securities Broker/Dealer Index after TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. Shares of Wachovia fell 36 cents to $54.19. Shares of Raymond James Financial Inc. and other regional brokerages surged on speculation they may be taken over as well. Raymond James, based in St. Petersburg, Florida, gained 8 percent to $33.54. Stifel Financial Corp., A.G. Edwards&#39;s crosstown rival in St. Louis, climbed 7.8 percent, to $60.11. Wachovia CEO Kennedy Thompson expanded the company&#39;s reach into western states in October with the bank&#39;s largest takeover, a $24.2 billion acquisition of Golden West Financial Corp. That deal doubled the size of Wachovia&#39;s interest-rate sensitive mortgage portfolio. The A.G. Edwards purchase will help him boost revenue from more predictable fee income, and sell more retail bank products and investment-banking services to A.G. Edwards&#39;s brokerage clients. Fees will now account for about 50 percent of the bank&#39;s annual revenue, up from 45 percent, ``providing insulation&#39;&#39; from a narrowing in the gap between short- and long-term interest rates that has driven up Wachovia&#39;s costs to hold deposits, Goldman Sachs analyst Lori Appelbaum wrote in a note today to clients. The acquisition will be the fifth largest in Wachovia&#39;s history and the biggest for a U.S. brokerage since Zurich-based UBS bought New York-based Paine Webber Group Inc. in November 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wachovia is paying about 3.2 times the book value of A.G. Edwards, less than the 3.6 times that UBS paid for PaineWebber in 2000, Banc of America Securities analyst Michael Hecht wrote in a research note today. ``We&#39;re pleased,&#39;&#39; said Charles Bobrinskoy, vice chairman of Ariel Capital Management, A.G. Edwards&#39; third-biggest investor with about 2.9 million shares. ``The price is not overwhelming. It&#39;s good news, but it&#39;s not a great price.&#39;&#39; Traditionally a bank serving the U.S. Southeast, Wachovia expanded in the securities industry by merging with First Union Corp. in 2001 and acquiring Prudential Financial Inc.&#39;s brokerage unit in 2003. Wachovia Securities will shift its headquarters to St. Louis from Richmond, Virginia. Daniel Ludeman, 50, will continue to serve as president and CEO of Wachovia Securities, while Bagby, 63, will be chairman. The acquisition will add to earnings per share within the first year, excluding about $860 million in related expenses, Wachovia said. Annual cost savings will total $395 million annually after tax by 2009. Some of those savings will come from reducing by a quarter the companies&#39; combined 15,000 to 16,000 workers who aren&#39;t licensed Series 7 brokers, David Carroll, head of Wachovia&#39;s capital-management unit said in an interview. Wachovia will also close about 230 brokerage offices over a three-year period. The two companies plan to complete the transaction in the fourth quarter. ``Our take is that this is an attractive deal for Wachovia,&#39;&#39; Joseph Dickerson, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP in London, said in a note to clients. ``Though management have not quantified any revenue synergies, we see meaningful upside from several sources.&#39;&#39; Thompson said on the conference call that the bank will look to sell retail banking products and investment-banking services to A.G. Edwards&#39;s clients. ``This is truly a rare opportunity,&#39;&#39; said Thompson, who downplayed talk of more mergers after Wachovia&#39;s Golden West acquisition. The purchase ``will make us better able to withstand the ups and downs in equity markets.&#39;&#39; The acquisition, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, will exchange 0.9844 share of Wachovia stock and $35.80 in cash for each share of A.G. Edwards. Wachovia is entitled to a $270 million termination fee if the deal doesn&#39;t go through, it said in a regulatory filing. Wachovia&#39;s Carroll said in the interview he wouldn&#39;t ``speculate on someone lobbing in a higher offer&#39;&#39; for A.G. Edwards. ``We have the normal deal protections in here,&#39;&#39; he said. ``But economics is not the only driver of this deal.&#39;&#39; Prudential Financial, which currently owns 38 percent of Wachovia Securities, said it supports the deal. The company has a range of options regarding its Wachovia stake, Carroll said on the call, including adding more capital or ``putting&#39;&#39; its stake back to Wachovia. Credit Suisse and Wachovia Securities served as financial advisers to Wachovia on the transaction, while Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LP gave legal advice. Goldman Sachs and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised A.G. Edwards.

The public was told it was only wet and pouched food, that absolutely no dry pet food was involved. That was wrong.Â  Not only was dry pet food involved but so were dog biscuits and pet treats. Then it was pork, then chickens, then farm-fed fish.Â  But both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture tried to tell the public that there was minimal to no risk to the human food supply.Â  For the past two and half months since the recalls first began in mid-March with the nearly 100 brands of dog and cat recalled, the federal government has been busy downplaying the risk as more and more reports of contamination of the food supply for humans, pets, livestock and fish. Thousands of pets were killed and thousands more sickened and incapacitated from kidney failure.Â  Inanely, the contaminated pet food removed from the shelves was used to feed hogs, resulting in tainted pork. Now the FDA is alerting livestock and fish/shrimp feed manufacturers about a voluntary recall of products used in feed production because several have been found to contain melamine and related compounds. The FDA announced Wednesday that a source within the United States has been identified as producing a melamine-contaminated ingredient used in domestic livestock feed as well as in domestic and exported fish feed. This contamination is not considered to be related to the nationwide pet food recall that began March 16, according to the FDA. The feed ingredients were made by Tembec BTLSR Inc. of Toledo, Ohio and Uniscope, Inc. of Johnstown, Colo. Tembec, a contract manufacturer for Uniscope, makes AquaBond and Aqua-Tec II, which it distributes for Uniscope. Uniscope makes Xtra-Bond using ingredients supplied by Tembec. All of the products are binding agents that are used to make pelleted feed for cattle, sheep, and goats, or fish and shrimp. The companies have confirmed that Tembec added melamine as part of the formulation of the products to improve the binding properties of pelleted feed. Melamine is not approved as an additive for animal or fish/shrimp feed. The companies have stopped adding melamine to the feed products. Based on the levels of melamine and related compounds in the initial ingredients, FDA estimated the probable level of melamine and related compounds in livestock feed as less than 50 parts per million (ppm) based on the recommended mix rate of two to four pounds of binding agent per ton of livestock feed. The estimated levels in fish and shrimp feed are less than 233 ppm and 465 ppm, respectively, of melamine and related compounds. The estimated levels of melamine and related compounds vary in the livestock feed and the fish and shrimp feed because of differing levels of melamine in the binding agents used for each type of feed. FDA advises feed manufacturers and others who mix their own feed not to use these products, and to contact the manufacturers. FDA advises feed manufacturers to recall finished feed that is made from AquaBond or Aqua-Tec II due to the estimated levels of melamine and related compounds in the finished products. FDA believes that no recall is warranted of the finished feed made from Xtra-Bond based on the estimated levels of melamine and related compounds in the finished product and based on currently available data and information. The estimated melamine levels in feed made with these binding agents are similar to the levels discussed in the interim safety/risk assessment of melamine and related compounds made available by FDA earlier this month, says the FDA. Â In that assessment, federal â€œscientistsâ€ determined that, based on currently available data and information, the consumption of pork, chicken, domestic fish, and eggs from animals inadvertently fed animal feed contaminated with melamine and its analogues was unlikely to pose a human health risk, according to the FDA. FDA is encouraging domestic feed suppliers to be vigilant in quality control in their supply chain and to monitor for any improper additives, including melamine and its analogs. The Tembec and Uniscope products also reportedly contain a urea formaldehyde resin-type ingredient, a raw ingredient used to make the binding agent in these products. FDA is investigating this use of the urea formaldehyde resin-type ingredient in the Tembec and Uniscope products, and will take appropriate regulatory action if warranted. Earlier this month, Cereal Byproducts Company of Mt. Prospect announced that the FDA had determined that there are melamine and/or melamine derivatives in the rice protein concentrate produced by a single source Chinese supplier, Binzhou Futian Biology Technology Co. Lt. and purchased through a â€œlocalâ€ domestic importer.Â  FDA later said that it was wheat flour, not rice protein or wheat gluten which was the contaminated ingredient. The Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Co. Ltd., has also been identified as having exported the contaminated wheat flour containing melamine to the U.S. The managers of both of the Chinese companies which have been linked to the contaminated pet food which has killed and sickened thousands of cats and dogs in the U.S. and Canada, have been arrested. The head of Chinaâ€™s drug administration was sentenced to death Tuesday for accepting bribes to approve adulterated medicines including antibiotics which resulted in the deaths of six individuals and sickened scores more. The conviction and death sentenceÂ  for Zheng Ziaoyu, 63, former chief of the state Food and Drug Administration of China followed the international scandal about the tainted exports from the Chinese firms related to the pet food contamination and toothpaste with a potentially poisonous chemical addictive which was sold in Latin America. The Chinese companies had issued a statement that said that they had added melamine to the wheat gluten and rice protein in order to meet the contractual demand for protein levels.Â  Melamine is not approved as a food additive.Â  The companies said they only broke the law when they intentionally mislabeled the exported items to avoid inspection. Melamine is a molecule that has a number of commercial and industrial uses.Â  Other than a few limited authorizations for use in food contact materials for human food, melamine has no approved use as an ingredient in human or animal food in the U.S.Â  According to the Chinese government, Xuzhou Anying did not declare the contaminated wheat gluten (wheat flour) it shipped to the U.S. as a raw material for feed or food.Â  Rather, according to the Chinese government, it was declared to them as a non-food product, meaning that it was not subject to mandatory inspection by the Chinese government. Cereal Byproducts said it shipped the recalled product to a total of three customers located in the Midwest between July 19, 2006 and March 14, 2007. The FDA previously found melamine and/or melamine derivatives in Wilbur-Ellis Companyâ€™s rice protein concentrate, which was purchased from the same Chinese supplier as Cereal Byproducts. Cereal Byproducts proactively notified their customers of this finding, and thereafter both parties implemented their own voluntary recall of the contaminated products on or about April 19. Although Cereal Byproducts says it had received no confirmed cases of pet deaths, company officials said the voluntarily chose to initiate the recall when Cereal Byproducts discovered there was a potential contamination of melamine or melamine type derivatives. Cereal Byproducts had supplied rice protein concentrate to Royan Canin USA which on Friday announced its second recall, this time calling back right Sensible Choice dry food products and seven Kasco dry dog and cat food products. Â Royal Canin said it had found trace amounts of melamine in its products. FDA continues to assert that t he risk to human health is very low from eating meat from hogs and chickens that have been fed animal feed supplemented with pet food scraps containing melamine and related compounds, according to a risk assessment conducted by federal scientists. They say this conclusion supports the decision announced on April 28, not to recall meat from animals that were fed contaminated product. The FDA claimed that the pet food scraps fed to hogs and chickens made up only a small percentage of the farm animal rations. In addition, melamine is known to be excreted in animal urine, and believed not to accumulate in the body of animals. When exposure levels are much higher, as was the case with cats and dogs, the melamine and its compounds appear to cause the formation of crystals in the kidney systems, resulting in kidney damage. There was no indication of kidney damage in hogs. Both hogs and chickens known to have been fed contaminated feed appear to be healthy.

The US government withdrew one of the 14 charges without explanation, as it wrapped up 11 weeks of evidence against the fallen media baron and three of his associates. Lord Black's lawyers have indicated that they will call only a few witnesses and could take barely a week to set out their defence, suggesting that they do not plan to risk putting the famously pompous peer on the stand. That in turn suggests they are confident that the prosecution has failed to build the cast-iron case that would require such a desperate last roll of the dice. Observers said that the prosecution has failed to present evidence that would allow the technical charge of money laundering to stick. Lord Black still faces 13 counts of fraud, racketeering and obstruction of justice, which could put him in jail for the rest of his life. The prosecution yesterday called their final witnesses after painting Lord Black as a fraudster who treated his US-quoted newspaper company, Hollinger International, as a personal piggy bank, to the detriment of outside shareholders. As well as living high on on company expenses, the peer cooked up a string of bogus "non-compete" agreements that allowed him and his associates to pocket $60m in illegal payments, the prosecution claimed. Hollinger's independent board members &shy; including the former governor of Illinois, Jim Thompson and the Canadian economist Marie-Josee Kravis &shy; testified that they did not know that such large sums were being diverted to Lord Black and the three other defendants, Jack Boultbee, Mark Kipnis and Peter Atkinson. And David Radler, Lord Black's right-hand man for more than three decades, said that he and Lord Black had dreamed up the idea of using non-compete payments as a way of sheltering bonuses from tax and to pay off debts at their other companies. Testifying as part of a plea deal that gives him a lenient 29-month term in a Canadian jail, Mr Radler was attacked by defence attorneys as a liar out to save his own skin. While Mr Radler repeatedly insisted that he had initially denied wrongdoing in order to protect Lord Black, Edward Greenspan, Lord Black's lawyer, forced him to admit that he had double-crossed Lord Black in other business dealings. Steven Skurka, a veteran defence attorney who has been observing the trial as a commentator for Canadian television, repeated his assertion that Lord Black will be acquitted, citing the defence team's performance in cross-examining the main witnesses, in particular their success in getting Mr Thompson to admit that he had only "skimmed" important documents. "Conrad Black is the uncontrollable waterfall. The prosecution's job is to do enough to force him to testify. I don't think that they have done enough, and as I result I think they will ultimately lose the case," Mr Skurka said. However, that is by no means a universal view among representatives of the dozens of media organisations from the US, the UK and Canada that have descended on Chicago to cover the trial. Others believe that the prosecution's vivid evidence of Lord Black's lavish personal spending on expenses will prove more persuasive to the blue-collar, mainly female jury than the non-compete deal paperwork. Eddie Genson, Lord Black's Chicago-based attorney, has repeatedly asked the judge to declare a mistrial because of what he says is the prosecution's pandering to "class prejudice". The peer has vowed to sue all his accusers "when" he is acquitted. He has loudly defended himself outside the court, in a round of media interviews to publicise his new biography of Richard Nixon, during which he has insisted that the prosecution case against him is a tissue of lies. The judge, Amy St Eve, was so incensed at Lord Black's public statements that she told the defence team to "restrain" him, or she would do it for them. Lord Black and his associates cooked up a scheme to pay themselves $5.5m by promising not to set up a newspaper in the tiny mountain town of Mammoth in California - a promise they had no difficulty in keeping, since they already owned the only paper there. Prosecutors brandished a copy of the Mammoth Times to illustrate that the non-compete clauses signed by Lord Black were sham agreements meant only to disguise massive bonus payments. Jurors were shown the sumptuous menu for the surprise 60th birthday party thrown by Lord Black for his wife at the lavish New York restaurant La Grenouille in December 2000. The $62,870 bill, it was revealed, included a $14,847 drinks tab. Beluga caviar was among the starters. Hollinger picked up two-thirds of the tab. The Park Avenue apartment Lord Black ordered a $2.1m refurbishment for his New York apartment, spending $5,300 on heated towel rails, $6,000 on shower doors and $7,000 on window sashes - and then made up for the expense by buying the apartment from Hollinger at $3m below the market price. Hollinger also paid for a servants' quarters. Hollinger's company jet was routinely used by Lord Black and his wife for personal trips. Prosecutors have charged him with defrauding outside shareholders by paying only half the $565,326 cost of a round-trip flight to the South Pacific idyll of Bora Bora. The jury was shown grainy CCTV footage of Lord Black, his personal assistant and chauffeur loading 13 boxes of documents into his limousine on the same day that prosecutors say he was told to hand over documents to US regulators.

Lawyers for Lord Black, who still faces more than a dozen charges relating to racketeering, obstruction of justice, mail, wire and tax fraud, said they would take just over two days to rebut 11 weeks of prosecution evidence. The apparent brevity of the defence case indicates that Lord Black himself will probably not be called to testify. This suggests that Lord Black's defence team is either confident that the prosecution's case is not strong enough, or, that it may be too risky to subject the former Telegraph owner to cross-examination over the $60m case. Lord Black's lawyers intend to put their case early next week. The prosecution's case ended with lawyers showing bank statements indicating Lord Black had spent millions on diamonds and jewellery for his wife. Earlier this week, the prosecution case levelled a number of other accusations against Lord Black. Lawyers argued obstruction of justice relating to CCTV footage of 13 boxes Lord Black allegedly removed from the company's headquarters in defiance of a court order. Further accusations centred on a Park Avenue flat bought by Hollinger International for Lord Black in 1994, which the prosecution argued was worth millions more than the amount he subsequently paid to buy it six years later. Lord Black said he spent several million dollars renovating the apartment. Lord Black and three other former executives of Hollinger International are charged with swindling the newspaper holding company out of millions of dollars through the sale of Hollinger assets. The alleged scheme began with a decision in the late-90s by Lord Black, who was the company's chairman, to sell hundreds of small Hollinger-owned community newspapers across the US and Canada. Millions of dollars were paid to Hollinger in exchange for promises that it would not go into competition with the new owners of the papers. Prosecutors have claimed Lord Black and two of his co-defendants, former Hollinger vice-presidents John Boultbee and Peter Y Atkinson, illegally diverted much of the money to themselves with help from corporate counsel Mark Kipnis. Mr Kipnis also is on trial. All four of the defendants maintain that they did nothing illegal. To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email or phone 020 7239 9857.

Miller Published May 31, 2007, 8:02 AM CDT Sears Holdings Corp.'s fiscal first-quarter net income showed a solid increase -- thanks to a number of one-time gains -- but the retail giant's underlying profits were flat, the company said today. "In part, our domestic operating results reflect the impact of some of the same challenges being faced by our customers, such as rising energy costs and a slowing housing market," said President and Chief Executive Officer Aylwin Lewis. For the quarter ended May 5, net income at the Hoffman Estates company was $216 million, or $1.40 a diluted share, up from the year-ago period's $180 million, or $1.14 a share. Sears' revenues slipped slightly to $11.70 billion from $12.0 billion. But excluding the impact of onetime special items, Sears pointed out, per-share earnings dipped to $1.10 from $1.11 a year ago. In the latest quarter, the company enjoyed a 12-cent-a-share gain from a legal settlement; an 11-cent-a-share gain from curtailment of certain post-retirement benefits for workers at its Sears Canada affiliate; and an aggregate 14-cent gain related to a dividend from Sears Mexico and hurricane-related recoveries. Partially offsetting those gains was an 8-cent-a-share loss on certain financial "swap" investments that Sears chairman and controlling stockholder Eddie Lampert routinely makes using the company's cash flow. Those investments have often yielded big gains for Sears, but in the latest quarter they served as a drag on profits. On an operating basis, Sears noted that profits declined at its Kmart unit, with sales weakening "most notably" in home goods, health and beauty products, and food. At the company's Sears outlets, sales at stores open at least twelve months showed a decline -- in part because of weaker home appliance sales, which the company said "reflects both a slower U.S. housing market and the impact of increased competition."

Yahoo said its co-founder, Jerry Yang, would assume Mr. Nazem’s responsibilities while it searches for a replacement. The departure of Mr. Nazem, 45, who is known as Zod, will follow a turbulent year at Yahoo that included a companywide revamping. Several other senior executives, including the chief operating officer, have left in the wake of the overhaul. Yahoo would not make Mr. Nazem or any other executive available to discuss his departure. But a spokeswoman, Joanna Stevens, said that Mr. Nazem had wanted to retire and that he and the chief executive, Terry S. Semel, had been planning his departure for some time. Writing in the company’s , Mr. Nazem said, “As I began contemplating retirement, there were a few milestones that I (along with the executive leadership team) wanted to accomplish prior to my departure.” Those milestones, he wrote, included the reorganization of the company and its technology group, as well as the introduction of an advertising platform, known as Project Panama, which Yahoo began introducing in February. “It was very important to me,” Mr. Nazem said, “to drive all the way to my last day here at Yahoo without distractions of an announcement like this.” The new advertising platform is aimed at narrowing the lead of in online advertising, but it has yet to translate into financial gains for the company. Mr. Nazem, who is responsible for the operation of the Yahoo Web site and for product development, was popular among the company’s technology ranks, whom he largely helped hire. This month, Yahoo appointed Blake Jorgensen, a founder of Thomas Weisel Partners, as chief financial officer, replacing Susan L. Decker, who is switching roles to become head of the company’s advertiser and publisher group. Yahoo is looking for an executive to lead its audience group, which is responsible for much of the main company Web site. After Mr. Nazem’s departure, Yahoo is likely to have vacant positions at the top of two of its three operating units. As part of his separation agreement, Mr. Nazem will receive a lump sum equal to his base salary for the rest of the year as well as accelerated vesting of stock options and stock awards, a package that an executive compensation firm, Equilar, estimated around $6.9 million.

Click me to Chemical that led to pet food recall used by US company for animal feed A Chinese man looks at samples of grains including wheat and rice from a northern Chinese agricultural company that is on display at a food fair in Shanghai, 10 May 2007. China acknowledged for the first time, that it was the source of deadly additives found in US pet foods and that two companies illegally added melamine to the wheat gluten and rice protein. Photograph by : AFP/Getty Images Published: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 WASHINGTON â€” The same industrial chemical that led to a massive pet food recall was used by a U.S. manufacturer of ingredients for feeding livestock, fish and shrimp, health officials said Wednesday. The announcement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was the first indication that an American company had used melamine as an animal feed ingredient. Previously, the problem was thought to be contained to China, where manufacturers had added melamine to wheat flour, which was then added to animal feed. Melamine is not approved as an additive for the feed. It has a number of industrial uses, including as a binding agent and flame retardant. Itâ€™s also used as fertilizer in some parts of the world, but not in the U.S. U.S. officials said the use of melamine in animal feed posed no threat to human health. They said that melamine and related compounds were used to bind feed pellets for cattle, sheep and goats, or fish and shrimp. In China, they said, the chemical was probably added to show greater levels of protein. The FDA alerted feed manufacturers that ingredients containing melamine and related compounds were found in products made by Tembec BTLSR Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, and used by Uniscope Inc. of Johnstown, Colo. Tembec, a subsidiary of the Montreal-based forestry giant,Â  makes two products, AquaBond and Aqua-Tec II, which it distributes for Uniscope. The products are used in fish feed. Uniscope also makes a product for livestock feed called Xtra-Bond, and it uses ingredients produced by Tembec. The FDA advised feed manufacturers and others not to use the products and to contact the two manufacturers. Officials said they had no idea how much feed contains the tainted ingredients. Calls to Tembec for comment were not immediately returned. Canadian killed in Afghanistan A Canadian soldier died Wednesday night when the American helicopter he was aboard...

This drug has been found to prolong the survival of advanced renal carcinoma patients by about 3 Â½ months, according to a study led by Gary R. Hudes, M.D., director of the Genitourinary Malignancies Program at Fox Chase Cancer Center. The study has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine. A total of 626 patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were enrolled in the study and were subjected to one of the following three treatments â€“ the new drug Torisel, an older drug called interferon, or both the drugs together. The patients who received Torisel alone survived longer than those who received interferon, the usual or â€˜standardâ€™ treatment for this disease. According to this study, the greatest increase in median survival was observed in patients receiving Torisel (49 percent) compared with patients treated with interferon only. Patients treated with Torisel and interferon combined had a 15 percent increase in median survival compared with interferon alone. The median survival for Torisel alone was 10.9 months compared with and 8.4 months for the Torisel and interferon, and 7.3 months for the interferon. "This is the first study to show that a new drug can improve overall survival for patients with metastatic renal cell cancer," said Hudes. Renal Cell Carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer, accounting for about 90% of all adult kidney cancer cases diagnosed in the U.S. Many patients with kidney cancer opt for a surgery to remove the tumor. However, about 35% of them experience either a recurrence of the tumor or its spread to other organs. â€œFor these patients, the goal of treatment is to prevent further spread and growth of the cancer, and ideally, to reduce that amount of cancer," Hudes said. "Until recently, physicians lacked effective drugs to control the disease." The drug Torisel is basically an enzyme inhibitor, a protein that regulates cell production, growth and survival. Temsirolimus blocks the function of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key protein within cells regulating cell proliferation, growth and survival. It has also been found to block angiogenesis, the process to create a blood supply to tumors in order to maintain their growth. This is the third drug for kidney cancer to be approved by FDA since late 2005, the earlier two being Bayerâ€™s Nexavar, or sorafenib and Pfizer Inc.'s Sutent, or sunitinib. Common side effects of Torisel include rash, fatigue, mouth sores, nausea, edema and a loss of appetite. Common laboratory abnormalities associated with the drug are high blood sugar, elevated blood lipids and tryglycerides, low RBC, WBC and platelet counts. Also, this study focused on patients with the most advanced tumors. According to Hudes, Torisel can be expected to provide greater benefits to patients with less extensive metastatic disease. Wyeth, in a statement, said its drug would be available for patients in July. The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

Fill out this form to email this article to a friend Spain sues Odyssey Marine Nation files claims against three wrecks found by treasure hunters. Published May 31, 2007 Spain filed suit Wednesday against Tampa&#39;s Odyssey Marine Exploration, and not just over a 17th-century shipwreck it promised to claim earlier this week. Maritime lawyer James Goold said Spain filed claims against three wrecks the Tampa treasure-hunting company has discovered: an Italian-registered passenger boat found last year in the Mediterranean, an unidentified vessel located in March west of Gibraltar, and a 17th-century ship -- code-named "Black Swan" -- whose rich yield of 500, 000 silver coins this month drew international attention and nearly doubled Odyssey&#39;s stock price. "Spain&#39;s legal action this week is based on the same legal principles that resulted in the return of all materials in the Juno and La Galga case, " said Goold, an attorney with Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C. In the Juno case, also argued by Goold, a U.S. court ordered a salvage company to return the treasures it removed from two 18th-century Spanish frigates without that country&#39;s authorization. Spain believes the so-called Black Swan may have sunk in 1641 while under contract with the King and carrying Spanish funds. It&#39;s not clear how strong a legal case Spain may have. Odyssey spokeswoman Natja Igney said it is premature to assess the merit of Spain&#39;s Black Swan claim without knowing the ship&#39;s identity and added that Odyssey expects to reap a substantial salvage award regardless of who claims it. "You are playing right into the hands of lawyers that are trying to sensationalize a straightforward legal proceeding, and further encouraging this type of behavior, " she said. But combined with Spain&#39;s involvement over a fourth shipwreck - its Andalucia region continues to stymie Odyssey&#39;s efforts to excavate a ship it believes to be the 17th-century British warship HMS Sussex, which may have sunk with cargo worth billions of dollars today - the country&#39;s multipronged interventions threaten to prolong Odyssey&#39;s cash crunch by delaying the conversion of treasures into actual revenues. According to its most recent financial report, Odyssey began 2007 with just $2.4-million in cash and burned through $4.7-million during the first quarter. What saved it was a complex $6.6-million equity transaction with some of its top shareholders. Last June, Odyssey refinanced the $1.8-million mortgage on its Tampa headquarters with a $2.5-million loan. Igney, the company spokeswoman, said Odyssey won&#39;t have to seek financing for several months, thanks to $7.7-million generated this month when a shareholder exercised some warrants. Still, cash crunches are nothing new at Odyssey, which seeks to be the first publicly traded shipwreck-recovery company to generate consistent earnings. In prior years, the company sold stakes in specific wrecks or issued them to contractors in lieu of cash. The company&#39;s first major find, the U.S. Civil War-era SS Republic in 2003, generated an unprecedented $75-million in revenues that nevertheless were swiftly consumed by Odyssey&#39;s multiple search-and-recovery projects. Under U.S. District Court rules, Spain has 20 days to issue a specific response to each of Odyssey&#39;s three shipwreck claims. Odyssey&#39;s stock fell five cents Wednesday to $6.80 per share. Since leaping 81 percent to close at $8.32 on May 18, the day it announced its Black Swan find, the company&#39;s stock price has fallen 18 percent.

But Odyssey is not a crack dealing company but a company with pride and dignity, SPAIN is JEALOUS Typical 2nd rate spain. They are always wanting to take something from others.

Agrees to Buy Photobucket, Flektor Sites (Update3) By Tim Mullaney and Cecile Daurat May 30 (Bloomberg) -- News Corp. agreed to buy Photobucket Inc. and Flektor Inc. to give users of its MySpace social- networking Web site tools to manage digital pictures. Both sites will be added to News Corp.&#39;s Fox Interactive Media unit, the New York-based company said today in a statement. News Corp. didn&#39;t disclose the price, which UBS AG analyst Michael Morris said may be as much as $300 million. ``It makes a lot of sense,&#39;&#39; Morris said. The two sites offer MySpace technology to upgrade its video and picture capabilities and stay current with young users. ``It gives them protection against obsolescence,&#39;&#39; he said. Photobucket and Flektor, along with Google Inc.&#39;s YouTube and Yahoo! Inc.&#39;s Flickr, are capitalizing on the growth of inexpensive digital cameras and high-speed Internet connections. More than 30 million people worldwide visited Photobucket&#39;s Web site in March, almost twice the number a year earlier, according to the research firm ComScore Inc. MySpace accounts for about 40 percent of the links to photos on Photobucket, said Peter Levinsohn, head of Fox Interactive Media unit. The company will continue to operate as a standalone business and News Corp. will help it expand outside the U.S., he said. Photobucket Chief Executive Officer Alex Welch, who will remain with the company as president of the site, said Fox Interactive Media was ``a natural choice&#39;&#39; for Photobucket. News Corp. Class A shares rose 24 cents to $22.43 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have risen 4.4 percent this year. News Corp., led by Rupert Murdoch, is also trying to buy Dow Jones & Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal, for $5 billion. The company bought MySpace for $580 million in October 2005. The site had 107.7 million visitors in March, more than double a year earlier, ComScore said. ``We have an aggressive acquisition strategy,&#39;&#39; Levinsohn said. Photobucket hired Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. to evaluate a sale of the company last year. In May 2006, the company raised $10.5 million from Trinity Ventures and Insight Venture Partners. Flektor provides users with tools to edit and arrange photos and video clips for presentation to others or for posting on blogs and other Web sites. Started last year, Flektor is based in Culver City, California. Photobucket generates most of its revenue from advertising. Users who pay a subscription fee of $25 a year get more storage for their pictures and don&#39;t have to see the ads. ``This gives News Corp. a foot in the door to get MySpace users accustomed to the pay model,&#39;&#39; said New York-based Morris, who rates the shares ``buy&#39;&#39; and doesn&#39;t own any.

Lee Partners and insurance company Fidelity National Financial Inc. for $5.3 billion, the business services company said on Wednesday. Ceridian had been battling with Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund and major shareholder, which wanted the company to spin off its Comdata division and replace its board. Pershing told Ceridian in a letter earlier this year that the company had "underperformed and failed to achieve its business potential for more than a decade." Ceridian said in a statement on Wednesday it had conducted a "comprehensive review process" in which it evaluated a "number of strategic alternatives available" including options related to Comdata. The all-cash $36-a-share deal is a premium of about 17 percent to Ceridian's closing share price on Feb. 12, the last trading day before it said it retained Greenhill & Co. as financial advisers to explore strategic alternatives. It said the previous month it had hired a financial adviser to help review its business, including a possible Comdata spin-off. Minneapolis-based Ceridian's main human resources outsourcing division offers payroll, benefits administration, and other services to companies. Comdata offers payment processing and is an issuer of credit cards and debit cards. Jacksonville, Florida-based Fidelity National Financial provides title insurance. Title insurance, commonly offered in the United States, gives buyers and lenders protection against defects in a property that later may come to light -- such as a third party having a prior ownership claim on that property. Ceridian's shares closed at $34.19 on Wednesday. The deal is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Sources previously told Reuters that Pershing founder William Ackman felt he and other shareholders stood to make significantly more money should Ceridian be split up rather than sold. In addition to pressure from Pershing, activist investment firm Relational Investors had also been agitating for changes at Ceridian. Relational founder Ralph Whitworth in February wrote to Ceridian and said investors were not satisfied with its performance. But in an April interview, Whitworth said Relational had sold all its Ceridian shares, saying he had "bigger fish to fry." Pershing could not be immediately reached for comment on Wednesday's deal.

The cutback follows a similar move early this month, bringing the total of technology services layoffs at IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., to 3,023 in the second quarter and 3,720 since the start of the year. The cuts amount to roughly 1 percent of IBM's global workforce. In Massachusetts, where the company is one of the largest private employers in the technology industry, IBM issued layoff notices to 72 of its 5,000 employees yesterday. Last month, the company idled 16 employees in the state, bringing its total employment cuts for the quarter to 88, or about 1.6 percent of its Bay State workforce. Most of the state layoffs were in IBM's services group, though a small number were in software and sales, said IBM spokeswoman Elena Fernandez . She said the job cuts reflect an ongoing shift in technology services, where IBM still has a $115 billion backlog. "The nature of the services business is one where there's regular turnover," Fernandez said. "We're always looking to make things more efficient and cost effective, and there's an element of automating." Technology services leaders like IBM and , which design and provide specialized software and business processes for other businesses and consult with them on efficiencies, have been struggling to fend off price competition from Indian outsourcing firms, analysts said. Toward that end, the global providers have been building up their own low-cost sourcing networks in India and elsewhere. Even as IBM has eliminated more than 3,700 services jobs this year, it has hired 19,000 employees . The company would not give a geographic breakdown of where new employees are being hired. "Clearly, this is part of an ongoing attempt by IBM to alter its skill sets and cost structure by moving some implementation resources offshore," suggested Michele J. Cantara , a vice president for research at technology research firm Of the IBM employees in Massachusetts, where the company has grown through acquisition over the past decade, more than two-thirds work in software development, with the rest in sales and services. IBM operations in Cambridge, Lexington, Westford, and Marlborough together make up its largest software cluster in the world.

The lawsuit charges that flight services provided by Jeppesen Dataplan Inc. enabled the clandestine transportation of the suspects to secret overseas locations, where they were tortured and subjected to other "forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment." The ACLU said the company "either knew or reasonably should have known" that they were facilitating the torture of terrorism suspects by providing flight services for the CIA. Companies "are not allowed to have their heads in the sand, and take money from the CIA to fly people, hooded and shackled, to foreign countries to be tortured," ACLU attorney Ben Wizner said. Boeing itself is not named in the lawsuit and would not confirm the reports of a Jeppesen-CIA link, said spokesman Tim Neale, adding that customers have a confidentiality clause. Jeppesen Dataplan says it provides services such as flight plans, fuel and airport data to airlines, private pilots and various companies, but it doesn't ask its customers for details of their business. "We don't know the purpose of the trip for which we do a flight plan," said Mike Pound, a spokesman for the Englewood, Colo.-based Jeppesen. "We don't need to know specific details. It's the customer's business, and we do the business that we are contracted for," he said. "It's not our practice to ever inquire about the purpose of a trip." Jeppesen had no immediate comment on specifics of the lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Northern California, but announced in New York City. The three detainees have claimed through their family and lawyers that they have been tortured and abused against universally accepted legal standards. One claimed to have been routinely tortured under interrogation about al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. Their attorneys appealed to the ACLU for assistance. The cases involve the alleged mistreatment of Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian citizen, in July 2002 and January 2004; Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen, in May 2002; and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian citizen, in December 2001, ACLU officials said at a Manhattan news conference. Mohamed is currently being held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Britel in Morocco and Agiza in Egypt, the ACLU said. The ACLU says the suspects were apprehended under the U.S. government's "extraordinary rendition program." Extraordinary rendition is the clandestine capture and transfer of suspects to be detained and interrogated in countries where the protection of U.S. laws do not apply, according to Wizner. "American corporations should not be profiting from a CIA rendition program that is unlawful and contrary to core American values," said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU. "Corporations that choose to participate in such activity can and should be held legally accountable." Neither the CIA nor the U.S. government is named in the lawsuit. Wizner said the executive branch has evoked a state secrets defense in similar lawsuits. The Bush administration has insisted it receives guarantees from countries receiving terror suspects that prisoners will not be tortured.

Consumating a long-rumored deal, Internet auctioneer eBay agreed on Wednesday to acquire social bookmarking site StumbleUpon for $75 million. The popular San Francisco, California-based startup, with almost 2.5 million users and growing by 150 percent annually, allows users to approve or disapprove of websites and then guides them to other sites that users with similar tastes have recommended. A bulletproof method for spending hours of time web surfingâ€”5 million recommendations are made dailyâ€”StumbleUpon provides users with an easy and community-oriented way of discovering new and unexpected sites. In December, StumbleUpon added a video tool, called an â€œin-browser televisionâ€ by one observer, which randomly guides users to videos posted to a variety of websites. StumbleUpon, founded in 2001, has reportedly received $1.5 million in seed financing. It is not immediately clear how StumbleUpon will be integrated into San Jose, California-based eBay. Previous acquisitions, such as Paypal and Skype, were more directly related to eBayâ€™s market-leading Internet auction business. Buyers and sellers had been using Paypal to conduct transactions and Skype was seen as a cheap way to communicate with faraway buyers or sellers. One blogger argued that StumbleUpon would enable eBay to circumvent search giant Google, by embedding a StumbleUpon search box into its Skype client. However, StumbleUpon, with its rapidly growing user base, seems a quick way to acquire a complementary social networking community in what could be a strategy to expand beyond its marketplace roots. An eBay user can already rate another buyer or seller, or see their past purchases, but StumbleUpon could theoretically help eBay users also see buyersâ€™ favorite web sites, view their pictures and add other eBay users to oneâ€™s StumbleUpon â€œfriends.â€ This builds more page views and traction at eBay and makes it more of a regular destinationâ€”or perhaps even a social networking siteâ€”rather than just a place to buy stuff. And eBay could also recommend products based on oneâ€™s friends. $280M acquisition follows moves on Wallstrip.com, Joost, Spot Runner. BuzzLogic and Visible Technologies competitor gets seed round.

Click me to Spain stakes claim to colonial-era treasure ship found by Florida company In this photo provided by Odyssey Marine Exploration, Ground crew members unload more than 17 tons of silver coins May 16 at an undisclosed location.. (AP Photo/Odyssey Marine Exploration, Jonathan Blair) Phil Davis, Canadian Press Published: Thursday, May 31, 2007 TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - The Spanish government has filed claims in U.S. federal court over a shipwreck that a Florida company found laden with colonial-era treasure, a lawyer said Thursday. If the vessel was Spanish or was removed from that country's waters, any treasure would belong to Spain, said James Goold, a lawyer representing the Madrid government. "It's a very well established principle under Spanish, U.S. and international law that a government such as the kingdom of Spain has not abandoned its sunken ships or sunken property, and that a company like Odyssey Marine Exploration may not conduct recovery operations without authorization by the government," he said. "The kingdom of Spain has not authorized any such operations by Odyssey, and by these legal actions it will see the return of any Spanish property Odyssey has recovered," Goold said of the claims filed Wednesday. Odyssey officials were not available for comment. Odyssey announced two weeks ago that it had discovered a shipwreck containing 500,000 gold and silver coins somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. At the time, Odyssey estimated the value of the find at some US$500 million. Rare-coin expert Nick Bruyer, who was contracted by Tampa-based Odyssey Marine Exploration to examine a batch of coins from the wreck, has described the find as "unprecedented." "I don't know of anything equal or comparable to it," he said in an interview earlier this month. The Tampa-based company said the site was outside any country's territorial waters but would not give the exact location or name of the ship. Odyssey has said that the ship was not in Spanish territorial waters and was not the HMS Sussex, a shipwreck that Odyssey recently got permission from the Spanish government to search for in the Strait of Gibraltar. But Spain has called the new discovery suspicious and said the booty may have come from a wrecked Spanish galleon. In Britain, the find generated press reports that Odyssey had salvaged the wreck of the long-sought British vessel Merchant Royal, which sank in bad weather off England in 1641. Odyssey has not confirmed or denied these reports. Spain is using the U.S. law firm Covington & Burling, which has represented Spain over shipwreck cases before, including the recovery of material from two ships, Juno and La Galga, in a 2000 court case. The Spanish government won that case. Previously the richest-ever shipwreck haul was from the Spanish galleon Nuestra Senora de Atocha, which sank in a hurricane off the Florida Keys in 1622. Treasure-hunting pioneer Mel Fisher found it in 1985, retrieving a reported $400 million in coins and other loot.

Sales at Kmart and Sears stores open at least a year fell 3.9 percent as shoppers curbed purchases of home appliances and health products. Revenue declined 2.5 percent to $11.7 billion, Sears said today in a statement. Comparable-store sales have fallen every quarter since Chairman Edward Lampert joined Sears with Kmart in March 2005 in a $12.3 billion union. Lampert, 44, said earlier this month that fixing retail operations was ``a priority&#39;&#39; for the company. ``They have to take a page out of J.C. Penney&#39;s playbook and revitalize the brands and improve sales,&#39;&#39; said Arun Daniel, who helps manage $40 billion, including Sears shares, at ING Investments LLC in New York. ``That takes time.&#39;&#39; Net income climbed to $216 million, or $1.40 a share, from $180 million, or $1.14, a year earlier. One-time items lifted profit by $44 million, or 30 cents a share, in the three months through May 5. Excluding the gains and charges, the company said it earned $1.10 a share, trailing analysts&#39; estimates of $1.21 a share, the average of seven projections compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, fell $4.35, or 2.4 percent, to $178.90 at 9:39 a.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. They have gained 6.5 percent this year. Same-store sales fell 3.4 percent at the Sears division on sluggish demand for home appliances, which the company attributed to a U.S. housing slump and higher energy prices. Kmart&#39;s same-store sales declined 4.4 percent on lower sales in home goods, health care and most other merchandise categories. Kmart shoppers may have reduced purchases because of higher gasoline prices and poor weather, the company said. Sears earned $18 million after-tax from the legal settlement of a contractual dispute, $16 million from amendments to Sears Canada&#39;s post-retirement benefit plans, a $12 million dividend from an investment in Mexico and $9 million in insurance money from stores damaged by 2005 hurricanes. Sears lost $13 million, or 8 cents, on investments in total-return swaps, agreements in which one investor makes payments based on any coupons and capital gains or losses of an asset and the other makes fixed or floating-rate payments. Sears sells exclusive brands including Kenmore home appliances and Craftsman tools. Earlier this month, the company began a new advertising campaign with the slogan, ``Sears, where it begins.&#39;&#39; At Kmart, it introduced Mr. Bluelight, an animated character who will highlight bargains and unique items for sale. Kmart was known for ``Blue Light Special&#39;&#39; sales in the 1970s and &#39;80s. Lampert said at the company&#39;s shareholder meeting earlier this month that Sears may add more exclusive brands, he said, a strategy that has helped J.C. Penney and Kohl&#39;s Corp. prosper. Gregory Melich, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in Purchase, N.Y., had forecast profit of $1.15 a share on sales of $11.8 billion. There&#39;s a ``newfound willingness on Chairman Eddie Lampert&#39;s part to spend money to improve the business,&#39;&#39; Melich wrote in a May 8 report. The company will need to invest more in stores and operations, he wrote.

The economy grew at a 0.6% annualized pace in the quarter, revised down from the initial estimate of 1.3%, the government said in its second estimate of quarterly gross domestic product. It was the slowest growth since late 2002. Read the full government report. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch were expecting GDP to be revised to 0.7%. The economy has grown just 1.9% in the past four quarters, well below the 3% growth most economists say is the long-run potential. It's the weakest year-over-year growth in four years. Consumers continued to lead the way in the first quarter with strong gains in spending and income, which were revised even higher than in the first estimate. The business sector, however, invested little and saw year-over-year before-tax profit growth fall to the lowest level of the five-year-old expansion. "The details of the report suggest some reasons for even more optimism for the second quarter," wrote Drew Matus, an economist for Lehman Bros. The faster businesses cut their inventories, the sooner they'll be ready to ramp up production again. Considering the large upward revision to consumer spending, the report "will widely be viewed as a positive when the details are scoured," wrote Tony Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist for Miller Tabak & Co. Although the drags from inventories and home building will lessen in coming quarters, consumer spending is weakening, he said. "The composition of GDP will turn unfavorable in the second quarter, putting into question the sustainability of a rebound in GDP," Crescenzi said. Data on consumer spending will be the main variable to watch. The revisions do little to change the broad picture of an American economy bolstered by the steady consumer, but weakened by a sickly housing market and a cautious business sector. In nominal terms (not adjusted for inflation), the economy grew 4.7% to $13.6 trillion annualized. Fed officials seem to be looking past the grim first-quarter growth data to a rebound later this year. In the minutes of the May 9 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee released on Wednesday, Fed officials unanimously voiced the view that inflation, not recession, remains the greater risk. Economy-wide inflation surged at the fastest pace in 16 years, and core consumer inflation accelerated a bit above the Federal Reserve's comfort zone. The GDP price index increased 4% annualized, the most since 1991. The core personal consumption price index increased at a 2.2% annual rate and is up 2.2% in the past year, above the 1% to 2% target zone for the Fed. The chances of any change this year in the Fed's interest rate target have evaporated in recent months. Recent signs point to reinvigorated capital spending. However, hopes for a quick rebound in housing have been dashed by further declines in key indicators. And consumer spending has started the second quarter on a weak note. In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefits fell 4,000 last week to 310,000, a sign that layoffs remain relatively rare. The government will report on May nonfarm payrolls on Friday, with economists expecting a gain of 150,000. Real consumer spending increased 4.4% annualized, the fastest in a year, compared with the 3.8% initial estimate. Spending on durable goods increased 8.8%, spending on nondurable goods rose 3.5% and spending on services increased 4%. With the 4.2% gain in the fourth quarter, it was the best back-to-back performance for consumer spending in four years, noted David Greenlaw, an economist for Morgan Stanley. Consumer spending contributed 3 percentage points to growth. Real disposable personal incomes increased at a 4.7% annual rate in the first quarter, boosted by a $50 billion disbursement of annual bonuses. Fourth-quarter income was revised higher by $33 billion from wages and salaries. Investments in houses dropped at a 15.4% annual pace, revised from 17% earlier. It's the sixth consecutive decline. Residential investments cut 1 percentage point from growth. Business fixed investments increased at a 2.9% annual pace, revised up from 2% earlier. Investments in equipment and software rose 2%, while investments in structures increased 5.1%. Business investments contributed 0.3 percentage points to growth. Inventories shrank by $4.5 billion. The change in inventory investment cut 1 percentage point from growth. Corporate profits before tax increased $20.3 billion, or 1.2%, to $1.67 trillion after falling $4.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Before-tax profits are up 6.3% in the past year, the weakest year-over-year growth since the fourth quarter of 2001. After-tax profits rose 1% in the first quarter and are up 6.4% in the past year. Nonfinancial corporate profits rose $16.2 billion, while financial corporate profits rose $4.8 billion. Exports fell 0.6%, the biggest decline in four years. Meanwhile, imports rose 5.7%. The trade deficit cut 1 percentage point from growth. Government spending rose 1% in the first quarter. Federal spending fell 3.9%, including a 7.3% drop in national defense spending. State and local government spending rose 3.9%. Government spending contributed 0.2 percentage points to growth. Rex Nutting is Washington bureau chief of MarketWatch.

Northwest Airlines Corp. exited bankruptcy on Thursday with creditors agreeing on a reorganization plan and the airline's flight attendants voting to accept a new labor agreement -- albeit barely, by just about 100 votes. The Eagan, Minn.-based carrier's new shares debuted Thursday, under the symbol NWA , and notched early gains of about 2% in New York Stock Exchange trading. The company's previous stock was delisted from Nasdaq in September 2005 after the carrier entered bankruptcy. The optimism that accompanied many of carriers' journeys through bankruptcy -- predicated on the shedding of debt and costly airplane leases and the freezing or jettisoning of pension obligations -- has helped the industry prepare better, though not fully, for the realities of mid-2007. Stubbornly high jet fuel prices, softening demand for travel and an excess of seats have hindered airline profit in recent quarters, renewing calls for mergers that would substantially trim available seat miles and associated costs. The new Northwest shares carried an initial price of $27 each, but like Delta shares earlier this year and United Airlines parent UAL Corp.'s post-Chapter 11 shares in early 2006, that price tag was too high. The trading marks the final return to solid footing for the last of the so-called legacy carriers that, starting with U.S. Airways in August 2002, began a long slide into bankruptcy. The trading marks the final return to solid footing for the last of the so-called legacy carriers that, starting with U.S. Airways in August 2002, began a long slide into bankruptcy. The airline's chief executive, Doug Steenland, said Northwest emerged from its 20 months in bankruptcy with more than $3 billion in cash and was looking forward to a "very strong" summer travel season. "It's a great day for the airline business," he said. Listen to the full interview. Northwest entered Chapter 11 in September 2005, as did rival Delta Air Lines Inc. the same day. Delta emerged earlier this year, and like Northwest, has shed labor costs and airplane leasing agreements. Northwest was able to reduce its costs by about $2.2 billion, including $1.4 billion in labor and pension expenses, and to shrink its aircraft fleet and reduce seating capacity by about 10%. "Northwest did not face as many problems to fix as did Delta upon entering bankruptcy because Northwest's non-labor costs were in fairly good shape, and their revenue generation was broadly comparable to their legacy airline peers," said Standard & Poor's airline analyst Philip Baggaley. But the carrier, despite its fresh-start accounting, is forecasting weak second-quarter demand, as the industry grapples with an oversupply of passenger seats and a softening U.S. economy. International route revenue remains strong, according to Northwest, which is the No. 1 U.S. carrier to Japan. Northwest in early April offered 27.8 million new shares as part of its exit from bankruptcy, with J.P. Morgan Securities acting as underwriter. General unsecured claimants received new stock worth between 66% and 83% of their allowed claims, the airline said in its federal filing. Delta's recently issued shares have slipped about 7% in their first month of trading -- a period during which the Amex Airline Index ( ) , composed of 11 airline stocks, gained about 6%. Delta's shares aren't part of the Amex benchmark. "For the first since 2002 there are no major airlines in bankruptcy. It seems weird," said Baggaley. "The industry situation has certainly improved -- there's a better balance of supply and demand. But fuel prices are higher now than they were at the start of that period, and the big airlines still are carrying a lot of debt and other financial obligations."

Explain to interested patients that there are few treatments for advanced renal cell carcinoma and they are of limited efficacy and considerable toxicity, especially in cases where the tumor burden is extensive. Note that this study found that a new drug, temsirolimus, prolongs survival and is better tolerated than a standard treatment, interferon alfa, in patients with metastatic disease. And in a rare confluence of research results and regulatory action, on the same day that the pivotal randomized trial was published in the New England Journal of Medicine the drug was approved by the FDA for the indication. For patients getting the drug, median survival was 3.6 months longer than for those getting standard treatment with interferon alfa, Gary Hudes, M.D., of the Fox Chase Cancer Center, and colleagues in the Global ARCC Trial, reported in the May 31 issue of the A third arm of the industry-sponsored study, combining temsirolimus and interferon alfa, did not show any survival benefit over interferon alfa alone, Dr. Hudes and colleagues found. "This is the first study to show that a new drug can improve overall survival for patients with metastatic renal cell cancer," Dr. Hudes said. Early last year, sutinib (Sutent) was approved to treat metastatic renal cell carcinoma, but the studies involving that drug showed improvement in progression-free survival, rather than overall survival. Similarly, sorafenib (Nexavar) was approved in December 2005 on the basis of a delay in disease progression in renal cell carcinoma. While the survival improvement with temsirolimus therapy is "modest," Dr. Hudes said, patients in the study had very advanced tumors. "It would be reasonable to hypothesize that temsirolimus could provide greater benefit to patients with less extensive metastatic disease," Dr. Hudes said. The current study was stopped at the second interim analysis, the researchers said, when 446 of the 626 patients had died and there was significant evidence (at In the study, patients were randomized to 25 mg of temsirolimus intravenously once a week; to interferon alfa, at a dose escalating from three million to 18 million units, subcutaneously three times a week; or to a combination of 15 mg of temsirolimus weekly and six million units of interferon alfa three times a week. Median survival for patients getting temsirolimus was 10.9 months, compared with 7.3 months for interferon alfa and 8.4 months for the combination. For temsirolimus patients, the hazard ratio for death, compared to interferon alfa, was 0.73 (with a 95% confidence interval from 0.58 to 0.92), which was significant at Overall survival for patients in the combination group did not differ significantly from those getting interferon alfa. Dr. Hudes and colleagues said the lack of efficacy in the combination group may have been a result of the lower dose of temsirolimus. The study also showed a significantly longer period of progression-free survival ( Temsirolimus was better tolerated than interferon-alfa, with 67% of patients in the temsirolimus group having Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, compared with 78% of interferon patients and 87% of patients in the combination group. Both differences were significant at The study was supported by Wyeth Research, which is developing temsirolimus. Dr. Hudes reported financial links to Pfizer Pharmaceuticals and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. Other authors reported financial links to industrial concerns including Wyeth, Novartis, Chiron, Bayer, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, and Genentech. Three of the authors, Timothy O'Toole, Stephanie Lustgarten, and Laurence Moore, M.D., Ph.D., are full-time employees of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals.

(AP) -- A bomb scare at a Massachusetts bank branch proved to be a false alarm after an internal fax transmission about a Bank of America promotion was misinterpreted as a threat. The bank branch's manager called police shortly after 10:00 A.M. The State Police bomb squad was sent and authorities evacuated nearly a dozen businesses in the shopping plaza, including a day care center. The evacuation was lifted after it was learned the fax had been sent by a marketing group for a promotion to kick off a special offer from the bank. A Bank of American spokesman says the fax contained images of a lighted match and a bomb with a fuse. A page with text explaining the promotion failed to come through because of a transmission error. Fears also arose in part because the transmission came in just as a suspicious package was delivered to the branch. It's not the first time a marketing ploy has touched off a bomb scare in the Boston area. Bomb squads were sent out in January to check out blinking devices that had been placed as a promotion for a Cartoon Network program. (Copyright 2007 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)

Assistant U.S. attorney Eric Sussman offered no explanation for why he asked Judge Amy St. Eve for approval to drop the money-laundering charge, which was added to the indictment in December, 2005. Lord Black was the only one among four co-defendants who was facing the charge. Edward Genson, a defence attorney representing Lord Black, quipped, "OK, I guess I can go" as the charge was dropped. The 16- member jury was not present and attorneys in the case were discussing issues related to the trial, including upcoming evidence. Evan Agostini, Getty Images Email to a friend The decision provided a bright spot for the defence before the jury arrived and prosecutors introduced into evidence a stack of documents found inside the 13 boxes that Lord Black was videotaped removing from Hollinger Inc.'s office in Toronto. The boxes included receipts for purchases Lord Black had made at a number of luxury stores, among them more than US$116,000 at Yves St. Laurent, US$101,550 at Fendi and US$2.62-million at Graff Diamonds Limited. Prosecutor Jeffrey Cramer also flashed bank statements showing a deposit made to Lord Black for US$4.3-million from American Publishing Company on April 9, 2001. Mr. Cramer also displayed travel documents from Tekura Tahiti Travel related to Lord Black's trip to Bora Bora. An original copy of a contract signed by Lord Black was also shown to the jury. The contents of the battered office boxes, which have been sitting in front of the jurors on a trolley in the courtroom for days, had largely remained a mystery to them until yesterday. The jury also saw an e-mail that Lord Black sent to co-defendant Peter Atkinson on Jan. 17, 2003, referring to a public company as a "vehicle for extracting money, as in the non-competes." After presenting the jury with the flurry of documents, Mr. Sussman announced, "At this time, the prosecution rests." After jurors filed out of the courtroom, Lord Black and his wife, Barbara Amiel, left the room holding hands. The press baron had a faint smile on his lips. The U.S. government alleges Lord Black and other senior Hollinger International executives misappropriated US$60-million in bonuses disguised as non-compete payments from Hollinger International during the sale of newspaper assets. Lord Black is facing an additional charge of obstruction of justice, which is directly linked to the removal of the boxes. After the jurors had left for the day, Marc Martin, a defence lawyer for Lord Black, yesterday applied to Judge St. Eve to have all of the charges against the press baron dismissed. He took particular exception with the obstruction of justice charge, arguing that were it not for an Ontario court order that prevented the removal of documents from Hollinger Inc. in May 2005, the charge would have no basis. "We don't know what Mr. Black's intention was," Mr. Martin argued, pointing out that the press baron had been ordered to vacate the office by the end of the month. John Mayer acts out a bizarre ...

Farzad Nazem's plans to leave the Sunnyvale-based company were disclosed Wednesday in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing and a posting on Yahoo's Web site. The resignation becomes effective June 8, just six months after Yahoo named Nazem head of the company's newly created technology group as part of a management shake up. He had already been Yahoo's chief technology officer since April 1998, two years after he first joined the company as senior vice president of product development. While Yahoo searches for Nazem's replacement, company co-founder Jerry Yang will oversee the technology group as interim "executive sponsor." Fellow co-founder David Filo also will continue his focus on technology, the company said in statement. In the posting on Yahoo's Web site, Nazem, 45, said he simply wants to retire. "After spending the last 26 years in this fast-paced technology industry, I've finally decided it's time to slow down," wrote Nazem, who also worked at business software maker Oracle Corp. before joining Yahoo. Nazem's departure comes at a pivotal time for Yahoo. After suffering an 11 percent drop in its first-quarter profit, Yahoo is banking on long-awaited improvements to its advertising platform to boost its fortunes during the second half of this year. In the Web posting, Nazem said he delayed his retirement until the new advertising formula - known as the "Panama" project - was completed and he felt confident that his mission had been accomplished. "With all this in place now, I know I'm leaving a strong, dedicated, and focused organization that is ready to define the next wave of the Internet revolution," Nazem wrote. Yahoo parted ways with another of its top executives, former Chief Operating Officer Dan Rosensweig, at the end of March. Rosensweig left as part of the management shake up announced in early December. Yahoo is still looking for a new executive to oversee the "audience" group that was formed as part of that reorganization. Nazem will walk away from Yahoo as a wealthy man, having made millions by exercising the stock options that he accumulated during his tenure. In the last four years alone, Nazem has realized $213 million in gains by exercising some of his stock options, according to SEC filings. Under his separation agreement, Nazem will retain the rights to another 2.97 million stock options with exercise prices ranging between $20.58 and $34.75 per share as long he adheres to certain restrictions, including a three-year prohibition against taking a job with Yahoo rivals Google Inc. or Microsoft Corp. Yahoo also will pay Nazem the balance of his $500,000 salary and accelerate the vesting rights of his restricted stock in the company, according to SEC documents. Most of Nazem's stock options are currently worthless because Yahoo's market value has sagged since the end of 2005. Yahoo shares dipped 2 cents to finish Wednesday's regular trading at $28.38, then shed another 18 cents in extending trading after the disclosure of Nazem's resignation.

( CHICAGO (Reuters) - Northwest Airlines is set to exit bankruptcy on Thursday, marking the end of a 20-month spell in Chapter 11 for the No. 5 U.S. carrier, and the first time in almost five years that a major U.S. airline has not been in bankruptcy. Northwest has spent the last year and a half hacking $2.4 billion off its annual costs, mostly from an aggrieved work force. Like other so-called "legacy' airlines, it has been forced to drastically slash its costs to keep pace with newer low-cost carriers and deal with wild spikes in fuel costs. The company will officially relaunch as a slimmed-down carrier when Chief Executive Doug Steenland rings the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Its shares will trade on the Big Board, marking the first time Northwest stock has changed hands on a major public exchange since it was delisted from Nasdaq in September 2005. Northwest's emergence from bankruptcy protection appears to signal the end of a five-year period of extreme turbulence for U.S airlines, as it and its rivals have made huge strides toward ensuring their long-term survival. But despite major cost cuts, Northwest faces intense competition, soaring fuel prices and furious employees who resent forfeiting $1.4 billion annually only to see their bosses net enormous payouts from stock and options awards. Employee rage swelled this month when the company revealed a management compensation plan that awards Steenland stock and options potentially worth more than $20 million. "Northwest may be emerging from Chapter 11, but it has a long way to go," said Anthony Sabino, a law professor at St. John's University in New York. "Much of the carrier's unionized work force is tremendously unhappy. And in an intensely competitive and service-oriented industry such as the airlines, the bad blood could cost Northwest dearly, if not doom it altogether," he said. SURVIVING IN A TROUBLED INDUSTRY Northwest, which has cut its debt and leasing obligations by $4.2 billion, is not facing these challenges alone. Three of the big U.S. carriers --- Northwest, Delta Air Lines and UAL Corp's United Airlines -- have all been in Chapter 11 in the last five years. US Airways Group also went bankrupt and was saved from liquidation only by a merger with America West Airlines. AMR Corps. American Airlines restructured without entering bankruptcy. Without exception these airlines grappled with peeved workers, low-fare competition and soaring fuel prices. The industry mounted a recovery in 2006 thanks to a string of revenue-boosting fare rises, but several failed fare increases in 2007 suggest rising fares are at an end. Meanwhile, domestic competition is increasingly vigorous thanks to new entrants such as Virgin America Airlines and Skybus Airlines Inc. Consequently, top airlines have warned of excess domestic capacity, which could erode pricing power. In a government filing on Tuesday, Northwest predicted softening domestic revenue in 2007 due to industry supply increases and a slowing economy. "I think they are very sensitive to the tenuous state of domestic demand," said Velocity Group airline consultant Doug Abbey. He said, however, that Northwest is better positioned than most airlines to support higher fares because of its dominance at its hubs in Detroit and Minneapolis. "They really dominate those airports with relatively little low-cost competition," Abbey said. "They're in a strong position to maintain higher yields." Some airlines have reacted by moving capacity to lucrative international routes where they face less competition. Northwest also has tweaked its domestic operations by acquiring its regional partner Mesaba Airlines. It also has launched a regional subsidiary called Compass Airlines. Some, such as US Airways CEO Doug Parker, have said airline mergers are the key to long-term survival as they alleviate excess capacity. Early this year, talk of potential industry consolidation was rampant. Speculation died down in recent months, although some still believe consolidation is in the cards -- perhaps even a Northwest-Delta merger. In January, Delta beat back a hostile takeover bid from US Airways, which in 2005 merged with America West Airlines. "I'm just presuming, absent any crisis, airlines will do moderately well over the next six months, and then if things go south ... then I think we'd see consolidation rear its ugly head again," Abbey said.

The move comes after the company had previously announced it would slash 3,500 posts by June 30. The move comes after the company had previously announced it would slash 3,500 posts by June 30 Motorola, which has been losing market share to rivals such as Nokia due to a lack of advanced phones and tough price competition, had said in April that it would announce additional cost-cutting plans by June. The latest planned cuts at the company, which had 66,000 employees at the end of 2006, will be made by the end of the year. The company forecasts the combined job losses and other cost-cutting moves will save the firm $600 million (&pound;304m) a year. Mobile phone analyst Lawrence Harris said Motorola would need better phone models to impress investors. He added: "It will certainly help them return to profitability but it&#39;s not enough to get them to the double digit profit margins they seek. They need exciting new products."

Rex Tillerson, Exxon's chief executive officer, told reporters at the company's annual meeting in Dallas yesterday that the $16.2-billion price tag for the 1,200-kilometre natural gas pipeline means that it is not viable without sizable federal aid. &#34;We are now in a situation where it's not economic at current costs,&#34; Mr. Tillerson said, noting the tremendous inflation that has plagued oil field construction projects. He said it is not clear if the federal government will come forward with a package of royalty and tax breaks large enough to provide the project sponsors with a decent rate of return. Print Edition - Section Front More Report on Business Stories The last of the wildcatters Thick-skinned iconoclast packs it in Workplace guidelines needed for 'mobile snacking' Exxon warns it will shelve Mackenzie pipe without subsidy Lots of hype, but a slow road for Web TV Go to the Report on Business section &#34;It may just be that the project is going to have to wait for a different cost environment,&#34; he said. The pipeline would carry up to 1.9 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from the Canadian Arctic to Alberta, and is seen as a critical piece of infrastructure in opening the North to resource development. Exxon owns 69.6 per cent of of Calgary, which is leading the project, currently under review by the National Energy Board. Earlier this year, Imperial announced that the projected cost for the Mackenzie Valley pipeline had ballooned to $16.2-billion from $7.5-billion, and that the partners would require &#34;an appropriate fiscal framework&#34; from the government to allow it to go ahead. Since then, the company and the federal government have been in discussions, although industry insiders believe Imperial is asking far more than Ottawa is prepared to give. Imperial spokesman Pius Rolheiser said yesterday that the company remains committed to the pipeline construction and continues to negotiate with northern native groups and the government as it pursues regulatory approval. &#34;Yes, it's economically challenged, yes we're concerned about its competitiveness, and to that end, we continue to work with the federal government on a fiscal framework that makes sense for the project, which we see as key to improving its competitiveness,&#34; he said. But Mr. Rolheiser would not repeat Mr. Tillerson's assertion that the project is &#34;uneconomic,&#34; retreating to the more vague description, &#34;economically challenged.&#34; Nor would he comment on Mr. Tillerson's suggestion that the project might be shelved. Bill Rodgers, a spokesman for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, Jim Prentice, said the minister was unaware of Mr. Tillerson's comments, but that the government has had no indication Imperial is ready to walk away from the project or put it on the shelf. &#34;Nothing has changed as far as we can tell,&#34; he said. UBS Securities analyst Andrew Potter said it has been clear for some time that Imperial was unwilling to move forward with the project unless it gets generous tax and royalty breaks from Ottawa. Mr. Potter said he believes the pipeline project could yield an 8-per-cent rate of return at current natural gas prices on spot markets, but noted that Exxon and Imperial are notoriously cautious about using conservative price estimates for project planning. &#34;Uneconomic means different things to different people,&#34; he said. The analyst added that the federal government is hesitant to be seen as providing subsidies to the world's most profitable oil company but, at the same time, is eager to see the project proceed because it would open the North to further natural gas development. &#34;It's a strategic project for the nation; it's a strategic project for North American gas supply,&#34; he said.

Net income rose to $216 million, or $1.40 a share, in the first quarter ended on May 5, from $180 million, or $1.14 a share, a year earlier. In early May, Sears said it expected net income of $1.30 to $1.53 a share. Sears Holdings Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer talks at the NASDAQ market site in New York as Sears Holdings Corporation (SHLD) is listed for the first time, March 28, 2005. Retailer Sears Holdings Corp. posted a 20 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by a legal settlement and other special gains, but sales declined at both its Sears and Kmart units. REUTERS/Jeff Christensen Email to a friend Excluding special items, earnings fell to $1.10 per share from $1.11. Analysts on average were expecting $1.22, according to Reuters Estimates. "In part, our domestic operating results reflect the impact of some of the same challenges being faced by our customers, such as rising energy costs and a slower housing market," Chief Executive Aylwin Lewis said in a release. "However, as an organization, we need to overcome these factors by better controlling costs and developing innovative solutions that better meet our customers' needs." Sales fell 2.5 percent to $11.7 billion, and U.S. comparable-store sales were down 3.9 percent. By brand, comparable-store sales, also known as comps, declined 3.4 percent at Sears and fell 4.4 percent at Kmart. The results came in at the lower end of the forecast the company provided on May 3, Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said in a note to clients. "Surprisingly, comps at Sears were a full point lower, at -3.4 percent, than they projected with two days to go in the quarter," he said. "Must have been a tough last weekend (or may reflect the apples to apples comps they reported which they may not have used in their preliminary report)." The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based company's cash balance came to $3.4 billion. Investors watch Sears' cash position closely because the company has given Chairman Edward Lampert authority to invest excess money as he sees fit. The latest results include gains from a legal settlement, benefit plans at Sears Canada , a dividend from Sears Mexico and hurricane-related recoveries. Sears shares were down $4.09, or 2.2 percent, at $179.16 in morning Nasdaq trade. At Wednesday's close, the stock had risen about 9 percent this year and traded in a 52-week range of $195.18 to $134.56. John Mayer acts out a bizarre ...

Aun Part of the ECT News Network 05/30/07 11:24 AM PT Rupert Murdoch's Fox Interactive Media has purchased the photo-sharing site Photobucket as well as Web tool provider Flektor. The purchase price was undisclosed; however, it is rumored to be in the neighborhood of $250 million. The deal comes just weeks after a high-profile tiff between Photobucket and Murdoch's MySpace social networking site. Complete Control Over Your Site A HostMySite VPS is the right solution when you need more control over your hosting. With root access, you can install applications and customize your own secure VPS environment, all at a much lower cost than a dedicated server. Rupert Murdoch, who lost a chance to buy last year when the massive video-hosting site was gobbled up by , has snagged two other Internet companies that are popular with young people: Murdoch's Fox Interactive Media (FIM), which owns the heavily visited social networking hub , announced the acquisition Wednesday. Photobucket is a photo- and video-sharing site used by many MySpace members. Flektor provides Web-based tools for photo and video editing and mashups. Terms of the deals were not revealed, but Reuters recently reported the Photobucket acquisition would cost Murdoch about US$250 million. The purchase comes close on the heels of a public dispute between Photobucket and MySpace during which MySpace blocked its users from accessing to Photobucket. Photobucket, based in Denver, says it has about 42 million users. That makes it the world's largest photo-sharing Web site. Its huge success, despite being online for only about four years, is the result of its affiliation with Web 2.0 social networking sites, including MySpace, that feed on users' desires for self-expression and interaction. Photobucket "is expected to remain in operation as a stand-alone site" but its technology and tools will be shared with other FIM sites "as well as the more than 300,000 other Web sites linked to by Photobucket's users," FIM said. The purchase of Photobucket and Flektor "is a perfect strategic fit" for his company, FIM President Peter Levinsohn said. "As a leading site for creative expression, Photobucket extends our reach among personal media sharing enthusiasts, and the innovative new entrant Flektor brings highly-differentiated new tools to the table that will drive the next generation," said Levinsohn. That sweet-talk marks quite a turnaround from the animosity expressed just last month by representatives of MySpace and Photobucket. MySpace, contending Photobucket violated MySpace's terms of service by sticking advertisements inside image files, blocked its users from posting Photobucket-stored slide shows and videos. In response, Photobucket told its customers MySpace was "showing that it considers you as a commodity which it can treat as it sees fit." Negotiations ensued and two weeks later, Photobucket announced it had "established open lines of communication and procedures with MySpace to prevent a sudden block of Photobucket content in the future." Although Murdoch had his eyes on YouTube, Google beat him to the punch by paying $1.65 billion for the site last October. All the wheeling and dealing reveals several trends are afoot, according to Jupiter Research analyst Barry Parr. "We've been saying for a while now that social networking services are turning into portals," he told TechNewsWorld. "I think this is piece of what we are seeing here. Clearly, MySpace knows it's in a position to drive traffic to sites and it is completely reasonable to expect them to integrate vertically and drive that traffic to sites it owns." The acquisition may not indicate a trend, but it does make good business sense, said "MySpace's interest in Photobucket is less a general trend than it is a decent fit between what MySpace does -- gathering people -- and what Photobucket adds, namely, helping those people share pictures," he told TechNewsWorld. "Because Photobucket also brings in a few dozen million people that MySpace doesn't already have, it's even more valuable. Seems like a good but unique fit more than a harbinger of things to come." Big fish eating smaller fish is otherwise known as consolidation, and it happens as industries age, explained Parr. "The Web is definitely maturing," he said. "The number of users is growing more slowly and it is going to flatten out in the next five years. One of the things that happens in maturing markets is consolidation. We expect there to be more." Additionally, the FIM/Photobucket deal shows that -- despite their popularity -- interactive sites such as Photobucket are worth more to entities like Fox than they are as stand-alone companies, said Parr. "There is one thing MySpace and Fox have to be careful about," he suggested. "They have to continue to be open. In the long run, if they are not open and don't allow other sites to, say, provide widgets to customers, they might find that over time, their customers will migrate to other more open sites." Another issue the media moguls must face is monetization, McQuivey said. "Overall the message is that social computing is a powerful platform as long as it has a way to put advertisements in front of those people being gathered -- which YouTube still lacks, even this far post acquisition," he noted. "That's why the purchase prices have rationalized -- buyers are properly focused on valuing the people coming to the site more than the intangible value of the collective community."

Faulty fax, mistaken as threat, prompts evacuation of stores By John C. Drake, Globe Staff | ASHLAND -- In a scene reminiscent of the Cartoon Network bomb scare that paralyzed the Boston area in January, police shut down a strip mall yesterday in this small western suburb after employees at a branch mistook a botched fax for a bomb threat. Frustrated shop owners said the branch overreacted to the strange fax, which turned out to be an in-house marketing document sent by the bank's corporate office. "The women at the bank should have handled it a little better," said Nick Markos, owner of Townhouse Pizza and Roast Beef, who estimated that he had lost $1,000 to $1,200 because of the lunch-hour evacuation. "She blew it all out of proportion, and all of us business owners had to pay for it." A day-care center with about 30 children and more than a dozen small businesses in Ledgemere Plaza on Eliot Street were evacuated for about three hours after bank branch managers received a fax with images of a crude timer and a hand lighting a bomb, Ashland police Chief Scott Rohmer said. Bank employees told police a suspicious package had arrived around the same time, elevating their fears. Bank security personnel later determined that a fax machine at the corporate office left off the text alerting employees to Small Business Commitment Week in June, including the words, "The Countdown Begins," above the bomb. "It was not a communication that was ever meant to be distributed to customers or anyone externally, and the fax machine malfunctioned, so when it came out of the fax machine, it looked suspicious," Bank of America spokesman Ernesto Anguilla said. Anguilla said that branches across the Northeast received the distorted fax and that while other branches also evacuated, none saw law enforcement response as extensive as in Ashland. He would not say how many branches received the fax or how many had been evacuated. "In Ashland, the situation was compounded by the fact that we had a suspicious package on the scene, as well," Anguilla said. Added Rohmer, "I think it was reasonable to assume there was a threat, based on what they saw on the fax." Rohmer said that town officials may ask Bank of America to reimburse the town for the cost of the response, which included more than a dozen town officers and firefighters, personnel from neighboring towns, a State Police bomb squad, and police dogs. Anguilla would not comment on whether the bank would be willing to pay for the emergency response. A reimbursement would add to the similarities to the Cartoon Network scare in January. The guerrilla marketing campaign, in which two artists hung 40 battery-powered light screens around Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville, shut down major streets and subways as bomb squads rushed to remove the suspicious-looking devices. Turner Broadcasting System, Cartoon Network's parent company, reimbursed local, state, and federal agencies and governments $1 million for the cost of the response and paid an additional $1 million in goodwill cash. Dawn Frazier, a Holliston resident and owner of the Paul Albert Salon and Spa in the shopping plaza, said she immediately thought of that scare when she learned why she had to evacuate her busy shop. "It was very disruptive," she said. Cristina Valas, owner of The Family Pet Hospital, said it was fortunate that the hospital was not in the middle of a surgery when police ordered the evacuation. They were directed to leave three cats, including one recovering from dental surgery, inside. "I wouldn't have taken it as a bomb threat, personally," said veterinary technician Amy Tatreau.

The $75 million (&#8364;56 million) cash acquisition gives eBay access to about 2.3 million people who have filled out profiles at StumbleUpon, founded in 2001 by three Canadian software engineers in Calgary. The venture capital-funded company, which recently relocated to San Francisco, is considered a pioneer of the so-called "Web 3.0" niche. The term refers to technology that pairs general Internet search capability with a user&#039;s personal data and aggregated community data, theoretically delivering more relevant results than a standard search engine such as Google Inc. For example, a StumbleUpon search for "cars" could generate a list of Web pages that factor in a user&#039;s income, age, gender, home address, current vehicles owned and other demographic data submitted. The search results would also include sites ranked favorably by other StumbleUpon members with similar interests and background. By contrast, a straight Google search delivers 357 million Web pages ranging from the popular Hollywood movie "Cars" to advertisements for used car dealers and newspaper classified sections. US economy grows by just 0.6 percent in the first quarter Wachovia buys A.G. Edwards for $6.8 billion . Deutsche Telekom executive who once worked at Siemens to leave company StumbleUpon is free for users and generates revenue through advertising, though the company doesn&#039;t disclose financial information. Members who pay an annual fee bypass advertisements completely. Michael Buhr, senior director at San Jose-based eBay, will serve as general manager of StumbleUpon. StumbleUpons founders and managers will become eBay employees. "StumbleUpon is a great fit within our goal of pioneering new communities based on commerce and sustained by trust," Buhr said. The acquisition is not expected to change eBay&#039;s latest financial guidance. The company expects to report second-quarter profit of 31 cents to 33 cents per share on sales in the range of $1.75 billion (&#8364;1.3 billion) to $1.8 billion (&#8364;1.34 billion). For the full year, eBay expects profit of $1.30 (&#8364;.97) to $1.34 (&#8364;1) per share on sales of $7.2 billion (&#8364;5.37 billion) to $7.45 billion (&#8364;5.55 billion). The 12-year-old e-commerce powerhouse had $3.5 billion (&#8364;2.6 billion) in cash last month and has been aggressively acquiring smaller companies to compete against rivals ranging from Google to Amazon.com. EBay, which already owns Internet phone service Skype and portals such as Shopping.com and Rent.com, completed the buyout of online ticket reseller StubHub for $310 million (&#8364;231 million) earlier this year.

The bank and the entire strip mall on Elliot Street, which includes a day-care center, was evacuated at about 11 a.m. All of the children were taken to Warren Elementary School to meet their parents. The businesses were reopened after officials found out that the fax was sent by a marketing group for a promotion to kick off a special offer from the bank. "Fortunately, the incident was a false alarm. A document, which was an internal communication sent from a malfunctioning fax machine, combined with a suspicious package brought into the Ashland banking center, caused some concern," Bank of America said in a statement. The bank said that the fax was meant for Bank of America employees and was intended for internal purposes for an upcoming small business promotion. Copyright 2007 by TheBostonChannel.com.

The move, along with lower general and administrative expenses, will help save an additional $600 million a year starting in 2008, Motorola said today in a statement. The company said it expects costs of $300 million, or 8 cents a share, in the remainder of this year tied to the latest cuts. The reductions represent about 6 percent of Motorola&#39;s total workforce at the end of 2006, and come on top of 3,500 job cuts announced in January. Schaumburg, Illinois-based Motorola posted its first loss in almost three years in the first quarter as competitors Nokia Oyj and Samsung Electronics Co. won market share with new devices. ``They&#39;re doing the right things,&#39;&#39; said William Choi, a Jefferies & Co. analyst in New York who rates the shares ``hold&#39;&#39; and doesn&#39;t own them. ``It doesn&#39;t solve the main problem they currently have, which is to strengthen their portfolio of handset products.&#39;&#39; Shares of Motorola rose 17 cents to $18.45 in extended trading. They slipped 2 cents to $18.28 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading and have lost 11 percent this year. Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland, has gained 30 percent, and Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung has declined 13 percent. Chief Executive Officer Ed Zander has come under fire from investors for not moving quickly enough to revive the mobile- phone business. He is rolling out new products and focusing on profit, instead of chopping prices to win back market share. ``Long-term, sustainable profitability is -- and always has been -- Motorola&#39;s top priority,&#39;&#39; Chief Financial Officer Tom Meredith said in the statement. Motorola said the January firings, which mainly affected middle managers, will be completed on schedule by June 30. The company, which had 66,000 workers at the end of 2006, plans to save $400 million a year with the original cuts. The company said separately a count of shareholder votes confirmed that billionaire investor Carl Icahn failed to win a seat on the board. Icahn, who criticized management, won 717.1 million votes, compared with 931.7 million for John White, who has been on Motorola&#39;s board since 1995. A non-binding proposal to give shareholders a vote on executive pay, which the board had opposed, won 51.8 percent of votes, Motorola said. The company&#39;s profit margins shrank last year amid price- cutting to make up for a lack of successful products to replace its best-selling Razr phone, which is more than two years old. The loss at the handset unit was $231 million excluding some costs last quarter. Revenue from phones fell 15 percent to $5.4 billion as sales slipped in emerging markets and in Europe. In the first quarter, Zander stopped lowering prices to preserve profit. The strategy backfired as Motorola lost sales, partly because its phones weren&#39;t competitive, according to Boston-based researcher Strategy Analytics Ltd. The company on May 15 said it will start selling a successor to the Razr in July in a bid to fuel demand. While the Razr2 and other products unveiled this quarter will help Motorola return to profit, they aren&#39;t enough to stem further market share losses in the second half of the year, according to analysts including Piper Jaffray & Co.&#39;s T. Michael Walkley. The market share gap between Nokia and Motorola widened to its largest in more than three years in the first quarter, Strategy Analytics said. Motorola&#39;s market share slid to 18 percent, while Nokia&#39;s share widened to 36.2 percent. Nokia on May 14 said its market share will increase in the second quarter.

May 30 2007: 7:19 PM EDT NEW YORK (Reuters) -- Federal prosecutors Wednesday charged two current and two former partners of accounting firm Ernst & Young with tax fraud conspiracy arising out of the sale of tax shelters. The defendants, who pleaded not guilty at U.S. District court in Manhattan, are accused of creating and marketing tax shelters at the "Big Four" accounting firm from 1998 through 2004 based on fraudulent scenarios that allowed wealthy individuals to reduce the federal taxes they would have to pay. Despite 'reform,' tax dollars are still spent on secret earmarks even Congress members can't find. CNN's Drew Griffin reports. (May 25) The indictment comes after years of investigations into the sale of aggressive tax shelter strategies. Sixteen former partners at rival "Big Four" firm KPMG are also facing trial in September. GM gets SEC accounting info request The four men accused Wednesday include Robert Coplan, former National Director of Ernst & Young's Center for Family Wealth Planning; Martin Nissenbaum, the firm's former national director of Personal Income Tax and Retirement Planning; former Ernst & Young partner Richard Shapiro and Brian Vaughn, a former senior manager at the firm. A lawyer for Shapiro, John Tigue, said his client has cooperated with the government's inquiry for the last five years. "He intends to vigorously defend himself," Tigue said in a statement. At a hearing before U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein, Copland, Shapiro and Nissenbaum were released on $1 million bail with travel restrictions, while Vaughn was released on $300,000 bail with travel restrictions. If convicted of the charges, Coplan, 54, could face 18 years in prison; Nissenbaum, 51, could serve as many as 13 years, while Shapiro, 58, and Vaughn, 39, could each face 10. Defense lawyers maintained their clients were innocent. "We have provided them (the U.S. attorney's office) over the past year with evidence that Mr. Nissenbaum did not engage in any unlawful activity," Brian Linder, an attorney for Nissenbaum said in a statement. Vaughn's attorney, Peter Barrett, said his client "looks forward to trial in this case, to his acquittal, and complete exoneration of all of these allegations." A lawyer for Coplan would not comment. Prosecutors allege the four schemed to defraud U.S. tax authorities by deceiving the the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about tax shelters marketed to clients with incomes higher than $10 million or $20 million. The indictment also charges that Coplan, Nissenbaum and Shapiro used tax shelters in 2000 to evade their own taxes and arranged for eight other Ernst & Young partners to participate, evading $3.7 million in taxes. Ernst & Young was not named in the suit, suggesting a change in government strategy since the conviction of now-defunct accounting firm Arthur Andersen was overturned by the Supreme Court, a legal expert said. "The lesson the government has learned is to go for a precision strike against individuals," said Anthony Sabino, a law professor at St. John's University's Tobin College of Business. "You can't prove the whole firm is guilty." The attempted prosecution of the firm also lengthened the KPMG tax shelter case, Sabino said. In 2005, KPMG agreed to pay $456 million, accept an outside monitor and admit to wrongdoing to resolve a federal investigation into questionable tax shelters it sold to wealthy individuals. But the settlement with the firm resulted in difficulties about who would pay the legal fees of KPMG's former partners in that case. Ernst & Young said it has made changes to its tax practice. "The individuals who were indicted are two former partners and two partners who have been on administrative leave," Ernst & Young spokesman Charles Perkins said in a statement. "They were part of a small group within the firm, disbanded years ago ... Ernst & Young has cooperated with the government from the beginning of its investigation, and we will continue to do so." In July 2003, Ernst & Young agreed to pay $15 million to the IRS to end an investigation of tax shelter marketing.

According to the indictment unsealed Wednesday, the defendants and their co-conspirators concocted and marketed tax shelter transactions based on false and fraudulent factual scenarios to be used by wealthy individuals with taxable income generally in excess of $10 or $20 million to eliminate or reduce the taxes they would have to pay the IRS. The indictment charges four individuals in 8 separate counts, including conspiracy to defraud the IRS, tax evasion, making false statements to the IRS, and impeding and impairing the lawful functioning of the IRS. All four individuals worked in a group set up by E&#038;Y in 1998 to develop tax shelters, which was first named VIPER (Value Ideas Produce ExtraordinaryResults), and later renamed SISG (Strategic Individual SolutionsGroup) The four individuals named in the indictment are: Robert Coplan, 54, of Plano, Texas, a former E&#038;Y tax partner who was the leader of the VIPER/SISG group, and the former national director of E&#038;Yâ€™s Center for Wealth Planning. Â Coplan, a lawyer, was at one time a branch chief in the IRSâ€™ Legislation and Regulations Division. Martin Nissenbaum, 51, of Brooklyn, Â an E&#038;Y partner who was a member of the VIPER/SISG group, and the national director of E&#038;Y&#8217;s Personal Income Tax and Retirement Planning practice. NIssenbaum is also a lawyer. Richard Shapiro, 58, of Rye Brook, Â who was a member of the VIPER/SISG group, and an E&#038;Y tax partner. Shapiro is also a lawyer. Brian Vaughn, 39, of Calhoun, Louisiana a former member of the VIPER/SISG group, and a former E&#038;Y tax partner, who is a CPA. As alleged in the indictment, from 1998 through 2004, the four defendants and others participated in a scheme to defraud the IRS by designing, marketing, implementing and defending fraudulent tax shelters. The conspirators sought to deceive the IRS about the bona fides of those shelters and the circumstances under which the shelters were marketed and sold to clients, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors say the defendants and their co-conspirators understood that if the IRS were to detect their clients&#8217; use of these tax shelters, and learn the true facts and circumstances surrounding the design, marketing and implementation of the shelters, the IRS would aggressively challenge the claimed tax benefits. In tha tevent, the IRS would seek to collect the unpaid taxes plus interest, and might also seek to impose substantial penalties upon the clients. Accordingly, the conspirators undertook to prevent the IRS from detecting their clients&#8217; use of these shelters; understanding how the transactions operated to produce the tax results reported by the clients; learning that the shelters were marketed as cookie-cutter products that would eliminate, reduce or defer large tax liabilities; learning that the clients were not seeking profit-making investment opportunities, but were instead seeking huge tax benefits; and learning that, from the outset, all the clients intended to complete a pre-planned series of steps that had been designed by the conspirators to lead to the specific tax benefits sought by the clients. In order to maximize the appearance that the tax shelters were investments undertaken to generate profits, and to minimize the likelihood that the IRS would learn the transactions were actually designed to create tax losses and deductions, the defendants and their co-conspirators allegedly created and in creating transactional documents and other materials containing false and fraudulent descriptions of the clients&#8217; motivations for entering into the transactions, and their motivations for taking the various steps that would yield the tax benefits. The conspirators also carefully protected internal documents and promotional materials that set forth the tax benefits and pricing schedules of the various shelters against disclosure to the IRS. Prosecutors say that in order to encourage clients to participate in the shelters, and to shield the clients from substantial penalties that could be imposed if the IRS disallowed the claimed tax benefits, the defendants allegedly worked with law firms to provide E&#038;Y&#8217;s clients with opinion letters that claimed the tax shelter losses or deductions would &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; survive IRS challenge, or &#8220;should&#8221; survive IRS challenge. However, the defendants allegedly knew those opinions were based upon false and fraudulent statements, and omitted material facts. As described in the conspiracy charge, by helping their clients obtain false and fraudulent opinion letters, with the understanding and intent that those opinion letters would be presented to the IRS if and when the clients were audited, the defendants sought to undermine theability of the IRS to ascertain the clients&#8217; tax liabilities and determine whether penalties should be imposed. The indictment alleges that the defendants and their co-conspirators undertook these actions so that E&#038;Y could participate in the highly lucrative tax shelter market in which other accounting firms were already participating; so that E&#038;Y could prevent its high-net-worth clients from taking their business (including, potentially, the highly prized audit business associated with some of these individuals) to its competitors; so that E&#038;Yâ€™s Personal Financial Counseling practice, a business unit that was not a substantial contributor to the firm&#8217;s revenues, could grow and prosper within the firm; and so the individual defendants could enhance their own opportunities for professional recognition, advancement, job security, and remuneration. Among the alleged fraudulent tax shelter transactions designed, marketed, and implemented by the defendants and theirco-conspirators were CDS (&#8221;Contingent Deferred Swap&#8221;); COBRA(&#8221;Currency Options Bring Reward Alternatives&#8221;); CDS Add-On; andPICO (&#8221;Personal Investment Corporation&#8221;). The iIndictment also charges defendant Robert Coplan with corruptly endeavoring to impede the due administration of the Internal Revenue laws by instructing E&#038;Y individuals to destroy documents related to the COBRA transaction when he knew of a pending IRS audit of the transaction. The Indictment charges defendants Coplan and Brian Vaughn with making false statements to the IRS in connection with an examination by the IRS of whether E&#038;Y had complied with various legal requirements applicable to the firm&#8217;s tax shelter activities. The indictment further charges defendants Coplan, Nissenbaum and Shapiro with implementing a tax shelter in 2000 to evade their own taxes, and with arranging for eight of their E&#038;Y partners to participate in the tax shelter transaction with them. Use of that tax shelter enabled the group of 11 E&#038;Y partners to eliminate a total of approximately $3.7 million in taxes. The indictment also charges Nissenbaum with corruptly obstructing the due administration of the Internal Revenue laws by providing false and misleading statements to the IRS on behalf of himself and 10 other E&#038;Y partners in connection with an audit of the 2000 tax returns of all 11 participants in the transaction.Â  5-30-07 Add this post to COPYRIGHT 2007 - NORTH COUNTRY GAZETTE All rights reserved.

The deal announced Wednesday will give MySpace and sister sites under News Corp.'s Fox Interactive Media access to Photobucket Inc.'s photo and video technologies, while Photobucket gets Fox's resources to accelerate development of its tools. Peter Levinsohn, president of Fox Interactive, said Photobucket also would be able to incorporate advanced slideshow generators and other editing tools from Flektor Inc., which Fox also announced Wednesday it bought. "Together, they represent a powerful combination and we are thrilled for them to join our network," Levinsohn said. Financial terms of the two deals were not disclosed. But three people familiar with the Photobucket deal, citing anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the price, said Fox was paying about $300 million for Photobucket, about half of the $580 million News Corp. paid in 2005 to buy MySpace. The Photobucket deal comes just weeks after a public spat in which MySpace partially blocked content from Photobucket. It was announced the same day CBS Corp. said it purchased global online social network Last.fm for $280 million in cash in a move to attract younger viewers and listeners across its businesses. MySpace offers a mix of messaging tools to encourage its youth-oriented visitors to expand their circles of friends. Central to the site are personal profile pages where users can post photos and video clips, blast messages to friends and have visitors leave comments. MySpace users often embed material from outside sites like Photobucket and Google Inc.'s YouTube, both of which make that easy by providing the programming code to cut and paste into MySpace profile pages. The practice has made Photobucket one of the leading sites on the Internet, even though relatively few access content directly through its home page. Under the deal, Photobucket would remain a standalone operation within Fox, and users of rival social-networking sites such as Facebook could continue to incorporate Photobucket content in their profiles. For now, Photobucket will continue to offer basic services for free, with a fee for more storage and other features. Most noticeable for users will be the acceleration of new editing tools, such as cropping and red-eye removal, Photobucket Chief Executive Alex Welch said. With the resources of a larger company, he said, Photobucket won't be spending much of its time "in a firefighting mode." According to Nielsen/NetRatings, the acquisition isn't likely to boost MySpace's audience given the significant overlap already between the two. MySpace alone had 56 million U.S. unique visitors in March, while Photobucket had 15 million. The combined audience would have been 58 million had the combination been in effect then. But Levinsohn said users don't hang out at two places at once, so the combination still would mean more time spent on Fox properties overall. And it could give Fox a foothold on sites run by its rivals, especially as Photobucket makes more sponsorship deals of the type that led to a block by MySpace in April. Photobucket had encouraged users to build slideshows promoting Sony Corp.'s "Spider-Man 3," which MySpace considered a violation of policies banning unauthorized commercial activities. The block was mysteriously lifted after about two weeks, but both sides had been silent on the details of their peacemaking. Executives from Fox and Photobucket said Wednesday that the acquisition talks were unrelated to that dispute. Fox's agreements to purchase Photobucket and Flektor represent the latest acquisitions of startups by larger Internet companies. In November, Google bought video-sharing site YouTube for $1.76 billion. The Flektor deal closed Tuesday, while the Photobucket acquisition was signed Tuesday and should close next month. Flektor's deal represents a coup for that site, which has been open to the public for only a month. Flektor, like Photobucket, will remain a standalone site, but Fox already has concrete plans to incorporate into MySpace its Web-based tools for creating slideshows, video mash-ups and other interactive presentations. Jason Rubin, Flektor's co-founder, said the deal lets the site grow its audience more quickly than it can alone. So far, he said, the site has fewer than 40,000 users, nearly all through word of mouth. Shares in News Corp. rose 25 cents, or 1 percent, to $23.97 Wednesday.

Before today’s numbers were released, it was clear the economy was downshifting from the rapid 5.6 percent expansion of the first quarter last year. But the new data reinforced how significant the slowdown has been. Growth advanced just 0.6 percent, compared with an initial estimate of 1.3 percent. It was the slowest rate recorded since the fourth quarter of 2002. The chief reasons for the revisions were adjustments to the estimates of imports and business inventories. Imports, which subtract from the gross domestic product, were stronger than the government first thought. At the same time, businesses cut production and accumulated smaller inventory stockpiles. Despite the adjustments to the growth figures, inflation in the first quarter was essentially unrevised. Prices excluding food and energy, a measure preferred by the Federal Reserve, advanced by 2.2 percent in the first quarter, still above what the central bank has said it considers acceptable. But there were some revisions to the numbers that economists said they found to be encouraging. Consumer spending, the staple of economic growth for the last decade, was revised higher. It advanced 4.4 percent in the first quarter, compared with an initial estimate of 3.8 percent. And the drag from the collapse in residential real estate was slightly less than the government first reported. Most economists agree that the first quarter was probably a low point for the last several years, and they expect the economy has regained some strength in the second quarter. Although consumer spending has probably slowed since the first quarter and the correction in the housing market is ongoing, economists expect demand from overseas to help businesses in the United States. “There are reasons to expect G.D.P. growth to improve,” said Richard Moody, chief economist with Mission Residential, a real estate investment firm in Austin, Texas.

The drug, Torisel, is made by Wyeth and is the third new kidney cancer drug approved since December 2005. The FDA had been expected to approve Torisel in April, but sought additional information from the company and pushed the expected approval date to July. Wyeth said the drug will be available in July.

Tillerson, continuing the conciliatory approach he undertook a year ago upon succeeding the combative Lee Raymond, patiently tried to convince environmental and social activists that Exxon Mobil is concerned about and is taking steps to address the possibility that human and industrial activity are causing global temperatures to rise. "We don't have a difference of views that it's an important issue," Tillerson said. "We have differences about what we know and what we don't know." A sizable group of activists critical of the company's environmental policies were among the 1,000 or so shareholders who turned out for the three-hour meeting at the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in downtown Dallas. One after another, critics took the microphone to criticize Exxon Mobil's past policies and support of groups that question the validity and the science behind the claims that global warming is largely caused by human consumption of fossil fuels. Framing their arguments in management terms, activists charged that Exxon Mobil's efforts have hurt the company's image and threatened to undermine its long-term financial viability. Andrew Logan of the Investor Network on Climate Risk pointedly asked why Exxon Mobil "has put so much effort into making itself public enemy Number 1 in terms of the global-warming debate" by openly opposing calls for the U.S. and foreign governments to make significant environmental policy changes. "You've sacrificed the company's reputation by taking a position that, it seems to me, is to the benefit of no one," Logan said. Tillerson, as he did repeatedly throughout the meeting, responded in measured tones. "We never set out to make the company public enemy Number 1," Tillerson said. Exxon's differences with global-warming activists, he said, have always been over the degree of certainty involved in the science of climate change. "What I find perplexing," Tillerson said, "is why people feel so threatened because we want to have a discussion" about the scientific issues "and what is known and what is not known." Even under Raymond, Tillerson said, Exxon Mobil has sought to support organizations that back work on the science of global warming and cutting carbon-dioxide emissions. Company scientists and engineers have played a role in the efforts of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has authored leading studies on climate change. Other critics, saying Exxon Mobil should seek to be a broad-based energy company, called for it to take a more active role and devote a share of its research and development funds and expertise in the development of alternative fuels rather than continue investing almost entirely in oil and gas production. "We do not oppose the development of alternatives to fossil fuels," Tillerson said, attempting to cool the discussion. But Exxon Mobil's expertise has made it the industry leader in oil and gas production and, Tillerson said, estimates of the world's rising energy requirements for the next 25 years show that the majority will still come from fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal. Tillerson's charm offensive may not be winning many converts among the ranks of environmental and social activists, but it may be lessening the tension somewhat. None of the 15 shareholder proposals, all opposed by management, was approved. But several gained more than 40 percent of the votes cast, a significant advance against the management opposition. A year ago, for the first time in memory, a management-opposed measure was approved. One of the rejected proposals called for the company to adopt specific goals for reducing its own carbon-dioxide emissions to help counter global warming. It received a 31 percent favorable vote. The proposal gaining the most support, 47.8 percent, would have amended the company's bylaws to allow shareholders representing 10 percent of the company's stock to call a special shareholders meeting. The com- pany said such a provision now exists, provided shareholders can show good cause in court to call such a meeting. Tillerson, at the conclusion of the meeting, extended an olive branch to the dissidents among the Exxon Mobil shareholders. "I really do appreciate all of your comments today and the respectful way they were presented." DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDER INITIATIVES Shareholders overwhelmingly approved the election of all Exxon Mobil's nominated directors. Economist Michael Boskin of the free-market oriented Hoover Institution at Stanford University received the least support, 93 percent of the vote. New director Steve Reinemund, former chairman and CEO of PepsiCo, received a 98 percent favorable vote. 7.8 percent favored a proposal to allow shareholders representing 10 percent of the company's stock to call a special shareholders meeting. The company said such a provision now exists, provided shareholders can show good cause in court. 7.2 percent supported a resolution asking the Exxon Mobil board to adopt a bylaw allowing the company to recoup unearned bonuses or other incentive payments to senior executives. 1.2 percent voted for a proposal that would have allowed shareholders to vote on an advisory resolution approving the pay and other compensation of senior company executives. 1 percent voted for the company to adopt specific goals for reducing its own carbon-dioxide emissions to help counter global warming.

The cellphone maker Motorola said it would cut another 4,000 jobs as part of a plan to improve sagging financial and operational results. The latest round of cuts means Motorola, the world&#039;s No. 2 handset maker, has announced plans to eliminate more than 10 percent of its work force since the start of 2007, when it became clear that two years of strong momentum behind its popular Razr phone had collapsed. The company is already eliminating 3,500 jobs as part of a two-year cost-cutting plan to save $400 million. Those layoffs, announced in January, are to be completed by June 30. Motorola said Wednesday that it would save another $600 million in 2008 by cutting 4,000 more workers, prioritizing investments and putting controls on discretionary spending and general and administrative expenses. US economy grows by just 0.6 percent in the first quarter Wachovia buys A.G. Edwards for $6.8 billion . Deutsche Telekom executive who once worked at Siemens to leave company The company did not specify where the new cuts would be made. A spokeswoman, Jennifer Weyrauch, said they would be achieved through a mixture of attrition and layoffs. The company expects to take a restructuring charge of $300 million, or 8 cents per share, in 2007, from severance and related expenses from staff cuts. Tom Meredith, Motorola&#039;s chief financial executive, said the move was an "update to the commitment" the company had made "to drive out additional costs, and a continuation of the plan we announced in January." Motorola&#039;s work force, which stood at 150,000 people worldwide as recently as 2000, had declined to 66,000 at the beginning of the year. Weyrauch said the company, which has acquired several smaller firms in recent months, also is continuing to hire. It remains to be seen whether it can come up with a hit successor to the Razr, the success of which has been eroded by declining sale prices and competitors&#039; new phones. Wall Street appeared to modestly approve of the latest cuts. Motorola shares rose 12 cents in extended-hours trading after closing the regular session down 2 cents at $18.28. "From a cost-cutting perspective, these are steps in the right direction for the long term," said John Slack, a Morningstar analyst. "But the big issue to underscore is that products in the market are the key, and that is a slow ship to turn." Motorola began to cut back in January in an effort to recover from a series of miscues that caused it to lose about a third of its market value since October. It had ridden the Razr to significant gains in the world cellphone market for two years, closing the gap on its rival Nokia. But its strategy of cutting prices sharply to sell more units backfired, hammering its profit margins. Exacerbating its troubles, Ron Garriques departed abruptly in February as head of the cellphone unit. This spring, the company posted its first quarterly loss since 2004 and executives indicated that its efforts had not gone far enough. Motorola has already warned that its results from the April-June quarter will not be good.

Expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year fell to the lowest since last July as the National Association for Purchasing Management-Chicago report indicated the economy is rebounding from a first-quarter slowdown. U.S. equities extended an advance that yesterday pushed the Standard & Poor&#39;s 500 Index to a record. ``I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see people change their minds and raise the probability of the Fed hiking,&#39;&#39; said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, co-head of U.S. fixed-income strategy in New York at Barclays Capital, one of the 21 primary dealers that underwrite the U.S. government&#39;s debt. ``Yields will continue to move higher.&#39;&#39; The 10-year note&#39;s yield, which moves inversely to its price, rose more than 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.9022 percent at 11:33 a.m. in New York, according to bond broker Cantor Fitzgerald LP. Earlier it touched 4.917 percent, the highest since Aug. 16. Until today, the highest level of the year was 4.902 percent on Jan. 26. The price of 4 1/2 percent notes maturing in May 2017 fell 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000 face amount, to 96 27/32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose from a record, and the Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets Index increased the most since March, approaching its May 22 record. ``Overlap the S&P and the 10-year contract, and you&#39;d see a very good correlation,&#39;&#39; said Jeffry Feigenwinter, head of U.S. Treasury trading at primary dealer BNP Paribas Securities Corp. in New York. ``Everybody thinks the market&#39;s cheap, but it&#39;s really still expensive&#39;&#39; relative to the overnight lending rate set by the Fed. The NAPM-Chicago&#39;s business barometer rose to 61.7 in May from 52.9 in April. Readings greater than 50 signal expansion. The median forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg was for a smaller increase to 54.0. ``We&#39;ll have to see if this follows through with the ISM number tomorrow,&#39;&#39; said Theodore Ake, head of U.S. government bond trading in New York at primary dealer Mizuho Securities USA Inc. He referred to the Institute for Supply Management&#39;s manufacturing index. The median forecast was for a decline to 54.0 from 54.7 in April. On a comparable increase in that gauge, ``the market&#39;s going to have to take out the fact that the next move from the Fed is an ease, and that any kind of ease in 2007 is out of the question,&#39;&#39; Ake said. Yields on Eurodollar futures expiring in December rose to the highest since July as traders pared bets on interest-rate cuts by the Fed. The yields forecast the interest rate on three- month bank deposits, which closely tracks the Fed&#39;s target for the overnight lending rate between banks. The three-month deposit rate, also known as Libor, is 5.36 percent. The federal funds target is 5.25 percent. The December Eurodollar futures yield rose 3 basis points to 5.285 percent, the highest since July 25. The market had little reaction to a government report showing the U.S. economy in the first quarter expanded at a slower pace than originally estimated. Gross domestic product grew at a rate of 0.6 percent, compared with an initial estimate of 1.3 percent, the Commerce Department said. The median forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg was for a revision to 0.8 percent. While the pace of GDP growth was the weakest in more than four years, reports have shown that business spending has improved in the second quarter. Minutes of Fed policy makers&#39; most recent meeting, released yesterday, showed they still expect growth to accelerate this year and are primarily concerned about inflation. A Labor Department report released at the same time as the GDP report showed new claims for state unemployment insurance benefits last week fell below their average for all of last year, pointing to strength in the labor market. The department&#39;s monthly employment report for May is forecast to show job creation accelerated. First-time claims for state jobless benefits fell to 310,000 for the week ended May 26, from a revised 314,000 during the prior period. Last year&#39;s average was 313,000. Treasuries may benefit later today from the monthly rebalancing of bond indexes to include securities issued during the month. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., whose U.S. investment-grade bond indexes are used as benchmarks by managers of $2.5 trillion, estimated the duration of its U.S. Treasury Index will increase by 0.22 years when the index is rebalanced, the most since August 2002. Duration measures price sensitivity to changes in yield, and is partly a function of maturity. Some portfolio managers buy bonds around the time of a rebalancing that causes the index&#39;s duration to lengthen. The so- called index extensions in February, May, August and November are larger than in other months because 10-year notes and 30-year bonds are sold then. Lehman&#39;s indexes are rebalanced at 3 p.m. New York time on the last business day of the month. Bonds issued during the month move into the index, and ones that no longer fit the index criteria are removed. The duration of the Treasury index was 4.77 years yesterday.

Based in Englewood, Colo., Jeppesen is the world's largest provider of flight information services, such as the navigation charts that pilots use. It produces more than 2 billion such charts a year. The Boeing Co. acquired Jeppesen in August 2000 as part of its strategy to expand in the aviation services business, which Boeing estimated at the time would generate more than $2.6 trillion over the next two decades. The $1.5 billion in cash Boeing paid for the company was about six times Jeppesen's 1999 revenue of $235 million. Boeing has continued to grow Jeppesen, but it does not break out that revenue separately from overall sales in commercial airplanes. In its bid to acquire Jeppesen from the Tribune Co., Boeing had to beat out 10 other competitors. The media giant shed Jeppesen to help pay off debt after its purchase of the Los Angeles Times. When Boeing acquired Jeppesen, then-Boeing Chairman and Chief Executive Phil Condit had this to say: "This really is the glue to providing a whole set of information services. In the long run, we are trying to buy a business that can continue to grow." Jeppesen has since provided Boeing with an important and consistent revenue stream, according to industry analysts, although the amount is probably tiny compared with the more than $40 billion in annual sales generated by Boeing's jetliner business.

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070531.RMACKENZIE31/TPStory/Business&cid globeandmail.com: Exxon warns it will shelve Mackenzie pipe without subsidy Letters to the Editor Exxon warns it will shelve Mackenzie pipe without subsidy Oil giant says project isn't viable without federal assistance GLOBAL ENERGY REPORTER, With files from Reuters , one of the world's biggest oil companies, has turned up the heat on the Canadian government, saying the company will shelve the long-delayed Mackenzie Valley pipeline project unless it can get significant taxpayers' assistance for it. Rex Tillerson, Exxon's chief executive officer, told reporters at the company's annual meeting in Dallas yesterday that the $16.2-billion price tag for the 1,200-kilometre natural gas pipeline means that it is not viable without sizable federal aid. &#34;We are now in a situation where it's not economic at current costs,&#34; Mr. Tillerson said, noting the tremendous inflation that has plagued oil field construction projects. He said it is not clear if the federal government will come forward with a package of royalty and tax breaks large enough to provide the project sponsors with a decent rate of return. Print Edition - Section Front &#34;It may just be that the project is going to have to wait for a different cost environment,&#34; he said. The pipeline would carry up to 1.9 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from the Canadian Arctic to Alberta, and is seen as a critical piece of infrastructure in opening the North to resource development. Exxon owns 69.6 per cent of of Calgary, which is leading the project, currently under review by the National Energy Board. Earlier this year, Imperial announced that the projected cost for the Mackenzie Valley pipeline had ballooned to $16.2-billion from $7.5-billion, and that the partners would require &#34;an appropriate fiscal framework&#34; from the government to allow it to go ahead. Since then, the company and the federal government have been in discussions, although industry insiders believe Imperial is asking far more than Ottawa is prepared to give. Imperial spokesman Pius Rolheiser said yesterday that the company remains committed to the pipeline construction and continues to negotiate with northern native groups and the government as it pursues regulatory approval. &#34;Yes, it's economically challenged, yes we're concerned about its competitiveness, and to that end, we continue to work with the federal government on a fiscal framework that makes sense for the project, which we see as key to improving its competitiveness,&#34; he said. But Mr. Rolheiser would not repeat Mr. Tillerson's assertion that the project is &#34;uneconomic,&#34; retreating to the more vague description, &#34;economically challenged.&#34; Nor would he comment on Mr. Tillerson's suggestion that the project might be shelved. Bill Rodgers, a spokesman for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, Jim Prentice, said the minister was unaware of Mr. Tillerson's comments, but that the government has had no indication Imperial is ready to walk away from the project or put it on the shelf. &#34;Nothing has changed as far as we can tell,&#34; he said. UBS Securities analyst Andrew Potter said it has been clear for some time that Imperial was unwilling to move forward with the project unless it gets generous tax and royalty breaks from Ottawa. Mr. Potter said he believes the pipeline project could yield an 8-per-cent rate of return at current natural gas prices on spot markets, but noted that Exxon and Imperial are notoriously cautious about using conservative price estimates for project planning. &#34;Uneconomic means different things to different people,&#34; he said. The analyst added that the federal government is hesitant to be seen as providing subsidies to the world's most profitable oil company but, at the same time, is eager to see the project proceed because it would open the North to further natural gas development. &#34;It's a strategic project for the nation; it's a strategic project for North American gas supply,&#34; he said.

China's domestic stock market fell 8 percent, its fourth straight losing session, following last week's hike in the share trading tax. Nevertheless, markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul ended higher, and European markets were only marginally lower on Monday. "The market opened down on the Chinese news, but I think we can shake that off. The reason that market is down is because of what the (Chinese) government is doing," said Victor Pugliese, director of listed equity trading at First Albany Corp. in San Francisco. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 24.79 points, or 0.18 percent, at 13,643.32. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 1.25 points, or 0.08 percent, at 1,535.09. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 2.40 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,611.52. Stocks briefly pared some of their losses after data on April orders for durable goods was revised to show a bigger-than-expected 0.8 percent rise. The report said factory orders rose less than expected. Airline stocks fell after Continental Airlines reported lower revenues per passenger in May, an early sign of weakness going into the key summer travel season. Continental shares dropped 4 percent to $38.14. , parent of United Airlines, fell down 6.2 percent to $36.36 and was the worst percentage loser on the Nasdaq 100.

The Standard & Poor's 500 Index moved 2.8 points higher to a record 1,539, and the added 4.4 points to 2,618. While gains are gains, they were limited by an 8.3% decline in stocks in Shanghai and a 1.7% gain in crude oil futures in New York to $66.21 a gallon, and a 4% gain in natural gas to $8.191 per million British thermal units. Pushing the commodities higher was a forecast that Cyclone Gonu would enter the Persian Gulf tomorrow and possibly disrupt shipments of crude oil from the oil fields of that region. Also, there were signs that consumers are not changing their driving habits in the face of higher gasoline prices. U.S. demand was up 2.4% in May, Bloomberg News noted. And there were concerns a strike in Nigeria over higher taxes would limit production from oil fields there. At the same time, the market has shown remarkable resilience. Mostly, CNBC's Bob Pisani said this afternoon, that's due to the flood of deals and stock buybacks, a sense that stocks are decently priced and high skepticism about the rally that forces some traders to buy to cover short positions.

China's stock market tumbled today with the Shanghai Composite Index falling 8.3%. Today's falloff totaled more than 330 points and was its biggest one-day point drop since Feb. 27, when the index plunged 9%. The February sell-off sent shivers across the globe and helped push the Dow down 416 points -- the index's biggest one-day point loss since the stock market opened after Sept. 11, 2001. "There's panic selling" in China, money manager Yan Ji at HSBC Jintrust Fund Management in Shanghai told Bloomberg News. "Investors are convinced the government won't do anything to support the market." China's market had risen 62% for the year as of May 29. It has fallen 15.3% since the government tripled the tax on stock transactions. But the Chinese sell-off had little effect in other markets. The German, British and Japanese stock markets were little changed. But Briefing.com noted that the sell-off is again serving as a reminder that the U.S. stock market, which has also gotten ahead of fundamentals, is due for a pullback.

The Bancroft family holds 64% of the voting power in Dow Jones. "I can't put down $5 billion of my shareholders' money and not be able to run the business," the elder Murdoch told the newspaper.

http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070603/black_trump_070604/20070604%3Fhub%3DTorontoHome&cid CTV.ca | Defence wants David Radler back at Black trial CTV News with Lloyd Robertson Former media mogul Conrad Black arrives at federal court in Chicago, Wednesday, May 30, 2007. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) Donald Trump watches an NBA playoff game in Los Angeles on Thursday, April 26, 2007. (AP / Mark J. Terrill) Defence wants David Radler back at Black trial Updated Mon. Jun. 4 2007 4:24 PM ET Defence lawyers sought Monday to be granted another chance to question Conrad Black's longtime partner David Radler, while it became clear Donald Trump would not appear. They filed a motion asking the Chicago court "to require the government to produce F. David Radler for examination in the defence case." Radler, who already has pleaded guilty to one count of fraud, took the stand against Black in exchange for a more lenient sentence. Donald Trump was expected to take the stand Monday at Conrad Black's fraud trial in Chicago but it looks like the real estate magnate won't testify. "The defence generally all along has played it pretty close to the vest so far as to the order of their witnesses," CTV's David Akin reported from the courthouse in Chicago. It's unclear why Trump remained in New York on Monday. The mogul was expected to tell the court about a dinner he attended that was charged to Hollinger International. Prosecutors have accused Black of abusing company perks and have cited the lavish New York dinner, which cost US$62,869, as an example. Defence lawyers argue that Trump attended the dinner while negotiating to buy the Chicago Sun-Times building from Hollinger International, making the dinner a business event and thus justifying the costs. "It is risky because if the jury senses that the defence is playing with their emotions -- that this is just a trophy witness, that you're utilizing and exploiting celebrity to try to fool them -- then it has the opposite effect and it damages Conrad Black," said CTV legal analyst Steven Skurka. At the heart of the case, Black, 62, and former Hollinger vice presidents John Boultbee and Peter Atkinson are accused of devising a scheme to improperly pocket millions of dollars in fees in exchange for promising not to compete with buyers of Hollinger publications. Mark Kipnis, a lawyer for Hollinger, is also on trial, accused of facilitating the alleged fraud. The accused deny any wrongdoing and claim they did properly report any non-compete income. Black's lawyers are just beginning to lay out their defence after 11 weeks of accusations by prosecutors. Maclean's editor Ken Whyte, who worked for Black at the National Post, was back on the stand Monday. Black's butler is expected to take the stand after him. Closing arguments in the case could be heard by June 18, with a possible verdict as soon as July 1, reported Akin.

The justices today said the Fair Credit Reporting Act doesn&#39;t require insurers to notify every consumer who is offered something short of the lowest premiums when seeking a rate quote or applying for a policy. ``Notices as common as these would take on the character of formalities, and formalities tend to be ignored,&#39;&#39; Justice David Souter wrote for seven of the court&#39;s nine justices. The court also unanimously limited the applicability of a provision that permits damage awards even when consumers don&#39;t suffer any injury. Although the justices didn&#39;t go as far as the insurance industry had sought, they said Safeco wasn&#39;t subject to the provision because it didn&#39;t recklessly violate the law. The insurance industry had said it faced the prospect of billions of dollars in damage claims had it lost the high court case. Some 2,600 lawsuits alleging violations of the fair-credit law are pending in federal courts, according to filings at the Supreme Court. The ``most critical aspects&#39;&#39; of the ruling favored the industry, said David F. Snyder, a lawyer with the American Insurance Association. ``The Supreme Court balanced both consumer needs and business needs in a common-sense decision.&#39;&#39; The ruling may also bolster other financial services companies, including credit-card companies fighting lawsuits over pre-approval letters sent to consumers and retailers defending against claims that center on the inclusion of expiration dates on credit-card receipts. Today&#39;s ruling overturned a decision by the San Francisco- based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which had let cases go forward against Safeco, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#39;s Geico and other insurers. ``We&#39;re disappointed, and it&#39;s not a good result for consumers, but there are some good silver linings in the case,&#39;&#39; said the consumers&#39; lead lawyer, Scott A. Shorr. He said it&#39;s ``too early to say&#39;&#39; whether any aspects of his cases will go forward. Shorr is pressing similar cases against several other insurers, including State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. In Safeco&#39;s case, two customers said they should have been notified that better credit scores would have reduced their premiums for their auto and renters insurance policies. In the Geico case, a would-be customer said he wasn&#39;t told that his credit history prevented him from getting the company&#39;s lowest rate when he called for a quote. The dispute asked the Supreme Court to decide whether insurers had to notify every customer who would have received a better rate with a perfect credit score. Disclosure is required under the fair-credit law only when a low credit score results in an ``adverse action.&#39;&#39; Souter said insurers need provide notice only when they would have provided a lower rate using a ``neutral score&#39;&#39; approach -- that is, one that doesn&#39;t consider the consumer&#39;s score. He rejected consumer and Bush administration arguments that the standard would leave a ``loophole&#39;&#39; penalizing applicants who have inaccurate credit reports yet manage to score higher than the neutral level. ``Assuming that Congress meant a notice of adverse action to get some attention, we think the cost of closing the loophole would be too high,&#39;&#39; Souter wrote. Two justices, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, said they would have adopted the approach advocated by the government and consumers. Stevens said in a concurring opinion that insurers will be ``free to adopt whatever `neutral&#39; credit scores they want&#39;&#39; and that those scores ``will in many cases be quite low.&#39;&#39; The court also restricted a provision that subjects ``willful&#39;&#39; violators to penalties ranging from $100 to $1,000 per consumer, even if the consumers weren&#39;t harmed. The 9th Circuit said the willfulness requirement includes actions taken in ``reckless disregard&#39;&#39; of the law. Souter rejected insurer contentions that the provision incorporates only intentional violations while at the same time setting a high bar for consumers seeking to show recklessness. Souter said Safeco hadn&#39;t acted recklessly, in part because its view of the statute&#39;s notification requirements ``has a foundation in the statutory text.&#39;&#39; He pointed to a federal trial judge&#39;s agreement with the insurers on the issue. ``Where, as here, the statutory text and relevant court and agency guidance allow for more than one reasonable interpretation, it would defy history and current thinking to treat a defendant who merely adopts one such interpretation as a knowing or reckless violator,&#39;&#39; Souter wrote. The high court&#39;s approach to recklessness probably will help the credit-card issuers and retailers in their fights under the fair-credit law, according to Anne P. Fortney, a Washington lawyer who filed a brief in the insurance case on behalf of the trade group representing credit-reporting companies. ``There are many provisions in the act that are subject to more than one reasonable interpretation,&#39;&#39; she said. Ford Motor Co. and trade groups for the mortgage-lending, insurance and banking industries were among those who filed briefs backing Safeco and Geico. The cases are Safeco v. Burr, 06-84, and Geico v. Edo, 06- 100.

The move creates a company with $30 billion in annual revenue and leaves traders wondering what firm could be the next potential takeover target. ) will pay $4.2 billion in cash and stock, including the assumption of debt. Solectron ) investors have a choice of $3.89 of cash or 0.345 share of Flextronic stock, worth $3.96 on Monday morning. Solectron's shares jumped 14.3%, or 48 cents, to $3.85 in midday trading, while Flextronics slipped 1.9%, or 22 cents, to $11.48. "Solectron's strength in the high-end computing and telecom segments will be an invaluable addition to Flextronics' existing capabilities, and the combined company will be a market leader in most product market segments," said Flextronic's Chief Executive In an interview with Forbes.com, Standard & Poor's equity analyst Jawahar Hingorani said he approved of the move. "For Flextronics, rather than doing a lot of capital spending, they immediately pick up access to capital markets," Hingorani said. "They can now serve more clients on the networking and computing side. And they pick up new clients like Alcatel-Lucent." He added: "Overall, they get deeper penetration into existing end markets like computing, networking, medical and automotive." The deal also makes good sense for those Solectron investors, Hingorani contended. While the company's revenue has been rising in recent months, its operating income has not. "So, for Solectron shareholders," he said, "this eliminates some frustration. Now they become part of a better-run company. The combination creates a much bigger and more strategically positioned market leader." Although Solectron investors have a choice of accepting cash or Flextronics stock, Flextronics said it will pay a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 70% in shares. Hingorani said that the headline-making takeover announced on Monday will generate attention about which company could be the next target. "This draws attention to other players and whether they could become targets as well," he said. One possiblity could be "The company has substantial revenue but operational issues in Mexico and Europe," he pointed out. "They had a stock options probe that took a toll on them. I think from a valuation perspective, they are on the lower end. Maybe someone comes in and gets them."

Violent crime increased 1.3 percent last year over 2005, with robbery rising 6 percent and murder and non-negligent manslaughter 0.3 percent, the FBI said in its preliminary annual crime report released today. Property crime, which includes motor vehicle thefts and larceny, decreased 2.9 percent. The report may fuel critics of the Bush administration&#39;s crime policies, including many police chiefs and mayors who say the rise in crime is the result of federal funding cuts. Last week, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales proposed new legislation that would increase penalties for some violent crimes and restore mandatory minimum sentences. ``It doesn&#39;t appear that the current data reveal nationwide trends,&#39;&#39; Gonzales said at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives headquarters in Washington last week. ``Rather, they show local increases in certain communities.&#39;&#39; According to the report, the rise in violent crime was greatest, with a 3.2 percent increase, in cities with populations between 250,000 and 499,999 and between 25,000 to 49,999. Cities with 1 million or more residents had the biggest rise in murders, 6.7 percent. Forcible rapes fell by 1.9 percent and aggravated assaults were down 0.7 percent. Brian Roehrkasse, a Justice Department spokesman, said today&#39;s report ``shows that overall crime remains historically low in America.&#39;&#39; The 1.3 percent rise, he added, ``is still of concern and the reason why the attorney general has acted to expand federal efforts to combat violent crime.&#39;&#39; In 2005, violent crime in the U.S. rose 2.3 percent -- the first increase since 2001. The FBI collected its data from 11,723 law enforcement agencies. The preliminary figures may change slightly when the bureau releases its final annual report in September.

Sign Up For E-Mail News Alerts Faces, Places Of Meth FBI: Meth To Blame For Overall Jump In Violent Crime Feds Say Robberies Up 6 Percent POSTED: 2:53 pm CDT June 4, 2007 UPDATED: 3:12 pm CDT June 4, 2007 Sign Up for Breaking News Alerts After a 39 percent decrease over 13 years, the FBI says violent crime is rising in the United States. And they attribute that in part to meth use. The FBI on Monday released its preliminary crime numbers for 2006, showing violent crime is on the rise for a second straight year. The number has been pushed up by a 6 percent increase in robberies, and federal officials said they believe that increase is being fueled by a nationwide spike in methamphetamine use. Though violent crime numbers have gone up only modestly, the FBI said there is reason for concern, because the statistics suggest a national methamphetamine epidemic may be pushing those numbers higher. The just-released uniform crime report for 2006 shows murder and non-negligent manslaughter are up three tenths of a percent , including a 6.7 percent jump in big cities over a million people. The biggest increase was in robberies -- up 6 percent. Overall, it's just a 1.3 percent increase in violent crime over 2005, but the climb has been steady. "For the last two years, counting these preliminary numbers, we are showing an increase. But, I think that would be too soon to call it a major trend upward," said Sgt. Tom Bush, the FBI assistant director of the Criminal Justice Information System. While the FBI is focusing on drugs and gangs as a possible cause, local law enforcement agencies are pointing a finger at the federal government, which has been slashing funds for community policing over the past five years. Congress is now fighting to reinstate those grants. In the meantime, the FBI says it's broadening its Safe Streets violent crime task forces. Three of the nation's four geographic regions reported an increase in violent crime, while the northeast was virtually unchanged. . All rights reserved.

Smart phone maker Palm said Monday it was selling a 25 percent stake in the company to private equity firm Elevation Partners in a move aimed at regaining an edge in the competitive market. The deal will give the once-hot Silicon Valley group an injection of 325 million dollars. Elevation will pay 8.50 dollars per share for a new series of convertible preferred Palm stock. This was calculated to be a 16 percent premium to its average trading price in the past 10 sessions. Palm called the move a "strategic recapitalization" that will be coupled with 400 million dollars of new debt. As part of the deal, Jon Rubinstein, a former Apple senior vice president of hardware engineering and head of its iPod division, will join Palm as executive chairman of the board. Fred Anderson and Roger McNamee, managing directors and co-founders of Elevation, will join Palm's board of directors. Rubinstein, Anderson and McNamee will replace Eric Benhamou and Scott Mercer. "As a result of this transaction, we will strengthen the Palm leadership team and create a more effective capital structure, which puts us in a great position to attract new talent, significantly strengthen our execution capabilities, and deliver long-term shareholder value," said Ed Colligan, Palm president and chief executive. Palm in its most recent quarter reported a 60 percent drop in profits amid higher market costs and slipping market share of its Treo smart phone in favor of others such as the BlackBerry made by Canada's Research in Motion. The move comes as Apple is set to launch its new iPhone aimed at combining the capacities of its wildly popular iPod music player with a smart phone. Palm is launching a new device called the Foleo billed as "the first computer designed to be a companion to a smart phone," with a full-size keyboard and Internet access.

The original story and press release follows. Much of today's conference call (which will be available at 2:00pm EST) rehashed what was previously available in the . However, there were a few interesting notes that might interest the Palm community. Most of the financial details are above my head, but the major point seems to be that Palm is distributing most of its current "excess cash" to current shareholders, to the tune of $9 a share. Also notable is that Palm is going to be taking on more debt than they currently have (which isn't difficult, given that their current debt is zero), which Palm says is "the right capital for Palm on the right terms." It's very tough for this non-expert to understand, but the combination of the cash distribution and the new debt seems to have two benefits: a reward to investors who've hung on during these tough times and a method for keeping those investors in the majority of shareholders (i.e. 75%). All of this is planned to happen during the 3rd quarter pending shareholder and SEC (thanks for the fix, samkim!) approval. One exciting piece for the Palm faithful is that Palm is still in control of its own destiny. Elevation will have a 25% share of Palm, to be sure, but the executive team of Ed Colligan, Jeff Hawkins, et al will remain in place. In fact, the management team will become even stronger with the addition of fresh blood to the board of directors. More specifically, Jon Rubinstein was mentioned early and often during the conference call. His experience leading the iPod and iMac teams are a big plus for Palm. One notable quote: He also lead the team that built the iMac and incorporated into Apple's products a pair of little known technologies that became commonplace as a result: USB and WiFi. ...Let's hope that USB (in the form of standard mini-USB plugs) and WiFi become "commonplace" in Palm's products, too. ;) During the Q&A, Elevation's Roger McNamee talked about how important it was for the firm to invest in the mobile space and - more importantly - how important software is to the mobile space. You all know that Apple's about to enter the marketplace with the iPhone and we have every reason to believe that's going to be an incredibly successful product. To us that's incredibly good news because it suggests that this is an opportunity to really bring software to the fore and really re-engineer people's expectations for mobile devices. To Elevation's thinking, it won't be long before form-factor isn't going to be a major, well, for mobile devices. There's only so many ways that a small mobile device can be shaped, from a hardware perspective. It looks like Elevation is hoping that Palm will be able to catch-up to slimmer devices like the iPhone or the Motorola Q. Once that's done, Palm's new Linux-based PalmOS should, Palm and Elevation hope, put them ahead of the rest of the competition. McNamee explains (emphasis mine): We've now hit the point, I think, where it's hard to make the devices smaller without giving up the functionality people need. That obviously was an issue for Palm - the company was out of phase from a product development cycle relative to the [rest of the] industry for the last 12 months. [...] Palm will close that gap relatively soon, at which point we think the game is all about software and we think software is the place where this company truly excels. So, to sum up - Palm is indeed working on new form factors, is working on innovating on the software and user-experience side of things (where the action will primarily be in the very near future), and has a team of innovators at the head of the company. Palm is calling this a "Transformative Event" and I'd have to say that I agree. How long it will be before we truly see the effects of this transformation, though is anybody's guess. sent out this morning, Palm, Inc announced something very similar to what many have been expecting: a significant infusion of capital by a private equity firm, As a part of the deal, Elevation will invest $325 million, Palm will further incur $400 million of other debt to use for capital, and shareholders will receive a distribution of $9 per share in cash. Elevation Partners is a private equity firm, best known for being co-founded by U2's . Although many rumors has Palm being bought out by a more well known company such as Motorola or Nokia, Palm itself has vigorously quashed those rumors in the past. Many expected a private equity buyout instead, but Palm has managed to keep its independence mostly intact after this deal, as Elevations's stake in Palm will be about 25% after the deal. that many industry analysts were expecting. The move appears to primarily leave Palm's management structure intact, although it does include a small shakeup to Palm's board of directors. , formerly the head of Apple's iPod division, will becomes the new executive chairman of the board for Palm. Also new to the board, former Apple CFO Fred Anderson. The relevant information from the press release is below, with emphasis added to what seem to be the biggest pieces of news. SUNNYVALE, Calif., Jun 04, 2007 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Palm, Inc., (Nasdaq:PALM) today announced a strategic relationship with the private-equity firm Elevation Partners ("Elevation") and a recapitalization plan that will position Palm to lead the next phase of the smartphone and mobile-computing markets. Under the planned recapitalization, shareholders will receive a $9 per share cash distribution. Elevation will invest $325 million in Palm, and the company will utilize these proceeds along with existing cash and $400 million of new debt to finance the cash distribution. Upon closing of the transaction, Jon Rubinstein, former senior vice president of hardware engineering and head of the iPod division at Apple, will join Palm as executive chairman of the board. Fred Anderson and Roger McNamee, managing directors and co-founders of Elevation, will join Palm's board of directors upon closing of the transaction. , who will resign from Palm's board of directors at that time. The total number of directors on the board will be increased from eight to nine in connection with the transaction. "As a result of this transaction, we will strengthen the Palm leadership team and create a more effective capital structure, which puts us in a great position to attract new talent, significantly strengthen our execution capabilities, and deliver long-term shareholder value," said Ed Colligan, Palm president and chief executive officer. Colligan continued: "Jon Rubinstein is one of the top engineering executives in Silicon Valley, and he will lead our product-development efforts. As a significant new investor, Elevation brings onboard unique partners and relationships, plus a long investment horizon. For shareholders, the recapitalization provides an immediate return on their investments and our shareholders will retain their ability to participate in the company's success and future growth." "This is by far the largest investment that Elevation has ever made, which reflects our enthusiasm for Palm and its opportunity. This investment fits perfectly with Elevation's investment strategy of partnering with great management teams to transform businesses in industries with dynamic technology change," said Roger McNamee. "We see Palm as uniquely positioned to deliver the integrated software and hardware solutions that will drive the next generation of mobile computing." Jon Rubinstein added, "I have tremendous respect for Ed Colligan, Jeff Hawkins and their team, and I am thrilled by the prospect of helping Palm deliver innovative products capable of transforming the mobile-device market. Approximately 1 billion cell phones are sold each year, and mobile computing is a category with enormous potential. This is a company with an impressive history of introducing game-changing products -- it pioneered the smartphone -- and I intend to help extend that legacy." Under the terms of the recapitalization plan, Elevation will purchase $325 million of a new series of convertible preferred stock. The conversion price will be $8.50 per share, which represents a premium of approximately 16 percent to the implied post-distribution price over the 10 trading days ended June 1, 2007, excluding the $9 per share cash distribution. Upon completion of the transaction, Elevation will own approximately 25 percent of Palm's outstanding common stock on an as-converted and diluted basis, based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of March 30, 2007. The company has secured commitments for $400 million of new debt and a $40 million revolving credit facility which is not expected to be drawn at closing. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley will be joint bookrunners for these facilities. Palm intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the preferred stock, existing cash and the proceeds from the $400 million of new debt to fund the cash distribution. The amount of total proceeds to be distributed to shareholders is estimated to be approximately $940 million. The distribution is expected to be treated as a return of capital for most shareholders(1). Elevation will not be eligible to participate in the cash distribution. The distribution represents more than one-half of Palm's current market capitalization and enables existing equity holders to retain nearly three-quarters of the post-transaction equity on a fully diluted basis. The company expects to have more than $300 million of cash on the balance sheet after the distribution. The recapitalization is expected to close in the third quarter of the calendar year and is subject to shareholder approval, customary regulatory approvals including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and other customary closing conditions. A definitive purchase agreement has been executed. The board of directors of Palm has unanimously approved the purchase agreement. Morgan Stanley is serving as financial advisor to Palm; Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin Advisory Services, Inc. has provided a fairness opinion to Palm; and JPMorgan is acting as financial advisor to Elevation. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, is serving as outside counsel to Palm; and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP is acting as legal advisor to Elevation.

The Quebec-based company received US$2.36 billion in cash and 250 million shares of Rite Aid common stock that provide about 32 per cent common equity interest in the U.S. giant. "The completion of this transaction is a transformational event for the shareholders of The Jean Coutu Group," pharmacy chairman Jean Coutu said in a news release. Email to a friend "The company has seized a unique strategic opportunity to optimize its U.S. presence by taking its investment in a regional drugstore chain and changing it into the leading ownership position in a national chain." Jean Coutu has gained about US$500 million since the deal was announced last August because Rite Aid shares have jumped by more than 50 per cent to US6.52. The deal virtually wipes out Jean Coutu Group's debt and paves the way for it to potentially enhance its position as a leader in the Canadian drug store market. Closing of the deal was delayed a few weeks until the Federal Trade Commission accepted on Friday a consent agreement requiring Rite Aid to divest its self of 23 stores in nine states. The company will also sell three other stores. On Aug. 24, 2006, Jean Coutu Group announced it had reached agreement to sell its network of about 1,854 Brooks and Eckerd stores and six distribution centres, primarily in the Eastern U.S. Jean Coutu shares gained 10 cents to $14.70 in trading Monday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They have gained steadily from about $10 when the deal with Rite Aid was announced. Â© The Canadian Press 2007 Scandal Sheet: Brad Pitt Brad Pitt was spotted in Montreal...

Wealth managers and private banks are expanding to meet the demand from the growing numbers of affluent but â€œtime-poorâ€ investors who want professionals to manage their money for them and treat them as a name and not an account number. The bracket between Â£100,000 and Â£250,000 is below the traditional private banking threshold of Â£500,000 but private banks and wealth managers see this sector as the fastest-growing segment of the market. Many of the private banks, several of them acquired recently by high street banks, are targeting the newly affluent. They want to reach a new generation of high- earning clients who are growing in number by 7-10 per cent a year, according to research by business strategy consultants MDRC. The growth of wealth management and private banking is in contrast to dwindling branch networks and declining service offered by the high street banks. The private banks and wealth managers are opening new offices. Lloyds TSB has started opening private banking lounges in high street branches around the UK to offer an exclusive service to its clients. Recent openings include Richmond Upon Thames and the Law Courts in London. Many of the private banks and wealth managers promise old-fashioned personal service â€“ if they like the size of your portfolio. Lloyds TSB Private Banking has 45,000 clients and targets those with assets of Â£250,000 or more but will consider those below, especially those with potential to add to their wealth. It will also take on clients with Â£100,000 who want to use its asset management service. Independent financial advisers are targeting the affluent too and enjoy the biggest wealth management market share at 33 per cent. US-based wealth manager and stockbroker Edward Jones is expanding rapidly and already has more than 100 offices in the UK, the fastest-growing â€œmass affluentâ€ market in Europe. As the banks and wealth managers have stepped up their services, research suggests that the demographics of the sector are changing rapidly. The number of traditionally wealthy, passing family wealth between generations, is static and has been overtaken by growth in the high- earner category. Many of these are City workers enjoying high salaries and bonuses and those running their own businesses. MDRC chief executive Richard Williams says that growth in the high-earner category has reduced the average age of newly affluent investors from 55 to 47 over the past decade. Despite the growth in private banking and wealth management, one in five affluent investors remains suspicious of external wealth managers and prefers a DIY approach. Some are concerned about the quality of advice and high fees. More people are being persuaded, however, that the time saving alone can make it worth considering a professional wealth manager. Among the new clients of wealth managers are Alan Hunter, 61, and John Haddrell, 45, directors of thriving property rental business Midway in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. As their business grew rapidly along with their personal assets they decided to turn to advisory firm Edward Jones. Their Edward Jones investment representative Vik Sharma regularly visits them at their office and homes. Haddrell, who has a portfolio of more than Â£300,000, says he had previously spent up to seven hours a week managing his own investments. He decided to seek a wealth manager after realising he was spending too much time watching the stock markets and not enough running his business. â€œI was reticent at first to use an adviser because I was concerned about the quality of advice. But I realised that running a business makes life very busy and itâ€™s nice to know somebody is keeping an eye on your investments for you all the time,â€ he says. John Hutchinson, 62, a retired chief executive of a music copyright business, and his wife Elspeth, 60, from Essex, became clients of Lloyds TSB Private Banking last year. Lloyds manages their joint Â£400,000 portfolio and provides tax and trust advice including advice on their two French properties. Barclays Private Banking targets those with more than Â£500,000 but its Premier Banking Service caters for those earning over Â£100,000 or with Â£50,000-plus to invest. HSBC Private Banking offers worldwide offices and Royal Bank of Scotland has expanded its private banking service by acquiring Coutts and Adam & Company. Other private banks include C Hoare & Co, Butterfield Private Bank, Brown Shipley & Co and NM Rothschild & Sons. As the sector has become more competitive, many private banks have added services including independent financial advice, trust and taxation planning and family wealth transfer advice. All offer a personal â€œrelationshipâ€ manager who promises that you will always be a name, not a number. Private banks are not the only providers of wealth management services. There is a growing queue of specialist wealth managers and independent financial advisers targeting the Â£100,000- plus bracket. The Association of Private Client Investment Managers (Apcims) lists more than 200 member firms and the number is growing. Firms offering wealth management services include financial adviser John Scott & Partners, Close Bros, Tilney Investment Management, Killik & Co, and Brewin Dolphin. Andrew Fisher is the chief executive of financial planning business John Scott & Partners, an Apcims member. It has 12 offices, 165 planners and 200,000 clients in the UK. He is a former chief executive of Coutts. He believes that DIY clients in the newly affluent category in particular should give serious consideration to using a wealth manager not just to provide time-saving, professional management but also to provide an valuable external eye on their portfolios. He warns that like medicine, â€œself diagnosisâ€ can be damaging to your financial health. The costs of wealth management will depend on the type of wealth manager but it is worth remembering that the larger the portfolio the lower the annual management percentage fee should be and that fees can be negotiable. Annual charges for portfolio management typically range from 1-2 per cent and private banks will usually charge Â£10-Â£30 per month in bank account fees but will often waive this if large sums are invested.

Total factory orders rose by 3.1 percent in March, driven by a jump in demand for commercial aircraft and greater business investment in new equipment. But analysts expect the April growth rate to cool considerably to 0.7 percent, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Thomson Financial. Commerce said orders for big-ticket durable goods rose by 3.7 percent in March, and orders for nondurable goods like petroleum and chemicals, rose by 2.3 percent. Following a massive 5.7 percent drop in total orders in January and an increase of 1.4 percent in February, March's better-than-expected jump offered hope that demand was rising for manufacturers who have been hurt by slumping housing and auto sales. Despite the slower growth estimate for orders to U.S. factories in April, the sector received a boost on Friday when the Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index showed growth for the fourth month in a row in May and reached its highest level in a year. The index registered 55 compared with 54.7 in April, a figure it last hit in May 2006. A reading above 50 indicates growth while a reading below 50 indicates contraction. ISM reported new orders and production grew, and the top five performing industries were: nonmetallic mineral products; fabricated metal products; food, beverage and tobacco; chemical products; and petroleum and coal.

Overall factory orders rose 0.3 pct in April, while new orders excluding transportation related goods rose 0.7 pct. Economists had expected a 0.8 pct overall rise and a 0.9 pct gain excluding transportation. A decline in orders for non-durable goods was one factor for the lower-than expected rise, as orders and shipments of oil and gas fell due to a larger than normal number of refinery shutdowns. Commercial aircraft orders fell 10.7 pct, mostly on a decline in ) orders, while auto orders were down 3.3 pct. The weakness in the housing industry showed up in a 31.5 pct decline in orders for construction machinery. Overall non-defence capital goods orders fell 0.1 pct after rising 13.8 pct in March. So-called core capital goods orders, which excludes commercial aircraft and defence related goods, rose 2.1 pct in April. April factory shipments rose 0.8 pct, while inventories rose 0.5 pct.

While the Bancrofts, whose ancestors built Dow Jones into a leading publisher of financial news, appear to be capitulating to News Corp.'s $60-a-share offer to buy the company, there are signs that the two parties might have trouble finding common ground on setting up safeguards to ensure the editorial independence of Dow Jones' flagship property, The Wall Street Journal The Bancrofts initially expressed opposition to a sale to Murdoch's News Corp., whose media properties have a reputation for not upholding the journalistic standards upon which Dow Jones prides itself. But last Thursday, cracks appeared in that opposition, as the family expressed a willingness to discuss News Corp.'s offer as well as offers from any other buyers. Shares of Dow Jones reached a 52-week high of $61.49 Friday as investors bet that a new buyer could emerge -- but one hasn't yet. As well, Murdoch has signaled that he won't be sweetening his bid. The stock recently was down 80 cents to $60.40. As members of the Bancroft family meet with Murdoch and his son, James Murdoch, the parties will discuss the family's concerns about preserving the traditions of their flagship newspaper.

The move is an effort to restructure the business, according to Amp'd Mobile. Amp'd announced recently that it had almost 200,000 customers. "As a result of our rapid growth, our back-end infrastructure was unable to keep up with company demand," the company said in a statement. Amp'd is working with several unnamed investors to "obtain debtor-in-possession financing," the statement said. The company's executive team will remain "largely intact," Amp'd said. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Amp'd is more than $100 million in debt and has less than $100 million in assets. It owes Verizon Wireless about $33 million, its handset provider Motorola about $16 million, investor Vivendi SA about $10 million, and retailer Best Buy about $8 million, according to court documents. Earlier this year, Motorola released its Moto Q, Amp'd Edition covered several Amp'd handsets and services I'm saddened. Amp'd "gets" mobile content in a way that other carriers don't; its prices are refreshingly reasonable, and some of its programming is so good that it's made its way to big-screen TV! Hopefully the company will be able to reinvent itself as a content provider for Verizon, and transition users gently over to Verizon's network. (Verizon certainly needs the coherent content vision that Amp'd provides.) This news is also bad news for any other companies who want to go up against the big carriers with a high-end or content-focused product.

Lone Star agreed to pay $15.10 a share for Accredited, the companies said in a statement. The offer for San Diego-based Accredited is 9.7 percent more than the stock&#39;s closing price last week. Dallas-based Lone Star, which oversees $13.3 billion, often targets distressed real estate and finance companies. The stock tumbled as low as $3.77 in March as defaults on subprime mortgages, made to borrowers with poor payment histories, saddled Accredited with losses and spurred bankers to curtail credit for new home loans. Private-equity firms and hedge funds are buying subprime lenders including ResMae Mortgage Corp. at beaten-down prices and plan to sell when the market recovers. ``Now they have a parent that probably can get them funding through most crises,&#39;&#39; said Bose George, an analyst at KBW Inc. in New York who follows Accredited. ``Down the road they&#39;ll be able to make the decision whether they can compete alone or need to merge with some larger entity.&#39;&#39; The shares rose $1.36, or 9.9 percent, to $15.12 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. They traded as high as $15.44 on speculation a better bid might emerge. ``This agreement is the best alternative available to protect shareholder value,&#39;&#39; Chief Executive James Konrath said in the statement. ``In Lone Star, we have found a partner who has a record of helping companies like ours successfully address financial and operational challenges.&#39;&#39; Lone Star, founded in 1995 and run by John Grayken, has bought entire companies as well as non-performing loans and real estate, according to its Web site. The fund tries to take advantage of ``the tendency of the banking system to cyclically over-finance and then under-finance the property and other sectors.&#39;&#39; The firm has agreed to buy stakes in banks and lenders in South Korea, Japan and Germany, including a $429 million purchase of Japan&#39;s Korakuen Finance Co. announced in September. It also agreed last August to pay about $620 million for Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon Inc., a 260-restaurant chain based in Wichita, Kansas, with no previous tie to the investment company. Lone Star&#39;s $1.45 billion purchase in 2003 of a 50.5 percent stake in Korea Exchange Bank, South Korea&#39;s fifth-biggest bank, has ensnared the U.S. company in government probes. Prosecutors are investigating whether Lone Star deliberately understated the bank&#39;s financial strength before the purchase. Grayken, who has ascribed the charges to an ``anti-foreigner&#39;&#39; political climate, scrapped a plan last year to sell the bank for $6.8 billion to Kookmin Bank, the country&#39;s biggest lender. Accredited will be bought through Lone Star Fund V LP, which was formed in September 2004 and has $5 billion in capital commitments. Len Allen, president of Lone Star&#39;s U.S. operations, said in the statement that Accredited will now be able to ``manage through current industry dynamics.&#39;&#39; Rick Howe, an Accredited spokesman, didn&#39;t immediately return a call for comment. Ed Trissel, a spokesman for Lone Star, said executives weren&#39;t available. ``Of all the subprime lenders that were growing pretty quickly over the last few years, Accredited probably had the best reputation,&#39;&#39; said George at KBW. ``Given that this industry is going to continue in a much smaller form, these guys are probably a good management team to go with.&#39;&#39; Shares of rival mortgage lenders also rose today. NovaStar Financial Inc. added 5.6 percent, IndyMac Bancorp advanced 4.4 percent and Impac Mortgage Holdings Inc. gained 4.5 percent. Back From the Brink Accredited operates nationwide and ranked 14th last year among U.S. subprime lenders with $15.8 billion in loans and a 2.6 percent market share, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication. The lender had a market value of more than $1 billion a year ago before the subprime mortgage industry began to swoon. In March, the company said auditor Grant Thornton LLP wasn&#39;t sure Accredited would survive. Grant Thornton quit in April. The sale to Lone Star means Accredited will avoid the fate of rivals such as New Century Financial Corp., the biggest independent U.S. subprime home lender last year, which went bankrupt in April and now is being liquidated. At least 50 mortgage companies have halted operations, gone bankrupt or sought new owners since the start of 2006. Hedge funds have been among the buyers, with Citadel Investment Group planning to seek approval from a bankruptcy judge tomorrow for its $180 million acquisition of ResMae. Accredited had faced a cash crunch as creditors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch & Co. demanded it cover losses on mortgages that went sour. To help fend them off, Accredited got a $230 million five- year loan in April from the hedge fund Farallon Capital Management LLC and hired investment bankers at Bear Stearns Cos. to help explore ``strategic alternatives,&#39;&#39; including a sale. The loan accord guaranteed Farallon a $14 million payment if the debt was paid off within the first year. Farallon also got options to buy 3.23 million shares at $10 each, which may produce a gain of about $16.5 million. Farallon may not have fared so well on the 1.77 million shares it had accumulated as of March 10 at a cost of about $52.3 million, based on securities filings. The buyout values those shares at about $26.7 million. Mary Beth Grover, a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Farallon, declined to comment. Other investors included Thomas Brown&#39;s Second Curve Capital LLC, the largest shareholder with about 2.83 million shares as of April 24. Brown bought at least 2.15 million of those shares between Jan. 1 and Feb. 9, when the stock was trading above $25, based on filings. Brown didn&#39;t immediately respond to a call and e-mail message seeking comment. Accredited still hasn&#39;t filed its annual report with regulators and last month announced that its first-quarter filing also will be delayed. The company said May 11 it will report a ``significant loss&#39;&#39; in the first quarter because it issued about half as many mortgage loans compared with a year earlier. The company originated $1.9 billion in loans in the quarter, down 47 percent from the same period last year. The workforce was cut 31 percent to 2,900 in a bid to reduce costs, the company said last month. Accredited employed 3,164 people as of September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Wall Street clearly expects that most of them will agree to sell the company to the company that Murdoch controls. But could a family minority block such a sale? Under certain circumstances it is possible, because of the nature of the super-voting stock that Dow Jones has, for a family minority to obtain a veto when the rest of the family decides to sell. "Unlike some controlling shareholders, the Bancrofts cannot sell control," said Jeffrey Gordon, a professor at Columbia University Law School who has written extensively on dual class ownership of shares. "This raises the possibility that a minority of the family could block the sale." Under Dow Jones rules, Class B shares have 10 votes per share, while Class A shares, the ones traded on the New York Stock Exchange, have but one vote. But when Class B shares are sold, they become Class A shares, and lose their special voting rights. There are now more than 20 million Class B shares outstanding, 82 percent of them controlled by the Bancroft family and another 6 percent controlled by the Ottaway family, which has strongly opposed a sale to Murdoch. There are 63.7 million Class A shares. EU moving further on climate change A family minority could stand between Murdoch and the Wall Street Journal Shanghai stocks plunge, but other markets yawn The offer of $60 a share from News Corp. has triggered anguish among the family members and within the staff of The Wall Street Journal, because of concerns about how Murdoch might seek to influence the paper. [The union representing Dow Jones employees, which strongly opposes Murdoch&#039;s bid, said Monday that it had retained financial advisers to explore alternatives to selling to Murdoch, The Associated Press reported. The union, the Independent Association of Publishers&#039; Employees, said in a statement that it was working with a company called Ownership Associates of Cambridge, Massachusetts, to reach out to potential investors. Steve Yount, the president of the union, declined during an interview to say what potential investors were being approached.] The family initially said it rejected Murdoch&#039;s offer, but then agreed to meet with him Monday. The company&#039;s share price has risen above the $60 offer, reflecting the expectation that the family would get Murdoch to raise his offer and would then accept it. That could happen, but it appears that Murdoch could not simply make a tender offer. Buying some Class B shares would simply raise the relative voting power of the remaining Class B shares. At least theoretically, investors owning just 9.1 percent of the stock, or 7.6 million shares, could control the company if those were the only Class B shares left outstanding after the other shares were sold to Murdoch. Gordon conceded that it might be possible to structure a transaction as a merger, so that the Bancroft family members who backed the deal would maintain their voting rights when the deal was approved, despite disapproval from other family members. But, he added, "in that case, Murdoch probably wouldn&#039;t get shareholder agreements from family members to vote in favor of the merger, out of concern that such agreements could possibly trigger the conversion." That, he said, would add a lot of uncertainty while the deal was pending. The possible complications reflect the differing types of dual class ownership that have been adopted by companies where the founders or their successors wished to maintain control long after they had sold most of the economic ownership in the company. In some cases, among them that of News Corp. itself, the super-voting shares are freely transferable. Both classes trade, with the voting shares fetching a small premium to the non-voting shares. In some cases, that has led to treatment of public shareholders that has brought loud complaints. Donald Trump began his casino empire by purchasing control of the voting stock at Resorts International for a large price, with the nonvoting shares eventually selling for far less. Both classes had sold for similar amounts. At Dow Jones, as at some other companies, among them The New York Times Co. and The Washington Post, the super-voting shares cannot be sold to the public without losing their votes, although they can be inherited. That provision assures public investors that if the company is sold, all shareholders will be treated equally. But it means that a sale can be blocked by the super-voting holders if they wish to keep their stock. In the case of Dow Jones, the members of the Bancroft family are descendants of Clarence Barron, who bought the company in 1902. They did not establish the dual share system until 1986, when a stock split gave every shareholder one super-voting share for every two shares of ordinary stock, which became Class A stock.

Sabean, and it's time to go Better times bring worse traffic Accredited Home Lenders agrees to be sold for $400 million By ELLIOT SPAGAT AP Business Writer Article Launched: 06/04/2007 10:55:17 AM PDT SAN DIEGO- Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co., which makes mortgage loans to high-risk buyers, said Monday that it agreed to be acquired by a private-equity fund for about $400 million in cash. Lone Star Fund V LP will pay $15.10 per share for the company, a 10 percent premium over the stock's closing price of $13.76 on Friday. Accredited shares rose $1.58, or 11.6 percent, to $15.34 in early afternoon trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Still, the shares traded above $50 a year ago. "After a careful analysis, we believe this agreement is the best alternative available to protect shareholder value and provide the capital we need to support the company's business over the long-term," said Accredited Chief Executive James A. Konrath. "In Lone Star, we have found a partner who has a record of helping companies like ours successfully address financial and operational challenges." The offer is expected to close in the third quarter. Accredited, based in San Diego, competes in the subprime mortgage industry, which fell into turmoil earlier this year as payment defaults spiked and investors lost their appetite for risky home loans. In March, it received a $200 million loan from Farallon Capital Management LLC, a San Francisco-based money manager, following the sale of $2.7 billion of mortgage loans. Last month, it delayed filing its audited first-quarter report because it had a new auditor and forecast a "significant loss" for the quarter. Another subprime lender, New Century Financial Corp., sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April. The Irvine-based company had been the second-largest provider of home loans to high-risk borrowers, but it collapsed after a spike in mortgage defaults led its lenders to pull funding and demand that it buy back bad loans. Private investment firm Carrington Capital Management LLC and an affiliate won a bankruptcy auction of New Century's loan servicing business&mdash;its core asset&mdash;for $188 million.

Early Monday, the San Diego-based mortgage lender agreed to sell itself to Lone Star Fund V LP for $400 million, or $15.10 per share, cash. The deal values Accredit Home Lenders at a 9.7 percent premium to Friday's closing trade. ) fell victim this year to the turmoil sweeping through "subprime" mortgage lending, the area of banking catering to home buyers with patchy credit histories. As borrowers with bad credit began missing payments more frequently, subprime mortgage loans became harder to sell to investors and many of the banks' financial backers cut lenders off from borrowing more money. More than 30 subprime lenders have gone bankrupt this year amid an industrywide cash crunch. Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst Matthew Howlett wrote in a research report Lone Star provides Accredited with "a diversified funding base." The disarray in the sector is not because subprime mortgage lending will be permanently unprofitable, Howlett said. A lot of lenders simply ran out of cash during the downturn and had to sell their loans at a loss. "The business is inherently cyclical and the economics of the business are likely to rebound," he said. "Ultimately, we believe private-equity money realizes this and are capitalizing on the current stress in the marketplace to build capacity cheaply." While Lone Star is paying a premium to Accredited Home Lenders' stock from the previous trading day, the buyout price is a fraction of the stock's value before the industry collapsed. The shares topped $60 in May 2006 and ended last year at more than $27. The stock went from August 2003 until February 2007 without dipping below Lone Star's offer price. Howlett said Lone Star is acquiring Accredited Home Lenders at a discount to the total value of the lender's assets. Shares of many subprime mortgage lenders and financiers rose Monday even as the overall stock market fell. Shares of Accredited Home Lenders jumped $1.62, or 11.9 percent, to $15.39; shares of ) Inc. rose 34 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $7.80; and shares of ) rose 27 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $13.16.

Murdoch, the media mogul who owns News Corp., met with key members of the Bancroft family in person Monday to offer assurances The Wall Street Journal would continue its long tradition of excellence under his stewardship. The family had initially rebuffed Murdoch's $5 billion offer for the company in early May, but last Thursday they agreed to meet with him. The Journal reported Monday that the meeting would be held at the Bancrofts' law firm of Wachtel, Lipton in New York. Murdoch was seen entering the law firm's building early Monday afternoon. The Bancroft family controls 64 percent of the Dow Jones shareholder vote through a special class of shares, and can block any attempt to take over the company. In early May the family had said they had 52 percent of the shareholder vote lined up against Murdoch, but in recent weeks they have softened their position. Here's how some key newspaper publishers performed Monday: Dow Jones fell $1.04, or 1.7 percent, to $60.16. News Corp. slipped 12 cents to $24.10. New York Times Co. fell 7 cents to $26. Tribune Co. rose 8 cents to $32.24. McClatchy Co. dropped 31 cents, or 1.1 percent to $28.11. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In February, U.S. stocks tanked after Chinese shares hit the skids. Monday's gain reflected upbeat analyst recommendations about Wal-Mart Stores, which said it would boost its share purchases and scale back expansion plans, and a rally in oil-company stocks on the heels of high crude oil prices in futures trading. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 8.21 points, to 13,676.32. Wal-Mart was the biggest contributor to the gain. Alcoa was the biggest loser in the Dow. Broader markets indexes posted similarly modest gains, as winning stocks outnumbered losers by a less than 3-to-2 edge among New York Stock Exchange stocks. Treasury securities closed higher, but Monday's 8 percent drop in the Shanghai Stock Market composite index failed to generate a big flight to safety in Treasurys. Last Wednesday, Chinese stocks dropped 6.5 percent, but Wall Street ignored the news and scored the first record high on the Standard & Poor's 500 index in more than seven years.

Shares of Wal-Mart rose $1.74, or 3.5 percent, to end at $51.21, after at least four analysts upgraded the stock following the Little Rock, Ark.-based retailer's annual meeting Friday. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.21 points to finish at 13,676.32, with 13 stocks gaining ground, 17 declining and one flat. Shares of Home Depot Inc., the home improvement retailer, climbed for the fifth consecutive session, gaining 59 cents to end at $39.80. The Walt Disney Co. advanced 46 cents to $35.70 following a strong showing at the box office for its latest "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie for the second straight weekend. The stock may have also gotten a lift from an Appeals Court decision that questioned the constitutionality of the Federal Communications Commission's indecency rules.

Anderson Last Update: 4:20 PM ET Jun 4, 2007 (Updates paragraphs 1-7, focusing on the broad impact of the ruling; Adds details about the vote count in paragraphs 1 and 7; Add information about additional deliberations in the cases in paragraph 10.) WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The U.S. Supreme Court Monday made it harder for consumers to bring credit score lawsuits against the insurance industry, in a unanimous ruling favoring Safeco Insurance Co. of America, a unit of Safeco Inc. (SAFC) and Geico General Insurance Co., a unit of Berkshire Hathaway The justices said the insurance industry, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, must notify customers that it is charging higher insurance rates only when the higher rate is based on a low credit score. Companies aren't in violation of the law, the high court said, if the consideration of a credit score, as one of several considerations, didn't by alter the pricing. "Congress meant to require notice and prompt a challenge by the consumer only when the consumer would gain something if the challenge succeeded," Justice David Souter wrote in the court's opinion. The Supreme Court also said Safeco and Geico weren't reckless by not notifying customers about how their credit scores were used in insurance pricing decisions. Justice Souter's opinion added that Geico didn't violate the federal credit law and that Safeco "might have" but didn't do so recklessly. In a move creating a mixed outcome for the insurance industry, the high court stopped short of backing a higher standard of legal recklessness under the credit reporting law that the companies sought in the appeal. "There being no indication that Congress had something different in mind, we have no reason to deviate," Justice Souter wrote in applying a standard recklessness test. The Supreme Court ruling reverses opinions by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. While all nine justices supported most of the opinion, Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a concurring opinion arguing the opinion will lead to too few consumers getting notices about how their credit scores impact pricing decisions. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito filed a statement saying they support most of the ruling but saw no reason for the court to resolve factual questions in the Safeco case. Insurance companies have faced a wave of class-action lawsuits alleging they violated federal law by not telling consumers low credit scores resulted in higher quotes for insurance coverage. It's a common practice in the insurance industry to review credit scores and offer lower rates to customers with higher credit scores. Safeco and Geico were challenging a Ninth Circuit decision that said companies must tell consumers any time credit scores result in higher insurance rates. Companies face up to $1,000 in actual damages plus punitive damages for violation of the federal law. The cases are Safeco Insurance v. Burr, 06-84 and Geico General Insurance v. Edo, 06-100.

The sweetened offer of $62 per share tops the investor group's earlier bid of $60.50 per share, a deal that some of Laureate's major investors said was too low. A tender offer for Laureate's shares is scheduled to begin Friday. Baltimore-based Laureate, formerly known as Sylvan Learning Systems Inc., is a for-profit higher education company with 24 accredited institutions and 240,000 students in 15 countries. It includes online schools such as Walden University and universities in places such as Chile, Switzerland and China. Laureate's board unanimously accepted the latest offer, which represents a 26 percent premium over the company's closing stock price on Jan. 4, the day before a special committee of independent Laureate directors authorized advisers to start negotiations on a definitive acquisition. Shares of Laureate Education rose $1.52, or 2.53 percent, to $61.63 Monday. The investor group led by Chairman and CEO Douglas Becker includes Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Citi Private Equity, SAC Capital Management LLC, SPG Partners, Bregal Investments, Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, Sterling Capital, Makena Capital, Torreal SA and Brenthurst Funds. Becker and director R. Christopher Hoehn-Saric, along with certain other affiliates of Sterling Capital, have agreed to accept the original per share offer price in connection with the rollover of their shares in the transaction. The deal, however, could face problems from some of Laureate's larger shareholders. Three investors _ T. Rowe Price Group Inc., Select Equity Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. _ all expressed doubts about the earlier $60.50 per share offer. Laureate has forecast earnings of $5 per share by 2010, which T. Rowe Price said could send Laureate's share price to $110 over the next three years. The mutual fund company said in a March letter that it wanted Laureate to remain public so that shareholders could benefit from its "excellent long-term growth prospects." The three investors also said they were concerned about potential conflicts of interest, saying the deal put Becker in the position of trying to seek the lowest price as a buyer while ostensibly trying to maximize value for shareholders. T. Rowe Price, Select Equity and BlackRock did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the raised offer. Laureate also did not reply to a phone message. Trace Urdan, an analyst with the investment bank Signal Hill Capital Group, said the higher price likely got "one of the nay sayers to come on board." "Though I am sure they probably won't pull everyone on, they probably have successfully broken the anti-deal coalition," he said. The tender offer requires only a simple majority of 50 percent of the company's outstanding shares to approve the buyout. But if that threshold isn't met, Laureate can then include the stock options held by Becker and Hoehn-Saric to reach a majority. The tender offer is slated to last 20 business days. Becker has been CEO and chairman since 2000. Urdan described him as a "bright" executive and said the decision behind the buyout was likely in part a reflection of Becker's impatience with the constraints of running a public company. Going private will also help Laureate as it expands into developing _ and more volatile _ markets around the world, he said.

According to a statement from Amp'd Mobile, the company's infrastructure hasn't been able to keep up with customer demand, and the Chapter 11 filing is a way for the company to restructure its business, with the expectation it will resume normal business operations. The Wall Street Journal ( ) reports the company wasn't able to raise enough money to keep up on its debt payments. Amp'd Mobile operates as an MVNO&mdash;mobile virtual network operator&mdash;operating on Verizon's mobile network. The service has been operating for about a year and a half. Amp'd investors include MTV and Universal Music Group, and targets technologically-hip young consumers via music promotions, media-centric devices and services, and by sponsoring youth-oriented action-sports events. A bankruptcy filing will likely enable the company to shake much of its estimated $100 million in debt (including substantial sums owed to Verizon and Motorola), but will also likely consume ownership stakes and preferred stock owned by investors and key executives. Amp'd describes its top management team as remaining "largely intact;" reports in recent weeks have pointed to a possible rift between CEO Peter Adderton and Amp'd's directors; the company has also had issues with COO Susan Swenson, who's move to Amp'd from T-Mobile was delayed in 2005 by a judicial ruling which found she'd violated a non-compete clause with her former employer, T-Mobile. Amp'd says it is working with one of its largest investors to obtain debtor-in-possession financing.

YouTube said on Sunday that it has signed a deal with Hearst-Argyle Television, and that it will carry news, weather and entertainment video content from five of the company's TV stations. Hearst-Argyle has 29 stations, including outlets in Boston, New Hampshire, Sacramento, Pittsburgh and Baltimore. They are affiliates of ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox. Hearst has about an 18 per cent share of the U.S. market, according to the company. In addition to news and weather, YouTube is also going to carry some of the network's newer digital video content, including footage of high-school football and basketball games, as well as local amateur entertainment, the companies said in a statement. The video-sharing site, which is currently fighting lawsuits over misappropriated content from Viacom and other groups, has said that it plans to sign other revenue-sharing deals with content owners -- including individuals -- who allow their videos to be shown on YouTube.

(XTO.N) for about $6.5 billion as part of its plan to focus on its power business. The sale, which brings Dominion closer to completing its plan to sell most of its exploration and production assets, raised less than expected, according to analysts. Including earlier sales, Dominion has agreed to sell $11.84 billion in exploration and production properties this year. Resources for anyone who runs a small business or wants to start one.

XTO, a natural gas producer, will pay about $2.5 billion for the operations in the Rocky Mountains and South Texas region, including the Gulf Coast, San Juan Basin and Louisiana. XTO said it may include them in a master limited partnership that gives the company tax advantages. XTO also raised its production growth forecast to 15 percent from 10 percent. XTO's shares rose more than 5 percent, while Dominion shares rose less than 1 percent. "The price looks to be be disappointing, at least relative to our expectations," said Nathan Judge, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. "Having said that, it looks like they are going to be buying back more stock than they had originally committed to as a percent of total proceeds and their expenses are lower," Judge said. Other Dominion exploration and production sales this year included its Gulf of Mexico properties, which it agreed to sell to ENI Plc (ENI.L) for $4.76 billion, and its Canadian property, which it plans to sell for $583 million to a Canadian energy trust. The remaining properties earmarked for sale, largely in Oklahoma, will be sold in a new process starting in July, Dominion said. Atlantic's Judge said the Oklahoma assets may fetch $1.7 billion, which would bring the total sales up to about $13.5 billion. While Dominion did not disclose the target sales price, sources close to the situation told Reuters earlier this year it had been seeking to raise about $15 billion overall. Monday's sale of onshore assets, which includes 3.51 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas and oil reserve as of December 31 and is expected to close in August, was less than foreseen, said Neil Bigman, a Dahlman Rose analyst specializing in gas assets. "(Onshore was) a little bit lighter than I would like to see, but the offshore was higher than expected," he added, referring to the Gulf of Mexico sale. Daniele Seitz, an analyst at Dahlman Rose who has a buy rating on Dominion and owns no shares, said it was "a little disappointing as we were expecting the company to do better at monetizing these assets," but that the company's restructuring is positive and the move should help earnings. Dominion forecast 2008 operating earnings of $6 or more per share and future growth of 4 percent to 6 percent per share as it operates as a more pure-play power company. As previously announced, Dominion intends to maintain its gas operations in the Appalachian. The company has 26,500 megawatts of power generation and operates a utility in Virginia. The Richmond, Virginia-based company said it had earmarked the asset sale proceeds for about $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion in debt reduction, with the remainder planned for the repurchase of common stock. Shares in XTO rose $3.32, or 5.7 percent, to $61.69, while Loews rose 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $51.28. Dominion rose 38 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $88.02.

http://www.forbes.com/markets/2007/06/04/partygaming-doj-gambling-markets-equity-cx_po_0604markets07.html&cid PartyGaming Wants A Clean Slate - Forbes.com PartyGaming Wants A Clean Slate 06.04.07, 12:05 PM ET , one of the world's biggest online gambling companies, have been on a high-stakes and generally unpleasant journey over the past nine months. Last October the company's shares crashed 57% after the U.S. Congress outlawing online gambling, snuffing out around two thirds of its revenue. The company has been limping back towards profitability ever since, and now it's also seeking a clean slate with U.S. authorities On Monday PartyGaming announced it was in talks with the United States Attorney&#146;s Office for the Southern District of New York, a representative of the Department of Justice, in what appears to be an attempt to clarify its legal position before the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act was passed in October 2006. If the company reaches some sort of understanding with the DOJ, not only will its executives be allowed to visit the United States without fear of prosecution, (See: "Trouble In The Cards" ), it should also inject some stability into its shares. ) said it initiated the talks with the DOJ, because US law enforcement agencies had taken action on other online gambling firms who had taken bets from American customers before the new bill, and it was now responding to a request for information. "Bottom line is they're trying to eliminate any cloud that's hanging over their heads," said Joseph Kelly, a business law professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo who has worked with online gambling companies. "They want to be able tell their shareholders that there are no threats of impending prosecution." Kelly said that U.S. attorneys had sent out subpoenas and questions to online gambling firms in recent months. A compromise with PartyGaming would likely take the form of an agreement, rather than a financial settlement, and if the company reaches an understanding with the New York Attorney's Office, it won't face action from other prosecutors. Discussions with the DOJ is "the most sensible route for operators that used to offer their services into the US, essentially working with the authorities to hopefully draw a line under any potential ongoing litigation," said James Hollins, an analyst at broker Daniel Stewart, who has a "hold" recommendation and 38 pence (76 cents) price target on the stock. Like its other publicly traded rival, 888 Holdings, Gibraltar-based PartyGaming is loathe to gamble on legal matters. In April the company announced it would no longer allow Turkish citizens to place bets on any of its Web sites, even though the government had only outlawed unauthorized online gambling firms from taking bets. "They can't afford to take any chances," said Kelly. Shares in PartyGaming were down 0.50 pence, or 1.2%, at 41 pence (82 cents) on Monday afternoon in London. The shares have only recovered by around 20 pence (40 cents) since their October plummet. Just prior to the bill being passed they had hovered for about a year around the 100 pence ($1.99) mark.

Following their breakthrough agreement with EMI, has signed a deal with . Under the pact, Hearst-Argyle stations will receive a licensing fee whenever content from member stations is viewed on YouTube. It represents the first such deal involving local TV stations, and shows the way YouTube is being viewed by the media. Hearst-Argyle is a major player in the local television market, owing 29 stations across the U.S., and reaching almost 20% of American households. Its stations are associated with all three of the major networks. Company stations from Boston, Sacramento, Pittsburgh and elsewhere will begin posting content on YouTube to dedicated channels on YouTube. &ldquo;We'd been looking for a way to expand our footprint online and rapidly expand into new markets,&rdquo; said Terry Mackin of Hearst-Argyle. &ldquo;With this deal, we're really trying to say this station group is not your father's Oldsmobile.&rdquo; YouTube and Hearst-Argyle will split revenue from the content, but the percentages haven&rsquo;t been disclosed, and the two companies have yet to decide when ads will be aired within the content. It&rsquo;s a major step as an old media force signs up to new media, and a sign that YouTube is eager to play ball with established media companies to increase its content.

Accredited Home Lenders ( ) said it had agreed to merge with Lone Star Fund V (U.S.) LP , through its affiliate Lone Star U.S. Acquisitions, LLC, in an all-cash transaction under which Lone Star will buy all of Accredited's common stock for $15.10 per share, or a total price tag of roughly $400 million. The Preferred shares isued by its subsidiary, Accredited Mortgage Loan REIT Trust, aren't covered by the merger agreement and will remain outstanding. Accredited and other smaller subprimers may see the writing on the wall. "Given how difficult the [subprime] market is, it makes sense for small players to merge in order to survive," said Bose George, an analyst who covers the company for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Given that Accredited Home's management team has never come under fire, Lone Star is likely to stay out of the way and "let [Accredited] do their thing," he added. Accredited Home's common shares were trading 11.5% higher at $15.34 on June 4. Lone Star spokesman Ed Trissel said he couldn't comment on Lone Star's plans for the business. With NovaStar Financial ( ) also looking for a buyer, the monoline subprime business is over, Bose said. Another subprime lender, Delta Financial ( ), is likely to survive only because its mortgage loans were made at a fixed rate and won't push borrowers into default as certain adjustable-rate loans have as interest rates have climbed, he added. Besides giving it easier access to capital, merging with Lone Star will also eliminate the threat of having its common stock delisted by the Nasdaq Stock Exchange for failing to meet a deadline for filing its annual report for 2006. Strapped for cash, Accredited Home had been shopping around for a buyer for months, George said. In March, the company was forced to sell virtually its entire loan inventory at a deep discount. In a research note on March 27, Bear Stearns & Co. estimated the $2.7 billion portfolio was sold at 7% of the par value in order to limit the company's exposure to additional margin calls and free up about $50 million in capital that had been tied up as collateral for the loans. The company's liquidity seemed to improve in April after it secured a $230 million financing facility from Farallon Capital Management and a $500 million credit facility from an unnamed commercial bank and renewed an existing $600 million credit line. Accredited Home ended the first quarter with $320 million in cash, funding capability of at least $1.1 billion and elimination of most of the margin call risk associated with its loan inventory, said in a research note on April 3. By George's calculation, Lone Star is paying about 85% of Accredited Home's book value. Although his estimate is rough without access to filings that would have showed Accredited Home's profits or loss for 2006 and the first quarter of 2007, Lone Star presumably saw the book before making a bid, George said. "That's not a bad price, because of all the uncertainty in the market that's going to continue for a significant period of time," said George, who doesn't expect a rebound in the subprime market for another 12 to 18 months. The company delayed filing an annual report for 2006 to allow time to re-examine any goodwill it booked in association with its acquisition of Aames Investment Corp., which closed in October. During that process, its independent auditors, Grant Thorton LLP, resigned without completing a review of the company's 2006 financial results. The goodwill is probably worth nothing after the collapse of the subprime lending market, George said. For Lone Star, the merger is probably a better alternative than having to create a mortgage lending business from scratch, as long as the price isn't too high, said Stuart Plesser, an analyst who covers mortgage lenders for Standard & Poor's. (S&P, like BusinessWeek.com, is a unit of The McGraw-Hill Cos. [ "People believe the subprime market is going to be a lucrative business down the road and are getting their ducks in a row," he said. The key to survival for the smaller subprime lenders is the source of their funding. The lenders that got into trouble were relying on so-called warehouse loans &#8211; those that come from large investment banks --which were shut off when the bottom fell out of the subprime market, Plesser said. Only lenders that have a significant portion of their funding from deposits, such as Countrywide Financial ( ) or Wells Fargo ( ) can afford to stay in game, he added. George doesn't own Accredited shares but Keefe, Bruyette & Woods does and tries to do investment banking with the companies it covers.

http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/06/04/ap3786508.html&cid Laureate Education OK's Raised $3.8B Bid - Forbes.com Laureate Education OK's Raised $3.8B Bid 06.04.07, 4:44 PM ET Laureate Education Inc. said Monday that it has agreed to go private for $3.82 billion in cash from a group led by the higher education company's chairman and chief executive officer. The sweetened offer of $62 per share tops the investor group's earlier bid of $60.50 per share, a deal that some of Laureate's major investors said was too low. A tender offer for Laureate's shares is scheduled to begin Friday. Baltimore-based Laureate, formerly known as Sylvan Learning Systems Inc., is a for-profit higher education company with 24 accredited institutions and 240,000 students in 15 countries. It includes online schools such as Walden University and universities in places such as Chile, Switzerland and China. Laureate's board unanimously accepted the latest offer, which represents a 26 percent premium over the company's closing stock price on Jan. 4, the day before a special committee of independent Laureate directors authorized advisers to start negotiations on a definitive acquisition. Shares of Laureate Education rose $1.52, or 2.53 percent, to $61.63 Monday. The investor group led by Chairman and CEO Douglas Becker includes Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Citi Private Equity, SAC Capital Management LLC, SPG Partners, Bregal Investments, Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, Sterling Capital, Makena Capital, Torreal SA and Brenthurst Funds. Becker and director R. Christopher Hoehn-Saric, along with certain other affiliates of Sterling Capital, have agreed to accept the original per share offer price in connection with the rollover of their shares in the transaction. The deal, however, could face problems from some of Laureate's larger shareholders. Three investors - T. Rowe Price Group Inc., Select Equity Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. - all expressed doubts about the earlier $60.50 per share offer. Laureate has forecast earnings of $5 per share by 2010, which T. Rowe Price said could send Laureate's share price to $110 over the next three years. The mutual fund company said in a March letter that it wanted Laureate to remain public so that shareholders could benefit from its "excellent long-term growth prospects." The three investors also said they were concerned about potential conflicts of interest, saying the deal put Becker in the position of trying to seek the lowest price as a buyer while ostensibly trying to maximize value for shareholders. T. Rowe Price, Select Equity and BlackRock did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the raised offer. Laureate also did not reply to a phone message. Trace Urdan, an analyst with the investment bank Signal Hill Capital Group, said the higher price likely got "one of the nay sayers to come on board." "Though I am sure they probably won't pull everyone on, they probably have successfully broken the anti-deal coalition," he said. The tender offer requires only a simple majority of 50 percent of the company's outstanding shares to approve the buyout. But if that threshold isn't met, Laureate can then include the stock options held by Becker and Hoehn-Saric to reach a majority. The tender offer is slated to last 20 business days. Becker has been CEO and chairman since 2000. Urdan described him as a "bright" executive and said the decision behind the buyout was likely in part a reflection of Becker's impatience with the constraints of running a public company. Going private will also help Laureate as it expands into developing - and more volatile - markets around the world, he said. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Cuomo said an investigation found that in some parts of the state consumers might not have been getting the best prices they could on some prescriptions because Rite Aid ) and Eckerd stores were often the only chain drug stores available for cash payments. For example, Cuomo said the price of Allegra D, a common allergy drug, was $96.50 at Kinney, $120.95 at Medicine Shoppe, $129.99 at Rite Aid, and $131.99 at Walgreens. "An effective way to restore competition and help keep rising prescription drug prices down is to empower consumers to shop for the best price for needed medicines," said Cuomo in a statement released Monday. Under the separate deal announced Monday, Rite Aid will also purchase six distribution centers. As a result of the acquisitions, Rite Aid will operate about 5,160 stores in 31 states and Washington, D.C. The Harrisburg, Pa.-based retailer announced in August that it would purchase the stores from its Canadian parent, , triggering the multistate investigation led by Cuomo and involving Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Virginia. Cuomo's office maintains a prescription drug price comparison Web site that enables consumers to search and find the lowest price for needed medications. Copyright 2007 Associated Press.

But Trump did not appear and will not be called as a witness for Black, one of the media baron's lawyers confirmed Monday during a lunch break. The attorney declined to explain why Trump will not appear. Trump and Black had a business relationship. Trump had bought the Chicago Sun-Times building from Hollinger International Inc. for a land-development project.

The new Yahoo Search Marketing Commercial API Program gives businesses and individual developers access to a series of APIs (application program interfaces) so they can modify the Panama platform to suit their needs. The program offers three levels of partnership, ranging from a free Basic deal for small advertising agencies and technology companies, to Advanced and Elite levels with varying subscription rates. All participants have access to technical support, while advanced partners receive account management support and a listing in Yahoo's partner directory. Elite partners, according to a Yahoo statement, can "leverage the Panama platform, resources and brand via regular business review, product council, road map coordination and joint marketing activities." Early participants in the Elite tier include Efficient Frontier, Omniture, SearchIgnite and The Search Agency. Yahoo launched Panama earlier this year to compete with Google, which pocketed about 25 percent of all online ad dollars in 2006. Yahoo garnered about 18 percent. Panama's ad ranking system, which surfaces sponsored search results based on click rate in addition to how much advertisers pay, is an improvement from Yahoo's prior system, which surfaced ads based solely on price paid in auction. Panama also allows advertisers to target ads geographically. Panama's biggest success to date was a deal with Viacom to provide sponsored search and contextual ads to 33 of its entertainment sites.

Energy was the S&P 500's top-gaining sector as oil surged above $70 on news that a cyclone was headed towards the oil-producing Arabian peninsula with a potential to disrupt shipping and output. Shares of Chevron Corp. rose 1.1 percent to $83.12. A man checks stock information in front of an electronic board at a stock exchange in Nanjing, east China's Jiangsu province June 4, 2007. REUTERS/Sean Yong Email to a friend China's domestic stock market fell 8 percent, its fourth straight losing session, following last week's hike in the tax on stock trades. Nevertheless, markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul ended higher, and European markets were only slightly lower on Monday. U.S. stocks initially fell in early morning trading, but clawed their way back. Among decliners, airline stocks fell on worries about weak revenues. Continental Airlines shares fell 5.5 percent after the company reported lower revenues per passenger in May, an early sign of weakness going into the key summer travel season. "The main story today is energy," said Scott Vergin, portfolio manager at Thrivent Financial in Minneapolis. "On the negative side, you've got airlines, which are weak on worries about traffic numbers. But apart from these stories, the market is quite lackadaisical. People really don't seem that concerned about China." The Dow Jones industrial average was down 15.52 points, or 0.11 percent, at 13,652.59. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 0.35 of a point, or 0.02 percent, at 1,536.69. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 1.42 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,612.60. , currently seen as a better gauge of the global market than U.S. oil, was up $1.36 cent at $70.41 a barrel. General Electric & Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. were among the top advancers in the Dow and the S&P 500, which helped support the broad market. General Electric rose 0.8 percent to $37.76, after Barron's, the weekly financial newspaper, reported that the conglomerate may face pressure to spin off some units. Wal-Mart rose 2.8 percent to $50.86 after several brokerages raised their ratings on shares of the world's biggest retailer, citing the company's plans to curb its U.S. store growth and a $15 billion share-buyback announcement. A string of takeover news, including a buyout of struggling subprime mortgage lender Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. , also lent support to the market. Shares of contract electronics maker Solectron Corp. shot up 14.5 percent to $3.86 on the New York Stock Exchange on a takeover bid by rival Flextronics International Ltd. Shares of Accredited Home Lenders surged 10.6 percent to $15.22 in Nasdaq trading after it agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Lone Star for $400 million.

Gadgets. Tech. Digital Stuff for the Rest of Us. Make AOL My Homepage Amp'd Files for Bankruptcy Protection Posted Jun 4th 2007 4:39PM by Well, it looks like is having a little trouble doing what businesses are supposed to do -- namely, make money. Earlier today, the youth-oriented MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. MVNOs are essentially boutique mobile operators that use the networks of the large and established carriers, but offer distinct content, handsets, and calling plans. So even though Amp'd may look like a completely different carrier, it actually uses Verizon's network. Other examples of MVNOs include (which uses Sprint's networks), (uses AT&T/Cingular's network), and Amp'd owes $33 million to Verizon and $16 million to Motorola (which makes its handsets), among other debts. In total Amp'd is about $100 million in the hole, which is more than its total assets. As is the case with many companies that file for Chapter 11, Amp'd is not down completely, it's just buying time. If you have an Amp'd Mobile phone, rest easy -- your service isn't going anywhere, for now. Amp'd's stumbling is just the latest case of a much-hyped MVNO going bust (last year, ESPN Mobile closed down, only to be reborn as a service on Verizon Wireless handsets Amp'd will begin to reorganize in hopes turning a profit -- or at least being able to pay its bills -- but the niche appeal of most MNVOs is proving not to be the best business model on earth. We like MVNOs, since they're like indie, customer-driven alternatives to the big behemoth major carriers, so we're keeping our fingers crossed for Helio and Virgin Mobile, among the few left that so far are at least keeping up appearances of solvency.

This Week in Weddings Wedding of the Week Planning Ideas & Advice This Week from CareerJournal.com Interview Like a Pro Rite-Aid Buys Eckerd Drugs Monday, June 4, 4:26 p.m. The Rite-Aid Drug Store chain announced Monday it closed a deal to acquire almost 300 Eckerd Drug Stores in Pennsylvania. It is part of a $3.9 billion acquisition that makes Rite-Aid the biggest drug store chain on the east coast. Rite-aid said customers will begin seeing changes soon at Eckerd Drug stores. All the stores will be remodeled and will take on the Rite-Aid name within 16 months. The first Rite-Aid store opened 45 years ago along North Washington Avenue in Scranton. Shopper Paul Kamor admitted he&#39;s a Rite-Aid fan. "I like the rebates. Matter of fact, I have one right here!" he said. With the acquisition, Rite-Aid expands to more than 5,000 stores nationwide. Financial consultant Lou Ingargiola thinks the company is now poised to compete with the big boys in the drug store business, Walgreen&#39;s and CVS. "If you are small, you will not survive. You need big, and big is working in every industry," Ingargiola said. Andrew Brown&#39;s Pharmacy on Scranton&#39;s south side is one of a handful of independently owned drug stores still around. After 96 years in business the owners are confident they know how to keep their customers. "Our feeling is they&#39;re better to have the personalized service that the community pharmacies can give them," said Mike Brown of Andrew Brown&#39;s Pharmacy. He added these days mail-order drug companies are a bigger threat to his business than the big chains. As for the big getting bigger in the drug store world Rite-Aid shopper Kamor is unconcerned. "If it&#39;s efficient and it brings better service and prices to the customer, then it&#39;s probably worth it," Kamor said. There is nothing in Rite-Aid&#39;s announcement to indicate there are thoughts about closing any of the just-acquired Eckerd stores. A Rite-Aid spokeswoman was looking into whether any closures could be expected. More from Newswatch 16 . . .

Sabean, and it's time to go Better times bring worse traffic Southwest jet skids after landing gear collapses in Oakland Article Launched: 06/04/2007 10:25:19 AM PDT OAKLAND, Calif.- The main runway at Oakland International Airport reopened Monday morning, a day after a Southwest Airlines jet skidded to a halt when its front landing gear collapsed during touchdown. None of the 119 passengers or crew were injured in the incident, which blocked plane traffic for hours, airport officials said. Southwest Flight 3050 took off from Sacramento and was en route to San Diego on Sunday afternoon when cockpit instruments indicated possible problems with the Boeing 737's landing gear. The pilot was diverted to Oakland to land, where air traffic controllers saw during a flyby that the plane's rear landing gear was cocked to the side, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said. The plane retracted and lowered its landing gear again, and a second flyby of the tower showed all three pieces&mdash;one under the nose and one under each wing&mdash;appeared to be correctly in place, Gregor said. After the pilots cycled the landing gear one more time, a visual inspection showed no problems, and three green lights in the cockpit indicated the gear was operating properly. But after landing, the gear at the plane's nose collapsed and the plane skidded down the runway. "Unfortunately, the back landing gear landed just fine, but the nose gear went up inside the aircraft and retracted," airport spokeswoman Cyndy Johnson said. All passengers were evacuated to the terminal, and most were put on other flights home, Johnson said. The plane was removed from the runway late Sunday night and the runway reopened around 5:45 a.m. Monday morning, as FAA officials and Southwest maintenance crews continued to investigate the cause of the collapse. Delays at Oakland International as a result of the incident were light as controllers diverted other flights to alternate runways, Johnson said.

The statistics were part of an overall 1.3 percent rise in violent crime across the country in 2006 - the second straight annual increase. However, car thefts, arsons and other property crimes dipped for the second straight year, the data show. The modest increase in murders reflected a mixed bag for cities. The number of homicides in major metropolitan areas - those with at least 1 million residents - climbed by 6.7 percent. Smaller cities, meanwhile, saw their murders decrease by a collective 11.9 percent. The spike in robberies marked the highest increase in any category of crime surveyed in the FBI report, which was compiled with data from more than 11,700 law enforcement agencies nationwide. Violent crime rose in every region of the country except for the Northeast, the FBI reported. Western states saw the largest jump in violent crime, by 2.8 percent, the data show. The new numbers come amid a Justice Department push to tamp down violent crime with millions of new dollars in funds to local police and a surge of federal agents to troubled cities. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales - who took office as violent crime started to rise - has called the crackdown one of his top priorities for the remaining 18 months of his tenure at the Justice Department. In a spot of good news, violent crime grew at a slower pace than initially expected. In December, the FBI projected a 3.7 percent increase for the first six months of 2006. The year before, in 2005, violent crime rose by 2.3 percent. Property crimes decreased overall by 2.9 percent from 2005, the FBI reported. Burglaries, however, rose slightly - particularly in mid-sized cities, where the rate grew by 3.3 percent.

Through the new Search Marketing Commercial API Program, businesses and developers can build products based on Yahoo's core technology for serving up advertisements based on search relevancy and advertiser payments. Dan Boberg, Yahoo's managing director of sales technology, said that the company completely rebuilt the Panama APIs with an eye toward providing the scalability and reliability needed to build search marketing businesses. "We're trying to take the program and industry to a new level by providing these commercial value-added services by opening up access more broadly," he said. "We've left the stage where businesses in the search marketing space can afford to get by with whatever service is available. There's a gap in the industry where most search providers are not stepping up to provide robust enterprise-class services." The new API program provides three levels of access to the Panama application programming interfaces: Basic, designed for small companies, provides free access to Panama and technical support. Advanced, which provides access to the Panama platform, dedicated technical support and service-level agreements. Elite, which provides access to Panama and to joint marketing opportunities with Yahoo and enables participants to make contributions to the product's road map.

YouTube, a unit of Google, and Hearst-Argyle said in a statement Sunday that they would share advertising revenue on news, weather and entertainment videos from five TV stations - the first time YouTube has paid for local TV programming. Hearst-Argyle television stations in Boston, Sacramento, Pittsburgh. Baltimore and Manchester, New Hampshire, will begin posting local video content to dedicated channels on YouTube. YouTube will also distribute Hearst-Argyle&#039;s new digital video initiatives, including high school football, basketball and local amateur entertainment, the companies said. Hearst-Argyle, which owns 29 local TV stations in the United States, will take an undisclosed cut of the advertising revenue YouTube earns when its users view clips, a spokesman said.

The two private equity firms appear to have bested a rival bid from and a deal may be announced as early as today, those people said. But they cautioned that the talks were ongoing and that Nortel could field a higher 11th-hour bid. The firms are expected to pay about $17 per share, the people said. Avaya’s shares closed Friday at $16.08. Speculation about a buyout first arose two weeks ago, when the company unexpectedly postponed a meeting with analysts without offering an explanation or setting a new date. An Avaya spokeswoman would not comment. Avaya, which was once a division of Lucent Technologies and before that, is one of the nation’s top makers of phone equipment, rivaling in providing Internet-based communications to corporations. Much of its business focuses on upgrading companies to voice networks that can also offer video and data services. Avaya draws almost a third of its revenue from its long-term maintenance contracts, though the company has warned that as those agreements expire, its customers have the leverage to demand lower fees. The company, which was spun off from Lucent in October 2000, suffered in 2002 as the dot-com bubble burst. But its financial health has rebounded so strongly that a analyst recently described Avaya as an ideal buyout candidate. In its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2006, the company reported net profit of $201 million on revenue of $5.12 billion, and it is virtually debt-free. The company, based in Basking Ridge, N.J., has about 20,000 employees. The move comes amid heavy deal-making in the telecommunications sector. Last month, , the wireless service provider, agreed to a $27.5 billion buyout by Texas Pacific and a unit of Analysts have predicted consolidation in the telecommunications equipment sector. Mergers among phone companies have amplified their size and purchasing power, while low-cost Asian companies have squeezed the profits of their Western counterparts. Last year, Alcatel and Lucent agreed to merge in an $11.6 billion deal, which many analysts say forced players like Avaya and Nortel to ally to stay competitive. Some analysts had seen an Avaya-Nortel pairing as a good fit. But the companies’ overlap in product offerings make integration difficult, analysts said.

The court ruled that Geico, the insurance unit of Warren Buffett's , did not violate the law, and that while , a Seattle-based auto and home insurer, might have, it did not act recklessly. The companies had been sued by customers who said the insurers did not give them the best insurance rates, based on information in their credit reports, and did not notify them, as required by the law. Justice David Souter said in the court's unanimous opinion that willful failure covers a violation of the law committed in reckless disregard of the notice obligation. He also said that initial rates charged for new insurance policies may be adverse actions under the law. A U.S. appeals court in California had ruled that consumers do not have to prove knowledge on the part of the insurers, but need only show the companies acted with "reckless disregard" for the law's requirements. Although the Supreme Court said the appeals court correctly held that reckless disregard of the law would qualify as a willful violation, Souter said there was no need for the appeals court to send the cases back to a federal judge for factual development. That is because GEICO's decision was not a violation of the law, and Safeco's misreading the law was not reckless, Souter wrote. The Supreme Court reversed the appeals court's ruling and sent the cases back for further proceedings. Copyright 2007 Reuters Limited. All rights reserved.

The Uniform Crime Report to be released Monday says the number of violent crimes was up 1.3 percent last year, after a 2.3 percent rise in 2005, The Washington Post reported Saturday. That was the first significant increase since 1990. "After years of driving crime rates down, we are now in reverse gear," said Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., who chairs a crime subcommittee. "It's time to get back to crime-fighting basics -- that means more cops on the streets, equipped with the tools and resources they need to keep our neighborhoods safe." Experts were unsure about the reasons for the rise, which was sharpest in medium-sized cities. They said there may be more teenagers in the population or inmates released from prison. Gang violence has also spread to many smaller cities.

WHERE DO YOU THINK THESE GANGS COME FROM???? CLUE--It isn't the north Where do you think the gang colors blue and red came from???? Look at the areas---Miami--highest in Hispanic and illegal population in fl--- Wake up people--this is due to illegal aliens coming across the border and the gangs are from Mexico Jun 4th, 2007 - 14:35:10 Geeeeeeee...Let me think,,I remember a time when we had good paying jobs in this country and I remember when the kids in the shipyards were to tired to spend their checks....Now all the good paying jobs are gone and the working class are turning into slaves....Look what happened in a Ohio town when a car manufacture pulled out, the crime sored overnight and is still going up.....Your hard earned tax money is still going to fund companies to move out of the US......More foreign workers will be coming in, you can thank the re-run Clinton for her siding with Silicon Valley to allow this to happen if she becomes the next Ptesident and we still can't stop the flow of illegals coming in, because the fence never was built on the mexican border, the Demos cut the budget, there is a law to build it... O' thank Regan for the 16th street gang. He allowed them to come in to the US for helping with the war in Central America. Geeeeee, he also did this to the foreigners that first tried to take out the Trade Center, they helped get the Russians out of Afghanistan, but they wanted Green Cards to fight the Russians, they got their green cards and we got a few dead at the first try to take out the T/center. Now Coke Head Bush is going to allow un-inspected Mexican truckers all over the US, putting more US trucking companies out of business and forcing down the wages, and the drugs will be coming in unchecked....Lets not forget a few China officials that gave a bunch of assault weapons to the gangs of Los Angeles a few years ago, that was covered up.....Lets not forget how the South Vietnam Government sold dope to the American troops to keep its budget going while all that money ended up in off-shore accounts after the war, while all the top brass of the US military turned their backs on its own troops, now we have vets strung out in all the VA Hospitals........The list goes on.. Jun 4th, 2007 - 16:33:15 Well Old School ,if I understand your writing correctly the whole world is to blame for your raising crime rate .As far as Americans are to blame ,the responsibility resides with the Clintons ? Slightly out of touch with reality,are you ? Jun 4th, 2007 - 18:50:12 If they can't manage to blame Europe for their crime waves and gun ridden violent society, they'll probably try to blame people believing in global warming, or Putin and his missiles, or Muslims or... well anything really, so long as they done have to face up to the truth and take a look at their own society. In fact, they'll probably blame me for posting this message - although it will probably consist of the usual bone-headed personal remarks and name calling which one associates with 10 year olds in the school playground. SP4: Old, Old School Jun 4th, 2007 - 21:02:01 Tonny suffers from not living here, or he's ignorant, or both. At least one of these reasons is not his fault. Employment is through the roof in the USA. Houseold wealth is at historic highs. If you can't get a job, you are either illiterate, a convict, on a drug, or a psycho. Any able bodied American can find work. If you will invest in a skill, taught at cut rate community colleges across the nation, you will double your income. Did the libnazis screw you? Get in line: 15,000 mill jobs in Oregon alone. Loss of the aluminum industry, etc. Yes, the Libs backed the enviroradicals and this is the result. You don't like it, pick a number. The Clintons? In fact, they are the one's that greenlighted NAFTA, GATT, WTO, MFN for China (and the chinese campaign funds were for what?). They passed every proposal Bush one lined up. They greenlighted avery oil merger in the 90's. They pimped themselves via Sandy Berg(L)ar to every oil company they could find. They dismantled the CIA. They are free traders, end of story. Now, Hillary wants you to believe that she is not. The paradox: Free trade is a terrific deal for America. The Clintons walked hand in hand with the republicans and everyone benefited. Well, almost everyone. Anyone ever ask the Unions why THEY were silent in 1994? Because, like the blacks, the gays and every other group associated with democrats, they would rather back the dems play than protect their own. So, old school, pour yourself a drink, sit on your ass, and just accept the fact that you were sodomized like the rest of the rust belt.

Total orders rose by 0.3%, Commerce Department figures have shown - much lower than the 0.8% increase forecast. A drop in transport orders was not particularly significant as it is a volatile category, analysts said. They argue a better guide to business spending is the growth in orders for non-defence capital items excluding aircraft, up 2.1% and higher in March. The Commerce Department also revised March's overall factory orders to a 4.1% gain, up from 3.1%, which added to confidence that US manufacturing maybe picking up after a recent slowdown linked to the cooling economy. The March data was heavily influenced by a large amount of aircraft orders. US manufacturing sentiment has been volatile in recent months, as companies have looked to trim new orders in the wake of a general slump in housing and a build-up in supplies of unsold cars. However, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods - items built to last for at least three years - rose by 0.8% during April, topping forecasts of a 0.6% rise. Orders for non-durable goods, such as petrol and chemicals, fell by 0.2%. E-mail this to a friend What approach will Democrats take to economic policy in Congress?

SXR, based in Toronto, values its offer at C$19.12 per Energy Metals share, 4.5 percent more than the June 1 closing price. SXR wants to gain a foothold in North America, which accounts for more than a quarter of global demand for the nuclear fuel. The price of uranium has increased more than fourfold in the past year as supply growth strains to keep up with demand that&#39;s been bolstered by global efforts to limit emissions of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. ``This fits with SXR&#39;s move to build a strategic position in the western U.S.,&#39;&#39; said Jim Taylor, an analyst at Canaccord Adams in London who rates SXR a buy. ``A strong point for U.S. consumers will be to have U.S. production&#39;&#39; of uranium. Shares of SXR fell 53 cents, or 3.2 percent, to C$16.10 at 4:15 p.m. in Toronto Stock Exchange trading. They have jumped 68 percent over the past year. Energy Metals&#39;s shares rose 15 cents, or 0.8 percent, to C$18.44, valuing the company at about C$1.53 billion. The stock price has surged threefold over the past year. The acquisition will help SXR meet its goal of producing 28 million pounds of uranium by 2013, up from 2.7 million pounds, SRX Chief Executive Officer Neal Froneman said in a conference call today. The combined company would trail only Cameco Corp. in global uranium reserves, the companies said in the statement. SRX is already the only producer with operations in each of the top five countries ranked by uranium deposits: Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, the U.S. and Canada. SXR bought UrAsia Energy Ltd. in April for $3.1 billion, giving it control of three mining and exploration projects in Kazakhstan and an exploration venture in Kyrgyzstan. SXR agreed in February to buy U.S. Energy Corp.&#39;s uranium assets in Utah for $142 million. ``We see the need for the creation of a major U.S. uranium producer to provide fuel for U.S. power facilities,&#39;&#39; Froneman said. ``Growth in production appears to be earmarked for Asian countries.&#39;&#39; ``We are seeing a nuclear renaissance in the U.S,&#39;&#39; he said. Uranium companies in the U.S. including Toronto-based Denison Mines Corp. produced 1.16 million pounds of the fuel in the country in the first quarter, 25 percent more than the year- earlier period, according to U.S. Department of Energy data. Uranium production in the U.S. rose 57 percent last year to 4.7 million ton, according to the government data. Energy Metals expects to complete the upgrading of a uranium processing plant in southern Texas next year, which will double the plant&#39;s output to 1 million pounds a year, according to today&#39;s statement. Demand in the U.S. is forecast to rise with the addition of as many as 31 nuclear reactors, a 30 percent increase from the existing 104. Worldwide uranium demand will more than double by 2030, the World Nuclear Association said last month. Uranium traded at $122 a pound today, according to Metal Bulletin. It averaged $47.42 a pound last year and traded as low as $6.95 in November 2000. SXR shareholders will own 79 percent of the combined company, which will have a market value of about $7.8 billion and cash of $678 million, the company said. The acquisition was approved by the boards of both companies and has yet to be voted on by shareholders, according to the statement. The agreement includes a C$55 million break fee payable to SXR if Energy Metals accepts any competing bids. SXR was advised by Bank of Montreal, Toronto-based Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP and Minneapolis-based Dorsey & Whitney LLP. Energy Metals was advised by GMP Securities LP and Stikeman Elliott LLP, both based in Toronto.

At the time, Mr. Whyte was editor of the National Post, which had been sold to CanWest Global Communication Corp. by Hollinger International Inc. Ms. Ruder pointed out that Lord Black arranged for Hollinger to pay the bonus to Mr. Whyte in order to keep up their association. She also noted that at the time Lord Black was bound by a non-competition agreement with CanWest that prohibited him from inducing or recruiting the paper's senior mangers. Mr. Whyte replied that he did not know details about Lord Black's non-competition agreement and he understood the bonus was for his past work with Hollinger. Testimony provides glimpse of Black's collectibles and tomes How Black built his empire');"> How Black built his empire Ms. Ruder read portions of a deposition Mr. Whyte gave as part of a lawsuit he filed in New York against Hollinger in 2005 over company stock options. (He settled the suit earlier this year.) In that deposition, Mr. Whyte said the bonus was paid in part to maintain their association. Mr. Whyte insisted the bonus was for his past work at the paper which had been "sold out from under him." He said Lord Black wanted to ensure that they were remained on good terms so they could work together again in future. Under questioning by Edward Greenspan, one of Lord Black's lawyers, Mr. Whyte confirmed that Lord Black talked about positions in Chicago or New York. Mr. Greenspan said the CanWest non-competition agreement only applied to Canada. During her questioning Ms. Ruder also referred to Mr. Whyte's alleged bias, asking him several times if he was friends with Lord Black and loyal to him. Mr. Whyte said he was "friendly" with Lord Black. As for his loyalty, Mr. Whyte said: "I suppose I am loyal to him." In her examination, Ms. Ruder referred Mr. Whyte to the prosecution's contention that Lord Black was on vacation in July, 2001 in Bora Bora. Hollinger paid for part of that trip, which prosecutors have argued was an abuse of company money. Lord Black's lawyers have argued that Lord Black ended up paying for most of the trip and that Lord Black worked all the time. Ms. Ruder showed Mr. Whyte e-mails from marketing people at the National Post around the time of the trip. The marketing people were trying to arrange a letter from Lord Black for an upcoming ad in a trade publication. However they were told that Lord Black was out of touch and "on vacation." Mr. Whyte said he could recall details about the e-mails and that the issue was not significant at the time. While there had been speculation that Donald Trump would appear as a witness today he was not called. Lord Black's lawyers later said they will not be calling Mr. Trump as a witness. They did not say why. Mr. Trump's name had been on a proposed list of witnesses for weeks. Also Monday morning, the jury was shown several invoices for furnishings and decorations for Lord Black's New York apartment. Prosecutors allege Lord Black paid too little when he bought the apartment from Hollinger for $3-million (U.S.) in 2000. That was the same price Hollinger paid in 1994. Lord Black's lawyers argue that he paid a fair price considering the amount he spent fixing up the place. This morning, Lee Williams, a forensic accountant, testified that Lord Black spent $4.6-million on the apartment. But under cross examination by prosecutor Eric Sussman, Mr. Williams acknowledged that some of those costs included items Lord Black took with him and therefore would not affect the value of the apartment. Mr. Sussman presented a list of some examples of the expenses, including a $9,750 plaque "depicting Amazon women," a $9,600 mother of pearl box, a $17,000 music system and a pair of white marble elephant reliefs which cost $17,710. Lord Black also spent $4,399 on heated towel bars, according to the invoices.

SXR will offer 1.15 of its shares for every one of Energy Metals, the two companies said on Monday in a statement. SXR, based in Toronto, values its offer at C$19.12 per Energy Metals share, 4.5% more than the June 1 closing price. SXR wants to gain a foothold in North America, which accounts for more than a quarter of global demand for the nuclear fuel. The price of uranium has increased more than fourfold in the past year as supply growth strains to keep up with demand from utilities. "This fits with SXR`s move to build a strategic position in the western US," said Jim Taylor, an analyst at Canaccord Adams in London who rates SXR a buy. "A strong point for US consumers will be to have US production" of uranium. Shares of SXR have jumped 70% over the past year. Energy Metals` shares rose 26 cents, or 1.4% to C$18.55, giving the company a C$1.54 billion market capitalization. The stock price has surged threefold over the past year. The acquisition "will create a powerhouse in the United States uranium sector with the potential to become the domestic supplier of choice for US utilities," SXR chief executive officer Neal Froneman said in the statement. If the acquisition is completed, the combined company would trail only Cameco Corp in output and be the only producer with operations in each of the top five countries ranked according to uranium deposit volumes. Those countries are Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, the US and Canada. Energy Metals expects to complete the upgrading of a uranium processing plant in southern Texas next year, which will double the plant`s output to 1 Mlb/y, according to Monday`s statement. Annual production at all of Energy Metals`s facilities will rise to as much as 10 Mlb by 2013, according to the statement. That values the output at more than US$1.2 billion at current prices, it said. SXR shareholders will own 79% of the combined company, which will have a market value of about US$7.8 billion and cash of US$678 million, the company said. The acquisition was approved by the boards of both companies and has yet to be voted on by shareholders, according to the statement. Monday`s agreement includes a C$55 million break fee payable to SXR if Energy Metals opts for any competing bids.

(TSX: ) says its $1.6-billion deal to take over Energy Metals Corp. (TSX: ) will give it a production forecast to rival that of industry leader Cameco Corp. by 2013. The arrangement â€“ exchanging 1.15 shares of Uranium One for each Energy Metals share â€“ continues a series of acquisitions for the South-Africa based company that will create a "powerhouse" in the United States uranium sector, said Neal Froneman, Uranium One's chief executive officer. The company said Monday it expects to produce about 28 million pounds of uranium, used to fuel nuclear power plants, by 2013. Of that, about 25 per cent is expected to come from the company's new mine in South Africa, Dominion Reefs. Uranium One said Cameco's (TSX: )production forecast is for more than 27 million pounds by 2011. "This will enhance Uranium One's unrivalled production growth profile," Froneman said on a conference call with analysts Monday. "This will go a long way toward our strategy of producing U.S. uranium for U.S. utilities." Froneman said the U.S. has 103 nuclear facilities with an annual demand of about 50 million pounds per year. But domestic production is only about four million pounds per year, he said. The deal's value, based on Uranium One's closing share price of $16.63 on Friday, represents a 28 per cent premium over the 20-day average before Energy Metals announced May 18 it was in talks for a sale. Energy Metals stockholders will own 21 per cent of the combined enterprise, which Uranium One said will have a market capitalization of US$7.8 billion. "This is a win-win for both groups of shareholders," Froneman said. "This transaction results in a powerhouse in the United States uranium sector." Froneman said the company is poised to profit from a shift in American attitudes towards nuclear power, as the country seeks to reduce its reliance on foreign energy sources. "There are clear signs of a nuclear renaissance in the United States," he said. The boards of both companies have approved the deal, Energy Metals shareholders are to vote on it in late July and it's expected to close in August. Energy Metals has agreed to pay a break fee of C$55 million if another bidder prevails. The deal follows a series of takeovers pursued by Uranium One as it seeks to position itself as a leading global uranium producer. The company completed a $3.2-billion stock-swap takeover of uranium producer UrAsia Energy Ltd. in April, and also issued 6.6 million shares to U.S. Energy Corp. in exchange for the Shootaring Canyon uranium mill in Utah and a large package of land in Utah, Wyoming, Arizona and Colorado. The company, which posted a loss last month of US$3.8 million for the first quarter ending March 31, is active in exploration and development of uranium and gold properties in South Africa, Australia and Canada. Jay Turner, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said the company has leg up on Cameco since it is not locked into long-term contracts at prices below the current market. The price for spot uranium is currently US$125 per pound. "We believe that Uranium One offers investors an attractive, unhedged production growth profile, broad geographic diversification, steady earnings and cash flow growth, as well as sufficient market capitalization and trading liquidity to be an alternative to industry leader Cameco," Turner wrote in a May 17 note to investors, in which he noted a $23 price target and sector outperform rating on the company. "While Uranium One is a higher-cost producer than Cameco, its unhedged position affords the opportunity in the medium term for much more robust gross operating margins, resulting in robust free cash flow," Turner wrote. Sxr Uranium One shares were down 3.5 per cent of 58 cents to $16.05 on the Toronto Stock Exchange Monday afternoon, while Energy Metals shares were up 12 cents to $18.41.

( Dominion Resources, Inc. ( XTO Energy Inc. ( NEW YORK (Reuters) - Loews Corp.'s $4.03 billion purchase of gas exploration and production assets from Dominion Resources Inc. gives the conglomerate a way to spend excess cash and diversify its revenue stream as it bets on rising natural gas prices. "It vindicates Loews' strategy of holding cash at the holding company level," said Matt Nellans, a Morningstar Inc. analyst. "It got a reasonable price and Dominion's exploration and production management team. Absent a complete bottoming out of natural gas prices, the deal should work out well." The two companies announced the deal on Monday. Loews shares rose to a record. The main properties being acquired are located in the Permian Basin in Texas, the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama and the Antrim Shale in Michigan, with estimated reserves of about 2.5 trillion cubic feet of gas. The price equates to about $1.61 per thousand cubic feet, Loews said. Loews Chief Executive James Tisch, whose billionaire family runs New York-based company, has been looking for ways to deploy some $5.5 billion in cash. Loews, the majority owner of natural gas pipeline operator Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP and Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. , plans to set up a new company for the acquired assets. It also will keep existing management, led by Timothy Parker, a Dominion senior vice president of exploration and production. Natural gas "will be a fuel of choice for years to come (as) we move into a world that is worried about global warming and greenhouse gases," Tisch said on a conference call. "We're seeing a reserve base in the United States that is, at best, staying flat, and we're seeing reduced importing of natural gas from Canada," he added. "If prices just stay where they are, we'll do very well with this investment." Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion is also selling other U.S. gas and oil operations to XTO Energy Inc. for $2.5 billion as it focuses on its power business. Loews expects a third-quarter closing. It said it may obtain bank loans, but not sell public debt, at the subsidiary level to help fund the acquisition. "This acquisition will further diversify Loews' holdings and reduce its concentration of cash flow from tobacco operations," Standard & Poor's credit analyst Rick Joy wrote. Loews' businesses include financial, tobacco, energy, hotel and watch-making. It said it owns 75 percent of Boardwalk, 51 percent of Diamond, 89 percent of insurer CNA Financial Corp. , and all of tobacco company Lorillard Inc., Loews Hotels and watchmaker Bulova Corp. Loews shares were up $1, or 2 percent, at $52.02 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Their previous high was $51.50, set on May 31. The shares began the year at $41.47.

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/c/a/2007/06/04/BAGADQ79FB9.DTL&cid No explanation yet for why Southwest jet's landing gear collapsed No explanation yet for why Southwest jet's landing gear collapsed Marisa Lagos, Chronicle Staff Writers Monday, June 4, 2007 (06-04) 11:45 PDT OAKLAND -- Officials for Southwest Airlines and the federal government were at Oakland International Airport today trying to figure out why the landing gear in a Boeing 737 collapsed in an emergency landing Sunday afternoon. None of the 119 passengers and crew members on board the flight, which was headed from Sacramento to San Diego, was injured. The runway where the jet made its landing was reopened at 5:45 a.m., 15 minutes ahead of schedule, and flights were on time today, airport spokeswoman Cyndy Johnson said, adding that the plane involved in Sunday's incident had been moved off the runway and onto another area of the airfield. More details began to emerge today about what happened during the emergency landing. Officials said that Southwest Flight 3050 departed Sacramento International Airport at 1:52 p.m. As the plane was en route to San Diego -- and was in fact closer to the Southern California city than to Oakland -- the pilots observed an indicator light showing a problem with the nose landing gear of the plane, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor. Gregor was unsure why the pilots opted to return to Northern California rather than land in San Diego or another airport. "The indicator light went on in cockpit, saying there might be something wrong," said Johnson. "It's not unlike a car -- sometimes the lights go on, and they are either alerting you to something wrong or they are malfunctioning." The pilots diverted the flight to Oakland and informed the passengers that there was an "issue" that needed to be checked. Meanwhile, the plane flew over San Francisco Bay as the pilots tried to get the landing gear to work properly, according to Southwest. Gregor said the pilots flew over Oakland Airport three times to test the landing gear and have officials in the air traffic control tower visually inspect the gear. During the first flyover, he said, the main landing gear under the wings appeared to be cocked to the side at a 45-degree angle instead of being pointed straight down. "They did it again, and the landing gear appeared to be in order," he said. "During the third flyby, they were still in order." Gregor said at that point, the pilot told the control tower that he had three green lights, indicating that all three of the plane's landing gear mechanisms, two under the wings and one under the nose, were working properly. "Everything appeared in order, and they landed and touched down," he said. "There was a shower of sparks, and the full emergency response." Beth Harbin, a spokeswoman for Southwest Airlines, said the landing gear collapsed but did not break off. "Essentially, what happened, the airplane landed on its main gear, at the back of the aircraft," Johnson said. "They went down a little ways and put the nose down, and essentially the nose gear collapsed. They traveled down the runway for a little bit of time before the plane stopped." None of the officials who spoke with The Chronicle today knew exactly how far the plane slid before stopping, but officials said Sunday that it most likely continued moving for a while, as planes are traveling at more than 100 mph when they land. The plane ended up resting nose-down and at an angle on the runway -- with its tail appearing to stick out over the runway edge. An emergency slide was deployed on one side of the plane, and 114 passengers and 5 crew members were evacuated safely. Officials said they were still in the process of determining whether the Federal Transportation Safety Board would investigate the emergency landing. The FTSB only investigates accidents, not situations deemed "incidents," Gregor said. "It's unclear whether it rises to the level of accident," he said. "There are incidents and there are accidents, and it depends on how much damage occurs." Gregor said FAA officials were inspecting the plane, looking at maintenance records and talking to the crew to see whether they will hand off the inquiry to the NTSB. A spokeswoman for Southwest said that airline officials were at the scene and conducting their own investigation. Johnson said Oakland airport would not investigate the emergency landing, but will conduct an internal inquiry of its response to the situation. "(The airport) will be evaluating how well we responded to the incident and use it as a learning experience so we can improve our response in case something like this happens again," she said. Records show that the plane has experienced some problems with landing gear in the past. On Aug. 20, 1994, the same plane made an unscheduled landing after taking off from Los Angeles International Airport, according to FAA records. Pilots were unable to raise the gear after takeoff and had to use an override handle to do so, records indicate. The plane returned to the airport and made an "uneventful landing;" mechanics readjusted a cable in the main gear. Sunday's incident had little impact on other travelers, Johnson said. "For the most part, we just have arrivals in the evening, and because of the additional runways at the north field location, it's just a few extra minutes of taxiing to send an aircraft over to an alternate runway," she said. "The delays were minimal -- we can't even call them delays." Harbin said the pilots were in the midst of a standard debriefing process today and were being made available to the FAA and NTSB as needed. Gregor praised the pilots' response to the emergency. "Pilots are trained in simulators to deal with situations like this. It's something they practice all the time," he said. "Obviously the pilot did exactly what he or she should have done." It is "certainly not a common" occurrence for landing gear to fail, he said. "To have a suspected problem isn't that unusual, but for it to collapse, it's not unheard of but it's rare," he said.

Under Panama, which was launched in February, sponsored search results are based on items such as relevancy and not just on the advertiser's bid price. Yahoo Search Marketing Commercial API Program , both businesses and individual developers have access to a series of application program interfaces (APIs) so that they can tweak the Panama platform to suit their individual needs. The company is offering three levels of partnership, ranging from a free "basic" deal for small advertising agencies and technology companies, to "advanced" and "elite" levels with varying subscription rates. All participants in the Panama APIs, regardless of partnership level, have access to the software platform and any related technical support. Advanced partners also have account management support and a listing in Yahoo's partner directory. Elite partners, according to Yahoo, can "leverage the Panama platform, resources and brand via regular business review, product council, road map coordination and joint marketing activities." The inaugural Elite partners in the API program include SearchIgnite, Efficient Frontier, Omniture and The Search Agency. Yahoo launched Panama earlier this year as a direct competitor to Google's successful advertising programs. So far, Panama's biggest success has been a deal with to provide sponsored search and contextual ads to 33 of its entertainment sites.

(RAD.N: said on Monday it had completed its acquisition of the Brooks and Eckerd drugstore chains in the United States after U.S. antitrust authorities said they had reached an agreement clearing the way for the deal. The acquisition of 1,854 Brooks and Eckerd stores from Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. (PJCa.TO: was finalized shortly after the Federal Trade Commission announced the companies had alleviated antitrust concerns by agreeing to sell 23 pharmacies in markets around the United States. "With a much larger Rite Aid, we're confident we will have substantial opportunities to reduce costs, improve operations and grow earnings per share, which will generate greater value for our shareholders." Rite Aid President and Chief Executive Mary Sammons said in a statement. The FTC said the stores to be divested would be sold to five other retailers, including Walgreen Co.

Rite Aid, the No. 3 U.S. drugstore chain, said the Jean Coutu Group had received $2.36 billion in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment, and 250 million shares of Rite Aid common stock in the transaction. Rite Aid said it expects a net loss for fiscal 2008 because of integration expenses, but the company also expects nine months of acquisition-related cost savings of approximately $155 million.

http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/06/04/ap3786312.html&cid Palm Sells 25 Percent Stake - Forbes.com Palm Sells 25 Percent Stake 06.04.07, 4:14 PM ET Faced with mounting competition in the smart-phone market, Inc. is selling a quarter of its company to a private equity firm to arm itself with new leadership, most notably the former technical guru behind the iPod. The deal with Elevation Partners - which agreed to invest $325 million for a 25 percent stake in Palm ) - will infuse new talent in the handheld computer pioneer as it battles stiffening competition that will only get tougher with )'s June 29 launch of the iPhone. "This is great for Palm, and it was probably the right time to bring in a change in top leadership," said industry analyst Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a consulting firm. "They needed a significant cash investment to take it to the next level and a partner who had the same vision." As part of the deal, Palm will pay a special distribution of $9 per share, or about $940 million in cash, to shareholders. It said the special distribution would be financed by the new investment, cash on hand and $400 million in new debt. Palm, best known for the Treo line of smart phones, said two board members - former CEO Eric Benhamou and D. Scott Mercer - will resign. Elevation partners' Fred Anderson and Roger McNamee will join Palm's board, and Apple Inc.'s former top hardware engineer, Jon Rubinstein will join the board as executive chairman. Rubinstein ran the iPod division at Apple from 2004 to 2006 and was key in the creation of Apple's iMac computer before that. He was part of the executive team that joined Apple after Steve Jobs returned to run the company. Anderson, the former chief financial officer of Apple, recently agreed to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges related to a stock options backdating probe at Apple. He also agreed to pay about $3.5 million in fines, without admitting wrongdoing. Anderson also serves as a director of ) and Move Inc. Among Elevation's five partners, besides Anderson and McNamee, is the rock star Bono, lead singer of U2. Elevation's investment in Palm is the firm's largest ever. "We don't think Palm is faltering or that there's anything wrong with the present," McNamee said in an interview. "We just think the future is incredibly bright." The $1.9 billion private equity firm seeks to strengthen Palm's position as it competes against more deep-pocketed rivals. "Today, you can't get your highest valued content to your phone, other than e-mail," McNamee said. "And we think that's going to change in the future." Sunnyvale-based Palm was the subject of extensive takeover speculation this year as it hired ) to examine its options, including a complete buyout. A range of major tech companies and private equity firms were rumored suitors. "We were approached by larger parties over the last six months," Palm Chief Executive Ed Colligan said, declining to be more specific. "The reality is that we thought this was the best outcome for our business and our investors." For years, Palm's primary smart-phone competitor was Research in Motion Ltd. ), maker of BlackBerry devices. But as ) Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. entered the fray last year with lower-priced, slimmer, consumer-oriented models, Palm's once-groundbreaking Treo design began to appear stale. Colligan said in a conference call with analysts Monday that Palm's roadmap for the next year is set, but he is looking forward to working with Rubinstein and drawing on his proven record of producing innovative products. Rubinstein will work with Palm's co-founder and top product designer, Jeff Hawkins, who pioneered the Palm Pilot and Treo smart phone. "That's just a team that can't be beat," McNamee told analysts. Seeking to recapture its innovative streak, Palm last week introduced a new laptop-like device, the Foleo, to work with smart phones. The gadget was panned by many industry observers, but Bajarin said he thinks Elevation's investment signaled that Palm likely had more promising products ahead. "I have to believe that if Rubinstein and McNamee have backed Palm, they see something that the rest of us don't," Bajarin said. "There's something else up their sleeve." Shares of Palm gained more than 9 percent, or $1.48, to $17.57 in Monday trading. Palm said the deal, which needs shareholder approval, will leave the company with more than $300 million of cash after the transaction. "The management shake up at Palm is the key takeaway," Think Equity analyst Jonathan Hoopes wrote in a note. "Today's deal should quiet skeptics as these new investors in Palm have 'been around the block' and clearly understand the value of a global brand, of a foundation based on software, and of design acumen." Some analysts, including Andrew Neff at ), speculated the board restructuring could lead to a partnership with Apple, but Colligan declined to comment, saying only that Palm "looks at them as a competitor and will continue to compete with them." Neff upgraded his bearish rating on Palm's stock from "underperform" to "peer perform," betting the private equity firm's involvement will address some investor concerns. But, he said, the company still has plenty of work ahead. "Fundamentally, Palm faces numerous challenges with intense competition in its phone business, a decline in its old handheld business and the lackluster response to the new product demo'd last week," Neff wrote in a note.

POSTED: 06-04-2007 01:28 PM ET | MODIFIED: 06-04-2007 01:28 PM ET Rite Aid Closes Eckerd Purchase HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP/WFMZ) Rite Aid says it has closed an approximately $3.9 billion deal to add more than 1,800 Brooks and Eckerd stores. The nation's third-largest drugstore chain will expand its already strong presence on the East Coast. Some analysts have criticized the acquisition as paying too much for underperforming stores. Under the deal, Rite Aid is paying $2.3 billion in cash and issuing 250 million shares for the Eckerd and Brooks operations of Canada's Jean Coutu Group. The deal was originally announced in August and has since received regulatory and shareholder approval. Rite Aid and Eckerd operate stores throughout the Lehigh Valley, some in very close proximity to each other.

Shareholders of Milpitas, California-based Solectron can choose to get 0.345 share of Flextronics or $3.89 in cash for each share, the companies said in a statement today. The cash bid is 15 percent more than Solectron&#39;s closing price on June 1. Flextronics said the deal for Solectron, the world&#39;s fifth- biggest electronics maker, will boost sales to about $30 billion annually, trailing Hon Hai&#39;s NT$1.32 trillion ($40 billion) in revenue last year. Solectron&#39;s customers include Cisco Systems Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. The deal ``adds a couple of good customer relationships in Cisco and IBM,&#39;&#39; Cowen & Co. analyst Louis Miscioscia said in an interview. ``It also gives them more size and scale, which allows them to make more efficient use of their facilities.&#39;&#39; Shares of Solectron gained 51 cents, or 15 percent, to $3.88 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Shares of Singapore-based Flextronics fell 16 cents to $11.54 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. ``It&#39;s a bit of a surprise and doesn&#39;t offer immediate accretion, so investors will be a little bit wary,&#39;&#39; Miscioscia said. ``But in the end it&#39;s the right thing for the company.&#39;&#39; The New York-based analyst rates Flextronics ``outperform&#39;&#39; and Solectron ``neutral.&#39;&#39; In 2006, the top 10 companies made up more than 70 percent of sales for the first time, forcing competitors to consolidate, according to Adam Pick, an analyst at iSuppli Corp. Since operating margins in the sector are usually only as high as 1.5 percent, companies benefit when they can combine their manufacturing facilities, Pick said. ``Leveraging scale is the trick to winning in this game,&#39;&#39; Pick, based in El Segundo, California, said in an interview. ``This is an epic deal. We haven&#39;t seen a deal of this size for years and years.&#39;&#39; Solectron&#39;s shareholders will own 20 percent to 26 percent of Flextronics&#39; outstanding shares, according to Miscioscia. As part of the agreement, Solectron has the right to nominate two individuals, approved by Flextronics, to the board of directors of the combined company. ``The segment is really pretty strong,&#39;&#39; Flextronics Chief Executive Officer Mike McNamara said in an interview. ``We view the overall industry as growing between 10 percent and 12 percent.&#39;&#39; McNamara took over as CEO in January 2006. The combination will cut costs by as much as $200 million after taxes in the 18 to 24 months after the deal is completed, and boost earnings per share by at least 15 percent, Flextronics said. The transaction should close by the end of this year. The company reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit tripled to $121 million as sales gained 32 percent. Under the offer, Flextronics will limit the proportion of Solectron&#39;s outstanding stock that will be converted into its shares to between 50 percent and 70 percent, the companies said. Solectron said in March it may eliminate as many as 1,500 jobs as it closes some factory space in North America and Western Europe. Last year, Flextronics bought International DisplayWorks Inc. to add liquid crystal displays for cell phones and portable MP3 music players. In August, Flextronics reached an agreement to produce digital cameras for Eastman Kodak Co. Citigroup Inc. is the financial adviser for Flextronics, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advises Solectron. Citigroup also agreed to provide Flextronics with a $2.5 billion, seven-year loan to help finance the purchase.

The main properties being acquired are located in the Permian Basin in Texas, the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama and the Antrim Shale in Michigan, with estimated reserves of about 2.5 trillion cubic feet of gas. The price equates to about $1.61 per thousand cubic feet, Loews said. A Dominion Resources employee in an undated photo courtesy of the company. Dominion said on Monday that it would sell most of its gas and oil exploration and production operations to two different companies for about $6.5 billion as part of its plan to focus on its power business. REUTERS/Handout Email to a friend New York-based Loews, the majority owner of natural gas pipeline operator Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP , plans to set up a new company for the acquired assets. It said it will also retain existing management, led by Timothy Parker, a Dominion senior vice president of exploration and production. Natural gas "will be a fuel of choice for years to come (as) we move into a world that is worried about global warming and greenhouse gases," Loews Chief Executive James Tisch said on a conference call. "We're seeing a reserve base in the United States that is, at best, staying flat, and we're seeing reduced importing of natural gas from Canada," he added. "If prices just stay where they are, we'll do very well with this investment." Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion is also selling other U.S. gas and oil operations to XTO Energy Inc. for $2.5 billion as it focuses on its power business. Tisch, whose billionaire family runs Loews, has been looking for ways to spend about $5.5 billion. In an April 30 conference call, he had set a goal to "continue diversifying (the) very significant cash flow that is coming up to the parent." Loews expects a third-quarter closing. It said it may obtain bank loans, though not sell public debt, at the subsidiary level to help fund the acquisition. Loews' businesses include financial, tobacco, energy, hotel and watch-making companies. It said it owns 75 percent of Boardwalk, 51 percent of Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. , 89 percent of insurer CNA Financial Corp. , and all of tobacco company Lorillard Inc., Loews Hotels and watchmaker Bulova Corp. CNA generates more than half of overall revenue. Loews shares were up 79 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.81 in noon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They began the year at $41.47.

No word was immediately available on the status of negotiations. In addition to the financial terms, News Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch has offered to create an independent editorial board to oversee Dow Jones' flagship operation, The Wall Street Journal. Dow Jones' other properties include MarketWatch, publisher of this report. But the Bancrofts may seek more, according to a report in Monday's Journal, which suggested that one option that might be discussed is giving the Bancrofts control over that Journal editorial board. Murdoch, however, indicated he would not accept such a proposal, saying he would not buy the newspaper unless he could run it. Murdoch made his bid in April, putting a 67% premium on the levels at which the stock had been trading. Initially, the Bancrofts said they would reject the proposal, but several family members reportedly experienced changes of heart, arguing that the family should meet with Murdoch. A news release Thursday said the family would explore the News Corp. bid and also consider other proposals. That $60-a-share News Corp. offer has not been sweetened, and other suitors have yet to come forward. Meanwhile, the union representing 2,000 Dow Jones employees seeks to find alternatives to a Murdoch takeover. The Independent Association of Publishers' Employees has retained Ownership Associates of Cambridge, Mass., to explore for other investors or possible partners for the Bancroft family. Russ Britt is the Los Angeles bureau chief for MarketWatch.

The deal with Elevation Partners _ which agreed to invest $325 million for a 25 percent stake in Palm _ will infuse new talent in the handheld computer pioneer as it battles stiffening competition that will only get tougher with Apple Inc.'s June 29 launch of the iPhone. "This is great for Palm, and it was probably the right time to bring in a change in top leadership," said industry analyst Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a consulting firm. "They needed a significant cash investment to take it to the next level and a partner who had the same vision." As part of the deal, Palm will pay a special distribution of $9 per share, or about $940 million in cash, to shareholders. It said the special distribution would be financed by the new investment, cash on hand and $400 million in new debt. Palm, best known for the Treo line of smart phones, said two board members _ former CEO Eric Benhamou and D. Scott Mercer _ will resign. Elevation partners' Fred Anderson and Roger McNamee will join Palm's board, and Apple Inc.'s former top hardware engineer, Jon Rubinstein will join the board as executive chairman. Rubinstein ran the iPod division at Apple from 2004 to 2006 and was key in the creation of Apple's iMac computer before that. He was part of the executive team that joined Apple after Steve Jobs returned to run the company. Anderson, the former chief financial officer of Apple, recently agreed to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges related to a stock options backdating probe at Apple. He also agreed to pay about $3.5 million in fines, without admitting wrongdoing. Anderson also serves as a director of eBay Inc. and Move Inc. Among Elevation's five partners, besides Anderson and McNamee, is the rock star Bono, lead singer of U2. Elevation's investment in Palm is the firm's largest ever. "We don't think Palm is faltering or that there's anything wrong with the present," McNamee said in an interview. "We just think the future is incredibly bright." The $1.9 billion private equity firm seeks to strengthen Palm's position as it competes against more deep-pocketed rivals. "Today, you can't get your highest valued content to your phone, other than e-mail," McNamee said. "And we think that's going to change in the future." Sunnyvale-based Palm was the subject of extensive takeover speculation this year as it hired Morgan Stanley to examine its options, including a complete buyout. A range of major tech companies and private equity firms were rumored suitors. "We were approached by larger parties over the last six months," Palm Chief Executive Ed Colligan said, declining to be more specific. "The reality is that we thought this was the best outcome for our business and our investors." For years, Palm's primary smart-phone competitor was Research in Motion Ltd., maker of BlackBerry devices. But as Nokia, Motorola Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. entered the fray last year with lower-priced, slimmer, consumer-oriented models, Palm's once-groundbreaking Treo design began to appear stale. Colligan said in a conference call with analysts Monday that Palm's roadmap for the next year is set, but he is looking forward to working with Rubinstein and drawing on his proven record of producing innovative products. Rubinstein will work with Palm's co-founder and top product designer, Jeff Hawkins, who pioneered the Palm Pilot and Treo smart phone. "That's just a team that can't be beat," McNamee told analysts. Seeking to recapture its innovative streak, Palm last week introduced a new laptop-like device, the Foleo, to work with smart phones. The gadget was panned by many industry observers, but Bajarin said he thinks Elevation's investment signaled that Palm likely had more promising products ahead. "I have to believe that if Rubinstein and McNamee have backed Palm, they see something that the rest of us don't," Bajarin said. "There's something else up their sleeve." Shares of Palm gained more than 9 percent, or $1.48, to $17.57 in Monday trading. Palm said the deal, which needs shareholder approval, will leave the company with more than $300 million of cash after the transaction. "The management shake up at Palm is the key takeaway," Think Equity analyst Jonathan Hoopes wrote in a note. "Today's deal should quiet skeptics as these new investors in Palm have 'been around the block' and clearly understand the value of a global brand, of a foundation based on software, and of design acumen." Some analysts, including Andrew Neff at Bear Stearns, speculated the board restructuring could lead to a partnership with Apple, but Colligan declined to comment, saying only that Palm "looks at them as a competitor and will continue to compete with them." Neff upgraded his bearish rating on Palm's stock from "underperform" to "peer perform," betting the private equity firm's involvement will address some investor concerns. But, he said, the company still has plenty of work ahead. "Fundamentally, Palm faces numerous challenges with intense competition in its phone business, a decline in its old handheld business and the lackluster response to the new product demo'd last week," Neff wrote in a note.

(LEND), a mortgage company specializing in non-prime residential mortgage loans, said it agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Lone Star Fund for $400 million in cash. The announcement comes two months after the company said it retained Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. to assist in exploring strategic options, including a merger. It recently obtained a $230 million term loan from hedge fund Farallon Capital Management LLC. Under the terms of the agreement, Lone Star will acquire each outstanding share of Accredited common stock for $15.10 per share, representing a 9.7% premium to Accredited's Friday's closing price of $13.76. The price per share also represents a premium of approximately 13.3% versus Accredited's 20-day volume weighted average share price ending on June 1, 2007. The acquisition is structured as an all-cash tender offer for all outstanding shares of Accredited to be followed by a merger in which each remaining untendered share of Accredited will be converted into the same $15.10 cash per share price paid in the tender offer. The tender offer is expected to commence within ten business days, unless extended. Subject to customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. The tender offer is not subject to a financing contingency. Meanwhile, the 9.75% Series A Perpetual Cumulative Preferred Shares, par value $1.00 per share of Accredited Mortgage Loan REIT Trust will continue to remain outstanding. Commenting on the deal, James Konrath, CEO of Accredited, said, "After a careful analysis, we believe this agreement is the best alternative available to protect shareholder value and provide the capital we need to support the company's business over the long-term. In Lone Star, we have found a partner who has a record of helping companies like ours successfully address financial and operational challenges." Accredited's Board, on the unanimous recommendation of a Special Committee composed entirely of independent directors, has unanimously approved the transaction. The acquisition will be effected pursuant to a merger agreement. In connection with this deal, Accredited got the financial advise from Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc. and Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, while Dewey Ballantine LLP and Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnel LLP were its legal advisors. Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. and Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin each rendered fairness opinion on the deal to Accredited's Special Committee. Lone Star is represented in the transaction by its financial advisor Piper Jaffray & Co., and its legal counsel, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. Many home loan providers, including, Accredited has been suffering with rising losses, mounting defaults. Subprime specialists, who offer loans at higher interest rates to homebuyers with blemished credit histories, have watched their stocks nose dive, gone on the sale block, posted hefty losses, exited business or declared bankruptcy. Recently, U.S. subprime lender New Century Financial Corp. (NEWCQ.PK) warned in a filing that all of its lenders have discontinued their short-term funding or notified the company of their intent to do so. In May, the San Diego, California-based Accredited delayed filing its audited first-quarter report and also expects a "significant loss" for the quarter compared to net income of $35.8 million for the comparable period in 2006. The company noted its first quarter results will be affected by losses on loan dispositions and expenses associated with higher delinquencies and cost restructuring initiatives. The company cut 1,300 of its 4,200 jobs in the first quarter. About Lone Star Funds Lone Star is a U.S. private equity firm. Since 1995, the principals of Lone Star have organized private equity funds totaling more than $13.3 billion to invest globally in corporate secured and unsecured debt instruments, real estate related assets and select corporate opportunities. Accredited is currently up $1.47 or 10.68% and trading at $15.23. For the past one-year, the stock has been trading in range of $3.77 - $51.35.

A few venture firms in particular will likely take big haircuts. Amp&#8217;d filed a list of its equity holders with the court, and by our math, various affiliates of own 11 percent of its equity through holdings of various classes of preferred stock. Columbia invests in communications and information technologies and was an early backer of , which has invested in companies such as Ask Jeeves and MapQuest, holds a total of about 9.5 percent of Amp&#8217;d. Amp&#8217;d has said it plans to reorganize and stay in business, but at this early stage it is impossible to know how much, if anything, preferred and common stockholders will recover. Amp&#8217;d must still find a way to pay or restructure its more than $100 million in liabilities. It owes $30 million to in the form of a secured note and owes $33 million in unsecured debt to . (In most bankruptcies, equity holders are wiped out completely.) What killed Amp&#8217;d Mobile? For one thing, it found that, although many of the customers in its target market of 18- to 25-year-olds enjoyed downloading songs, videos and games, they did not enjoy paying their bills. In May, it concluded that as many as 80,000 of its subscribers were likely to be &#8220;non-paying customers,&#8221; according to a document filed Monday with the court. Amp&#8217;d also cited a dispute with Verizon, its wireless network carrier, as a reason it landed in Chapter 11 protection. Other investors in Amp&#8217;d are The Red Herringâ€™s Cassimir Medford wrote Monday that at least one analyst believes that investors â€œwill be taking a much more skeptical view of startups that resell mobile services.â€ Such skepticism may have served investors better earlier on, notes Matt Marshall of VentureBeat, who on Sunday wrote an I-told-you-so post about Amp&#8217;d Mobile&#8217;s â€œspectacular crash.â€ To raise so much cash was risky &#8212; as weâ€™d pointed out back in March, when Ampâ€™d had raised its last $107 million &#8212; because other such networks have struggled.

Wal-Mart, the world&#39;s largest retailer, led the Standard & Poor&#39;s 500 Index to its fourth consecutive peak and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its 27th this year after four brokerages recommended the company because of its $15 billion share-buyback plan. Oil and gas companies climbed to a high after the price of crude surged above $66 a barrel on concern supplies from Nigeria may be disrupted. Shares overcame early declines sparked by the biggest-ever point slide in China&#39;s equity market. The agreement by Loews Corp. and XTO Energy Inc. to buy most of Dominion Resources Inc.&#39;s onshore oil and gas properties for $6.5 billion gave investors another reason to buy stocks. ``We&#39;ve got a good combination of bullish factors still in place,&#39;&#39; said Frederic Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co., which manages $17 billion in Great Falls, Montana. ``We still go higher from here.&#39;&#39; The S&P 500 added 2.84, or 0.2 percent, to 1539.18. The Dow average increased 8.21, or 0.1 percent, to 13,676.32. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 4.37, or 0.2 percent, to 2618.29. Wal-Mart climbed $1.74, or 3.5 percent, to $51.21 and contributed the most to the S&P 500&#39;s advance. The shares were upgraded by brokerages including JPMorgan following Wal-Mart&#39;s decision to buy back shares and reduce the number of stores it plans to open this year. Crude oil for July delivery rose 1.7 percent to $66.21 a barrel in New York after union officials in Nigeria&#39;s oil and gas industry said they plan to support a general strike. Energy shares in the S&P 500 climbed 1.2 percent as a group for the best gain among 10 industries. Anadarko Petroleum Corp. added $2.30 to $51.95. Chesapeake Energy Corp. increased $1.19 to $36.23. XTO Energy climbed $3.24, or 5.6 percent, to $61.61 for the No. 3 gain in the S&P 500. The oil and natural gas producer and Loews, the holding company owned by New York&#39;s Tisch family, agreed to buy most of Dominion&#39;s onshore oil and gas exploration business in separate transactions. Loews gained $1.33 to $52.35. Dominion added 23 cents to $87.87. China&#39;s CSI 300 Index dropped 292.52, or 7.7 percent, to 3511.43 after the government&#39;s main business newspaper said the speed at which stock prices soared was ``extremely unusual.&#39;&#39; It was the benchmark&#39;s biggest point slide on record and the second time in a week it has fallen by more than 6 percent. Chinese shares slid last week after the government tripled the stamp tax on securities trades to 0.3 percent. The measure, which doubled in the past six months, has tumbled 16 percent from its May 29 peak. About four stocks rose for every three that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.35 billion shares changed hands, 14 percent less than the three-month average. Among other deals in the U.S. today, Solectron Corp. climbed 51 cents, or 15 percent, to $3.88 for the best gain in the S&P 500. Flextronics International Ltd. agreed to acquire the electronics manufacturer for about $3.6 billion in cash and stock. Flextronics slipped 16 cents to $11.54. Sanmina-SCI Corp., the second-largest manufacturer of electronics for other companies after Flextronics, gained 20 cents to $3.75. Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. jumped $1.36 to $15.12 after the subprime lender that raised doubts about its survival agreed to sell itself to private-equity firm Lone Star Funds for about $400 million in cash, or $15.10 a share. Palm Inc. surged $1.48 to $17.57. The maker of the Treo mobile phone and e-mail device agreed to sell a 25 percent stake to private-equity firm Elevation Partners for $325 million and announced an overhaul of its board. ``There&#39;s a lot of global liquidity out there to fuel this M&A activity,&#39;&#39; said Tim Hartzell, who helps manage about $2 billion at Kanaly Trust Co. in Houston. ``There&#39;s still some room to go to the upside.&#39;&#39; Continental Airlines Inc., UAL Corp. and AMR Corp. fell after jet-fuel prices rose for a fourth straight day and a Continental monthly report raised concerns that revenue may fall short of expectations. Continental, the fourth-biggest U.S. carrier, said early figures show May per-passenger revenue fell as much as 1.5 percent. JPMorgan cut its second-quarter earnings estimate for the airline to $1.75 a share from $2.38 and its 2007 estimate to $3.96 from $4.59. Continental shares dropped $2.43 to $37.45. UAL, parent of United Airlines, declined $2.57 to $36.21. AMR, owner of American Airlines, slipped $1.38 to $27.09. The Russell 2000 Index, a benchmark for companies with a median market value of $664 million, gained 0.2 percent to 855.09. The Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 Index, the broadest measure of U.S. shares, added 0.2 percent to 15,569.19. Based on its advance, the value of stocks increased by $45.7 billion.

The nation's third-largest drugstore chain will expand its already strong presence on the East Coast, although some analysts have criticized the price being paid for underperforming stores. The acquisition is Rite Aid's first major deal after a turnaround team arrived in late 1999 to pull the company from the brink of bankruptcy. "Today we are a bigger, stronger company and we're in a much better position to take advantage of growth in the drugstore sector," Rite Aid's Chief Executive Mary Sammons said in a telephone interview. Sammons, who was part of the turnaround team, was appointed chairman Monday, taking over for Bob Miller, who will remain on the board. Under the deal, Rite Aid is paying $2.36 billion in cash and issuing 250 million shares for the U.S. Eckerd and Brooks operations of Canada's Jean Coutu Group Inc. Shares of Rite Aid closed up 19 cents at $6.55 in trading Monday. The agreement, announced Aug. 24, originally required Rite Aid to assume $850 million in debt from Jean Coutu Group. Rite Aid increased its cash offering to $2.36 billion after Jean Coutu Group initiated a tender offer for the debt. The acquisition made Jean Coutu Group the largest Rite Aid shareholder, with approximately 32 percent of common stock and about 30 percent of voting power. With the Brooks and Eckerd buyout complete, Rite Aid will operate about 5,160 stores in 31 states and the District of Columbia, although it has said it will close up to 200 stores to avoid overlap. Jobs will be available for all affected store employees, although about 475 employees from Jean Coutu's U.S. headquarters in Warwick, R.I., will be let go in the coming year, Rite Aid said. CVS Corp., based in Woonsocket, R.I., is currently the nation's leader with more than 6,160 drug stores. Deerfield, Ill.-based Walgreen Co. operates more than 5,700 stores. Both companies' stores also perform better than Rite Aid's. "We'll close any gap that there is with our competitors in those neighborhoods that we operate in," Sammons said. Federal and state regulators required Rite Aid to divest 26 stores, all in East Coast states, a number that was smaller than Rite Aid originally expected. Camp Hill, Pa.-based Rite Aid plans to spend more than $1 billion rebranding and remodeling the acquired stores and distribution centers in the next several years. The new stores are to be converted to Rite Aid's systems and signage within 16 months, the company said.

Photograph: Robert Sullivan/AFP/Getty Online gambling company PartyGaming has started talks with the US department of justice to find out whether it could be prosecuted for taking online bets in America before the recent ban there. The move follows legal action against its rivals. The world's biggest poker company said yesterday it was meeting the attorney's office for the southern district of New York and was voluntarily responding to a request for information from the office. Last October legislation in effect banned internet gaming in the US and several executives at online firms were arrested before and after the move, including at Betonsports and Sportingbet. "Actions have been taken by certain US law enforcement agencies with respect to third parties that had previously been involved in the online gaming sector in the US," PartyGaming said in a statement. "This has created some uncertainty as to what actions, if any, US law enforcement agencies may take against industry participants, based on activity in the US prior to October 13 2006." PartyGaming issued a profits warning last month because of the cost of signing up new players. The company stopped taking bets in the US following the ban and has had to work furiously to rebuild its customer base elsewhere. It said yesterday it was too early to assess how talks with US authorities would end. Separately, online payment firm Neteller told the market it had agreed to a plan for US customers to access money in their accounts for the first time since its funds were frozen in February.

The justices said Geico General Insurance Co. did not violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act and that Safeco Insurance Co. of America might have, but did not do so recklessly. In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article Consumer groups point to the notification requirement as the cornerstone to cleansing credit reports of inaccurate information. The case has significant implications for pending class-action lawsuits seeking billions of dollars in punitive damages on behalf of consumers who say they should have been notified, but weren't. In order for a company to be found liable, its conduct must entail an unjustifiably high risk of harm that is either known to a company or is so obvious that it should have been known, wrote Justice David Souter. "It's not a great decision for consumers, but there are some silver linings," said Scott Shorr, a Portland, Ore., attorney representing plaintiffs in the case against Safeco and Geico. The court ruled that the law's notification requirements apply to initial applicants, which means new customers will be informed when their credit scores affect the rates they're being quoted. But the court overturned an appeals court ruling that would have required notification of the vast majority of customers. Notification would have been the rule unless consumers were paying the very lowest rate offered to those with the very best credit ratings. Under such an expansive notification standard, Safeco would have been required to notify 80 percent of its new customers, while at Geico, just 10 percent of new customers qualify for the top tier of credit, lawyers representing the companies say. The court agreed with Geico's approach, which was to compare the rate a customer is being offered with the rate that would be charged if the company had not taken the credit score into account. The companies lost on their contention that in order to be found liable for a willful violation, it must be shown that they knew they were breaking the law. The court said "reckless disregard" was sufficient. But the justices laid down a restrictive definition. The court's ruling on the liability question was unanimous, while the decision on notification was 7-2.

The recently released numbers show the western region of the United States rising 2.8 percent in violent crime. Throughout the nation the homicide rates rose slightly and robberies increasing by six percent. The FBI numbers were released just as the US Justice Department began a push to give more money to local police and send more federal agents to troubled cities. Despite the difficulties, Attorney General Alberta Gonzales says cracking down on violent crime will be one of his top priorities before the Bush administration leaves office at the end of 2008.

The justices said Geico General Insurance Co. did not violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act and that Seattle-based Safeco Insurance Co. of America might have, but did not do so recklessly. Consumer groups point to the notification requirement as the cornerstone to cleansing credit reports of inaccurate information. The case has significant implications for pending class-action lawsuits seeking billions of dollars in punitive damages on behalf of consumers who say they should have been notified, but weren't.

The court said "reckless disregard" was sufficient. But the justices laid down a restrictive definition. The court's ruling on the liability question was unanimous, while the decision on notification was 7-2. On the liability question, the court supported "a middle-of-the-road position," said Gene Schaerr, chair of appellate and Supreme Court practice at the law firm of Winston & Strawn. "The court adopted what initially would have been a pro-plaintiff position, but in actually applying the definition, they have a very narrow interpretation of 'reckless.' Schaerr filed court papers in the case on behalf of FreedomWorks Foundation, a private group supporting the insurance companies. On the notification question, "I find it difficult to believe that Congress could have intended for a company's unrestrained adoption of a 'neutral' score to keep many if not most consumers from ever hearing that their credit reports are costing them money," Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in dissent. Credit reporting agencies generate over 1.5 billion consumer reports per year. Congress passed the credit reporting act in 1970 to protect consumers from flaws in the system and improve the reliability of reports so the business sector can accurately gauge risk. The case is Safeco v. Burr, 06-84.

It&#39;s making a share-swap bid for Energy Metals Corp, which is registered in Canada but since starting up in mid-2004 has acquired uranium rights over more than 250 000 acres in the Western US - just over 40% of this in Wyoming alone. At the proposed ratio of 1 15 sxr per EMC share, pro forma market cap of the combined company is $7.8bn, of which current sxr shareholders will own 79% and EMC shareholders 21%. But for this roughly 25% increase in its issued equity, sxr is lifting its target annual production profile for 2013 by more than 50% to 28m lb, of which EMC will contribute a disproportionate 11m lb. This reflects the fact that, though sxr is offering a 28% premium to EMC&#39;s pre-bid share price, the market priced EMC&#39;s resource base at the equivalent of only $4.28/lb, one of the lowest valuations in the sector. By contrast, the present biggest producer, Cameco, has a production target of 27m lb by 2011. Of course, that could still increase in the ensuing two years; but then, the latest deal doesn&#39;t exhaust sxr&#39;s ambitions, either. At today&#39;s briefing, VP Jean Nortier said that while sxr would probably only be interested in "consolidating" its interests in the three areas - Kazakhstan, the US and SA - where it is now well represented, it would like to "balance" its portfolio in the other two major uranium provinces, Canada and Australia, where its only interest is the relatively minor Honeymoon property in South Australia. Of the EMC properties, the Hobson facility in South Texas should come into production next year, with the first output in Wyoming following two years later, in 2010. The use of EMC material should also allow sxr&#39;s Shootaring mill, in neighbouring Utah, to start producing that year, two years earlier than originally planned. Virtually all the EMC production is expected to cost less than $20/lb . sxr agrees with a recent study that suggests that the price, now just over $130/lb, could hit at least $155. Nortier added that sxr has contracts to sell almost all that 2013 production of 28m lb. Forward sales aren&#39;t hedged, but contracts provide for a price equal to the spot price at the time of delivery, with a minimum floor price but no ceiling. Meanwhile, trial production started at sxr&#39;s Dominion Reefs project in SA in April, and is said to be going well. Production at the first UrAsia project in Kazakhstan, Akdala, is also building up ahead of budget and generating "significant" cash flow, which is being re-invested in the four times bigger South Inkai project, where production should start in the first quarter of this year. With all this good news, you wonder why the notional market cap of the combined sxr/EMC is dwarfed by Cameco&#39;s, of about $21bn. Fact is, of sxr&#39;s handsome claimed resource base, only a small proportion falls into the "proven and probable" category. Not only Cameco, but smaller rivals like Paladin and Australia&#39;s ERA, have higher "proven and probable" reserves. Sxr may be confident that it can prove up its reserves, but until it actually does so the share price will always be discounted, to some extent. 0.5% of your home loan back in upfront rewards vouchers.

Lone Star will buy Accredited's shares for $15.10 each in cash, a 10% premium to the company's closing price on June 1. The 9.75% Series A perpetual cumulative preferred shares of Accredited Mortgage Loan REIT Trust will remain outstanding, Accredited said. Accredited shares rose as much as 12% and changed hands at $15.39, up $1.63, during afternoon trading. Subprime mortgages are offered to poorer home buyers with blemished credit records. Rising interest rates and flat house prices have sparked a jump in delinquencies and foreclosures. That in turn has touched off a rash of bankruptcies among originators such as New Century Financial . Many analysts predicted earlier this year that few subprime lenders will remain independent after the crisis in the sector subsides. "This agreement is the best alternative available to protect shareholder value and provide the capital we need," said James Konrath, chief executive of San Diego-based Accredited , in a statement. "In Lone Star, we have found a partner who has a record of helping companies like ours successfully address financial and operational challenges." Lone Star has raised more than $13 billion to invest in corporate debt, real estate and acquisitions. The firm has also invested in non-performing loans and notes on its Web site that what it called the banking system's tendency to "cyclically over-finance and then under-finance" the property business and other sectors presents investment opportunities. "We are confident that Accredited can successfully manage through the current industry dynamics and leverage the platform," said Len Allen, president of Lone Star Funds' U.S. operations, in a statement.

To finance a back-end infrastructure overhaul necessary to maintain operations, the company is expecting to restructure its more than $100 million in debt. The Verizon Wireless-based reseller has issued an official statement saying: “As a result of our rapid growth, our back-end infrastructure was unable to keep up with customer demand. We are taking this step as a necessary and responsible action to sustain and strengthen our momentum in the marketplace.” With 200,000 subscribers and an ARPU of around $100, Amp'd has recouped some of the $360 million in investments from MTV Networks, Universal Music Group and others. But the content and multimedia-focused Amp’d still owes about $33 million to underlying network provider Verizon, $16 million to handset partner Motorola Inc., and various sums to Universal, BestBuy and MTV — presumably leaving it without the available capital to beef up the billing and order systems to operate at scale, since the company’s total assets are less than that sum. Sources inside the company have been reported as saying that a collections maelstrom arising from its postpaid billing model has forced the MVNO’s hand: In the quest to add customers, stringent credit checks weren’t performed, leading to a plethora of costly bad-debt subscribers. Meanwhile, subscribers have come forward to complain of billing inaccuracies and timeliness issues. Is it time to add Amp’d to the dead pool? The company itself stressed that it is not going out of business and said it would continue normal business operations throughout the reorganization process, while Amp'd Mobile's senior management team remains “largely intact.” The blogosphere, meanwhile, is more skeptical, with opinion split evenly as to Amp’d continuing prospects and ability to emerge unscathed from Chapter 11. The viability of the MVNO model in general has come under fire of late, after the high-profile demise of Mobile ESPN and the fact that youth-oriented Virgin Mobile USA remains not only unprofitable, but more than $500 million in debt after five years in business (as it revealed in its IPO filings). The virtual reseller approach hinges on the ability to create a strong enough marketing brand to profitably attract and retain a highly segmented set of users that has been overlooked by the big network operators. With no network infrastructure to support and a wide variety of mobile virtual network enablers out there to support the billing end of things, the idea is to be able to offer more personalized, tailored services than the mass market wireless companies. However, the business has proven to need much deeper pockets than originally thought. For its part, Amp’d made the decision to handle billing itself (based on systems from bcgi) and to offer postpaid calling plans. It also has made 3G content and enhanced applications such as social networking and Web-mobile integration its primary focus, hoping to capture the tech-savvy 20-something market. Will these business realities play out in Amp’d’s favor? There’s no word on restructuring plans yet, so industry watchers will have to wait and see.

However, the company said it could not yet assess â€œthe likelihood of any particular outcome of these discussionsâ€. , another internet gaming group, was considering making a statement later in the day about its position. The talks come as pressure builds in the US for reform of earlier legislation banning internet gambling. Analysts speculated that the talks suggested PartyGaming thought it could come to an agreement with the US Department of Justice to end the uncertainty which has clouded the industry over the legal position of online gaming in the US since the introduction of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act in October. â€œWhy would PartyGaming do this unless it believed it had a very high chance of a favourable outcome?â€ said one analyst. Analysts pointed to rival Sportingbetâ€™s deal with the State of Louisiana in March when warrants for Peter Dicks were dropped and the company made a reported payment of $400,000 to settle the case against its former chairman. They said they thought PartyGaming would expect to be reasonably confident of being able to agree a financial settlement that would not be too onerous. There appears to have been a change in sentiment in the US since last October when the government passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act which outlawed online gambling. Since then there have been fears that online gambling rather than stopping has gone underground. PartyGaming stopped any US based customers having access to its website when the act was passed but there is still uncertainty over the legal position on online gaming before the Act was passed, a risk PartyGaming highlighted in its prospectus when it floated two years ago. When the Act was passed, PartyGaming lost three-quarters of its customers who were US-based and its share price plunged along with those of other companies in the sector. Richard Carter, analyst at Numis Securities, said in a note to clients, â€œthere now appears a willingness on behalf of the US Attorneyâ€™s Office to settle and draw a line under the uncertainty caused by recent DoJ actions towards online gaming companies that participated in the US prior to the enactment of the UIEGAâ€. There has been some recovery in share prices in recent months as speculation mounted that the mood in the US was changing. Partygaming shares, which slumped to 25Â½p following the US ban, have recovered in recent months. On Monday morning fell 0.5 per cent to 41p. The uncertainty has made PartyGaming unattractive to potential bidders, but if it were removed, analysts said, an approach could come from companies such as MGM or Harrahâ€™s. Alternatively, a recovery in PartyGamingâ€™s share price might allow it to make bids for other companies as the sector consolidates. Also if the US did change the law to allow online gambling, a settlement with the Department of Justice would permit PartyGaming to return to the market.

(not case-sensitive) Microsoft contracts Flextronics to make Xbox 360 components (Source: Xbox-Scene) Electronics manufacturing giant Flextronics swallows Solectron Electronics manufacturer Flextronics International Ltd. said today that it will acquire Solectron Corporation in a multi-billion dollar deal. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, shareholders of Solectron will receive total consideration currently valued at approximately $3.6 billion, based on the closing price of Flextronics ordinary shares on June 1, 2007. "By joining forces, we expect the increased scale will enable us to further extend our market segment reach and leverage an increased vertical integration opportunity, realize significant cost savings, and better serve the needs of our combined customers, employees and shareholders," said Mike McNamara, CEO of Flextronics. Operating in 35 countries, with a combined workforce of approximately 200,000 employees, including approximately 4,000 design engineers, the combined company's annual revenues will exceed $30 billion across seven diversified customer market segments and several vertical component divisions. "We believe Flextronics has the large scale integration expertise and systems infrastructure capable of successfully integrating and managing the combined company to ensure all of the significant synergies are realized," said Paul Tufano, executive VP and interim CEO of Solectron. "Moreover, with the significant stock component offered in the transaction, Solectron's shareholders have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the realization of that value." Thomas J. Smach, CFO of Flextronics, says about the dollars and cents of the deal, "While some synergies will be achieved in the first 12 months after closing, it could take up to 18-24 months to fully integrate this acquisition and realize the full synergy potential, which we estimate to be at least $200 million after tax." The acquisition is expected to close by the end of calendar year 2007. Until the acquisition is completed, both companies will continue to operate their businesses independently. Marcus, I really like your stories, you post some great happenings. However, this must be the fourth or fifth time I've asked, Link the .pdf press release: I don't see why it is necessary to state sources in a news article. I don't see most other sites or other types of publications doing the same, and you can so quickly search for more information using a web search engine that knowing the exact source the author was using is unnecessary, in my opinion. Time to sell all my Solectron stock! ...buying all these American companies. Keep **American** jobs in America. Thank the Bushsquad for another economic f_ckup! This wouldn't happen if the government owned all companies, you know. ;) This happens all over the world. Allot of Swedish companies have been and are being bought by American. A very good example is Volvo which used to represent everything Swedish. Is now since some time ago owned by an American company. Other examples are Astrazeneca and Pfizer (I think). It's nothing personal it's business they used to say. the problems are with the corporation... the Bush squad has done more to try to keep more business in the states as this is where their paycheck comes from. The real problem was the previous administration outsourcing much of the American workforce. LOL, are you kidding - blaming the Clinton Administration?!? No, you must be referring to the Bush Administration in his first term! Anyway, how much control do you think the president has over M&A activity of companies like this? Anti-trust is the main way they could block a merger, but other than that, I don't see how the administration has much influence over these types of deals, or outsourcing for that matter.

From egaming review ... PartyGaming is in the process of voluntarily responding to a request for information from the US attorneyâ€™s office for the Southern District of New York, it announced this morning. News of the discussions between Party and the US authorities comes after months of speculation about further actions by the Department of Justice towards those involved in the online gambling sector. Forbes magazine is reporting that the Gibraltar-based group said it initiated the talks in response to actions taken by law enforcement agencies against other Internet gambling companies which had US-facing operations before the enactment of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) in October last year. It believes these have created uncertainty as to what actions the US justice authorities could take against other industry participants. Sources familiar with the matter told Thomson Financial News the pre-emptive move was motivated by a desire to remove that uncertainty. PartyGaming admitted it is too early to assess the likely outcome of the discussions, however, adding that a further announcement will be made if and when appropriate. The company is also voluntarily responding to a request for information issued by the Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. The UIGEA effectively banned online gambling in the US and PartyGaming, which had derived around 75 pct of its revenues from the US, was forced to stop customers in the US from planning or making deposits on any of its sites. James Hollins, an analyst at broker Daniel Stewart, said he believes this is 'the most sensible route for operators that used to offer their services into the US, essentially working with the authorities to hopefully draw a line under any potential ongoing litigation'. 1. Uncoded credit card transactions ? 2. WSOP Seat for Alberto Gonzales ? 3. Confession that "poker is illegal" as quid pro quo for getting an indulgence ? This has exciting implications indeed, although 2. is probably the most likely. Last month, BetOnSports PLC pleaded guilty to federal racketeering charges accepting that it had committed 'repeated mail and wire fraud, operated an illegal gambling business, laundered money and admitted to multiple state gambling felony charges'. The majority of BetonSports' revenues had come from the US. The company is now in the process of filing for bankruptcy. BetOnSports founder Stephen Kaplan and chief executive David Carruthers, a former Ladbrokes PLC executive, remain under arrest and the plea deal will not end their prosecution. In March, Sportingbet PLC said it had reached an 'amicable' resolution with authorities in Louisiana and that warrants for the arrest of its former chairman Peter Dicks and other executives had been dropped. The industry is still holding out hope that the US Congress could reverse the legislation. Barney Frank, the Democratic chairman of the House financial services committee, remains committed to overturning the UIGEA but conceded recently that the move lacked support among lawmakers. PartyGaming refused to comment further on today's statement. Feel free to interact with others about this topic in our popular message boards below... Site Copyright 2006 - Eye On Gambling

The reported $17 a share price, a 6 percent premium over Avaya's Friday close of $16.08, sent its shares up more than 4 percent to a two and a half year high. Deal speculation had already pushed the stock up 15 percent last week. The deal could break down, or Avaya could fall into the hands of another suitor, such as Canada's Nortel Networks Corp. , the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Silver Lake and Avaya declined comment and TPG was not immediately available. The sign at Avaya Inc. offices and lab in Westminster, Colorado is seen January 23, 2007. Private-equity firms TPG Capital LLP and Silver Lake Partners are in a leading position to buy telecommunications equipment company Avaya Inc. for about $17 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Monday. REUTERS/Rick Wilking Email to a friend Avaya's small size compared with rivals like Cisco Systems Inc. has long made the company a subject of takeover speculation. Such talk intensified last week after Avaya postponed an investor conference. "I think that $17 is a very good price for Avaya," said Kaufman Brothers analyst Manuel Recarey, who believes that private equity investors are the most likely buyers. "It does not fit in to the type of acquisitions Cisco makes" Recarey said. "Nortel, I just don't think they'll have the financial wherewithal to do it." Avaya shares rose 49 cents, or more than 3 percent, to $16.45 on the New York Stock Exchange after the report. A deal would follow a spate of mergers in the telecommunications-equipment industry with recent big deals including the formation of Alcatel-Lucent and a venture between the network units of Nokia and Siemens AG. Avaya, which generates about $5 billion in annual revenue, leads the market for office equipment for Web-based telephone calls despite its small size relative to rivals Nortel and Cisco, according to Recarey.

Consumer groups point to the notification requirement as the cornerstone to cleansing credit reports of inaccurate information. In order for a company to be found liable, its conduct must entail an unjustifiably high risk of harm that is either known to a company or is so obvious that it should have been known, wrote Justice David Souter . The court ruled that the law&#145;s notification requirements apply to initial applicants, which means new customers will be informed when their credit scores affect the rates they&#145;re being quoted. Under such an expansive notification standard, Safeco would have been required to notify 80 percent of its new customers, while at Geico, just 10 percent of new customers qualify for the top tier of credit, lawyers representing the companies say. The companies lost on their contention that in order to be found liable for a willful violation, it must be shown that they knew they were breaking the law. The court said "reckless disregard" was sufficient. But the justices laid down a restrictive definition. On the liability question, the court supported "a middle-of-the-road position," said Gene Schaerr, chair of appellate and Supreme Court practice at the law firm of Winston & Strawn. "The court adopted what initially would have been a pro-plaintiff position, but in actually applying the definition, they have a very narrow interpretation of &#145;reckless.&#145; On the notification question, "I find it difficult to believe that Congress could have intended for a company&#145;s unrestrained adoption of a &#145;neutral&#145; score to keep many if not most consumers from ever hearing that their credit reports are costing them money," Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in dissent. Congress passed the credit reporting act in 1970 to protect consumers from flaws in the system and improve the reliability of reports so the business sector can accurately gauge risk. -- -- -- --

The transaction values Accredited Home at $15.10 per share, a 9.7 percent premium over its Friday closing price.

The sale comes two months after the San Diego-based company Home said it was exploring a merger and that auditor Grant Thornton LLP had resigned. Accredited Home recently obtained a $230 million loan from hedge fund Farallon Capital Management "It's not a surprise, given the state of the industry," said Matt Howlett, an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton Inc. in New York. "Private equity firms are gravitating toward subprime in anticipation the industry will turn." Howlett called the valuation "fair." In morning trading, Accredited Home shares rose $1.51, or 11 percent, to $15.27 on the Nasdaq. Shares of NovaStar Financial Inc. , another subprime lender up for sale, rose as much as 6.4 percent. Private equity firms typically buy companies, restructure their businesses, and sell them. Dallas-based Lone Star said it has raised $13.3 billion since its 1995 founding. "An alliance with a strong partner is, we believe, the best alternative to ensure the long-term success of the company," Accredited Home Chief Executive James Konrath said in an e-mail to employees. "Accredited can go forward with its business as before, but with greater access to capital and resources." The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter. Top Accredited Home executives will keep their current roles. A Lone Star spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for Accredited Home and Farallon did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Accredited Home cut 1,300 of its 4,200 jobs in the first quarter as lending volume sank 47 percent and delinquencies tripled. Results also suffered from the company's October purchase of Los Angeles subprime lender Aames Investment Corp. Dozens of subprime lenders, including New Century Financial Corp. , have quit the industry or gone bankrupt in the last year. "It's the end of the specialty mortgage player, for now," Howlett said. "You need a big balance sheet to compete, and diversified sources of funding. It's everything the pure subprime lenders don't have." Bear Stearns & Co., Friedman Billings Ramsey Group Inc., Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin and the law firms Dewey Ballantine LLP and Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell LLP advised Accredited Home.

Black's lawyers began laying out their defence late last week after 11 weeks of accusations by prosecutors, and have thus far focused on minor charges that revolved around Black's unauthorized removal of boxes from his Toronto office. While some observers found the lack of focus on the crucial "non-compete" payments at the heart of the government's case unusual, others say it's a signal the defence is confident Black will be acquitted. "You touch the fringes of the case when you feel pretty strong about your chances on the main parts," said Steven Skurka, a Canadian criminal lawyer following the trial and writing a blog about it. Prosecutors accuse Black, Jack Boultbee and Peter Atkinson of orchestrating a scheme to improperly pocket millions of dollars in fees in exchange for a promise not to compete with the buyers of Hollinger publications. They say the buyers never requested those agreements, and the money should have gone to shareholders. Hollinger lawyer Mark Kipnis is accused of facilitating the alleged fraud and of taking a pay off. A lot of attention has also been directed at Black's alleged use of company money to fund his lavish lifestyle, and prosecutors have repeatedly pointed to a $62,869 party.

Executives at the Seattle-based company said they decided to steer clear of digital-rights management technology, because consumers want to be able to listen to their downloads on any device they choose. Bill Carr, Amazon.com's vice president of digital media, said the company believes its DRM-free strategy "is helping to pave the way for a much better, much more customer-centric experience in digital music." Seattle-based Amazon.com did not say how much it will charge for music downloads, which will be sold a la carte rather than through a subscription service. Carr said Amazon.com has always focused on giving customers good bargains and hinted that music will be offered at various prices. "We have a track record of being very competitive on price and offering very low prices to customers," Carr told The Associated Press. "We also have a track record of offering a wide range of price points on our products, too. There's not one or two or three price points on our CD store today - there are many, many different price points." Amazon.com said its store will feature millions of songs from 12,000 labels, but announced only one of its partners: Britain's EMI Music Group PLC. Amazon.com said it would announce more labels when the service goes live, but did not specify a launch date. Last month, EMI agreed to let Apple sell tracks without the copy-protection technology on its iTunes Music Store. The DRM-free tracks cost 30 cents more than copy-restricted versions of EMI songs, which cost 99 cents per track. The premium tracks also feature enhanced sound quality. Apple has yet to begin selling the EMI tracks, but has said it would make them available on iTunes sometime this month. Asked how Amazon.com plans to compete with Apple's market-leading iTunes store, Carr said the Web merchant has a huge customer base, with 66 million active accounts, and touted the success of its CD store, which in the United States alone offers some 1 million titles. Barney Wragg, head of EMI's global digital division, said the company believes Amazon.com's entry in the digital music business will make an intensely competitive market even more competitive. "Amazon has proven it's a really competitive, successful retailer in the CD business and we're very excited about having people who have a proven track record come into the download business," Wragg said. EMI also announced deals to sell music without copy restrictions in France, through Virgin Stores' VirginMega chain, and with several online music retailers in Denmark, Norway, Sweden. Warner Music Group and Sony BMG Music Entertainment, a joint venture of Sony Corp. and Bertelsmann AG, declined to comment. Vivendi's Universal Music Group did not immediately return calls seeking comment Wednesday. The other major recording companies have released some tracks without DRM hurdles online either as part of experiments or sales promotions. Still, they insist that safeguards are still needed to stave off online piracy and make other digital music business models work. IDC analyst Susan Kevorkian said she thinks Amazon.com could push the digital music market forward by pressuring more major music labels to sell DRM-free music. "We think Amazon's position in the market could be influential enough to move some if not all of the remaining majors toward offering MP3-encoded, DRM-free downloads," Kevorkian said. "The majors need to be looking at new ways and better ways to sell music to consumers because they're suffering substantial declines in their core CD business," Kevorkian added. Shares of Amazon.com rose 71 cents to $61.29 in midday trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, toward the high end of the company's stock price over the past year.

Nearly eight months after Google purchased YouTube for $1.65 billion, the video-sharing site is starting to show signs of developing a sustainable ad model. In its latest move, YouTube has struck a deal to create channels for five local broadcast stations owned by Hearst-Argyle. The companies will share ad revenue generated by news and other content. The effort comes as YouTube experiments with new ad formats. In a few tests, the company has begun inserting text-ad invitations to view long-form content into some clips. This would enable YouTube to offer the type of video advertising much in demand by marketers. For now, YouTube and Hearst-Argyle will split revenue generated from standard ad unit impressions. The companies did not disclose the revenue split. Both YouTube and Hearst-Argyle will sell ads for the channels. Hearst-Argyle stations in Boston, Manchester, N.H., Sacramento, Calif., Pittsburgh and Baltimore will participate. YouTube's head of premium content partnerships, Jordan Hoffner, said more of Hearst-Argyle's 26 stations could join the program down the line. "We know everything starts locally," Hoffner said. "Here is an opportunity to engage these content owners who produce a lot of content and enable them to utilize us as a distribution platform." After little initial progress, YouTube has begun to make headway in securing professional content for use on the site, which its executives see as a platform for both amateur and professional video creators to find audiences. Last week, it finalized a deal with EMI to post the music videos of that company's artists. It has also struck ad-revenue partnerships with a clutch of popular amateur YouTube creators. The company is also readying a content-identification system that it claims will make it easier for content companies to screen copyrighted content from the site&mdash;and also allow it to target ads. Hoffner said YouTube would eventually like to include video advertising with professionally produced content, but it has not settled on a method. "We're still looking at the optimal point for video ads in terms of placement and length," he said. "We want to see what the community of YouTube is going to embrace so it's something that's scalable."

The investment, together with $400m in new debt, will be used by Palm to fund a $9-a-share cash distribution to existing shareholders while leaving Palm with the resources that Ed Colligan, chief executive, says it needs to develop new products. Elevation will pay $8.50 a share for the stake, a 16 per cent premium to Palmâ€™s share price over the 10 trading days up to last Friday. Palm, which faces a declining market for its original personal digital assistants and growing competition in the fast-expanding smartphone market, has reshaped its board by appointing three Elevation representatives, two of whom are veterans of Apple. Jon Rubinstein, former senior vice-president of hardware engineering at and head of its iPod division, will join Palm as executive chairman. discusses Elevationâ€™s stake in Palm Fred Anderson, former chief financial officer at Apple, who is a co-founder and managing director of Elevation, will join the board, as will Roger McNamee, a managing director at the firm. â€œThis is a huge announcement and a tremendous opportunity,â€ said Mr McNamee, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and co-founder of Silver Lake Partners and Integral Capital. â€œIâ€™m a kid in a candy store right now.â€ Mr Rubinstein, Mr Anderson and Mr McNamee will replace Eric Benhamou and Scott Mercer, who will quit Palmâ€™s board. The new structure will give Elevation â€“ named after a U2 hit â€“ three of the nine board positions. Mr Rubinstein, who left Apple last year, helped develop the original iPod in 2001 and became head of the business when it was spun off as a separate division in 2004. He also led the team that built the iMac. The strategic recapitalisation coupled with the appointments come at a crucial time for Palm and should end speculation about its immediate future including rumours this year that it might be up for sale. â€œThis is by far the largest investment Elevation has ever made,â€ said Mr McNamee. â€œMobile [computing] is a monster wave and Palm is at the centre of it,â€ he said. â€œThe DNA of this company is all about breakthrough products.â€ The Financial Times Limited 2007 "Middle East" sub navigation "By sector" sub navigation "By region" sub navigation "Markets headlines" sub navigation "Market data" sub navigation Australia & New Zealand "Managed funds" sub navigation "Comment & Analysis" sub navigation Comment & Analysis main "Debates and polls" sub navigation Debates and polls main "Video & Audio" sub navigation Video & Audio main View from the Top "Business Life" sub navigation "Business education" sub navigation Features of the week "Your Money" sub navigation "Advice & comment" sub navigation Advice & comment main "Compare & apply" sub navigation Compare & apply main "Arts & Weekend" sub navigation Arts & Weekend main How to spend it "Weekend columnists" sub navigation "In depth" sub navigation "Special Reports" sub navigation Future of Europe 2007 "Jobs & classified" sub navigation Jobs & classified main "Services & tools" sub navigation Services & tools main "News tracking" sub navigation Minimum delay 15 minutes All times are London time Advertise with the FT The Financial Times Ltd 2007.

The statistics were part of an overall 1.3 percent rise in violent crime across the country in 2006, the second consecutive annual increase. Car thefts, arsons and other property crimes dipped for a second straight year, the data show. The modest increase in murders reflected a mixed bag for cities. The number of homicides in major metropolitan areas &#8212; those with at least 1 million residents &#8212; climbed by 6.7 percent. Smaller cities, meanwhile, saw their murders decrease by a collective 11.9 percent. The spike in robberies marked the largest increase in any category of crime surveyed in the FBI report, which was compiled with data from more than 11,700 law enforcement agencies nationwide. Huge setback to Bush&#x27;s military tribunals at Guant&#xE1;namo Efficient adoption system attracts American couples to Ethiopia JFK plot was short on means and smarts Violent crime rose in every region of the country except for the Northeast, the FBI reported. Western states saw the largest jump in violent crime, by 2.8 percent, the data show. The new numbers come amid a Justice Department push to tamp down violent crime with millions of dollars distributed to local police forces and a surge of federal agents to troubled cities. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who took office as violent crime started to rise, has called the crackdown one of his top priorities for the remaining 18 months of his tenure at the Justice Department. In a spot of good news, violent crime grew at a slower pace than had been expected. In December, the FBI projected a 3.7 percent increase for the first six months of 2006. The year before, in 2005, violent crime rose by 2.3 percent. Property crimes decreased overall by 2.9 percent from 2005, the FBI reported. Burglaries, however, rose slightly, particularly in mid-sized cities where the rate grew by 3.3 percent.

The description of plush furnishings in Black's apartment on New York's Upper East Side came as an expected appearance by real estate tycoon Donald Trump as a witness for the defence failed to materialize. Lawyers indicated that contrary to widespread reports circulating since last Friday, Trump wouldn't be called to the stand at the 12-week trial which is going into its final few days. Defence attorneys instead called Lee Williams, a former federal tax agent, who said his investigation showed that Black plunged $4.6 million into refurbishing the luxury co-op apartment â€“ double the amount prosecutors say can be proven. They also indicated they wanted to call Black's longtime associate David Radler, who worked with Black for more than 30 years but took the stand against him last month in exchange for a lenient sentence after pleading guilty to one count of fraud. Black, 62, and three other former executives of the Hollinger International newspaper empire are charged with swindling the company out of millions of dollars, largely through the sale of assets. Purchasers of hundreds of Hollinger community newspapers across the United States and Canada paid the company not to go into competition with them. Black and fellow executives got much of the money, which federal prosecutors say should have gone to shareholders. Black is also charged with bilking the company by taking the Hollinger jet on a vacation to Bora Bora in French Polynesia, billing shareholders $42,000 for his wife's birthday party at New York's swank restaurant La Grenouille and transactions involving the apartment. Black's defence attorneys have maintained that the birthday party was partially a business function and thus Hollinger should have picked up at least part of the tab. In fact, Black paid one-third and billed two-thirds of the cost of the party to the newspaper company. Trump, who was negotiating with Hollinger to buy the Chicago Sun-Times building at the time, was among the guests at the party and might have been expected to testify there was a business component to the affair. Apartment furnishings also pointed to a lavish lifestyle. Besides a $12,000 "three-drawer" commode and the $17,000 music system, there were $4,399 towel-holder bars, $17,710 Indian white marble elephants, $9,800 Louis XVI painted stools, a 1920s Chinese carpet for $33,000 and a porcelain bottle that belonged to Napoleon Bonaparte on his campaign in Russia along with a mahogany shaving stand for $12,500. A diamond vault cost $12,000 and Black paid $828 for sofa pillows plus two yards of silk, according to the list. It also included a Brussels carpet that cost $3,255, a mother of pearl Persian box valued at $9,600 and a $9,750 plaque depicting Amazon women. Prosecutor Eric Sussman also noted a bill for travel by architects to Palm Beach, Fla., where Black has another home. "These same architects were actually doing work for Mr. Black on his place down in Palm Beach?" Sussman asked. Williams said the documents appeared to suggest that they were. How much Black paid for capital improvements, furnishings and decorations for the apartment which occupies the entire third floor of a vintage building not far from Central Park is in dispute at the trial. Black lived in the apartment owned by the Hollinger International newspaper group for six years rent free when he was the company's CEO. When shareholders started to grumble that they shouldn't pay his rent, Black bought the apartment for $3 million â€“ the amount Hollinger paid for it six years earlier. Prosecutors say Black scammed the company because the apartment's value skyrocketed in six years. An appraiser who testified as a prosecution witness said the apartment was worth $8.5 million. But Black's lawyers claim the improvements he paid for out of his own pocket made up for the difference â€“ making the value of those improvements a key point of dispute at the trial. On Monday, they said wanted another chance to question Radler, citing new evidence that he lied when he testified against Black and asking the Chicago court "to require the government to produce F. David Radler for examination in the defence case." While on the stand, Radler professed to be telling the truth, but Black lawyer Eddie Greenspan suggested it was ludicrous for Radler to claim he was not aware of one of his plea bargain's best features â€“ that he would serve his term in a Canadian prison and under Canadian law is likely to serve only six months. In his filing Monday, Black lawyer Marc Martin said Radler ``professed ignorance" about the possibility of serving his time in Canada, as well as "Canadian parole rules governing release of white-collar prisoners after service of one-sixth of a sentence." Black's lawyers have since unearthed evidence that Radler had contacted a leading Canadian parole lawyer before making his plea arrangement with U.S. prosecutors. "That Mr. Radler has had the leading Canadian parole lawyer on his legal team since November 2004 is probative of his bias, motive and interest in testifying for the government," the court filing said. "It also impeaches his claims of ignorance about Canadian surrender and parole rules." Horse, heiress and a hurdle Charities worthy of donations Great home delivery subscription deals here!

The offer of $62 a share is $1.50 higher than the original agreement, Baltimore-based Laureate said today in a statement distributed by Business Wire. The new offer represents a premium of 14 percent over the share price of $54.41 on Jan. 26, the last trading day before Laureate first announced an agreement. Laureate, which offers campus- and Internet-based college degree programs, was facing criticism from stockholders including BlackRock Inc. that the original offer of $60.50 a share was too low. BlackRock joined T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Select Equity Group Inc. in saying it was concerned by how the deal was ``proposed and evaluated,&#39;&#39; according to a March 15 letter.

Under the deal, which was announced Monday, Palm will pay shareholders a special distribution of $9 per share -- a total of about $940 milion in cash. Palm shares added 1.34, or 8.3 percent, to $17.44 in trading Monday. The company also said former Apple Inc. hardware engineer Jon Rubenstein will become Palm's chairman. Rubenstein helped bring Apple's iMac computer to fruition and headed the company's iPod unit between 2004 and 2006. In addition, Palm said board members D. Scott Mercer and Eric Benhamou -- a former Palm chief executive -- will resign and Elevation partners Fred Anderson and Roger McNamee will become part of Palm's board.

Monday, 4th June 2007 Mon 4 Jun 2007 PartyGaming in U.S. crackdown talks LONDON (Reuters) - Online gambling firm PartyGaming said on Monday it was in talks with U.S. authorities following the recent spate of arrests of industry executives, after the U.S. effectively outlawed Internet gambling last year. PartyGaming said it had initiated talks with the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and had been responding to requests for information. It added that it was too early to assess the likelihood of any particular outcome of the discussions. The U.S. crackdown on online gaming began last July with the arrest of BETonSPORTS chief executive David Carruthers during a layover at a Texas airport. Last month BETonSPORTS pleaded guilty to U.S. racketeering charges and agreed to cooperate in a case against the company's founder Gary Kaplan and other co-defendants including Carruthers. In March Sportingbet brokered a deal with the state of Louisiana to have charges of "gambling by computer" against its former chairman, Peter Dicks, dropped. (c) Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Loews, the majority owner of Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., will pay about $4 billion for Dominion&#39;s operations in west Texas, Michigan and Alabama, the companies said in a statement today. Oil and gas producer XTO, based in Fort Worth, Texas, is buying deposits in Utah, New Mexico, southern Colorado and Louisiana, for about $2.5 billion. The sale includes reserves equal to about 3.5 trillion cubic feet of gas, enough to supply New York State for three years. Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion, the second-largest U.S. utility owner, put the oil and gas business up for sale in November to reduce debt and buy back stock. ``We&#39;ve been looking at this business for a long time, kicking a lot of tires,&#39;&#39; Loews Chief Executive Officer James Tisch said in an interview. Loews will keep the management of the exploration and production unit, he said, and consider additional acquisitions. Dominion CEO Thomas Farrell II is selling the assets to concentrate on the higher-growth electric utility business. Farrell also said today that the company expects 2008 operating earnings of $6 a share and at least 4 percent to 6 percent average annual earnings growth. Eni SpA, Italy&#39;s largest oil company, agreed in April to buy Dominion&#39;s offshore Gulf of Mexico oil and gas reserves for $4.8 billion. Two Canadian energy trusts last week agreed to pay $583 million for Dominion&#39;s deposits in Canada. Loews said it is paying about $1.64 per thousand cubic feet of natural gas. That&#39;s a good price compared with other recent transactions at $2.50 to $3 per thousand cubic feet, SunTrust Robinson oil and gas analyst John Gerdes said in an interview. Executives at Loews already ``have a pretty good insight into this business&#39;&#39; because of their drilling company and involvement in pipelines, said Steven McSorley, an analyst at Cathay Financial in New York, who rates Loews shares ``neutral&#39;&#39; and doesn&#39;t own any. While the company is using much of its cash on this, more oil and gas acquisitions are possible, he said. The Dominion acquisition is the biggest transaction for Loews since at least 1995. Since 2003, Loews acquired Gulf South Pipeline for $1.1 billion and Texas Gas Transmission LLC for $1 billion. The company was formed in 1945 when brothers Laurence and Preston Robert Tisch took over their father&#39;s resort business and formed Tisch Hotels. The company expanded their hotels business and then invested in tobacco and insurance with Lorillard Tobacco and CNA Financial Corp. Loews also owns watchmaker Bulova Corp., and has had a controlling stake in Diamond Offshore Drilling since 1989. Laurence Tisch died in 2003 at the age of 80. His son, James Tisch, 54, has been CEO since 1999. Preston Robert Tisch died in 2005. XTO Energy Chief Executive Officer Bob Simpson is using the company&#39;s biggest-ever acquisition to add to existing holdings in East Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming. The company had oil and gas reserves equal to about 8.55 trillion cubic feet of gas on Dec. 31. Gas accounted for 85 percent of the total. The company said it replaced 302 percent of the oil and gas it pumped last year. XTO said it is considering setting up a master limited partnership, with an initial capitalization of $500 million, to hold some of its oil and gas properties and provide greater value to investors because of the tax structure. U.S. oil and gas producers Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and Plains Exploration & Production Co. in April said they may form similar partnerships to take over some of their established fields. Such partnerships distribute most of their earnings to unit holders and are not subject to corporate taxation. Investors get higher cash payouts than a company would otherwise pay in dividends, and taxes on some of the income can be deferred. XTO shares jumped $3.18, or 5.5 percent, to $61.55 at 3 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They are up 46 percent in the past year, the most among the six members of the S&P 500 Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Index. Shares of XTO are up because of the news that they are considering an MLP, according to oil and gas analyst Fadel Gheit of Oppenheimer & Co. Gheit rates XTO stock a buy and doesn&#39;t own any. Shares of Dominion rose 48 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $88.12, while Loews gained 99 cents to a record $52.01. Dominion said it still plans to sell its mid-continent assets. These are primarily in Oklahoma and equal about 780 billion cubic feet of gas. The transaction should be completed by the end of this year. The company said it now has agreements covering about 85 percent of the reserves it plans to shed. The company is keeping some producing properties in Appalachia. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. are among the firms advising Dominion on the asset sales. Other utility companies also have been selling non-power businesses. Last year, Duke Energy Corp. spun off Spectra Energy Corp., a natural gas pipeline unit. In 2004, KeySpan Corp. sold its stake in oil and natural gas producer Houston Exploration Co. Dominion&#39;s shares have risen 18 percent in the past year, lagging behind the 25 percent gain for the Dow Jones Utilities Average, which has 15 members. Dominion said a year ago that investor concern about potential losses at the oil and gas business held down the share price. The divestures will leave Dominion as an owner of 7,800 miles of natural-gas pipelines, almost a quarter of U.S. natural gas storage, a natural-gas import terminal in Maryland, Virginia&#39;s biggest electric utility and power plants capable of generating 26,300 megawatts, enough to power 20.8 million U.S. homes based on U.S. Energy Department figures.

Servers & Data Center Yahoo opens access to ad system APIs By Juan Carlos Perez, IDG News Service, 06/04/07 Yahoo Inc. is making APIs (application programming interfaces) available for external developers so that they can build tools and applications for its new Panama search advertising platform. Other stories on this topic With Yahoo deal off, what next for Microsoft? McAfee: Search results can be dangerous Humans get bigger role in search Better data center management with virtualization. Howard Anderson says online gaming could be the killer app for convergence. Vyatta targets Cisco channel with new open-source networking partner program CCIE job openings in Boston, Morristown NJ, New York City and Philadelphia SecureCRT best terminal emulator? The APIs, available under the Yahoo Search Marketing Commercial API Program, are available to anyone but designed primarily for Yahoo search advertisers, ad agencies, search marketing consultants and commercial application developers, Yahoo said Monday. Yahoo wants these companies to develop complementary tools and applications that will enhance their use and their clients' use of Panama for tasks like designing, deploying, tracking, managing and refining search marketing campaigns. Yahoo has high hopes that Panama will help boost revenue from search engine advertising, a market dominated by rival Google Inc. Yahoo maintains that Panama significantly improves on its ability to match ads to search queries, and is convinced that this improved targeting will increase the number of times users click on its search engine pay-per-click ads. While ad-serving enhancements are certainly important for Yahoo to improve its position against Google, Panama doesn't directly address the other big component of search wars: user popularity. Google still draws significantly more users to its search engines than Yahoo does, so Google's ads are seen by more people and as such are more likely to get clicked on. For example, in April, U.S. users ran almost half of all queries through Google's search engines, while Yahoo processed almost 27 percent, according to comScore Networks Inc. In total numbers, this means that Google had 3.6 billion queries on its search engines and Yahoo had 2 billion. Thus, in addition to improving its ad system, Yahoo needs to cut that popularity gap if it wants to significantly raise its search ad revenue. Different levels of access to the Panama APIs exist, both free and fee-based.

The acquisition, if approved by shareholders, will create the second-largest contract manufacturer - companies that make money by assembling products for technology concerns such as Hewlett-Packard or Cisco Systems. The transaction will create a company that more than &#36;30 billion in revenue, 200,000 employees and about 150 manufacturing sites. Since the 2001 downturn, contract manufacturers have been attempting to work off excess production capacity added during the boom years. The combination of the two firms, which will consolidate their capacity, "is good for the industry," said Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.

Salem-News.com is the Publisher of Frontline-News United Food Group Recalls 75,000 Pounds Of Ground Beef Due To Possible E. coli Contamination Oregon is one of 11 states involved in the ground beef E. coli recall. United Food Group's 24-hour toll-free hotline at (800) 325-4164. (VERNON, Calif.) - United Food Group LLC in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is conducting a voluntary recall of 75,000 pounds of ground beef that is believed to be contaminated with the E. coli 0157:H7 bacteria. The fresh ground beef chubs subject to recall were produced at United Food Group's facility in Vernon on April 20th, and were distributed under the brand names Moran's All Natural, Stater Bros., and Inter-American Products, Inc. The recalled products were available at Albertson's, Grocery Outlet, Fry's, Save-A-Lot, Save-Mart, Smart and Final, Smith's, and Stater Bros., in 11 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming and Montana. Stores in the 11 states confirmed that none of the recalled product remains available for sale and all products currently in stock are not part of the recalled product. Consumers in the 11 states who may be concerned about Moran's All Natural ground beef, Stater Bros., and Inter-American Products Inc. fresh chubs may contact United Food Group's 24-hour toll-free hotline at (800) 325-4164 for assistance. "Our company's paramount concern is for the safety and health of consumers who have purchased our products, and we have been working closely with the USDA to ensure that the recall is completed successfully," said Todd Waldman, senior vice president for United Food Group. "Given our long history of focusing on product safety and our standards of excellence, we will err on the side of being cautious with this recall." Consumers are reminded that ground beef cooked to an internal temperature of at least 160 degrees F will kill harmful bacteria and is safe to eat. The best way to be sure ground beef is properly cooked is to use an accurate food thermometer.

Flextronics to buy Solectron for $3.6B Flextronics sees benefits in its product development, supply chain processes A Mission-Critical Webcast for Manufacturer IT from Novell: "The Lean Data Center" Case Study: A manufacturing SMB Gets Improved IT capabilities as well as savings Business Service Management Trends: How a CMDB Drives IT-Business Alignment 15 Minute Guide: Transactional Content Management Success Apparel Success Story VoIP: Coming in Loud and Clear The Frenetic Pace of Wireless Sign up to receive Security Resource Alerts (IDG News Service) -- plans to acquire rival Solectron Corp. to create an electronics manufacturing services powerhouse with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, Flextronics said today. Singapore-based Flextronics would acquire Milpitas, Calif.-based Solectron in a stock and cash deal worth about $3.6 billion. The combined company would operate in 35 countries, with a combined employee base of about 200,000 people, including about 4,000 design engineers, Flextronics said in a press release. Both companies provide contract manufacturing services to a variety of industries. Flextronics focuses on electronics design, engineering and manufacturing services to manufacturers serving the automotive, computing, consumer digital and medical industries. Solectron focuses on design, supply chain management and product warranty repair services to companies serving the networking, telecommunications, computing, storage, automotive, medical and defense industries. The deal will help the two companies improve their product development processes and supply chain management, Flextronics said. Solectron's strength in high-end computing and telecommunications will be an "invaluable addition" to Flextronics, Flextronics CEO Mike McNamara said in a statement. "We will be a larger, more competitive company and therefore better positioned to deliver supply chain solutions that fulfill our customers' increasingly complex requirements," he added. In February, Solectron's CEO Michael Cannon resigned to join as president of global operations. The merger is expected to close by the end of the year. The deal needs approval from shareholders from both companies as well as possible regulatory approvals, Flextronics said. Reprinted with permission from Story copyright 2006 International Data Group.

But the prosecution, which wrapped up its case last week, constructed a solid argument that Black and three co-defendants at former Chicago-based media giant Hollinger International Inc. committed a $60 million fraud and abused company perks. "There were no smoking gun documents. But this is the case they were dealt and I think the prosecution did a very good job," said Hugh Totten, an attorney who handles white collar criminal defense cases and has attended parts of the trial in U.S. District Court. The Canadian-born Black, 62, faces 13 counts of fraud, tax evasion, obstructing justice and racketeering, charges that could send him to jail for 101 years and penalize him with millions of dollars in fines and forfeitures. One count of money laundering against Black, who built and then dismantled one of the world's largest newspaper publishing empires and became a globe-trotting celebrity and a member of Britain's House of Lords in the process, was dropped without comment by prosecutors. Two of the other co-defendants, both Canadian, are charged with illegally diverting money to themselves and to Black with the help of Hollinger's corporate counsel, an American who is also on trial. Hollinger is now called the Sun-Times Media Group The prosecution's least impeachable witnesses came at the beginning and the end of its case -- with troubling star witness David Radler in the middle, court observers said. Radler, who built Hollinger International with Black over more than three decades, has pleaded guilty and agreed to testify in exchange for a lesser sentence to be served in his native Canada. His testimony placed Black behind the scheme, recounting a phone call where Black declared the two partners could divert money to themselves through so-called non-competition agreements. Prosecutors charge that Black and the others used the non-compete agreements -- assurances made to buyers of Hollinger newspaper properties that sellers would not compete against them in a given market -- to pay themselves tax-free bonuses. Defense lawyers attacked Radler's credibility, given past lies that he admitted to telling government investigators during what he referred to on the stand as his "rationalization phase." "He (Radler) was a little flaky, but he was also legitimately asking questions of his questioners," Totten said. The defense also sought to show Black and Radler operated in separate spheres, with Black focused on London's Daily Telegraph and the National Post, his Canadian creation -- both since sold. Radler, meanwhile, concentrated on the Chicago Sun-Times and hundreds of smaller newspaper properties. The closest thing the much ballyhooed trial has seen to celebrity witnesses were the high-profile members of Hollinger's former audit committee led by past Illinois Gov. James Thompson. White collar criminal defense attorney Rebekah Poston, who has followed the trial, said those witnesses did not fare well for the prosecution, and lent credence to the other side. "I found the most amazing and really the strongest witnesses for the defense ended up being the government's witnesses: the guys on the audit committee," she said. Totten added that Thompson in particular was "pummeled" by the defense for toeing whatever line Hollinger executives asked him to and for admitting to "skimming" company documents that he should have read in his role as board member. The directors were needed to nail down a key plank of the prosecution's case: that even when payments were disclosed in company filings, the disclosures were misleading because they said the buyers had requested the non-compete agreements. Several newspaper executives testified they did not request them of the Hollinger executives. Defense lawyers countered that Hollinger's outside lawyers and accountants either sanctioned or did not question the suspect payments. The defense also poked holes in accusations that Black siphoned company funds for a South Seas vacation, a birthday party for his wife, and a New York apartment by eliciting testimony that he worked constantly and that his lavish spending served many purposes. Another prosecution theme was Black's eloquent defense of his exalted status at the company and his contempt for restive shareholders. It was displayed through correspondence read to jurors and in audio recordings of two annual meetings. Still to come is the bulk of the defense case, which may last only a week longer, with none of the four defendants considered likely to testify. "The only way you'll see Black testify in this case is if one of the other defendants testifies," Totten said. The defense has indicated it will show that non-compete agreements are standard in the newspaper industry. (c) Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Uranium One acquires Energy Metals Mon, 04 Jun 2007 South African and Canadian listed mining group Uranium One announced on Monday that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Energy Metals Corporation. In a statement, Uranium One said the acquisition will dramatically enhance the group's asset portfolio in the United States and solidify the new Uranium One's ability to build a leading US uranium producer. Under the terms of the agreement, EMC shareholders will receive 1.15 common shares of Uranium One for each issued share of EMC, representing a value of C$19.12 per share based upon the closing price of Uranium One on the TSX on 1 June 2007. This represents a 28 percent premium to the 20-day volume weighted average trading prices of Uranium One's and EMC's shares on the TSX for the period ending 17 May 2007, the day before EMC announced that it had entered into exclusive negotiations with respect to a potential sale of the company. "The acquisition of EMC is consistent with Uranium One's value-accretive external growth strategy and will consolidate Uranium One's position in the United States," Uranium One said. It added that on a pro forma basis, the group will have a fully diluted market capitalisation of $7.8-billion and improved liquidity as well as a strong balance sheet with a combined cash balance of $678-million. The group will also have a balanced and geographically diversified portfolio of reserves and resources, with the second largest uranium reserve and resource base in the world in terms of publicly traded, pure play uranium companies. Commenting on the proposed acquisition, Neal Froneman, Uranium One president and CEO said: "With our solid position in Kazakhstan and South Africa, the acquisition of EMC fits in perfectly with our stated strategy of value-accretive external growth and our focus on growth in the United States. Creating a diversified portfolio “The combination of Uranium One and EMC will create a powerhouse in the United States uranium sector with the potential to become the domestic supplier of choice for US utilities. Our combined portfolio of assets will be geographically diversified, with assets in the world's top five uranium jurisdictions. The existing conventional mining and ISR expertise within Uranium One, coupled with the excellent technical team that EMC has built over the past several years will result in one of the industry's leading technical teams, with the necessary expertise to deliver on development and growth opportunities in the United States." Paul Matysek, President and CEO of EMC added: "The transaction provides our shareholders immediate exposure to uranium production and cash flow, while at the same time creating new avenues for growth. “The addition of Uranium One's technical team will augment our elite ISR staff and provide us with the ability to develop our US conventional uranium assets, which are incremental to our current growth strategy. The new Uranium One's significant resource base, strong balance sheet and proven management team will ensure that the company becomes one of the world's leading diversified uranium producers. My colleagues and I at EMC look forward to continuing to play an important role in what I believe to be the fastest growing and most dynamic uranium company in the world." On completion of the transaction, it is expected that current Uranium One shareholders will own approximately 79 percent of the combined company and current EMC shareholders will own approximately 21 percent.

The two private equity firms appear to have bested a rival bid from Nortel Networks and a deal may be announced Monday, those people said. But they cautioned that the talks were ongoing and that Nortel could still make a higher bid. The firms are expected to pay about $17 a share, the people said. Avaya&#039;s shares closed Friday at $16.08, and in afternoon trading Monday, they were up 68 cents at $16.76. Speculation about a buyout first arose two weeks ago, when the company unexpectedly postponed a meeting with analysts without offering an explanation or setting a new date. An Avaya spokeswoman declined to comment. Avaya, which was once part of Lucent Technologies and AT&#038;T before that, is one of the top U.S. makers of phone equipment, rivaling Cisco, Nortel and Alcatel-Lucent in providing Internet-based communications to corporations. Much of its business focuses on upgrading companies to voice networks that include video and data services.

But its financial health has rebounded so strongly that a Merrill Lynch analyst recently described Avaya as an ideal buyout candidate. The move comes amid heavy deal-making in the telecommunications sector. Last month, Alltel, the wireless service provider, agreed to a $27.5 billion buyout by TPG, formerly called Texas Pacific Group, and a unit of Goldman Sachs.

(TSX:SXR) says its $1.6-billion deal to take over Energy Metals Corp (TSX:EMC) will give it a production forecast to rival that of industry leader Cameco by 2013. The arrangement - exchanging 1.15 shares of Uranium One for each Energy Metals share - continues a series of acquisitions for the South-Africa based company that will create a "powerhouse" in the United States uranium sector, said Neal Froneman, Uranium One's chief executive officer. The company said Monday it expects to produce about 28 million pounds of uranium, used to fuel nuclear power plants, by 2013. Of that, about 25 per cent is expected to come from the company's new mine in South Africa, Dominion Reefs. Uranium One said Cameco's (TSX:CCO)production forecast is for more than 27 million pounds by 2011. "This will enhance Uranium One's unrivalled production growth profile," Froneman said on a conference call with analysts Monday. "This will go a long way toward our strategy of producing U.S. uranium for U.S. utilities." Froneman said the U.S. has 103 nuclear facilities with an annual demand of about 50 million pounds per year. But domestic production is only about four million pounds per year, he said. The deal's value, based on Uranium One's closing share price of $16.63 on Friday, represents a 28 per cent premium over the 20-day average before Energy Metals announced May 18 it was in talks for a sale. Energy Metals stockholders will own 21 per cent of the combined enterprise, which Uranium One said will have a market capitalization of US$7.8 billion. "This is a win-win for both groups of shareholders," Froneman said. "This transaction results in a powerhouse in the United States uranium sector." Froneman said the company is poised to profit from a shift in American attitudes towards nuclear power, as the country seeks to reduce its reliance on foreign energy sources. "There are clear signs of a nuclear renaissance in the United States," he said. The boards of both companies have approved the deal, Energy Metals shareholders are to vote on it in late July and it's expected to close in August. Energy Metals has agreed to pay a break fee of C$55 million if another bidder prevails. The deal follows a series of deal pursued by Uranium One as it seeks to position itself as a leading global uranium producer. The company completed a $3.2-billion stock-swap takeover of uranium producer UrAsia Energy Ltd. in April, and also issued 6.6 million shares to U.S. Energy Corp. in exchange for the Shootaring Canyon uranium mill in Utah and a large package of land in Utah, Wyoming, Arizona and Colorado. The company, which posted a loss last month of US$3.8 million for the first quarter ending March 31, is active in exploration and development of uranium and gold properties in South Africa, Australia and Canada. Sxr Uranium One shares were down 38 cents or 2.3 per cent to $16.25 Monday morning on the TSX, while EMC shares were up 31 cents or 1.7 per cent to $18.60. &copy; The Canadian Press, 2007 Defence requests recall of Radler at Conrad Black trial Key prosecution witness David Radler could be recalled to the stand at the Conrad Black fraud trial, if the defence has its way.

Bookings increased 0.3 percent, following a 4.1 percent gain in March, the Commerce Department said today in Washington. Excluding transportation equipment, orders gained 0.7 percent after a 2.4 percent gain in March. The slowdown in orders may be temporary, economists said. Demand is likely to pick up as the economy recovers from the slowest expansion in more than four years, they added. The signs of a rebound in business spending are consistent with the Federal Reserve&#39;s projection of faster growth later this year and into 2008. ``There&#39;s been a lot of concern about business spending, but it seems like we&#39;re slowly inching away from the cliff,&#39;&#39; said Drew Matus, a senior economist at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in New York. ``These numbers support the idea of better growth in the second quarter, and if this continues it supports the Fed&#39;s view of a better second half.&#39;&#39; After the report, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 2 basis points to 4.93 percent as of 11:57 a.m. in Washington. Stocks and the dollar were little changed. Factory orders were forecast to rise 0.7 percent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 66 economists. Forecasts of the gain in orders ranged from 0.2 percent to 2 percent. Orders for durable goods, which make up about 55 percent of factory demand, rose a revised 0.8 percent after a 5.1 percent increase in March. The government last week, in a preliminary estimate, reported a 0.6 percent rise in durables orders. Orders for capital goods excluding aircraft and military equipment, a measure of future business investment, increased 2.1 percent after a 4.6 percent gain. The Commerce Department had previously estimated a 1.2 percent gain. Shipments of these goods, part of the government&#39;s calculation of gross domestic product, rose 1.0 percent after rising 1.6 percent. Civilian aircraft orders fell 10.7 percent after gaining 53.6 percent in March. Bookings for machinery fell 1.5 percent after rising 5.4 percent, today&#39;s report said. Primary metals orders rose 3.9 percent after rising 5.8 percent. Orders for computers and electronic products rose 1.8 percent after falling 1.3 percent. Bookings for automobiles fell 2.7 percent after gaining 2.4 percent. Bookings for non-durable goods, including food, petroleum and chemicals, fell 0.2 percent in April after rising 2.9 percent in March. Orders of non-durable consumer goods, which includes apparel, food and beverages, fell 1 percent after a 4 percent gain. Inventories at factories rose 0.5 percent, the biggest gain since September, and have increased in 13 of the last 14 months, Commerce Department figures showed. Today&#39;s report showed businesses had enough goods to last 1.24 months at April&#39;s sales pace, down from 1.25 months. Other reports in recent weeks have shown strengthening in manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy. Orders for durable goods, which make up almost 60 percent of factory orders, rose 0.6 percent in April after a 5 percent gain in March, the government reported May 24. The Institute for Supply Management&#39;s manufacturing index rose in May to the highest in 13 months while its production index rose to the highest since February 2006, the Tempe, Arizona-based group reported June 1. The inventory index showed continued liquidation of stockpiles. ``People are still liquidating inventories,&#39;&#39; said Norbert Ore, chairman of the ISM survey, in a conference call from Atlanta. ``It could be that we overshot the mark on inventories.&#39;&#39; The previous day, the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago reported that its business barometer rose more than forecast in May, while its production index rose to the highest in more than two years. Spending on equipment and software rose at a 2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, after a 4.8 percent rate of decline in the final three months of 2006, the Commerce Department said last week. That was a bright spot in a report that showed first-quarter growth slowed to a 0.6 percent pace. Fed policy makers predict business spending will pick up as economic growth accelerates. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast growth of 2.2 percent in the second quarter and 2.5 percent in the July-to-September period. ``The growth of business fixed investment seemed most likely to move higher in coming quarters, supported by strong corporate balance sheets and profits,&#39;&#39; said minutes of the Fed&#39;s May 9 meeting released last week. Aircraft and car makers are profiting from demand from overseas and a dollar that has weakened by a fifth since early 2002. General Motors Corp. plans to increase sales outside the U.S. to more than 60 percent of the company&#39;s total, as its domestic sales decline. GM expects to sell 9.2 million vehicles worldwide this year, company sales analyst Paul Ballew said a conference call from New York on May 4. That would be Detroit-based GM&#39;s highest total since 9.55 million in 1978. ``We will do well over 5 million units this year outside the U.S. market,&#39;&#39; he said. ``That will be an all-time record for us.&#39;&#39; Last year, such sales totaled 4.2 million.

"The rotten old bastard intends to charm them all with his lies," warned media critic Jack Shafer. The idea that Murdoch might get his mitts on the has folks scandalized, as though Larry Flynt were buying the New York City Ballet. Is the Wall Street Journal Worth It? Rupert Murdoch makes a big bid for the newspaper's parent company. It's not a sign of improving fortunes for beleaguered dailies, but evidence of why the Journal is unique 10 Questions for Rupert Murdoch What's missing from this picture is the true villain. If Murdoch wins Dow Jones, it won't be because he's evil. It will be the result of decades of mismanagement of one of the world's great sources of news and analysis. All the 's Pulitzer Prizes can't mask the fact that, while demand for high-quality financial and political news exploded, the value of America's leading business newspaper first sank, then stagnated. Wall Street's judgment on Dow Jones ownership is pitiless. Investors in Murdoch's News Corporation hardly batted an eye when the old man bid $60 a share for a company that has been south of $40 a share for years. That enormous premium is the financial community's rough measure of the value of new management. The litany of Dow Jones stumbles and fumbles is well-known. As the hands-off Bancrofts watched from a distance, the company failed to move nimbly into the digital age. A single able entrepreneur, Michael Bloomberg, captured the desktop financial analysis business as Dow Jones dawdled. Meanwhile, a newspaper with huge circulation (over two million) and a relatively small staff (half the size of the Los Angeles ) for some reason lagged the industry in profitability. We journalists have a way of making heroes out of poor managers, as long as they lavishly publish our peerless prose. I've been guilty of it myself. I owe my early career to the largesse of Otis Chandler's Times-Mirror Co. and Alvah Chapman's Knight-Ridder. Believe me, those were swell times. And I watched some great journalism being done&#151;but upstairs those companies were failing to defend their market positions and misunderstanding the future. Neither of those companies exists any longer, and that great journalism is threatened because of it. In the weeks since Murdoch made his bid for Dow Jones, a number of writers have asserted that the lags precisely because it is so good&#151;that excellence is expensive and high-quality journalism cannot turn a good profit in a competitive era. There are at least two problems with this argument. First, it's dangerous. If journalists don't have faith in the value of our product, why should anyone else? The craft of Franklin, Pulitzer and Graham is too vital to be reduced to a charity case. Second, it's wrong. Operations as diverse as the and Bloomberg's news service have all managed (through various ups and downs in a turbulent business) to strengthen their journalism while improving their financial performance. It isn't easy. The way forward may not be entirely clear. But discipline and vision are what good management is all about, and in the long run we'd be better off to embrace these qualities than to pin our futures on amiable incompetence.

June 4 2007: 12:40 PM EDT NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- The Dow industrials slipped Monday afternoon, one session after it closed at a record high, but the broader market was mixed as investors eyed a big selloff in Chinese stocks, higher oil prices and a weaker-than-expected rise in April factory orders. The Dow Jones industrial average (down 18.94 to 13,649.17, ) lost a few points nearly 3 hours into the session after ending at an all-time high last Friday. The broader S&P 500 index (up 0.43 to 1,536.77, ) was little changed after ending at an all-time high Friday, marking the index's third record close in a row. The Nasdaq composite (down 1.98 to 2,611.94, ) also lost a couple of points, after ending at a new six-year high Friday. Upbeat economic news helped boost stocks last week, with the Dow and S&P 500 ending higher for the 8th out of 9 weeks. After such a run, stocks struggled Monday as investors weighed weaker international markets and sliding with the day's barrage of mergers news and rumors. slumped 8.3 percent slump overnight, adding to declines over the last week as the Chinese government has tried to slow the booming market. That sent European shares a bit lower Monday and also dragged a bit on U.S. stocks. However, any weakness in U.S. markets Monday was minimal compared to Feb. 27, when a 9 percent decrease in Chinese stocks sent stocks around the globe tumbling. On that day, the Dow lost 416 points and saw its biggest one-day point loss in 5-1/2 years. "People are feeling like they've seen this before, so it doesn't have the same impact," said Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading.. "In February, it was an unexpected event." In addition to the China news, stock investors were keeping an eye on rising oil prices, which jumped amid concerns about a cyclone approaching the Gulf of Mexico. Higher oil prices had a mixed impact on Wall Street Monday, with U.S. light crude for July delivery adding $1.17 to $66.25 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On the upside, the jump in oil prices gave a boost to (up $0.70 to $76.58, (up $2.95 to $84.06, (up $0.86 to $68.47, ) and other oil services companies. (up $1.38 to $50.85, ) gained nearly 3 percent after J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and others their ratings on the company.

Defence lawyers have been focusing on company perks that Black is accused of abusing and Trump is expected to testify about a dinner that was charged to Hollinger International. Prosecutors say it's an example of Black's disregard for shareholders. Defence lawyers say it was partly a business event - and point to Trump as proof of that claim. The tycoon was negotiating to buy the Chicago Sun-Times building from Hollinger when he attended the party. Before Black's lawyers call any new witnesses, they will finish their cross-examination of Maclean's editor Ken Whyte. &copy; The Canadian Press, 2007 Defence requests recall of Radler at Conrad Black trial Key prosecution witness David Radler could be recalled to the stand at the Conrad Black fraud trial, if the defence has its way.

Avaya shareholders will receive about $17 a share, the Times said, citing unidentified people familiar with the transaction. That&#39;s 5.7 percent more than Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based Avaya&#39;s closing price on June 1, and 24 percent more than the price before speculation about the purchase surfaced. The deal would give the buyout firms the world&#39;s biggest maker of corporate phone equipment, going head to head with Cisco Systems Inc. in the $5 billion market for Web-based gear. The acquisition also would mark private equity&#39;s latest dive into the technology and communications industry, following deals last month for Acxiom Corp., Alltel Corp. and CDW Corp. ``You&#39;ve got one or two strategic buyers and a couple of private-equity buyers looking at the asset and trying to see if it makes sense for them,&#39;&#39; Prudential Equity Group analyst Inder Singh said in an interview today. ``For private equity, it makes sense from a financial standpoint because Avaya is a fairly strong cash generator.&#39;&#39; Avaya spokeswoman Lynn Newman said the company doesn&#39;t comment on rumors or speculation. Shares of Avaya jumped 64 cents, or 4 percent, to $16.72 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They climbed 15 percent on May 29 after the Wall Street Journal reported that Avaya was in talks with Silver Lake. Takeover speculation began building last month when Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Tal Liani said in a report that Avaya would be a ``perfect&#39;&#39; buyout candidate because of its improving cash flow and profit margins. The company then canceled an analysts&#39; day scheduled for May 31. ``That&#39;s when it really came to the spotlight,&#39;&#39; said William Choi, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. in New York, who rates Avaya shares ``hold.&#39;&#39; He said Nortel Networks Corp., North America&#39;s largest maker of phone gear, was involved in talks with Avaya in early May. Nortel spokesman Jay Barta declined to comment. Buyout firms globally have engaged in 993 deals this year valued at about $450 billion, according to Bloomberg data, following last year&#39;s record $701.5 billion. TPG, formerly Texas Pacific Group, was founded in 1992 by David Bonderman, 64, James Coulter, 47, and Bill Price, 51. The Fort Worth, Texas-based firm raised $15 billion last year. The firm and Silver Lake bought Sabre Holdings Inc., the owner of tourism Web site Travelocity.com, this year for $4.4 billion. They also helped make up the group that bought financial software and services provider SunGard Data Systems Inc. in July 2005 for $11.3 billion. Silver Lake, founded in 1999, is the largest buyout fund to focus on technology. The company disclosed plans in January to raise as much as $10 billion for a new fund. Acxiom, a provider of computer and database services, said May 16 it&#39;s being acquired by Silver Lake and ValueAct Capital Partners LP for about $2.24 billion. Alltel, the fifth-biggest U.S. wireless service, agreed May 21 to be bought by TPG Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for $27.5 billion. Madison Dearborn Partners LLC agreed on May 30 to buy computer reseller CDW for $7.3 billion. Avaya generated $205 million in operating cash in the fiscal second quarter and had cash and equivalents totaling $829 million at the end of March. Another attractive quality is that the company is debt free, Liani wrote. Avaya regained the top spot in the Web-based corporate phone equipment market in the first quarter with 25.3 percent, compared with Cisco&#39;s 25.2 percent. Second-quarter profit soared 50 percent to $38 million, or 8 cents a share, after severance costs dwindled, the company said in April. Sales increased 4.5 percent to $1.29 billion. Profit and revenue growth at Avaya have been trumped by San Jose, California-based Cisco, which entered the phone equipment market eight years ago. Unlike Cisco, Avaya is saddled with older, traditional phone systems, which have seen declining sales as clients upgrade to faster Web equipment. Avaya first sold shares to the public in September 2000, after being spun off from Lucent Technologies Inc., which wanted to focus on its fiber-optic and Internet equipment business. The shares peaked that month and then tumbled as the technology bubble burst. The company lost 95 percent of its stock market value before bottoming out in August 2002. Donald Peterson, a 10-year veteran of the old AT&T Corp. and Lucent, led Avaya through the IPO and held the position of chief executive officer until he was replaced last July by Louis D&#39;Ambrosio as part of a management shake-up. D&#39;Ambrosio joined the company in December 2002 after 16 years at International Business Machines Corp.

The recapitalization deal will also bring fresh talent to the company's management ranks - mostly from red-hot consumer electronics maker Apple Inc. As part of the deal, former Apple senior vice president Jon Rubinstein will become executive chairman at Palm . At Apple, Rubinstein was a key executive in the development of the company's popular iPod digital music player as well as the company's line of iMac computers. Fred Anderson, former CFO of Apple and a managing director at Elevation, will also join Palm's board of directors, as well as Elevation co-founder Roger McNamee. "We believe this strategic recapitalization with Elevation Partners will enable us to take maximum advantage of the huge market opportunity in front of us," Palm CEO Ed Colligan said in a conference call. "It will allow us to attract the best and brightest talent to create the most compelling mobile computing solutions, and is the most effective way to manage our balance sheet." Takeover speculation pumps stock price The deal comes after months of market speculation that Palm was negotiating a takeover deal. Rumors had the smartphone maker being bought out by larger wireless device makers such as Motorola Rumors of buyout deal drove shares of Palm up nearly 40% from late January to mid-March, when the stock peaked at $19.50. Speculation began to cool following the company's earnings report for its third fiscal quarter. On a conference call, executives said they were running the business with the intention of remaining independent. On Monday, shares of Palm closed trading up more than 9% at $17.57. Under the terms of the deal, Elevation will invest $325 million into Palm. Using those funds plus another $440 million in debt, Palm will give shareholders a $9-per-share cash distribution. The deal values Palm shares at $17.50, when you add the cash distribution to the $8.50 conversion price for Elevation. Seeing opportunity in software Palm, which pioneered the PDA market with its self-named device, was also an early mover in the smartphone market with its Treo product line. But the company faces heavy competition in the space from large, deep-pocketed rivals such as Nokia and Motorola as well as upstart Research in Motion , whose BlackBerry wireless e-mail device has proved particularly popular with the corporate crowd. In addition, Apple will be launching its much-anticipated iPhone on June 29. The touch-screen smartphone will be available through an exclusive deal with AT&T. As a result of the competition, Wall Street has become lukewarm on Palm, waiting to see if it can update its product line to win over more customers. Reaction among investors was tepid last week after the company unveiled its latest product - a laptop-like e-mail device called Foleo that is designed for wireless e-mail users who need a larger screen. For its part, Elevation believes that smartphones will soon hit a limit on how small and thin they can be without sacrificing functionality. So the advantage in the future will come from the software side. "If the devices get any smaller they will be unusable," McNamee of Elevation said during the call. "Palm will close that gap, we believe, relatively soon. At which point, we think the game is all about software, and we think software is the place where this company truly excels." McNamee pointed out that this was the largest investment to date by Elevation, which was formed in 2005 and boasts the membership of several Silicon Valley heavyweights as well as Bono, lead singer of the popular rock band U2. Wall Street remains cautious Andrew Neff of Bear Stearns removed his bearish underperform rating on Palm, upgrading the stock to peer perform, on news of the deal. Though he conceded that the company still faces challenges in the market. "Fundamentally, Palm faces numerous challenges with intense competition in its phone business, a decline in its old handheld business and the lackluster response to the new product demo'd last week," Neff wrote in a note to clients. "We are raising our rating to reflect our view that the private equity involvement will shift the valuation focus away from some of those near-term concerns." A more bullish view came from Jonathan Hoopes of ThinkEquity, who rates the stock as a buy. In a note, Hoopes compared the company to Apple prior to the development of products such as the iMac and iPod, which reinvigorated the company's business. "Today's deal should quiet skeptics as these new investors in Palm have 'been around the block' and clearly understand the value of a global brand, of a foundation based on software, and of design acumen," Hoopes wrote. Tim Long of Banc of America Securities kept his neutral rating on the stock. "We believe adding new management is an encouraging sign, but the impact of any changes would not likely impact results until next year, at the earliest," he wrote in a note.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was recently off 32.25 points to 13635.76, with 22 of its 30 components retreating, led by Coca Cola Co. (KO), McDonald's Corp. (MCD) and Procter & Gamble Co. (PG). Bucking the trend among blue chips, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) rose 3%. The stock was upgraded by JP Morgan, HSBC, Wachovia and Morgan Stanley following the retail giant's shareholder meeting, where it revealed plans to cut capital spending and return more cash to shareholders. General Electric Co. (GE) also rose 1.3% after a Barron's article outlined the case for breaking up the juggernaut multinational. The S&P 500 index fell 1.69 points to 1534.65, while the Nasdaq Composite eased 5.44 points to 2608.48. Deal-making news, including Flextronics International Ltd.'s (FLEX) agreement to buy Solectron Corp. (SLR) for $3.6 billion, provided some support for tech shares and the broad market in early action. Palm (PALM) jumped 7.2% after agreeing to sell 25% of the firm to a private-equity firm for $325 million. The mild dip in U.S. trading signaled that investors aren't overly worried about yet another stumble in the Shanghai stock market. In spite of an 8% battering in Shanghai, other Asian markets recovered, including the Hang Seng in Hong Kong and the Nikkei in Tokyo. A tumble in the Chinese stock market last week was followed by rally on Wall Street the next day. When Shanghai fell sharply in late February, the Dow industrials plunged 416 points. But since then, U.S. stocks have staged an impressive rally. Through May alone, the Dow gained 4.3%, the S&P advanced 3.2% and the Nasdaq gained 3.1%. Last week, a slew of better-than-expected data, including the May employment report, boosted confidence in the economy and helped the Dow gain 1.2%, the S&P 1.4% and the Nasdaq 2.2%. Yet, strong data also pressured bond prices, pushing their yields, which move inversely to price, much higher. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note surpassed 5%, its highest level since mid-August. On Monday, the 10-year note rose 1/32 to 96 16/32, while its yield fell to 4.95%, amid safe-haven buying from the Shanghai sell off. Should U.S. stocks finally halt their impressive rally this week, "it will either be that investors turn their attention to rocketing interest rates or it will have to come from Wednesday's economic release on productivity and unit labor costs," said Marc Pado, market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. There was limited reaction to news that factor orders rose 0.3% in April, below the 0.8% expected by economists surveyed by MarketWatch. Orders in March were revised up to 4.1% from 3.5% previously, putting the level of orders close to expectations. The government also said businesses boosted their capital spending in April at a faster pace than previously reported. After the data, the dollar remained weaker against rivals. Crude-oil prices rose 51 cents to $65.59 amid concerns that a tropical cyclone might enter the Persian Gulf on Wednesday. Gold prices also rose as crude oil advanced and the dollar fell. More deal-making developments might help the bulls push the market further into record territory later in the session. A meeting between the Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones (DJ), and Rupert Murdoch, whose company News Corp. (NWS) made a $5 billion bid for Dow Jones, is scheduled to take place on Monday. Dominion (D) agreed to sell some U.S. gas and oil operations to Loews (LTR) for $4 billion and other operations to XTO Energy (XTO) for $2.5 billion. Avaya (AV) rose more than 3% after The Wall Street Journal reported it is close to a deal to be bought by TPG Capital and Silver Lake Partners for $17 a share, the newspaper added, citing people familiar with the matter. Health Care Properties (HCP) agreed to buy U.S. biotech real estate from Britain's Segro for $2.9 billion. Qiagen (QGEN) agreed to buy Digene (DIGE) for $1.6 billion in cash and stock. AXA (AXA) agreed to sell a Dutch unit for $2.35 billion to SNS Reaal of Holland. Subprime mortgage firm Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. (LEND) said it agreed to be acquired by Lone Star Fund V L.P. for about $400 million, or $15.10 a share, in an all-cash deal. Investors in the pharmaceutical industry were paying close attention the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. Roche (RHHBY), majority owner of Genentech (DNA), fell in Swiss trading on concerns about Avastin's colorectal cancer performance as well as that a lower-dose Avastin version showed improved survival in lung cancer. Bayer (BAY) rose in Germany after it and Onyx (ONXX) reported improved survival from patients taking a liver cancer drug. Early-stage trials from Arqule (ARQL) and Exelexis (EXEL) showed "impressive" response rates, according to analysts at Rodman & Renshaw. Copyright C2003, Dow Jones and Company, Inc.

JPMorgan Chase & Co., the third-largest U.S. bank, and Wells Fargo & Co., the biggest bank on the U.S. West Coast, declined. Abbott Laboratories shares also retreated. General Electric Co., which benefits from faster economic growth, advanced. Solectron Corp., the world&#39;s No. 2 maker of electronics for other companies, surged after rival Flextronics International Ltd. agreed to acquire it for $3.6 billion. ``Markets are starting to factor in forecasts of a faster economic growth in the second part of this year,&#39;&#39; said Vincenzo Riflesso, a trader at Banca IMI in Milan. ``That is driving up expectations on inflation and interest rates. There&#39;s also an understandable incentive to lock in profits after the recent rally.&#39;&#39; U.S. stocks gained on June 1 after government reports showed an improving economic outlook, sending the Standard & Poor&#39;s 500 Index to its third consecutive record. Options on Federal Fund futures indicate an increasing chance the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates as the jobless rate is near the lowest in six years. S&P 500 futures expiring in June fell 4.20 to 1535.50 as of 12:02 p.m. in London. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures lost 31 to 13,658. Nasdaq 100 Index futures slipped 4.25 to 1928. A Commerce Department report due today is likely to show orders placed with American factories rose for a third month in April, gaining 0.7 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. Factory orders increased 3.5 percent in March, the most in a year. The rebound in business activity, an inflation rate which remains at the top of the Fed&#39;s range of acceptability, along with records for stock indexes may lead to a rate rise. Options on Federal Fund futures at the Chicago Board of Trade indicate a 41 percent chance the central bank will lift its target rate for overnight loans between banks to 5.5 percent from the current 5.25 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A month ago, they showed no expectations for an increase. JPMorgan Chase fell 27 cents to $51.63 in Germany. Wells Fargo dropped 17 cents to $36.23, also in Germany. Financial stocks are among the most sensitive to rate rises, which reduce demand for mortgages and loans and make loan defaults more likely. Abbott Laboratories declined 61 cents to $55.69 in Germany. Shares of the drugmaker may fall to $48 each as questions about the safety of its TriCor cholesterol drug rise, Barron&#39;s said, without citing anyone. ``There is absolutely no data to substantiate any change to the safety and efficacy of TriCor,&#39;&#39; Laureen Cassidy, a spokeswoman for Abbott, told Bloomberg News. General Electric shares added 31 cents to $37.45 in Germany. Solectron surged 37 cents to $3.74 in Germany after rival Flextronics agreed to acquire it. Flextronics lost 4 cents to $11.66 in Germany. Dow Jones & Co. shares gained 28 cents to $61.48 in Germany on speculation Rupert Murdoch will try to persuade skeptics among Bancroft family members that he&#39;s sincere in his pledge to maintain editorial independence at company when he meets with them today regarding his takeover proposal. ``He&#39;ll try to show them he is a newspaper man at heart and convince them that he&#39;ll do what&#39;s right,&#39;&#39; said Richard Dorfman, managing director of Richard Alan Inc., an investment firm focusing on media companies based in New York. ``He&#39;s put on the charm offensive.&#39;&#39; Shares of Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. increased after reports showed the companies&#39; drugs provided advances against cancer. Onyx Pharmaceuticals surged $2.38 to $33.26 in Germany and Bristol-Myers Squibb climbed 38 cents to $30.86. Health Care Property Investors Inc. may move. Segro Plc, owner of five of the U.K.&#39;s largest business parks, plans to sell its U.S. arm to Health Care Property Investors for $2.9 billion. Palm Inc. surged 98 cents to $17.07 in Germany. The maker of the Treo mobile phone and e-mail device agreed to sell a 25 percent stake to private-equity firm Elevation Partners for $325 million and announced an overhaul of its board. Palm will pay $940 million in cash, or about $9 a share, to existing shareholders, financing that with the $325 million from Elevation, $400 million of new debt and existing cash on its balance sheet, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said in a statement on Business Wire today. Nike Inc., the world&#39;s largest athletic-shoe maker, gained 69 cents to $57.38 in Germany, after Citigroup Inc. raised its price estimate on the stock by 12 percent to $65. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. climbed 86 cents to $50.33 in Germany after Morgan Stanley raised the stock to ``overweight&#39;&#39; from ``equal-weight.&#39;&#39; JPMorgan lifted its recommendation to ``overweight&#39;&#39; from ``neutral.&#39;&#39; Indexes of commodities, energy, consumer and industrial shares touched all-time highs on June 1 after hiring almost doubled and inflation trailed economists&#39; forecasts.

Under Panama, which was launched in February, sponsored search results are based on items such as relevancy and not just on the advertiser's bid price. Yahoo Search Marketing Commercial API Program , both businesses and individual developers have access to a series of application program interfaces (APIs) so that they can tweak the Panama platform to suit their individual needs. The company is offering three levels of partnership, ranging from a free "basic" deal for small advertising agencies and technology companies, to "advanced" and "elite" levels with varying subscription rates. All participants in the Panama APIs, regardless of partnership level, have access to the software platform and any related technical support. Advanced partners also have account management support and a listing in Yahoo's partner directory.

"We have a favorable long-term view of natural-gas pricing in the United States and believe natural gas will increasingly be the fuel of choice in the future," said Loews Chief Executive James Tisch in a statement. Natural-gas producer XTO Energy Inc. will pay $2.5 billion for Dominion's operations in the Rocky Mountains, Gulf Coast, San Juan Basin and southern Louisiana. XTO said that it is considering setting up a $500 million limited partnership to include its production properties, including the Dominion assets. XTO shares shot up to a record high of $62.25 and ended the day 5.6% higher at $61.61. Loews shares also hit a new all-time before closing 2.6% higher at $52.35. Dominion shares closed up 0.3% to $87.87. The sale, which was expected, continues Dominion's retrenchment from natural-gas production as it concentrates on its core natural-gas transport, storage and power operations. Previously, the Richmond, Va.-based company had agreed to sell nearly all its offshore Gulf of Mexico oil and gas operations for $4.76 billion, as well as its Canadian oil and gas reserves for $583 million. But several analysts said that they had expected Dominion would fetch more for its assets. Banc of America Securities analyst Shelby Tucker called the $6.5 billion in anticipated proceeds "disappointing," saying Monday that he had estimated Dominion would make about $8 billion on the operations. BMO Capital Markets lowered its rating on the company to market perform from outperform on the sale and cut its price target by $9 to $95. "It now appears that total [exploration and production] proceeds could total about $13 billion to $13.5 billion, below our $14 billion to $16 billion projection," BMO analyst Michael Worms wrote in a note to investors. In November, Dominion announced plans to sell all of its exploration and production operations, except its holdings in the Appalachian Basin, as it tried to make its risk profile more similar to those of other utilities. It said that it would use proceeds to pay down debt, buy shares, and acquire other assets to strengthen its remaining businesses. Monday's sale includes 3.51 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural-gas and oil reserves as of Dec. 31. The company has now arranged to sell 85% of the reserves it plans to sell. HSBC Securities analyst Angie Storozynski said that she now expects Dominion will make about $13.7 billion from the entire sale, down from her previous estimate of $15.2 billion. She also cut her price target on the stock. After the divestures, Dominion said that it should be able to post at least $6 a share in 2008 operating earnings. Dominion Chief Executive Thomas Farrell added that the company's earnings per share should be able to increase at least 4% to 6% a year in the following years.

The Gibraltar-based company is ``voluntarily&#39;&#39; responding to a request for information from the U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office for the southern district of New York, PartyGaming said in a statement, adding that it&#39;s too early to say what the outcome will be. Online gambling industry executives were arrested in the U.S. last year after the country&#39;s government cracked down on Internet betting. David Carruthers, then chief executive officer of Betonsports Plc, was detained in July. Peter Dicks was arrested in September, when he was chairman of Sportingbet Plc. ``If PartyGaming can positively resolve this it will be good news for the share price,&#39;&#39; because anxiety about legal issues has been ``holding up potential M&A activity,&#39;&#39; said Julian Easthope, an analyst at UBS AG in London. Potential acquirers and lenders are concerned about possible future legal action or costs related to past activity in the U.S., Easthope said. Shares of PartyGaming were down 0.5 pence at 41 pence in London. They&#39;ve gained 37 percent in the past six months after losing more than half their value on the first trading day after the law was passed by Congress. PartyGaming lost about three- quarters of its revenue when President George W. Bush signed a law aimed at shutting down U.S. online gaming. Analysts have said Ladbrokes Plc&#39;s discussions to buy Web gaming company 888 Holdings Plc were called off because of concern about legal risks after a U.S. crackdown on Web gambling last year. Discussions had also been held between PartyGaming and 888, people familiar with the situation have said. The discussions with U.S. legal authorities follow ``some uncertainty as to what actions, if any, U.S. law enforcement agencies may take against&#39;&#39; Internet gaming companies following last year&#39;s arrests, PartyGaming said. The company exited its U.S. business after the law was passed. Since then, some U.S. lawmakers have proposed loosening online gaming legislation. In April, representative Barney Frank, the Democratic chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, introduced legislation that would relax the ban by allowing online gambling in the U.S. with licensed operators.
