http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6646581.stm Cancer therapy cuts side effects 11 May 2007, 11:48 GMT 12:48 therapy cuts side effects Chemotherapy can cause nasty side effects Scientists say they have developed a way to deliver lethal drug doses to tumours without causing side-effects, such as nausea and hair loss. The Australian team has used nanotechnology to create tiny particles which specifically attack cancer cells, but leave healthy tissue unaffected. The particles - or mini-cells - are tagged with anti-cancer antibodies so they zero in on their target. The research features in the journal Cancer Cell. There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel It is hoped the technique could treat tumours in the breast, ovaries, colon and lungs. So far it has been used in mice and dogs, and the researchers plan to begin human trials shortly. Traditional chemotherapy typically involves subjecting the patient's entire body to powerful drugs, which can cause a range of severe side-effects. The mini-cells - about one-fifth the size of a normal cell - were created from bacteria cells stripped of their reproductive powers. They were then loaded with cancer drugs, and tagged with antibodies which are attracted to cancerous tumours. Once the cell reaches the cancer, the drug is released directly into the malignant growth. Researcher Jennifer MacDiarmid, from Sydney-based biotechnology company EnGeneIC, said: "There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel." In tests, the technique reduced tumours in animals without side effects - and by using only a very small amount of drug. Dr MacDiarmid said the treatment could potentially be used on any solid tumours. She said the technique potentially paved the way for customised drug cocktails for individual patients. Professor Quentin Pankhurst, of the London Centre for Nanotechnology, said: "The concept of targeted drug delivery is something which has been around for a while and there are many different avenues that have been tested. "This one looks like an interesting and promising one. "I particularly like the fact that these mini-cells, as they call them, seem to be swallowed up by the cancer cells and taken inside the cancer cells, because that is inherently a very powerful way to actually deliver the drug - actually into the cell." control chemotherapy impact 11 Apr 07 | Health Hope over 'new generation' drugs 18 May 06 | Health London Centre for Nanotechnology back folic acid in flour Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Drinking at home 'cuts bingeing'
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/england/essex/6644841.stm | Essex | Gynaecologist lacked op consent 10 May 2007, 20:02 GMT 21:02 lacked op consent The General Medical Council said the case was "wholly exceptional" A gynaecologist who failed to obtain consent from a woman for an operation which left her unable to have sex has not been struck off. The General Medical Council (GMC) ruled it had been an "exceptional" case that saw Essex-based Dr June Swinhoe fail in her practise. Marian Howland, 52, from Epping, had not been made aware of risks linked to her operation for a prolapse in 2003. The GMC panel ruled Dr Swinhoe posed no risk to patients. In March 2003, Dr Swinhoe was working as a consultant gynaecologist at King George Hospital in Ilford and privately at Holly House Hospital in Buckhurst Hill. I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily Mrs Howland had been married for eight years when she visited Dr Swinhoe with a prolapse and discomfort during sex. She told the panel she was admitted for the prolapse to be repaired but was not informed of all the side effects or of any risks associated with the procedures. Dr Swinhoe had not taken a full medical history from Mrs Howland who had previously had a hysterectomy, her ovaries removed and become blind in one eye. In tears, Mrs Howland told the panel a few weeks after the operation it became clear she had been left unable to have sex, and had been left "shell-shocked". She added: "I have lost my best friend, my husband, my lover. "I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily." The panel told Dr Swinhoe: "The deficiencies in your communication with Mrs Howland and your failure to obtain consent from her were an aberration and amount to an isolated departure from your usual high standards of professional competence and care. "The finding that your fitness is impaired is, in itself, a very significant mark on your record. "You have learned from this distressing experience. "This is a wholly exceptional case and in the circumstances the panel is satisfied that it is fair, proportionate and sufficient to conclude the case without taking any action in respect of your registration." travel, leisure and more from the BBC website for Essex New lead over Oliver pub robbery Four arrested in drugs house raid Crews tackle fire at listed hotel
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6639461.stm Oral sex linked to throat cancer 10 May 2007, 07:40 GMT 08:40 sex linked to throat cancer Scientists looked at tissue samples from patients A virus contracted through oral sex is the cause of some throat cancers, say US scientists. HPV infection was found to be a much stronger risk factor than tobacco or alcohol use, the Johns Hopkins University study of 300 people found. The New England Journal of Medicine study said the risk was almost nine times higher for people who reported oral sex with more than six partners. But experts said a larger study was needed to confirm the findings. HPV infection is the cause of the majority of cervical cancers, and 80% of sexually active women can expect to have an HPV infection at some point in their lives. It is important for health care providers to know that people without the traditional risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use can nevertheless be at risk of oropharyngeal cancer Dr Gypsyamber D'Souza, study author The Johns Hopkins study took blood and saliva from 100 men and women newly diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer which affects the throat, tonsils and back of the tongue. They also asked questions about sex practices and other risk factors for the disease, such as family history. Those who had evidence of prior oral HPV infection had a 32-fold increased risk of throat cancer. HPV16 - one of the most common cancer-causing strains of the virus - was present in the tumours of 72% of cancer patients in the study. There was no added risk for people infected with HPV who also smoked and drank alcohol, suggesting the virus itself is driving the risk of the cancer. Oral sex was said to be the main mode of transmission of HPV but the researchers said mouth-to-mouth transmission, for example through kissing, could not be ruled out. Most HPV infections clear with little or no symptoms but a small percentage of people who acquired high-risk strains may develop a cancer, the researchers added. Study author Dr Gypsyamber D'Souza said: "It is important for health care providers to know that people without the traditional risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use can nevertheless be at risk of oropharyngeal cancer." Co-researcher Dr Maura Gillison said previous research by the team had suggested there was a strong link. But she added: "People should be reassured that oropharyngeal cancer is relatively uncommon and the overwhelming majority of people with an oral HPV infection probably will not get throat cancer." A vaccine which protects against cervical cancer caused by HPV strains 6, 11, 16 and 18, and also against genital warts is available and the researchers said the study provided a rationale for vaccinating both girls and boys. But whether the vaccine would protect against oral HPV infection is not yet known. Dr Julie Sharp, science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: "There is conflicting evidence about the role of HPV, and this rare type of mouth cancer. "As this was a small study, further research is needed to confirm these observations." "We know that after age, the main causes of mouth cancer are smoking or chewing tobacco or betel nut, and drinking too much alcohol." jab plea for girls aged 11 06 Oct 06 | Health Virus causes most cervical cancer 23 Sep 03 | Health Oral cancer fear for Asians 03 Mar 03 | Health Cervical cancer vaccine success 20 Nov 02 | Health New England Journal of Medicine Johns Hopkins Cancer Center Condom Essential Wear campaign back folic acid in flour Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Drinking at home 'cuts bingeing'
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/education/6641811.stm | Toddlers to get help with talking 10 May 2007, 10:28 GMT 11:28 to get help with talking One in 10 children have a communication disability Toddlers are to get help learning how to talk in a bid to cut the numbers of children starting school with poor language skills for their age. Half of children enter primary school unable to speak as well as they are expected to, research suggests. The Early Talk programme which uses gestures, symbols and signing to expand vocabulary, is being piloted in 200 government-backed children's centres. It will also be used to target youngsters with potential difficulties. Television doesn't respond well to children. ICAN head of Early Years Clare Geldard, head of Early Years for the charity behind the programme, I CAN, said there were concerns that the number of pre-school children with speech and language difficulties was on the rise. "We don't know why this is the case and I am sure there are a myriad of reasons. "We know that television can be used in a really productive way in terms of watching a piece of television and then having a conversation about it afterwards, but we also know that television doesn't respond well to children. "It does not give them the interactivity that children and adults instinctively seek from adults." She said the Early Talk programme was about ensuring that nursery staff, childminders and parents had the basic skills they needed to enhance children's speech, language and communication. "Everybody needs to have a basic knowledge about what we can do to enhance children's speech and language development," she said. But it was also about ensuring that those children who had the potential to go on to develop speech and language difficulties were picked up early and given the help they need. I CAN's chief executive Virginia Beardshaw said one in 10 children across the UK were thought to have a communication disability. She added that the Early Talk programme, which will ultimately be rolled out to 3,000 Sure Start children's centres, would foster environments "where communication is embedded". This would range from using pictures, symbols and gestures to teach vocabulary to using group work and specialist help from speech and language therapists, she said. Children's minister Beverley Hughes said: "Communication is a vital skill in life and we want to help all children communicate better and reap the rewards of that later in life. "This is especially important for children who have trouble communicating - particularly those with a communication disability - who are much more likely to develop behavioural and learning problems." She said she hoped the partnership being announced would play a vital role in identifying children's difficulties at an early stage. Nursery and children's centre staff will be given training and packages of support to help ensure children's language skills are polished and it is hoped this will be passed on to parents and children's carers. skills 'cut re-offending' 05 May 07 | Health 'Double blow' for autistic pupils 16 Apr 07 | Education Autism 'more common than thought' 13 Jul 06 | Health 'Two languages' call for children 21 Feb 07 | Edinburgh and East papers tagged to beat cheats Summer school programme grows City teachers could get more cash

However, patients may find problems getting Avastin, as the NHS drugs watchdogs have yet to consider whether to sanction its use. The drug is designed to be used in tandem with another chemotherapy agent, paclitaxel. Avastin, which works by starving cancer cells of a blood supply, has previously been used to treat bowel cancer. All breast cancer treatments will have risks and benefits so it is vital women have all the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment options However, the drug was rejected for NHS use in England and Wales for that purpose last year. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) ruled that it was not cost-effective. In trials, breast cancer patients who took Avastin and paclitaxel went an average of 13 months without their cancer growing, compared with an average of 6.7 months for patients who took paclitaxel alone. Professor David Miles, a consultant medical oncologist at the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, Middlesex, said: "This provides some hope for the 13,000 patients a year that are told the devastating news they have metastatic breast cancer which cannot be cured with surgery. "It is an important step forward to have discovered another targeted treatment which can inhibit the growth of breast cancer and as a result increase significantly the time that patients' breast cancer is controlled." Dr Emma Pennery, a nurse consultant at the charity Breast Cancer Care, said women with secondary breast cancer would welcome any treatment that could potentially slow down the progression of their disease. "This announcement means that there is now another treatment option available, adding to the growing range of targeted drugs for breast cancer." Dr Pennery called on the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Medicines Consortium to appraise the drug as soon as possible. Dr Sarah Rawlings, of the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: "The development of targeted therapies like this is an important step forward in cancer treatment. "Avastin is an additional treatment option that will be welcomed by women with metastatic breast cancer, although it's important to remember it might not be suitable for everyone. "All breast cancer treatments will have risks and benefits so it is vital women have all the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment options.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/health/2000/heart_disease/default.stm BBC News | Health | Heart Disease The UK has one of the highest rates of death from heart disease in the world - one British adult dies from the disease every three minutes - and stroke is the country's third biggest killer, claiming 70,000 lives each year. Heart attacks occur when blood flow is blocked, often by a blood clot, while strokes are caused either by blocked or burst blood vessels in the brain. A range of other conditions, including heart failure, when blood is not pumped properly around the body, and congenital heart defects can also cause long term problems, and even death, for sufferers. - The blood returns from the lungs to the upper left chamber of the heart where it is again briefly stored until the atrium fills, before flowing on to the left ventricle. - “Impure” or “blue” blood returning from the atrium enters the heart here, where it is held until the atrium - or chamber - fills up. - This is the most powerful chamber of the heart. It pumps the newly oxygenated blood to the rest of the body through the aorta, or main artery. - This powerful pump propels blood into the pulmonary artery, the tube which carries blood to the lungs, where carbon dioxide in the blood is removed and oxygen added.

The study also said that parents who do not want their children to drink behind their backs should limit their pocket money to less than £10 a week. The study, led by Liverpool John Moores University, was based on responses from more than 10,000 15 and 16-year-olds. Almost 90% admitted to drinking alcohol, of which 38% binged, 24% drank frequently and 50% drank in public. Drinking in the home environment, if it is done properly, can teach young people respect for alcohol Liverpool John Moores University The study also found a third of respondents bought their own alcohol, and those that did were six times more likely to drink in public, and twice as likely to binge than those who had alcohol bought for them. Last month the charity Alcohol Concern called for parents who give alcohol to children aged under 15 to be prosecuted following figures suggesting a large increase in alcohol consumption by 11 to 13-year-olds. But the latest study, published in the journal Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy, questions this approach. Lead researcher Dr Mark Bellis said figures suggested that 75% of 14-year-olds had tried alcohol. "The question is: are they learning to drink from their parents in a socially responsible environment, or are they learning behind some bushes in the park, or in a bar where they should not be in the first place? "The chances are if they are in the latter position they are learning to binge drink, they are hiding their drinking, they can't talk to their parents about it. "Drinking in the home environment, if it is done properly, can teach young people respect for alcohol, and how to consume in moderation." Dr Bellis said criminalising a parent for allowing a child to drink was probably not going to help any family. Frank Soodeen, campaigns officer for Alcohol Concern, said the charity had taken its lead from the law, which prohibits under-15s from being served alcohol in public places. He agreed that it was appropriate for parents to allow drinking in the home for older teenagers - but reiterated the charity's view that younger teenagers should not be encouraged to drink. He said: "We agree that parents have a real role to play in raising socially responsible drinkers." The researchers say that increasing the cost of alcohol, and closing down retailers who sell to underage drinkers could help tackle the problem. to stop children's drinking 27 Apr 07 | UK Drink campaign 'has wrong focus' 17 Mar 07 | UK Shows 'encourage teen drinking' 10 Mar 07 | Health Call to raise drinking age to 21 15 Apr 07 | Health Liverpool John Moores University Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy back folic acid in flour Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Drinking at home 'cuts bingeing'
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6643547.stm Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' 10 May 2007, 23:01 GMT 00:01 'prevents bowel cancer' Aspirin could benefit high-risk groups, the study says Taking aspirin each day can prevent bowel cancer developing, a study says. Oxford University researchers said taking a dose of 300mg a day for five years offered the protection. Long-term aspirin use is generally not backed because of the risk of stomach problems, but the team said it could benefit those at high-risk of cancer. Cancer campaigners welcomed the study - published in the Lancet - which examined data from previous research covering more than 7,500 people. These findings are not an indication that the general population should rush out and take what is a high dosage of aspirin on a daily basis. Each year, around 35,000 men and women in the UK are diagnosed with bowel cancer, and more than 16,000 die from the disease. The researchers looked at the results from two large-scale UK trials carried out in the late 1970s and early 1980s covering over 7,500 people which had given some people 300, 500 or 1,200mg per day doses of aspirin or a dummy pill for five to seven years. The people in the study were then followed for up to 20 years, and deaths from bowel cancer were logged. The team say it takes at least 10 years to see an effect, because that is how long it takes for a pre-cancerous growths to develop into cancer. Other studies have examined aspirin's benefits. However, this was the first where people were allocated to take different doses of the drug, or the fake version, rather than looking back at the aspirin use of bowel cancer patients and comparing them with healthy people. High risk group 'benefit' The researchers found that taking 300mg of aspirin - the equivalent of one pill - a day for five years reduced the incidence of bowel cancer by 74% in the subsequent 10 to 15 years. An accompanying review of 30 observational studies suggested taking medium-to-high doses of aspirin for 10 years or more reduced the risk of developing the disease by 50%-70%. The protective effect of aspirin appeared to be consistent regardless of age, sex, race or country of origin. It was also seen in individuals who had a close family relative with bowel cancer, which normally raises the lifetime risk two to four times. Professor Peter Rothwell, who led the research, said: "What we are saying is that for a subgroup of people at high risk of bowel cancer, they probably aren't going to be dramatically harmed by taking aspirin. "They may have some risk of bleeding in the stomach, but they will see potentially significant benefits in the reduction of their colon cancer risk. "In that situation, I think taking aspirin daily would be worthwhile." Dr Andrew Chan, from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, writing in the Lancet, said the findings were "convincing evidence" that aspirin can reduce the incidence of bowel cancer. But he added: "With the concerns about the potential risks of long-term aspirin use and the availability of alternative prevention strategies - such as screening - these findings are not sufficient to warrant a recommendation for the general population to use aspirin for cancer prevention." Rob Glynne-Jones, chief medical advisor to the charity Bowel Cancer UK, said: "This is very interesting and it certainly confirms what we already know and believe about the links between aspirin, polyps and the development of bowel cancer.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/6645923.stm | North Yorkshire | Scientists create 'plastic' blood 11 May 2007, 09:08 GMT 10:08 create 'plastic' blood The researchers said the artificial blood was easier to store Scientists have developed an artificial plastic blood which could act as a substitute in emergencies. Researchers at Sheffield University said their creation could be a huge advantage in war zones. They say that the artificial blood is light to carry, does not need to be kept cool and can be kept for longer. The new blood is made up of plastic molecules that have an iron atom at their core, like haemoglobin, that can carry oxygen through the body. The scientists said the artificial blood could be cheap to produce and they were looking for extra funding to develop a final prototype that would be suitable for biological testing. Dr Lance Twyman, of the university's Department of Chemistry, said: "We are very excited about the potential for this product and about the fact that this could save lives. "Many people die from superficial wounds when they are trapped in an accident or are injured on the battlefield and can't get blood before they get to hospital. "This product can be stored a lot more easily than blood, meaning large quantities could be carried easily by ambulances and the armed forces." A sample of the artificial blood prototype will be on display at the Science Museum in London from 22 May as part of an exhibition about the history of plastics. travel, leisure and more from the BBC website for South Yorkshire NORTH YORKSHIRE STORIES Policeman jailed over child sex Battlefield homes get green light Allotment produce declared safe
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6641115.stm | Warning as tick diseases on rise 10 May 2007, 08:45 GMT 09:45 as tick diseases on rise Diseases spread by ticks have risen over the past few years The public has been warned to take extra precautions against ticks as the warm weather heralds a peak in numbers of the blood-sucking parasites. It follows a huge rise in cases of Lyme Disease in Scotland and encephalitis amongst travellers to mainland Europe, spread by ticks. Both infections are severely debilitating and can be fatal. A decade ago there were just 10 cases of Lyme Disease in Scotland, but last year that figure had risen to 177. In mainland Europe, tick-borne encephalitis is also on the rise and is now endemic in 27 countries. Make sure you know about bite prevention, how to look out for the early symptoms and remember to seek advice The advice to anyone heading into the countryside is to wear insect repellent and long trousers if possible and to check themselves thoroughly afterwards. Ticks should be removed by gripping them close to the skin with tweezers and pulling backwards without jerking or twisting. They are common in woodland, heath land and in particular areas in Scotland where deer graze. More recently they have also been found in urban parks. A spokesman for the Tick Alert campaign said: "Ticks are second only to mosquitoes for carrying disease to humans. "Travellers and holidaymakers visiting rural areas are at risk from tick bites, but also when spending time in public spaces including beer gardens, picnic spots and parks and gardens. "Make sure you know about bite prevention, how to look out for the early symptoms and remember to seek advice well before your travel date." Wear trousers tucked into socks Check warm folds of the skin Carefully remove with tweezers Do not try to drown in Vaseline Be aware of favoured habitats Lyme disease varies widely but can include a rash and flu-like symptoms in its initial stage, followed by the possibility of musculoskeletal, arthritic, neurological, psychiatric and cardiac problems. Most cases of Lyme disease can be cured with antibiotics, especially if treatment is begun early in the course of illness. Katrina Anderson, from Edinburgh, became ill after she was bitten by a tick in 1991. She was misdiagnosed by her GP who blamed ME for her chronic fatigue and it took another two years before she was told by a specialist that she had contracted Lyme disease. Ms Anderson said: "At the time I was actually very ill. I became very flu-like with muscle pains, constant headaches. "It was like having a virus. It's like a hidden illness. You don't actually see what the person is suffering from. "It can affect all aspects of your nervous system."

The study also said that parents who do not want their children to drink behind their backs should limit their pocket money to less than £10 a week. The study, led by Liverpool John Moores University, was based on responses from more than 10,000 15 and 16-year-olds. Almost 90% admitted to drinking alcohol, of which 38% binged, 24% drank frequently and 50% drank in public. Drinking in the home environment, if it is done properly, can teach young people respect for alcohol Liverpool John Moores University The study also found a third of respondents bought their own alcohol, and those that did were six times more likely to drink in public, and twice as likely to binge than those who had alcohol bought for them. Last month the charity Alcohol Concern called for parents who give alcohol to children aged under 15 to be prosecuted following figures suggesting a large increase in alcohol consumption by 11 to 13-year-olds. But the latest study, published in the journal Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy, questions this approach. Lead researcher Dr Mark Bellis said figures suggested that 75% of 14-year-olds had tried alcohol. "The question is: are they learning to drink from their parents in a socially responsible environment, or are they learning behind some bushes in the park, or in a bar where they should not be in the first place? "The chances are if they are in the latter position they are learning to binge drink, they are hiding their drinking, they can't talk to their parents about it. "Drinking in the home environment, if it is done properly, can teach young people respect for alcohol, and how to consume in moderation." Dr Bellis said criminalising a parent for allowing a child to drink was probably not going to help any family. Frank Soodeen, campaigns officer for Alcohol Concern, said the charity had taken its lead from the law, which prohibits under-15s from being served alcohol in public places. He agreed that it was appropriate for parents to allow drinking in the home for older teenagers - but reiterated the charity's view that younger teenagers should not be encouraged to drink. He said: "We agree that parents have a real role to play in raising socially responsible drinkers." The researchers say that increasing the cost of alcohol, and closing down retailers who sell to underage drinkers could help tackle the problem. to stop children's drinking 27 Apr 07 | UK Drink campaign 'has wrong focus' 17 Mar 07 | UK Shows 'encourage teen drinking' 10 Mar 07 | Health Call to raise drinking age to 21 15 Apr 07 | Health Liverpool John Moores University Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy back folic acid in flour Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Drinking at home 'cuts bingeing'
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6642749.stm Drugs adviser raises charity fear 10 May 2007, 23:01 GMT 00:01 adviser raises charity fear The drugs are reserved for those with moderate Alzheimer's Concerns have been raised about the links between pharmaceutical firms and charity patient groups by the body that advises the NHS on which drugs to use. Sir Michael Rawlins, chairman of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, said charities had to be wary of pharmaceutical donations. And he urged charities to question the cost of drugs more. But patient groups said there were strict guidelines covering such donations by the drugs industry. I have yet ever to hear a patient organisation criticise a price of the drug Sir Michael Rawlins, of NICE Sir Michael said: "Patient organisations need to think very carefully about why pharmaceutical companies are giving them money and they have to make sure they are not beholden to a pharmaceutical company. "I have yet ever to hear a patient organisation criticise a price of the drug. "When they do that they will come into their own." Sir Michael refused to name individual groups The subject of drug firm donations to patients groups and charities is a sensitive issue. Several groups, although not all, accept donations from drug firms. Most of those that do have codes of conduct setting out what those donations can and cannot be used for - most are restricted to funding education purposes than for campaigning. The Alzheimer's Society is involved in legal action along with Eisai and Pfizer against NICE over the decision to restrict the use of Alzheimer's treatments. The group has accepted money from both companies. But a spokeswoman pointed out that drug firm donations account for less than 1% of its income. She said the society's challenge was being done independently of the drug firms and added donations were never used to fund campaign activity. Breast Cancer Care, which pushed for NICE to approve the so-called breast cancer wonder-drug Herceptin, has received money from its maker Roche. A spokeswoman said any drug industry donations were always used for "impartial patient information". She added it was important there was a dialogue between patient groups and drug companies and she agreed cost was something that needed to be debated. "The cost of drug is clearly becoming a major factor in the potential for cancer treatment and must be addressed." And the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry denied there was anything wrong with such donations. "Patient groups and companies have a shared interest. When they work together it is in the patients' interests, usually to do with education programmes or disease awareness.

University officials are considering whether they should ban physiotherapy lecturers from using large exercise balls as chairs. Physiotherapists at the University of Bath say sitting on the balls while working at a desk encourages good posture and tones core muscles. Their professional body agrees that they are beneficial and carry no risk. But health and safety officials are concerned that the giant inflatables may be dangerous. A spokesman for the university said: "The university's health and safety team are looking into whether the balls meet the university's guidelines on conventional chairs to see if the trial can be allowed to become a permanent situation. We expect the result of this shortly." The balls are often used in gyms and are also known as Swiss balls because they were first used in Switzerland in the 1960s by therapists working with children with cerebral palsy. Physiotherapist Sonya Crowe from the university's Department for Health started a trend when she began using an exercise ball instead of a chair. Ms Crowe, who is the sports physiotherapist for the British beach volleyball team, said: "The balls are firm with a bit of give, so it is not difficult to balance on top of them, but the constant small movements you make whilst sitting at a desk are perfect for strengthening your core muscles. "You also have to sit upright, so they are perfect for improving posture. "In particular, people who suffer from back ache and shoulder pain can really benefit from sitting on an exercise ball instead of a regular office chair." She added: "I have never heard of anyone falling off one of the balls - and the health and safety benefits far outweigh any risks there may be." Ms Crowe's colleague Emily Richards said: "You couldn't miss the fact that Sonya was sat on a big squashy ball instead of an office chair. "A few of us tried it out and could see the benefit immediately. We put in a bulk order and now at least a dozen people around the university have got them." She added: "It seems to have started a real craze, and my husband has now got one at his work to help his bad back." The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy said there was no risk if the balls were used properly. One sports website warns that jewellery and belt buckles could burst the ball but says that most are made to deflate slowly rather than explode.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6648059.stm Experts back folic acid in flour 11 May 2007, 17:03 GMT 18:03 back folic acid in flour Under the plan, all bread would be made with folic acid-fortified flour The UK's official food watchdog is backing the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid to reduce birth defects such as spina bifida. The proposal will go before the board of the Food Standards Agency next week for ratification. If passed, ministers will then decide whether to press ahead. Scientific research shows that folic acid significantly cuts the risk of neural tube defects, which affect up to 900 pregnancies a year in the UK. However, there is concern that adding the vitamin to flour could harm some elderly patients, as it could mask a deficiency in the B12 vitamin. Up to 10% of those aged 65 and older have borderline B12 levels and could tip into deficiency. In extreme cases, this can cause irreversible damage to the nervous system. The recommendation to the FSA board suggests that products containing folic acid at nutritionally significant levels should be clearly labelled. It also argues that mandatory fortification should be accompanied by new controls on the voluntary addition of folic acid to other products, such as breakfast cereals and low-fat spreads, and on the use of folic acid supplements. A system for monitoring the health impact of fortification would also be needed. Wholemeal flour would be exempt from fortification in order to give consumers more choice. The FSA already advises women to eat extra folic acid when trying to get pregnant. However, research suggests that only half of such women adhere to this advice. Also, up to half of pregnancies are unplanned, meaning women may miss the opportunity. Each year between 500 and 600 babies in the UK are reported to have neural tube defects. It is thought many of the other affected pregnancies are terminated. Mandatory fortification has already been introduced in the USA, Canada and Chile, where it cut NTD rates by between 27% and 50%. A panel of UK experts, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), last year backed mandatory fortification of flour. SACN found no evidence that vitamin B12 deficiency was masked in older people, provided folic acid doses were 1mg a day or less. An FSA consultation on the issue drew 202 responses from industry, consumer groups and individuals. The baking industry raised "practical concerns" about the fortification of bread. It said bread-making flour couldn't easily be separated from other flours in mills. acid 'should be in flour' 12 Dec 06 | Health Folic acid boosts IVF twin births 05 May 06 | Health Folic acid 'cuts dementia risk' 15 Aug 05 | Health Push to add folic acid to bread 05 Apr 06 | Health Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Scientific Advisory Committee of Nutrition back folic acid in flour Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Drinking at home 'cuts bingeing'

The disease tends to affect older people - but can strike at any time. Excluding certain skin cancers, there were more than 270,000 new cases of the disease in 2001 - and the rate is increasing by about 1% a year. Some cancer, such as breast, are becoming more common, while new cases of lung cancer fall away due to the drop in the number of smokers. However, while the overall number of new cancers is not falling, the good news is that successful treatment rates for many of the most common types are improving rapidly.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4121411.stm Pregnancy timeline 23 December, 2004, 13:42 GMT occurs and a ball of quickly multiplying cells embeds itself in the lining of the uterus. In the UK pregnancy is calculated from the first day of the woman's last period so for as much as three weeks of this first month she might not be actually pregnant. When fertilisation does occur the tiny mass of cells called a blastocyst at this stage embeds itself in the lining of the womb which is already thickening to support it. The mass of cells is developing fast and becomes an embryo. For many women the first sign of pregnancy is a missed period. Shopbought tests are considered largely reliable so the mother-to-be does not have to have her pregnancy confirmed by her GP. If a first test is negative a second one a few days later may prove positive as hormone levels in the urine rise. The embryo officially becomes a foetus. It is about the size of a baked bean and its spine and nervous system begin to form. The foetus already has its own blood system and may be a different blood group from its mother. Blood vessels are forming in what will become the umbilical cord and tiny buds which will become limbs appear. The baby&acute;s heart is beginning to develop. Morning sickness and other side effects of early pregnancy may take hold. Around this time many women find they experience the side-effects of early pregnancy including needing to urinate more often nausea and vomiting and feeling a bit weepy and irritable. All medication including supplements need to be carefully checked as the foetus is undergoing vital development in the first 12 weeks. If the woman has not told her GP or community midwife she is pregnant yet now is a good time to do so. It is quite common to have a first scan at this stage if the woman has had a previous miscarriage or bleeding. An early scan is often done through the vagina and is used to check the pregnancy is not ectopic. It should show up the baby&acute;s heartbeat. The nervous system is also developing rapidly especially the brain. The head gets bigger and eyes form under the skin of the face. The foetus' limbs are growing and look more like arms and legs. All internal organs are developing and becoming more complex. The foetus is about 5cm long with its head tucked onto its chest. It has most its major organs and eyes and ears are developing. A scan at 10-13 weeks is recommended to pin down the date of the pregnancy. The umbilical cord is fully formed providing nourishment and removing waste products. The foetus looks fully human now. By this week the threat of miscarriage is much reduced. Many women announce their pregnancy to friends and colleagues. The foetus is growing in length much more quickly by now it is about eight cm long and weighs about 60 grams. The placenta is now wellformed though it's not yet doing its full job it takes over fully in week 14. The mother is likely to have her first scan this week. The womans uterus is becoming larger and is starting to rise out of the pelvis. The foetus can move its head quite easily. Third of the way through. The average pregnancy lasts 266 days or 280 days from the first day of last period. Screening for Downs syndrome is offered about now. A simple blood test is carried out first then further tests may be offered. On the basis of the blood test results the woman may opt for a Chorionic Villus sample or an amniocentesis which would diagnose or other chromosomal abnormalities. However these diagnostic tests have a small risk of subsequent miscarriage. An alternative to blood tests is a nuchal translucency scan a new scan offered by some larger hospitals. But again an amniocentisis would be required for firm diagnosis. The foetus now has toe and finger nails eyebrows and eyelashes. It is also covered with downy hair. The hair that will cover the baby until the last week or so of pregnancy - called lanugo - starts to form. This hair is very fine more like down and it probably serves as some form of insulation and protection for the skin. The foetus can hear noises from the outside world. By this stage the mother is visibly pregnant and the uterus is rising. By this stage the foetus is moving around a lot - probably enough to be felt. The foetus is now about 15-20cm long and weighs about 300g. Milk teeth have formed in the gums. Half way through pregnancy now. Almost all mothers are offered a routine scan. The foetus develops a waxy coating called vernix. The scan can show the foetus in fine detail and often reveal if the baby is a boy or a girl. However not all hospitals offer to tell parents the sex of the child - and not all parents want to know. The mother may feel short of breath as her uterus pushes against her diaphragm leaving less space for the lungs. The mother may be offered another ultrasound scan around this time. The scan can check the baby&acute;s spine internal organs and growth are normal. Senses develop: taste buds have started to form on the tongue and the foetus starts to feel touch. The skeleton continues to develop and bones that form the skull begin to harden - but not fully. Antenatal checkup and scan to check the baby&acute;s position. A baby born this early does sometimes survive. A baby born at 24 weeks may possibly survive but it would have severe breathing difficulties as its lungs would not be strong enough to cope. It would also be very thin lightweight and susceptible to infections. All organs are now in place and the rest of the pregnancy is for growth. Preeclampsia is a risk from here onwards. This potentially fatal condition causes high blood pressure protein in the urine and swelling caused by fluid retention. The causes are unclear but research suggests it may be linked to an immune reaction to the foetus or the placenta. If the condition is serious women may be advised to take drugs to lower their blood pressure and in some cases an early caesarean or induction may be performed. Serious complications of pregnancy The foetus skin is gradually becoming more opaque than transparent. The foetus measures about 34cm and weighs about 800g. Routine checkup to test for preeclampsia. Women with Rhesus negative blood will also be tested for antibodies. If the mother has Rh negative blood but the baby is Rh positive she can develop antibodies to her baby&acute;s blood during labour. This is not a problem in the first birth but can affect subsequent pregnancies and result in stillbirth. Fortunately treatment is simple and effective. BBC Health: Ask the doctor - Rhesus disease Some women develop restless leg syndrome in their third trimester. This is sensations such as crawling tingling or even cramps and burning inside the foot or leg - often in the evening and at night disturbing sleep and making the mother feel she needs to get up and walk around. No-one knows what causes this harmless but irritating condition. Braxton Hicks contractions may begin around now. They are practice contractions which dont usually hurt. These are irregular, painless contractions which feel like a squeezing sensation near the top of the uterus. If contractions become painful or occur four times an hour or more, the woman should call a doctor as she may be in early labour. The foetus can see now and tell light from dark. The mother&acute;s breasts start to produce colostrum about now This high calorie milk is produced by the mother to feed the baby for the first few days after birth before normal milk starts. Another antenatal appointment. The foetus is about 42cm and weighs 2.2kg. A baby born now has a good chance of survival. From now the baby should become settled in a head downwards position. A midwife can help to move it if necessary. The mother may find it more difficult to eat full meals as the expanded uterus presses on her stomach. If the mother has been told she may need a planned caesarean, now is a good time to discuss it further. The baby&acute;s head may engage in the pelvis any time now. The baby&acute;s lungs are practically mature now and it can survive unaided. The final weeks in the womb are to put on weight. Babies born from this week onward are not considered early. Another ante-natal appointment. The mother has reached her full size and weight by now. In theory the baby should be born this week. The mother&acute;s cervix prepares for the birth by softening. First babies are often up to a week late but if there are signs of distress to mother or child the birth will be induced. week by week guide to what happens to mother and baby during pregnancy Nine months: An overview Experts back folic acid in flour Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Drinking at home 'cuts bingeing' Week at a Glance
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/6646467.stm | West Midlands | Body parts sale man avoids jail 11 May 2007, 12:51 GMT 13:51 parts sale man avoids jail Daniel Tuck tried to sell his kidney for £24,000 A debt-ridden salesman who tried to sell one of his own kidneys over the internet has been given a 12-month suspended jail sentence. Daniel Tuck, from Oldbury, West Midlands, is the first person to be successfully prosecuted under a new law preventing the sale of body parts. The 26-year-old tried to sell his kidney for £24,000 on a chatroom used by kidney disease sufferers. The judge suspended his sentence for two years and ordered him to pay £250. He had faced up to three years in jail for contravening the Human Tissue Act. I want to sell my kidney - this is 100% genuine. I am a white male of completely perfect health. Tuck had previous convictions for theft and obtaining property by deception. Judge Challinor said: "There is much public disquiet surrounding the sale of body parts for money and there is an understandable revulsion at such practices. "A sentence incorporating an element of deterrence is required." Helena Miller, prosecuting, said Tuck admitted a charge of offering to supply human material for transplantation last month. He had posted an advert on the internet which read: "I am a healthy 25-year-old male from Birmingham in England. I am blood group O+ and am desperate for funds to rebuild my life.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6642749.stm Drugs adviser raises charity fear 10 May 2007, 23:01 GMT 00:01 adviser raises charity fear The drugs are reserved for those with moderate Alzheimer's Concerns have been raised about the links between pharmaceutical firms and charity patient groups by the body that advises the NHS on which drugs to use. Sir Michael Rawlins, chairman of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, said charities had to be wary of pharmaceutical donations. And he urged charities to question the cost of drugs more. But patient groups said there were strict guidelines covering such donations by the drugs industry. I have yet ever to hear a patient organisation criticise a price of the drug Sir Michael Rawlins, of NICE Sir Michael said: "Patient organisations need to think very carefully about why pharmaceutical companies are giving them money and they have to make sure they are not beholden to a pharmaceutical company. "I have yet ever to hear a patient organisation criticise a price of the drug. "When they do that they will come into their own." Sir Michael refused to name individual groups The subject of drug firm donations to patients groups and charities is a sensitive issue. Several groups, although not all, accept donations from drug firms. Most of those that do have codes of conduct setting out what those donations can and cannot be used for - most are restricted to funding education purposes than for campaigning. The Alzheimer's Society is involved in legal action along with Eisai and Pfizer against NICE over the decision to restrict the use of Alzheimer's treatments. The group has accepted money from both companies. But a spokeswoman pointed out that drug firm donations account for less than 1% of its income. She said the society's challenge was being done independently of the drug firms and added donations were never used to fund campaign activity. Breast Cancer Care, which pushed for NICE to approve the so-called breast cancer wonder-drug Herceptin, has received money from its maker Roche. A spokeswoman said any drug industry donations were always used for "impartial patient information". She added it was important there was a dialogue between patient groups and drug companies and she agreed cost was something that needed to be debated. "The cost of drug is clearly becoming a major factor in the potential for cancer treatment and must be addressed." And the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry denied there was anything wrong with such donations. "Patient groups and companies have a shared interest. When they work together it is in the patients' interests, usually to do with education programmes or disease awareness. "Any involvement has to be declared by the company so it is quite transparent." watchdog faces legal review 26 Mar 07 | Health Alzheimer's drugs appeal refused 11 Oct 06 | Health Drug 'treats severe Alzheimer's' 23 Mar 06 | Health 'The drug improved both our lives' 10 Oct 06 | Health back folic acid in flour Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Drinking at home 'cuts bingeing'

The General Medical Council (GMC) ruled it had been an "exceptional" case that saw Essex-based Dr June Swinhoe fail in her practise. Marian Howland, 52, from Epping, had not been made aware of risks linked to her operation for a prolapse in 2003. The GMC panel ruled Dr Swinhoe posed no risk to patients. In March 2003, Dr Swinhoe was working as a consultant gynaecologist at King George Hospital in Ilford and privately at Holly House Hospital in Buckhurst Hill. I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily Mrs Howland had been married for eight years when she visited Dr Swinhoe with a prolapse and discomfort during sex. She told the panel she was admitted for the prolapse to be repaired but was not informed of all the side effects or of any risks associated with the procedures. Dr Swinhoe had not taken a full medical history from Mrs Howland who had previously had a hysterectomy, her ovaries removed and become blind in one eye. In tears, Mrs Howland told the panel a few weeks after the operation it became clear she had been left unable to have sex, and had been left "shell-shocked". She added: "I have lost my best friend, my husband, my lover. "I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily." The panel told Dr Swinhoe: "The deficiencies in your communication with Mrs Howland and your failure to obtain consent from her were an aberration and amount to an isolated departure from your usual high standards of professional competence and care. "The finding that your fitness is impaired is, in itself, a very significant mark on your record. "You have learned from this distressing experience. "This is a wholly exceptional case and in the circumstances the panel is satisfied that it is fair, proportionate and sufficient to conclude the case without taking any action in respect of your registration." travel, leisure and more from the BBC website for Essex New lead over Oliver pub robbery Four arrested in drugs house raid Crews tackle fire at listed hotel

Researchers at Sheffield University said their creation could be a huge advantage in war zones. They say that the artificial blood is light to carry, does not need to be kept cool and can be kept for longer. The new blood is made up of plastic molecules that have an iron atom at their core, like haemoglobin, that can carry oxygen through the body. The scientists said the artificial blood could be cheap to produce and they were looking for extra funding to develop a final prototype that would be suitable for biological testing. Dr Lance Twyman, of the university's Department of Chemistry, said: "We are very excited about the potential for this product and about the fact that this could save lives. "Many people die from superficial wounds when they are trapped in an accident or are injured on the battlefield and can't get blood before they get to hospital. "This product can be stored a lot more easily than blood, meaning large quantities could be carried easily by ambulances and the armed forces." A sample of the artificial blood prototype will be on display at the Science Museum in London from 22 May as part of an exhibition about the history of plastics. travel, leisure and more from the BBC website for South Yorkshire NORTH YORKSHIRE STORIES Policeman jailed over child sex Battlefield homes get green light Allotment produce declared safe

Daniel Tuck, from Oldbury, West Midlands, is the first person to be successfully prosecuted under a new law preventing the sale of body parts. The 26-year-old tried to sell his kidney for £24,000 on a chatroom used by kidney disease sufferers. The judge suspended his sentence for two years and ordered him to pay £250. He had faced up to three years in jail for contravening the Human Tissue Act. I want to sell my kidney - this is 100% genuine. I am a white male of completely perfect health. Tuck had previous convictions for theft and obtaining property by deception. Judge Challinor said: "There is much public disquiet surrounding the sale of body parts for money and there is an understandable revulsion at such practices. "A sentence incorporating an element of deterrence is required." Helena Miller, prosecuting, said Tuck admitted a charge of offering to supply human material for transplantation last month. He had posted an advert on the internet which read: "I am a healthy 25-year-old male from Birmingham in England. I am blood group O+ and am desperate for funds to rebuild my life. "I want to sell my kidney - this is 100% genuine. I am a white male of completely perfect health. Why risk getting a kidney from a Third World country?" He was questioned by police after meeting a reporter from the Sunday Mercury newspaper in May 2006 and agreeing a price for the kidney, she said.

The Royal Maternity Hospital closed the unit temporarily to new admissions after the babies became seriously ill. The ward has now been chemically decontaminated. Health Minister Michael McGimpsey said eliminating infections in hospitals was a priority. Dr Stanley Craig said the babies were responding well to antibiotics. "Any infection when you're particularly compromised, as a pre-term baby is, is potentially life-threatening," he said. "These babies are responding to the antibiotics that they're on, which is good news for the babies themselves, their parents and the staff involved in their care. The hospital hopes to re-open the unit next week "Being born premature does leave you very vulnerable to infection and it can be a problem, but we're seeing encouraging signs." The babies, who picked up a multi-resistant enterobacter infection, have been isolated and are being closely monitored by specially trained nurses. The health minister said the situation was not acceptable and pointed out there had been much investment in the area of patient safety. "It is one of the issues that we look at ...and it's one of the areas I take very, very seriously," said Mr McGimpsey. "Obviously when people go to hospital they expect not to pick up infection, when they're there. There is an incidence of infections in hospitals and we look to eliminate that because whatever the incidence is, it is ... too high." Iris Robinson of the DUP said she was concerned about the impact on other hospitals. "What I am particularly concerned about is how the other hospitals across the province are going to deal with demand while the Royal's neonatal unit is out of operation," she said. "Usually the most unwell babies from all around Northern Ireland would be transferred to the specialist unit in Belfast. "Obviously this will not be the case for the immediate future, and these cases will have to be managed in their local units."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6643547.stm Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' 10 May 2007, 23:01 GMT 00:01 'prevents bowel cancer' Aspirin could benefit high-risk groups, the study says Taking aspirin each day can prevent bowel cancer developing, a study says. Oxford University researchers said taking a dose of 300mg a day for five years offered the protection. Long-term aspirin use is generally not backed because of the risk of stomach problems, but the team said it could benefit those at high-risk of cancer. Cancer campaigners welcomed the study - published in the Lancet - which examined data from previous research covering more than 7,500 people. These findings are not an indication that the general population should rush out and take what is a high dosage of aspirin on a daily basis. Each year, around 35,000 men and women in the UK are diagnosed with bowel cancer, and more than 16,000 die from the disease. The researchers looked at the results from two large-scale UK trials carried out in the late 1970s and early 1980s covering over 7,500 people which had given some people 300, 500 or 1,200mg per day doses of aspirin or a dummy pill for five to seven years. The people in the study were then followed for up to 20 years, and deaths from bowel cancer were logged. The team say it takes at least 10 years to see an effect, because that is how long it takes for a pre-cancerous growths to develop into cancer. Other studies have examined aspirin's benefits. However, this was the first where people were allocated to take different doses of the drug, or the fake version, rather than looking back at the aspirin use of bowel cancer patients and comparing them with healthy people. High risk group 'benefit' The researchers found that taking 300mg of aspirin - the equivalent of one pill - a day for five years reduced the incidence of bowel cancer by 74% in the subsequent 10 to 15 years. An accompanying review of 30 observational studies suggested taking medium-to-high doses of aspirin for 10 years or more reduced the risk of developing the disease by 50%-70%. The protective effect of aspirin appeared to be consistent regardless of age, sex, race or country of origin. It was also seen in individuals who had a close family relative with bowel cancer, which normally raises the lifetime risk two to four times. Professor Peter Rothwell, who led the research, said: "What we are saying is that for a subgroup of people at high risk of bowel cancer, they probably aren't going to be dramatically harmed by taking aspirin. "They may have some risk of bleeding in the stomach, but they will see potentially significant benefits in the reduction of their colon cancer risk. "In that situation, I think taking aspirin daily would be worthwhile." Dr Andrew Chan, from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, writing in the Lancet, said the findings were "convincing evidence" that aspirin can reduce the incidence of bowel cancer. But he added: "With the concerns about the potential risks of long-term aspirin use and the availability of alternative prevention strategies - such as screening - these findings are not sufficient to warrant a recommendation for the general population to use aspirin for cancer prevention." Rob Glynne-Jones, chief medical advisor to the charity Bowel Cancer UK, said: "This is very interesting and it certainly confirms what we already know and believe about the links between aspirin, polyps and the development of bowel cancer. "However, these findings are not an indication that the general population should rush out and take what is a high dosage of aspirin on a daily basis. "Aspirin at this dose over a prolonged period of time could lead to potentially serious side effects in a few people."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6644293.stm Call for mental heath care push 11 May 2007, 07:27 GMT 08:27 for mental heath care push Most mental health treatment takes place out of hospitals Mental health services must renew their efforts to improve community care, the mental health tsar says. Professor Louis Appleby has called on NHS trusts to look at new ways of working to help people rebuild lives. He said they should look to work more closely with employment and housing agencies and cut waiting lists for talking therapies in England. Campaigners said there was a lot of work to do to ensure services were good enough for patients. In the last eight years, there has been a big push to move care out of hospitals and into the community. With units and day centres closing and community services cut, the more seriously ill are still being neglected and put at risk Marjorie Wallace, of Sane There are now more than 700 community teams, including nurses, doctors and social workers, providing a range of crisis help and early intervention. However, the Healthcare Commission last year criticised services, pointing to gaps in out-of-hours care, talking therapies and access to information. Nearly half of services were rated as fair or weak. Professor Appleby said the report was about the next phase of reform of mental health care. He told BBC News: "We've had several years of strengthening what community services do, and the report is about breaking down the barriers in the next stage of reforms. "I'm talking about barriers that get in the way of better patients' experience of care "At the moment, for example, there is a barrier between what health services traditionally do, which is clinical care, improving people's illnesses, abolishing their symptoms. "But what patients often tell us they want is help with quality of life. They want opportunities for training, for jobs, and for decent housing, and we have to take on that responsibility." His report called on the 60 mental heath trusts to consult with their local populations about what they needed. The report said mental health trusts should look at ways they could link up with agencies responsible for housing and employment. It also called for community teams to get involved in giving people more advice on how to reduce alcohol and drug use and look after their physical health. He also called for a renewed effort to reduce waiting lists for talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which sometimes has waits of over 12 months. The NHS is currently rolling out a programme of providing people with access to computerised CBT and the government has set up 10 pilots to explore ways of speeding up access to talking therapies. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said extra investment was needed. "We are all too aware that with units and day centres closing and community services cut, the more seriously ill are still being neglected and put at risk. "The government goes forward with its policy of reform and choice, but there are thousands who have no choice of where to go in crisis and little chance of rehabilitation or safe, consistent care, both in or out of hospital." urged to help mentally ill Mental health wards 'unpleasant' Mental health services 'failing' Young 'failed' on mental health Fear over health of mentally ill 'My company helped me recover' 'The services were just not there' 'I'm so glad I didn't kill myself' 'I have washed my hands of NHS' 'I learned to live with voices' Kicking depression into touch back folic acid in flour Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Drinking at home 'cuts bingeing'

However, patients may find problems getting Avastin, as the NHS drugs watchdogs have yet to consider whether to sanction its use. The drug is designed to be used in tandem with another chemotherapy agent, paclitaxel. Avastin, which works by starving cancer cells of a blood supply, has previously been used to treat bowel cancer. All breast cancer treatments will have risks and benefits so it is vital women have all the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment options However, the drug was rejected for NHS use in England and Wales for that purpose last year. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) ruled that it was not cost-effective. In trials, breast cancer patients who took Avastin and paclitaxel went an average of 13 months without their cancer growing, compared with an average of 6.7 months for patients who took paclitaxel alone. Professor David Miles, a consultant medical oncologist at the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, Middlesex, said: "This provides some hope for the 13,000 patients a year that are told the devastating news they have metastatic breast cancer which cannot be cured with surgery. "It is an important step forward to have discovered another targeted treatment which can inhibit the growth of breast cancer and as a result increase significantly the time that patients' breast cancer is controlled." Dr Emma Pennery, a nurse consultant at the charity Breast Cancer Care, said women with secondary breast cancer would welcome any treatment that could potentially slow down the progression of their disease. "This announcement means that there is now another treatment option available, adding to the growing range of targeted drugs for breast cancer." Dr Pennery called on the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Medicines Consortium to appraise the drug as soon as possible. Dr Sarah Rawlings, of the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: "The development of targeted therapies like this is an important step forward in cancer treatment. "Avastin is an additional treatment option that will be welcomed by women with metastatic breast cancer, although it's important to remember it might not be suitable for everyone. "All breast cancer treatments will have risks and benefits so it is vital women have all the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment options.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6646581.stm Cancer therapy cuts side effects 11 May 2007, 11:48 GMT 12:48 therapy cuts side effects Chemotherapy can cause nasty side effects Scientists say they have developed a way to deliver lethal drug doses to tumours without causing side-effects, such as nausea and hair loss. The Australian team has used nanotechnology to create tiny particles which specifically attack cancer cells, but leave healthy tissue unaffected. The particles - or mini-cells - are tagged with anti-cancer antibodies so they zero in on their target. The research features in the journal Cancer Cell. There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel It is hoped the technique could treat tumours in the breast, ovaries, colon and lungs. So far it has been used in mice and dogs, and the researchers plan to begin human trials shortly. Traditional chemotherapy typically involves subjecting the patient's entire body to powerful drugs, which can cause a range of severe side-effects. The mini-cells - about one-fifth the size of a normal cell - were created from bacteria cells stripped of their reproductive powers. They were then loaded with cancer drugs, and tagged with antibodies which are attracted to cancerous tumours. Once the cell reaches the cancer, the drug is released directly into the malignant growth. Researcher Jennifer MacDiarmid, from Sydney-based biotechnology company EnGeneIC, said: "There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel." In tests, the technique reduced tumours in animals without side effects - and by using only a very small amount of drug. Dr MacDiarmid said the treatment could potentially be used on any solid tumours. She said the technique potentially paved the way for customised drug cocktails for individual patients. Professor Quentin Pankhurst, of the London Centre for Nanotechnology, said: "The concept of targeted drug delivery is something which has been around for a while and there are many different avenues that have been tested. "This one looks like an interesting and promising one. "I particularly like the fact that these mini-cells, as they call them, seem to be swallowed up by the cancer cells and taken inside the cancer cells, because that is inherently a very powerful way to actually deliver the drug - actually into the cell." control chemotherapy impact 11 Apr 07 | Health Hope over 'new generation' drugs 18 May 06 | Health London Centre for Nanotechnology back folic acid in flour Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Drinking at home 'cuts bingeing'
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/hi/english/static/in_depth/health/2000/heart_disease/default.stm BBC News | Health | Heart Disease The UK has one of the highest rates of death from heart disease in the world - one British adult dies from the disease every three minutes - and stroke is the country's third biggest killer, claiming 70,000 lives each year. Heart attacks occur when blood flow is blocked, often by a blood clot, while strokes are caused either by blocked or burst blood vessels in the brain. A range of other conditions, including heart failure, when blood is not pumped properly around the body, and congenital heart defects can also cause long term problems, and even death, for sufferers. - The blood returns from the lungs to the upper left chamber of the heart where it is again briefly stored until the atrium fills, before flowing on to the left ventricle. - “Impure” or “blue” blood returning from the atrium enters the heart here, where it is held until the atrium - or chamber - fills up. - This is the most powerful chamber of the heart. It pumps the newly oxygenated blood to the rest of the body through the aorta, or main artery. - This powerful pump propels blood into the pulmonary artery, the tube which carries blood to the lungs, where carbon dioxide in the blood is removed and oxygen added.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/4121411.stm Pregnancy timeline 23 December, 2004, 13:42 GMT occurs and a ball of quickly multiplying cells embeds itself in the lining of the uterus. In the UK pregnancy is calculated from the first day of the woman's last period so for as much as three weeks of this first month she might not be actually pregnant. When fertilisation does occur the tiny mass of cells called a blastocyst at this stage embeds itself in the lining of the womb which is already thickening to support it. The mass of cells is developing fast and becomes an embryo. For many women the first sign of pregnancy is a missed period. Shopbought tests are considered largely reliable so the mother-to-be does not have to have her pregnancy confirmed by her GP. If a first test is negative a second one a few days later may prove positive as hormone levels in the urine rise. The embryo officially becomes a foetus. It is about the size of a baked bean and its spine and nervous system begin to form. The foetus already has its own blood system and may be a different blood group from its mother. Blood vessels are forming in what will become the umbilical cord and tiny buds which will become limbs appear. The baby&acute;s heart is beginning to develop. Morning sickness and other side effects of early pregnancy may take hold. Around this time many women find they experience the side-effects of early pregnancy including needing to urinate more often nausea and vomiting and feeling a bit weepy and irritable. All medication including supplements need to be carefully checked as the foetus is undergoing vital development in the first 12 weeks. If the woman has not told her GP or community midwife she is pregnant yet now is a good time to do so. It is quite common to have a first scan at this stage if the woman has had a previous miscarriage or bleeding. An early scan is often done through the vagina and is used to check the pregnancy is not ectopic. It should show up the baby&acute;s heartbeat. The nervous system is also developing rapidly especially the brain. The head gets bigger and eyes form under the skin of the face. The foetus' limbs are growing and look more like arms and legs. All internal organs are developing and becoming more complex. The foetus is about 5cm long with its head tucked onto its chest. It has most its major organs and eyes and ears are developing. A scan at 10-13 weeks is recommended to pin down the date of the pregnancy. The umbilical cord is fully formed providing nourishment and removing waste products. The foetus looks fully human now. By this week the threat of miscarriage is much reduced. Many women announce their pregnancy to friends and colleagues. The foetus is growing in length much more quickly by now it is about eight cm long and weighs about 60 grams. The placenta is now wellformed though it's not yet doing its full job it takes over fully in week 14. The mother is likely to have her first scan this week. The womans uterus is becoming larger and is starting to rise out of the pelvis. The foetus can move its head quite easily. Third of the way through. The average pregnancy lasts 266 days or 280 days from the first day of last period. Screening for Downs syndrome is offered about now. A simple blood test is carried out first then further tests may be offered. On the basis of the blood test results the woman may opt for a Chorionic Villus sample or an amniocentesis which would diagnose or other chromosomal abnormalities. However these diagnostic tests have a small risk of subsequent miscarriage. An alternative to blood tests is a nuchal translucency scan a new scan offered by some larger hospitals. But again an amniocentisis would be required for firm diagnosis. The foetus now has toe and finger nails eyebrows and eyelashes. It is also covered with downy hair. The hair that will cover the baby until the last week or so of pregnancy - called lanugo - starts to form. This hair is very fine more like down and it probably serves as some form of insulation and protection for the skin. The foetus can hear noises from the outside world. By this stage the mother is visibly pregnant and the uterus is rising. By this stage the foetus is moving around a lot - probably enough to be felt. The foetus is now about 15-20cm long and weighs about 300g. Milk teeth have formed in the gums. Half way through pregnancy now. Almost all mothers are offered a routine scan. The foetus develops a waxy coating called vernix. The scan can show the foetus in fine detail and often reveal if the baby is a boy or a girl. However not all hospitals offer to tell parents the sex of the child - and not all parents want to know. The mother may feel short of breath as her uterus pushes against her diaphragm leaving less space for the lungs. The mother may be offered another ultrasound scan around this time. The scan can check the baby&acute;s spine internal organs and growth are normal. Senses develop: taste buds have started to form on the tongue and the foetus starts to feel touch. The skeleton continues to develop and bones that form the skull begin to harden - but not fully. Antenatal checkup and scan to check the baby&acute;s position. A baby born this early does sometimes survive. A baby born at 24 weeks may possibly survive but it would have severe breathing difficulties as its lungs would not be strong enough to cope. It would also be very thin lightweight and susceptible to infections. All organs are now in place and the rest of the pregnancy is for growth. Preeclampsia is a risk from here onwards. This potentially fatal condition causes high blood pressure protein in the urine and swelling caused by fluid retention. The causes are unclear but research suggests it may be linked to an immune reaction to the foetus or the placenta. If the condition is serious women may be advised to take drugs to lower their blood pressure and in some cases an early caesarean or induction may be performed. Serious complications of pregnancy The foetus skin is gradually becoming more opaque than transparent. The foetus measures about 34cm and weighs about 800g. Routine checkup to test for preeclampsia. Women with Rhesus negative blood will also be tested for antibodies. If the mother has Rh negative blood but the baby is Rh positive she can develop antibodies to her baby&acute;s blood during labour. This is not a problem in the first birth but can affect subsequent pregnancies and result in stillbirth. Fortunately treatment is simple and effective. BBC Health: Ask the doctor - Rhesus disease Some women develop restless leg syndrome in their third trimester. This is sensations such as crawling tingling or even cramps and burning inside the foot or leg - often in the evening and at night disturbing sleep and making the mother feel she needs to get up and walk around. No-one knows what causes this harmless but irritating condition. Braxton Hicks contractions may begin around now. They are practice contractions which dont usually hurt. These are irregular, painless contractions which feel like a squeezing sensation near the top of the uterus. If contractions become painful or occur four times an hour or more, the woman should call a doctor as she may be in early labour. The foetus can see now and tell light from dark. The mother&acute;s breasts start to produce colostrum about now This high calorie milk is produced by the mother to feed the baby for the first few days after birth before normal milk starts. Another antenatal appointment. The foetus is about 42cm and weighs 2.2kg. A baby born now has a good chance of survival. From now the baby should become settled in a head downwards position. A midwife can help to move it if necessary. The mother may find it more difficult to eat full meals as the expanded uterus presses on her stomach. If the mother has been told she may need a planned caesarean, now is a good time to discuss it further. The baby&acute;s head may engage in the pelvis any time now. The baby&acute;s lungs are practically mature now and it can survive unaided. The final weeks in the womb are to put on weight. Babies born from this week onward are not considered early. Another ante-natal appointment. The mother has reached her full size and weight by now. In theory the baby should be born this week. The mother&acute;s cervix prepares for the birth by softening. First babies are often up to a week late but if there are signs of distress to mother or child the birth will be induced. week by week guide to what happens to mother and baby during pregnancy Nine months: An overview Experts back folic acid in flour Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Drinking at home 'cuts bingeing' Week at a Glance
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6645479.stm Ireland | Baby unit 'to re-open next week' 11 May 2007, 17:42 GMT 18:42 unit 'to re-open next week' The neonatal unit treats the sickest babies in Northern Ireland A consultant at the neonatal unit in Belfast where three premature babies picked up an infection said it hopes to resume admissions next week. The Royal Maternity Hospital closed the unit temporarily to new admissions after the babies became seriously ill. The ward has now been chemically decontaminated. Health Minister Michael McGimpsey said eliminating infections in hospitals was a priority. Dr Stanley Craig said the babies were responding well to antibiotics. "Any infection when you're particularly compromised, as a pre-term baby is, is potentially life-threatening," he said. "These babies are responding to the antibiotics that they're on, which is good news for the babies themselves, their parents and the staff involved in their care. The hospital hopes to re-open the unit next week "Being born premature does leave you very vulnerable to infection and it can be a problem, but we're seeing encouraging signs." The babies, who picked up a multi-resistant enterobacter infection, have been isolated and are being closely monitored by specially trained nurses. The health minister said the situation was not acceptable and pointed out there had been much investment in the area of patient safety. "It is one of the issues that we look at ...and it's one of the areas I take very, very seriously," said Mr McGimpsey. "Obviously when people go to hospital they expect not to pick up infection, when they're there. There is an incidence of infections in hospitals and we look to eliminate that because whatever the incidence is, it is ... too high." Iris Robinson of the DUP said she was concerned about the impact on other hospitals. "What I am particularly concerned about is how the other hospitals across the province are going to deal with demand while the Royal's neonatal unit is out of operation," she said. "Usually the most unwell babies from all around Northern Ireland would be transferred to the specialist unit in Belfast. "Obviously this will not be the case for the immediate future, and these cases will have to be managed in their local units."

If not included, a element must be specified. is the number of bytes of the media object. the standard MIME type of the object. the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable).

Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared.

An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module. A movie review with a trailer, using a Creative Commons license. My Movie Review Site Movie Title: Is this a good movie?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6644293.stm Call for mental heath care push 11 May 2007, 07:27 GMT 08:27 for mental heath care push Most mental health treatment takes place out of hospitals Mental health services must renew their efforts to improve community care, the mental health tsar says. Professor Louis Appleby has called on NHS trusts to look at new ways of working to help people rebuild lives. He said they should look to work more closely with employment and housing agencies and cut waiting lists for talking therapies in England. Campaigners said there was a lot of work to do to ensure services were good enough for patients. In the last eight years, there has been a big push to move care out of hospitals and into the community. With units and day centres closing and community services cut, the more seriously ill are still being neglected and put at risk Marjorie Wallace, of Sane There are now more than 700 community teams, including nurses, doctors and social workers, providing a range of crisis help and early intervention. However, the Healthcare Commission last year criticised services, pointing to gaps in out-of-hours care, talking therapies and access to information. Nearly half of services were rated as fair or weak. Professor Appleby said the report was about the next phase of reform of mental health care. He told BBC News: "We've had several years of strengthening what community services do, and the report is about breaking down the barriers in the next stage of reforms. "I'm talking about barriers that get in the way of better patients' experience of care "At the moment, for example, there is a barrier between what health services traditionally do, which is clinical care, improving people's illnesses, abolishing their symptoms. "But what patients often tell us they want is help with quality of life. They want opportunities for training, for jobs, and for decent housing, and we have to take on that responsibility." His report called on the 60 mental heath trusts to consult with their local populations about what they needed. The report said mental health trusts should look at ways they could link up with agencies responsible for housing and employment. It also called for community teams to get involved in giving people more advice on how to reduce alcohol and drug use and look after their physical health. He also called for a renewed effort to reduce waiting lists for talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which sometimes has waits of over 12 months. The NHS is currently rolling out a programme of providing people with access to computerised CBT and the government has set up 10 pilots to explore ways of speeding up access to talking therapies. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said extra investment was needed. "We are all too aware that with units and day centres closing and community services cut, the more seriously ill are still being neglected and put at risk. "The government goes forward with its policy of reform and choice, but there are thousands who have no choice of where to go in crisis and little chance of rehabilitation or safe, consistent care, both in or out of hospital." urged to help mentally ill Mental health wards 'unpleasant' Mental health services 'failing' Young 'failed' on mental health Fear over health of mentally ill 'My company helped me recover' 'The services were just not there' 'I'm so glad I didn't kill myself' 'I have washed my hands of NHS' 'I learned to live with voices' Kicking depression into touch back folic acid in flour Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Drinking at home 'cuts bingeing'
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/3444635.stm Cancer: The facts 30 January 2004, 11:57 GMT in three of us will be diagnosed with cancer during our life. The disease tends to affect older people - but can strike at any time. Excluding certain skin cancers, there were more than 270,000 new cases of the disease in 2001 - and the rate is increasing by about 1% a year. Some cancer, such as breast, are becoming more common, while new cases of lung cancer fall away due to the drop in the number of smokers. However, while the overall number of new cancers is not falling, the good news is that successful treatment rates for many of the most common types are improving rapidly. BBC News Online has produced, in conjunction with Cancer Research UK, a guide to some of the most common forms of cancer and the treatments used to tackle them.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6648059.stm Experts back folic acid in flour 11 May 2007, 17:03 GMT 18:03 back folic acid in flour Under the plan, all bread would be made with folic acid-fortified flour The UK's official food watchdog is backing the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid to reduce birth defects such as spina bifida. The proposal will go before the board of the Food Standards Agency next week for ratification. If passed, ministers will then decide whether to press ahead. Scientific research shows that folic acid significantly cuts the risk of neural tube defects, which affect up to 900 pregnancies a year in the UK. However, there is concern that adding the vitamin to flour could harm some elderly patients, as it could mask a deficiency in the B12 vitamin. Up to 10% of those aged 65 and older have borderline B12 levels and could tip into deficiency. In extreme cases, this can cause irreversible damage to the nervous system. The recommendation to the FSA board suggests that products containing folic acid at nutritionally significant levels should be clearly labelled. It also argues that mandatory fortification should be accompanied by new controls on the voluntary addition of folic acid to other products, such as breakfast cereals and low-fat spreads, and on the use of folic acid supplements. A system for monitoring the health impact of fortification would also be needed. Wholemeal flour would be exempt from fortification in order to give consumers more choice. The FSA already advises women to eat extra folic acid when trying to get pregnant. However, research suggests that only half of such women adhere to this advice. Also, up to half of pregnancies are unplanned, meaning women may miss the opportunity. Each year between 500 and 600 babies in the UK are reported to have neural tube defects. It is thought many of the other affected pregnancies are terminated. Mandatory fortification has already been introduced in the USA, Canada and Chile, where it cut NTD rates by between 27% and 50%. A panel of UK experts, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), last year backed mandatory fortification of flour. SACN found no evidence that vitamin B12 deficiency was masked in older people, provided folic acid doses were 1mg a day or less. An FSA consultation on the issue drew 202 responses from industry, consumer groups and individuals. The baking industry raised "practical concerns" about the fortification of bread. It said bread-making flour couldn't easily be separated from other flours in mills. acid 'should be in flour' 12 Dec 06 | Health Folic acid boosts IVF twin births 05 May 06 | Health Folic acid 'cuts dementia risk' 15 Aug 05 | Health Push to add folic acid to bread 05 Apr 06 | Health Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Scientific Advisory Committee of Nutrition back folic acid in flour Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Drinking at home 'cuts bingeing'
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6641811.stm | Toddlers to get help with talking 10 May 2007, 10:28 GMT 11:28 to get help with talking One in 10 children have a communication disability Toddlers are to get help learning how to talk in a bid to cut the numbers of children starting school with poor language skills for their age. Half of children enter primary school unable to speak as well as they are expected to, research suggests. The Early Talk programme which uses gestures, symbols and signing to expand vocabulary, is being piloted in 200 government-backed children's centres. It will also be used to target youngsters with potential difficulties. Television doesn't respond well to children. ICAN head of Early Years Clare Geldard, head of Early Years for the charity behind the programme, I CAN, said there were concerns that the number of pre-school children with speech and language difficulties was on the rise. "We don't know why this is the case and I am sure there are a myriad of reasons. "We know that television can be used in a really productive way in terms of watching a piece of television and then having a conversation about it afterwards, but we also know that television doesn't respond well to children. "It does not give them the interactivity that children and adults instinctively seek from adults." She said the Early Talk programme was about ensuring that nursery staff, childminders and parents had the basic skills they needed to enhance children's speech, language and communication. "Everybody needs to have a basic knowledge about what we can do to enhance children's speech and language development," she said. But it was also about ensuring that those children who had the potential to go on to develop speech and language difficulties were picked up early and given the help they need. I CAN's chief executive Virginia Beardshaw said one in 10 children across the UK were thought to have a communication disability. She added that the Early Talk programme, which will ultimately be rolled out to 3,000 Sure Start children's centres, would foster environments "where communication is embedded". This would range from using pictures, symbols and gestures to teach vocabulary to using group work and specialist help from speech and language therapists, she said. Children's minister Beverley Hughes said: "Communication is a vital skill in life and we want to help all children communicate better and reap the rewards of that later in life. "This is especially important for children who have trouble communicating - particularly those with a communication disability - who are much more likely to develop behavioural and learning problems." She said she hoped the partnership being announced would play a vital role in identifying children's difficulties at an early stage. Nursery and children's centre staff will be given training and packages of support to help ensure children's language skills are polished and it is hoped this will be passed on to parents and children's carers. skills 'cut re-offending' 05 May 07 | Health 'Double blow' for autistic pupils 16 Apr 07 | Education Autism 'more common than thought' 13 Jul 06 | Health 'Two languages' call for children 21 Feb 07 | Edinburgh and East papers tagged to beat cheats Summer school programme grows City teachers could get more cash

If not included, a element must be specified. is the number of bytes of the media object. the standard MIME type of the object. the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable). While this attribute can at times seem redundant if is supplied, it is included because it simplifies decision making on the reader side, as well as flushes out any ambiguities between MIME type and object type. if this is the default object that should be used for the . There should only be one default object per . if the object is a sample or the full version of the object, or even if it is a continuous stream (sample | full | nonstop). Default value is 'full'. the kilobits per second rate of media. the number of frames per second for the media object. the number of samples per second taken to create the media object. It is expressed in thousands of samples per second (kHz). number of audio channels in the media object. the number of seconds the media object plays. the height of the media object. the width of the media object. the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared.

If the media is operating under a Creative Commons license, the Creative Commons module should be used instead. the inclusion of a text transcript, closed captioning, or lyrics of the media content. Many of these elements are permitted to provide a time series of text.

All html must be entity-encoded. the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site.

University College London researchers studied 8,000 people, says the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. They found those with a profound sense of injustice had a 55% higher chance of suffering serious heart disease. Experts believe a sense of unfairness engenders negative emotions which may prompt biochemical changes in the body. I understand that this is a long shot, but the key message is that we must try to promote fairness in society However, lead researcher Dr Roberto de Vogli said more research was needed to confirm the mechanism linking unfairness to health. The team looked at a study of 8,000 senior civil servants working for the UK government. However, they were not assessing unfairness experienced at work and used statistics to remove the effects of this factor, and of risk factors such as obesity and smoking, from their tests. The results showed that unfair treatment in other aspects of life was linked to increased risk of heart disease. The civil servants were asked how strongly - on a scale of one to six - they agreed with the statement: "I often have the feeling that I am being treated unfairly." Their mental and physical health was then tracked for an average of almost 11 years. The results showed the more unfair treatment people reported, the greater their risk of suffering a heart attack or angina. Dr de Vogli said perception of unfairness in all areas was important. "I understand that this is a long shot, but the key message is that we must try to promote fairness in society." Neil Poulter, professor of preventive cardiovascular medicine at Imperial College London, said: "I would think that if you are treated unfairly by society then that would be a likely stress factor which could adversely affect your health." But he warned it was difficult to separate the effects of unfairness from other risk factors. disease risks re-assessed 08 Nov 06 | Tayside and Central How stress can strain the heart 10 Apr 07 | Health Modern life puts stress on heart 20 Apr 07 | Health Unfair bosses raise blood pressure 23 Jun 03 | Health BBC Guide: Heart Disease Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health to tackle cancer by 2020 Doctor application system ditched Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' soap opera grips Paris Get slim on the office treadmill tool offers 'easy' coding Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' evidence' for Algarve arrest New doubt cast on Woolmer murder US evangelist Jerry Falwell dies New Media Home: The Conclusion the bohemian spirit live on when jazz clubs go smoke-free?

Peers examined links between flights and health in 2000 and found there was insufficient proof of any major risks, but urged more research in the area. After huge growth in air travel, peers want to know what has been done to improve conditions and on research. They will also look at how to limit the spread of newer threats, like SARS and pandemic influenza. The Lords Science and Technology Committee's previous report, Air Travel and Health, attempted to raise public understanding of deep vein thrombosis, oxygen depletion, cross-infection and cabin air contamination. It highlighted the need for more research into health risks and to improve information for passengers. The new investigation will look at what progress has been made, what new health threats have emerged and how effective the government's Aviation Health Working Group have been. Committee chairman Lord Broers said there had been major growth in the aviation industry since 2000, and public concern about possible health risks was "still high". air travel clot risk theory 10 Mar 06 | Health Sars changing air travel 26 Apr 03 | Asia-Pacific Ministers create air health unit 06 Mar 03 | Health Long-haul victim's family seek inquiry 25 Mar 01 | Wales rival needs more supporters Jail threat over illegal workers Parties discussing funding review soap opera grips Paris Get slim on the office treadmill tool offers 'easy' coding Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' evidence' for Algarve arrest New doubt cast on Woolmer murder US evangelist Jerry Falwell dies New Media Home: The Conclusion the bohemian spirit live on when jazz clubs go smoke-free?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6655221.stm Alzheimer's drug's impact hailed 14 May 2007, 23:55 GMT 00:55 drug's impact hailed The drugs are reserved for those with moderate Alzheimer's Alzheimer's drugs currently being denied to some NHS patients may have a dramatic impact on the pathology of the brain, research in the UK indicates. Neurology says that post-mortem tests on 24 patients found a 70% fall of a protein linked to dementia in those who had taken cholinesterase inhibitors. Campaigners are fighting to get the drugs available on the NHS after they were rejected for use in mild cases. Experts said the study was interesting but small and inconclusive as a result. Post-mortem examinations were done on 12 patients who took part in UK trials of the drugs - donepezil, rivastigmine, tacrine and galantamine. We knew there may be some reduction in the levels of beta-amyloid among people prescribed cholinesterase drugs, but the sheer magnitude of the reduction was a real surprise Professor Clive Ballard, study leader Professor Clive Ballard, director of research at the Alzheimer's Society, and colleagues measured the concentrations of two proteins associated with the build up of plaques found in the brains with people with dementia. The results were compared with 12 patients studied before cholinesterase drugs were available. Deposits of one of the proteins - beta amyloid - in the plaques were 70% lower in the brains of people who received the drugs in the trial. There was no difference in amounts of the other protein known as tau. Professor Ballard said: "We knew there may be some reduction in the levels of beta-amyloid among people prescribed cholinesterase drugs, but the sheer magnitude of the reduction was a real surprise. "The study looked at dementia with Lewy bodies but beta-amyloid is also a hallmark in Alzheimer's disease. "The results suggest that if we want to slow down the progression of these diseases the earlier we start prescribing these treatments the better." Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 2001 recommended donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine should be used as standard. But in November the watchdog announced people with newly diagnosed, mild Alzheimer's were exempt. The Alzheimer's Society is set to go to the High Court next month as part of a judicial review of the decision. Neil Hunt, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Society, added: "People with Alzheimer's disease and their carers have known about the life-changing benefits of these drugs for some time now and this study provides the first hard evidence of the physical benefits of the same treatments." But Dr Declan McCloughlin, senior lecturer in the Medical Research Council Centre for Neurodegeneration, said there could be other explanations for the findings. "This is a very interesting but preliminary finding which could have happened by chance because the sample groups are small. "We know from clinical trials the drugs have modest benefits and so if they have an effect on the underlying molecular pathology it's not a very big effect. "But is shows there may be some improvement in one of the key pathologies of the disease." Rebecca Wood, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, said: "Although the scientists looked at Lewy Body disease rather than Alzheimer's, the two conditions have much in common and this study shows how a class of drugs, restricted by NICE for so-called performance reasons, do help to prevent the physical progression of dementia." drugs appeal refused 11 Oct 06 | Health Drug 'treats severe Alzheimer's' 23 Mar 06 | Health 'The drug improved both our lives' 10 Oct 06 | Health to tackle cancer by 2020 Doctor application system ditched Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' soap opera grips Paris Get slim on the office treadmill tool offers 'easy' coding Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' evidence' for Algarve arrest New doubt cast on Woolmer murder US evangelist Jerry Falwell dies New Media Home: The Conclusion the bohemian spirit live on when jazz clubs go smoke-free?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/6655181.stm | West Yorkshire | Tomlinson in 'fake cancer' abuse 14 May 2007, 16:04 GMT 17:04 in 'fake cancer' abuse Jane Tomlinson is now too ill to train for more physical challenges Terminal cancer sufferer and charity fundraiser Jane Tomlinson said she has been subjected to abuse from people who question her illness. The radiographer from Leeds, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000, has raised about £1.5m through a series of gruelling physical challenges. But in an ITV documentary to be broadcast on Tuesday Mrs Tomlinson, 43, reveals some people doubt her illness. She said abusive phone callers had accused her of "faking" cancer. Mrs Tomlinson reveals in the programme how one caller said: "You are nothing but a ... fraud. You no more have cancer than I have." She added that her family had taken several phone calls from more than one person, but one caller in particular had been quite unpleasant. Just because I smile through it, it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt Mrs Tomlinson has drawn praise from across the world for her feats of endurance, including a 4,200-mile bike ride across America, taking part in the Florida Iron Man contest and cycling from Rome to her home in Leeds, West Yorkshire. "I have heard people say I can't possibly be ill and do the things I do and there can be nothing further from the truth. "Yes, I am very ill and yes, I have done the things I have done and no it hasn't been easy, and just because I smile through it, it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt because it does - it hurts an awful lot." Mrs Tomlinson's husband Mike told the programme: "I think if we weren't raising money we wouldn't do it because it is way too big a price for an individual family to pay. "We have been really lucky - she's lived 14 times longer than we expected." Mrs Tomlinson said she was now too ill to train for further challenges, but said she was supporting the "Run for All" event, a 10-kilometre run in Leeds on 24 June.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6653679.stm Breastfeeding advice 'is ignored' 14 May 2007, 12:30 GMT 13:30 advice 'is ignored' Breastfeeding is becoming more common Fewer than one in a hundred women follow government advice to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months, figures show. The Infant Feeding Survey shows in 2005 76% of UK mothers started out breastfeeding - up 7% from 2000. However, most resort to formula within weeks, and fewer than half still breastfeed by the time their child is six weeks old. By six months, just one in four are still breastfeeding. Women need to be able to feel confident and comfortable to breastfeed wherever they need to The survey, which has been carried out every five years since 1975, also found that well educated, professional women aged over 30 who were first time mothers were the most likely group to breastfeed. Professor Denise Lievesley, of the Information Centre, which produced the study, said the overall message was positive as more women were breastfeeding for longer. She said the survey would help health workers to target resources at those on which they would have the most impact. "Overall, it is encouraging to see that more mothers than ever before are starting out breastfeeding their babies and, while there is a sharp drop-off, more are continuing to breastfeed for longer." The figures were released on the first day of National Breastfeeding Week, which will see the launch of a breasteeding manifesto in Westminster on Wednesday. Breastfed babies five times less likely to end up in hospital than formula-fed babies with gastroenteritis Breastfed babies half as likely to end up in hospital with respiratory disease in their first seven years of life Breast milk protects against diabetes and obesity The manifesto, supported by 183 MPs and various celebrities, aims to promote breastfeeding and create an environment in which women feel more comfortable about doing so. Alison Baum, from the Breastfeeding Manifesto Coalition, said: "Women need to be able to feel confident and comfortable to breastfeed wherever they need to. "Babies need to feed at all sorts of times, and you can never know when a baby is going to need to feed "It's the most natural thing in the world, and the evidence for the health benefits are huge, so we should be doing all we can to support women." She said most women who breastfed in public did so discreetly, with people not realising. But she said: "There are the odd cases where women are thrown out of restaurants and cafes." It is illegal in Scotland to ask someone to stop breatsfeeding in an establishment that normally serves food. down may help breastfeeding 01 May 07 | Health 11 Dec 06 | Health Breastfeeding 'kills baby's pain' 19 Jul 06 | Health Breastfeeding 'good for mothers' 23 Nov 05 | Health Royal College of Nursing to tackle cancer by 2020 Doctor application system ditched Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' soap opera grips Paris Get slim on the office treadmill tool offers 'easy' coding Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' evidence' for Algarve arrest New doubt cast on Woolmer murder US evangelist Jerry Falwell dies New Media Home: The Conclusion the bohemian spirit live on when jazz clubs go smoke-free?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/england/dorset/6653717.stm | Dorset | Revolutionary treatment for girl 14 May 2007, 11:38 GMT 12:38 treatment for girl Shonia will need physiotherapy and speech therapy The parents of an eight-year-old girl with cerebral palsy are hoping to send their daughter to China for a revolutionary new treatment. Kishor and Pita Tahiliani from Bournemouth in Dorset are planning for their daughter, Vaishnavi, to have stem cells injected into her spinal cord. The treatment, which is not available in the UK, has been credited with helping other cerebral palsy sufferers. The couple will have to raise £18,000 for two months' therapy in Beijing. Cerebral palsy is caused by bad oxygen supply to the brain at the time of birth. The treatment at Tiantan Puhua Neurosurgical Hospital involves injecting stem cells from the umbilical cords of healthy babies into the spinal cord fluid of the cerebral palsy sufferer. The cells then flow directly into the brain where they develop into new cells and repair some of the damage. Mr Tahiliani, 34, said: "This is the best treatment for her. There are cerebral palsy children who were totally blind and now they can see, that's in Mexico. "My wife spoke to an American woman. They were crying on the phone, her child is able to do what a normal child does. I think it will open so many doors for children "He used to get fits before, all the epilepsy fits have gone, he was unable to walk and he is walking now. "There are so many children who have improved. It's amazing really." Vaishnavi, who is known as Shonia, cannot speak, sit or walk. Her parents hope the treatment will help her to live a fuller life. Mr Tahiliani and his wife discovered the ground-breaking therapy through research on the internet. Mr Tahiliani said: "I think many parents are still not aware of this revolutionary treatment and what it's doing for others. "China are quite advanced in this field. The UK has fallen behind at the moment. Research is still in its early stages here, it will be 2010 before it comes into action. "I think it will open so many doors for children." photos and sport from the BBC's Dorset website BBC Health - Cerebral Palsy Tiantan Puhua Neurosurgical Hospital National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke arrested after man stabbed Next of kin sought for dead man Hardy heritage cottages for sale soap opera grips Paris Get slim on the office treadmill tool offers 'easy' coding Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' evidence' for Algarve arrest New doubt cast on Woolmer murder US evangelist Jerry Falwell dies New Media Home: The Conclusion the bohemian spirit live on when jazz clubs go smoke-free?

Juan Maeso, 65, infected 275 people between 1988 and 1997, by injecting himself with a morphine syringe before using the rest on a patient. Valencia's Provincial Court sentenced Mr Maeso, who is a morphine addict, to 1,933 years in jail. However the most he can serve under Spanish law is 20 years. He was also ordered to pay 500,000 euros ($680,000) in damages to each of the victims or their survivors. Mr Maeso is said to have infected patients when he worked in four hospitals in the Valencia area. Four of those he infected with the virus have since died.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/england/cornwall/6658511.stm | Cornwall | Lesbian nurses win sacking payout 15 May 2007, 14:55 GMT 15:55 nurses win sacking payout Margaret Durman and Penny Smith say their lives have been ruined. Picture: Western Morning News Two lesbian nurses have won a six-figure compensation claim after they were sacked because of their sexuality, it has emerged. Margaret Durman and Penny Smith were dismissed from a Cornish care centre because of an unfounded complaint they allowed residents to be abused. They won their case for sexual orientation discrimination at a tribunal last year. Last month care home owner Barchester Healthcare lost its appeal. Ms Durman and Ms Smith, from Kelly Bray, Cornwall, were sacked in 2005 from Kernow House in Launceston, following an internal inquiry by Barchester Healthcare. Barchester had a total disregard not only for employment law...but also the health and welfare of their staff who they assumed were guilty from the outset Sue Matthews, Royal College of Nursing But the tribunal found that if the original anonymous complaint against the pair had been investigated properly "it would have revealed no possible cause for concern". The report added: "We are not satisfied that a heterosexual couple would have been treated the same." Ms Durman, 55, who has been a registered nurse for 35 years and Ms Smith, 41, a psychiatric nurse, said as a result of the allegations both of them had needed counselling and had suffered panic attacks. Ms Durman said: "This has ruined both our professional lives and our private lives. "Because of the ongoing hearings and appeals we have not been able to work at all. "We have had no apology from Barchester Healthcare." Sue Matthews, regional officer for the Royal College of Nursing, who represented the nurses, said: "Barchester had a total disregard not only for employment law and good practice, but also the health and welfare of their staff who they assumed were guilty from the outset." Barchester Healthcare said its procedures had been reviewed as a result of the tribunal.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6653013.stm Antidepressant prescribing soars 14 May 2007, 09:01 GMT 10:01 are not recommended for mild depression The number of prescriptions for antidepressants in England has hit a record high despite national guidance advocating alternative treatments. More than 31 million prescriptions for drugs such as Prozac were issued in 2006 - a 6% rise on the year before. The figures come as two studies showed "startling" benefits of country walks in people with depression. Mind, the charity that reported the findings, said GPs should consider "ecotherapy" as a valid alternative. The National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence issued guidance in 2004 recommending that antidepressants should not be used as first-line therapy for mild to moderate depression. Instead patients should be offered guided self-help and psychological therapies in the first instance. But figures from the Information Centre indicate the number of prescriptions for antidepressants are still on the rise. In particular prescriptions for a group of drugs known as SSRIs, which include Prozac, rose by 10% last year from 14.7m to 16.2m. There have been fears that the drugs are linked to suicidal thoughts and self-harm in some cases. In 2003, experts said SSRI antidepressants should not be given to teenagers after experts' concerns they made some patients suicidal. However, Prozac is still recommended for under-18s, as it is thought that the benefits of taking this particular drug outweigh any potential risk, but only for those with severe depression. Mind, the mental health charity, say the UK is trailing behind other countries in the use of other therapies. In the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Austria, Belgium and Slovenia, patients with depression are prescribed agricultural work. Holland has 600 care farms that are part of the health service compared with 43 in the UK none of which are aimed at mental health. In a report on ecotherapy, Mind said 93% of GPs have prescribed drugs due to lack of alternatives. Ecotherapy, described as getting outdoors and getting active in a green environment, should be considered as a treatment option they said. Researchers at the University of Essex compared a walk in a country park with a walk in a shopping centre in a study of 20 people. They found 71% reported decreased levels of depression after a country walk compared with 45% after a shopping centre walk. Participants also felt much less tense and reported greatly increased self esteem after a green walk. But after a walk in a shopping centre, 50% said their feelings of tension increased and 44% said their self-esteem decreased after the walk in a shopping centre. A separate survey of 108 people who regularly take part in green activities run by local Mind associations found 90% said it was the combination of nature and exercise that had the greatest effect on them and 94% said green activities had lifted their depression. Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind said ecotherapy was a credible, clinically-valid treatment option and needs to be prescribed by GPs especially as access to treatments other than antidepressants was extremely limited. "We're not saying that ecotherapy can replace drugs but the debate needs to be broadened." Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity SANE, said: "GPs are now encouraged to diagnose depression yet without the availability of qualified counsellors and therapists they have little choice but to hand out a prescription - or send the patient away empty-handed, leaving them with less hope of treatment and recovery." The NHS is currently rolling out a programme of providing people with access to computerised CBT and the government has set up 10 pilots to explore ways of speeding up access to talking therapies. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said: "Central to our efforts is the ability for people who are ill to be able to quickly get the right kind of therapy, instead of being prescribed medication." They added the demonstration sites were showing early signs that quick access to therapy reduced the time that patients are ill and helps individuals to regain their independence. Professor Mayur Lakhani, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: "We reject the suggestion that GPs prescribe antidepressants too readily. "GPs consider the need for antidepressants only after a careful assessment of the patients¿ clinical condition. "The real story is the lack of access to services such as talking therapies and the long waiting lists for these. GPs find themselves in a difficult position because of limited services."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6654327.stm | Boost for N-test veterans' case 14 May 2007, 15:12 GMT 16:12 for N-test veterans' case Servicemen claim they were not given adequate protection New research shows an apparent link between British nuclear tests in the South Pacific in the 1950s and genetic defects seen in veterans. Massey University in New Zealand said changes to veterans' chromosomes could be attributed to their participation in the tests at Christmas Island. Lawyers for British veterans who served there said the study strengthened their claim against the Ministry of Defence. The MoD, which has denied the claim, said it would review the new findings. More than 700 veterans - 400 from the UK and 300 Commonwealth colleagues from New Zealand and Fiji - are currently in the middle of legal proceedings to claim compensation from the UK government. Many of them have claimed they were not given suitable protective clothing during the detonation of nuclear devices in the testing - codenamed Operation Grapple - between 1952 and 1962. Rosenblatts, the London legal firm acting on the veterans' behalf, claim the troops were exposed to significant doses of radioactive material, which has directly led to many of them contracting severe illnesses including cancers. The study by Massey University was carried out on 50 of the New Zealand military personnel who took part in Operation Grapple. DNA tests discovered they had a much higher than expected level of translocation - a chromosome defect which can lead to cancer and other illnesses. The scientists concluded that the probable cause was radiation exposure. Rosenblatts is now calling for similar tests to be carried out on the veterans from the UK. Clive Hyer, the senior supervising partner, said: "The case is progressing and we are extremely pleased with the outcome of this report. This is the last piece of the evidential jigsaw puzzle that we needed." A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: "The Ministry of Defence remains open to new scientific or medical evidence concerning nuclear test veterans and we are reviewing the findings of this latest study. "Previous independent reports have concluded that there is no evidence of excess illness or mortality among the veterans as a group which could be linked to their participation in the tests or exposure to radiation." for nuclear veteran 25 Jul 06 | Staffordshire Veterans hoping for compensation 02 Mar 05 | Cornwall Legal help for nuclear test veterans 10 Jul 02 | UK Australia probes nuclear test claims 14 May 07 | Asia-Pacific Servicemen exposed to radiation 12 May 01 | UK British Nuclear Test Veterans Association evidence' for Algarve arrest Brown rival needs more supporters Three held over 7/7 attacks freed soap opera grips Paris Get slim on the office treadmill tool offers 'easy' coding Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' evidence' for Algarve arrest New doubt cast on Woolmer murder US evangelist Jerry Falwell dies New Media Home: The Conclusion the bohemian spirit live on when jazz clubs go smoke-free?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6657485.stm Doctor application system ditched 15 May 2007, 11:38 GMT 12:38 application system ditched Some doctors want the whole recruitment process scrapped The controversial system used to match junior doctors to specialist training posts has been shelved by ministers. Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt said that after the first round of recruitment, the system would only fulfill a monitoring role this year. Instead, the subsequent recruitment rounds will be CV-based, and handled at a local level by medical deaneries. Doctors had complained the system was profoundly flawed, and that many juniors had been unfairly treated. This was the only option on offer - which they have presented as a decision Dr Matt Jamieson Evans Juniors had to apply for a job through a system known as the medical training application service (MTAS). But the system ran into serious trouble with many complaining about a lack of posts, poorly designed recruitment forms and technical failures with the online application system. The doctors were angry about the way everyone was made to apply for training places at the same time, rather than the old rolling recruitment process which allowed them to keep on trying for jobs as they came up. They feared those who missed out in the first round of recruitment would not be able to get back on the career ladder towards becoming a consultant. It also emerged that the MTAS website had been the subject of two security breaches. The Department of Health has at last seen sense and effectively abandoned the unfair, discredited, and shambolic MTAS system Ms Hewitt told the Commons earlier this month she was confident that criminal offences had not been committed. But following further investigations a report has been sent to the police. A campaign group of doctors, Remedy UK, has launched a legal challenge with the aim of getting the whole recruitment process scrapped. However, ministers are committed to seeing through the first round of the recruitment process. They said every eligible applicant in the first round had now been guaranteed at least one interview for their first preference post, and as a result an additional 15,500 interviews had been arranged, and were now taking place. Only doctors who fail in the first round of recruitment will go to second and subsequent rounds. The British Medical Association welcomed the decision to suspend the use of MTAS. Dr Andrew Rowland, vice chairman of the BMA Junior Doctors Committee, said: "The Department of Health has at last seen sense and effectively abandoned the unfair, discredited, and shambolic MTAS system. The recruitment system has been an unfair mess from start to finish. Send us your comments "Junior doctors have suffered blow after blow because of the government's terrible handling of these reforms. "They have had to go through months of anxiety about their NHS careers, and on top of that, have potentially had their personal details exposed on the MTAS website." However, Dr Rowland said the BMA remained opposed to the Remedy UK legal challenge, saying that scrapping the first round of applications would be disastrous for doctors, for patients, and for the NHS. "Forcing people to re-apply for jobs through yet another new and untested system would be unfair on the junior doctors and consultants who have had to spend huge amounts of time and energy on MTAS." Dr Matt Jamieson Evans, a spokesman for Remedy UK, was unimpressed by the government move, which he called a "grandiose smokescreen statement" intended to divert attention away from the fact that thousands of doctors had suffered at the hands of MTAS. He said: "The system has been down for weeks. "I fail to see how they could have envisaged using it. This was the only option on offer - which they have presented as a decision." A review of MTAS will decide whether the system should be reinstated in future years. application system ditched Recruitment row 'risks patients' Hewitt attacked over jobs website Doctors' job website suspended Doctor training 'security lapse' Trainee doctors 'will go abroad' Rescue plan for doctors leaked Doctors' training review planned Doctors 'need training guarantee' Doctors training crisis 'averted' Hewitt apology for training chaos Doctors abandon talks on job row Review into doctor recruitment Jobs protest planned by doctors Q&A: Junior doctor job row 'I'm leaving for New Zealand' What could jobless doctors do?

Consumer group Which? questioned more than 300 people and warned that getting independent advice was vital. The UK's cosmetic surgery industry is predicted to double in size between now and 2012 - more than 700,000 cosmetic procedures were carried out in 2006. A cosmetic surgeons' group agreed it was important GPs played a bigger role. It is quite shocking that people will trust adverts in magazines but won't consult their GP before they decide to have cosmetic treatments While many cosmetic operations are minor in nature, carried out under local anaesthetic, some are classed as major operations, and carry a significant risk of complications or poor results. Which? is campaigning for both an improvement in the information available to patients considering cosmetic surgery on these risks. It also wants a mandatory "cooling-off period" following any decision to go ahead with an operation, and has set up a website to offer advice to would-be patients. Spokesman Frances Blunden said: "It is quite shocking that people will trust adverts in magazines but won't consult their GP before they decide to have cosmetic treatments. "It's not a decision to take lightly, particularly as, in some cases, people will undergo a major operation which obviously involves risks that should be talked through with their own, impartial doctor first." The survey found many patients were more likely to take the advice of friends and family, or rely on internet or magazine articles, than consult a GP. We would always advise a patient to discuss matters with their GP first if possible Many of those who stayed away from their GP surgery said that other people had told them it "wouldn't be helpful", or said they had had a bad experience with their GP previously. The Department of Health also recommends that people considering cosmetic surgery procedures talk to their GP first, because they may be able to offer general advice about surgery, and any health problems which should be mentioned to the cosmetic surgeon prior to the operation. Hamish Laing, the Honorary Secretary of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (Bapras), said he recognised that it was increasingly common for patients to choose to "self-refer" to a plastic surgeon. He said: "We would always advise a patient to discuss matters with their GP first if possible. "If they are unwilling or unable to do so, then the specialist should seek the patient's permission to write to the GP at the end of the first consultation to make the GP aware of it. "The GP will be able to ensure that an appropriately trained and registered specialist is seen. "In making the referral the GP will be able to tell the specialist of any medical or other contraindications that the patient might have to surgery." warn on salon treatments 11 May 07 | Health Young 'hung up on their bodies' 20 Feb 07 | Health Women over 40 'hate' their bodies 01 Aug 06 | Health Pensioners turn to plastic surgery 03 Mar 07 | Health Plastic surgery 'is trivialised' 16 Mar 05 | Health British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Department of Health guidance on Cosmetic Surgery British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons to tackle cancer by 2020 Doctor application system ditched Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' soap opera grips Paris Get slim on the office treadmill tool offers 'easy' coding Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' evidence' for Algarve arrest New doubt cast on Woolmer murder US evangelist Jerry Falwell dies New Media Home: The Conclusion the bohemian spirit live on when jazz clubs go smoke-free?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6652183.stm Fears over NHS cancer drug costs 14 May 2007, 04:08 GMT 05:08 over NHS cancer drug costs Health correspondent, BBC News Many cancer charities are concerned about the issue of drugs Cancer doctors have told the BBC they fear the NHS will not be able to afford the new generation of cancer drugs. Specialists are already arguing that patients may have to pay for more drugs themselves, with the issue becoming pressing as new drugs are developed. But some patients offering to pay for a cancer drug are being told they would have to meet all their care costs. It is due to different interpretations of contracts and policies designed to separate private from NHS-funded care. The issue is becoming more critical as the number of new cancer drugs being developed grows. In all, 180 specialist cancer doctors told the BBC they were worried or very worried about the situation, in response to a questionnaire submitted by the BBC. The drugs in the pipeline are going to cause even more pressure Cancer tsar calls for reform Around half the drugs submitted to the English NHS advisory body NICE are for the treatment of cancer. Some, like Herceptin for breast cancer, have won NICE backing as being cost effective for the health service. Others like Tarceva, which can extend the life of lung cancer patients, have been turned down. Specialists like Nick James, professor of clinical oncology in Birmingham, believe the gap between what the NHS can fund and what is available is going to get bigger. "The drugs in the pipeline are going to cause even more pressure. I think politicians need to be honest and say this gap is going to be there and we need to look at ways of filling it," he said. He believes it is inevitable that patients will make a bigger contribution themselves, but is worried NHS policy stands in the way. Some patients who offer to pay for a cancer drug recommended by their doctor are told they will have to transfer completely to private care. This can have the effect of doubling bills which already run into many thousands. I would rather fund cancer patients' drugs than middle management who measure government targets Colin Webber, Reading, UK Send us your comments Professor James works in one of a number of trusts which interpret policy more flexibly, effectively allowing patients to pay for cancer drugs and continue to receive other NHS care. Stephen Allen is one patient to benefit from that, although that still leaves him paying £3,000 every six weeks for the drugs alone. Mr Allen is terminally ill with kidney and lung cancer and had been told he only had six months to live. Stephen Allen is paying for his own drugs NHS funding for the drug recommended for him was refused, with letters explaining the health service has limited resources and faces very tough decisions. He said: "I didn't realise we had to pay for certain drugs. If they'd said from the start there are certain drugs on the list which aren't available to you, we probably would have understood a little bit easier the situation they're in." So Mr Allen is spending savings he wanted to leave for his wife in the hope of living to see the first birthday of his youngest grandchild, two-month-old Annabelle. We need to have an honest debate about how we're going to have to fund these things In England, the official policy of the Department of Health is that allowing patients to contribute towards NHS care - known as co-payment - is against the principles and values of the NHS. The government says it could lead to a two tier system. In Scotland a different picture is emerging. Earlier this year Scotland's Chief Medical Officer issued much more nuanced advice to the health service there. He points out that if a patient opts to pay for a particular drug not available from the NHS there is no law which allows health boards to make the patient pay for all aspects of their treatment. The letter sets out a framework for drawing up ways of allowing "the safe provision of concurrent treatment where appropriate". The NHS has received a record increase in funding in recent years, but it still has to set financial priorities within those limits. A government report published by the National Cancer director for England, Professor Mike Richards, said cancer care had improved, with faster access to treatment and money spent on new equipment. Professor Richards, said demand for drugs would grow, and need had to be met on a fair basis. "We have got to look at whether we are using the current money on cancer in the NHS as effectively as we can." But he added: "There are limits to what the health service can pay." Dr Jesme Fox, medical director of the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation, said she was appalled some people spend the last few months of their life in a desperate fight for NHS funding. The average time from diagnosis to death for lung cancer patients is six months. "If they're not going to be allowed to access drugs that improve survival by a few months, or improve their quality of life, we need to have an honest debate about how we're going to have to fund these things."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6647811.stm Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' 15 May 2007, 00:05 GMT 01:05 diet 'cuts lung disease risk' The Mediterranean diet contains a lot of fruit Eating a Mediterranean diet halves the risk of serious lung disease like emphysema and bronchitis, a study says. Grouped under the umbrella term chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), they are expected to become the world's third leading cause of death by 2020. French researchers tracked almost 43,000 men for 12 years. The Thorax study suggests the diet - with much fruit, vegetables, grains and fish - is rich in anti-oxidants, which cut the risk of tissue inflammation. Alternatively, lower levels of sugar and nitrates in the diet - both of which have been linked to impaired lung function - may play a role. A more standard Western diet tends to include higher levels of processed foods, refined sugars, and cured and red meats than the Mediterranean diet. The researchers, from the French research institute Inserm, found that a Mediterranean diet was associated with a 50% lower risk of developing COPD than the Western diet - even after taking factors such as smoking and age into account. And men who ate a predominantly Western diet were more than four times as likely to develop COPD. The study showed that the higher the compliance with a Mediterranean diet, the lower the risk of developing COPD over the 12-year period. Conversely, the higher the compliance with the Western diet, the higher was the risk of developing COPD. Last month, an international study reported that a Mediterranean diet helped prevent the development of asthma and respiratory allergies in children. And last year, US researchers found that eating a Mediterranean diet could reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's. Dr Keith Prowse, chairman of the British Lung Foundation, said: "COPD is a hugely disabling illness and we welcome the findings of this large study which provide an interesting insight into a possible link between diet and the disease. "COPD is the only major cause of death whose incidence is on the increase in the UK and we urgently need more research into all aspects of the disease so that health services can prevent and treat it more effectively." diet 'could prevent asthma' 05 Apr 07 | Health Too much bacon 'bad for lungs' 17 Apr 07 | Health 14 Mar 06 | Medical notes to tackle cancer by 2020 Doctor application system ditched Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' soap opera grips Paris Get slim on the office treadmill tool offers 'easy' coding Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' evidence' for Algarve arrest New doubt cast on Woolmer murder US evangelist Jerry Falwell dies New Media Home: The Conclusion the bohemian spirit live on when jazz clubs go smoke-free?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6647137.stm Many 'ignore basic home hygiene' 14 May 2007, 16:28 GMT 17:28 'ignore basic home hygiene' Many people do not wash their hands More two thirds of people do not comply with basic hygiene principles - and men are the worst culprits, research shows. The Hygiene Council found many people fail to wash their hands after using the toilet, before preparing food or after coughing and sneezing. As a result people are more likely to encounter germs in their homes than in public places. Public toilets are often cleaner than home kitchen surfaces, according to the report. 53% don't wash their hands properly after sneezing or coughing 22% don't wash their hand properly after handling animals or pets Good hygiene is directly linked to a reduction in rates of illness and infection. The research found one in in 10 people do not wash their hands after going to the toilet. Nearly a quarter of the population will handle food after stroking their pets without using any disinfectant first. In the home the toilet is not the principle home of bacteria: there were more harmful germs on light switches, door handles and the kitchen chopping board. However, the research found that only 3% of people believe their homes are infectious and only one in three make sure their kitchen surfaces are clean. Professor John Oxford, a virologist at Queen Mary's School of Medicine and Dentistry in London and chairman of the Hygiene Council, said despite medical and scientific advances, homes were more germ-ridden today than they were before antibiotics entered widespread use in the 1940s. He said: "People born before the antibiotic era had not relaxed their guard. "I think we have relaxed our guard today, because whatever infection we have we think we can just pull something off the shelf and deal with it. That's a serious mistake. "Scientific evidence shows that simple and good hygiene practices can reduce the risk of illness and infection at home and in the community, so we must protect ourselves by putting these measures into practice." He added: "Hands are absolutely vital. I would suggest myself that we should be washing our hands six or seven times a day." Each year there are more than 70,000 known cases of food poisoning in the UK.

More than 31 million prescriptions for drugs such as Prozac were issued in 2006 - a 6% rise on the year before. The figures come as two studies showed "startling" benefits of country walks in people with depression. Mind, the charity that reported the findings, said GPs should consider "ecotherapy" as a valid alternative. The National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence issued guidance in 2004 recommending that antidepressants should not be used as first-line therapy for mild to moderate depression.

But figures from the Information Centre indicate the number of prescriptions for antidepressants are still on the rise. In particular prescriptions for a group of drugs known as SSRIs, which include Prozac, rose by 10% last year from 14.7m to 16.2m. There have been fears that the drugs are linked to suicidal thoughts and self-harm in some cases. In 2003, experts said SSRI antidepressants should not be given to teenagers after experts' concerns they made some patients suicidal. However, Prozac is still recommended for under-18s, as it is thought that the benefits of taking this particular drug outweigh any potential risk, but only for those with severe depression. Mind, the mental health charity, say the UK is trailing behind other countries in the use of other therapies. In the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Austria, Belgium and Slovenia, patients with depression are prescribed agricultural work. Holland has 600 care farms that are part of the health service compared with 43 in the UK none of which are aimed at mental health. In a report on ecotherapy, Mind said 93% of GPs have prescribed drugs due to lack of alternatives.

"The real story is the lack of access to services such as talking therapies and the long waiting lists for these. GPs find themselves in a difficult position because of limited services."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6655221.stm Alzheimer's drug's impact hailed 14 May 2007, 23:55 GMT 00:55 drug's impact hailed The drugs are reserved for those with moderate Alzheimer's Alzheimer's drugs currently being denied to some NHS patients may have a dramatic impact on the pathology of the brain, research in the UK indicates. Neurology says that post-mortem tests on 24 patients found a 70% fall of a protein linked to dementia in those who had taken cholinesterase inhibitors. Campaigners are fighting to get the drugs available on the NHS after they were rejected for use in mild cases. Experts said the study was interesting but small and inconclusive as a result. Post-mortem examinations were done on 12 patients who took part in UK trials of the drugs - donepezil, rivastigmine, tacrine and galantamine. We knew there may be some reduction in the levels of beta-amyloid among people prescribed cholinesterase drugs, but the sheer magnitude of the reduction was a real surprise Professor Clive Ballard, study leader Professor Clive Ballard, director of research at the Alzheimer's Society, and colleagues measured the concentrations of two proteins associated with the build up of plaques found in the brains with people with dementia. The results were compared with 12 patients studied before cholinesterase drugs were available. Deposits of one of the proteins - beta amyloid - in the plaques were 70% lower in the brains of people who received the drugs in the trial. There was no difference in amounts of the other protein known as tau. Professor Ballard said: "We knew there may be some reduction in the levels of beta-amyloid among people prescribed cholinesterase drugs, but the sheer magnitude of the reduction was a real surprise. "The study looked at dementia with Lewy bodies but beta-amyloid is also a hallmark in Alzheimer's disease. "The results suggest that if we want to slow down the progression of these diseases the earlier we start prescribing these treatments the better." Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 2001 recommended donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine should be used as standard. But in November the watchdog announced people with newly diagnosed, mild Alzheimer's were exempt. The Alzheimer's Society is set to go to the High Court next month as part of a judicial review of the decision. Neil Hunt, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Society, added: "People with Alzheimer's disease and their carers have known about the life-changing benefits of these drugs for some time now and this study provides the first hard evidence of the physical benefits of the same treatments." But Dr Declan McCloughlin, senior lecturer in the Medical Research Council Centre for Neurodegeneration, said there could be other explanations for the findings. "This is a very interesting but preliminary finding which could have happened by chance because the sample groups are small. "We know from clinical trials the drugs have modest benefits and so if they have an effect on the underlying molecular pathology it's not a very big effect. "But is shows there may be some improvement in one of the key pathologies of the disease." Rebecca Wood, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, said: "Although the scientists looked at Lewy Body disease rather than Alzheimer's, the two conditions have much in common and this study shows how a class of drugs, restricted by NICE for so-called performance reasons, do help to prevent the physical progression of dementia." drugs appeal refused 11 Oct 06 | Health Drug 'treats severe Alzheimer's' 23 Mar 06 | Health 'The drug improved both our lives' 10 Oct 06 | Health to tackle cancer by 2020 Doctor application system ditched Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' slim on the office treadmill Sarkozy soap opera grips Paris Free tool offers 'easy' coding Med diet 'cuts lung disease risk' evidence' for Algarve arrest New doubt cast on Woolmer murder US evangelist Jerry Falwell dies New Media Home: The Conclusion the bohemian spirit live on when jazz clubs go smoke-free?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/business/6657757.stm | Asda to cut out additives by 2008 15 May 2007, 13:00 GMT 14:00 to cut out additives by 2008 Food companies are looking closely at what they put in the meals Asda, the UK supermarket chain owned by US retailer Wal-Mart, will remove all artificial colours and flavours from its own-brand food and drinks by 2008. The news comes after a recent report advised parents not to give their children food containing certain additives because of health concerns. The move will cover 9,000 own-label food and drink products, Asda said. Asda also announced that its earnings in the first three months of 2007 had risen from the same period a year ago. The company said it was benefiting from lower prices and a broader product range. "It's not rocket science," said Andy Bond, Asda's chief executive. "There's still plenty to do, but with interest rates on the rise again people are feeling the pinch, so lowering prices is as important now as it's ever been," he added. Explaining its decision to halt the use of artificial colours and flavours, Asda said it was acting because "mums and dads are becoming more and more concerned about what's in the food they buy". Asda - which is owned by US retail giant Wal-Mart - will replace the fake flavours with natural ones where necessary, while many others will simply be removed. Earlier this month, a study said that parents should avoid giving their children foods containing a number of so-called E numbers because they could have an effect on their behaviour. A warning came after a team at the University of Southampton tested the additives tartrazine (E102), ponceau 4R (E124), sunset yellow (E110), carmoisine (E122), quinoline yellow (E104) and allura red AC (E129). The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said it would not issue formal recommendations until the findings were published. artificial food colourings' 25 May 04 | Health Artificial food colouring warning 08 May 07 | Health Wal-Mart profits up on price cuts 20 Feb 07 | Business Asda in legal bid to stop strike 23 Jun 06 | Business Asda gives young staff adult pay 04 Oct 06 | Business Asda industrial action called off 29 Jun 06 | Business Bank hears Wolfowitz case Reuters agrees to Thomson buyout Bank's overdraft charges upheld starts using animal products Sarkozy soap opera grips Paris US to ignore Russia missile fears evidence' for Algarve arrest doubt cast on Woolmer murder US evangelist Jerry Falwell dies the bohemian spirit live on when jazz clubs go smoke-free?
