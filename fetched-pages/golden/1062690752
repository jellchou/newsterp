News First of 9 Kan. tornado victims buried By ROXANA HEGEMAN, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 3:42 AM ET GREENSBURG, Kan. - The cleanup and recovery stopped briefly Thursday as the first funeral procession for one of the nine residents killed during a massive tornado made its way to a cemetery. National Guard members took off their hard hats and waited until the procession, lead with a hearse carrying Beverly Lynn Volz, passed before they resumed work. Earlier, more than 100 people attended Volz' funeral at United Methodist Church in neighboring Mullinville. The funeral had to be held there because all the churches in Greensburg were destroyed. Volz, 52, was remembered as a "wonderful lady" known for her love of cats. "What a symbol of a person who cares and reaches out to the least of our creatures and provides a home," the Rev. Larry Bassett said during the service. Bassett told mourners that it is a time of stress for everyone. "I've seen friends and neighbors and people who didn't know each other wrap their arms around each other. Isn't that what a community is all about?" he said. "It is not about buildings." The tornado destroyed more than 90 percent of the tiny south-central Kansas city, and community leaders are trying to instill hope in a grieving population that is still sifting through the remnants of their homes. Across the city, the buzz of chain saws filled the air. A plume of black smoke from burning debris piles at a landfill drifted for miles. Homeowners loaded pickup trucks and vans with salvaged furniture and other remaining possessions. Frank Banta's home was spared, but several others he owned and his shop were demolished. He said he wasn't sure what would happen to the city. "A lot of them are leaving, going to take their money and go," he said. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/marines_haditha	Marine: Haditha officials wanted probe - Yahoo! News Marine: Haditha officials wanted probe By THOMAS WATKINS, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 40 minutes ago CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. - The town council in Haditha, , complained to Marine officers about the killings of 24 civilians, but U.S. military officials rejected a call to investigate, a Marine intelligence captain testified Friday. Capt. Jeffrey Dinsmore testified that council members met with battalion commander Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani and company commander Capt. Lucas McConnell from the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines on Nov. 27, 2005, eight days after a Marine squad killed 24 Iraqis including women and children in their homes. Dinsmore said the council had circulated a flier demanding an investigation into the deaths and outlining allegations that Marines deliberately targeted civilians after a deadly roadside bombing, but he dismissed the flier as propaganda. "My assessment was the city council was being used as a tool of insurgent propaganda," Dinsmore said. "We would see allegations like that a couple of times a week." Dinsmore, who has not been charged, spoke on the fourth day of a preliminary hearing for Capt. Randy W. Stone, one of four officers, including McConnell and Chessani, charged with dereliction of duty for failing to investigate the killings. Three enlisted Marines are charged with unpremeditated murder in the biggest U.S. criminal case involving civilian deaths in the Iraq war. The attack occurred Nov. 19, 2005 after a roadside bomb struck a Humvee convoy, killing one Marine and injuring two others. In the aftermath, Marines shot five Iraqis by a car and went house to house looking for insurgents, using grenades and machine guns to clear houses. Maj. Gen. Richard A. Huck, the top general in charge of Marines in Iraq's Al Anbar province when the killings occurred, testified Thursday that he knew about the deaths the day they occurred, but considered them simply a "truly unfortunate" consequence of war at the time. "I had no information that a law of armed conflict violation had been committed," he said by video link from the Stone's attorney, Charles Gittins, called Huck to testify in an attempt to show Stone did nothing wrong because Marines throughout the command chain knew about the killings but agreed not to order an investigation because the deaths were deemed to have been lawful. Several other military officials have testified that the killings were considered an unfortunate consequence of war, and they saw no need to investigate. On Wednesday, a Marine sergeant testified that his squad leader, Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich, shot five Iraqi men as they stood with their hands in the air and then told comrades to lie about it. The hearing is part of an Article 32 investigation, the military's equivalent to a grand jury proceeding. Maj. Thomas McCann, the investigating officer, will hear evidence and recommend whether the charges should go to trial.

News 1 teen killed in Chicago bus shooting Fri May 11, 12:10 AM ET CHICAGO - A gunman boarded a Chicago Transit Authority bus on the city's South Side on Thursday afternoon and opened fire, killing one teenager and wounding four others, authorities said. The suspect fired multiple shots and then exited the bus and ran, said Assistant Deputy Superintendent Eugene Williams. He did not comment about a motive for the shooting and asked the public to call in with tips. The victims were all taken to area hospitals. Blair Holt, 16, died at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, said hospital spokeswoman Deb Song. Two teenage girls remained in fair condition at Advocate Christ, Song said. A 16-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy were in fair condition at Little Company of Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park, Mirabelli said. The shooting took place around 3:15 p.m., said CTA spokeswoman Wanda Taylor. The driver quickly pulled the bus over to a spot she believed was safe, said CTA spokeswoman Sheila Gregory.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/suspicious_devices	Men apologize for Boston cartoon stunt - Yahoo! News Men apologize for Boston cartoon stunt By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 57 minutes ago BOSTON - Prosecutors said they would not pursue charges against two men who planted electronic devices around the city as part of a botched advertising campaign after the pair apologized Friday for causing a bomb scare. Peter Berdovsky, 27, and Sean Stevens, 28, also performed community service at a rehabilitation center in a deal with prosecutors. In contrast to their first court appearance in January, when they mugged for the camera and waved to friends in the courtroom, the men offered contrite apologies and said they never expected the stunt to cause any turmoil. "I deeply regret that this incident caused such anguish and disruption to so many people," Berdovsky told the Charlestown District Court. Stevens said he saw the devices simply as "harmless entertainment." "I had no intention of upsetting or alarming anyone," he said. The two were accused of planting about three dozen battery-powered devices in Boston and Cambridge on Jan. 31. The devices, a promotion for Cartoon Network, had lights that created images of a cartoon character making an obscene gesture. Fears of terrorism arose when the devices were discovered in a subway station and on a bridge, among other locations. Bomb squads were deployed, and highways, bridges and some transit stations were temporarily closed. Similar signs were placed in nine other cities around the United States, but only in Boston did they elicit such a response. Berdovsky and Stevens were charged with placing a hoax device and disorderly conduct. Attorney General Martha Coakley said it would have been difficult to prove to a jury that the men intended to create panic, and that she did not believe they realized the problems the ads would cause. "We believe this was an appropriate and fair resolution," Coakley said. Berdovsky said he was relieved the case was resolved without a trial. "I am looking forward to what the future has to bring. I'm just going to be working really hard and working on my art and working to build a really peaceful community for all of us to live in," Berdovsky told The Associated Press by telephone after the hearing. Berdovsky performed 80 hours of service and Stevens completed 60 hours at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Center in Boston. The men designed a cartoon mural that will be painted in a waiting area for children undergoing physical therapy, said Oz Mondejar, Spaulding's vice president of human resources.

News Fort Dix suspects all are denied bail By GEOFF MULVIHILL, Associated press Writer Fri May 11, 4:21 PM ET CAMDEN, N.J. - Six Muslim men suspected of plotting to massacre U.S. soldiers at Fort Dix were ordered held without bail Friday. Prosecutors argued that the men, all born outside the United States, pose a flight risk. They are being held at a federal detention center in Philadelphia. The men were arrested Monday during what the said was an attempt to buy AK-47 machine guns, M-16s and other weapons. They targeted Fort Dix, a post 25 miles east of Philadelphia that is used primarily to train reservists, partly because one of them had delivered pizzas there and was familiar with the base, according to court filings. Their objective was to kill "as many American soldiers as possible," the documents said. The men have lived in and around Philadelphia for years, worshipped at moderate mosques and worked blue-collar jobs installing roofs, driving a cab, delivering pizzas and baking bread. Four are ethnic Albanians from the former Yugoslavia, one is from Jordan and one is from Turkey. As they were led into the courtroom, each of the suspects smiled to relatives and friends, many of whom wept and blew kisses to them. Only one of the men, Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer, 22, asked to be released on bail, and friends and relatives offered to post properties they owned as collateral. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Stigall argued against letting Shnewer be released to the custody of his parents while awaiting trial. He said many of the illegal actions that the government alleges Shnewer committed happened or were planned at his parents' house. Defense lawyers for some of the men said they are considering attacking the prosecution's reliance on two paid informants who infiltrated the group more than a year ago and recorded conversations with the defendants. Authorities said they first learned about the men in January 2006 after a tip from a clerk at a Mount Laurel electronics store. Circuit City spokeswoman Jackie Foreman said Friday that credit for the tip is shared by two employees. She declined to name them but said the company has "communicated its appreciation." She declined to give details. The pair called police because a home video the men wanted transferred to a DVD looked like it might have terrorist links, U.S. Attorney Christopher J. Christie said. Earlier this year, authorities said, the men took a training trip to the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, where they fired weapons and played paintball to prepare for an attack. Five of the men &#151; Shnewer; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan "Anthony" or "Tony" Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir "Elvis" Duka, 23 &#151; are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons. He could face 10 years in prison if convicted. Abdullahu, who faces the least serious charges of the six, will have another bail hearing next Thursday.

News XM shock jocks apologize for sex comment 2 hours, 23 minutes ago WASHINGTON - XM Satellite Radio shock jocks Opie and Anthony apologized Friday for airing a homeless man's crude comments that he'd like to have sex with The remarks were made on their show Wednesday by a guest the duo call Homeless Charlie. As the name of each woman came up, the guest said he would like to have sex with her &#151; using language not fit for print. Opie and Anthony laughed as they imagined Rice's "horror" while describing a violent sexual encounter in which Rice is punched in the face. Washington-based XM condemned the remarks. "We deplore the comments made on Wednesday's 'Opie & Anthony Show,'" XM spokesman Nathaniel Brown told The Associated Press on Friday. He would not say whether XM planned to take disciplinary action. Opie and Anthony, whose full names are Anthony Cumia and Greg "Opie" Hughes, apologized to listeners on Friday's show. "We apologize to the public officials for comments that we made on our XM show on May 9th. We take very seriously the responsibility that comes with our creative freedom and regret any offense that this segment has caused," they said. Because the show airs on satellite radio, there are no federal restrictions on its content. According to XM's Web site, the radio service has parental controls that allow users to block access to channels that frequently contain explicit language. Those channels are designated with an "XL" notation. The same radio duo was dumped by CBS Radio in August 2002 for running a contest in which they said two listeners had sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. They were hired by XM in 2004. The remarks could become an issue as XM seeks approval from the to merge with New York-based Sirius Satellite Radio, said Tom Taylor, editor of the trade magazine Inside Radio. "XM and Sirius don't want any regulation," he said in Friday's New York Daily News. "But it's come up in four congressional hearings &#151; and at this point, the merger is such a close call, any issue could become important." The FCC did not return phone calls Friday seeking comment. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News 3 dead in crash on Chesapeake Bay bridge By BRIAN WITTE, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 9:44 AM ET ANNAPOLIS, Md. - A runaway trailer started a chain-reaction crash on the Chesapeake Bay bridge, killing three people and injuring five others as dozens of vehicles swerved to avoid it, authorities said. As crumpled trucks were hauled away Thursday evening, structural engineers examined the bridge by boat, air and foot and it was found to be structurally sound and safe, said Marcus Brown, chief of the Maryland Transportation Authority Police. Friday morning, all lanes were open again. The bridge, officially known as the William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge, is the main artery connecting Maryland's Eastern Shore with the rest of the state. With the westbound lanes closed all night, stores on the eastern side were busy. "They can't get across the bridge to go home so they're just hanging out until the bridge opens up. It's good for business, but it's not good for me here all alone," said Melodie Shreve, who was working by herself at the Shore Stop in Stevensville. The Best Western in Grasonville, a few miles from the bridge, sold out by 8 p.m. Melissa Hess, the front desk supervisor, said some guests who had suites even gave up their second room to help stranded motorists. The crash started when a small flatbed trailer being pulled by an SUV came unattached shortly after 4 p.m. at the start of the bridge's westbound span. In all, seven vehicles crashed, including a tanker hauling animal fat and a tow truck. "Other vehicles that were following swerved to avoid a trailer and that's what started this collision," said police Cpl. Jonathan Green. He described it as an "unbelievable crash scene" with vehicles pinned against each other and the railings, but said none went off the bridge. Brown said it was too early in the investigation to say whether charges would be filed. One person was flown to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center with life-threatening injuries; four others had less serious injuries, Brown said. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/missouri_flooding	More Mo. flooding; parts of river crest - Yahoo! News More Mo. flooding; parts of river crest By CHRIS BLANK, Associated Press Writer WOOLDRIDGE, Mo. - Levee breaks along the Missouri River flooded homes, farms, highways and railroad tracks as floodwaters that have inundated the region were expected to peak in some spots this weekend. Near-record flood levels dropped in some places but rose in northwest and central Missouri, as worried residents removed valuables from their homes and filled sandbags to protect river communities. A barge that floated loose in Glasgow was captured by the state water patrol about 60 road miles downstream near Hartsburg, officials said. The water patrol planned to tie it up until the waters recede, Highway Patrol Capt. Tim Hull said. Along the Mississippi River, surging water and debris threatened to knock loose a docked, four-story pleasure barge and slam it into a bridge. Three of the four chains holding it in place broke, but crews and a private tug boat company were able to secure it. Inmates from St. Joseph prison and National Guard members filled sandbags to try to protect a water treatment plant, schools and an ethanol plant near Craig, where the Missouri River dropped a few inches Thursday. The water got within "a hillbilly's whisker from going over in several places," Holt County Sheriff Kirby Felumb said. Rivers breached or topped dozens of levees across the state, officials said. No serious injuries or deaths had been reported in the flooding, said Brian Hauswirth, a spokesman for the State Emergency Management Agency. The storms that raised river levels also generated the tornadoes that killed 12 people in Kansas last weekend. Although the river crests were lower than forecast in many areas, residents remained anxious. Many were here for the 1993 floods, among the most costly in U.S. history. At the State Emergency Operations Center, Gov. Matt Blunt said damage assessment teams were being dispatched to 17 counties, and about 100 Missouri National Guard members had been deployed. He said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has prepared about 1.2 million sandbags. "We were fortunate that a majority of counties made a lot of improvements since '93," National Guard Col. Glenn Hagler said. The rain-swollen rivers and streams that make up the Missouri River system are causing damage as the water flows east toward St. Louis, where the Missouri River meets the Mississippi, said Suzanne Fortin, a meteorologist with the In Jefferson City, the Missouri River was expected to crest Sunday at 8.7 feet above flood stage, which could cause flooding at the airport and other low-lying areas below the bluff where the state Capitol sits. Officials in Chariton County, which includes Brunswick, said the Grand River was expected to crest Friday afternoon and the levees should hold. People were sandbagging some low-lying spots. Some basements had water in them, but no serious damage or injuries were reported. Also Friday, farmers in Wooldridge, a tiny town about 15 miles west of Columbia, contested plans by the Department of Conversation to let a small amount of water into a wetland habitat. Levees had cut the area off from the Missouri River, said wildlife regional supervisor Mike Schroer. But town residents objected and stopped water from entering the pipe about 15 minutes after it was opened, and the agency said it had no plans to try again. John Clay, whose farm is protected by the levee, said two area residents were standing guard to prevent state officials from reopening it. "This could not be acceptable, and there can be no good reason to do this at this point in time with the river flooding," he said. Associated Press writer Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City and Jim Salter in St. Louis, Mo., contributed to this report. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News 28 accused in marriage-citizenship scam By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 12:37 AM ET COLUMBIA, S.C. - More than two dozen men and women are accused of arranging or participating in marriages with Bulgarians to help the foreigners evade U.S. immigration laws, a federal prosecutor said Thursday. The scheme, which involved U.S. citizens being recruited and paid to marry Bulgarians, appears to have started in 1997, Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin McDonald said. He would not comment on money amounts. "The allegations are that this was a ring, a conspiracy, to engage in fraudulent marriages," he said. A federal indictment charged 13 Bulgarians and 15 U.S. citizens with conspiring to arrange or participate in the marriages. Nine were still being sought. More than a dozen also faced an additional marriage fraud charge. "They did not reside together as husband and wife, and had no intention of residing together," the indictment states. The marriages occurred in South Carolina, where the U.S. citizens were recruited, and Georgia, the indictment stated. Some of the Bulgarians were arrested in Boston, Chicago, Stamford, Conn., and Portland, Maine, McDonald said. If convicted of the conspiracy charge, each person would face up to five years in prison. Many suspects appeared in court Wednesday and were released on bail, McDonald said. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

Calif. island fire turned from town By ANDREW GLAZER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:21 PM ET AVALON, Calif. - Firefighters turned back flames that threatened Santa Catalina Island's main city and some residents planned to return to their homes Friday after thousands were forced to evacuate a day earlier. The wildfire was 4,000 acres, or more than 6 square miles, and was only 10 percent contained early Friday. But worries were eased by the day's favorable weather forecast and the arrival of dozens of fire trucks and air tankers on the narrow, mountainous island 30 miles off Los Angeles. "Everyone is working very hard to make sure that the people are safe and the animals are safe," Gov. Most of the 76-square-mile island is owned by a land conservancy, home to wildlife including the Catalina Island fox, North American bison and bald eagle. Flames that had menaced the main city of Avalon the night before were no longer visible from there on Friday. But a layer of ash and a puff of smoke that rose from a hillside overlooking the crescent harbor were reminders of a harrowing night. "The risk has been reduced significantly," Fire Chief Steven Hoefs said. "Most of the structures have been protected." The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon in the island's rugged interior, feeding on dry brush and fanned by a steady wind into the night. One home and a few small structures in the canyons outside the city burned. About 3,800 residents and tourists fled, Schwarzenegger said. As people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries to the mainland, many covered their faces with towels and bandanas to ward off ashes. Resident Kathy Troeger fled with her three children and a friend's daughter, while her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to fight the blaze. "It was like a nightmare when we left," she said after arriving at the mainland port of Long Beach. "You couldn't breathe, and ash was falling like snow." Anita Bussing, a therapist who has a second home on the island, described a sky "completely gray with orange streaks." The helicopters were flying all over the place," she said. "People were freaking out, children were crying." Island hotel worker Susana Garcia, 22, waited long into the night at the dock looking for her father. She had gone to the mainland to do errands before the fire started and was unable to reach her father, who had stayed behind. "I've been asking everybody if they've seen him, but I haven't found him yet," Garcia said. Dozens of fire engines arrived through the night from as far away as Fresno, carried by giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton. One firefighter was overcome by inhalation and was in stable condition. Wind that reached 20 mph Thursday calmed and were expected to blow the fire westward, away from Avalon and toward the island's sparsely populated center. Despite being well offshore, Catalina has been left parched by the lack of rainfall that has made the rest of Southern California particularly susceptible to wildfires like the one in Los Angeles' Griffith Park this week. Television actor Steven W. Bailey, who lives near the park, had gone to Catalina with his wife to escape the smoke and heat on Thursday. As they approached the island, he spotted the smoke of the island blaze, and when they arrived, they weren't allowed to check into their hotel. "It just descended into more and more fire, more and more smoke, more and more ash," Bailey told KABC-TV. Firefighters were still working Friday to surround what remained of the Griffith Park fire, which briefly chased people from homes and threatened the park's landmark observatory and zoo. Elsewhere around the country, firefighters battled the second Georgia wildfire to burn more than 100,000 acres as gusty wind spread the fast-moving blaze further into northern Florida and toward the tiny town of Fargo west of the Okefenokee Swamp. Officials said the wildfire, ignited Saturday by lightning, had grown so rapidly that after six days it already rivaled a fire that has scorched 116,480 acres, or 182 square miles, of southeastern Georgia forest and swampland since April 16 &#151; the state's largest wildfire on record. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. A haze was seen in Miami, more than 300 miles away. To the north, a wildfire grew to nearly 86 square miles in northeastern Minnesota and across the border into Canada, cutting power and phone lines to many resorts and lake homes. The fire, driven by high wind Thursday and fed by drought-parched forest, has already destroyed 45 structures and was threatening about 200 more. The chance of desperately needed rainfall was still days away. Associated Press writers Daisy Nguyen and Christina Almeida in Los Angeles, and Gillian Flaccus in Long Beach contributed to this report.

Add time code information to 10/22/2005 - Minor improvements: [1.1.1] Added capability for elements to appear at the to allow explicit global relationships to be expressed. The namespace for Media RSS is defined to be: "Media RSS" is a new RSS module that supplements the enclosure capabilities of RSS 2.0. RSS enclosures are already being used to syndicate audio files and images. Media RSS extends enclosures to handle other media types, such as short films or TV, as well as provide additional metadata with the media. Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of . It allows grouping of elements that are effectively the same content, yet different representations. For instance: the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3 format. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media. It contains 14 attributes, most of which are optional. should specify the direct url to the media object. If not included, a element must be specified. is the number of bytes of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the standard MIME type of the object. It is an optional attribute. is the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable). While this attribute can at times seem redundant if is supplied, it is included because it simplifies decision making on the reader side, as well as flushes out any ambiguities between MIME type and object type. It is an optional attribute. determines if this is the default object that should be used for the . There should only be one default object per . It is an optional attribute. determines if the object is a sample or the full version of the object, or even if it is a continuous stream (sample | full | nonstop). Default value is 'full'. It is an optional attribute. is the kilobits per second rate of media. It is an optional attribute. is the number of frames per second for the media object.

This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared.

This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module. A movie review with a trailer, using a Creative Commons license. My Movie Review Site Movie Title: Is this a good movie? A music video with a link to a player window, and additional metadata about the video, including expiration date. Discussions of great videos The latest video from an artist Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light Several different songs that relate to the same topic. Discussion on different songs These songs make me think about blah Same song with multiple files at different bitrates and encodings. (Bittorrent example as well) Songs galore at different bitrates Cool song by an artist Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this specification, and to all those that sent suggestions and corrections.

News Md. school evacuated over odd bottle By BEN GREENE, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 12 minutes ago TIMONIUM, Md. - A high school was evacuated Friday after firefighters found a bottle containing a suspicious liquid in a classroom, and a teacher was taken to a hospital for dizziness. A student was arrested hours later. Police aren't releasing the 18-year-old man's name until formal charges are drawn up, Baltimore County police spokesman Bill Toohey said. The bottle found in a trash can smelled like chlorine but the investigation was still continuing into whether it was intended to be an incendiary device, Toohey said. "It was a bottle that contained a toxic substance," Toohey said. Police said the affected area involved a chemistry lab, a bathroom and a hallway at Dulaney High School in a suburb of Baltimore. The ill teacher was taken to a local hospital, Sgt. John Young of the Baltimore County Police Department said. No other injuries were reported. The fire department's hazardous materials team and members of the county police bomb squad were on the scene as a precaution, Jones said. The incident was reported just before 8 a.m., Young said. The school's 1,850 students were allowed to return to the building around 11 a.m. Full Coverage: School Violence Va.

News 2 detained in Las Vegas bombing By KEN RITTER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 2:31 PM ET LAS VEGAS - Two people were being held in connection with a deadly bombing at a Las Vegas Strip parking lot, police said Friday. One man was questioned as a "person of interest" after being detained on false identification charges, and his home was searched for clues in the bombing that killed an immigrant worker at a hot dog stand on Monday, police said. The homemade bomb had been left on the victim's car at Luxor hotel-casino's parking garage and went off after he picked it up. Police said a second person also was taken into custody but released no further information. The identity of the man who was detained was not made public after he was taken into custody Thursday evening. Police searched the man's home late Thursday "looking for anything tied to the case, including components that could be used to make an explosive device or any items that could tie him or others to the Luxor homicide," Cassell said. Police would not say what led them to the man. "He was detained for questioning," Cassell said. "He will be arrested on the warrants." The development came hours after police released blurry freeze-frame images of a car and appealed for public help to find it and the person who placed the deadly bomb. Police Lt. Lewis Roberts said Thursday that police were still trying to determine a motive for the explosion that mortally wounded 24-year-old Willebaldo Dorantes Antonio. Dorantes Antonio died at a hospital about two hours later of a head injury. A woman who was with Dorantes Antonio escaped injury. Police have said Dorantes Antonio was the intended target and the bombing was not a terrorist act or a mob hit. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said the motion-activated bomb blew up with the force of a stick of dynamite. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Calif. island survives wildfire scare By GILLIAN FLACCUS, Associated Press Writer AVALON, Calif. - Water-dumping planes and helicopters helped beat back soaring flames that threatened this quaint Catalina Island town Friday, giving firefighters a victory that allowed nearly 4,000 evacuated residents to start coming home. Even though the six-square-mile blaze was only 10 percent contained, the wildfire and thick smoke was confined to the tinder-dry brush in the mountains of this narrow island 30 miles off Los Angeles. Avalon's cobblestone streets, brightly painted bungalows, landmark casino and tourist hotels were mostly spared, with only one home and several outbuildings burned. No one was seriously injured. "Thank goodness the firefighters did get here because that made the difference," said Martha Ashleigh, 61, who has lived on Catalina on and off for years. "We were watching from our balcony and we could just see truck after truck go up there. They were just fabulous." A day earlier, flames bore down from the mountains, raining ash and chaos on the crescent harbor. Evacuated residents clambered onto ferries that passed hovercrafts packed with fire trucks from the mainland. Many were workers who cook and clean for vacationers. Others were at vacation homes as the summer tourist season geared up. "It's like a war zone. The skies turned completely gray with orange streaks. The helicopters were flying all over the place," said Anita Bussing, a therapist whose other home is in Long Beach. "People were freaking out, children were crying." By Friday afternoon, one ferry full of residents was headed back to the island on from Long Beach, and a relay of water-carrying helicopters saturated a hillside at the edge of town where smoke curled into the blue sky. The step appeared intended to extinguish any lingering hot spots. The cause of the fire, which erupted Thursday afternoon in the 76-square-mile island's rugged interior, had not yet been determined. The island's relative isolation has proven a liability before. A 1915 fire that started in a hotel burned half the town's buildings. The island's romantic vibe was memorialized in the 1958 hit "26 Miles (Santa Catalina)." Before private jets and third homes became standard fare for the rich and really famous, Santa Catalina was a celebrity haunt for the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Cecil B. DeMille. About 300 movies have been shot on the island or in nearby waters, including "Mutiny on the Bounty," "Chinatown," "Jaws" and "Apollo 13." One relic of that era are the herds of bison that were brought over for filming and later released. Environmentalists said it was too early to tell how the blaze affected the island's overall ecosystem, home to rare animal and plant life, including the Catalina Island fox. But four bald eaglets that hatched earlier this year without human help were unharmed, according to Bob Rhein, a spokesman for the Catalina Island Conservancy which owns most of the island. The eagles were wiped out decades ago by chemical contamination. Just days before and about 50 miles away on the mainland, crews beat back flames in Los Angeles' major park that singed a neighborhood of multimillion-dollar homes. That was the third menacing fire in the Hollywood Hills this spring &#151; and wildfire season here isn't supposed to heat up until the fall. Around the country, firefighters battled a wildfire in Georgia and northern Florida that burned 179,940 acres &#151; or 281 square miles &#151; since a lightning strike ignited it a week ago. The fire, which started last Saturday in the middle of the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, took just six days to grow larger than a wildfire that has burned 116,480 acres of Georgia forest and swampland over more than three weeks. In Georgia, the fire posed a potential threat to the tiny city of Fargo, where 380 people live about eight miles west of the Okefenokee Swamp. No evacuations had been ordered Friday. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. A haze was seen in Miami, more than 300 miles away. To the north, a wildfire grew to nearly 86 square miles in northeastern Minnesota and across the border into Canada, cutting power and phone lines to many resorts and lake homes. The fire, driven by high wind Thursday and fed by drought-parched forest, has already destroyed 45 structures and was threatening about 200 more. The chance of desperately needed rainfall was still days away. Associated Press writers Jeff Wilson and Robert Jablon in Los Angeles, Peter Prengaman in Long Beach and Andrew Glazer in Avalon contributed to this report.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_go_ot/baby_names_katrina	Fewer new 'Katrinas' after hurricane - Yahoo! News Fewer new 'Katrinas' after hurricane By BEN EVANS, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 33 minutes ago WASHINGTON - As baby names go, Katrina isn't in vogue these days. But she hasn't disappeared either. From its peak in the 1980s &#151; when it regularly ranked among the 100 most popular names that parents chose for their daughters &#151; it had gradually slumped to 247th by 2005, even before Hurricane Katrina smashed the Gulf Coast in late summer of that year. The name's association with the catastrophe has now knocked it out of consideration for most parents, sinking its popularity to the lowest ebb since the 1950s. Only about 850 baby girls in the United States were named Katrina last year, according to new data released Friday by the , dropping it more than 100 slots on the popularity list. At a rank of 382nd, it now sits just below Brenna. Ironically, the two states that suffered most of Katrina's wrath bucked the trend, if only in small numbers. In Louisiana, the number of babies named Katrina jumped from eight in the 12 months before the storm to 15 in the 12 months after, according to state health officials. In Mississippi, seven babies were given the name from 2004 until the storm hit in August 2005, according to state data. The number climbed to 24 from September 2005 through the end of 2006. Overall, the country's most popular names list hasn't changed much since 2005. Emily and Jacob remain atop the list. Emily has been the top girls' name since 1996; Jacob for boys since 1999. The national trend surprised Cleveland Evans, a psychology professor and names expert at Bellevue University in Nebraska. But he said Katrina isn't likely to go extinct. "This is not going to be a name like Adolf that's going to disappear and be unusable ever again," he said, referring to that name's association with Adolf Hitler. Scarlett and Stephen Billis, a Los Angeles-area couple, named their daughter Katrina last May. Scarlett said the couple was reluctant to use the name less than a year after the hurricane, but her husband had always liked it as a variation of Katherine, a family name. Also, their family is Greek and the name is close to the popular Greek name Katerina. "People ask if we named her after the hurricane," Billis said. "We didn't pick it because of that and we were actually hesitant ... but we do joke that our house looks like a hurricane hit." The Social Security Administration's rankings, released each year just before Mother's Day, are based on some 4.2 million card applications from 2006.

News Security tighter for Colo. graduation Fri May 11, 1:47 PM ET BOULDER, Colo. - University of Colorado commencement ceremonies were held under increased security Friday, a day after a scare at nearby Boulder High School. About 18,000 people attended the ceremonies, in addition to about 5,000 graduates, at a stadium on the university campus, which borders the high school grounds. SWAT officers searched the high school for four hours Thursday after a cook discovered two young males dressed in camouflage before students arrived. They ran off when she yelled at them, police said. Classes resumed at the high school Friday morning, with additional police officers and the number of student entranceways cut from 10 to just two. The district said attendance was normal. Police chief Mark Beckner said authorities don't have much information to help identify the two people, but word would likely spread at the school if they were students.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/jamestown_anniversary	Va. marks Jamestown settlement - Yahoo! News Va. marks Jamestown settlement By SONJA BARISIC, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 26 minutes ago JAMESTOWN, Va. - History lovers lined up Friday to buy a postage stamp recognizing Jamestown as America's first permanent English settlement, one of several weekend events marking the site's 400th anniversary. The commemoration will also include concerts, fireworks and a Sunday appearance by More than 100 white tents and several stages were set up around the Jamestown venues, giving them the feel of a county fair. Cultural anthropologist Judith Scott, who's been collecting stamps since was 8, waited more than an hour to buy the new Jamestown issue. The 41-cent stamp's triangular shape represents the settlers' original three-sided fort and their three ships. With her purchases tucked inside a commemorative tote bag, she and her husband, Carl, were ready to start hitting the concert stages and exhibition tents. "We don't to miss a thing," said Scott, a Venezuela native who lives in Oakton. Activities were taking place at Historic Jamestowne, where archaeologists in the mid-1990s found the remains of the settlers' fort, which had long been thought to have been washed away in the James River; the Jamestown Settlement museum, which has replicas of the fort, the settlers' three ships and an Indian village; and at the new Anniversary Park, across from Jamestown Settlement. Virginia has been throwing major Jamestown bashes every 50 years, but they have been careful to call this year's event a "commemoration," rather than a celebration. With the arrival of the English in May 1607, native Indian tribes eventually were pushed off their lands, and slavery in America is traced to Jamestown, where the first Africans in the country arrived in 1619. This year's anniversary of the colony, which was founded as a business venture, is the first to focus on all three of those cultures. The 1957 anniversary was a largely white affair. Blacks were involved in the 1907 anniversary exposition, held an hour away in Norfolk, which included a visit by black educator and leader Booker T. Washington on "Negro Day." "In 2007, it's our year to get it right, to make sure everyone is at the table," Gov. Timothy M. Kaine said. More than half of the weekend's 90,000 tickets remained unsold as of last week. Amateur historian James Pegram of Hernando, Fla., said he planned to attend all three days. "I love this place and I think everyone in America should be here at least once," Pegram said. On Friday, Kaine was expected to join former Supreme Court Justice , honorary chair of Jamestown 2007, and other dignitaries at the rededication of Historic Jamestowne. He was expected to help officially ring in the weekend with a ceremony at Anniversary Park later Friday. On Saturday, a replica of the small work boat that colonist John Smith used to explore the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries in the early 17th Century will set sail to retrace Smith's voyage. Other highlights include a joint performance by the Virginia Symphony and Richmond Symphony orchestras to premiere works written for the commemoration and a concert headlined by Bruce Hornsby, the Williamsburg-based pianist and songwriter. Bush will participate in ceremonies on Sunday, and the weekend will conclude with the performance of a 400-piece orchestra and a 1,607-voice choir. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/virginia_tech_graduation	Va. Tech graduations honor slain victims - Yahoo! News Va. Tech graduations honor slain victims By KRISTEN GELINEAU, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 9 minutes ago BLACKSBURG, Va. - Thousands of Virginia Tech graduates struggled to balance joy with grief as commencement ceremonies got under way Friday, less than a month after a student gunman's rampage devastated the campus. In an address to about 600 of the nearly 1,200 graduate students who received master's degrees, President Charles Steger spoke to the community's grief while encouraging the graduates to be proud of their accomplishments and hopeful for their futures. "Our hearts are saddened and our minds are troubled," Steger said. A larger ceremony for some 3,600 graduating seniors was set for Friday evening, where the school planned to issue class rings to relatives of the 26 slain students, followed by diplomas in smaller ceremonies Saturday. "Short was their stay on this mortal stage. Great was their impact," Steger said of the slain students. Gunman Seung-Hui Cho also killed five faculty members and himself. His family will not receive a ring or diploma. During the graduate ceremonies, nine slain graduate students were awarded posthumous master's degrees or doctorates. Faculty members hugged the relatives who received them, some wiping away tears and all drawing long and loud applause from the crowd of several thousand. Graduate Scott Cassell, 55, of Roanoke, hadn't planned to attend the commencement ceremonies. But after the attacks, the father of five decided he would go as a show of support for the grieving families. "I just can't fathom the loss," said Cassell, who received a master's degree in information technology. Security employees checked the bags of guests, armed police officers patrolled the grounds and state troopers stood guard at every entrance. Guests did not have to pass through metal detectors, though, and school officials said the level of security was comparable to what they would see at a home football game. James Long, whose sister, Michelle, earned a degree in history, said students would not let the tragedy overshadow their celebration. "There are too many people here to celebrate five, six years of hard work to let one guy screw that up," said Long, 25, of Richmond. Some families couldn't bear to attend graduation. Others said they had no choice but to come. "We have to. This is right for us," said Peter Read, whose freshman daughter Mary Karen Read was among those killed. Peter and Cathy Read returned to campus for more than their daughter's degree. They also returned to erase an unsettling image from the minds of their two youngest sons, Patrick, 4, and Brendan, 2. "They're a little concerned that the bad man's going to shoot them," Cathy Read said. "We can't let that idea grow in their heads." issued a statement praising "the compassion and resilient spirit" of the Virginia Tech community and the 3,600 graduating seniors and others earning advanced or associate degrees. "Laura and I salute the Virginia Tech Class of 2007. We also remember the students and teachers whose lives were taken last month," he said. "They will always hold a special place in the hearts of this graduating class and an entire nation." Twins Andrea and Michelle Falletti of Chantilly, Va., said the shootings will not be what they remember when they look back on four years of college. Rather, they will recall spring breaks, camping trips and partying with friends. "Obviously, what has happened has affected everything in our lives, and it will affect graduation," said Andrea Falletti, 21. "In a way, it's not going to be celebrating us as much; it's more about what we've done as a community. But that's OK. I'm proud of what we've done here."

News Murder verdict upheld despite DNA trick Thu May 10, 11:51 PM ET OLYMPIA, Wash. - Police didn't violate any privacy laws when they posed as lawyers to get a man's DNA sample from an envelope he licked, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday, upholding the man's murder conviction. John Athan was sentenced to at least 10 years in prison for the 2004 Seattle killing of a 13-year-old girl in 1982, when Athan was 14. Police suspected him at the time but lacked the evidence to arrest him, and the case went unsolved for two decades. In 2003, police sent Athan a letter on the stationery of a fictitious law firm, asking if they could represent him in a class-action lawsuit. Athan, of Palisades Park, N.J., licked the envelope and returned it, providing the DNA sample investigators needed to link him to semen found on the girl's body. He appealed his conviction, arguing that the ruse violated his privacy rights. The court's 6-3 ruling found no privacy interest in the saliva used to seal a person's mail. But even though posing as a lawyer is a misdemeanor under state law, the trick "was not so outrageous or shocking as to warrant dismissing the case," Justice Charles Johnson wrote for the majority. The Washington State Bar Association had argued that letting police pose as lawyers was unnecessary and could chill relationships between attorneys and clients, and dissenting justices agreed. Dissenters and one member of the majority also worried that the ruling did not give strong enough privacy protections to a person's DNA. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Man guilty in Chicago restaurant murders By KAREN HAWKINS, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 11:26 PM ET CHICAGO - A man was found guilty Thursday in the execution-style murders of seven people at a Chicago restaurant 14 years ago in what authorities say was a robbery that netted less than $2,000. Jurors deliberated for about eight hours before delivering the verdict against Juan Luna on all seven counts of first-degree murder. The same jurors will reconvene on Monday for the death penalty phase of case. "Today the agonizing wait is over," said Wisconsin state Rep. Jennifer Shilling, whose parents owned the Brown's Chicken and Pasta in Palatine and were among those killed. "We as family can finally exhale from this long and emotional nightmare." Victims' families began sobbing in the minutes before the verdict was read and their crying intensified when it was finally announced in court. Another man, Luna's high school friend James Degorski, has pleaded not guilty to the murders and will be tried separately. The evidence against Luna included DNA recovered from a chicken dinner the night of the slayings and a videotaped confession from the 33-year-old appliance installer. Defense attorneys attacked the reliability of that evidence during the trial and again at closing arguments, saying the DNA might not be Luna's and that, even if it was, it doesn't prove he committed the crime. Luna was 18 when prosecutors said he and Degorski walked into the restaurant on Jan. 8, 1993, at closing time and carried out the killings. The bodies of the restaurant owners Richard and Lynn Ehlenfeldt and five employees were found in a walk-in cooler and freezer. Luna was arrested nearly five years ago and is now a married father of a young son. Jurors had grisly evidence to review, including horrific crime scene photos and chilling descriptions of how the victims were systematically executed. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Engineer guilty in military secrets case By GILLIAN FLACCUS, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 7:24 AM ET SANTA ANA, Calif. - After a six-week trial, a federal jury convicted a Chinese-born engineer of conspiring to export U.S. defense technology to China, including data on an electronic propulsion system that could make submarines virtually undetectable. Friends and colleagues knew Chi Mak as an unassuming, brilliant man who worked 12-hour days as an engineer for a defense contractor, rarely went out and scrimped to pay off his 700-square-foot suburban home. Federal prosecutors portrayed Mak as a polished agent for the Chinese who used his low-key lifestyle and good reputation as a cover for his real work &#151; conspiring to pass U.S. secrets for more than two decades. The jury sided with the government, also finding Mak guilty of acting as an unregistered foreign agent, attempting to violate export control laws and making false statements to the Prosecutors had dropped a charge of the actual export of defense articles. Mak stared straight ahead and seemed to hold back tears as the verdict was read. One of his attorneys gently rubbed his back. Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Staples said Mak faces up to 45 years in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 10. "We were confident from the start and we're very happy with the verdict," Staples said. The government accused Mak, a naturalized U.S. citizen, of taking thousands of pages of documents from his defense contractor employer, Power Paragon of Anaheim, and giving them to his brother, who passed them along to Chinese authorities over a number of years. Mak was arrested in 2005 in Los Angeles after FBI agents stopped his brother and sister-in-law as they boarded a flight to Hong Kong. Investigators said they found three encrypted CDs in their luggage that contained documents on a submarine propulsion system, a solid-state power switch for ships and a Power Point presentation on the future of power electronics. Mak acknowledged during the trial that he copied classified documents from his employer and kept copies in his office. He maintained he didn't realize that making the copies was illegal. Chi Mak's wife, brother and other relatives also have been indicted and go on trial together on June 5. Staples said the government may use the verdict to try to negotiate plea bargains with Mak's indicted family members, who pleaded not guilty. Defense attorneys Marilyn Bednarski and Ronald Kaye said they would appeal the verdict, insisting the government had manipulated the facts. In many instances, the government was allowed to present classified information to U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney in his chambers, and the defense team was not allowed to view the government's application for a warrant to bug Mak's house and car, Kaye said. "It is so absurd to believe that he has been passing technology for 20 years when they had not one witness and not one piece of paper to corroborate this," Kaye said. The trial featured testimony from FBI agents, officials, encryption and espionage experts and the engineer himself. Key to the trial was the government's allegation that Mak confessed to the conspiracy &#151; and even named his so-called "handler" and specific restricted documents &#151; during an untaped jailhouse interview two days after his arrest. Mak testified he never confessed during that interview, but admitted on cross-examination that he lied repeatedly in an earlier taped interview about the number of times he had visited China and when he told authorities he didn't have friends or relatives there. He said he felt intimidated during the interrogation. "This is why I lied," he said. "They were pushing me that night." Mak's attorneys focused on a paper he had written on the propulsion system that was found in his brother's luggage at Los Angeles International Airport. Mak said he believed he was doing nothing wrong by giving the paper to his brother to take out of the country because he had written it for Power Paragon and had presented it at an engineering conference in 2004. The government, however, alleged the documents were export-controlled and couldn't fall into foreigners' hands.

News Police: S.C. family held in squalor By SEANNA ADCOX, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 44 minutes ago CHESTER, S.C. - For nearly four years, a South Carolina man held his wife and two sons captive in a house infested with maggots and human waste, authorities said. The boys slept on a bare mattress as their mother was kept in a drug-induced stupor in a house that was decrepit except for a tidy one-room illegal gambling parlor run by Danny William Dove, police said. Police found maggots infesting the refrigerator. Human waste and used toilet paper littered the bathroom floor and the house smelled like a dead animal, according to police photographs and authorities who visited the home after Dove was arrested this week. The living room was covered in trash and upturned furniture, the kitchen's cabinets were falling apart and dirty clothing was piled in waist-high heaps. "There was chaos everywhere," Chester County Sheriff's Detective Scott Thompson said Thursday. "I don't think we'll ever really determine how it happened &#151; how you get to live like that. I think he got so wrapped up in drugs and wanting to control everything, nothing else mattered." The young boys, ages 4 and 8, didn't go to school. Police say they rarely were allowed out of the house and that a video camera monitored their room and the doors to the home. The boys' own grandmother says they're hard to understand unless they're cursing. Dove, 45, plied his wife, Tamara, with prescription painkillers, cocaine and crack, and forbade her to go outside, police said. Thompson said he didn't expect the 37-year-old mother would be lucid enough to be interviewed for weeks. "People don't understand why she just doesn't leave," Thompson said. "But with a little intimidation and a lot of drug use, this is what they grew to know as normal life." Dove was charged with two counts of distribution of a controlled substance, two counts of criminal conspiracy, operating a gambling establishment and two counts of child neglect. He remained in jail Thursday without bond. If convicted, he faces up to 40 years in prison. But Dove's mother said her son held no one hostage and that his wife was the root of the couple's drug addiction. "She's driven my son crazy," Helaine Young said in an interview at her home. Young said she threw up when she visited the home with police, her first visit since Christmas 2005, when she said she left after being threatened by her daughter-in-law. Young said her son was once a wealthy owner of several convenience stores, paying for anything his wife requested including baby sitters and house cleaners. Her son installed the cameras for the family's security when he renovated the home in a rural town near the North Carolina line, she said. The pair met about 13 years ago, Young said. Young, who has taken care of the couple's 12-year-old son since he was an infant, said she's asked the Department of Social Services repeatedly over the last six years to investigate. "We have had reports in the past, and the nature of the reports are currently under review," agency spokeswoman Marilyn Matheus said. "It's too early to tell what exactly happened when." Dove's oldest child, 20-year-old Brittney Dove, said she and a friend used to take care of the boys when she stayed in the home. But she last saw them about three years ago, she said. "She would not get out of the bed," Brittney said of the boys' mother. "It disgusts me that he's in jail. I'm not condoning what he did. There's no excuse for the child neglect. But she should be there, too. He honestly loved her. He was nothing but good to her." Thompson said the boys were socially inept. "The oldest one can communicate, but it's on a 3- to 4-year-old, broken-English level," he said. "The 4-year-old jibber jabbers. It's rambling stuff." Young said the two knew how to curse because that's what they heard at home. "The cuss words were the plainest words you can hear from them," she said, recalling phone conversations with the boys. The boys are living safely with a relative, Thompson said. "Maybe now we've given these kids the chance of a normal life," Thompson said. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Men apologize for Boston cartoon stunt By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:28 PM ET BOSTON - Prosecutors said they would not pursue charges against two men who planted electronic devices around the city as part of a botched advertising campaign after the pair apologized Friday for causing a bomb scare. Peter Berdovsky, 27, and Sean Stevens, 28, also performed community service at a rehabilitation center in a deal with prosecutors. In contrast to their first court appearance in January, when they mugged for the camera and waved to friends in the courtroom, the men offered contrite apologies and said they never expected the stunt to cause any turmoil. "I deeply regret that this incident caused such anguish and disruption to so many people," Berdovsky told the Charlestown District Court. Stevens said he saw the devices simply as "harmless entertainment." "I had no intention of upsetting or alarming anyone," he said. The two were accused of planting about three dozen battery-powered devices in Boston and Cambridge on Jan. 31. The devices, a promotion for Cartoon Network, had lights that created images of a cartoon character making an obscene gesture. Fears of terrorism arose when the devices were discovered in a subway station and on a bridge, among other locations. Bomb squads were deployed, and highways, bridges and some transit stations were temporarily closed. Similar signs were placed in nine other cities around the United States, but only in Boston did they elicit such a response. Berdovsky and Stevens were charged with placing a hoax device and disorderly conduct. Attorney General Martha Coakley said it would have been difficult to prove to a jury that the men intended to create panic, and that she did not believe they realized the problems the ads would cause. "We believe this was an appropriate and fair resolution," Coakley said. Berdovsky said he was relieved the case was resolved without a trial. "I am looking forward to what the future has to bring. I'm just going to be working really hard and working on my art and working to build a really peaceful community for all of us to live in," Berdovsky told The Associated Press by telephone after the hearing. Berdovsky performed 80 hours of service and Stevens completed 60 hours at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Center in Boston. The men designed a cartoon mural that will be painted in a waiting area for children undergoing physical therapy, said Oz Mondejar, Spaulding's vice president of human resources. They also helped patients use computers, cleaned the hospital's sailing docks and helped produce a DVD featuring patients talking about their rehabilitation successes. Turner Broadcasting and the advertising agency that carried out the campaign, Interference Inc., agreed to pay a $2 million settlement to cover costs and restitution for the law enforcement response. The head of the Cartoon Network resigned nine days after the stunt. Full Coverage: Media Issues Coulter cleared in Florida vote probe AP via Yahoo! News, May 11 Calif.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/fort_dix_plot	Fort Dix suspects all are denied bail - Yahoo! News Fort Dix suspects all are denied bail By GEOFF MULVIHILL, Associated press Writer Fri May 11, 4:21 PM ET CAMDEN, N.J. - Six Muslim men suspected of plotting to massacre U.S. soldiers at Fort Dix were ordered held without bail Friday. Prosecutors argued that the men, all born outside the United States, pose a flight risk. They are being held at a federal detention center in Philadelphia. The men were arrested Monday during what the said was an attempt to buy AK-47 machine guns, M-16s and other weapons. They targeted Fort Dix, a post 25 miles east of Philadelphia that is used primarily to train reservists, partly because one of them had delivered pizzas there and was familiar with the base, according to court filings. Their objective was to kill "as many American soldiers as possible," the documents said. The men have lived in and around Philadelphia for years, worshipped at moderate mosques and worked blue-collar jobs installing roofs, driving a cab, delivering pizzas and baking bread. Four are ethnic Albanians from the former Yugoslavia, one is from Jordan and one is from Turkey. As they were led into the courtroom, each of the suspects smiled to relatives and friends, many of whom wept and blew kisses to them. Only one of the men, Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer, 22, asked to be released on bail, and friends and relatives offered to post properties they owned as collateral. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Stigall argued against letting Shnewer be released to the custody of his parents while awaiting trial. He said many of the illegal actions that the government alleges Shnewer committed happened or were planned at his parents' house. Defense lawyers for some of the men said they are considering attacking the prosecution's reliance on two paid informants who infiltrated the group more than a year ago and recorded conversations with the defendants. Authorities said they first learned about the men in January 2006 after a tip from a clerk at a Mount Laurel electronics store. Circuit City spokeswoman Jackie Foreman said Friday that credit for the tip is shared by two employees. She declined to name them but said the company has "communicated its appreciation." She declined to give details. The pair called police because a home video the men wanted transferred to a DVD looked like it might have terrorist links, U.S. Attorney Christopher J. Christie said. Earlier this year, authorities said, the men took a training trip to the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, where they fired weapons and played paintball to prepare for an attack. Five of the men &#151; Shnewer; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan "Anthony" or "Tony" Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir "Elvis" Duka, 23 &#151; are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons. He could face 10 years in prison if convicted. Abdullahu, who faces the least serious charges of the six, will have another bail hearing next Thursday.

News XM shock jocks apologize for sex comment 2 hours, 27 minutes ago WASHINGTON - XM Satellite Radio shock jocks Opie and Anthony apologized Friday for airing a homeless man's crude comments that he'd like to have sex with The remarks were made on their show Wednesday by a guest the duo call Homeless Charlie. As the name of each woman came up, the guest said he would like to have sex with her &#151; using language not fit for print. Opie and Anthony laughed as they imagined Rice's "horror" while describing a violent sexual encounter in which Rice is punched in the face. Washington-based XM condemned the remarks. "We deplore the comments made on Wednesday's 'Opie & Anthony Show,'" XM spokesman Nathaniel Brown told The Associated Press on Friday. He would not say whether XM planned to take disciplinary action. Opie and Anthony, whose full names are Anthony Cumia and Greg "Opie" Hughes, apologized to listeners on Friday's show. "We apologize to the public officials for comments that we made on our XM show on May 9th. We take very seriously the responsibility that comes with our creative freedom and regret any offense that this segment has caused," they said. Because the show airs on satellite radio, there are no federal restrictions on its content. According to XM's Web site, the radio service has parental controls that allow users to block access to channels that frequently contain explicit language. Those channels are designated with an "XL" notation. The same radio duo was dumped by CBS Radio in August 2002 for running a contest in which they said two listeners had sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. They were hired by XM in 2004. The remarks could become an issue as XM seeks approval from the to merge with New York-based Sirius Satellite Radio, said Tom Taylor, editor of the trade magazine Inside Radio. "XM and Sirius don't want any regulation," he said in Friday's New York Daily News. "But it's come up in four congressional hearings &#151; and at this point, the merger is such a close call, any issue could become important." The FCC did not return phone calls Friday seeking comment. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News 3 dead in crash on Chesapeake Bay bridge By BRIAN WITTE, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 9:44 AM ET ANNAPOLIS, Md. - A runaway trailer started a chain-reaction crash on the Chesapeake Bay bridge, killing three people and injuring five others as dozens of vehicles swerved to avoid it, authorities said. As crumpled trucks were hauled away Thursday evening, structural engineers examined the bridge by boat, air and foot and it was found to be structurally sound and safe, said Marcus Brown, chief of the Maryland Transportation Authority Police. Friday morning, all lanes were open again. The bridge, officially known as the William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge, is the main artery connecting Maryland's Eastern Shore with the rest of the state. With the westbound lanes closed all night, stores on the eastern side were busy. "They can't get across the bridge to go home so they're just hanging out until the bridge opens up. It's good for business, but it's not good for me here all alone," said Melodie Shreve, who was working by herself at the Shore Stop in Stevensville. The Best Western in Grasonville, a few miles from the bridge, sold out by 8 p.m. Melissa Hess, the front desk supervisor, said some guests who had suites even gave up their second room to help stranded motorists. The crash started when a small flatbed trailer being pulled by an SUV came unattached shortly after 4 p.m. at the start of the bridge's westbound span. In all, seven vehicles crashed, including a tanker hauling animal fat and a tow truck. "Other vehicles that were following swerved to avoid a trailer and that's what started this collision," said police Cpl. Jonathan Green. He described it as an "unbelievable crash scene" with vehicles pinned against each other and the railings, but said none went off the bridge. Brown said it was too early in the investigation to say whether charges would be filed. One person was flown to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center with life-threatening injuries; four others had less serious injuries, Brown said. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News More Mo. flooding; parts of river crest By CHRIS BLANK, Associated Press Writer WOOLDRIDGE, Mo. - Levee breaks along the Missouri River flooded homes, farms, highways and railroad tracks as floodwaters that have inundated the region were expected to peak in some spots this weekend. Near-record flood levels dropped in some places but rose in northwest and central Missouri, as worried residents removed valuables from their homes and filled sandbags to protect river communities. A barge that floated loose in Glasgow was captured by the state water patrol about 60 road miles downstream near Hartsburg, officials said. The water patrol planned to tie it up until the waters recede, Highway Patrol Capt. Tim Hull said. Along the Mississippi River, surging water and debris threatened to knock loose a docked, four-story pleasure barge and slam it into a bridge. Three of the four chains holding it in place broke, but crews and a private tug boat company were able to secure it. Inmates from St. Joseph prison and National Guard members filled sandbags to try to protect a water treatment plant, schools and an ethanol plant near Craig, where the Missouri River dropped a few inches Thursday. The water got within "a hillbilly's whisker from going over in several places," Holt County Sheriff Kirby Felumb said. Rivers breached or topped dozens of levees across the state, officials said. No serious injuries or deaths had been reported in the flooding, said Brian Hauswirth, a spokesman for the State Emergency Management Agency. The storms that raised river levels also generated the tornadoes that killed 12 people in Kansas last weekend. Although the river crests were lower than forecast in many areas, residents remained anxious. Many were here for the 1993 floods, among the most costly in U.S. history. At the State Emergency Operations Center, Gov. Matt Blunt said damage assessment teams were being dispatched to 17 counties, and about 100 Missouri National Guard members had been deployed. He said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has prepared about 1.2 million sandbags. "We were fortunate that a majority of counties made a lot of improvements since '93," National Guard Col. Glenn Hagler said. The rain-swollen rivers and streams that make up the Missouri River system are causing damage as the water flows east toward St. Louis, where the Missouri River meets the Mississippi, said Suzanne Fortin, a meteorologist with the In Jefferson City, the Missouri River was expected to crest Sunday at 8.7 feet above flood stage, which could cause flooding at the airport and other low-lying areas below the bluff where the state Capitol sits. Officials in Chariton County, which includes Brunswick, said the Grand River was expected to crest Friday afternoon and the levees should hold. People were sandbagging some low-lying spots. Some basements had water in them, but no serious damage or injuries were reported. Also Friday, farmers in Wooldridge, a tiny town about 15 miles west of Columbia, contested plans by the Department of Conversation to let a small amount of water into a wetland habitat. Levees had cut the area off from the Missouri River, said wildlife regional supervisor Mike Schroer. But town residents objected and stopped water from entering the pipe about 15 minutes after it was opened, and the agency said it had no plans to try again. John Clay, whose farm is protected by the levee, said two area residents were standing guard to prevent state officials from reopening it. "This could not be acceptable, and there can be no good reason to do this at this point in time with the river flooding," he said.

Calif. island fire turned from town By ANDREW GLAZER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:21 PM ET AVALON, Calif. - Firefighters turned back flames that threatened Santa Catalina Island's main city and some residents planned to return to their homes Friday after thousands were forced to evacuate a day earlier. The wildfire was 4,000 acres, or more than 6 square miles, and was only 10 percent contained early Friday. But worries were eased by the day's favorable weather forecast and the arrival of dozens of fire trucks and air tankers on the narrow, mountainous island 30 miles off Los Angeles. "Everyone is working very hard to make sure that the people are safe and the animals are safe," Gov. Most of the 76-square-mile island is owned by a land conservancy, home to wildlife including the Catalina Island fox, North American bison and bald eagle. Flames that had menaced the main city of Avalon the night before were no longer visible from there on Friday. But a layer of ash and a puff of smoke that rose from a hillside overlooking the crescent harbor were reminders of a harrowing night. "The risk has been reduced significantly," Fire Chief Steven Hoefs said. "Most of the structures have been protected." The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon in the island's rugged interior, feeding on dry brush and fanned by a steady wind into the night. One home and a few small structures in the canyons outside the city burned. About 3,800 residents and tourists fled, Schwarzenegger said. As people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries to the mainland, many covered their faces with towels and bandanas to ward off ashes. Resident Kathy Troeger fled with her three children and a friend's daughter, while her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to fight the blaze. "It was like a nightmare when we left," she said after arriving at the mainland port of Long Beach. "You couldn't breathe, and ash was falling like snow." Anita Bussing, a therapist who has a second home on the island, described a sky "completely gray with orange streaks." The helicopters were flying all over the place," she said. "People were freaking out, children were crying." Island hotel worker Susana Garcia, 22, waited long into the night at the dock looking for her father. She had gone to the mainland to do errands before the fire started and was unable to reach her father, who had stayed behind. "I've been asking everybody if they've seen him, but I haven't found him yet," Garcia said. Dozens of fire engines arrived through the night from as far away as Fresno, carried by giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton. One firefighter was overcome by inhalation and was in stable condition. Wind that reached 20 mph Thursday calmed and were expected to blow the fire westward, away from Avalon and toward the island's sparsely populated center. Despite being well offshore, Catalina has been left parched by the lack of rainfall that has made the rest of Southern California particularly susceptible to wildfires like the one in Los Angeles' Griffith Park this week. Television actor Steven W. Bailey, who lives near the park, had gone to Catalina with his wife to escape the smoke and heat on Thursday. As they approached the island, he spotted the smoke of the island blaze, and when they arrived, they weren't allowed to check into their hotel. "It just descended into more and more fire, more and more smoke, more and more ash," Bailey told KABC-TV. Firefighters were still working Friday to surround what remained of the Griffith Park fire, which briefly chased people from homes and threatened the park's landmark observatory and zoo. Elsewhere around the country, firefighters battled the second Georgia wildfire to burn more than 100,000 acres as gusty wind spread the fast-moving blaze further into northern Florida and toward the tiny town of Fargo west of the Okefenokee Swamp. Officials said the wildfire, ignited Saturday by lightning, had grown so rapidly that after six days it already rivaled a fire that has scorched 116,480 acres, or 182 square miles, of southeastern Georgia forest and swampland since April 16 &#151; the state's largest wildfire on record. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. A haze was seen in Miami, more than 300 miles away. To the north, a wildfire grew to nearly 86 square miles in northeastern Minnesota and across the border into Canada, cutting power and phone lines to many resorts and lake homes. The fire, driven by high wind Thursday and fed by drought-parched forest, has already destroyed 45 structures and was threatening about 200 more. The chance of desperately needed rainfall was still days away. Associated Press writers Daisy Nguyen and Christina Almeida in Los Angeles, and Gillian Flaccus in Long Beach contributed to this report.

Modified to have a attribute for better module consistency. to allow specifying categorization scheme. for a human readable label. element for media binary hashing. to distinguish formatting of text. Improved descriptions of various elements and attributes. 08/22/2005 - Improved global syndication capabilities: [1.1.0] attributes to media:text and media:content. to give more flexibility to represent things other than people or companies. to explicitly determine what type of media is expressed.

Add time code information to 10/22/2005 - Minor improvements: [1.1.1] Added capability for elements to appear at the to allow explicit global relationships to be expressed. The namespace for Media RSS is defined to be: "Media RSS" is a new RSS module that supplements the enclosure capabilities of RSS 2.0. RSS enclosures are already being used to syndicate audio files and images. Media RSS extends enclosures to handle other media types, such as short films or TV, as well as provide additional metadata with the media. Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of . It allows grouping of elements that are effectively the same content, yet different representations. For instance: the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3 format. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media. It contains 14 attributes, most of which are optional. should specify the direct url to the media object. If not included, a element must be specified. is the number of bytes of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the standard MIME type of the object. It is an optional attribute. is the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable). While this attribute can at times seem redundant if is supplied, it is included because it simplifies decision making on the reader side, as well as flushes out any ambiguities between MIME type and object type. It is an optional attribute. determines if this is the default object that should be used for the . There should only be one default object per . It is an optional attribute. determines if the object is a sample or the full version of the object, or even if it is a continuous stream (sample | full | nonstop). Default value is 'full'. It is an optional attribute. is the kilobits per second rate of media. It is an optional attribute. is the number of frames per second for the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of samples per second taken to create the media object. It is expressed in thousands of samples per second (kHz). It is an optional attribute. is number of audio channels in the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of seconds the media object plays. It is an optional attribute. is the height of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the width of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared. If this element is not included, it assumes that no restrictions are necessary. It has one optional attribute. r (cz 1 lz 1 nz 1 oz 1 vz 1) is the URI that identifies the rating scheme. It is an optional attribute. If this attribute is not included, the default scheme is urn:simple (adult | nonadult). The title of the particular media object. It has 1 optional attribute.

The keywords and phrases should be comma delimited. kitty, cat, big dog, yarn, fluffy Allows particular images to be used as representative images for the media object. If multiple thumbnails are included, and time coding is not at play, it is assumed that the images are in order of importance. It has 1 required attribute and 3 optional attributes. specifies the url of the thumbnail. It is a required attribute. specifies the height of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the width of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the time offset in relation to the media object. Typically this is used when creating multiple keyframes within a single video. The format for this attribute should be in the DSM-CC's Normal Play Time (NTP) as used in RTSP [ RFC 2326 3.6 Normal Play Time ]. It is an optional attribute. NTP has a second or subsecond resolution. It is specified as H:M:S.h (npt-hhmmss) or S.h (npt-sec), where H=hours, M=minutes, S=second and h=fractions of a second. A possible alternative to NTP would be SMPTE. It is believed that NTP is simpler and easier to use.

It has 2 optional attributes. role specifies the role the entity played. Must be lowercase. It is an optional attribute. is the URI that identifies the role scheme. It is an optional attribute. If this attribute is not included, the default scheme is 'urn:ebu'.

It has 1 optional attribute. is the url for a terms of use page or additional copyright information. If the media is operating under a Creative Commons license, the Creative Commons module should be used instead. It is an optional attribute. Allows the inclusion of a text transcript, closed captioning, or lyrics of the media content. Many of these elements are permitted to provide a time series of text. In such cases, it is encouraged, but not required, that the elements be grouped by language and appear in time sequence order based on the time. Elements can have overlapping times. It has 4 optional attributes. Oh, say, can you see By the dawn's early light specifies the type of text embedded. Possible values are either 'plain' or 'html'. Default value is 'plain'. All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module. A movie review with a trailer, using a Creative Commons license. My Movie Review Site Movie Title: Is this a good movie? A music video with a link to a player window, and additional metadata about the video, including expiration date.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/journalists_subpoenas	Fla. judge tosses reporter subpoenas - Yahoo! News Fla. judge tosses reporter subpoenas By CURT ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 2:14 PM ET MIAMI - A judge on Friday rejected a request from a death row inmate's attorneys to force testimony and get notes from four journalists who covered a botched execution late last year. Circuit Judge Carven Angel ruled that the attorneys for death row inmate Ian Deco Lightbourne must first seek information from some of the 19 other people who witnessed the execution of Angel Diaz, whose death took 34 minutes &#151; twice as long as normal. Lightbourne's attorneys are challenging the state's use of lethal injection as unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment. They subpoenaed the four reporters, including one from The Associated Press, to appear at hearings later this month. The reporters' news organizations asked the judge to block the subpoenas, arguing that Florida law provides a "qualified privilege" protecting journalists from disclosing newsgathering information unless it cannot be obtained another way and is of "compelling interest." "The judge followed the law," said Alison Steele, attorney for the St. Petersburg Times. "Out of this great number of people, I'm sure the defendant's lawyers will find someone who can talk." Attorneys for Lightbourne had subpoenaed Ron Word, the AP's correspondent in Jacksonville, who has covered about 50 executions. Other subpoenas were issued for Chris Tisch of the St. Petersburg Times; Phil Long of The Miami Herald; and Nathan Crabbe of The Gainesville Sun. It remains possible that Lightbourne's lawyers could subpoena the reporters again if they cannot get the necessary testimony from others about the Dec. 13 execution. Diaz's slower than normal death and need for a rare second dose of chemicals led to an investigation and a temporary suspension of executions in Florida. State officials said this week that executions are likely to resume at the end of the month. Lightbourne, 47, was sentenced to death for the 1981 murder of Nancy O'Farrell after breaking into her Marion County home. He has twice been scheduled for execution but won stays to consider his appeals, including one pending before the Florida Supreme Court.

News Md. school evacuated over odd bottle By BEN GREENE, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 16 minutes ago TIMONIUM, Md. - A high school was evacuated Friday after firefighters found a bottle containing a suspicious liquid in a classroom, and a teacher was taken to a hospital for dizziness. A student was arrested hours later. Police aren't releasing the 18-year-old man's name until formal charges are drawn up, Baltimore County police spokesman Bill Toohey said. The bottle found in a trash can smelled like chlorine but the investigation was still continuing into whether it was intended to be an incendiary device, Toohey said. "It was a bottle that contained a toxic substance," Toohey said. Police said the affected area involved a chemistry lab, a bathroom and a hallway at Dulaney High School in a suburb of Baltimore. The ill teacher was taken to a local hospital, Sgt. John Young of the Baltimore County Police Department said. No other injuries were reported. The fire department's hazardous materials team and members of the county police bomb squad were on the scene as a precaution, Jones said. The incident was reported just before 8 a.m., Young said. The school's 1,850 students were allowed to return to the building around 11 a.m. Full Coverage: School Violence Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/cringe_readings	Diary readings: teen angst flashback - Yahoo! News Diary readings: teen angst flashback By SAMANTHA GROSS, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:18 PM ET NEW YORK - The year was 1987, the boy's name was Rob, and 13-year-old Ingrid Wiese had some pressing concerns. "He kisses weird," she wrote in her diary. "I just hope it doesn't stick and I don't end up kissing like that forever." Twenty years later, Wiese hauled the diary out of storage and read it to a bar full of strangers just for laughs. "Cringe" readings, these exercises are called, and they are growing in popularity around the country. In other cities, they have names such as "Mortified" and "Salon of Shame." Groups in New York and elsewhere convene to relive what most would rather forget: the depths of their teenage angst. Participants get up on stage with their ragged, old diaries and are instructed to read only material embarrassing enough to make them cringe. It turns out that embarrassing is also funny. When Wiese appeared at the reading, held monthly at a Brooklyn bar, the room was packed beyond capacity. The 33-year-old fundraiser may have been cringing, but her audience was cheering. "When most people hear about it they think, `Oh God, that would be just absolutely humiliating, I would never do that,'" said Blaise Kearsley, another reader. "But I think there's something so universal about your adolescent diaries and your poems and your school assignments. It's just stuff that everyone can relate to." Indeed, as readers spoke about zits and boys, sex and death, they heard plenty of knowing laughter. Perhaps only teenagers or former teenagers could follow this diary entry, written by a 14-year-old Kearsley in 1987: "When we got to the dance, Erin was depressed because she likes John and he spent the whole night dancing with Ada. But Ada was upset because at the end of the dance John frenched her. And number one: she likes him but she doesn't know if she likes him in THAT WAY. And number two: John is good friends with Dan, her ex, and she knows that Dan will have something to say to John about this." The Brooklyn event was started by a local administrative assistant, Sarah Brown, who in a momentary, drunken lapse started reading her old diaries to friends &#151; and discovered they had finally become more funny than painful. The monthly cringe reading has since landed Brown a book deal and a pilot for cable television's TLC, allowing the 29-year-old to quit her day job. Similar events are happening around the country in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Milwaukee and Seattle. "When you're a teenager, everything is the same level of intensity," Brown said. "They read about boys, or girls, or their parents, or their friends, or school, or something serious like, you know, a divorce &#151; but ... there's no change of tone." While the readers try to keep it light, plenty of the material in their diaries is dark, heart-wrenching stuff. "Why? Why do you think someone could really love you?" a now-grown Ingrid Wiese reads to the crowd. "You're fat, out of shape, covered with zits. You can just feel how your body is GOING. Your arms, your wrists, your calves. You're insecure, immature, and" &#151; she lowers her voice to a whisper &#151; "your grades reflect your intelligence." The 33-year-old Wiese says it's enough to make her wish she could somehow give that insecure girl a hug. "I just want to go back and tell that kid so many things, but mostly that `you're just all right the way you are,'" Wiese said after the reading. These days, Wiese's emotions are less heightened, and she carries herself confidently as she walks from the stage. Still, some things never change. "Of course!" she says when asked if she still obsesses over boys. "And I write all about it on my blog." Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Texas mother accused of mutilating baby By JUAN A. LOZANO, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 16 minutes ago HOUSTON - A mother who claimed the family dog tore off her baby son's genitals was arrested Friday and accused of mutilating the boy herself with a sharp instrument. Katherine Nadal, 25, was led away in handcuffs while awaiting a court hearing on custody of the 3-month-old boy, Holden Gothia. She was charged with injury to a child and held on $100,000 bail. Child-welfare authorities said she told social workers she woke up from a nap March 13 to find that her small dachshund had attacked her son. But a veterinarian and a doctor agreed the dog did not cause the injuries, because there was no blood or human tissue on the animal or in its mouth, police said. Police said in court papers that the mother had used a sharp instrument to cut off the boy's genitals. The instrument was not identified. Nadal's attorney had no comment. Nadal had a history of prescription drug abuse and tested positive for cocaine and methadone the day after Holden was mutilated, authorities said. She has been forbidden to see her son since the injuries occurred in March. "Given what we know today, we will probably work toward terminating her parental rights and reuniting the child with his father or another relative," said Harris County Child Protective Services spokeswoman Estella Olguin. The baby has years of reconstructive surgery and other operations ahead of him, said Daniel Sanders, an attorney for Camden Gothia, the baby's father. The dog has since been released by authorities and adopted. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News 2 detained in Las Vegas bombing By KEN RITTER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 2:31 PM ET LAS VEGAS - Two people were being held in connection with a deadly bombing at a Las Vegas Strip parking lot, police said Friday. One man was questioned as a "person of interest" after being detained on false identification charges, and his home was searched for clues in the bombing that killed an immigrant worker at a hot dog stand on Monday, police said. The homemade bomb had been left on the victim's car at Luxor hotel-casino's parking garage and went off after he picked it up. Police said a second person also was taken into custody but released no further information. The identity of the man who was detained was not made public after he was taken into custody Thursday evening. Police searched the man's home late Thursday "looking for anything tied to the case, including components that could be used to make an explosive device or any items that could tie him or others to the Luxor homicide," Cassell said. Police would not say what led them to the man. "He was detained for questioning," Cassell said. "He will be arrested on the warrants." The development came hours after police released blurry freeze-frame images of a car and appealed for public help to find it and the person who placed the deadly bomb. Police Lt. Lewis Roberts said Thursday that police were still trying to determine a motive for the explosion that mortally wounded 24-year-old Willebaldo Dorantes Antonio. Dorantes Antonio died at a hospital about two hours later of a head injury. A woman who was with Dorantes Antonio escaped injury. Police have said Dorantes Antonio was the intended target and the bombing was not a terrorist act or a mob hit. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said the motion-activated bomb blew up with the force of a stick of dynamite. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/maine_somalis	Somalis settle in old mill city in Maine - Yahoo! News Somalis settle in old mill city in Maine By JERRY HARKAVY, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 1:58 PM ET LEWISTON, Maine - A prank in which a middle-schooler tossed a slab of leftover Easter ham onto a table surrounded by Somalian Muslim youngsters has exposed &#151; yet again &#151; the gaping cultural divide in this struggling former mill town. Over the past six years, as many as 3,500 black refugees from the war-torn African country have settled in this nearly all-white, heavily French-Canadian and largely Roman Catholic city of 36,000, giving Lewiston the highest concentration of Somalis anywhere in America. Along Lisbon Street, the main downtown thoroughfare, the latest newcomers to a city built by waves of immigrants have created a mosque, the Red Sea restaurant and a couple of halal grocery stores as they try to adapt to their strange new world. Women in colorful head scarves or ankle-length hijabs can be seen walking together, not far from the canals, the once-bustling mills and the twin spires of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, built with millhands' dollars. But the influx of Somalis has raised tensions. In 2002, then-Mayor Larry Raymond created a furor when he issued a letter asking Lewiston's Somalis, then numbering about 1,000, to advise their countrymen not to come here because the city's resources were "maxed out." Tensions ran high again last summer when a local man rolled a pig's head into a Somali mosque during evening prayers. (Pork is considered unclean by Muslims.) The perpetrator, who said he did it as a joke, was charged with desecrating a place of worship. He committed suicide after a recent standoff with police. Then on April 11 came the ham incident. The student was suspended and the Maine attorney general looked into whether the prank represented a hate crime. Ultimately, no charges were filed. Haaruan Sheekhey, a 27-year-old Somali who moved to Lewiston from Denver two years ago, said he is ready to try his luck elsewhere. His restaurant failed after it was hit by vandals who scratched a swastika on a window, he said, and employers are reluctant to hire Somalis. "If somebody says, `I'm happy in Lewiston,' they're lying," he said. "We're having a hard time in this city. We're struggling. We're trying so hard to be part of this community, trying so hard to find a job, but nobody gives us a chance." Others, however, say that the Somalis are assimilating well and that a few incidents don't reflect the way the newcomers have been accepted. "Yes, there is some friction every once in a while, but that often gets blown out of proportion," said Pierrot Rugaba, program director for refugee and immigration services of Catholic Charities Maine. "Things have improved, but like everything else it takes time." Many Somalis have moved into the city's housing projects, while others are clustered in the downtown area in aging three- and four-story tenements formerly occupied by French-Canadian immigrants who worked at the textile mills in the city's industrial heyday in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By most accounts, language problems and a lack of job opportunities have proven to be the biggest hurdle to Lewiston's Somalis as they try to move up the economic ladder, leading many to shift their hopes and dreams to the next generation. "Their children are the only assets they have. They left everything else in Somalia," said Said Mohamud, manager of the Mogadishu Store, a grocery. Mohamud, 46, who taught chemistry at a university in the Somalian capital, has a daughter studying at Smith College who plans to go on to medical school and another child studying accounting at Barry University in Florida. His six other children also plan to go to college, he said. The Somalis began arriving in this city in the dead of winter in February 2001, beginning the ethnic transformation of a city that was 97 percent white. Lewiston's Somalis now represent close to 10 percent of the population, with an additional 30 or so arriving each month. Because of the Somalis' large families, the percentage in the schools is even higher. Lewiston's emergence as the city with the nation's largest percentage of Somalis happened largely by chance. Many had been placed in the Atlanta area, where it was assumed a warm climate and a large black population would ease their adjustment to America. But dismay at high crime, drugs and gangs prompted the community to look elsewhere, Mohamud said. The word went out that Maine was a safe place to raise a family. Immigrants had resettled in Portland, 40 miles to the south, but there was a shortage of affordable apartments there. Lewiston had more vacancies because of its population losses. "Lewiston is a small town, with no experiences of having immigrants from Africa, so it was a strange marriage," said Omar Jamal, executive director of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in St. Paul, Minn. Minneapolis has the highest number of Somalis, some 20,000, he said, but Lewiston has the highest concentration. Jimmy Simones, owner of a restaurant near City Hall and grandson of Greek immigrants, said incidents like the pig's head and the ham should not overshadow the way the city has welcomed its latest arrivals from abroad. Overall, he said, the Somalis are winning acceptance. "All newcomers run into these bumps in the road. This is nothing different," he said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/aircraft_crash	2 dead in Ohio aircraft collision - Yahoo! News 2 dead in Ohio aircraft collision 2 hours, 1 minute ago SHARONVILLE, Ohio - Two small aircraft collided Friday over suburban Cincinnati, raining debris onto roads and backyards and killing two people on board, authorities said. The accident evidently involved two planes, the said in a recorded message. The agency initially said one of the aircraft might have been a helicopter. Witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the types of aircraft involved. The FAA had no information about the aircrafts' flight plans or why they were so close together. Blue Ash Airport, a runway used by small planes, is several miles away. No injuries were reported on the ground. Several roads were closed because of the debris. The planes' pilots were not required to file flight plans and apparently were not in contact with air traffic controllers, the FAA said. Resident Joe Muenks said wreckage from one of the planes fell in a yard about three blocks from his house. "It took out about a third of a tree," Muenks said. "The plane nose-dived ... The metal was so crunched together we could just see there was no way anyone who was in there could have survived." What remained of the other plane landed in a street less than a mile away, blocking the two-lane road with some debris ending up in a front yard. The aircraft narrowly missed a busy interstate, coming down on either side of it. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Fewer new 'Katrinas' after hurricane By BEN EVANS, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 37 minutes ago WASHINGTON - As baby names go, Katrina isn't in vogue these days. But she hasn't disappeared either. From its peak in the 1980s &#151; when it regularly ranked among the 100 most popular names that parents chose for their daughters &#151; it had gradually slumped to 247th by 2005, even before Hurricane Katrina smashed the Gulf Coast in late summer of that year. The name's association with the catastrophe has now knocked it out of consideration for most parents, sinking its popularity to the lowest ebb since the 1950s. Only about 850 baby girls in the United States were named Katrina last year, according to new data released Friday by the , dropping it more than 100 slots on the popularity list. At a rank of 382nd, it now sits just below Brenna. Ironically, the two states that suffered most of Katrina's wrath bucked the trend, if only in small numbers. In Louisiana, the number of babies named Katrina jumped from eight in the 12 months before the storm to 15 in the 12 months after, according to state health officials. In Mississippi, seven babies were given the name from 2004 until the storm hit in August 2005, according to state data. The number climbed to 24 from September 2005 through the end of 2006. Overall, the country's most popular names list hasn't changed much since 2005. Emily and Jacob remain atop the list. Emily has been the top girls' name since 1996; Jacob for boys since 1999. The national trend surprised Cleveland Evans, a psychology professor and names expert at Bellevue University in Nebraska. But he said Katrina isn't likely to go extinct. "This is not going to be a name like Adolf that's going to disappear and be unusable ever again," he said, referring to that name's association with Adolf Hitler. Scarlett and Stephen Billis, a Los Angeles-area couple, named their daughter Katrina last May. Scarlett said the couple was reluctant to use the name less than a year after the hurricane, but her husband had always liked it as a variation of Katherine, a family name. Also, their family is Greek and the name is close to the popular Greek name Katerina. "People ask if we named her after the hurricane," Billis said. "We didn't pick it because of that and we were actually hesitant ... but we do joke that our house looks like a hurricane hit." The Social Security Administration's rankings, released each year just before Mother's Day, are based on some 4.2 million card applications from 2006. Social Security began compiling the name lists in 1997.

News Va. marks Jamestown settlement By SONJA BARISIC, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 30 minutes ago JAMESTOWN, Va. - History lovers lined up Friday to buy a postage stamp recognizing Jamestown as America's first permanent English settlement, one of several weekend events marking the site's 400th anniversary. The commemoration will also include concerts, fireworks and a Sunday appearance by More than 100 white tents and several stages were set up around the Jamestown venues, giving them the feel of a county fair. Cultural anthropologist Judith Scott, who's been collecting stamps since was 8, waited more than an hour to buy the new Jamestown issue. The 41-cent stamp's triangular shape represents the settlers' original three-sided fort and their three ships. With her purchases tucked inside a commemorative tote bag, she and her husband, Carl, were ready to start hitting the concert stages and exhibition tents. "We don't to miss a thing," said Scott, a Venezuela native who lives in Oakton. Activities were taking place at Historic Jamestowne, where archaeologists in the mid-1990s found the remains of the settlers' fort, which had long been thought to have been washed away in the James River; the Jamestown Settlement museum, which has replicas of the fort, the settlers' three ships and an Indian village; and at the new Anniversary Park, across from Jamestown Settlement. Virginia has been throwing major Jamestown bashes every 50 years, but they have been careful to call this year's event a "commemoration," rather than a celebration. With the arrival of the English in May 1607, native Indian tribes eventually were pushed off their lands, and slavery in America is traced to Jamestown, where the first Africans in the country arrived in 1619. This year's anniversary of the colony, which was founded as a business venture, is the first to focus on all three of those cultures. The 1957 anniversary was a largely white affair. Blacks were involved in the 1907 anniversary exposition, held an hour away in Norfolk, which included a visit by black educator and leader Booker T. Washington on "Negro Day." "In 2007, it's our year to get it right, to make sure everyone is at the table," Gov. Timothy M. Kaine said. More than half of the weekend's 90,000 tickets remained unsold as of last week. Amateur historian James Pegram of Hernando, Fla., said he planned to attend all three days. "I love this place and I think everyone in America should be here at least once," Pegram said. On Friday, Kaine was expected to join former Supreme Court Justice , honorary chair of Jamestown 2007, and other dignitaries at the rededication of Historic Jamestowne. He was expected to help officially ring in the weekend with a ceremony at Anniversary Park later Friday. On Saturday, a replica of the small work boat that colonist John Smith used to explore the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries in the early 17th Century will set sail to retrace Smith's voyage. Other highlights include a joint performance by the Virginia Symphony and Richmond Symphony orchestras to premiere works written for the commemoration and a concert headlined by Bruce Hornsby, the Williamsburg-based pianist and songwriter. Bush will participate in ceremonies on Sunday, and the weekend will conclude with the performance of a 400-piece orchestra and a 1,607-voice choir. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/virginia_tech_graduation	Va. Tech graduations honor slain victims - Yahoo! News Va. Tech graduations honor slain victims By KRISTEN GELINEAU, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 13 minutes ago BLACKSBURG, Va. - Thousands of Virginia Tech graduates struggled to balance joy with grief as commencement ceremonies got under way Friday, less than a month after a student gunman's rampage devastated the campus. In an address to about 600 of the nearly 1,200 graduate students who received master's degrees, President Charles Steger spoke to the community's grief while encouraging the graduates to be proud of their accomplishments and hopeful for their futures. "Our hearts are saddened and our minds are troubled," Steger said. A larger ceremony for some 3,600 graduating seniors was set for Friday evening, where the school planned to issue class rings to relatives of the 26 slain students, followed by diplomas in smaller ceremonies Saturday. "Short was their stay on this mortal stage. Great was their impact," Steger said of the slain students. Gunman Seung-Hui Cho also killed five faculty members and himself. His family will not receive a ring or diploma. During the graduate ceremonies, nine slain graduate students were awarded posthumous master's degrees or doctorates. Faculty members hugged the relatives who received them, some wiping away tears and all drawing long and loud applause from the crowd of several thousand. Graduate Scott Cassell, 55, of Roanoke, hadn't planned to attend the commencement ceremonies. But after the attacks, the father of five decided he would go as a show of support for the grieving families. "I just can't fathom the loss," said Cassell, who received a master's degree in information technology. Security employees checked the bags of guests, armed police officers patrolled the grounds and state troopers stood guard at every entrance. Guests did not have to pass through metal detectors, though, and school officials said the level of security was comparable to what they would see at a home football game. James Long, whose sister, Michelle, earned a degree in history, said students would not let the tragedy overshadow their celebration. "There are too many people here to celebrate five, six years of hard work to let one guy screw that up," said Long, 25, of Richmond. Some families couldn't bear to attend graduation. Others said they had no choice but to come. "We have to. This is right for us," said Peter Read, whose freshman daughter Mary Karen Read was among those killed. Peter and Cathy Read returned to campus for more than their daughter's degree. They also returned to erase an unsettling image from the minds of their two youngest sons, Patrick, 4, and Brendan, 2. "They're a little concerned that the bad man's going to shoot them," Cathy Read said. "We can't let that idea grow in their heads." issued a statement praising "the compassion and resilient spirit" of the Virginia Tech community and the 3,600 graduating seniors and others earning advanced or associate degrees. "Laura and I salute the Virginia Tech Class of 2007. We also remember the students and teachers whose lives were taken last month," he said. "They will always hold a special place in the hearts of this graduating class and an entire nation." Twins Andrea and Michelle Falletti of Chantilly, Va., said the shootings will not be what they remember when they look back on four years of college. Rather, they will recall spring breaks, camping trips and partying with friends. "Obviously, what has happened has affected everything in our lives, and it will affect graduation," said Andrea Falletti, 21. "In a way, it's not going to be celebrating us as much; it's more about what we've done as a community. But that's OK. I'm proud of what we've done here." Associated Press writers Sue Lindsey and Vicki Smith contributed to this report. Full Coverage: Virginia Tech Graduation Va.

News Calif. island survives wildfire scare By GILLIAN FLACCUS, Associated Press Writer AVALON, Calif. - Water-dumping planes and helicopters helped beat back soaring flames that threatened this quaint Catalina Island town Friday, giving firefighters a victory that allowed nearly 4,000 evacuated residents to start coming home. Even though the six-square-mile blaze was only 10 percent contained, the wildfire and thick smoke was confined to the tinder-dry brush in the mountains of this narrow island 30 miles off Los Angeles. Avalon's cobblestone streets, brightly painted bungalows, landmark casino and tourist hotels were mostly spared, with only one home and several outbuildings burned. No one was seriously injured. "Thank goodness the firefighters did get here because that made the difference," said Martha Ashleigh, 61, who has lived on Catalina on and off for years. "We were watching from our balcony and we could just see truck after truck go up there. They were just fabulous." A day earlier, flames bore down from the mountains, raining ash and chaos on the crescent harbor. Evacuated residents clambered onto ferries that passed hovercrafts packed with fire trucks from the mainland. Many were workers who cook and clean for vacationers. Others were at vacation homes as the summer tourist season geared up. "It's like a war zone. The skies turned completely gray with orange streaks. The helicopters were flying all over the place," said Anita Bussing, a therapist whose other home is in Long Beach. "People were freaking out, children were crying." By Friday afternoon, one ferry full of residents was headed back to the island on from Long Beach, and a relay of water-carrying helicopters saturated a hillside at the edge of town where smoke curled into the blue sky. The step appeared intended to extinguish any lingering hot spots. The cause of the fire, which erupted Thursday afternoon in the 76-square-mile island's rugged interior, had not yet been determined. The island's relative isolation has proven a liability before. A 1915 fire that started in a hotel burned half the town's buildings. The island's romantic vibe was memorialized in the 1958 hit "26 Miles (Santa Catalina)." Before private jets and third homes became standard fare for the rich and really famous, Santa Catalina was a celebrity haunt for the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Cecil B. DeMille. About 300 movies have been shot on the island or in nearby waters, including "Mutiny on the Bounty," "Chinatown," "Jaws" and "Apollo 13." One relic of that era are the herds of bison that were brought over for filming and later released. Environmentalists said it was too early to tell how the blaze affected the island's overall ecosystem, home to rare animal and plant life, including the Catalina Island fox. But four bald eaglets that hatched earlier this year without human help were unharmed, according to Bob Rhein, a spokesman for the Catalina Island Conservancy which owns most of the island. The eagles were wiped out decades ago by chemical contamination. Just days before and about 50 miles away on the mainland, crews beat back flames in Los Angeles' major park that singed a neighborhood of multimillion-dollar homes. That was the third menacing fire in the Hollywood Hills this spring &#151; and wildfire season here isn't supposed to heat up until the fall. Around the country, firefighters battled a wildfire in Georgia and northern Florida that burned 179,940 acres &#151; or 281 square miles &#151; since a lightning strike ignited it a week ago. The fire, which started last Saturday in the middle of the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, took just six days to grow larger than a wildfire that has burned 116,480 acres of Georgia forest and swampland over more than three weeks. In Georgia, the fire posed a potential threat to the tiny city of Fargo, where 380 people live about eight miles west of the Okefenokee Swamp. No evacuations had been ordered Friday. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. A haze was seen in Miami, more than 300 miles away. To the north, a wildfire grew to nearly 86 square miles in northeastern Minnesota and across the border into Canada, cutting power and phone lines to many resorts and lake homes. The fire, driven by high wind Thursday and fed by drought-parched forest, has already destroyed 45 structures and was threatening about 200 more. The chance of desperately needed rainfall was still days away. Associated Press writers Jeff Wilson and Robert Jablon in Los Angeles, Peter Prengaman in Long Beach and Andrew Glazer in Avalon contributed to this report.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/military_secrets_china	Engineer guilty in military secrets case - Yahoo! News Engineer guilty in military secrets case By GILLIAN FLACCUS, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 7:24 AM ET SANTA ANA, Calif. - After a six-week trial, a federal jury convicted a Chinese-born engineer of conspiring to export U.S. defense technology to China, including data on an electronic propulsion system that could make submarines virtually undetectable. Friends and colleagues knew Chi Mak as an unassuming, brilliant man who worked 12-hour days as an engineer for a defense contractor, rarely went out and scrimped to pay off his 700-square-foot suburban home. Federal prosecutors portrayed Mak as a polished agent for the Chinese who used his low-key lifestyle and good reputation as a cover for his real work &#151; conspiring to pass U.S. secrets for more than two decades. The jury sided with the government, also finding Mak guilty of acting as an unregistered foreign agent, attempting to violate export control laws and making false statements to the Prosecutors had dropped a charge of the actual export of defense articles. Mak stared straight ahead and seemed to hold back tears as the verdict was read. One of his attorneys gently rubbed his back. Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Staples said Mak faces up to 45 years in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 10. "We were confident from the start and we're very happy with the verdict," Staples said. The government accused Mak, a naturalized U.S. citizen, of taking thousands of pages of documents from his defense contractor employer, Power Paragon of Anaheim, and giving them to his brother, who passed them along to Chinese authorities over a number of years. Mak was arrested in 2005 in Los Angeles after FBI agents stopped his brother and sister-in-law as they boarded a flight to Hong Kong. Investigators said they found three encrypted CDs in their luggage that contained documents on a submarine propulsion system, a solid-state power switch for ships and a Power Point presentation on the future of power electronics. Mak acknowledged during the trial that he copied classified documents from his employer and kept copies in his office. He maintained he didn't realize that making the copies was illegal. Chi Mak's wife, brother and other relatives also have been indicted and go on trial together on June 5. Staples said the government may use the verdict to try to negotiate plea bargains with Mak's indicted family members, who pleaded not guilty. Defense attorneys Marilyn Bednarski and Ronald Kaye said they would appeal the verdict, insisting the government had manipulated the facts. In many instances, the government was allowed to present classified information to U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney in his chambers, and the defense team was not allowed to view the government's application for a warrant to bug Mak's house and car, Kaye said. "It is so absurd to believe that he has been passing technology for 20 years when they had not one witness and not one piece of paper to corroborate this," Kaye said. The trial featured testimony from FBI agents, officials, encryption and espionage experts and the engineer himself. Key to the trial was the government's allegation that Mak confessed to the conspiracy &#151; and even named his so-called "handler" and specific restricted documents &#151; during an untaped jailhouse interview two days after his arrest. Mak testified he never confessed during that interview, but admitted on cross-examination that he lied repeatedly in an earlier taped interview about the number of times he had visited China and when he told authorities he didn't have friends or relatives there. He said he felt intimidated during the interrogation. "This is why I lied," he said. "They were pushing me that night." Mak's attorneys focused on a paper he had written on the propulsion system that was found in his brother's luggage at Los Angeles International Airport. Mak said he believed he was doing nothing wrong by giving the paper to his brother to take out of the country because he had written it for Power Paragon and had presented it at an engineering conference in 2004. The government, however, alleged the documents were export-controlled and couldn't fall into foreigners' hands.

News Pitcher's estate sued over plane crash By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer NEW YORK - An apartment owner sued the estate of New York Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle, claiming the player's plane destroyed his home and caused him emotional injuries when it crashed into a high-rise building, killing Lidle and another man. The lawsuit filed Thursday by architect Stephane Sparta says he was at home Oct. 11 when the airplane crashed into the 30th floor of the luxury building on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The wreckage "exploded" into his 31st-floor living room, setting the contents on fire, the lawsuit says. Sparta has moved to another apartment in the building, his lawyer said. "It didn't strike him but it gave him quite a shock," lawyer David C. Cook said. "It came as close to giving him a haircut as you can get." Lidle and flight instructor Tyler Stanger had taken a midday flight past the Statue of Liberty and north up the East River but apparently had trouble as they tried to turn south. National Transportation Safety Board National Transportation Safety Board reached no final conclusions about the cause of the crash, nor whether Lidle or Stanger was piloting the plane at the time. The lawsuit is the third filed by building residents against the Lidle estate. It asks for unspecified money damages and names Lidle's wife, Melanie, as the defendant in her capacity as estate administrator. A lawyer for Melanie Lidle, Robert N. Clarke Jr., did not immediately return a call for comment. In March, Clarke said wrongful-death lawsuits for Lidle and the flight instructor were filed against Cirrus Design Corp., maker of the airplane, alleging product liability, negligence and other complaints.

News Prison for man who faked retardation Sat May 12, 12:11 AM ET TACOMA, Wash. - A Vancouver man was sentenced Friday to 13 months in prison for pretending to be mentally retarded in order to claim disability benefits. Pete J. Costello, 28, pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy to defraud the government and to fraud. He began receiving disability benefits when he was 8. He was ordered to repay the $59,226 he has received since turning 18. Costello, who cannot read or write, dictated a letter to his public defender that was submitted to the judge before sentencing and filed in court. "I know that it was wrong to 'act like a child' in the Social Security office when that is not how I really am," the letter said. "I feel very bad about this and want to do everything I can to pay this money back." Costello's mother, Rosie Costello, 46, who also pleaded guilty, is to be sentenced Thursday for coaching her son and daughter to feign mental retardation. Authorities have not found the daughter. Pete Costello continued to fake retardation into his mid-20s &#151; picking at his face, slouching and appearing uncommunicative in meetings with Social Security officials. The scheme came to light last year after he got a traffic ticket in Vancouver, then was videotaped acting normally when he contested the ticket in court. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Police: S.C. family held in squalor By SEANNA ADCOX, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:44 PM ET CHESTER, S.C. - For nearly four years, a South Carolina man held his wife and two sons captive in a house infested with maggots and human waste, authorities said. The boys slept on a bare mattress as their mother was kept in a drug-induced stupor in a house that was decrepit except for a tidy one-room illegal gambling parlor run by Danny William Dove, police said. Police found maggots infesting the refrigerator. Human waste and used toilet paper littered the bathroom floor and the house smelled like a dead animal, according to police photographs and authorities who visited the home after Dove was arrested this week. The living room was covered in trash and upturned furniture, the kitchen's cabinets were falling apart and dirty clothing was piled in waist-high heaps. "There was chaos everywhere," Chester County Sheriff's Detective Scott Thompson said Thursday. "I don't think we'll ever really determine how it happened &#151; how you get to live like that. I think he got so wrapped up in drugs and wanting to control everything, nothing else mattered." The young boys, ages 4 and 8, didn't go to school. Police say they rarely were allowed out of the house and that a video camera monitored their room and the doors to the home. The boys' own grandmother says they're hard to understand unless they're cursing. Dove, 45, plied his wife, Tamara, with prescription painkillers, cocaine and crack, and forbade her to go outside, police said. Thompson said he didn't expect the 37-year-old mother would be lucid enough to be interviewed for weeks. "People don't understand why she just doesn't leave," Thompson said. "But with a little intimidation and a lot of drug use, this is what they grew to know as normal life." Dove was charged with two counts of distribution of a controlled substance, two counts of criminal conspiracy, operating a gambling establishment and two counts of child neglect. He remained in jail Thursday without bond. If convicted, he faces up to 40 years in prison. But Dove's mother said her son held no one hostage and that his wife was the root of the couple's drug addiction. "She's driven my son crazy," Helaine Young said in an interview at her home. Young said she threw up when she visited the home with police, her first visit since Christmas 2005, when she said she left after being threatened by her daughter-in-law. Young said her son was once a wealthy owner of several convenience stores, paying for anything his wife requested including baby sitters and house cleaners. Her son installed the cameras for the family's security when he renovated the home in a rural town near the North Carolina line, she said. The pair met about 13 years ago, Young said. Young, who has taken care of the couple's 12-year-old son since he was an infant, said she's asked the Department of Social Services repeatedly over the last six years to investigate. "We have had reports in the past, and the nature of the reports are currently under review," agency spokeswoman Marilyn Matheus said. "It's too early to tell what exactly happened when." Dove's oldest child, 20-year-old Brittney Dove, said she and a friend used to take care of the boys when she stayed in the home. But she last saw them about three years ago, she said. "She would not get out of the bed," Brittney said of the boys' mother. "It disgusts me that he's in jail. I'm not condoning what he did. There's no excuse for the child neglect. But she should be there, too. He honestly loved her. He was nothing but good to her." Thompson said the boys were socially inept. "The oldest one can communicate, but it's on a 3- to 4-year-old, broken-English level," he said. "The 4-year-old jibber jabbers. It's rambling stuff." Young said the two knew how to curse because that's what they heard at home. "The cuss words were the plainest words you can hear from them," she said, recalling phone conversations with the boys. The boys are living safely with a relative, Thompson said. "Maybe now we've given these kids the chance of a normal life," Thompson said. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070512/ap_on_re_us/blue_angel_crash	Blue Angels regroup for show after crash - Yahoo! News Blue Angels regroup for show after crash By STEVE HARTSOE, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 17 minutes ago SEYMOUR JOHNSON AIR FORCE BASE, N.C. - After 21 years as a pilot, his career boasting nearly 900 aircraft carrier landings and air combat during the first , tragedy comes as no surprise to Cmdr. Kevin Mannix. That includes last month's fatal crash of a fellow Blue Angels pilot during a show in South Carolina. But for Blue Angels pilots, whose demeanor is a key part of the job, the tragedy offers another opportunity to perform the mission they were first given six decades ago: promote the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marines Corps to the world. "Our ability to bounce back and do our mission is the same as every other squadron in the U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps," said Mannix, minutes after practicing Thursday at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, where the team on Saturday was to perform its first show since the crash April 21. "The only difference is there's a lot more visibility on us because we are in the public eye," he said. "That's our job and that's what we do. I think a lot more media was focused our way on this specific mishap." Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Davis, 32, died when his No. 6 jet went down during the final minutes of a performance at the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in Beaufort, S.C. The Pittsfield, Mass., native was in his first year flying in formation with the team. An investigation into the cause of the crash, the Blue Angels' first since 1999 and the 26th fatality in the team's 60-year history, could take several months, according to the Navy. The Blue Angels typically fly their F/A-18A Hornets six days a week, but they stayed on the ground for nine days after the crash, canceling scheduled performances May 5 and May 6 at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. Saturday's show was to feature only five jets. Lt. Cmdr. Craig Olson, 37, of Kirkland, Wash., replaced Davis a couple of weeks ago. Olson, who flew with the Blue Angels from 2003-2005, will practice with the team for a few more weeks before flying in a show, Mannix said. Mannix, the team's lead pilot in the No. 1 jet, said there was anxiety among the pilots before they flew for the first time after the crash. "We lost a brother, a great friend, a great American, actually," Lt. Cmdr. John Allison, who flies the No. 5 jet, told reporters Thursday after practice. "But we're trying to move forward and think about flying, you know, think about our jobs." During practice, the team flew in its traditional delta formation, the triangle lineup they were in when Davis crashed. Olson practiced as one of two solo members, hitting mach speeds and performing head-on near misses with Allison. Each year, the Navy considers up to about 70 pilots for the squadron. The final six pilots train constantly between January and March at El Centro Naval Air Facility, Calif., and are stationed at Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida. The team is scheduled to fly 66 air shows this year at 35 locations across the country. The Blue Angels fly without the traditional G-suits, which most jet pilots wear to avoid blacking out during maneuvers that exert strong gravitational forces. The suits inflate and deflate air bladders around the lower body to keep blood in the brain and heart. The air bladders can cause a pilot to bump the control stick, so the Blue Angels learn to manage the G-forces by tensing their abdominal muscles. After a fatal crash, team members said, one of the best responses is to get back into the cockpit and grace the skies with twirls, climbs, dives and near misses at around 350 mph and only inches apart. "It feels good for the team to go back and do it," Mannix said Thursday, "including myself all the way down to the maintainers to do what we do for the American public, to get out there and show them we are resilient in what we do."

News Blue Angels regroup for show after crash By STEVE HARTSOE, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 17 minutes ago SEYMOUR JOHNSON AIR FORCE BASE, N.C. - After 21 years as a pilot, his career boasting nearly 900 aircraft carrier landings and air combat during the first , tragedy comes as no surprise to Cmdr. Kevin Mannix. That includes last month's fatal crash of a fellow Blue Angels pilot during a show in South Carolina. But for Blue Angels pilots, whose demeanor is a key part of the job, the tragedy offers another opportunity to perform the mission they were first given six decades ago: promote the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marines Corps to the world. "Our ability to bounce back and do our mission is the same as every other squadron in the U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps," said Mannix, minutes after practicing Thursday at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, where the team on Saturday was to perform its first show since the crash April 21. "The only difference is there's a lot more visibility on us because we are in the public eye," he said. "That's our job and that's what we do. I think a lot more media was focused our way on this specific mishap." Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Davis, 32, died when his No. 6 jet went down during the final minutes of a performance at the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in Beaufort, S.C. The Pittsfield, Mass., native was in his first year flying in formation with the team. An investigation into the cause of the crash, the Blue Angels' first since 1999 and the 26th fatality in the team's 60-year history, could take several months, according to the Navy. The Blue Angels typically fly their F/A-18A Hornets six days a week, but they stayed on the ground for nine days after the crash, canceling scheduled performances May 5 and May 6 at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska. Saturday's show was to feature only five jets. Lt. Cmdr. Craig Olson, 37, of Kirkland, Wash., replaced Davis a couple of weeks ago. Olson, who flew with the Blue Angels from 2003-2005, will practice with the team for a few more weeks before flying in a show, Mannix said. Mannix, the team's lead pilot in the No. 1 jet, said there was anxiety among the pilots before they flew for the first time after the crash. "We lost a brother, a great friend, a great American, actually," Lt. Cmdr. John Allison, who flies the No. 5 jet, told reporters Thursday after practice. "But we're trying to move forward and think about flying, you know, think about our jobs." During practice, the team flew in its traditional delta formation, the triangle lineup they were in when Davis crashed. Olson practiced as one of two solo members, hitting mach speeds and performing head-on near misses with Allison. Each year, the Navy considers up to about 70 pilots for the squadron. The final six pilots train constantly between January and March at El Centro Naval Air Facility, Calif., and are stationed at Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida. The team is scheduled to fly 66 air shows this year at 35 locations across the country. The Blue Angels fly without the traditional G-suits, which most jet pilots wear to avoid blacking out during maneuvers that exert strong gravitational forces. The suits inflate and deflate air bladders around the lower body to keep blood in the brain and heart. The air bladders can cause a pilot to bump the control stick, so the Blue Angels learn to manage the G-forces by tensing their abdominal muscles. After a fatal crash, team members said, one of the best responses is to get back into the cockpit and grace the skies with twirls, climbs, dives and near misses at around 350 mph and only inches apart. "It feels good for the team to go back and do it," Mannix said Thursday, "including myself all the way down to the maintainers to do what we do for the American public, to get out there and show them we are resilient in what we do."

News Men apologize for Boston cartoon stunt By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:28 PM ET BOSTON - Prosecutors said they would not pursue charges against two men who planted electronic devices around the city as part of a botched advertising campaign after the pair apologized Friday for causing a bomb scare. Peter Berdovsky, 27, and Sean Stevens, 28, also performed community service at a rehabilitation center in a deal with prosecutors. In contrast to their first court appearance in January, when they mugged for the camera and waved to friends in the courtroom, the men offered contrite apologies and said they never expected the stunt to cause any turmoil. "I deeply regret that this incident caused such anguish and disruption to so many people," Berdovsky told the Charlestown District Court. Stevens said he saw the devices simply as "harmless entertainment." "I had no intention of upsetting or alarming anyone," he said. The two were accused of planting about three dozen battery-powered devices in Boston and Cambridge on Jan. 31. The devices, a promotion for Cartoon Network, had lights that created images of a cartoon character making an obscene gesture. Fears of terrorism arose when the devices were discovered in a subway station and on a bridge, among other locations. Bomb squads were deployed, and highways, bridges and some transit stations were temporarily closed. Similar signs were placed in nine other cities around the United States, but only in Boston did they elicit such a response. Berdovsky and Stevens were charged with placing a hoax device and disorderly conduct. Attorney General Martha Coakley said it would have been difficult to prove to a jury that the men intended to create panic, and that she did not believe they realized the problems the ads would cause. "We believe this was an appropriate and fair resolution," Coakley said. Berdovsky said he was relieved the case was resolved without a trial. "I am looking forward to what the future has to bring. I'm just going to be working really hard and working on my art and working to build a really peaceful community for all of us to live in," Berdovsky told The Associated Press by telephone after the hearing. Berdovsky performed 80 hours of service and Stevens completed 60 hours at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Center in Boston. The men designed a cartoon mural that will be painted in a waiting area for children undergoing physical therapy, said Oz Mondejar, Spaulding's vice president of human resources. They also helped patients use computers, cleaned the hospital's sailing docks and helped produce a DVD featuring patients talking about their rehabilitation successes. Turner Broadcasting and the advertising agency that carried out the campaign, Interference Inc., agreed to pay a $2 million settlement to cover costs and restitution for the law enforcement response.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/cringe_readings	Diary readings: teen angst flashback - Yahoo! News Diary readings: teen angst flashback By SAMANTHA GROSS, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:18 PM ET NEW YORK - The year was 1987, the boy's name was Rob, and 13-year-old Ingrid Wiese had some pressing concerns. "He kisses weird," she wrote in her diary. "I just hope it doesn't stick and I don't end up kissing like that forever." Twenty years later, Wiese hauled the diary out of storage and read it to a bar full of strangers just for laughs. "Cringe" readings, these exercises are called, and they are growing in popularity around the country. In other cities, they have names such as "Mortified" and "Salon of Shame." Groups in New York and elsewhere convene to relive what most would rather forget: the depths of their teenage angst. Participants get up on stage with their ragged, old diaries and are instructed to read only material embarrassing enough to make them cringe. It turns out that embarrassing is also funny. When Wiese appeared at the reading, held monthly at a Brooklyn bar, the room was packed beyond capacity. The 33-year-old fundraiser may have been cringing, but her audience was cheering. "When most people hear about it they think, `Oh God, that would be just absolutely humiliating, I would never do that,'" said Blaise Kearsley, another reader. "But I think there's something so universal about your adolescent diaries and your poems and your school assignments. It's just stuff that everyone can relate to." Indeed, as readers spoke about zits and boys, sex and death, they heard plenty of knowing laughter. Perhaps only teenagers or former teenagers could follow this diary entry, written by a 14-year-old Kearsley in 1987: "When we got to the dance, Erin was depressed because she likes John and he spent the whole night dancing with Ada. But Ada was upset because at the end of the dance John frenched her. And number one: she likes him but she doesn't know if she likes him in THAT WAY. And number two: John is good friends with Dan, her ex, and she knows that Dan will have something to say to John about this." The Brooklyn event was started by a local administrative assistant, Sarah Brown, who in a momentary, drunken lapse started reading her old diaries to friends &#151; and discovered they had finally become more funny than painful. The monthly cringe reading has since landed Brown a book deal and a pilot for cable television's TLC, allowing the 29-year-old to quit her day job. Similar events are happening around the country in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Milwaukee and Seattle. "When you're a teenager, everything is the same level of intensity," Brown said. "They read about boys, or girls, or their parents, or their friends, or school, or something serious like, you know, a divorce &#151; but ... there's no change of tone." While the readers try to keep it light, plenty of the material in their diaries is dark, heart-wrenching stuff. "Why? Why do you think someone could really love you?" a now-grown Ingrid Wiese reads to the crowd. "You're fat, out of shape, covered with zits. You can just feel how your body is GOING. Your arms, your wrists, your calves. You're insecure, immature, and" &#151; she lowers her voice to a whisper &#151; "your grades reflect your intelligence." The 33-year-old Wiese says it's enough to make her wish she could somehow give that insecure girl a hug. "I just want to go back and tell that kid so many things, but mostly that `you're just all right the way you are,'" Wiese said after the reading. These days, Wiese's emotions are less heightened, and she carries herself confidently as she walks from the stage. Still, some things never change. "Of course!" she says when asked if she still obsesses over boys. "And I write all about it on my blog." Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070512/ap_on_re_us/missouri_flooding	Some fears ease in Mo. as rivers crest - Yahoo! News Some fears ease in Mo. as rivers crest By CHRIS BLANK, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 10:59 PM ET WOOLDRIDGE, Mo. - Levee breaks along the Missouri River swamped homes, farms, highways and railroad tracks as floodwaters that have inundated the region were expected to peak in some spots this weekend. It appeared many areas would fare much better than had been feared days earlier, however. Near-record flood levels dropped in some places but rose in northwest and central Missouri, as worried residents removed valuables from their homes and filled sandbags to protect river communities. A barge that floated loose in Glasgow was captured by the state water patrol about 60 road miles downstream near Hartsburg, officials said. The water patrol planned to tie it up until the waters recede, Highway Patrol Capt. Tim Hull said. Along the Mississippi River, surging water and debris threatened to knock loose a docked, four-story pleasure barge and slam it into a bridge. Three of the four chains holding it in place broke, but crews and a private tug boat company were able to secure it. Rivers breached or topped dozens of levees across the state, officials said. No serious injuries or deaths had been reported in the flooding. The storms that raised river levels also generated the tornadoes that killed 12 people in Kansas last weekend. Although the river crests were lower than forecast in many areas, residents remained anxious. Many were here for the 1993 floods, among the most costly in U.S. history. At the State Emergency Operations Center, Gov. Matt Blunt said damage assessment teams were being dispatched to 17 counties, and about 100 Missouri National Guard members had been deployed. He said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has prepared about 1.2 million sandbags. "We were fortunate that a majority of counties made a lot of improvements since '93," National Guard Col. Glenn Hagler said. The rain-swollen rivers and streams that make up the Missouri River system are causing damage as the water flows east toward St. Louis, where the Missouri River meets the Mississippi, said Suzanne Fortin, a meteorologist with the In Jefferson City, the Missouri River was expected to crest Sunday at 8.7 feet above flood stage, which could cause flooding at the airport and other low-lying areas below the bluff where the state Capitol sits. Officials in Chariton County, which includes Brunswick, said the Grand River crested Friday and the levees held. People were sandbagging some low-lying spots. Some basements had water in them, but no serious damage or injuries were reported. Farmers in Wooldridge, a tiny town about 15 miles west of Columbia, prevented the state Department of Conservation from allowing floodwaters to pour into low-lying land owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and managed by the department. Mike Schroer, the department's wildlife regional supervisor, said the agency wanted to let in only a small amount of water into a wetland habitat. Levees had cut the area off from the Missouri River, Schroer said, and water needed to preserve the wetlands can only be let in when the river is high. He estimated that 5 acres of the 4,000-acre river bottom would have been flooded. But town residents stopped water from entering the pipe about 15 minutes after it was opened. John Clay, whose farm is protected by the levee, said two area residents were standing guard to prevent state officials from reopening it. "This could not be acceptable, and there can be no good reason to do this at this point in time with the river flooding," he said. Schroer said the state was not pursuing charges against the residents but instead hoped to hold a meeting in coming weeks so all parties know what to expect when the situation arises again. "It's just a miscommunication," he said. Associated Press writers Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City and Jim Salter in St. Louis, Mo., contributed to this report.

News Some fears ease in Mo. as rivers crest By CHRIS BLANK, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 10:59 PM ET WOOLDRIDGE, Mo. - Levee breaks along the Missouri River swamped homes, farms, highways and railroad tracks as floodwaters that have inundated the region were expected to peak in some spots this weekend. It appeared many areas would fare much better than had been feared days earlier, however. Near-record flood levels dropped in some places but rose in northwest and central Missouri, as worried residents removed valuables from their homes and filled sandbags to protect river communities. A barge that floated loose in Glasgow was captured by the state water patrol about 60 road miles downstream near Hartsburg, officials said. The water patrol planned to tie it up until the waters recede, Highway Patrol Capt. Tim Hull said. Along the Mississippi River, surging water and debris threatened to knock loose a docked, four-story pleasure barge and slam it into a bridge. Three of the four chains holding it in place broke, but crews and a private tug boat company were able to secure it. Rivers breached or topped dozens of levees across the state, officials said. No serious injuries or deaths had been reported in the flooding. The storms that raised river levels also generated the tornadoes that killed 12 people in Kansas last weekend. Although the river crests were lower than forecast in many areas, residents remained anxious. Many were here for the 1993 floods, among the most costly in U.S. history. At the State Emergency Operations Center, Gov. Matt Blunt said damage assessment teams were being dispatched to 17 counties, and about 100 Missouri National Guard members had been deployed. He said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has prepared about 1.2 million sandbags. "We were fortunate that a majority of counties made a lot of improvements since '93," National Guard Col. Glenn Hagler said. The rain-swollen rivers and streams that make up the Missouri River system are causing damage as the water flows east toward St. Louis, where the Missouri River meets the Mississippi, said Suzanne Fortin, a meteorologist with the In Jefferson City, the Missouri River was expected to crest Sunday at 8.7 feet above flood stage, which could cause flooding at the airport and other low-lying areas below the bluff where the state Capitol sits. Officials in Chariton County, which includes Brunswick, said the Grand River crested Friday and the levees held. People were sandbagging some low-lying spots. Some basements had water in them, but no serious damage or injuries were reported. Farmers in Wooldridge, a tiny town about 15 miles west of Columbia, prevented the state Department of Conservation from allowing floodwaters to pour into low-lying land owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and managed by the department. Mike Schroer, the department's wildlife regional supervisor, said the agency wanted to let in only a small amount of water into a wetland habitat. Levees had cut the area off from the Missouri River, Schroer said, and water needed to preserve the wetlands can only be let in when the river is high. He estimated that 5 acres of the 4,000-acre river bottom would have been flooded. But town residents stopped water from entering the pipe about 15 minutes after it was opened. John Clay, whose farm is protected by the levee, said two area residents were standing guard to prevent state officials from reopening it. "This could not be acceptable, and there can be no good reason to do this at this point in time with the river flooding," he said. Schroer said the state was not pursuing charges against the residents but instead hoped to hold a meeting in coming weeks so all parties know what to expect when the situation arises again. "It's just a miscommunication," he said. Associated Press writers Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City and Jim Salter in St. Louis, Mo., contributed to this report.

News 3 dead in Ohio aircraft collision By LISA CORNWELL, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 9:46 PM ET SHARONVILLE, Ohio - Two small planes collided Friday afternoon over suburban Cincinnati, raining debris onto roads and backyards and killing three people on board but missing those on the ground as rush hour approached, federal investigators said. The two aircraft narrowly missed falling on a busy freeway. "I'm just thankful it wasn't worse than it was, with school buses and people coming home from work and the interstate that we have nearby," said Michael Schappa, Sharonville's police chief. had no information about the planes' flight plans or why they were so close together. Blue Ash Airport, a runway used by small planes, is several miles away. State Highway Patrol Lt. Wayne Price said investigators assume both planes took off from there. The planes' pilots were not required to file flight plans and apparently were not in contact with air traffic controllers, the FAA said. Under federal regulations, the pilots were responsible for maintaining a safe distance on a clear, sunny afternoon. Two of the victims were aboard a Cessna 172, and their identities were withheld pending notification of relatives. The pilot of the other plane, a Beechcraft Bonanza, was identified as Neils Harpsoe of suburban West Chester. No injuries were reported on the ground. Several roads and highways were temporarily closed because of the debris. A piece of a wreckage rested against a guardrail on a heavily traveled highway, where a police car with lights flashing blocked the debris for investigators as vehicles drove past. Resident Joe Muenks said wreckage from one of the planes fell in a yard about three blocks from his house. "It took out about a third of a tree," Muenks said. "The plane nose-dived ... The metal was so crunched together we could just see there was no way anyone who was in there could have survived." His son, Kevin, was playing basketball in the backyard and heard the collision. "I just heard a big pop and I looked up," Kevin Muenks said. "The plane was just coming straight down, just nose-dived into the ground. There was no explosion, fire or anything." What remained of the other plane landed in a street a few miles away, blocking the two-lane road with some debris ending up in a front yard. Based on witness accounts, the FAA initially said one of the single-engine aircraft might have been a helicopter. The agency later confirmed two planes were involved.

News Texas mother accused of mutilating baby By JUAN A. LOZANO, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 7:59 PM ET HOUSTON - A mother who claimed the family dog tore off her baby son's genitals was arrested Friday and accused of mutilating the boy herself with a sharp instrument. Katherine Nadal, 25, was led away in handcuffs while awaiting a court hearing on custody of the 3-month-old boy, Holden Gothia. She was charged with injury to a child and held on $100,000 bail. Child-welfare authorities said she told social workers she woke up from a nap March 13 to find that her small dachshund had attacked her son. But a veterinarian and a doctor agreed the dog did not cause the injuries, because there was no blood or human tissue on the animal or in its mouth, police said. Police said in court papers that the mother had used a sharp instrument to cut off the boy's genitals. The instrument was not identified. Nadal's attorney had no comment. Nadal had a history of prescription drug abuse and tested positive for cocaine and methadone the day after Holden was mutilated, authorities said. She has been forbidden to see her son since the injuries occurred in March. "Given what we know today, we will probably work toward terminating her parental rights and reuniting the child with his father or another relative," said Harris County Child Protective Services spokeswoman Estella Olguin. The baby has years of reconstructive surgery and other operations ahead of him, said Daniel Sanders, an attorney for Camden Gothia, the baby's father.

News Ex-prof gets 15 years for child porn Fri May 11, 11:40 PM ET ALEXANDRIA, Va. - A former University of Pennsylvania professor was sentenced Friday to 15 years in prison and fined $17,500 for importing child pornography. Lawrence Scott Ward, 64, of Philadelphia, was arrested Aug. 27 after returning from Brazil through Washington Dulles International Airport. Customs agents discovered child pornography on Ward's computer and found DVDs containing videos of Ward having sex acts with an underage boy, according to court documents. Ward pleaded guilty in February in U.S. District Court in Alexandria. Ward, a professor emeritus at Penn's Wharton School of Business, is retired. He had been scheduled to teach last fall before university officials relieved him of those duties after his arrest. In 1999, Ward was accused of soliciting sex from a 23-year-old undercover Pennsylvania state trooper posing as a 15-year-old boy. He was charged with attempting to promote prostitution and corrupt minors and entered an Alford plea, which means he did not admit committing the crimes but conceded prosecutors had enough evidence to convict him. He was fined $2,500 and sentenced to five years of probation. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

Calif. island fire turned from town By ANDREW GLAZER, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 4:21 PM ET AVALON, Calif. - Firefighters turned back flames that threatened Santa Catalina Island's main city and some residents planned to return to their homes Friday after thousands were forced to evacuate a day earlier. The wildfire was 4,000 acres, or more than 6 square miles, and was only 10 percent contained early Friday. But worries were eased by the day's favorable weather forecast and the arrival of dozens of fire trucks and air tankers on the narrow, mountainous island 30 miles off Los Angeles. "Everyone is working very hard to make sure that the people are safe and the animals are safe," Gov. Most of the 76-square-mile island is owned by a land conservancy, home to wildlife including the Catalina Island fox, North American bison and bald eagle. Flames that had menaced the main city of Avalon the night before were no longer visible from there on Friday. But a layer of ash and a puff of smoke that rose from a hillside overlooking the crescent harbor were reminders of a harrowing night. "The risk has been reduced significantly," Fire Chief Steven Hoefs said. "Most of the structures have been protected." The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon in the island's rugged interior, feeding on dry brush and fanned by a steady wind into the night. One home and a few small structures in the canyons outside the city burned. About 3,800 residents and tourists fled, Schwarzenegger said. As people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries to the mainland, many covered their faces with towels and bandanas to ward off ashes. Resident Kathy Troeger fled with her three children and a friend's daughter, while her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to fight the blaze. "It was like a nightmare when we left," she said after arriving at the mainland port of Long Beach. "You couldn't breathe, and ash was falling like snow." Anita Bussing, a therapist who has a second home on the island, described a sky "completely gray with orange streaks." The helicopters were flying all over the place," she said. "People were freaking out, children were crying." Island hotel worker Susana Garcia, 22, waited long into the night at the dock looking for her father. She had gone to the mainland to do errands before the fire started and was unable to reach her father, who had stayed behind. "I've been asking everybody if they've seen him, but I haven't found him yet," Garcia said. Dozens of fire engines arrived through the night from as far away as Fresno, carried by giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton. One firefighter was overcome by inhalation and was in stable condition. Wind that reached 20 mph Thursday calmed and were expected to blow the fire westward, away from Avalon and toward the island's sparsely populated center. Despite being well offshore, Catalina has been left parched by the lack of rainfall that has made the rest of Southern California particularly susceptible to wildfires like the one in Los Angeles' Griffith Park this week. Television actor Steven W. Bailey, who lives near the park, had gone to Catalina with his wife to escape the smoke and heat on Thursday. As they approached the island, he spotted the smoke of the island blaze, and when they arrived, they weren't allowed to check into their hotel. "It just descended into more and more fire, more and more smoke, more and more ash," Bailey told KABC-TV. Firefighters were still working Friday to surround what remained of the Griffith Park fire, which briefly chased people from homes and threatened the park's landmark observatory and zoo. Elsewhere around the country, firefighters battled the second Georgia wildfire to burn more than 100,000 acres as gusty wind spread the fast-moving blaze further into northern Florida and toward the tiny town of Fargo west of the Okefenokee Swamp. Officials said the wildfire, ignited Saturday by lightning, had grown so rapidly that after six days it already rivaled a fire that has scorched 116,480 acres, or 182 square miles, of southeastern Georgia forest and swampland since April 16 &#151; the state's largest wildfire on record. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. A haze was seen in Miami, more than 300 miles away. To the north, a wildfire grew to nearly 86 square miles in northeastern Minnesota and across the border into Canada, cutting power and phone lines to many resorts and lake homes. The fire, driven by high wind Thursday and fed by drought-parched forest, has already destroyed 45 structures and was threatening about 200 more. The chance of desperately needed rainfall was still days away.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070512/ap_on_re_us/fort_dix_plot	Fort Dix suspects all are denied bail - Yahoo! News Fort Dix suspects all are denied bail By GEOFF MULVIHILL, Associated press Writer Fri May 11, 10:23 PM ET CAMDEN, N.J. - Six Muslim men suspected of plotting to massacre U.S. soldiers at Fort Dix were ordered held without bail Friday. Prosecutors argued that the men, all born outside the United States, pose a flight risk. They are being held at a federal detention center in Philadelphia. The men were arrested Monday during what the said was an attempt to buy AK-47 machine guns, M-16s and other weapons. They targeted Fort Dix, a post 25 miles east of Philadelphia that is used primarily to train reservists, partly because one of them had delivered pizzas there and was familiar with the base, according to court filings. Their objective was to kill "as many American soldiers as possible," the documents said. The men have lived in and around Philadelphia for years, worshipped at moderate mosques and worked blue-collar jobs installing roofs, driving a cab, delivering pizzas and baking bread. Four are ethnic Albanians from the former Yugoslavia, one is from Jordan and one is from Turkey. As they were led into the courtroom, each of the suspects smiled to relatives and friends, many of whom wept and blew kisses to them. Only one of the men, Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer, 22, asked to be released on bail, and friends and relatives offered to post properties they owned as collateral. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Stigall argued against letting Shnewer be released to the custody of his parents while awaiting trial. He said many of the illegal actions that the government alleges Shnewer committed happened or were planned at his parents' house. Defense lawyers for some of the men said they are considering attacking the prosecution's reliance on two paid informants who infiltrated the group more than a year ago and recorded conversations with the defendants. Authorities said they first learned about the men in January 2006 after a tip from a clerk at a Mount Laurel electronics store. Circuit City spokeswoman Jackie Foreman said Friday that credit for the tip is shared by two employees. She declined to name them but said the company has "communicated its appreciation." She declined to give details. The pair called police because a home video the men wanted transferred to a DVD looked like it might have terrorist links, U.S. Attorney Christopher J. Christie said. Earlier this year, authorities said, the men took a training trip to the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, where they fired weapons and played paintball to prepare for an attack. Five of the men &#151; Shnewer; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan "Anthony" or "Tony" Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir "Elvis" Duka, 23 &#151; are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons. He could face 10 years in prison if convicted. Abdullahu, who faces the least serious charges of the six, will have another bail hearing next Thursday.

News 4 arrested in K.C. prostitution raids By ANDALE GROSS, Associated Press Writer Sat May 12, 6:19 AM ET KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Federal authorities charged four people with bringing women from China to the Kansas City area for prostitution after a series of raids at businesses billed as massage parlors. The charges were brought Friday, a day after authorities say they rescued from 15 women from 12 businesses in Johnson County, Kan., mostly at strip malls. The businesses had drawn the attention of neighbors for some time, investigators said. Those charged were Ling Xu, 45, Zhong Yan Liu, 35, Cheng Tang, 21, all Chinese citizens living in Overland Park, Kan., and Hongmei Madole, 31, a native of China married to a U.S. citizen and living in Olathe, Kan. They were charged with transporting people across state lines and national borders for the purpose of prostitution. The women are not facing charges, spokesman Jeff Lanza said. The defendants made an initial appearance Friday afternoon in U.S. District Court in Kansas City and asked the court to appoint attorneys. Bond for Madole was set at $50,000. U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Larsen set a hearing for Tuesday to determine bond for the other three defendants and to decide if the case will be sent to a grand jury. A criminal complaint filed Friday alleges that the defendants brought women across national borders and state lines, including into Kansas through Missouri, for prostitution for more than a year. U.S. Attorney John F. Wood said investigators believe the massage parlors were "in fact, nothing more than a front for highly profitable and thriving prostitution organizations." He said an 18-month investigation involving local, state and federal authorities found that the women were brought from China into the United States, primarily San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City. They then flew to Kansas City and were driven to Johnson County, Kan., Wood said. An undercover officer visited three of the businesses several times between January and May and was solicited to engage in sexual acts with women there each time, according to an affidavit filed with the criminal complaint. The affidavit says investigators also searched trash at two of the businesses and found evidence of airline flights to Kansas City from Los Angeles, Phoenix, New York City and Las Vegas. The defendants also were found to have wired a total of $83,300 to China, according to the affidavit. Calif. island survives wildfire scare Va.

News Boat to retrace voyage from Jamestown By SONJA BARISIC, Associated Press Writer Sat May 12, 3:45 AM ET JAMESTOWN, Va. - The debuts of a stamp and four orchestral pieces were bookends of the opening day of the commemoration for the 400th anniversary of the founding of America's first permanent English settlement. On Saturday, the festivities were to take to the water. A replica of the small boat that settler John Smith used to explore the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries will set sail to retrace Smith's voyage. The shallop will depart from Historic Jamestowne, the site on the James River where the colonists built a triangular fort after they arrived in May 1607. Archaeologists found the fort's remains, long thought to have been washed away, in the mid-1990s. Activities during the three-day commemoration were taking place at Historic Jamestowne as well as the nearby Jamestown Settlement museum, which has a replica of the fort, and at Anniversary Park, a former campground across from the museum. "It's a special weekend, a once-in-a-lifetime thing," said Christine White, a third-grade teacher from Williamsburg who was especially interested in Jamestown because it figures in her lesson plans on early explorers. The weekend includes musical performances, demonstrations by glassblowers and other artisans, fireworks and a Sunday appearance by On Saturday, a crew of a dozen aboard the shallop were to start a 1,500-mile trip that will inaugurate the Capt. John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail, the first all-water national historic trail established by the federal government. The nonprofit Sultana Projects Inc. of Chestertown, Md., crafted the 28-foot open boat. Smith launched his exploration in 1608, and the trip yielded a comprehensive map that guided English settlers for nearly a century. More than 100 white tents and several stages have been set up around the Jamestown venues, giving them the feel of a state fair. Kevin Brown, a Pamunkey Indian, stood on a stage in one tent Friday, carving a man's face into a dance totem made of plaster that he eventually will cast in bronze. The features on the face are a blend of his own and those of various family members. The nearly 6-foot pole rises from a three-sided base that recalls the settlers' fort. "It's a statement that the Indians have survived," Brown said. Events got under way Friday with history lovers standing in line for more than hour to buy a newly issued Jamestown postage stamp that is three-sided, like James Fort, and features a painting of the colonists' three ships. In the evening, the Virginia Symphony and Richmond Symphony orchestras combined for the first time to perform the world premiers of four pieces written for the commemoration, including a number called "Jamestown Hymn." Virginia has been recognizing major Jamestown anniversaries every 50 years, but organizers have been careful to call the 2007 event a "commemoration" instead of a celebration. With the arrival of the English, native Indian tribes eventually were pushed off their lands, and slavery in America is traced to Jamestown, where the first Africans in the country arrived in 1619.

Tech graduations honor slain victims By KRISTEN GELINEAU, Associated Press Writer BLACKSBURG, Va. - Their lives, so filled with promise, were cut short on that April day. Their families, so filled with the hope of bright futures for their loved ones, will never know what they might have accomplished. But at Friday's graduation ceremony, the 32 Virginia Tech students and faculty killed in the April 16 massacre seemed to have achieved so much, forever bonding a community and serving as a reminder that life is precious. "In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, 'They entered the stage of history just a few years ago, and in the brief years that they were privileged to act on this mortal stage, they played their parts exceedingly well,'" Virginia Tech President Charles Steger told 3,600 graduating seniors and a crowd of nearly 30,000 friends and family. They loved horseback riding and tennis. They were musicians and dancers. They were kind and compassionate, talented and unique, Steger said. They were Hokies. Those killed were remembered throughout the ceremony in emotional speeches, their faces pictured on a huge screen at Lane Stadium. Class rings were handed out to the families of many of the slain students. Diplomas were to follow in smaller ceremonies Saturday. Less than a month ago, gunman Seung-Hui Cho wrought devastation on this campus with a hail of bullets. While Steger acknowledged the emotional wounds may never heal, he urged the graduates to move forward and celebrate life. "Please know that moving on &#151; moving on is not the same as forgetting," he said. "We shall not forget. Yet, one senseless burst of violence &#151; as horrible and hurtful as it is &#151; will not turn us from our essence." As images of the slain students and faculty flashed on the stadium's screen, Steger and Provost Mark McNamee handed out the rings and received hugs in return. Cho's family will receive neither a ring nor a diploma. He killed himself as police closed in. At a ceremony Saturday morning for the engineering school, in which 11 students and three professors were slain, Dean Richard Benson was overwhelmed with emotion. "Forgive me," Benson said quietly, his voice breaking, as he paused to collect himself after speaking about Professor Kevin Granata, who was shot in a hallway as he tried to save students. Retired Army Gen. John Abizaid, former commander of U.S. forces in , praised the graduates Friday for their quiet courage, dignity and poise in dealing with the tragedy. Survivors have a responsibility to realize the dreams and aspirations of the slain, he said. "While we are saddened by the loss of those who cannot be here today, I believe that they would want this ceremony to commemorate both the tragedy of yesterday and the promise of tomorrow," he said. "I believe that they look down on this gathering with dignified pride." Students, parents and faculty rose to their feet and cheered as Abizaid thanked Steger for "holding things together" in a time of tragedy. In many ways, the evening ceremony seemed like most commencements. Grinning students jumped up and down and waved as their faces appeared on the stadium's screen while "Pomp and Circumstance" played. Students chanted "Let's go, Hokies!" and the stadium's stands twinkled with constant camera flashes from the graduates' proud family members. They decorated their mortarboards with "VT" and "Hi Mom." But the speeches, while marked by hope, were also laced with sorrow. "Rest assured, we will define ourselves by where we have been and where we will go," class historian Jennifer Weber said. Peter and Cathy Read returned to campus for the degree of their freshman daughter, Mary Karen Read, who was among those killed. They said they also returned to erase an unsettling image from the minds of their two youngest sons, Patrick, 4, and Brendan, 2. "They're a little concerned that the bad man's going to shoot them," Cathy Read said. "We can't let that idea grow in their heads." Earlier in the day, Steger and others addressed about half of the nearly 1,200 graduate students who received master's and doctorate degrees. Nine slain graduate students were awarded posthumous degrees in that ceremony. James Long, whose sister, Michelle, earned a degree in history, said students would not let the tragedy overshadow their celebration. "There are too many people here to celebrate five, six years of hard work to let one guy screw that up," he said. Associated Press writers Sue Lindsey and Vicki Smith contributed to this report.

Tech graduations honor slain victims By KRISTEN GELINEAU, Associated Press Writer BLACKSBURG, Va. - Their lives, so filled with promise, were cut short on that April day. Their families, so filled with the hope of bright futures for their loved ones, will never know what they might have accomplished. But at Friday's graduation ceremony, the 32 Virginia Tech students and faculty killed in the April 16 massacre seemed to have achieved so much, forever bonding a community and serving as a reminder that life is precious. "In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, 'They entered the stage of history just a few years ago, and in the brief years that they were privileged to act on this mortal stage, they played their parts exceedingly well,'" Virginia Tech President Charles Steger told 3,600 graduating seniors and a crowd of nearly 30,000 friends and family. They loved horseback riding and tennis. They were musicians and dancers. They were kind and compassionate, talented and unique, Steger said. They were Hokies. Those killed were remembered throughout the ceremony in emotional speeches, their faces pictured on a huge screen at Lane Stadium. Class rings were handed out to the families of many of the slain students. Diplomas were to follow in smaller ceremonies Saturday. Less than a month ago, gunman Seung-Hui Cho wrought devastation on this campus with a hail of bullets. While Steger acknowledged the emotional wounds may never heal, he urged the graduates to move forward and celebrate life. "Please know that moving on &#151; moving on is not the same as forgetting," he said. "We shall not forget. Yet, one senseless burst of violence &#151; as horrible and hurtful as it is &#151; will not turn us from our essence." As images of the slain students and faculty flashed on the stadium's screen, Steger and Provost Mark McNamee handed out the rings and received hugs in return.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070512/ap_on_re_us/congressman_bribery	New charges against former CIA official - Yahoo! News New charges against former CIA official By ALLISON HOFFMAN, Associated Press Writer Sat May 12, 1:41 AM ET SAN DIEGO - New charges have been filed alleging that a former top official pushed a proposed $100 million government contract for his best friend in return for lavish vacations, private jet flights and a lucrative job offer. The indictment, returned Thursday, replaces charges brought in February against Kyle "Dusty" Foggo, who resigned from the spy agency a year ago, and Poway-based defense contractor Brent Wilkes. The charges grew from the bribery scandal that landed former U.S. Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham in prison. The pair now face 30 wide-ranging counts of fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. According to the new indictment, Foggo provided Wilkes with "sensitive, internal information related to our national security," including classified information, to help him prepare proposals for providing undercover flights for the CIA under the guise of a civil aviation company and armored vehicles for agency operations. Then, he pushed his CIA colleagues to hire Wilkes' companies without disclosing their friendship, prosecutors allege. In a June 2005 e-mail to the head of CIA air operations quoted in the indictment, Foggo offered to "use some 'EXDIR grease'" on Wilkes' behalf. Foggo was the agency's executive director at the time. Prosecutors say that in return, Wilkes offered to hire Foggo after he retired from government service. In the meantime, they say, he treated his friend to a Scottish golf trip during which they racked up a $44,000 hotel bill at the luxurious Pitcastle Estate. The initial indictment in February charged the pair with 11 counts of the same charges in connection with a $1.7 million water-supply contract Foggo allegedly helped win for one of Wilkes' companies while he was working as a logistics coordinator at a CIA supply hub overseas. Both men have pleaded not guilty to those charges. They face arraignment on the new charges Monday. Wilkes is charged in a separate indictment with conspiracy, bribery, money laundering and unlawful monetary transactions to Cunningham in return for government contracts. That indictment also was updated this week to include new charges against another defendant, Long Island mortgage banker John T. Michael, who was described as a co-conspirator in Cunningham's 2005 plea agreement. He has pleaded not guilty to one count of obstructing justice but now faces additional counts of money laundering and unlawful monetary transactions in connection with wire transfers allegedly used to pay off the mortgage on Cunningham's $2.5 million Rancho Santa Fe mansion. Calls seeking comment from attorneys for Foggo and Wilkes were not immediately returned Friday. Michael's attorney, Howard Frank, said he had not read the indictment and had no comment. The initial charges came 20 months after the opened an investigation into Cunningham, who served on key House committees with oversight of government contracts. He pleaded guilty in November 2005 to taking $2.4 million in bribes from defense contractors and was sentenced to more than eight years in prison. Foggo and Wilkes played high school football together, and after graduating in 1972, they roomed together at San Diego State University, were best men at each other's weddings and named their sons after each other. Foggo, the former No. 3 official at the CIA, resigned from the spy agency after his house and office were raided by federal agents.

News Haditha hearing to enter 5th day By THOMAS WATKINS, Associated Press Writer Sat May 12, 3:41 AM ET CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. - For four days, Marines have testified in court that they saw no need to investigate a squad's 2005 killings of 24 civilians in the Iraqi town of Haditha. A Marine intelligence captain paid little heed to a flier from the Haditha town council that accused Marines of intentionally targeting civilians. A lieutenant dismissed a reporter's questions about alleged abuses, figuring they reflected bias against the Marines and The preliminary hearing for Capt. Randy W. Stone was to continue Saturday with testimony expected from an operations officer and a major who distributed nearly $40,000 in U.S. government compensation to survivors of the attack. Stone is one of four officers charged with dereliction of duty for failing to investigate the killings. Three enlisted Marines are charged with unpremeditated murder in the biggest U.S. criminal case involving civilian deaths in the Capt. Jeffrey Dinsmore testified Friday that council members met with battalion commander Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani and company commander Capt. Lucas McConnell from the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines on Nov. 27, 2005, eight days after a Marine squad killed 24 Iraqis including women and children in their homes after a deadly roadside bomb attack. Dinsmore said the council had circulated a flier demanding an investigation into the deaths and outlining allegations that Marines deliberately targeted civilians, but he dismissed the flier as propaganda. "The reality was then and the reality is now, you let loose Marines (in a combat environment) that are defending themselves against a hostile situation &#151; they do not have the training nor do they have presence of mind to differentiate between civilians and insurgents," Dinsmore said. The attack occurred after a roadside bomb struck a Humvee convoy, killing one Marine and injuring two others. In the aftermath, Marines shot five Iraqis by a car and went house to house looking for insurgents, using grenades and machine guns to clear houses. Dinsmore's testimony echoed other witnesses who testified that the deaths of women and children were considered collateral damage in legitimate combat. When asked how many people in his battalion knew about the civilian deaths, Dinsmore said "it was common knowledge." He testified that regimental commanders had a "unique disinterest" in investigating the killings. The hearing is part of an Article 32 investigation, the military's equivalent to a grand jury proceeding. Maj.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/maine_somalis	Somalis settle in old mill city in Maine - Yahoo! News Somalis settle in old mill city in Maine By JERRY HARKAVY, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 1:58 PM ET LEWISTON, Maine - A prank in which a middle-schooler tossed a slab of leftover Easter ham onto a table surrounded by Somalian Muslim youngsters has exposed &#151; yet again &#151; the gaping cultural divide in this struggling former mill town. Over the past six years, as many as 3,500 black refugees from the war-torn African country have settled in this nearly all-white, heavily French-Canadian and largely Roman Catholic city of 36,000, giving Lewiston the highest concentration of Somalis anywhere in America. Along Lisbon Street, the main downtown thoroughfare, the latest newcomers to a city built by waves of immigrants have created a mosque, the Red Sea restaurant and a couple of halal grocery stores as they try to adapt to their strange new world. Women in colorful head scarves or ankle-length hijabs can be seen walking together, not far from the canals, the once-bustling mills and the twin spires of the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, built with millhands' dollars. But the influx of Somalis has raised tensions. In 2002, then-Mayor Larry Raymond created a furor when he issued a letter asking Lewiston's Somalis, then numbering about 1,000, to advise their countrymen not to come here because the city's resources were "maxed out." Tensions ran high again last summer when a local man rolled a pig's head into a Somali mosque during evening prayers. (Pork is considered unclean by Muslims.) The perpetrator, who said he did it as a joke, was charged with desecrating a place of worship. He committed suicide after a recent standoff with police. Then on April 11 came the ham incident. The student was suspended and the Maine attorney general looked into whether the prank represented a hate crime. Ultimately, no charges were filed. Haaruan Sheekhey, a 27-year-old Somali who moved to Lewiston from Denver two years ago, said he is ready to try his luck elsewhere. His restaurant failed after it was hit by vandals who scratched a swastika on a window, he said, and employers are reluctant to hire Somalis. "If somebody says, `I'm happy in Lewiston,' they're lying," he said. "We're having a hard time in this city. We're struggling. We're trying so hard to be part of this community, trying so hard to find a job, but nobody gives us a chance." Others, however, say that the Somalis are assimilating well and that a few incidents don't reflect the way the newcomers have been accepted. "Yes, there is some friction every once in a while, but that often gets blown out of proportion," said Pierrot Rugaba, program director for refugee and immigration services of Catholic Charities Maine. "Things have improved, but like everything else it takes time." Many Somalis have moved into the city's housing projects, while others are clustered in the downtown area in aging three- and four-story tenements formerly occupied by French-Canadian immigrants who worked at the textile mills in the city's industrial heyday in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By most accounts, language problems and a lack of job opportunities have proven to be the biggest hurdle to Lewiston's Somalis as they try to move up the economic ladder, leading many to shift their hopes and dreams to the next generation. "Their children are the only assets they have. They left everything else in Somalia," said Said Mohamud, manager of the Mogadishu Store, a grocery. Mohamud, 46, who taught chemistry at a university in the Somalian capital, has a daughter studying at Smith College who plans to go on to medical school and another child studying accounting at Barry University in Florida. His six other children also plan to go to college, he said. The Somalis began arriving in this city in the dead of winter in February 2001, beginning the ethnic transformation of a city that was 97 percent white. Lewiston's Somalis now represent close to 10 percent of the population, with an additional 30 or so arriving each month. Because of the Somalis' large families, the percentage in the schools is even higher. Lewiston's emergence as the city with the nation's largest percentage of Somalis happened largely by chance. Many had been placed in the Atlanta area, where it was assumed a warm climate and a large black population would ease their adjustment to America. But dismay at high crime, drugs and gangs prompted the community to look elsewhere, Mohamud said. The word went out that Maine was a safe place to raise a family. Immigrants had resettled in Portland, 40 miles to the south, but there was a shortage of affordable apartments there. Lewiston had more vacancies because of its population losses. "Lewiston is a small town, with no experiences of having immigrants from Africa, so it was a strange marriage," said Omar Jamal, executive director of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in St. Paul, Minn. Minneapolis has the highest number of Somalis, some 20,000, he said, but Lewiston has the highest concentration. Jimmy Simones, owner of a restaurant near City Hall and grandson of Greek immigrants, said incidents like the pig's head and the ham should not overshadow the way the city has welcomed its latest arrivals from abroad. Overall, he said, the Somalis are winning acceptance. "All newcomers run into these bumps in the road. This is nothing different," he said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070512/ap_on_re_us/astronaut_arrested	Video shows former astronaut at airport - Yahoo! News Video shows former astronaut at airport By TRAVIS REED, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 10:39 PM ET ORLANDO, Fla. - Former astronaut Lisa Nowak waited nearly an hour at the airport for the romantic rival she is accused of attacking, donning a trenchcoat as the woman looked for her bags, a video released Friday shows. The security footage from Orlando International Airport depicts Nowak arriving at 12:33 a.m. Feb. 5, then following 10 to 15 yards behind Air Force Capt. Colleen Shipman as Shipman went to the baggage claim area. Police say Nowak raced the 900 miles from Houston to the Orlando airport to confront Shipman, wearing an astronaut diaper so that she would not have to stop. She was arrested in February after police say she attacked Shipman in the parking lot, shortly after the video was taken. Nowak, 44, has pleaded not guilty to attempted kidnapping, burglary with assault and battery. Authorities have said Nowak had an affair with Shipman's boyfriend, astronaut Bill Oefelein. The judge has asked the prosecution and defense to limit contact with the media, so neither police nor prosecutors would discuss the tape. Nowak's defense did not immediately return calls and e-mails left after-hours Friday. The video does not include footage of the alleged attack. Before Shipman arrives, Nowak goes off camera for about five minutes and reappears. Nowak stands and intermittently paces, carrying a bag on one shoulder. At one point she hurriedly walks to the baggage escalator, then reappears moments later. Shipman arrives about 50 minutes after the cameras show Nowak appear in the waiting area, and Nowak follows when she leaves. Nowak appears to be standing just a few feet away as Shipman waits for her bags. After a couple minutes, the former astronaut pulls on and buttons a light-colored trench coat.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070512/ap_on_re_us/astronaut_arrested	Video shows former astronaut at airport - Yahoo! News Video shows former astronaut at airport By TRAVIS REED, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 10:39 PM ET ORLANDO, Fla. - Former astronaut Lisa Nowak waited nearly an hour at the airport for the romantic rival she is accused of attacking, donning a trenchcoat as the woman looked for her bags, a video released Friday shows. The security footage from Orlando International Airport depicts Nowak arriving at 12:33 a.m. Feb. 5, then following 10 to 15 yards behind Air Force Capt. Colleen Shipman as Shipman went to the baggage claim area. Police say Nowak raced the 900 miles from Houston to the Orlando airport to confront Shipman, wearing an astronaut diaper so that she would not have to stop. She was arrested in February after police say she attacked Shipman in the parking lot, shortly after the video was taken. Nowak, 44, has pleaded not guilty to attempted kidnapping, burglary with assault and battery. Authorities have said Nowak had an affair with Shipman's boyfriend, astronaut Bill Oefelein. The judge has asked the prosecution and defense to limit contact with the media, so neither police nor prosecutors would discuss the tape. Nowak's defense did not immediately return calls and e-mails left after-hours Friday. The video does not include footage of the alleged attack. Before Shipman arrives, Nowak goes off camera for about five minutes and reappears. Nowak stands and intermittently paces, carrying a bag on one shoulder. At one point she hurriedly walks to the baggage escalator, then reappears moments later. Shipman arrives about 50 minutes after the cameras show Nowak appear in the waiting area, and Nowak follows when she leaves. Nowak appears to be standing just a few feet away as Shipman waits for her bags. After a couple minutes, the former astronaut pulls on and buttons a light-colored trench coat. The end of the tape, nearly three hours after Nowak's first security camera showing, shows someone with a light trenchcoat running. Authorities have said Nowak pepper-sprayed Shipman after knocking on her window and saying she needed help. Police said they found a BB gun, a new steel mallet, a knife and rubber tubing in Nowak's possession. released Nowak from the astronaut corps a month after her arrest.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070512/ap_on_re_us/boy_in_kennel	Woman gets prison for caging grandson - Yahoo! News Woman gets prison for caging grandson Sat May 12, 3:30 AM ET BRIGHTON, Colo. - A 62-year-old woman was sentenced to three years in prison for locking her grandson inside a dog kennel every night for three years while she went to work as a jail counselor. Under a plea bargain, June Candelario was also sentenced Friday to one year of probation. "I cannot imagine any society that would say it is just and fair to inflict this harm on a child that cannot protect himself," Adams County District Court Judge Harlan Bockman said. Candelario, a former state trooper, put the boy in a 4 foot by 3 foot kennel each day at 4 p.m. and let him out hours later when she returned from work, authorities said. She pleaded guilty to one felony count of conspiracy to commit child abuse that resulted in bodily harm and a misdemeanor count of child abuse. The boy was 10 when the abuse began and 13 when Candelario was arrested last May. "I felt like I was in a prison in my home," said a letter from the boy, which was read in court. "When I was in the cage, I felt scared and lonely and that I was not loved by my grandma." The boy's foster mother said the boy refused to attend sentencing because he remains afraid of Candelario.

News TV evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 By SUE LINDSEY, Associated Press Writer LYNCHBURG, Va. - The Rev. Jerry Falwell, the folksy, small-town preacher who used the power of television to found the Moral Majority and turn the Christian right into a mighty force in American politics during the Reagan years, died Tuesday at 73. Falwell was discovered without a pulse in his office at Liberty University and pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later. Dr. Carl Moore, Falwell's physician, said he had a heart condition and presumably died of a heart rhythm abnormality. Driven into politics by the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that established the right to an abortion, Falwell founded the Moral Majority in 1979. One of the conservative lobbying group's greatest triumphs came just a year later, when Falwell credited the Moral Majority with getting millions of conservative voters registered, aiding in Reagan's victory and giving Republicans control of the Senate. "I shudder to think where the country would be right now if the religious right had not evolved," he said when he stepped down as Moral Majority president in 1987. Fellow TV evangelist Pat Robertson, himself a one-time GOP candidate for president, declared Falwell "a tower of strength on many of the moral issues which have confronted our nation." The rise of Christian conservatism &#151; and the Moral Majority's full-throated condemnation of homosexuality, abortion and pornography &#151; made Falwell perhaps the most recognizable figure on the evangelical right, and one of the most controversial ones, too. Over the years, Falwell waged a landmark libel case against Hustler magazine founder Larry Flynt over a raunchy parody ad, and created a furor in 1999 when one of his publications suggested that the purse-carrying "Teletubbies" character Tinky Winky was gay. Matt Foreman, executive director of National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, extended condolences to those close to Falwell, but added: "Unfortunately, we will always remember him as a founder and leader of America's anti-gay industry, someone who exacerbated the nation's appalling response to the onslaught of the epidemic, someone who demonized and vilified us for political gain and someone who used religion to divide rather than unite our nation." The 1980s marked the religious conservative movement's high-water mark. In more recent years, Falwell had become a problematic figure for the GOP. His remarks a few days after Sept. 11, 2001, essentially blaming feminists, gays and liberals for bringing on the terrorist attacks drew a rebuke from the White House, and he apologized. Falwell's declining political star seemed apparent when he quietly led in and out of the Republican Party's 2004 national convention. Just four years earlier, he was invited to pray from the rostrum. The big, blue-eyed preacher with a booming voice started a fundamentalist church in an abandoned bottling plant in Lynchburg in 1956 with just 35 members. He built it into a religious empire that included the 22,000-member Thomas Road Baptist Church, the "Old Time Gospel Hour" carried on TV stations around the country and 7,700-student Liberty University, which Falwell founded in 1971 as Lynchburg Baptist College. From his living room, he broadcast his message of salvation and raised the donations that helped his ministry grow. "He was one of the first to come up with ways to use television to expand his ministry," said Robert Alley, a retired University of Richmond religion professor who studied and criticized Falwell's career. Falwell had once opposed mixing preaching with politics, but changed his views. The Moral Majority grew to 6.5 million members and raised $69 million as it supported conservative politicians and railed against abortion, homosexuality, pornography and bans on school prayer. Falwell became the face of the religious right, appearing on national magazine covers and on talk shows. In 1983, U.S. News & World Report named him one of 25 most influential people in America. "Dr. Falwell was a man of distinguished accomplishment who devoted his life to serving his faith and country," said Sen. John McCain ( ), a GOP presidential contender who during the 2000 primaries referred to Falwell and Robertson as "agents of intolerance." McCain has since distanced himself from those comments. In 1984, Falwell sued Hustler for $45 million, charging that he was libeled by an liquor-ad parody that quoted him as saying he lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse. A federal jury found the fake ad did not libel him, but awarded him $200,000 for emotional distress. The verdict was overturned in a landmark 1988 decision that held that even pornographic spoofs about a public figure enjoy First Amendment protection. With Falwell's high profile came frequent criticism, even from fellow ministers. The Rev. Billy Graham once rebuked him for political sermonizing on "non-moral issues." Falwell quit the Moral Majority in 1987, saying he was tired of being "a lightning rod" and wanted to devote his time to his ministry and Liberty University. But he remained outspoken and continued to draw criticism for his remarks. In 1999, he told an evangelical conference that the Antichrist was a male Jew who was probably already alive. Falwell later apologized for the remark but not for holding the belief. A month later, his National Liberty Journal warned parents that Tinky Winky, the children's TV character, was a gay role model and morally damaging to children. Falwell was re-energized after family values proved important in the 2004 presidential election. He formed the Faith and Values Coalition as the "21st Century resurrection of the Moral Majority," to seek anti-abortion judges, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and more conservative elected officials. In 1987, Falwell took over the PTL (Praise the Lord) ministry in South Carolina after the Rev. Jim Bakker got caught in a sex and money scandal. Falwell slid fully clothed down a theme park water slide after donors met his fundraising goal to help rescue the rival ministry. He gave it up seven months later after learning the depth of PTL's financial problems. Largely because of the sex scandals involving Bakker and fellow evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, donations to Falwell's ministry dropped from $135 million in 1986 to less than $100 million the following year. Hundreds of workers were laid off and viewers of his television show dwindled. Liberty University was $73 million in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy, and his "Old Time Gospel Hour" was $16 million in debt. By the mid-1990s, two local businessmen with long ties to Falwell began overseeing the finances and helped get companies to forgive debts or write them off. Falwell dreamed that Liberty would grow to 50,000 students and be to fundamentalist Christians what Notre Dame is to Roman Catholics and Brigham Young University is to Mormons. Falwell's father and his grandfather were militant atheists, he wrote in his autobiography. He said his father made a fortune off his businesses &#151; including bootlegging during Prohibition. As a student, Falwell was a star athlete and a prankster who was barred from giving his high school valedictorian's speech after he was caught using counterfeit lunch tickets. He ran with a gang of juvenile delinquents before becoming a born-again Christian at 19. He turned down an offer to play professional baseball and transferred from Lynchburg College to Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Mo. "My heart was burning to serve Christ," he once said in an interview. "I knew nothing would ever be the same again." Falwell had made careful preparations for a transition of his leadership to his two sons, Jerry Falwell, Jr., now vice chancellor of Liberty University, and Jonathan Falwell, executive the pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church. Falwell is survived by his wife, Macel, his two sons and a daughter, Jeannie Falwell Savas. Funeral arrangements were not immediately known. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Mormon whose own faith has become an issue during his run for the presidency, said Falwell "built and led a movement based on strong principles and strong faith," and "the legacy of his important work will continue through his many ministries where he put his faith into action."

News TV evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 By SUE LINDSEY, Associated Press Writer LYNCHBURG, Va. - The Rev. Jerry Falwell, the folksy, small-town preacher who used the power of television to found the Moral Majority and turn the Christian right into a mighty force in American politics during the Reagan years, died Tuesday at 73. Falwell was discovered without a pulse in his office at Liberty University and pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later. Dr. Carl Moore, Falwell's physician, said he had a heart condition and presumably died of a heart rhythm abnormality. Driven into politics by the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that established the right to an abortion, Falwell founded the Moral Majority in 1979. One of the conservative lobbying group's greatest triumphs came just a year later, when Falwell credited the Moral Majority with getting millions of conservative voters registered, aiding in Reagan's victory and giving Republicans control of the Senate.

News Groups: Block Texas town's immigrant ban By ANABELLE GARAY, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 28 minutes ago DALLAS - Latino activists and civil liberties advocates asked a federal judge Tuesday to block a voter-approved ordinance that prohibits landlords from renting apartments to most illegal immigrants in the Dallas suburb of Farmers Branch. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union American Civil Liberties Union , which have already sued the city, requested the temporary restraining order in U.S. District Court. The ordinance, scheduled to take effect next Tuesday, requires apartment managers to verify that renters are U.S. citizens or legal immigrants before leasing to them, with some exceptions. Violators face fines of up to $500. "It is unfortunate that the residents of Farmers Branch have chosen to implement a law which is not only bad policy, but is likely also unconstitutional," said Lisa Graybill, legal director for the ACLU of Texas. "Now the issue will have to be resolved in federal court." The city is preparing a response to the request, said Matthew Boyle, an attorney representing Farmers Branch. City council members first approved the ban in November without discussion, then revised it in January to include exemptions for minors, seniors and some mixed-status families. On Saturday, residents voted to approve the ban with 68 percent of voters in favor, according to unofficial results. Councilman Tim O'Hare, the ordinance's lead proponent, contends the city's economy and quality of life will improve if illegal immigrants are kept out. O'Hare declined to comment Tuesday. Since 1970, Farmers Branch has changed from a small, predominantly white bedroom community with a declining population to a city of almost 28,000 people, about 37 percent of them Hispanic, according to the U.S. Farmers Branch already faces four lawsuits brought by civil rights groups, residents, property owners and businesses, who say the ordinance discriminates and puts landlords in the precarious position of acting as federal immigration officers. Their attorneys argue the ordinance attempts to regulate immigration, a duty that is exclusively the federal government's. Nationwide, more than 90 local governments have proposed, passed or rejected laws prohibiting landlords from leasing to illegal immigrants, penalizing businesses that employ them or training police to enforce immigration laws.

News Child, teen swept away by Colo. flooding 1 hour, 42 minutes ago DENVER - Severe thunderstorms sent normally placid streams over their banks across the Denver area, sweeping away a 2-year-old boy in a stroller and a teenager who was trying to help with a rescue. Both were still missing Tuesday, police said. The toddler's mother had been out for a stroll Monday along a bike path that follows a creek near downtown. It had been a sunny morning, and the thunderstorm developed quickly. In less than an hour, it dumped more than an inch of rain, flooding streets and sending a torrent of water down the tiny creek. The woman sought refuge under a bridge as hail started to fall but realized she needed to leave the path, Denver Fire Department spokesman Phil Champagne said. "Once you enter (the bike path), you're in a chute," Champagne said. "She knew she was in trouble and was trying to get out. She was on the phone with her grandfather, trying to figure out a way out. "The water knocked her down, she was dragged for a little bit and was unable to hold onto the stroller," Champagne said. "What a tragic event. That poor mother to see her child swept away like that." Firefighters struggled against the current to rescue the woman, but her son and stroller were swept downstream. The stroller was later found empty more than a mile away in the South Platte River, Champagne said. Firefighters sent two divers to reach the mother as she clung to a concrete embankment. When she realized firefighters did not her son, she apparently released her grip and drifted downstream, where other firefighters pulled her from the water, Champagne said. In south Denver, a police officer and firefighters were able to save one teenager from a swollen creek in a park, but another teen who apparently was trying to help was swept away and remained missing, Champagne said. Rescuers searched Tuesday for the 2-year-old, believing he could have become stuck in the eddies of the South Platte River. A search for the teen was expected later. The officer was hospitalized with what appeared to be hypothermia, police spokesman John White said. The missing baby's mother was also hospitalized. Their names were not released.

By JEFF BARNARD, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 10:48 AM ET EUGENE, Ore. - Their guilt isn't in question. The six men and four women already admitted being involved in a series of arson fires that did $40 million in damage to research facilities, a ski resort and other businesses in the West. But are they terrorists as the government says? A federal judge was set to hear arguments Tuesday on a motion by the government to add a so-called terrorism enhancement to their sentences. Prosecutors want Judge Ann Aiken to declare the group terrorists &#151; something defense attorneys argue has never happened in 1,200 arsons nationwide claimed by Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front. The defense argues that branding their clients terrorists is more about politics than sentencing. "The Government has Attorney General Alberto Gonzales' political agenda to advance with this case, and nothing else to lose if the Court declines to impose the enhancement," wrote attorney Terri Wood, who represents Stanislas G. Meyerhoff. Meyerhoff faces the stiffest sentence recommendation for his involvement in seven fires and the toppling of a high-tension power line. The terrorism enhancement question will be settled in his case and, under an agreement with all parties, applied to the remaining defendants. Each has pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and arson. A ruling that the 10 are terrorists is not likely to boost the time they spend behind bars &#151; the prosecution recommends three to 16 years &#151; but it could land them in tougher prisons. The fires targeted forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer and, in 1998, Vail Ski Resort. No one was injured, the defense notes in legal motions. The case, known as Operation Backfire, is the biggest prosecution ever of environmental extremists, and has turned on its head the prevailing idea that arsonists have generally acted alone, said Brent Smith, director of the Terrorism Research Center at the University of Arkansas. "We thought these people operated for the last 15 years under this kind of uncoordinated violence approach, just like the extreme right was doing &#151; leaderless resistance," Smith said. "That's why this case is so very different." Prosecution filings argue that though the defendants were never convicted of terrorism, they qualify for the label because at least one of the fires each of them set was intended to change or retaliate against government policy.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/wildfires	Hundreds more flee massive Fla. wildfire - Yahoo! News Hundreds more flee massive Fla. wildfire By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 1:05 PM ET LAKE CITY, Fla. - Authorities evacuated hundreds of homes after a massive wildfire along the Georgia-Florida border jumped a containment line overnight, authorities said Tuesday. Firefighters pushed the flames back to the containment line, but dry weather and 15 mph wind in north Florida was expected to further hinder their work. "If we can just get through today," said Russell Hubright, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman. Between 250 and 500 homes west of U.S. 441 had to be evacuated for a second time when the fire line was breached, Florida Highway Patrol Lt. Michael Burroughs said. An additional 570 people who were ordered out of homes east of the roadway were still waiting to return. The wildfire had raced through the Okefenokee Swamp in southeast Georgia and into northern Florida after being started by lightning more than a week ago. By Tuesday, it had burned 109,000 acres in Florida and 139,813 acres of swampland in Georgia &#151; nearly 390 square miles in all. Flames jumped a containment line at the fire's western edge, but firefighters used bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters to extinguish them, said John Speaks, deputy incident commander with the forest service. The fire was about 1 1/2 miles from U.S. 441. On the western edge of the Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia, Fargo residents were told to stay alert as wind forecast at up to 20 mph pushed the blaze against fire breaks plowed between the swamp and the city of 380 people. "Everybody's being told not to let their guard down, don't unpack," said Laura Polant, a fire information officer in Fargo. "Residents are still being told to be prepared to leave, because the call can come at any time." In Florida, the blaze was 50 percent contained Tuesday. The smoke had lifted enough to open Interstates 10 and 75 to traffic, but drivers were warned that periodic closures were still possible. Another large wildfire, in northeastern Minnesota and Ontario, could be brought under control by the end of the week, officials said. No one has been seriously hurt in the fire, which has burned 117 square miles of Minnesota and Canada, but many cabins and smaller structures &#151; more than 100 in all &#151; have been destroyed. Associated Press writers Russ Bynum in Savannah, Ga., and Jennifer Kay in Miami contributed to this report.

News Hundreds more flee massive Fla. wildfire By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 1:05 PM ET LAKE CITY, Fla. - Authorities evacuated hundreds of homes after a massive wildfire along the Georgia-Florida border jumped a containment line overnight, authorities said Tuesday. Firefighters pushed the flames back to the containment line, but dry weather and 15 mph wind in north Florida was expected to further hinder their work. "If we can just get through today," said Russell Hubright, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman. Between 250 and 500 homes west of U.S. 441 had to be evacuated for a second time when the fire line was breached, Florida Highway Patrol Lt. Michael Burroughs said. An additional 570 people who were ordered out of homes east of the roadway were still waiting to return. The wildfire had raced through the Okefenokee Swamp in southeast Georgia and into northern Florida after being started by lightning more than a week ago. By Tuesday, it had burned 109,000 acres in Florida and 139,813 acres of swampland in Georgia &#151; nearly 390 square miles in all. Flames jumped a containment line at the fire's western edge, but firefighters used bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters to extinguish them, said John Speaks, deputy incident commander with the forest service. The fire was about 1 1/2 miles from U.S. 441. On the western edge of the Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia, Fargo residents were told to stay alert as wind forecast at up to 20 mph pushed the blaze against fire breaks plowed between the swamp and the city of 380 people. "Everybody's being told not to let their guard down, don't unpack," said Laura Polant, a fire information officer in Fargo. "Residents are still being told to be prepared to leave, because the call can come at any time." In Florida, the blaze was 50 percent contained Tuesday. The smoke had lifted enough to open Interstates 10 and 75 to traffic, but drivers were warned that periodic closures were still possible. Another large wildfire, in northeastern Minnesota and Ontario, could be brought under control by the end of the week, officials said. No one has been seriously hurt in the fire, which has burned 117 square miles of Minnesota and Canada, but many cabins and smaller structures &#151; more than 100 in all &#151; have been destroyed. Associated Press writers Russ Bynum in Savannah, Ga., and Jennifer Kay in Miami contributed to this report.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/padilla_terror_charges	CIA agent testifies at Padilla trial - Yahoo! News CIA agent testifies at Padilla trial By CURT ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 34 minutes ago MIAMI - A covert officer permitted to testify wearing a disguise and using an alias described in court Tuesday how U.S. officials in obtained a truckload of al-Qaida documents, including a form later linked to alleged operative Jose Padilla. The officer, whose true identity is classified, gave his name as Tom Langston. He appeared in court with a beard and glasses, although the nature of the disguise was not obvious or made public. Prosecutors declined to say if any concealment was even used. The arrangement was approved by U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke at the request of the CIA, which sought to protect the officer's ability to continue doing clandestine work overseas. It was not disclosed to the jury. Langston testified that he was working in December 2001 at a classified CIA site in Kandahar, Afghanistan, when an Afghan man driving a pickup truck showed up with thousands of pages of documents. Among them was a bright blue binder containing what appeared to be dozens of forms in Arabic, one of which allegedly turned out to be Padilla's. Prosecutors say his fingerprints are on the "mujahedeen data form," which had questions on language skills, military experience, religious education and other areas. The form is crucial to the government's case because it could link Padilla and his two alleged co-conspirators &#151; Adham Amin Hassoun and Kifah Wael Jayyousi &#151; to al-Qaida. The three are charged with being part of a U.S.-based support cell for Islamic extremists around the world, including al-Qaida. The unidentified Afghan man, Langston said, was affiliated with an Afghan tribal leader opposed to the country's Islamic fundamentalist Taliban rulers, who were then battling U.S. forces. Under the Taliban, al-Qaida had established terrorist training camps in Afghanistan in the years leading to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. "He was loyal to some individuals who were cooperating with us against the Taliban and the terrorist element," the CIA officer said. The Afghan man told the CIA he collected the documents from a house occupied by Arabs who had fled shortly before the 2001 U.S. invasion and were known locally to be affiliated with al-Qaida. Langston said the man was not paid or given any other benefit by U.S. officials for the documents, although he was prohibited after prosecutors objected from answering questions about whether the man's tribal leader was compensated. "I think he took this initiative on his own," the CIA officer said of the man who brought the documents. At one point, Langston grew reluctant to answer a question from Padilla attorney Orlando do Campo about how CIA officers and analysts handle documents such as those in the binder. "I'm a little uncomfortable answering the question because it gets into methods. I'm sworn to protect sources and methods," he said. The binder and other documents were kept in a locked room at the CIA installation in Kandahar, then placed in boxes and transported on U.S. vehicles and aircraft to the in Islamabad, Pakistan. The binder was in a box labeled "vegetable oil," the CIA officer said. The FBI legal attache there in late 2001, Jennifer Keenan, testified Tuesday that she remembered the binder among 22 boxes, trunks and other containers because it appeared to hold information important for U.S. counterterrorism investigators. "We were very grateful to find this," Keenan said. "I called it a pledge form. It says pledge on it." It wasn't until later that the FBI in Washington was able to link one of the forms to Padilla, who allegedly filled it out under the name Abu Abdullah al-Mujahir in July 2000. A key to making that link was information gathered during U.S. interrogations of other alleged al-Qaida figures, according to documents filed in the Padilla case. Padilla, a 36-year-old former Chicago gang member and U.S. citizen, was arrested by the FBI in May 2002 when he arrived at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The Bush administration initially accused him of plotting to detonate a radioactive "dirty bomb" in a U.S. city, but those allegations are not part of the criminal indictment. Padilla was added to the Miami case after 3 1/2 years in military custody as an enemy combatant. His case was the subject of a lengthy legal battle over the president's wartime detention powers over U.S. citizens. Padilla and his two co-defendants face up to life in prison if convicted on all charges.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/katrina_opportunity	New Orleans neighborhood rescues itself - Yahoo! News New Orleans neighborhood rescues itself By JOHN MORENO GONZALES, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 2:09 PM ET NEW ORLEANS - Paul Pablovich was the very picture of a good neighbor as he shoveled debris off the curb and mowed other people's lawns in Lakeview, a middle-class section of town that was swamped with 15 feet of water during Hurricane Katrina and is now a patchwork of gutted and newly built homes. But he wasn't doing it entirely out of the goodness of his heart. He was protecting his investment. Pablovich, an entrepreneur who lived in a different part of New Orleans before Katrina, bought a bungalow on the street from an elderly resident after the storm, renovated it and plans to live there with his fiancee. He purchased a second abandoned house for $107,000, fixed it up and hopes to resell it for $214,000. He would like to "flip" several other properties on the block, too. The way he sees it, capitalism is the road to recovery for Lakeview. "It's how the country was built," Pablovich, 38, said of the $600,000 he has pumped into the real estate market. "Free-market economics will kick in." Lakeview, a 7,000-home mostly white enclave in a city that is predominantly black, has emerged as a success story in the reconstruction of New Orleans through entrepreneurs like Pablovich and strong civic organization that existed long before the storm. In contrast, hard-hit black middle-class neighborhoods in eastern New Orleans do not have the same financial means and civic organization, and are not drawing nearly as much private investment. As a result, their recovery is crawling. "If you're going to speculate, you're much more likely to speculate in Lakeview than you would in the east," said Louisiana State University sociology professor Jeanne Hulbert. "But you could end up, potentially, with a social and economic structure in the city that really carves out the black middle class." Nearly 21 months after Katrina, Lakeview has lights and other utilities, but still has no firehouse and no public school. But it is a community so fiercely independent it tried in the 1990s to secede from the city. And its residents &#151; who include business executives and other professionals &#151; have considerable organizational skills. Lakeview's churches arranged for volunteers around the country to plant trees along Canal Boulevard, the main drag. And recently, nearly 1,000 original and potential new residents came to a civic association tutorial on how to navigate the city's bureaucracy and find a reputable contractor. In fact, the civic association drew up a list of recommended contractors by running credit checks on them and consulting the Better Business Bureau. The group is so organized it has compiled its own data on rebuilding, finding in a February survey that 67 percent of Lakeview's lots were in some stage of transformation. Seventeen percent were newly inhabited, just over 26 percent were under repair, and 23 percent had been demolished to pave the way for rebuilding. In contrast, neighborhood leaders in eastern New Orleans, which encompasses four ZIP codes to Lakeview's one, are just now undertaking a house-to-house count. Independent research, at first glance, suggests Lakeview and eastern New Orleans have rebuilt at similar rates. GCR and Associates Inc. found last week that based on utility hookups, close to 36 percent of residents in the Lakeview ZIP code were back, versus 33 percent in the eastern New Orleans ZIP codes. However, Richard Campanella, associate director of Tulane and Xavier universities' Center for Biomedical Research, found that the flooding in Lakeview was, by some measures, far more severe. For example, nearly 22 percent of homes in Lakeview got more than 8 feet of water, compared with 3.5 percent in eastern New Orleans. Lakeview has eclipsed eastern New Orleans in real estate sales since Katrina. Sixty-nine houses were sold there nine months before the disaster, compared with 147 during the past nine months of recovery, a 113 percent jump. In eastern New Orleans, 215 single-family homes were sold in the nine months before Katrina, and 287 during the past nine months, a 33 percent increase. As he painted over the rust on an iron fence that ringed his family's home in eastern New Orleans, Hank Long said it was obvious to him that his part of town was rebuilding with sweat equity more often than financial equity. "In Lakeview, many of those houses were already paid for. A lot of people are still paying their mortgages here," said Long, a 60-year-old black man. "Nobody has big money here. They gutted out their house, and that's as far as they got. Whatever they could do, they did on their own." Hulbert of LSU said: "You have to remember the black middle class only took hold in the 1960s. That is different from several generations of middle-class life. Many middle-class blacks in New Orleans were the first in their families to go to college, and it appears many had their entire savings tied up in their homes." David Bell, president of the East New Orleans Neighborhood Advisory Commission, which formed in March to bind together 15 area groups, said a lack of private investment means eastern New Orleans is much more dependent on government recovery aid, with all the bureaucracy and politics that entails. For example, a centerpiece of the eastern New Orleans redevelopment plan is a proposed $100 million shopping strip. But federal grants for the project will not be fully released until the city comes up with 10 percent. Back in Lakeview, residents like to say that they ask mostly one thing of the city: for it to get out of the way. TKTMJ Inc., a builder that is selling modular homes in the neighborhood, found the area so profitable that it established an office in Lakeview and has dubbed one of its designs "The Lakeview." Tommy Callia, a sales representative with the company, noted that most of those able to rebuild are middle class and white. "I think we're not going to be as diverse as we once were, and that's going to be sad," he said. "You can say it's a little like a gumbo: If you don't have all the ingredients, something is missing in the taste."

Sixty-nine houses were sold there nine months before the disaster, compared with 147 during the past nine months of recovery, a 113 percent jump. In eastern New Orleans, 215 single-family homes were sold in the nine months before Katrina, and 287 during the past nine months, a 33 percent increase. As he painted over the rust on an iron fence that ringed his family's home in eastern New Orleans, Hank Long said it was obvious to him that his part of town was rebuilding with sweat equity more often than financial equity. "In Lakeview, many of those houses were already paid for. A lot of people are still paying their mortgages here," said Long, a 60-year-old black man. "Nobody has big money here. They gutted out their house, and that's as far as they got. Whatever they could do, they did on their own." Hulbert of LSU said: "You have to remember the black middle class only took hold in the 1960s. That is different from several generations of middle-class life. Many middle-class blacks in New Orleans were the first in their families to go to college, and it appears many had their entire savings tied up in their homes." David Bell, president of the East New Orleans Neighborhood Advisory Commission, which formed in March to bind together 15 area groups, said a lack of private investment means eastern New Orleans is much more dependent on government recovery aid, with all the bureaucracy and politics that entails. For example, a centerpiece of the eastern New Orleans redevelopment plan is a proposed $100 million shopping strip. But federal grants for the project will not be fully released until the city comes up with 10 percent. Back in Lakeview, residents like to say that they ask mostly one thing of the city: for it to get out of the way. TKTMJ Inc., a builder that is selling modular homes in the neighborhood, found the area so profitable that it established an office in Lakeview and has dubbed one of its designs "The Lakeview." Tommy Callia, a sales representative with the company, noted that most of those able to rebuild are middle class and white. "I think we're not going to be as diverse as we once were, and that's going to be sad," he said. "You can say it's a little like a gumbo: If you don't have all the ingredients, something is missing in the taste."

News World mayors hold climate summit in NYC By SARA KUGLER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 12:18 PM ET NEW YORK - City leaders from around the globe gathered Tuesday for an environmental summit hosted by former and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg with a message that the campaign to reverse global warming begins with the world's mayors. "It is in cities that the battle to tackle climate change will be won or lost," London Mayor Ken Livingstone said. Mayors and local leaders from more than 30 cities kicked off the conference, known as the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit, which first met in 2005 in London. Organizers say cities bear a significant responsibility to address climate change because they cover less than 1 percent of the Earth's surface but generate 80 percent of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. "Our theme is not whether we should work together, because we know that we must, it is how and how fast we can do so," New York's Deputy Mayor Dan Doctoroff said. The summit includes mayors from Seoul to Sao Paulo, Albuquerque to Addis Ababa. The meeting comes at a time when many countries are struggling to address global and national standards for carbon reduction. This week, U.N. delegates are meeting in Germany to gear up for December negotiations on a new set of international rules for controlling greenhouse gas emissions. The new accord would succeed the Kyoto Protocol, which ends in 2012. When the Group of Eight major industrialized countries &#151; the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and Russia &#151; met in Germany in June, climate change will also be on the agenda. Meanwhile, the mayors said Tuesday, local governments can't wait around. "Where national governments can't or won't lead, cities will," Toronto Mayor David Miller said. In a discussion on transportation, the mayor of the Brazilian city of Curitiba described his city's solutions, which include a Bus Rapid Transit system, while Livingstone described London's program to reduce traffic by charging motorists extra money in the city center. Bloomberg recently announced his intention to begin a similar traffic charging program in Manhattan. London traffic congestion dropped by 20 percent, and carbon emissions in the central zone similarly decreased, Livingstone said. The fee &#151; equal to about $16 &#151; has gone up since it started in 2003. "People may not like paying the 5 pounds a day, but they certainly didn't want to live with that style of congestion," Livingstone said. He said his city's next goal is to charge more for higher-polluting cars, a pricing scale that could mean a $50 equivalent charge for the worst offenders. Organizers of the conference, which ends Thursday, also invited a number of business leaders to this year's gathering in an effort to involve the private sector. They hope to convince companies that going green &#151; through innovative construction, transportation alternatives and other environmental changes &#151; is a profitable economic move.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/climate_summit	World mayors hold climate summit in NYC - Yahoo! News World mayors hold climate summit in NYC By SARA KUGLER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 12:18 PM ET NEW YORK - City leaders from around the globe gathered Tuesday for an environmental summit hosted by former and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg with a message that the campaign to reverse global warming begins with the world's mayors. "It is in cities that the battle to tackle climate change will be won or lost," London Mayor Ken Livingstone said. Mayors and local leaders from more than 30 cities kicked off the conference, known as the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit, which first met in 2005 in London. Organizers say cities bear a significant responsibility to address climate change because they cover less than 1 percent of the Earth's surface but generate 80 percent of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. "Our theme is not whether we should work together, because we know that we must, it is how and how fast we can do so," New York's Deputy Mayor Dan Doctoroff said. The summit includes mayors from Seoul to Sao Paulo, Albuquerque to Addis Ababa. The meeting comes at a time when many countries are struggling to address global and national standards for carbon reduction. This week, U.N. delegates are meeting in Germany to gear up for December negotiations on a new set of international rules for controlling greenhouse gas emissions. The new accord would succeed the Kyoto Protocol, which ends in 2012. When the Group of Eight major industrialized countries &#151; the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and Russia &#151; met in Germany in June, climate change will also be on the agenda. Meanwhile, the mayors said Tuesday, local governments can't wait around. "Where national governments can't or won't lead, cities will," Toronto Mayor David Miller said. In a discussion on transportation, the mayor of the Brazilian city of Curitiba described his city's solutions, which include a Bus Rapid Transit system, while Livingstone described London's program to reduce traffic by charging motorists extra money in the city center. Bloomberg recently announced his intention to begin a similar traffic charging program in Manhattan. London traffic congestion dropped by 20 percent, and carbon emissions in the central zone similarly decreased, Livingstone said. The fee &#151; equal to about $16 &#151; has gone up since it started in 2003. "People may not like paying the 5 pounds a day, but they certainly didn't want to live with that style of congestion," Livingstone said. He said his city's next goal is to charge more for higher-polluting cars, a pricing scale that could mean a $50 equivalent charge for the worst offenders. Organizers of the conference, which ends Thursday, also invited a number of business leaders to this year's gathering in an effort to involve the private sector. They hope to convince companies that going green &#151; through innovative construction, transportation alternatives and other environmental changes &#151; is a profitable economic move.

News Cruise ship runs aground off Alaska By ANNE SUTTON, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 5:11 AM ET JUNEAU, Alaska - When the Empress of the North ran aground, the band played on &#151; as everyone disembarked in a safe and orderly fashion. Passengers jolted awake by the ship hitting a charted reef 50 miles southwest of Juneau early Monday were ordered to don lifejackets and gather in the ballroom, where a singer and piano player entertained them with songs including "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" as they waited for rescue. Passengers praised the ship's crew for taking charge. "They just seemed to know what they were doing. They were caring, courteous, the whole thing, and I think that's what kept everybody calm," said Mary Crosby, 83, of Seattle. National Transportation Safety Board National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the grounding of the riverboat-style cruise ship, which had 206 passengers and 75 crew members on board. One person was taken to a hospital for observation, a Juneau city official said. When Coast Guard helicopters reached the area, the vessel was listing at the southern end of Icy Strait and had begun taking on water, the Coast Guard said. As the ship's pumps worked to remove the water, the passengers were transferred safely to other boats in the area and then to an Alaska state ferry to be taken to Juneau. The Empress of the North floated free of the rock during the evacuation, and the crew was able to stabilize the ship, said the Coast Guard. The ship arrived in Juneau with a Coast Guard escort about nine hours after the grounding. The ferry Columbia arrived shortly after. State officials said the hull sustained significant damage and an empty fuel tank was breached during the grounding. A light oil sheen was seen in the area but officials were uncertain if the ship was the source. Coast Guard Petty Officer Barry Lane said Coast Guard inspectors did an initial survey of the ship as it was moored in Juneau's Auke Bay and will pass the information on to the NTSB. It wasn't immediately clear why the cruise ship ran aground, said Coast Guard officials. It was drizzling in Juneau but the seas were calm. Good Samaritans were first on the scene of the grounding and passengers were initially evacuated onto lifeboats, a charter fishing boat, a tugboat, another small cruise ship and a coast guard cutter before the Columbia arrived. "The morning was incredible. You had anybody and everybody that could get there and they all got there as quick as they could and all were willing to help out," said Coast Guard Capt. Mark Guillory, federal on-scene coordinator. Passengers left the ship with only their personal identification and medications. They were to be reunited with their belongings later in Juneau. All had been flown to Seattle by evening, said company officials. "It couldn't have been better orchestrated the way things fell into place," said Chief Petty Officer Barry Lane. The Empress of the North is operated by Majestic America Line of Seattle. The ship has 112 staterooms, a three-story paddlewheel and galleries featuring Native American masks and Russian artwork, including Faberge eggs, according to its Web site. The 360-foot ship is less than half the size of the average cruise ship in the Caribbean, and is also dwarfed by most cruise other ships off the Alaska coast. The grounding occurred on the second day of a seven-day cruise, said Dan Miller, a spokesman for Majestic America. The American-built ship is billed by the company as the only overnight paddlewheel vessel in use on Alaska cruises. It also is used on cruises on the Columbia River between Washington state and Oregon. The Empress of the North has had other problems since it began operating in mid-2003. In October of that year, it hit a navigation lock on the Snake River in Washington. It has also run aground at least twice before &#151; once after developing steering problems on the Columbia River, and once on a sandbar near Washougal, Wash., as it tried to avoid a barge.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/pesticides_schools	AP: Children face exposure to pesticides - Yahoo! News AP: Children face exposure to pesticides By GARANCE BURKE, Associated Press Writer STRATHMORE, Calif. - On Grandparents Day, Domitila Lemus accompanied her 8-year-old granddaughter to school. As the girls lined up behind Sunnyside Union Elementary, a foul mist drifted onto the playground from the adjacent orange groves, witnesses say. Lemus started coughing, and two children collapsed in spasms, vomiting on the blacktop. She and the little girls have since recovered without apparent lasting effects. But an Associated Press investigation has found that over the past decade, hundreds &#151; possibly thousands &#151; of schoolchildren in California and other agricultural states have been exposed to farm chemicals linked to sickness, brain damage and birth defects. The family of at least one California teenager suspects pesticides caused her death. There are no federal laws specifically against spraying near schools, and advocates say California and the seven other states that have laws or policies creating buffer zones around schools to protect them from pesticides don't do enough to enforce them. "The regulations are inadequate. In the vast majority of cases, people who didn't follow the laws received at best a $400 fine," said Margaret Reeves, a scientist with the Pesticide Action Network, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco. The pesticide industry says it is committed to safety, and regulators say they are doing their best to enforce the laws. "Everyone wants to protect children," said California Department of Pesticide Regulation spokesman Glenn Brank. He said his agency is doing what it can to enforce the law with a shortage of agricultural inspectors. In the Strathmore incident last November, grandparents said the spraying was being done less than 150 feet from the children. Tulare County authorities fined an unlicensed pest removal company $1,100 for spraying a restricted weed killer that morning. But no action was taken over what witnesses said happened to the children. Because no one reported the incident as a case of pesticide drift, county agricultural inspectors never swabbed the jungle gym or took grass samples, making it impossible to establish whether pesticide had, in fact, drifted onto the playground. does not keep comprehensive national figures on students and teachers sickened by drifting pesticide. In California, the No. 1 farm state and the one with the best records, there were 590 pesticide-related illnesses at schools from 1996 to 2005, according to figures given to the AP by the state. More than a third of those were due to pesticide drift, the figures show. Activists say that those numbers are low and that many cases are never even reported. In California's long, flat interior, spraying season lasts seven months, from March through September. When citrus trees blossom and grapevines climb trellises, Lemus prays to the Virgin Mary that her granddaughter won't come home with her eyes watering and head pounding, unable to breathe. Tulare County, where she lives, is one of the nation's most fertile farm regions, with more than half the schools within a quarter-mile of agricultural fields, according to the nonprofit Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment. As suburbs push close to farmland, the rate of pesticide poisoning among children nationwide has risen in recent years, according to a 2005 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association Journal of the American Medical Association . The study found that 40 percent of all children sickened by pesticides at school were victims of drift &#151; pesticide carried on the breeze. Research on pregnant women exposed to common pesticides has suggested higher rates of premature birth, and poor neurological development and smaller head circumferences among their babies. The effects on children of small, repeated exposures over a long period of time are unclear, said University of California, Berkeley epidemiologist Brenda Eskenazi. But acute pesticide poisoning can cause nausea, blurred vision, an abnormally fast heart rate, paralysis and death. Chrissy Garavito, a 15-year-old high school sophomore, died in Fontana in 1997 of a heart rhythm disturbance her mother believes was triggered by exposure to chemicals sprayed at the school. Authorities never confirmed that pesticides contributed to her death. In 2001, pesticide poisoning nearly killed Elena Dominguez, then a sixth-grader in Wenatchee, Wash. One day, after playing Frisbee during gym class across the street from an apple orchard, she passed out at her desk. "She was in a stupor," said her mother, Cindy Dominguez. "She couldn't talk, her eyes were rolling back in her head." Emergency room doctors dismissed Elena's abnormally fast heart rate as a symptom of dehydration, gave her intravenous fluids and sent her home. Three weeks later, it happened again. "I was at a track meet and all of a sudden I felt really, really tired," said Elena, now 18. "I made it to the finish line and just fell over." Investigators found her clothes were soaked in the pesticide Endosulfan I; it had been picked up from residue on the grass and absorbed into her bloodstream through her skin. Officials later found five other pesticides on school grounds and fined the apple grower for forging his applicator's license. The Dominguez family sued the orchard owner and the Wenatchee school district, which established rules requiring students to stay inside after a spraying, among other things. State officials believe it is the only district in Washington with such limitations. But keeping students inside may not be enough. Two years ago, 600 students and staff members were evacuated from an Edinburg, Texas, elementary school after pesticides drifted from a cotton field into the school's air conditioning system. Thirty-nine people developed nausea and headaches. EPA officials say they have no real idea how often pesticides waft onto school grounds. The EPA must register pesticides before they are sold, but federal law does not restrict where they can be sprayed. "We implement the laws that Congress gives us," said Ruth Allen, an EPA epidemiologist. Once the EPA approves a product, federal law requires manufacturers to report any "unreasonable adverse effects on the environment of the pesticide" that their products cause. Activists say industry is essentially allowed to police itself. CropLife America, a national organization representing suppliers of farm pesticides, said their use near schools is well-regulated. "We're really committed to public safety," said spokeswoman Donna Uchida. "Any kind of use of a pesticide has a labeling requirement that is imposed to protect human health and the environment." California has some of the strictest pesticide laws in the nation. Under state law, growers and pest control companies can be fined if pesticide drifts from a field and sickens people. A 2002 state law allows county authorities to establish a no-spray buffer zone of a quarter-mile around schools. But Tulare County has not done so. State officials said they did not know how many counties have set up such buffer zones. Lemus and environmentalists are pushing for pesticide-free zones throughout California. "Why don't they tell us they'll spray beforehand so we can bring our children inside?" Lemus said.

News Conn. high court mulls gay marriage case By STEPHANIE REITZ, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 5:27 AM ET HARTFORD, Conn. - The long-simmering question of whether same-sex couples in Connecticut should be allowed to marry is now in the hands of seven state Supreme Court justices. Arguments in the potentially groundbreaking case wrapped up in about three hours Monday, but it likely will be months before justices rule on the lawsuit that eight same-sex couples originally filed in August 2004. The couples, who have been together between 13 and 31 years, allege their equal protection and due process were violated when they were denied marriage licenses in Madison Town Hall. Their case also raises questions about whether the state's 2005 civil unions law &#151; the first adopted nationwide without court pressure &#151; helped or hurt same-sex couples in their quest for equality. The plaintiffs want the court to rule that the state's marriage law discriminates against them because it applies only to heterosexual couples, therefore denying gay couples the financial, social and emotional benefits of marriage. "What is denied to these families is something that goes to the heart of equal protection, which is the right to be part of the fabric of society when they are just the same as other couples and other families," said their attorney, Bennett Klein. The state argued Monday that Connecticut's civil unions law gives the couples the equality they seek, and that the issue is a policy question best left to lawmakers rather than judges. "All of those rights and benefits, at least under state law, have been granted," Assistant Attorney General Jane Rosenberg said. "From a legal perspective, there are no rights that have been taken away from that group and, in fact, equal rights have now been given to that group." As several states consider civil union laws, the Connecticut case could have nationwide ramifications. People on both sides said Monday they are well aware of its significance. "Our 9-year-old said it best: 'How is the world supposed to get better if nothing changes?'" said Geraldine Artis of Clinton, who is a plaintiff along with her partner of 13 years, Suzanne Artis. One recurring theme at Monday's hearing was whether gays and lesbians should be considered a protected group, a legal term for a segment of the population that, among other things, is particularly vulnerable to discrimination and lacks political power. Peter Wolfgang, public policy director for the Family Institute of Connecticut, which opposes same-sex marriage, said that claim is weak. He cited the existence of Connecticut's civil unions law, the growing number of openly gay lawmakers in powerful positions, and a recent legislative committee vote in favor of same-sex marriages. "I think it would be very hard to argue that gays and lesbians are powerless in Connecticut in 2007," Wolfgang said after the hearing. If justices agree with the same-sex couples, they could order the case back to the trial court, with instructions to rule in favor of the couples. They could also order the General Assembly to consider overhauling the current marriage laws. Currently, only Massachusetts allows same-sex couples to marry. Connecticut, Vermont, California, New Jersey, Maine and Washington have laws allowing either civil unions or domestic partnerships, and a civil unions law is expected to take effect in New Hampshire in January.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/gay_marriage	Conn. high court mulls gay marriage case - Yahoo! News Conn. high court mulls gay marriage case By STEPHANIE REITZ, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 5:27 AM ET HARTFORD, Conn. - The long-simmering question of whether same-sex couples in Connecticut should be allowed to marry is now in the hands of seven state Supreme Court justices. Arguments in the potentially groundbreaking case wrapped up in about three hours Monday, but it likely will be months before justices rule on the lawsuit that eight same-sex couples originally filed in August 2004. The couples, who have been together between 13 and 31 years, allege their equal protection and due process were violated when they were denied marriage licenses in Madison Town Hall. Their case also raises questions about whether the state's 2005 civil unions law &#151; the first adopted nationwide without court pressure &#151; helped or hurt same-sex couples in their quest for equality. The plaintiffs want the court to rule that the state's marriage law discriminates against them because it applies only to heterosexual couples, therefore denying gay couples the financial, social and emotional benefits of marriage. "What is denied to these families is something that goes to the heart of equal protection, which is the right to be part of the fabric of society when they are just the same as other couples and other families," said their attorney, Bennett Klein. The state argued Monday that Connecticut's civil unions law gives the couples the equality they seek, and that the issue is a policy question best left to lawmakers rather than judges. "All of those rights and benefits, at least under state law, have been granted," Assistant Attorney General Jane Rosenberg said. "From a legal perspective, there are no rights that have been taken away from that group and, in fact, equal rights have now been given to that group." As several states consider civil union laws, the Connecticut case could have nationwide ramifications. People on both sides said Monday they are well aware of its significance. "Our 9-year-old said it best: 'How is the world supposed to get better if nothing changes?'" said Geraldine Artis of Clinton, who is a plaintiff along with her partner of 13 years, Suzanne Artis. One recurring theme at Monday's hearing was whether gays and lesbians should be considered a protected group, a legal term for a segment of the population that, among other things, is particularly vulnerable to discrimination and lacks political power. Peter Wolfgang, public policy director for the Family Institute of Connecticut, which opposes same-sex marriage, said that claim is weak. He cited the existence of Connecticut's civil unions law, the growing number of openly gay lawmakers in powerful positions, and a recent legislative committee vote in favor of same-sex marriages. "I think it would be very hard to argue that gays and lesbians are powerless in Connecticut in 2007," Wolfgang said after the hearing. If justices agree with the same-sex couples, they could order the case back to the trial court, with instructions to rule in favor of the couples. They could also order the General Assembly to consider overhauling the current marriage laws. Currently, only Massachusetts allows same-sex couples to marry. Connecticut, Vermont, California, New Jersey, Maine and Washington have laws allowing either civil unions or domestic partnerships, and a civil unions law is expected to take effect in New Hampshire in January. Hawaii extends certain spousal rights to same-sex couples and cohabiting heterosexual pairs. Full Coverage: Gay & Lesbian Issues Anglican church turmoil over gay issues deepens Reuters via Yahoo!

News Miami holds top spot on rude driver list By SARAH LARIMER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 9:07 AM ET MIAMI - For the second straight year, rude Miami drivers have earned the city the title of worst road rage in a survey released Tuesday. Miami motorists said they saw other drivers slam on their brakes, run red lights and talk on cell phones, according to AutoVantage, a Connecticut-based automobile membership club offering travel services and roadside assistance. Other cities near the top of the rude drivers list were New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. South Miami resident Erik Pinto told The Associated Press he's probably seen every bad driving habit on Miami's roads. "You don't want to know what I've seen," Pinto said. "I've seen everything. I'm from L.A., and we don't see the crazy drivers that you see here." Portland, Ore., drivers were the least likely of the cities to see other motorists tailgating on the roadways, and St. Louis motorists were the least likely to swear at another driver, the survey found. Minneapolis-St. Paul was rated the most courteous city in 2006 but slipped to the middle of the list this year. The most frequent cause of road rage cited in the survey was impatient motorists. Drivers also cited poor driving in fast lanes and driving while stressed, frustrated or angry. "The best piece of advice is to take a deep breath. Slow down, be aware and be careful," AutoVantage spokesman Todd Smith said, adding the aim of the survey is to increase driver safety across the nation. More than 2,500 drivers who regularly commute in 25 major metropolitan areas were asked to rate road rage and rude driving in telephone surveys between January and March. The survey was conducted by Prince Market Research has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/fort_drum_missing_soldiers	Missing soldiers from Fort Drum - Yahoo! News Missing soldiers from Fort Drum FORT DRUM, N.Y. - The seven American victims of a weekend ambush in were members of the storied 10th Mountain Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Army officials in Iraq said Tuesday. The attack near Mahmoudiya, in a Sunni stronghold 20 miles south of Baghdad, left four U.S. soldiers and an Iraqi translator dead, and three other soldiers missing. acknowledged for the first time that it believes the missing soldiers are in terrorist hands. The Islamic State of Iraq &#151; an al-Qaida front group that has claimed to have captured the soldiers &#151; has warned the U.S. to stop its massive search for the missing. Military officials would not release the names of the soldiers until their families were notified but confirmed they were assigned to Company D, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, nicknamed the "Polar Bears," said Lt. Col. Paul Fitzpatrick, a Fort Drum spokesman. All the missing soldiers are men, Fitzpatrick said. "It's been the unfortunate experience that soldiers who have been captured have not all turned out well. We are hoping this turns out to be an exception," he said. The 10th Mountain Division has a reputation for success that dates to World War II. Ready to go anywhere in the world within 48 hours, the 10th Mountain is trained to fight in steamy jungles, sandy deserts, cities and, of course, mountains. Families of the soldiers released the names of two of the dead on Monday &#151; Sgt. 1st Class James David Connell Jr., 40, of Lake City, Tenn., and Pfc. Daniel Courneya, 19, of Vermontville, Mich. Connell's family learned of his death Saturday afternoon, they said. The soldier had just recovered from a shrapnel wound to the leg and had visited his family on leave this month. The family is now planning a memorial service in Lake City and a burial at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his brother, Jeff Connell. "I'm proud of my dad, because he didn't really fight for himself, he fought for the country," Connell's teenage daughter, Courtney, told Knoxville's WATE-TV. In Michigan, students at Maple Valley High School created a memorial for Courneya, who graduated in 2005 and was well-known in the small community southwest of Lansing. He was a member of the school's track and soccer teams and played clarinet in the band. "It's a tribute of photos, posters, plaques and a picture of him in his uniform," school official Kelly Zank told The Associated Press on Tuesday. His death was announced Monday over the school's public address system, and a moment of silence was observed, she said. Courneya's mother, Wendy Thompson, said his wife, Jennifer, called family members Saturday night to tell them he had been killed. Thompson said her husband, Army Spc. David Thompson, was in Iraq and returning home after learning of his stepson's death. If all three soldiers now missing were taken alive, it would be the biggest single abduction of U.S. soldiers in Iraq since March 23, 2003, when Pvt. Jessica Lynch and six others were captured in an ambush near Nasiriyah that also left 11 Americans dead. The 2nd Brigade Combat Team is in the 10th month of a 15-month tour in Iraq. The brigade was also deployed to Iraq in 2005. The 10th Mountain Division made its reputation in World War II, when soldiers scaled a sheer, 1,500-foot cliff under cover of darkness and fought their way through the snowy mountains of northern Italy in 1945. That spearheaded the drive that would liberate the country from the Nazis. The 10th Mountain was the Army's most frequently deployed division during the 1990s, serving in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere. The division's members became the first regular U.S. ground troops to be sent to Central Asia as part of American's response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Its soldiers provided security for U.S. Air Force fighter and combat search-and-rescue teams in Uzbekistan.

News Missing soldiers from Fort Drum FORT DRUM, N.Y. - The seven American victims of a weekend ambush in were members of the storied 10th Mountain Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Army officials in Iraq said Tuesday. The attack near Mahmoudiya, in a Sunni stronghold 20 miles south of Baghdad, left four U.S. soldiers and an Iraqi translator dead, and three other soldiers missing. acknowledged for the first time that it believes the missing soldiers are in terrorist hands. The Islamic State of Iraq &#151; an al-Qaida front group that has claimed to have captured the soldiers &#151; has warned the U.S. to stop its massive search for the missing. Military officials would not release the names of the soldiers until their families were notified but confirmed they were assigned to Company D, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, nicknamed the "Polar Bears," said Lt. Col. Paul Fitzpatrick, a Fort Drum spokesman. All the missing soldiers are men, Fitzpatrick said. "It's been the unfortunate experience that soldiers who have been captured have not all turned out well. We are hoping this turns out to be an exception," he said. The 10th Mountain Division has a reputation for success that dates to World War II. Ready to go anywhere in the world within 48 hours, the 10th Mountain is trained to fight in steamy jungles, sandy deserts, cities and, of course, mountains. Families of the soldiers released the names of two of the dead on Monday &#151; Sgt. 1st Class James David Connell Jr., 40, of Lake City, Tenn., and Pfc. Daniel Courneya, 19, of Vermontville, Mich.

News Search on in S.C. for missing officer By BRUCE SMITH, Associated Press Writer LADSON, S.C. - Dozens of police officers and bloodhounds searched for a missing constable Tuesday after his empty cruiser was found in flames several miles from where he was last seen at a traffic stop, authorities said. Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said authorities had identified a "person of interest" who was being sought on an unrelated weapons charge. But he said officials don't know what happened to Robert Lee Bailey, a 66-year-old constable who works for the Lincolnville Police Department. "It certainly does not look good. But we are hopeful. We have no explanation for what occurred," Cannon said. He said the shooting was not believed to be related to the traffic stop. Bailey was last seen when he pulled a vehicle over about 10:30 p.m. Monday in Lincolnville. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots a few minutes later, and Bailey's cap, two guns, bullet casings and blood were found in a yard. About an hour later, a Highway Patrol officer spotted Bailey's burning car in the parking lot of a church off Interstate 26. Cannon said officials wanted to speak to a 24-year-old man wanted on a federal weapons charge. Walter Fayall, of St. Stephens, was being sought by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. No charges had been filed against him in the missing officer case. Authorities also issued an alert for a black Chevrolet Caprice. Along highways near Lincolnville, a small town about 20 miles west of Charleston, electronic signs listed a fugitive alert. Gary Tucker, data analyst for Faith Assembly of God Church, saw the charred remains of the cruiser early Tuesday. "I just noticed it was a police car and it was torched. And the back window was smashed out," he said. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division sent agents to help in the investigation, spokeswoman Kathryn Richardson said. Constables assist law enforcement agencies and may carry firearms. They must complete a basic training course at a state technical college before they can be appointed by the governor.

News Shuttle rolls back out to launch pad By MIKE SCHNEIDER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 12:05 PM ET CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - After 2 1/2 months of repairs to its external fuel tank, space shuttle Atlantis returned to the launch pad Tuesday in anticipation of an early June liftoff to the international space station. The 3.4-mile, early-morning trip aboard the massive crawler-transporter took under seven hours from when the shuttle left the Vehicle Assembly Building to when it was secured at the launch pad. The last time Atlantis made that trip was in February. The shuttle was on its launch pad when a freak hail storm swept through and pounded fuel tank with golf ball-sized hail that left thousands of dings in the tank's insulating foam. managers postponed a planned mid-March launch and ordered the shuttle returned to the Vehicle Assembly Building for repairs. Technicians sprayed on new insulation foam in some areas, hand-poured foam on other areas and sanded down spots. When the shuttle rolled out Tuesday, the orange tank had hundreds of white speckles at the top showing their work. The launch is now planned for no earlier than June 8. A final decision will be made at the end of the month. "It's a real success story &#151; almost bordering on an Apollo 13 type story to develop that in such a short time," John Chapman, NASA's manager of the external tank project, said last week, referring to the engineering ingenuity that delivered the moon-bound crew safely back to Earth in 1970 after an oxygen tank ruptured on the spacecraft. Foam debris coming off the external fuel tank has been of special concern to NASA since the seven astronauts aboard Columbia perished when a piece of foam from the tank struck a wing during launch, allowing fiery gases to penetrate the space shuttle while returning to Earth. Astronaut Clayton Anderson has been added to the previously six-man Atlantis crew so he can replace U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams on the international space station. Until the shuttle arrives, Williams and her colleagues at the space station will make do with 2 1/2 tons of fuel, air, water and other supplies that were delivered Tuesday by a Russian cargo vehicle. NASA managers hope Atlantis' launch puts the space agency back on a regular schedule of shuttle missions after a five-month hiatus. The last space shuttle flight was in December, and three more missions are scheduled for this year after Atlantis. The space agency has at least 14 more missions to finish building the space station and repair the before the shuttle fleet is grounded in 2010. The next-generation spacecraft, Orion, isn't scheduled to fly astronauts until 2015. Last week, leaders of almost two dozen aerospace companies sent a letter to members of Congress urging them to support funding NASA an additional $1.4 billion above the administration's 2008 budget request of $17.3 billion to narrow the gap when the United States won't have manned spaceflights.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/border_biometrics	AP IMPACT: Laser visas are rarely used - Yahoo! News AP IMPACT: Laser visas are rarely used By ELLIOT SPAGAT, Associated Press Writer SAN DIEGO - The face- and fingerprint-matching technology that has been touted over the past decade as a sophisticated new way to stop terrorists and illegal immigrants from entering the country through Mexico has one major drawback: U.S. border inspectors almost never use it. In fact, the necessary equipment is not even installed in vehicle lanes along the border. Government officials told The Associated Press that checking more people would create too big a backup at the border, where hours-long traffic jams are already common. Some members of Congress who voted for the system in 1996 are complaining they were misled. They said the intent was to use biometrics &#151; or a person's unique physical traits &#151; to screen everyone. "Congress would not have gone to the trouble of requiring biometric features on the border crossing card if it knew the administration would not require that those features be read by scanners," said Rep. Lamar Smith ( ), R-Texas, who wrote the legislation. The U.S. government has spent tens of millions of dollars issuing visa cards digitally embedded with the holder's photo and fingerprints. Holders of the cards come across the border tens of millions of times each year. But on average, in only about 2 percent of those cases are the cardholders screened with the biometric technology to verify their identities and check law-enforcement records, said Paul Morris, Customs and Border Protection's executive director of admissibility requirements and migration control. The checks are done consistently only on the small portion of cardholders who seek permission to travel beyond the border region. "As the technology becomes available, we can expand the current level of biometric matching," Morris said. "There is not a technology solution currently available that will not cause delays that are well beyond the acceptable levels." Beginning in 1998, the high-tech "laser visas" have been issued to 9.1 million Mexicans for short visits to the United States. The laser visas, which look like driver's licenses, have a 1.4-inch optical memory stripe holding personal information such as name, gender and birth date. The stripe also stores the owner's digitized facial photo and two fingerprints. Cardholders coming across the border may be asked to press their fingers against a glass and pose for a photo, while their card pulls up their biometric file &#151; a process that takes an extra 30 seconds or so per person. The photo and fingerprints can also be instantly checked against criminal and terrorist watch lists. The laser visas entitle Mexicans to travel 25 miles from the border &#151; slightly farther in Arizona &#151; for 30 days. Cardholders can also apply for a permit to travel anywhere in the U.S. for up to six months. Border inspectors routinely swipe the laser visas through a machine to retrieve the basic personal information and to call up a photo. But, with some exceptions, the inspectors use the facial- and fingerprint-matching technology only for those applying at the border for one of the six-month permits, Morris said. That practice means that most of those who are checked are not selected at random; they know they are going to be scanned when they come across. The government contract for laser visas was worth $28.6 million from 2000 to 2006, and awarded a five-year renewal in March to General Dynamics Corp. worth $28.5 million, according to Homeland Security. That price tag excludes the cost of opening new consulates to handle the rush of applicants. The State Department established consulates across the border from Laredo, Texas, and Nogales, Ariz. In Tijuana, Mexico, the consulate took over an old gymnasium across town. The 1996 law said anyone presenting a border crossing card "is not permitted to cross over the border into the U.S. unless the biometric identifier contained on the card matches the appropriate biometric characteristics of the alien." But Sandra Raynes, consular officer at the U.S. consulate in Tijuana, said: "If they were to check everyone, you'd have lines all the way down to Cabo San Lucas," about 1,100 miles south of San Diego. U.S. officials said biometrics are only part of its effort to stem illegal crossings. An inspector's wits and agency intelligence are also key, they said. Biometrics "is one tool in our toolbox," said Kelly Klundt, a Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman. Also, the laminated cards have reduced fraud because they are difficult to counterfeit, officials said. Older visas looked like crumpled library cards, some dating to the 1950s. Authorities said women in their 60s used cards with photographs of teenage girls because the cards had no expiration dates. Former Rep. Jim Kolbe, a Republican who left Congress in January after 22 years representing a district on the Arizona border, said lawmakers expected checks on all cardholders, though there was no timetable. "We definitely intended to go further with it than we have," he said. "Ten years later, it seems incredible that we've only gotten this far with it." The 14 pedestrian booths at San Ysidro, the nation's busiest border crossing by far, are equipped with fingerprint glass but no cameras. But that glass is not used on the 30,000 people who walk though daily. There is neither type of equipment in the 24 vehicle lanes, which handle about 35,000 cars and 250 buses a day. Applicants for the six-month permits are asked to pull aside into a small parking lot, get out and walk up to a booth, where they are fingerprinted and photographed for verification. Initially, border crossings did not even have equipment to lift personal information off the cards, let alone the biometric data. Jeffrey Davidow, U.S. ambassador to Mexico from 1998 to 2001, recalls members of Congress visiting the border to see the machines, which were never used when the lawmakers were gone. "I'd tell them that it was all show, that it doesn't work, that the card is not doing what it's supposed to do," Davidow said. He said his warnings elicited shrugs. There were also technological setbacks. Equipment to verify photos and fingerprints often failed to read through sweat, scratches and other wallet "crud," according to an internal Homeland Security report. A test at five Texas crossings in the spring of 2004 showed that 731 out of 1,740 cards, or 42 percent, were unreadable, according to the report, which was provided to The Associated Press by someone who insisted on anonymity because the government did not authorize its release. Homeland Security officials did not have more recent figures on how many cards are correctly read. But they said technical problems have been resolved.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/border_biometrics	AP IMPACT: Laser visas are rarely used - Yahoo! News AP IMPACT: Laser visas are rarely used By ELLIOT SPAGAT, Associated Press Writer SAN DIEGO - The face- and fingerprint-matching technology that has been touted over the past decade as a sophisticated new way to stop terrorists and illegal immigrants from entering the country through Mexico has one major drawback: U.S. border inspectors almost never use it. In fact, the necessary equipment is not even installed in vehicle lanes along the border. Government officials told The Associated Press that checking more people would create too big a backup at the border, where hours-long traffic jams are already common. Some members of Congress who voted for the system in 1996 are complaining they were misled. They said the intent was to use biometrics &#151; or a person's unique physical traits &#151; to screen everyone. "Congress would not have gone to the trouble of requiring biometric features on the border crossing card if it knew the administration would not require that those features be read by scanners," said Rep. Lamar Smith ( ), R-Texas, who wrote the legislation. The U.S. government has spent tens of millions of dollars issuing visa cards digitally embedded with the holder's photo and fingerprints. Holders of the cards come across the border tens of millions of times each year. But on average, in only about 2 percent of those cases are the cardholders screened with the biometric technology to verify their identities and check law-enforcement records, said Paul Morris, Customs and Border Protection's executive director of admissibility requirements and migration control. The checks are done consistently only on the small portion of cardholders who seek permission to travel beyond the border region. "As the technology becomes available, we can expand the current level of biometric matching," Morris said. "There is not a technology solution currently available that will not cause delays that are well beyond the acceptable levels." Beginning in 1998, the high-tech "laser visas" have been issued to 9.1 million Mexicans for short visits to the United States. The laser visas, which look like driver's licenses, have a 1.4-inch optical memory stripe holding personal information such as name, gender and birth date. The stripe also stores the owner's digitized facial photo and two fingerprints. Cardholders coming across the border may be asked to press their fingers against a glass and pose for a photo, while their card pulls up their biometric file &#151; a process that takes an extra 30 seconds or so per person. The photo and fingerprints can also be instantly checked against criminal and terrorist watch lists. The laser visas entitle Mexicans to travel 25 miles from the border &#151; slightly farther in Arizona &#151; for 30 days. Cardholders can also apply for a permit to travel anywhere in the U.S. for up to six months. Border inspectors routinely swipe the laser visas through a machine to retrieve the basic personal information and to call up a photo. But, with some exceptions, the inspectors use the facial- and fingerprint-matching technology only for those applying at the border for one of the six-month permits, Morris said. That practice means that most of those who are checked are not selected at random; they know they are going to be scanned when they come across. The government contract for laser visas was worth $28.6 million from 2000 to 2006, and awarded a five-year renewal in March to General Dynamics Corp. worth $28.5 million, according to Homeland Security. That price tag excludes the cost of opening new consulates to handle the rush of applicants. The State Department established consulates across the border from Laredo, Texas, and Nogales, Ariz. In Tijuana, Mexico, the consulate took over an old gymnasium across town. The 1996 law said anyone presenting a border crossing card "is not permitted to cross over the border into the U.S. unless the biometric identifier contained on the card matches the appropriate biometric characteristics of the alien." But Sandra Raynes, consular officer at the U.S. consulate in Tijuana, said: "If they were to check everyone, you'd have lines all the way down to Cabo San Lucas," about 1,100 miles south of San Diego. U.S. officials said biometrics are only part of its effort to stem illegal crossings. An inspector's wits and agency intelligence are also key, they said. Biometrics "is one tool in our toolbox," said Kelly Klundt, a Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman. Also, the laminated cards have reduced fraud because they are difficult to counterfeit, officials said. Older visas looked like crumpled library cards, some dating to the 1950s. Authorities said women in their 60s used cards with photographs of teenage girls because the cards had no expiration dates. Former Rep. Jim Kolbe, a Republican who left Congress in January after 22 years representing a district on the Arizona border, said lawmakers expected checks on all cardholders, though there was no timetable. "We definitely intended to go further with it than we have," he said. "Ten years later, it seems incredible that we've only gotten this far with it." The 14 pedestrian booths at San Ysidro, the nation's busiest border crossing by far, are equipped with fingerprint glass but no cameras. But that glass is not used on the 30,000 people who walk though daily. There is neither type of equipment in the 24 vehicle lanes, which handle about 35,000 cars and 250 buses a day. Applicants for the six-month permits are asked to pull aside into a small parking lot, get out and walk up to a booth, where they are fingerprinted and photographed for verification. Initially, border crossings did not even have equipment to lift personal information off the cards, let alone the biometric data. Jeffrey Davidow, U.S. ambassador to Mexico from 1998 to 2001, recalls members of Congress visiting the border to see the machines, which were never used when the lawmakers were gone. "I'd tell them that it was all show, that it doesn't work, that the card is not doing what it's supposed to do," Davidow said. He said his warnings elicited shrugs. There were also technological setbacks. Equipment to verify photos and fingerprints often failed to read through sweat, scratches and other wallet "crud," according to an internal Homeland Security report. A test at five Texas crossings in the spring of 2004 showed that 731 out of 1,740 cards, or 42 percent, were unreadable, according to the report, which was provided to The Associated Press by someone who insisted on anonymity because the government did not authorize its release. Homeland Security officials did not have more recent figures on how many cards are correctly read. But they said technical problems have been resolved.

News Extremist taunts his victims from prison By JAY REEVES, Associated Press Writer Mon May 14, 11:28 PM ET BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - Victims of Eric Rudolph, the anti-abortion extremist who pulled off a series of bombings across the South, say he is taunting them from deep within the nation's most secure federal prison, and authorities say there is little they can do to stop him. Rudolph, who was captured after a five-year manhunt and pleaded guilty in deadly bombings at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and a Birmingham abortion clinic, is serving life in prison at the "Supermax" penitentiary in Florence, Colo. Housed in the most secure part of the prison, he has no computer and little contact with the outside world aside from writing letters. But Rudolph's long essays have been posted on the Internet by a supporter who maintains an Army of God Web site. The Army of God is the same loose-knit group that Rudolph claimed to represent in letters sent after the blasts. In one piece, Rudolph seeks to justify violence against abortion clinics by arguing that Jesus would condone "militant action in defense of the innocent." In another essay about his sentencing, Rudolph mocks former abortion clinic nurse Emily Lyons, who was nearly killed in the 1998 bombing in Birmingham, and her husband, Jeff. He uses pseudonyms rather than naming the couple, but there is no doubt he is describing them. Rudolph recalls how Emily Lyons, in court, described the pain of her injuries and made an obscene gesture at Rudolph as she showed off a finger mangled by the blast. Rudolph writes: "It was a great speech and one that the denizens of freedom should be proud to enshrine in a museum somewhere. Perhaps they could put it next to MLKs `I Have a Dream.' They could call it `I Have a Middle Finger.'" Jeff Lyons said he doesn't often look at the Web site, which has had some items posted for nearly two years. But he said he is worried that Rudolph's messages could incite someone to violence against abortion providers. "He's still sending out harassing communication. He's still hurting us," Lyons said. Diane Derzis, who owns the Birmingham clinic that was bombed, killing a police officer, said someone should stop Rudolph. Bureau of Prisons regulations give wardens the right to reject correspondence by an inmate for "the protection of the public, or if it might facilitate criminal activity." That includes material "which may lead to the use of physical violence." The Bureau of Prisons failed to respond to repeated inquiries from The Associated Press about whether Rudolph's writings violate prison rules. But U.S. Attorney Alice Martin, who helped prosecute Rudolph for the Alabama bombing, said there is nothing the prison can do to restrict Rudolph or the supporter who keeps posting his writings, anti-abortion activist Donald Spitz of Chesapeake, Va. "An inmate does not lose his freedom of speech," she said. Spitz said he corresponds regularly with Rudolph and posts some of his essays because of their shared desire to end abortion. As for those who might be offended, he said, "They don't have to look at it on the Web site." John Hawthorne, whose wife, Alice, was killed in the Olympic bombing, said he isn't bothered by Rudolph's essays. "As far as I'm concerned he's out of sight, out of mind," Hawthorne said. "I don't mind him saying whatever he's going to say as long as they keep him locked up." Supermax has a capacity of 490 and holds some of the nation's most infamous inmates, including Unabomber Theodore Kaczyinski and Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui. A Justice Department report last fall criticized the prison for not properly screening inmate mail. It determined that three men convicted in the World Trade Center bombing were able to send dozens of letters overseas to suspected terrorists. Texas youth prisons suspends 4 more AP via Yahoo!

News UT-Austin fires financial aid chief By LIZ AUSTIN PETERSON, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 10:44 AM ET AUSTIN, Texas - The University of Texas at Austin fired its financial aid director after determining he had owned stock in a loan company in violation of university rules. Associate Vice President Lawrence Burt has been on paid leave since early last month, when he was named in a New York attorney general's investigation into the $85 billion student loan industry. Burt has denied wrongdoing. He did not return a telephone call seeking comment after his firing Monday. A University of Texas System investigation found that Burt placed a subsidiary of the loan company at the top of several preferred lender lists without any apparent justification. The subsidiary, Student Loan Xpress, trailed many other companies in volume, customer service and default rates, the investigation found. But it was among the lenders that offered the most benefits to financial aid staff, including happy hours. Burt owned 2,300 shares in Education Lending Group Inc., the former parent company of Student Loan Xpress, the investigation by UT System General Counsel Barry Burgdorf found. That includes 1,500 shares he bought from a friend shortly before adding the lender to the preferred list. Burgdorf found no direct evidence that Burt accepted the stock in exchange for adding Student Loan Xpress to the list. "Nevertheless, the timing of the transaction in relation to Student Loan Xpress' inclusion on ... lender lists raises suspicion and, at least, creates the appearance of impropriety," Burgdorf said in his report. Burt should have sold the stock or at least disclosed that he owned it and recused himself from any decisions about Student Loan Xpress, Burgdorf said. Burt sold the stock in 2005 for at least $18,000. When the investigation began last month, Burt said his previous ownership of the shares had no connection to Student Loan Xpress's position on the preferred lender list. "They are on our lender list for the same reason the other 19 are on the list. They provide the best package of benefits to students," he said. Burgdorf said the preferred lender list was flawed because Burt alone had the authority to add or remove companies and he often did so with little or no explanation. He recommended that the university establish objective criteria for the list and that managers be required to disclose their relationships with any entities involved in the student lending industry. Charles A. Sorber, former president of the University of Texas of the Permian Basin, was named interim director of the financial aid office starting May 29.

News Arson squad probes 6 Newport, RI, fires Tue May 15, 8:50 AM ET NEWPORT, R.I. - An arson task force is investigating a string of six fires that have broken out in the city since May, three of them in just the past week. On Sunday, fires that started within a few hours of each other damaged two century-old homes, one of them a Victorian house that had been converted into apartments. A few days earlier, a fire destroyed a downtown souvenir shop. "We're asking the public to be very vigilant," police Captain Wayne Morrison said. "Any and all information could be useful, even if people think it's trivial." The task force, which includes members of the city's police and fire departments, the state Fire Marshal's Office and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, is looking into six fires dating to a March 5 blaze in a mixed-use building. "We're all apprehensive," said Federico Santi, who owns an antiques business, The Drawing Room of Newport. "We're wondering, 'Am I going to go to bed and wake up with a fireman breaking down the door?'" Newport, a city of about 25,000 residents, is known for its colonial heritage and Gilded Age mansions. It is bordered by Rhode Island Sound and Narragansett Bay.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/student_loan_probe_texas	UT-Austin fires financial aid chief - Yahoo! News UT-Austin fires financial aid chief By LIZ AUSTIN PETERSON, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 10:44 AM ET AUSTIN, Texas - The University of Texas at Austin fired its financial aid director after determining he had owned stock in a loan company in violation of university rules. Associate Vice President Lawrence Burt has been on paid leave since early last month, when he was named in a New York attorney general's investigation into the $85 billion student loan industry. Burt has denied wrongdoing. He did not return a telephone call seeking comment after his firing Monday. A University of Texas System investigation found that Burt placed a subsidiary of the loan company at the top of several preferred lender lists without any apparent justification. The subsidiary, Student Loan Xpress, trailed many other companies in volume, customer service and default rates, the investigation found. But it was among the lenders that offered the most benefits to financial aid staff, including happy hours. Burt owned 2,300 shares in Education Lending Group Inc., the former parent company of Student Loan Xpress, the investigation by UT System General Counsel Barry Burgdorf found. That includes 1,500 shares he bought from a friend shortly before adding the lender to the preferred list. Burgdorf found no direct evidence that Burt accepted the stock in exchange for adding Student Loan Xpress to the list. "Nevertheless, the timing of the transaction in relation to Student Loan Xpress' inclusion on ... lender lists raises suspicion and, at least, creates the appearance of impropriety," Burgdorf said in his report. Burt should have sold the stock or at least disclosed that he owned it and recused himself from any decisions about Student Loan Xpress, Burgdorf said. Burt sold the stock in 2005 for at least $18,000. When the investigation began last month, Burt said his previous ownership of the shares had no connection to Student Loan Xpress's position on the preferred lender list. "They are on our lender list for the same reason the other 19 are on the list. They provide the best package of benefits to students," he said. Burgdorf said the preferred lender list was flawed because Burt alone had the authority to add or remove companies and he often did so with little or no explanation. He recommended that the university establish objective criteria for the list and that managers be required to disclose their relationships with any entities involved in the student lending industry. Charles A. Sorber, former president of the University of Texas of the Permian Basin, was named interim director of the financial aid office starting May 29.

News Cruise ship runs aground off Alaska By ANNE SUTTON, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 5:11 AM ET JUNEAU, Alaska - When the Empress of the North ran aground, the band played on &#151; as everyone disembarked in a safe and orderly fashion. Passengers jolted awake by the ship hitting a charted reef 50 miles southwest of Juneau early Monday were ordered to don lifejackets and gather in the ballroom, where a singer and piano player entertained them with songs including "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" as they waited for rescue. Passengers praised the ship's crew for taking charge. "They just seemed to know what they were doing. They were caring, courteous, the whole thing, and I think that's what kept everybody calm," said Mary Crosby, 83, of Seattle. National Transportation Safety Board National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the grounding of the riverboat-style cruise ship, which had 206 passengers and 75 crew members on board. One person was taken to a hospital for observation, a Juneau city official said. When Coast Guard helicopters reached the area, the vessel was listing at the southern end of Icy Strait and had begun taking on water, the Coast Guard said. As the ship's pumps worked to remove the water, the passengers were transferred safely to other boats in the area and then to an Alaska state ferry to be taken to Juneau. The Empress of the North floated free of the rock during the evacuation, and the crew was able to stabilize the ship, said the Coast Guard. The ship arrived in Juneau with a Coast Guard escort about nine hours after the grounding. The ferry Columbia arrived shortly after. State officials said the hull sustained significant damage and an empty fuel tank was breached during the grounding. A light oil sheen was seen in the area but officials were uncertain if the ship was the source. Coast Guard Petty Officer Barry Lane said Coast Guard inspectors did an initial survey of the ship as it was moored in Juneau's Auke Bay and will pass the information on to the NTSB. It wasn't immediately clear why the cruise ship ran aground, said Coast Guard officials. It was drizzling in Juneau but the seas were calm. Good Samaritans were first on the scene of the grounding and passengers were initially evacuated onto lifeboats, a charter fishing boat, a tugboat, another small cruise ship and a coast guard cutter before the Columbia arrived. "The morning was incredible. You had anybody and everybody that could get there and they all got there as quick as they could and all were willing to help out," said Coast Guard Capt. Mark Guillory, federal on-scene coordinator. Passengers left the ship with only their personal identification and medications. They were to be reunited with their belongings later in Juneau. All had been flown to Seattle by evening, said company officials. "It couldn't have been better orchestrated the way things fell into place," said Chief Petty Officer Barry Lane. The Empress of the North is operated by Majestic America Line of Seattle. The ship has 112 staterooms, a three-story paddlewheel and galleries featuring Native American masks and Russian artwork, including Faberge eggs, according to its Web site. The 360-foot ship is less than half the size of the average cruise ship in the Caribbean, and is also dwarfed by most cruise other ships off the Alaska coast. The grounding occurred on the second day of a seven-day cruise, said Dan Miller, a spokesman for Majestic America. The American-built ship is billed by the company as the only overnight paddlewheel vessel in use on Alaska cruises. It also is used on cruises on the Columbia River between Washington state and Oregon. The Empress of the North has had other problems since it began operating in mid-2003. In October of that year, it hit a navigation lock on the Snake River in Washington. It has also run aground at least twice before &#151; once after developing steering problems on the Columbia River, and once on a sandbar near Washougal, Wash., as it tried to avoid a barge.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/jerry_falwell	TV evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 - Yahoo! News TV evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 By SUE LINDSEY, Associated Press Writer LYNCHBURG, Va. - The Rev. Jerry Falwell, the folksy, small-town preacher who used the power of television to found the Moral Majority and turn the Christian right into a mighty force in American politics during the Reagan years, died Tuesday at 73. Falwell was discovered without a pulse in his office at Liberty University and pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later. Dr. Carl Moore, Falwell's physician, said he had a heart condition and presumably died of a heart rhythm abnormality. Driven into politics by the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that established the right to an abortion, Falwell founded the Moral Majority in 1979. One of the conservative lobbying group's greatest triumphs came just a year later, when Falwell credited the Moral Majority with getting millions of conservative voters registered, aiding in Reagan's victory and giving Republicans control of the Senate. "I shudder to think where the country would be right now if the religious right had not evolved," he said when he stepped down as Moral Majority president in 1987. Fellow TV evangelist Pat Robertson, himself a one-time GOP candidate for president, declared Falwell "a tower of strength on many of the moral issues which have confronted our nation." The rise of Christian conservatism &#151; and the Moral Majority's full-throated condemnation of homosexuality, abortion and pornography &#151; made Falwell perhaps the most recognizable figure on the evangelical right, and one of the most controversial ones, too. Over the years, Falwell waged a landmark libel case against Hustler magazine founder Larry Flynt over a raunchy parody ad, and created a furor in 1999 when one of his publications suggested that the purse-carrying "Teletubbies" character Tinky Winky was gay. Matt Foreman, executive director of National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, extended condolences to those close to Falwell, but added: "Unfortunately, we will always remember him as a founder and leader of America's anti-gay industry, someone who exacerbated the nation's appalling response to the onslaught of the epidemic, someone who demonized and vilified us for political gain and someone who used religion to divide rather than unite our nation." The 1980s marked the religious conservative movement's high-water mark. In more recent years, Falwell had become a problematic figure for the GOP. His remarks a few days after Sept. 11, 2001, essentially blaming feminists, gays and liberals for bringing on the terrorist attacks drew a rebuke from the White House, and he apologized. Falwell's declining political star seemed apparent when he quietly led in and out of the Republican Party's 2004 national convention. Just four years earlier, he was invited to pray from the rostrum. The big, blue-eyed preacher with a booming voice started a fundamentalist church in an abandoned bottling plant in Lynchburg in 1956 with just 35 members. He built it into a religious empire that included the 22,000-member Thomas Road Baptist Church, the "Old Time Gospel Hour" carried on TV stations around the country and 7,700-student Liberty University, which Falwell founded in 1971 as Lynchburg Baptist College. From his living room, he broadcast his message of salvation and raised the donations that helped his ministry grow. "He was one of the first to come up with ways to use television to expand his ministry," said Robert Alley, a retired University of Richmond religion professor who studied and criticized Falwell's career. Falwell had once opposed mixing preaching with politics, but changed his views. The Moral Majority grew to 6.5 million members and raised $69 million as it supported conservative politicians and railed against abortion, homosexuality, pornography and bans on school prayer. Falwell became the face of the religious right, appearing on national magazine covers and on talk shows. In 1983, U.S. News & World Report named him one of 25 most influential people in America. "Dr. Falwell was a man of distinguished accomplishment who devoted his life to serving his faith and country," said Sen. John McCain ( ), a GOP presidential contender who during the 2000 primaries referred to Falwell and Robertson as "agents of intolerance." McCain has since distanced himself from those comments. In 1984, Falwell sued Hustler for $45 million, charging that he was libeled by an liquor-ad parody that quoted him as saying he lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse. A federal jury found the fake ad did not libel him, but awarded him $200,000 for emotional distress. The verdict was overturned in a landmark 1988 decision that held that even pornographic spoofs about a public figure enjoy First Amendment protection. With Falwell's high profile came frequent criticism, even from fellow ministers. The Rev. Billy Graham once rebuked him for political sermonizing on "non-moral issues." Falwell quit the Moral Majority in 1987, saying he was tired of being "a lightning rod" and wanted to devote his time to his ministry and Liberty University. But he remained outspoken and continued to draw criticism for his remarks. In 1999, he told an evangelical conference that the Antichrist was a male Jew who was probably already alive. Falwell later apologized for the remark but not for holding the belief. A month later, his National Liberty Journal warned parents that Tinky Winky, the children's TV character, was a gay role model and morally damaging to children. Falwell was re-energized after family values proved important in the 2004 presidential election. He formed the Faith and Values Coalition as the "21st Century resurrection of the Moral Majority," to seek anti-abortion judges, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and more conservative elected officials. In 1987, Falwell took over the PTL (Praise the Lord) ministry in South Carolina after the Rev. Jim Bakker got caught in a sex and money scandal. Falwell slid fully clothed down a theme park water slide after donors met his fundraising goal to help rescue the rival ministry. He gave it up seven months later after learning the depth of PTL's financial problems. Largely because of the sex scandals involving Bakker and fellow evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, donations to Falwell's ministry dropped from $135 million in 1986 to less than $100 million the following year. Hundreds of workers were laid off and viewers of his television show dwindled. Liberty University was $73 million in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy, and his "Old Time Gospel Hour" was $16 million in debt. By the mid-1990s, two local businessmen with long ties to Falwell began overseeing the finances and helped get companies to forgive debts or write them off. Falwell dreamed that Liberty would grow to 50,000 students and be to fundamentalist Christians what Notre Dame is to Roman Catholics and Brigham Young University is to Mormons. Falwell's father and his grandfather were militant atheists, he wrote in his autobiography. He said his father made a fortune off his businesses &#151; including bootlegging during Prohibition. As a student, Falwell was a star athlete and a prankster who was barred from giving his high school valedictorian's speech after he was caught using counterfeit lunch tickets. He ran with a gang of juvenile delinquents before becoming a born-again Christian at 19. He turned down an offer to play professional baseball and transferred from Lynchburg College to Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Mo. "My heart was burning to serve Christ," he once said in an interview. "I knew nothing would ever be the same again." Falwell had made careful preparations for a transition of his leadership to his two sons, Jerry Falwell, Jr., now vice chancellor of Liberty University, and Jonathan Falwell, executive the pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church. Falwell is survived by his wife, Macel, his two sons and a daughter, Jeannie Falwell Savas. Funeral arrangements were not immediately known. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Mormon whose own faith has become an issue during his run for the presidency, said Falwell "built and led a movement based on strong principles and strong faith," and "the legacy of his important work will continue through his many ministries where he put his faith into action."

News Groups: Block Texas town's immigrant ban By ANABELLE GARAY, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 42 minutes ago DALLAS - Latino activists and civil liberties advocates asked a federal judge Tuesday to block a voter-approved ordinance that prohibits landlords from renting apartments to most illegal immigrants in the Dallas suburb of Farmers Branch. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union American Civil Liberties Union , which have already sued the city, requested the temporary restraining order in U.S. District Court. The ordinance, scheduled to take effect next Tuesday, requires apartment managers to verify that renters are U.S. citizens or legal immigrants before leasing to them, with some exceptions. Violators face fines of up to $500. "It is unfortunate that the residents of Farmers Branch have chosen to implement a law which is not only bad policy, but is likely also unconstitutional," said Lisa Graybill, legal director for the ACLU of Texas. "Now the issue will have to be resolved in federal court." The city is preparing a response to the request, said Matthew Boyle, an attorney representing Farmers Branch. City council members first approved the ban in November without discussion, then revised it in January to include exemptions for minors, seniors and some mixed-status families. On Saturday, residents voted to approve the ban with 68 percent of voters in favor, according to unofficial results. Councilman Tim O'Hare, the ordinance's lead proponent, contends the city's economy and quality of life will improve if illegal immigrants are kept out. O'Hare declined to comment Tuesday. Since 1970, Farmers Branch has changed from a small, predominantly white bedroom community with a declining population to a city of almost 28,000 people, about 37 percent of them Hispanic, according to the U.S. Farmers Branch already faces four lawsuits brought by civil rights groups, residents, property owners and businesses, who say the ordinance discriminates and puts landlords in the precarious position of acting as federal immigration officers. Their attorneys argue the ordinance attempts to regulate immigration, a duty that is exclusively the federal government's. Nationwide, more than 90 local governments have proposed, passed or rejected laws prohibiting landlords from leasing to illegal immigrants, penalizing businesses that employ them or training police to enforce immigration laws.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/swept_away	Child, teen swept away by Colo. flooding - Yahoo! News Child, teen swept away by Colo. flooding 1 hour, 56 minutes ago DENVER - Severe thunderstorms sent normally placid streams over their banks across the Denver area, sweeping away a 2-year-old boy in a stroller and a teenager who was trying to help with a rescue. Both were still missing Tuesday, police said. The toddler's mother had been out for a stroll Monday along a bike path that follows a creek near downtown. It had been a sunny morning, and the thunderstorm developed quickly. In less than an hour, it dumped more than an inch of rain, flooding streets and sending a torrent of water down the tiny creek. The woman sought refuge under a bridge as hail started to fall but realized she needed to leave the path, Denver Fire Department spokesman Phil Champagne said. "Once you enter (the bike path), you're in a chute," Champagne said. "She knew she was in trouble and was trying to get out. She was on the phone with her grandfather, trying to figure out a way out. "The water knocked her down, she was dragged for a little bit and was unable to hold onto the stroller," Champagne said. "What a tragic event. That poor mother to see her child swept away like that." Firefighters struggled against the current to rescue the woman, but her son and stroller were swept downstream. The stroller was later found empty more than a mile away in the South Platte River, Champagne said. Firefighters sent two divers to reach the mother as she clung to a concrete embankment. When she realized firefighters did not her son, she apparently released her grip and drifted downstream, where other firefighters pulled her from the water, Champagne said. In south Denver, a police officer and firefighters were able to save one teenager from a swollen creek in a park, but another teen who apparently was trying to help was swept away and remained missing, Champagne said. Rescuers searched Tuesday for the 2-year-old, believing he could have become stuck in the eddies of the South Platte River. A search for the teen was expected later. The officer was hospitalized with what appeared to be hypothermia, police spokesman John White said. The missing baby's mother was also hospitalized. Their names were not released.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/jerry_falwell	TV evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 - Yahoo! News TV evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 By SUE LINDSEY, Associated Press Writer LYNCHBURG, Va. - The Rev. Jerry Falwell, the folksy, small-town preacher who used the power of television to found the Moral Majority and turn the Christian right into a mighty force in American politics during the Reagan years, died Tuesday at 73. Falwell was discovered without a pulse in his office at Liberty University and pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later. Dr. Carl Moore, Falwell's physician, said he had a heart condition and presumably died of a heart rhythm abnormality. Driven into politics by the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that established the right to an abortion, Falwell founded the Moral Majority in 1979. One of the conservative lobbying group's greatest triumphs came just a year later, when Falwell credited the Moral Majority with getting millions of conservative voters registered, aiding in Reagan's victory and giving Republicans control of the Senate. "I shudder to think where the country would be right now if the religious right had not evolved," he said when he stepped down as Moral Majority president in 1987. Fellow TV evangelist Pat Robertson, himself a one-time GOP candidate for president, declared Falwell "a tower of strength on many of the moral issues which have confronted our nation." The rise of Christian conservatism &#151; and the Moral Majority's full-throated condemnation of homosexuality, abortion and pornography &#151; made Falwell perhaps the most recognizable figure on the evangelical right, and one of the most controversial ones, too. Over the years, Falwell waged a landmark libel case against Hustler magazine founder Larry Flynt over a raunchy parody ad, and created a furor in 1999 when one of his publications suggested that the purse-carrying "Teletubbies" character Tinky Winky was gay. Matt Foreman, executive director of National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, extended condolences to those close to Falwell, but added: "Unfortunately, we will always remember him as a founder and leader of America's anti-gay industry, someone who exacerbated the nation's appalling response to the onslaught of the epidemic, someone who demonized and vilified us for political gain and someone who used religion to divide rather than unite our nation." The 1980s marked the religious conservative movement's high-water mark. In more recent years, Falwell had become a problematic figure for the GOP. His remarks a few days after Sept. 11, 2001, essentially blaming feminists, gays and liberals for bringing on the terrorist attacks drew a rebuke from the White House, and he apologized. Falwell's declining political star seemed apparent when he quietly led in and out of the Republican Party's 2004 national convention. Just four years earlier, he was invited to pray from the rostrum. The big, blue-eyed preacher with a booming voice started a fundamentalist church in an abandoned bottling plant in Lynchburg in 1956 with just 35 members. He built it into a religious empire that included the 22,000-member Thomas Road Baptist Church, the "Old Time Gospel Hour" carried on TV stations around the country and 7,700-student Liberty University, which Falwell founded in 1971 as Lynchburg Baptist College. From his living room, he broadcast his message of salvation and raised the donations that helped his ministry grow. "He was one of the first to come up with ways to use television to expand his ministry," said Robert Alley, a retired University of Richmond religion professor who studied and criticized Falwell's career. Falwell had once opposed mixing preaching with politics, but changed his views. The Moral Majority grew to 6.5 million members and raised $69 million as it supported conservative politicians and railed against abortion, homosexuality, pornography and bans on school prayer. Falwell became the face of the religious right, appearing on national magazine covers and on talk shows. In 1983, U.S. News & World Report named him one of 25 most influential people in America. "Dr. Falwell was a man of distinguished accomplishment who devoted his life to serving his faith and country," said Sen. John McCain ( ), a GOP presidential contender who during the 2000 primaries referred to Falwell and Robertson as "agents of intolerance." McCain has since distanced himself from those comments. In 1984, Falwell sued Hustler for $45 million, charging that he was libeled by an liquor-ad parody that quoted him as saying he lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse. A federal jury found the fake ad did not libel him, but awarded him $200,000 for emotional distress. The verdict was overturned in a landmark 1988 decision that held that even pornographic spoofs about a public figure enjoy First Amendment protection. With Falwell's high profile came frequent criticism, even from fellow ministers. The Rev. Billy Graham once rebuked him for political sermonizing on "non-moral issues." Falwell quit the Moral Majority in 1987, saying he was tired of being "a lightning rod" and wanted to devote his time to his ministry and Liberty University. But he remained outspoken and continued to draw criticism for his remarks. In 1999, he told an evangelical conference that the Antichrist was a male Jew who was probably already alive. Falwell later apologized for the remark but not for holding the belief. A month later, his National Liberty Journal warned parents that Tinky Winky, the children's TV character, was a gay role model and morally damaging to children. Falwell was re-energized after family values proved important in the 2004 presidential election. He formed the Faith and Values Coalition as the "21st Century resurrection of the Moral Majority," to seek anti-abortion judges, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and more conservative elected officials. In 1987, Falwell took over the PTL (Praise the Lord) ministry in South Carolina after the Rev. Jim Bakker got caught in a sex and money scandal. Falwell slid fully clothed down a theme park water slide after donors met his fundraising goal to help rescue the rival ministry. He gave it up seven months later after learning the depth of PTL's financial problems. Largely because of the sex scandals involving Bakker and fellow evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, donations to Falwell's ministry dropped from $135 million in 1986 to less than $100 million the following year. Hundreds of workers were laid off and viewers of his television show dwindled. Liberty University was $73 million in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy, and his "Old Time Gospel Hour" was $16 million in debt. By the mid-1990s, two local businessmen with long ties to Falwell began overseeing the finances and helped get companies to forgive debts or write them off. Falwell dreamed that Liberty would grow to 50,000 students and be to fundamentalist Christians what Notre Dame is to Roman Catholics and Brigham Young University is to Mormons. Falwell's father and his grandfather were militant atheists, he wrote in his autobiography. He said his father made a fortune off his businesses &#151; including bootlegging during Prohibition. As a student, Falwell was a star athlete and a prankster who was barred from giving his high school valedictorian's speech after he was caught using counterfeit lunch tickets. He ran with a gang of juvenile delinquents before becoming a born-again Christian at 19. He turned down an offer to play professional baseball and transferred from Lynchburg College to Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Mo. "My heart was burning to serve Christ," he once said in an interview. "I knew nothing would ever be the same again." Falwell had made careful preparations for a transition of his leadership to his two sons, Jerry Falwell, Jr., now vice chancellor of Liberty University, and Jonathan Falwell, executive the pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church. Falwell is survived by his wife, Macel, his two sons and a daughter, Jeannie Falwell Savas. Funeral arrangements were not immediately known. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Mormon whose own faith has become an issue during his run for the presidency, said Falwell "built and led a movement based on strong principles and strong faith," and "the legacy of his important work will continue through his many ministries where he put his faith into action."

In 1984, Falwell sued Hustler for $45 million, charging that he was libeled by an liquor-ad parody that quoted him as saying he lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse. A federal jury found the fake ad did not libel him, but awarded him $200,000 for emotional distress. The verdict was overturned in a landmark 1988 decision that held that even pornographic spoofs about a public figure enjoy First Amendment protection. With Falwell's high profile came frequent criticism, even from fellow ministers. The Rev. Billy Graham once rebuked him for political sermonizing on "non-moral issues." Falwell quit the Moral Majority in 1987, saying he was tired of being "a lightning rod" and wanted to devote his time to his ministry and Liberty University. But he remained outspoken and continued to draw criticism for his remarks. In 1999, he told an evangelical conference that the Antichrist was a male Jew who was probably already alive. Falwell later apologized for the remark but not for holding the belief. A month later, his National Liberty Journal warned parents that Tinky Winky, the children's TV character, was a gay role model and morally damaging to children. Falwell was re-energized after family values proved important in the 2004 presidential election. He formed the Faith and Values Coalition as the "21st Century resurrection of the Moral Majority," to seek anti-abortion judges, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and more conservative elected officials. In 1987, Falwell took over the PTL (Praise the Lord) ministry in South Carolina after the Rev. Jim Bakker got caught in a sex and money scandal. Falwell slid fully clothed down a theme park water slide after donors met his fundraising goal to help rescue the rival ministry. He gave it up seven months later after learning the depth of PTL's financial problems. Largely because of the sex scandals involving Bakker and fellow evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, donations to Falwell's ministry dropped from $135 million in 1986 to less than $100 million the following year. Hundreds of workers were laid off and viewers of his television show dwindled. Liberty University was $73 million in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy, and his "Old Time Gospel Hour" was $16 million in debt. By the mid-1990s, two local businessmen with long ties to Falwell began overseeing the finances and helped get companies to forgive debts or write them off. Falwell dreamed that Liberty would grow to 50,000 students and be to fundamentalist Christians what Notre Dame is to Roman Catholics and Brigham Young University is to Mormons. Falwell's father and his grandfather were militant atheists, he wrote in his autobiography. He said his father made a fortune off his businesses &#151; including bootlegging during Prohibition. As a student, Falwell was a star athlete and a prankster who was barred from giving his high school valedictorian's speech after he was caught using counterfeit lunch tickets. He ran with a gang of juvenile delinquents before becoming a born-again Christian at 19. He turned down an offer to play professional baseball and transferred from Lynchburg College to Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Mo. "My heart was burning to serve Christ," he once said in an interview. "I knew nothing would ever be the same again." Falwell had made careful preparations for a transition of his leadership to his two sons, Jerry Falwell, Jr., now vice chancellor of Liberty University, and Jonathan Falwell, executive the pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church. Falwell is survived by his wife, Macel, his two sons and a daughter, Jeannie Falwell Savas. Funeral arrangements were not immediately known. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Mormon whose own faith has become an issue during his run for the presidency, said Falwell "built and led a movement based on strong principles and strong faith," and "the legacy of his important work will continue through his many ministries where he put his faith into action."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/gay_marriage	Conn. high court mulls gay marriage case - Yahoo! News Conn. high court mulls gay marriage case By STEPHANIE REITZ, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 5:27 AM ET HARTFORD, Conn. - The long-simmering question of whether same-sex couples in Connecticut should be allowed to marry is now in the hands of seven state Supreme Court justices. Arguments in the potentially groundbreaking case wrapped up in about three hours Monday, but it likely will be months before justices rule on the lawsuit that eight same-sex couples originally filed in August 2004. The couples, who have been together between 13 and 31 years, allege their equal protection and due process were violated when they were denied marriage licenses in Madison Town Hall. Their case also raises questions about whether the state's 2005 civil unions law &#151; the first adopted nationwide without court pressure &#151; helped or hurt same-sex couples in their quest for equality. The plaintiffs want the court to rule that the state's marriage law discriminates against them because it applies only to heterosexual couples, therefore denying gay couples the financial, social and emotional benefits of marriage. "What is denied to these families is something that goes to the heart of equal protection, which is the right to be part of the fabric of society when they are just the same as other couples and other families," said their attorney, Bennett Klein. The state argued Monday that Connecticut's civil unions law gives the couples the equality they seek, and that the issue is a policy question best left to lawmakers rather than judges. "All of those rights and benefits, at least under state law, have been granted," Assistant Attorney General Jane Rosenberg said. "From a legal perspective, there are no rights that have been taken away from that group and, in fact, equal rights have now been given to that group." As several states consider civil union laws, the Connecticut case could have nationwide ramifications. People on both sides said Monday they are well aware of its significance. "Our 9-year-old said it best: 'How is the world supposed to get better if nothing changes?'" said Geraldine Artis of Clinton, who is a plaintiff along with her partner of 13 years, Suzanne Artis. One recurring theme at Monday's hearing was whether gays and lesbians should be considered a protected group, a legal term for a segment of the population that, among other things, is particularly vulnerable to discrimination and lacks political power. Peter Wolfgang, public policy director for the Family Institute of Connecticut, which opposes same-sex marriage, said that claim is weak. He cited the existence of Connecticut's civil unions law, the growing number of openly gay lawmakers in powerful positions, and a recent legislative committee vote in favor of same-sex marriages. "I think it would be very hard to argue that gays and lesbians are powerless in Connecticut in 2007," Wolfgang said after the hearing. If justices agree with the same-sex couples, they could order the case back to the trial court, with instructions to rule in favor of the couples. They could also order the General Assembly to consider overhauling the current marriage laws. Currently, only Massachusetts allows same-sex couples to marry. Connecticut, Vermont, California, New Jersey, Maine and Washington have laws allowing either civil unions or domestic partnerships, and a civil unions law is expected to take effect in New Hampshire in January. Hawaii extends certain spousal rights to same-sex couples and cohabiting heterosexual pairs. Full Coverage: Gay & Lesbian Issues Anglican church turmoil over gay issues deepens Reuters via Yahoo!

Arguments in the potentially groundbreaking case wrapped up in about three hours Monday, but it likely will be months before justices rule on the lawsuit that eight same-sex couples originally filed in August 2004. The couples, who have been together between 13 and 31 years, allege their equal protection and due process were violated when they were denied marriage licenses in Madison Town Hall. Their case also raises questions about whether the state's 2005 civil unions law &#151; the first adopted nationwide without court pressure &#151; helped or hurt same-sex couples in their quest for equality. The plaintiffs want the court to rule that the state's marriage law discriminates against them because it applies only to heterosexual couples, therefore denying gay couples the financial, social and emotional benefits of marriage. "What is denied to these families is something that goes to the heart of equal protection, which is the right to be part of the fabric of society when they are just the same as other couples and other families," said their attorney, Bennett Klein. The state argued Monday that Connecticut's civil unions law gives the couples the equality they seek, and that the issue is a policy question best left to lawmakers rather than judges. "All of those rights and benefits, at least under state law, have been granted," Assistant Attorney General Jane Rosenberg said. "From a legal perspective, there are no rights that have been taken away from that group and, in fact, equal rights have now been given to that group." As several states consider civil union laws, the Connecticut case could have nationwide ramifications. People on both sides said Monday they are well aware of its significance. "Our 9-year-old said it best: 'How is the world supposed to get better if nothing changes?'" said Geraldine Artis of Clinton, who is a plaintiff along with her partner of 13 years, Suzanne Artis. One recurring theme at Monday's hearing was whether gays and lesbians should be considered a protected group, a legal term for a segment of the population that, among other things, is particularly vulnerable to discrimination and lacks political power. Peter Wolfgang, public policy director for the Family Institute of Connecticut, which opposes same-sex marriage, said that claim is weak. He cited the existence of Connecticut's civil unions law, the growing number of openly gay lawmakers in powerful positions, and a recent legislative committee vote in favor of same-sex marriages. "I think it would be very hard to argue that gays and lesbians are powerless in Connecticut in 2007," Wolfgang said after the hearing. If justices agree with the same-sex couples, they could order the case back to the trial court, with instructions to rule in favor of the couples. They could also order the General Assembly to consider overhauling the current marriage laws. Currently, only Massachusetts allows same-sex couples to marry. Connecticut, Vermont, California, New Jersey, Maine and Washington have laws allowing either civil unions or domestic partnerships, and a civil unions law is expected to take effect in New Hampshire in January. Hawaii extends certain spousal rights to same-sex couples and cohabiting heterosexual pairs. Full Coverage: Gay & Lesbian Issues Anglican church turmoil over gay issues deepens Reuters via Yahoo!

News Child, teen swept away by Colo. flooding 1 hour, 56 minutes ago DENVER - Severe thunderstorms sent normally placid streams over their banks across the Denver area, sweeping away a 2-year-old boy in a stroller and a teenager who was trying to help with a rescue. Both were still missing Tuesday, police said. The toddler's mother had been out for a stroll Monday along a bike path that follows a creek near downtown. It had been a sunny morning, and the thunderstorm developed quickly. In less than an hour, it dumped more than an inch of rain, flooding streets and sending a torrent of water down the tiny creek. The woman sought refuge under a bridge as hail started to fall but realized she needed to leave the path, Denver Fire Department spokesman Phil Champagne said. "Once you enter (the bike path), you're in a chute," Champagne said. "She knew she was in trouble and was trying to get out. She was on the phone with her grandfather, trying to figure out a way out. "The water knocked her down, she was dragged for a little bit and was unable to hold onto the stroller," Champagne said. "What a tragic event. That poor mother to see her child swept away like that." Firefighters struggled against the current to rescue the woman, but her son and stroller were swept downstream. The stroller was later found empty more than a mile away in the South Platte River, Champagne said. Firefighters sent two divers to reach the mother as she clung to a concrete embankment. When she realized firefighters did not her son, she apparently released her grip and drifted downstream, where other firefighters pulled her from the water, Champagne said. In south Denver, a police officer and firefighters were able to save one teenager from a swollen creek in a park, but another teen who apparently was trying to help was swept away and remained missing, Champagne said. Rescuers searched Tuesday for the 2-year-old, believing he could have become stuck in the eddies of the South Platte River. A search for the teen was expected later. The officer was hospitalized with what appeared to be hypothermia, police spokesman John White said. The missing baby's mother was also hospitalized. Their names were not released.

By JEFF BARNARD, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 10:48 AM ET EUGENE, Ore. - Their guilt isn't in question. The six men and four women already admitted being involved in a series of arson fires that did $40 million in damage to research facilities, a ski resort and other businesses in the West. But are they terrorists as the government says? A federal judge was set to hear arguments Tuesday on a motion by the government to add a so-called terrorism enhancement to their sentences. Prosecutors want Judge Ann Aiken to declare the group terrorists &#151; something defense attorneys argue has never happened in 1,200 arsons nationwide claimed by Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front. The defense argues that branding their clients terrorists is more about politics than sentencing. "The Government has Attorney General Alberto Gonzales' political agenda to advance with this case, and nothing else to lose if the Court declines to impose the enhancement," wrote attorney Terri Wood, who represents Stanislas G. Meyerhoff. Meyerhoff faces the stiffest sentence recommendation for his involvement in seven fires and the toppling of a high-tension power line. The terrorism enhancement question will be settled in his case and, under an agreement with all parties, applied to the remaining defendants. Each has pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and arson. A ruling that the 10 are terrorists is not likely to boost the time they spend behind bars &#151; the prosecution recommends three to 16 years &#151; but it could land them in tougher prisons. The fires targeted forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer and, in 1998, Vail Ski Resort. No one was injured, the defense notes in legal motions. The case, known as Operation Backfire, is the biggest prosecution ever of environmental extremists, and has turned on its head the prevailing idea that arsonists have generally acted alone, said Brent Smith, director of the Terrorism Research Center at the University of Arkansas. "We thought these people operated for the last 15 years under this kind of uncoordinated violence approach, just like the extreme right was doing &#151; leaderless resistance," Smith said. "That's why this case is so very different." Prosecution filings argue that though the defendants were never convicted of terrorism, they qualify for the label because at least one of the fires each of them set was intended to change or retaliate against government policy.

News Search on in S.C. for missing officer By BRUCE SMITH, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 2 minutes ago LADSON, S.C. - Dozens of police officers and bloodhounds searched for a missing constable Tuesday after his empty cruiser was found in flames several miles from where he was last seen at a traffic stop, authorities said. Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said authorities had identified a "person of interest" who was being sought on an unrelated weapons charge. But he said officials don't know what happened to Robert Lee Bailey, a 66-year-old constable who works for the Lincolnville Police Department. "It certainly does not look good. But we are hopeful. We have no explanation for what occurred," Cannon said. He said the shooting was not believed to be related to the traffic stop. Bailey was last seen when he pulled a vehicle over about 10:30 p.m. Monday in Lincolnville. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots a few minutes later, and Bailey's cap, two guns, bullet casings and blood were found in a yard. About an hour later, a Highway Patrol officer spotted Bailey's burning car in the parking lot of a church off Interstate 26. Cannon said officials wanted to speak to a 24-year-old man wanted on a federal weapons charge. Walter Fayall, of St. Stephens, was being sought by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. No charges had been filed against him in the missing officer case. Authorities also issued an alert for a black Chevrolet Caprice. Along highways near Lincolnville, a small town about 20 miles west of Charleston, electronic signs listed a fugitive alert. Gary Tucker, data analyst for Faith Assembly of God Church, saw the charred remains of the cruiser early Tuesday. "I just noticed it was a police car and it was torched. And the back window was smashed out," he said. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division sent agents to help in the investigation, spokeswoman Kathryn Richardson said. Constables assist law enforcement agencies and may carry firearms. They must complete a basic training course at a state technical college before they can be appointed by the governor.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/wallace_shooting_anniversary	Memory of Gov. Wallace shooting fades - Yahoo! News Memory of Gov. Wallace shooting fades By BEN EVANS, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 9:30 AM ET LAUREL, Md. - Many of Laurel's older residents can point to the precise spot in the shopping center where Arthur Bremer's gunshots paralyzed Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace and cut short his campaign for the White House in 1972. They recall just what they were doing that May 15 afternoon when they heard that the loner from Milwaukee had shot Wallace five times as he shook hands in the parking lot of what was then the city's main retail plaza. But 35 years later, as Laurel struggles to retain its small-town identity, the collective memory of its most famous event is fading. "People say it happened over near the bank, but other people say it was over there" by the drug store, said Scott Branch, standing behind the counter of the Hobby Works store he manages in the Laurel Shopping Center. Branch said he frequently uses the shooting as a landmark in giving directions to the store. But with the younger set, "I tell them it's where the Books-A-Million is and they say, 'Oh, I know where that is.'" Wallace, who had carried five Southern states as a fist-shaking third party candidate in 1968, was mounting a surprisingly successful run in the Democratic primaries in 1972 before Laurel. Billing himself as the candidate of "the average American," he was viewed as a serious wild card in the party and in Republican President 's bid for re-election. A former segregationist, Wallace was best known for standing defiantly at the all-white University of Alabama in a symbolic face-off with the Justice Department as the National Guard stood by and two black students enrolled in 1963. By 1972, he had tempered his racist rhetoric and adopted a more subtle approach, denouncing federal courts over the "involuntary busing" of schoolchildren to meet desegregation orders and pledging a return to a "law and order" society. Wallace had consistently fared well in polls and a few weeks before Laurel had led the crowded Democratic field in the presidential primary in Florida, where he carried every county. Even as he lay in the hospital after the assassination attempt, he led in Maryland and Michigan. But the shooting effectively ended his national career, diminishing the fiery charisma that had made him a dominant political force in Alabama and leaving him in a wheelchair until his death in 1998. There has never been much discussion of erecting a public marker on the site, city spokesman Jim Collins said. Even though Wallace ultimately apologized and asked forgiveness for his segregationist stands, a memorial would probably meet opposition because of his past, Collins said. Views might be different had Wallace died at the site, he said. Memorials are more common at sites where historical figures died, such as John F. Kennedy in Dallas or the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis. There is no marker, for example, at the Washington hotel where President Reagan was wounded in a 1981 shooting. Michael Brey, who owns the Hobby Works store, said a simple marker might be appropriate. But he said it could be tricky. "How do you do it without making it seem like it's a monument to a man who stood out in front of a school blocking black children from attending?" he said. Today, Laurel hardly resembles the small mill town it once was. Growth from the nation's capital about 20 miles to the south has surrounded the city with suburbs, and a busy commercial district with fast-food restaurants and car dealerships now dwarfs the strip center where Wallace was shot. No one seems to know what happened to the wooden stage that the shopping center would roll out for community events and that Wallace stood upon to deliver his stump speech before wading into the crowd. The bank that sits alone in the middle of the parking lot &#151; and is closest to the shooting site &#151; once displayed a large photograph of the scene in the lobby. But the national chain that bought the bank took it down years ago. "I heard about it when I first opened my account," said 20-year Laurel resident Dianne W. Shields as she left the bank recently. "They had (the photo) posted right there in front. You couldn't miss it ... everybody would talk about it." Wallace's family has never considered requesting a marker at the site, said Wallace's son, George Wallace Jr., a former Alabama Public Service commissioner who lost a bid to become lieutenant governor last year. If the local community wanted one, the family wouldn't object, he said. But it isn't planning to get involved. "Time passes, memories fade. It's part of life," he said. "It is a very historic site though. It sure is." (This version CORRECTS spelling of Brey.)

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/arson_pleas	Arsonists, yes. But are they terrorists? - Yahoo! News Arsonists, yes. But are they terrorists? By JEFF BARNARD, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 10:48 AM ET EUGENE, Ore. - Their guilt isn't in question. The six men and four women already admitted being involved in a series of arson fires that did $40 million in damage to research facilities, a ski resort and other businesses in the West. But are they terrorists as the government says? A federal judge was set to hear arguments Tuesday on a motion by the government to add a so-called terrorism enhancement to their sentences. Prosecutors want Judge Ann Aiken to declare the group terrorists &#151; something defense attorneys argue has never happened in 1,200 arsons nationwide claimed by Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front. The defense argues that branding their clients terrorists is more about politics than sentencing. "The Government has Attorney General Alberto Gonzales' political agenda to advance with this case, and nothing else to lose if the Court declines to impose the enhancement," wrote attorney Terri Wood, who represents Stanislas G. Meyerhoff. Meyerhoff faces the stiffest sentence recommendation for his involvement in seven fires and the toppling of a high-tension power line. The terrorism enhancement question will be settled in his case and, under an agreement with all parties, applied to the remaining defendants. Each has pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and arson. A ruling that the 10 are terrorists is not likely to boost the time they spend behind bars &#151; the prosecution recommends three to 16 years &#151; but it could land them in tougher prisons. The fires targeted forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer and, in 1998, Vail Ski Resort. No one was injured, the defense notes in legal motions. The case, known as Operation Backfire, is the biggest prosecution ever of environmental extremists, and has turned on its head the prevailing idea that arsonists have generally acted alone, said Brent Smith, director of the Terrorism Research Center at the University of Arkansas. "We thought these people operated for the last 15 years under this kind of uncoordinated violence approach, just like the extreme right was doing &#151; leaderless resistance," Smith said. "That's why this case is so very different." Prosecution filings argue that though the defendants were never convicted of terrorism, they qualify for the label because at least one of the fires each of them set was intended to change or retaliate against government policy.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/fort_drum_missing_soldiers	Missing soldiers from Fort Drum - Yahoo! News Missing soldiers from Fort Drum FORT DRUM, N.Y. - The seven American victims of a weekend ambush in were members of the storied 10th Mountain Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Army officials in Iraq said Tuesday. The attack near Mahmoudiya, in a Sunni stronghold 20 miles south of Baghdad, left four U.S. soldiers and an Iraqi translator dead, and three other soldiers missing. acknowledged for the first time that it believes the missing soldiers are in terrorist hands. The Islamic State of Iraq &#151; an al-Qaida front group that has claimed to have captured the soldiers &#151; has warned the U.S. to stop its massive search for the missing. Military officials would not release the names of the soldiers until their families were notified but confirmed they were assigned to Company D, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, nicknamed the "Polar Bears," said Lt. Col. Paul Fitzpatrick, a Fort Drum spokesman. All the missing soldiers are men, Fitzpatrick said. "It's been the unfortunate experience that soldiers who have been captured have not all turned out well. We are hoping this turns out to be an exception," he said. The 10th Mountain Division has a reputation for success that dates to World War II. Ready to go anywhere in the world within 48 hours, the 10th Mountain is trained to fight in steamy jungles, sandy deserts, cities and, of course, mountains. Families of the soldiers released the names of two of the dead on Monday &#151; Sgt. 1st Class James David Connell Jr., 40, of Lake City, Tenn., and Pfc. Daniel Courneya, 19, of Vermontville, Mich. Connell's family learned of his death Saturday afternoon, they said. The soldier had just recovered from a shrapnel wound to the leg and had visited his family on leave this month. The family is now planning a memorial service in Lake City and a burial at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his brother, Jeff Connell. "I'm proud of my dad, because he didn't really fight for himself, he fought for the country," Connell's teenage daughter, Courtney, told Knoxville's WATE-TV. In Michigan, students at Maple Valley High School created a memorial for Courneya, who graduated in 2005 and was well-known in the small community southwest of Lansing. He was a member of the school's track and soccer teams and played clarinet in the band. "It's a tribute of photos, posters, plaques and a picture of him in his uniform," school official Kelly Zank told The Associated Press on Tuesday. His death was announced Monday over the school's public address system, and a moment of silence was observed, she said. Courneya's mother, Wendy Thompson, said his wife, Jennifer, called family members Saturday night to tell them he had been killed. Thompson said her husband, Army Spc. David Thompson, was in Iraq and returning home after learning of his stepson's death. If all three soldiers now missing were taken alive, it would be the biggest single abduction of U.S. soldiers in Iraq since March 23, 2003, when Pvt. Jessica Lynch and six others were captured in an ambush near Nasiriyah that also left 11 Americans dead. The 2nd Brigade Combat Team is in the 10th month of a 15-month tour in Iraq. The brigade was also deployed to Iraq in 2005. The 10th Mountain Division made its reputation in World War II, when soldiers scaled a sheer, 1,500-foot cliff under cover of darkness and fought their way through the snowy mountains of northern Italy in 1945. That spearheaded the drive that would liberate the country from the Nazis. The 10th Mountain was the Army's most frequently deployed division during the 1990s, serving in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere. The division's members became the first regular U.S. ground troops to be sent to Central Asia as part of American's response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Its soldiers provided security for U.S. Air Force fighter and combat search-and-rescue teams in Uzbekistan.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/fort_drum_missing_soldiers	Missing soldiers from Fort Drum - Yahoo! News Missing soldiers from Fort Drum FORT DRUM, N.Y. - The seven American victims of a weekend ambush in were members of the storied 10th Mountain Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Army officials in Iraq said Tuesday. The attack near Mahmoudiya, in a Sunni stronghold 20 miles south of Baghdad, left four U.S. soldiers and an Iraqi translator dead, and three other soldiers missing. acknowledged for the first time that it believes the missing soldiers are in terrorist hands. The Islamic State of Iraq &#151; an al-Qaida front group that has claimed to have captured the soldiers &#151; has warned the U.S. to stop its massive search for the missing. Military officials would not release the names of the soldiers until their families were notified but confirmed they were assigned to Company D, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, nicknamed the "Polar Bears," said Lt. Col. Paul Fitzpatrick, a Fort Drum spokesman. All the missing soldiers are men, Fitzpatrick said. "It's been the unfortunate experience that soldiers who have been captured have not all turned out well. We are hoping this turns out to be an exception," he said. The 10th Mountain Division has a reputation for success that dates to World War II. Ready to go anywhere in the world within 48 hours, the 10th Mountain is trained to fight in steamy jungles, sandy deserts, cities and, of course, mountains. Families of the soldiers released the names of two of the dead on Monday &#151; Sgt. 1st Class James David Connell Jr., 40, of Lake City, Tenn., and Pfc. Daniel Courneya, 19, of Vermontville, Mich. Connell's family learned of his death Saturday afternoon, they said. The soldier had just recovered from a shrapnel wound to the leg and had visited his family on leave this month. The family is now planning a memorial service in Lake City and a burial at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his brother, Jeff Connell. "I'm proud of my dad, because he didn't really fight for himself, he fought for the country," Connell's teenage daughter, Courtney, told Knoxville's WATE-TV. In Michigan, students at Maple Valley High School created a memorial for Courneya, who graduated in 2005 and was well-known in the small community southwest of Lansing. He was a member of the school's track and soccer teams and played clarinet in the band. "It's a tribute of photos, posters, plaques and a picture of him in his uniform," school official Kelly Zank told The Associated Press on Tuesday. His death was announced Monday over the school's public address system, and a moment of silence was observed, she said. Courneya's mother, Wendy Thompson, said his wife, Jennifer, called family members Saturday night to tell them he had been killed. Thompson said her husband, Army Spc. David Thompson, was in Iraq and returning home after learning of his stepson's death. If all three soldiers now missing were taken alive, it would be the biggest single abduction of U.S. soldiers in Iraq since March 23, 2003, when Pvt. Jessica Lynch and six others were captured in an ambush near Nasiriyah that also left 11 Americans dead. The 2nd Brigade Combat Team is in the 10th month of a 15-month tour in Iraq. The brigade was also deployed to Iraq in 2005. The 10th Mountain Division made its reputation in World War II, when soldiers scaled a sheer, 1,500-foot cliff under cover of darkness and fought their way through the snowy mountains of northern Italy in 1945. That spearheaded the drive that would liberate the country from the Nazis. The 10th Mountain was the Army's most frequently deployed division during the 1990s, serving in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere. The division's members became the first regular U.S. ground troops to be sent to Central Asia as part of American's response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Its soldiers provided security for U.S. Air Force fighter and combat search-and-rescue teams in Uzbekistan.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/missing_officer	Search on in S.C. for missing officer - Yahoo! News Search on in S.C. for missing officer By BRUCE SMITH, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 3 minutes ago LADSON, S.C. - Dozens of police officers and bloodhounds searched for a missing constable Tuesday after his empty cruiser was found in flames several miles from where he was last seen at a traffic stop, authorities said. Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said authorities had identified a "person of interest" who was being sought on an unrelated weapons charge. But he said officials don't know what happened to Robert Lee Bailey, a 66-year-old constable who works for the Lincolnville Police Department. "It certainly does not look good. But we are hopeful. We have no explanation for what occurred," Cannon said. He said the shooting was not believed to be related to the traffic stop. Bailey was last seen when he pulled a vehicle over about 10:30 p.m. Monday in Lincolnville. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots a few minutes later, and Bailey's cap, two guns, bullet casings and blood were found in a yard. About an hour later, a Highway Patrol officer spotted Bailey's burning car in the parking lot of a church off Interstate 26. Cannon said officials wanted to speak to a 24-year-old man wanted on a federal weapons charge. Walter Fayall, of St. Stephens, was being sought by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. No charges had been filed against him in the missing officer case. Authorities also issued an alert for a black Chevrolet Caprice. Along highways near Lincolnville, a small town about 20 miles west of Charleston, electronic signs listed a fugitive alert. Gary Tucker, data analyst for Faith Assembly of God Church, saw the charred remains of the cruiser early Tuesday. "I just noticed it was a police car and it was torched. And the back window was smashed out," he said. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division sent agents to help in the investigation, spokeswoman Kathryn Richardson said. Constables assist law enforcement agencies and may carry firearms. They must complete a basic training course at a state technical college before they can be appointed by the governor.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/katrina_opportunity	New Orleans neighborhood rescues itself - Yahoo! News New Orleans neighborhood rescues itself By JOHN MORENO GONZALES, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 2:09 PM ET NEW ORLEANS - Paul Pablovich was the very picture of a good neighbor as he shoveled debris off the curb and mowed other people's lawns in Lakeview, a middle-class section of town that was swamped with 15 feet of water during Hurricane Katrina and is now a patchwork of gutted and newly built homes. But he wasn't doing it entirely out of the goodness of his heart. He was protecting his investment. Pablovich, an entrepreneur who lived in a different part of New Orleans before Katrina, bought a bungalow on the street from an elderly resident after the storm, renovated it and plans to live there with his fiancee. He purchased a second abandoned house for $107,000, fixed it up and hopes to resell it for $214,000. He would like to "flip" several other properties on the block, too. The way he sees it, capitalism is the road to recovery for Lakeview. "It's how the country was built," Pablovich, 38, said of the $600,000 he has pumped into the real estate market. "Free-market economics will kick in." Lakeview, a 7,000-home mostly white enclave in a city that is predominantly black, has emerged as a success story in the reconstruction of New Orleans through entrepreneurs like Pablovich and strong civic organization that existed long before the storm. In contrast, hard-hit black middle-class neighborhoods in eastern New Orleans do not have the same financial means and civic organization, and are not drawing nearly as much private investment. As a result, their recovery is crawling. "If you're going to speculate, you're much more likely to speculate in Lakeview than you would in the east," said Louisiana State University sociology professor Jeanne Hulbert. "But you could end up, potentially, with a social and economic structure in the city that really carves out the black middle class." Nearly 21 months after Katrina, Lakeview has lights and other utilities, but still has no firehouse and no public school. But it is a community so fiercely independent it tried in the 1990s to secede from the city. And its residents &#151; who include business executives and other professionals &#151; have considerable organizational skills. Lakeview's churches arranged for volunteers around the country to plant trees along Canal Boulevard, the main drag. And recently, nearly 1,000 original and potential new residents came to a civic association tutorial on how to navigate the city's bureaucracy and find a reputable contractor. In fact, the civic association drew up a list of recommended contractors by running credit checks on them and consulting the Better Business Bureau. The group is so organized it has compiled its own data on rebuilding, finding in a February survey that 67 percent of Lakeview's lots were in some stage of transformation. Seventeen percent were newly inhabited, just over 26 percent were under repair, and 23 percent had been demolished to pave the way for rebuilding. In contrast, neighborhood leaders in eastern New Orleans, which encompasses four ZIP codes to Lakeview's one, are just now undertaking a house-to-house count. Independent research, at first glance, suggests Lakeview and eastern New Orleans have rebuilt at similar rates. GCR and Associates Inc. found last week that based on utility hookups, close to 36 percent of residents in the Lakeview ZIP code were back, versus 33 percent in the eastern New Orleans ZIP codes. However, Richard Campanella, associate director of Tulane and Xavier universities' Center for Biomedical Research, found that the flooding in Lakeview was, by some measures, far more severe. For example, nearly 22 percent of homes in Lakeview got more than 8 feet of water, compared with 3.5 percent in eastern New Orleans. Lakeview has eclipsed eastern New Orleans in real estate sales since Katrina. Sixty-nine houses were sold there nine months before the disaster, compared with 147 during the past nine months of recovery, a 113 percent jump. In eastern New Orleans, 215 single-family homes were sold in the nine months before Katrina, and 287 during the past nine months, a 33 percent increase. As he painted over the rust on an iron fence that ringed his family's home in eastern New Orleans, Hank Long said it was obvious to him that his part of town was rebuilding with sweat equity more often than financial equity. "In Lakeview, many of those houses were already paid for. A lot of people are still paying their mortgages here," said Long, a 60-year-old black man. "Nobody has big money here. They gutted out their house, and that's as far as they got. Whatever they could do, they did on their own." Hulbert of LSU said: "You have to remember the black middle class only took hold in the 1960s. That is different from several generations of middle-class life. Many middle-class blacks in New Orleans were the first in their families to go to college, and it appears many had their entire savings tied up in their homes." David Bell, president of the East New Orleans Neighborhood Advisory Commission, which formed in March to bind together 15 area groups, said a lack of private investment means eastern New Orleans is much more dependent on government recovery aid, with all the bureaucracy and politics that entails. For example, a centerpiece of the eastern New Orleans redevelopment plan is a proposed $100 million shopping strip. But federal grants for the project will not be fully released until the city comes up with 10 percent. Back in Lakeview, residents like to say that they ask mostly one thing of the city: for it to get out of the way. TKTMJ Inc., a builder that is selling modular homes in the neighborhood, found the area so profitable that it established an office in Lakeview and has dubbed one of its designs "The Lakeview." Tommy Callia, a sales representative with the company, noted that most of those able to rebuild are middle class and white. "I think we're not going to be as diverse as we once were, and that's going to be sad," he said. "You can say it's a little like a gumbo: If you don't have all the ingredients, something is missing in the taste."

News New Orleans neighborhood rescues itself By JOHN MORENO GONZALES, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 2:09 PM ET NEW ORLEANS - Paul Pablovich was the very picture of a good neighbor as he shoveled debris off the curb and mowed other people's lawns in Lakeview, a middle-class section of town that was swamped with 15 feet of water during Hurricane Katrina and is now a patchwork of gutted and newly built homes. But he wasn't doing it entirely out of the goodness of his heart. He was protecting his investment. Pablovich, an entrepreneur who lived in a different part of New Orleans before Katrina, bought a bungalow on the street from an elderly resident after the storm, renovated it and plans to live there with his fiancee. He purchased a second abandoned house for $107,000, fixed it up and hopes to resell it for $214,000. He would like to "flip" several other properties on the block, too. The way he sees it, capitalism is the road to recovery for Lakeview. "It's how the country was built," Pablovich, 38, said of the $600,000 he has pumped into the real estate market. "Free-market economics will kick in." Lakeview, a 7,000-home mostly white enclave in a city that is predominantly black, has emerged as a success story in the reconstruction of New Orleans through entrepreneurs like Pablovich and strong civic organization that existed long before the storm. In contrast, hard-hit black middle-class neighborhoods in eastern New Orleans do not have the same financial means and civic organization, and are not drawing nearly as much private investment. As a result, their recovery is crawling. "If you're going to speculate, you're much more likely to speculate in Lakeview than you would in the east," said Louisiana State University sociology professor Jeanne Hulbert. "But you could end up, potentially, with a social and economic structure in the city that really carves out the black middle class." Nearly 21 months after Katrina, Lakeview has lights and other utilities, but still has no firehouse and no public school. But it is a community so fiercely independent it tried in the 1990s to secede from the city. And its residents &#151; who include business executives and other professionals &#151; have considerable organizational skills. Lakeview's churches arranged for volunteers around the country to plant trees along Canal Boulevard, the main drag. And recently, nearly 1,000 original and potential new residents came to a civic association tutorial on how to navigate the city's bureaucracy and find a reputable contractor. In fact, the civic association drew up a list of recommended contractors by running credit checks on them and consulting the Better Business Bureau. The group is so organized it has compiled its own data on rebuilding, finding in a February survey that 67 percent of Lakeview's lots were in some stage of transformation. Seventeen percent were newly inhabited, just over 26 percent were under repair, and 23 percent had been demolished to pave the way for rebuilding. In contrast, neighborhood leaders in eastern New Orleans, which encompasses four ZIP codes to Lakeview's one, are just now undertaking a house-to-house count. Independent research, at first glance, suggests Lakeview and eastern New Orleans have rebuilt at similar rates. GCR and Associates Inc. found last week that based on utility hookups, close to 36 percent of residents in the Lakeview ZIP code were back, versus 33 percent in the eastern New Orleans ZIP codes. However, Richard Campanella, associate director of Tulane and Xavier universities' Center for Biomedical Research, found that the flooding in Lakeview was, by some measures, far more severe. For example, nearly 22 percent of homes in Lakeview got more than 8 feet of water, compared with 3.5 percent in eastern New Orleans. Lakeview has eclipsed eastern New Orleans in real estate sales since Katrina. Sixty-nine houses were sold there nine months before the disaster, compared with 147 during the past nine months of recovery, a 113 percent jump. In eastern New Orleans, 215 single-family homes were sold in the nine months before Katrina, and 287 during the past nine months, a 33 percent increase. As he painted over the rust on an iron fence that ringed his family's home in eastern New Orleans, Hank Long said it was obvious to him that his part of town was rebuilding with sweat equity more often than financial equity. "In Lakeview, many of those houses were already paid for. A lot of people are still paying their mortgages here," said Long, a 60-year-old black man. "Nobody has big money here. They gutted out their house, and that's as far as they got. Whatever they could do, they did on their own." Hulbert of LSU said: "You have to remember the black middle class only took hold in the 1960s. That is different from several generations of middle-class life. Many middle-class blacks in New Orleans were the first in their families to go to college, and it appears many had their entire savings tied up in their homes." David Bell, president of the East New Orleans Neighborhood Advisory Commission, which formed in March to bind together 15 area groups, said a lack of private investment means eastern New Orleans is much more dependent on government recovery aid, with all the bureaucracy and politics that entails. For example, a centerpiece of the eastern New Orleans redevelopment plan is a proposed $100 million shopping strip. But federal grants for the project will not be fully released until the city comes up with 10 percent. Back in Lakeview, residents like to say that they ask mostly one thing of the city: for it to get out of the way. TKTMJ Inc., a builder that is selling modular homes in the neighborhood, found the area so profitable that it established an office in Lakeview and has dubbed one of its designs "The Lakeview." Tommy Callia, a sales representative with the company, noted that most of those able to rebuild are middle class and white. "I think we're not going to be as diverse as we once were, and that's going to be sad," he said. "You can say it's a little like a gumbo: If you don't have all the ingredients, something is missing in the taste."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/wildfires	Hundreds more flee massive Fla. wildfire - Yahoo! News Hundreds more flee massive Fla. wildfire By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 1:05 PM ET LAKE CITY, Fla. - Authorities evacuated hundreds of homes after a massive wildfire along the Georgia-Florida border jumped a containment line overnight, authorities said Tuesday. Firefighters pushed the flames back to the containment line, but dry weather and 15 mph wind in north Florida was expected to further hinder their work. "If we can just get through today," said Russell Hubright, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman. Between 250 and 500 homes west of U.S. 441 had to be evacuated for a second time when the fire line was breached, Florida Highway Patrol Lt. Michael Burroughs said. An additional 570 people who were ordered out of homes east of the roadway were still waiting to return. The wildfire had raced through the Okefenokee Swamp in southeast Georgia and into northern Florida after being started by lightning more than a week ago. By Tuesday, it had burned 109,000 acres in Florida and 139,813 acres of swampland in Georgia &#151; nearly 390 square miles in all. Flames jumped a containment line at the fire's western edge, but firefighters used bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters to extinguish them, said John Speaks, deputy incident commander with the forest service. The fire was about 1 1/2 miles from U.S. 441. On the western edge of the Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia, Fargo residents were told to stay alert as wind forecast at up to 20 mph pushed the blaze against fire breaks plowed between the swamp and the city of 380 people. "Everybody's being told not to let their guard down, don't unpack," said Laura Polant, a fire information officer in Fargo. "Residents are still being told to be prepared to leave, because the call can come at any time." In Florida, the blaze was 50 percent contained Tuesday. The smoke had lifted enough to open Interstates 10 and 75 to traffic, but drivers were warned that periodic closures were still possible. Another large wildfire, in northeastern Minnesota and Ontario, could be brought under control by the end of the week, officials said. No one has been seriously hurt in the fire, which has burned 117 square miles of Minnesota and Canada, but many cabins and smaller structures &#151; more than 100 in all &#151; have been destroyed. Associated Press writers Russ Bynum in Savannah, Ga., and Jennifer Kay in Miami contributed to this report.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/wildfires	Hundreds more flee massive Fla. wildfire - Yahoo! News Hundreds more flee massive Fla. wildfire By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 1:05 PM ET LAKE CITY, Fla. - Authorities evacuated hundreds of homes after a massive wildfire along the Georgia-Florida border jumped a containment line overnight, authorities said Tuesday. Firefighters pushed the flames back to the containment line, but dry weather and 15 mph wind in north Florida was expected to further hinder their work. "If we can just get through today," said Russell Hubright, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman. Between 250 and 500 homes west of U.S. 441 had to be evacuated for a second time when the fire line was breached, Florida Highway Patrol Lt. Michael Burroughs said. An additional 570 people who were ordered out of homes east of the roadway were still waiting to return. The wildfire had raced through the Okefenokee Swamp in southeast Georgia and into northern Florida after being started by lightning more than a week ago. By Tuesday, it had burned 109,000 acres in Florida and 139,813 acres of swampland in Georgia &#151; nearly 390 square miles in all. Flames jumped a containment line at the fire's western edge, but firefighters used bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters to extinguish them, said John Speaks, deputy incident commander with the forest service. The fire was about 1 1/2 miles from U.S. 441. On the western edge of the Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia, Fargo residents were told to stay alert as wind forecast at up to 20 mph pushed the blaze against fire breaks plowed between the swamp and the city of 380 people. "Everybody's being told not to let their guard down, don't unpack," said Laura Polant, a fire information officer in Fargo. "Residents are still being told to be prepared to leave, because the call can come at any time." In Florida, the blaze was 50 percent contained Tuesday. The smoke had lifted enough to open Interstates 10 and 75 to traffic, but drivers were warned that periodic closures were still possible. Another large wildfire, in northeastern Minnesota and Ontario, could be brought under control by the end of the week, officials said. No one has been seriously hurt in the fire, which has burned 117 square miles of Minnesota and Canada, but many cabins and smaller structures &#151; more than 100 in all &#151; have been destroyed. Associated Press writers Russ Bynum in Savannah, Ga., and Jennifer Kay in Miami contributed to this report.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/pesticides_schools	AP: Children face exposure to pesticides - Yahoo! News AP: Children face exposure to pesticides By GARANCE BURKE, Associated Press Writer STRATHMORE, Calif. - On Grandparents Day, Domitila Lemus accompanied her 8-year-old granddaughter to school. As the girls lined up behind Sunnyside Union Elementary, a foul mist drifted onto the playground from the adjacent orange groves, witnesses say. Lemus started coughing, and two children collapsed in spasms, vomiting on the blacktop. She and the little girls have since recovered without apparent lasting effects. But an Associated Press investigation has found that over the past decade, hundreds, possibly thousands, of schoolchildren in California and other agricultural states have been exposed to farm chemicals linked to sickness, brain damage and birth defects. The family of at least one California teenager suspects pesticides caused her death. There are no federal laws specifically against spraying near schools, and advocates say California and the seven other states that have laws or policies creating buffer zones around schools to protect them from pesticides don't do enough to enforce them. "The regulations are inadequate. In the vast majority of cases, people who didn't follow the laws received at best a $400 fine," said Margaret Reeves, a scientist with the Pesticide Action Network, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco. The pesticide industry says it is committed to safety, and regulators say they are doing their best to enforce the laws. "Everyone wants to protect children," said California Department of Pesticide Regulation spokesman Glenn Brank. He said his agency is doing what it can to enforce the law with a shortage of agricultural inspectors. In the Strathmore incident last November, grandparents said the spraying was being done less than 150 feet from the children. Tulare County authorities fined an unlicensed pest removal company $1,100 for spraying a restricted weed killer that morning. But no action was taken over what witnesses said happened to the children. Because no one reported the incident as a case of pesticide drift, county agricultural inspectors never swabbed the jungle gym or took grass samples, making it impossible to establish whether pesticide had, in fact, drifted onto the playground. does not keep comprehensive national figures on students and teachers sickened by drifting pesticide. In California, the No. 1 farm state and the one with the best records, there were 590 pesticide-related illnesses at schools from 1996 to 2005, according to figures given to the AP by the state. More than a third of those were due to pesticide drift, the figures show. Activists say that those numbers are low and that many cases are never even reported. In California's long, flat interior, spraying season lasts seven months, from March through September. When citrus trees blossom and grapevines climb trellises, Lemus prays to the Virgin Mary that her granddaughter won't come home with her eyes watering and head pounding, unable to breathe. Tulare County, where she lives, is one of the nation's most fertile farm regions, with more than half the schools within a quarter-mile of agricultural fields, according to the nonprofit Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment. As suburbs push close to farmland, the rate of pesticide poisoning among children nationwide has risen in recent years, according to a 2005 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association Journal of the American Medical Association . The study found that 40 percent of all children sickened by pesticides at school were victims of drift &#151; pesticide carried on the breeze. Research on pregnant women exposed to common pesticides has suggested higher rates of premature birth, and poor neurological development and smaller head circumferences among their babies. The effects on children of small, repeated exposures over a long period of time are unclear, said University of California, Berkeley epidemiologist Brenda Eskenazi. But acute pesticide poisoning can cause nausea, blurred vision, an abnormally fast heart rate, paralysis and death. Chrissy Garavito, a 15-year-old high school sophomore, died in Fontana in 1997 of a heart rhythm disturbance her mother believes was triggered by exposure to chemicals sprayed at the school. Authorities never confirmed that pesticides contributed to her death. In 2001, pesticide poisoning nearly killed Elena Dominguez, then a sixth-grader in Wenatchee, Wash. One day, after playing Frisbee during gym class across the street from an apple orchard, she passed out at her desk. "She was in a stupor," said her mother, Cindy Dominguez. "She couldn't talk, her eyes were rolling back in her head." Emergency room doctors dismissed Elena's abnormally fast heart rate as a symptom of dehydration, gave her intravenous fluids and sent her home. Three weeks later, it happened again. "I was at a track meet and all of a sudden I felt really, really tired," said Elena, now 18. "I made it to the finish line and just fell over." Investigators found her clothes were soaked in the pesticide Endosulfan I; it had been picked up from residue on the grass and absorbed into her bloodstream through her skin. Officials later found five other pesticides on school grounds and fined the apple grower for forging his applicator's license. The Dominguez family sued the orchard owner and the Wenatchee school district, which established rules requiring students to stay inside after a spraying, among other things. State officials believe it is the only district in Washington with such limitations. But keeping students inside may not be enough. Two years ago, 600 students and staff members were evacuated from an Edinburg, Texas, elementary school after pesticides drifted from a cotton field into the school's air conditioning system. Thirty-nine people developed nausea and headaches. EPA officials say they have no real idea how often pesticides waft onto school grounds. The EPA must register pesticides before they are sold, but federal law does not restrict where they can be sprayed. "We implement the laws that Congress gives us," said Ruth Allen, an EPA epidemiologist. Once the EPA approves a product, federal law requires manufacturers to report any "unreasonable adverse effects on the environment of the pesticide" that their products cause. Activists say industry is essentially allowed to police itself. CropLife America, a national organization representing suppliers of farm pesticides, said their use near schools is well-regulated. "We're really committed to public safety," said spokeswoman Donna Uchida. "Any kind of use of a pesticide has a labeling requirement that is imposed to protect human health and the environment." California has some of the strictest pesticide laws in the nation. Under state law, growers and pest control companies can be fined if pesticide drifts from a field and sickens people. A 2002 state law allows county authorities to establish a no-spray buffer zone of a quarter-mile around schools. But Tulare County has not done so. State officials said they did not know how many counties have set up such buffer zones. Lemus and environmentalists are pushing for pesticide-free zones throughout California. "Why don't they tell us they'll spray beforehand so we can bring our children inside?" Lemus said.

News World mayors hold climate summit in NYC By SARA KUGLER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 12:18 PM ET NEW YORK - City leaders from around the globe gathered Tuesday for an environmental summit hosted by former and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg with a message that the campaign to reverse global warming begins with the world's mayors. "It is in cities that the battle to tackle climate change will be won or lost," London Mayor Ken Livingstone said. Mayors and local leaders from more than 30 cities kicked off the conference, known as the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit, which first met in 2005 in London. Organizers say cities bear a significant responsibility to address climate change because they cover less than 1 percent of the Earth's surface but generate 80 percent of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. "Our theme is not whether we should work together, because we know that we must, it is how and how fast we can do so," New York's Deputy Mayor Dan Doctoroff said. The summit includes mayors from Seoul to Sao Paulo, Albuquerque to Addis Ababa. The meeting comes at a time when many countries are struggling to address global and national standards for carbon reduction. This week, U.N. delegates are meeting in Germany to gear up for December negotiations on a new set of international rules for controlling greenhouse gas emissions. The new accord would succeed the Kyoto Protocol, which ends in 2012. When the Group of Eight major industrialized countries &#151; the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and Russia &#151; met in Germany in June, climate change will also be on the agenda. Meanwhile, the mayors said Tuesday, local governments can't wait around. "Where national governments can't or won't lead, cities will," Toronto Mayor David Miller said. In a discussion on transportation, the mayor of the Brazilian city of Curitiba described his city's solutions, which include a Bus Rapid Transit system, while Livingstone described London's program to reduce traffic by charging motorists extra money in the city center. Bloomberg recently announced his intention to begin a similar traffic charging program in Manhattan. London traffic congestion dropped by 20 percent, and carbon emissions in the central zone similarly decreased, Livingstone said. The fee &#151; equal to about $16 &#151; has gone up since it started in 2003. "People may not like paying the 5 pounds a day, but they certainly didn't want to live with that style of congestion," Livingstone said. He said his city's next goal is to charge more for higher-polluting cars, a pricing scale that could mean a $50 equivalent charge for the worst offenders. Organizers of the conference, which ends Thursday, also invited a number of business leaders to this year's gathering in an effort to involve the private sector. They hope to convince companies that going green &#151; through innovative construction, transportation alternatives and other environmental changes &#151; is a profitable economic move.

News Cruise ship runs aground off Alaska By ANNE SUTTON, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 5:11 AM ET JUNEAU, Alaska - When the Empress of the North ran aground, the band played on &#151; as everyone disembarked in a safe and orderly fashion. Passengers jolted awake by the ship hitting a charted reef 50 miles southwest of Juneau early Monday were ordered to don lifejackets and gather in the ballroom, where a singer and piano player entertained them with songs including "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" as they waited for rescue. Passengers praised the ship's crew for taking charge. "They just seemed to know what they were doing. They were caring, courteous, the whole thing, and I think that's what kept everybody calm," said Mary Crosby, 83, of Seattle. National Transportation Safety Board National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the grounding of the riverboat-style cruise ship, which had 206 passengers and 75 crew members on board. One person was taken to a hospital for observation, a Juneau city official said. When Coast Guard helicopters reached the area, the vessel was listing at the southern end of Icy Strait and had begun taking on water, the Coast Guard said. As the ship's pumps worked to remove the water, the passengers were transferred safely to other boats in the area and then to an Alaska state ferry to be taken to Juneau. The Empress of the North floated free of the rock during the evacuation, and the crew was able to stabilize the ship, said the Coast Guard. The ship arrived in Juneau with a Coast Guard escort about nine hours after the grounding. The ferry Columbia arrived shortly after. State officials said the hull sustained significant damage and an empty fuel tank was breached during the grounding. A light oil sheen was seen in the area but officials were uncertain if the ship was the source. Coast Guard Petty Officer Barry Lane said Coast Guard inspectors did an initial survey of the ship as it was moored in Juneau's Auke Bay and will pass the information on to the NTSB. It wasn't immediately clear why the cruise ship ran aground, said Coast Guard officials. It was drizzling in Juneau but the seas were calm. Good Samaritans were first on the scene of the grounding and passengers were initially evacuated onto lifeboats, a charter fishing boat, a tugboat, another small cruise ship and a coast guard cutter before the Columbia arrived. "The morning was incredible. You had anybody and everybody that could get there and they all got there as quick as they could and all were willing to help out," said Coast Guard Capt. Mark Guillory, federal on-scene coordinator. Passengers left the ship with only their personal identification and medications. They were to be reunited with their belongings later in Juneau. All had been flown to Seattle by evening, said company officials. "It couldn't have been better orchestrated the way things fell into place," said Chief Petty Officer Barry Lane. The Empress of the North is operated by Majestic America Line of Seattle. The ship has 112 staterooms, a three-story paddlewheel and galleries featuring Native American masks and Russian artwork, including Faberge eggs, according to its Web site. The 360-foot ship is less than half the size of the average cruise ship in the Caribbean, and is also dwarfed by most cruise other ships off the Alaska coast. The grounding occurred on the second day of a seven-day cruise, said Dan Miller, a spokesman for Majestic America. The American-built ship is billed by the company as the only overnight paddlewheel vessel in use on Alaska cruises. It also is used on cruises on the Columbia River between Washington state and Oregon. The Empress of the North has had other problems since it began operating in mid-2003. In October of that year, it hit a navigation lock on the Snake River in Washington. It has also run aground at least twice before &#151; once after developing steering problems on the Columbia River, and once on a sandbar near Washougal, Wash., as it tried to avoid a barge.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/gay_marriage	Conn. high court mulls gay marriage case - Yahoo! News Conn. high court mulls gay marriage case By STEPHANIE REITZ, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 5:27 AM ET HARTFORD, Conn. - The long-simmering question of whether same-sex couples in Connecticut should be allowed to marry is now in the hands of seven state Supreme Court justices. Arguments in the potentially groundbreaking case wrapped up in about three hours Monday, but it likely will be months before justices rule on the lawsuit that eight same-sex couples originally filed in August 2004. The couples, who have been together between 13 and 31 years, allege their equal protection and due process were violated when they were denied marriage licenses in Madison Town Hall. Their case also raises questions about whether the state's 2005 civil unions law &#151; the first adopted nationwide without court pressure &#151; helped or hurt same-sex couples in their quest for equality. The plaintiffs want the court to rule that the state's marriage law discriminates against them because it applies only to heterosexual couples, therefore denying gay couples the financial, social and emotional benefits of marriage. "What is denied to these families is something that goes to the heart of equal protection, which is the right to be part of the fabric of society when they are just the same as other couples and other families," said their attorney, Bennett Klein. The state argued Monday that Connecticut's civil unions law gives the couples the equality they seek, and that the issue is a policy question best left to lawmakers rather than judges. "All of those rights and benefits, at least under state law, have been granted," Assistant Attorney General Jane Rosenberg said. "From a legal perspective, there are no rights that have been taken away from that group and, in fact, equal rights have now been given to that group." As several states consider civil union laws, the Connecticut case could have nationwide ramifications. People on both sides said Monday they are well aware of its significance. "Our 9-year-old said it best: 'How is the world supposed to get better if nothing changes?'" said Geraldine Artis of Clinton, who is a plaintiff along with her partner of 13 years, Suzanne Artis. One recurring theme at Monday's hearing was whether gays and lesbians should be considered a protected group, a legal term for a segment of the population that, among other things, is particularly vulnerable to discrimination and lacks political power. Peter Wolfgang, public policy director for the Family Institute of Connecticut, which opposes same-sex marriage, said that claim is weak. He cited the existence of Connecticut's civil unions law, the growing number of openly gay lawmakers in powerful positions, and a recent legislative committee vote in favor of same-sex marriages. "I think it would be very hard to argue that gays and lesbians are powerless in Connecticut in 2007," Wolfgang said after the hearing. If justices agree with the same-sex couples, they could order the case back to the trial court, with instructions to rule in favor of the couples. They could also order the General Assembly to consider overhauling the current marriage laws. Currently, only Massachusetts allows same-sex couples to marry. Connecticut, Vermont, California, New Jersey, Maine and Washington have laws allowing either civil unions or domestic partnerships, and a civil unions law is expected to take effect in New Hampshire in January. Hawaii extends certain spousal rights to same-sex couples and cohabiting heterosexual pairs. Full Coverage: Gay & Lesbian Issues Anglican church turmoil over gay issues deepens Reuters via Yahoo!

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/pesticides_schools	AP: Children face exposure to pesticides - Yahoo! News AP: Children face exposure to pesticides By GARANCE BURKE, Associated Press Writer STRATHMORE, Calif. - On Grandparents Day, Domitila Lemus accompanied her 8-year-old granddaughter to school. As the girls lined up behind Sunnyside Union Elementary, a foul mist drifted onto the playground from the adjacent orange groves, witnesses say. Lemus started coughing, and two children collapsed in spasms, vomiting on the blacktop. She and the little girls have since recovered without apparent lasting effects. But an Associated Press investigation has found that over the past decade, hundreds, possibly thousands, of schoolchildren in California and other agricultural states have been exposed to farm chemicals linked to sickness, brain damage and birth defects. The family of at least one California teenager suspects pesticides caused her death. There are no federal laws specifically against spraying near schools, and advocates say California and the seven other states that have laws or policies creating buffer zones around schools to protect them from pesticides don't do enough to enforce them. "The regulations are inadequate. In the vast majority of cases, people who didn't follow the laws received at best a $400 fine," said Margaret Reeves, a scientist with the Pesticide Action Network, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco. The pesticide industry says it is committed to safety, and regulators say they are doing their best to enforce the laws. "Everyone wants to protect children," said California Department of Pesticide Regulation spokesman Glenn Brank. He said his agency is doing what it can to enforce the law with a shortage of agricultural inspectors. In the Strathmore incident last November, grandparents said the spraying was being done less than 150 feet from the children. Tulare County authorities fined an unlicensed pest removal company $1,100 for spraying a restricted weed killer that morning. But no action was taken over what witnesses said happened to the children. Because no one reported the incident as a case of pesticide drift, county agricultural inspectors never swabbed the jungle gym or took grass samples, making it impossible to establish whether pesticide had, in fact, drifted onto the playground. does not keep comprehensive national figures on students and teachers sickened by drifting pesticide. In California, the No. 1 farm state and the one with the best records, there were 590 pesticide-related illnesses at schools from 1996 to 2005, according to figures given to the AP by the state. More than a third of those were due to pesticide drift, the figures show. Activists say that those numbers are low and that many cases are never even reported. In California's long, flat interior, spraying season lasts seven months, from March through September. When citrus trees blossom and grapevines climb trellises, Lemus prays to the Virgin Mary that her granddaughter won't come home with her eyes watering and head pounding, unable to breathe. Tulare County, where she lives, is one of the nation's most fertile farm regions, with more than half the schools within a quarter-mile of agricultural fields, according to the nonprofit Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment. As suburbs push close to farmland, the rate of pesticide poisoning among children nationwide has risen in recent years, according to a 2005 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association Journal of the American Medical Association . The study found that 40 percent of all children sickened by pesticides at school were victims of drift &#151; pesticide carried on the breeze. Research on pregnant women exposed to common pesticides has suggested higher rates of premature birth, and poor neurological development and smaller head circumferences among their babies. The effects on children of small, repeated exposures over a long period of time are unclear, said University of California, Berkeley epidemiologist Brenda Eskenazi. But acute pesticide poisoning can cause nausea, blurred vision, an abnormally fast heart rate, paralysis and death. Chrissy Garavito, a 15-year-old high school sophomore, died in Fontana in 1997 of a heart rhythm disturbance her mother believes was triggered by exposure to chemicals sprayed at the school. Authorities never confirmed that pesticides contributed to her death. In 2001, pesticide poisoning nearly killed Elena Dominguez, then a sixth-grader in Wenatchee, Wash. One day, after playing Frisbee during gym class across the street from an apple orchard, she passed out at her desk. "She was in a stupor," said her mother, Cindy Dominguez. "She couldn't talk, her eyes were rolling back in her head." Emergency room doctors dismissed Elena's abnormally fast heart rate as a symptom of dehydration, gave her intravenous fluids and sent her home. Three weeks later, it happened again. "I was at a track meet and all of a sudden I felt really, really tired," said Elena, now 18. "I made it to the finish line and just fell over." Investigators found her clothes were soaked in the pesticide Endosulfan I; it had been picked up from residue on the grass and absorbed into her bloodstream through her skin. Officials later found five other pesticides on school grounds and fined the apple grower for forging his applicator's license. The Dominguez family sued the orchard owner and the Wenatchee school district, which established rules requiring students to stay inside after a spraying, among other things. State officials believe it is the only district in Washington with such limitations. But keeping students inside may not be enough. Two years ago, 600 students and staff members were evacuated from an Edinburg, Texas, elementary school after pesticides drifted from a cotton field into the school's air conditioning system. Thirty-nine people developed nausea and headaches. EPA officials say they have no real idea how often pesticides waft onto school grounds. The EPA must register pesticides before they are sold, but federal law does not restrict where they can be sprayed. "We implement the laws that Congress gives us," said Ruth Allen, an EPA epidemiologist. Once the EPA approves a product, federal law requires manufacturers to report any "unreasonable adverse effects on the environment of the pesticide" that their products cause. Activists say industry is essentially allowed to police itself. CropLife America, a national organization representing suppliers of farm pesticides, said their use near schools is well-regulated. "We're really committed to public safety," said spokeswoman Donna Uchida. "Any kind of use of a pesticide has a labeling requirement that is imposed to protect human health and the environment." California has some of the strictest pesticide laws in the nation. Under state law, growers and pest control companies can be fined if pesticide drifts from a field and sickens people. A 2002 state law allows county authorities to establish a no-spray buffer zone of a quarter-mile around schools. But Tulare County has not done so. State officials said they did not know how many counties have set up such buffer zones. Lemus and environmentalists are pushing for pesticide-free zones throughout California. "Why don't they tell us they'll spray beforehand so we can bring our children inside?" Lemus said.

There are no federal laws specifically against spraying near schools, and advocates say California and the seven other states that have laws or policies creating buffer zones around schools to protect them from pesticides don't do enough to enforce them. "The regulations are inadequate. In the vast majority of cases, people who didn't follow the laws received at best a $400 fine," said Margaret Reeves, a scientist with the Pesticide Action Network, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco. The pesticide industry says it is committed to safety, and regulators say they are doing their best to enforce the laws. "Everyone wants to protect children," said California Department of Pesticide Regulation spokesman Glenn Brank. He said his agency is doing what it can to enforce the law with a shortage of agricultural inspectors. In the Strathmore incident last November, grandparents said the spraying was being done less than 150 feet from the children. Tulare County authorities fined an unlicensed pest removal company $1,100 for spraying a restricted weed killer that morning. But no action was taken over what witnesses said happened to the children. Because no one reported the incident as a case of pesticide drift, county agricultural inspectors never swabbed the jungle gym or took grass samples, making it impossible to establish whether pesticide had, in fact, drifted onto the playground. does not keep comprehensive national figures on students and teachers sickened by drifting pesticide. In California, the No. 1 farm state and the one with the best records, there were 590 pesticide-related illnesses at schools from 1996 to 2005, according to figures given to the AP by the state. More than a third of those were due to pesticide drift, the figures show. Activists say that those numbers are low and that many cases are never even reported. In California's long, flat interior, spraying season lasts seven months, from March through September. When citrus trees blossom and grapevines climb trellises, Lemus prays to the Virgin Mary that her granddaughter won't come home with her eyes watering and head pounding, unable to breathe. Tulare County, where she lives, is one of the nation's most fertile farm regions, with more than half the schools within a quarter-mile of agricultural fields, according to the nonprofit Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment. As suburbs push close to farmland, the rate of pesticide poisoning among children nationwide has risen in recent years, according to a 2005 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association Journal of the American Medical Association . The study found that 40 percent of all children sickened by pesticides at school were victims of drift &#151; pesticide carried on the breeze. Research on pregnant women exposed to common pesticides has suggested higher rates of premature birth, and poor neurological development and smaller head circumferences among their babies. The effects on children of small, repeated exposures over a long period of time are unclear, said University of California, Berkeley epidemiologist Brenda Eskenazi. But acute pesticide poisoning can cause nausea, blurred vision, an abnormally fast heart rate, paralysis and death. Chrissy Garavito, a 15-year-old high school sophomore, died in Fontana in 1997 of a heart rhythm disturbance her mother believes was triggered by exposure to chemicals sprayed at the school. Authorities never confirmed that pesticides contributed to her death. In 2001, pesticide poisoning nearly killed Elena Dominguez, then a sixth-grader in Wenatchee, Wash. One day, after playing Frisbee during gym class across the street from an apple orchard, she passed out at her desk. "She was in a stupor," said her mother, Cindy Dominguez. "She couldn't talk, her eyes were rolling back in her head." Emergency room doctors dismissed Elena's abnormally fast heart rate as a symptom of dehydration, gave her intravenous fluids and sent her home. Three weeks later, it happened again. "I was at a track meet and all of a sudden I felt really, really tired," said Elena, now 18. "I made it to the finish line and just fell over." Investigators found her clothes were soaked in the pesticide Endosulfan I; it had been picked up from residue on the grass and absorbed into her bloodstream through her skin. Officials later found five other pesticides on school grounds and fined the apple grower for forging his applicator's license. The Dominguez family sued the orchard owner and the Wenatchee school district, which established rules requiring students to stay inside after a spraying, among other things. State officials believe it is the only district in Washington with such limitations. But keeping students inside may not be enough. Two years ago, 600 students and staff members were evacuated from an Edinburg, Texas, elementary school after pesticides drifted from a cotton field into the school's air conditioning system. Thirty-nine people developed nausea and headaches. EPA officials say they have no real idea how often pesticides waft onto school grounds. The EPA must register pesticides before they are sold, but federal law does not restrict where they can be sprayed. "We implement the laws that Congress gives us," said Ruth Allen, an EPA epidemiologist. Once the EPA approves a product, federal law requires manufacturers to report any "unreasonable adverse effects on the environment of the pesticide" that their products cause. Activists say industry is essentially allowed to police itself. CropLife America, a national organization representing suppliers of farm pesticides, said their use near schools is well-regulated. "We're really committed to public safety," said spokeswoman Donna Uchida. "Any kind of use of a pesticide has a labeling requirement that is imposed to protect human health and the environment." California has some of the strictest pesticide laws in the nation. Under state law, growers and pest control companies can be fined if pesticide drifts from a field and sickens people. A 2002 state law allows county authorities to establish a no-spray buffer zone of a quarter-mile around schools. But Tulare County has not done so. State officials said they did not know how many counties have set up such buffer zones. Lemus and environmentalists are pushing for pesticide-free zones throughout California. "Why don't they tell us they'll spray beforehand so we can bring our children inside?" Lemus said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/newport_arson_probe	Arson squad probes 6 Newport, RI, fires - Yahoo! News Arson squad probes 6 Newport, RI, fires Tue May 15, 8:50 AM ET NEWPORT, R.I. - An arson task force is investigating a string of six fires that have broken out in the city since May, three of them in just the past week. On Sunday, fires that started within a few hours of each other damaged two century-old homes, one of them a Victorian house that had been converted into apartments. A few days earlier, a fire destroyed a downtown souvenir shop. "We're asking the public to be very vigilant," police Captain Wayne Morrison said. "Any and all information could be useful, even if people think it's trivial." The task force, which includes members of the city's police and fire departments, the state Fire Marshal's Office and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, is looking into six fires dating to a March 5 blaze in a mixed-use building. "We're all apprehensive," said Federico Santi, who owns an antiques business, The Drawing Room of Newport. "We're wondering, 'Am I going to go to bed and wake up with a fireman breaking down the door?'" Newport, a city of about 25,000 residents, is known for its colonial heritage and Gilded Age mansions. It is bordered by Rhode Island Sound and Narragansett Bay.

News Arson squad probes 6 Newport, RI, fires Tue May 15, 8:50 AM ET NEWPORT, R.I. - An arson task force is investigating a string of six fires that have broken out in the city since May, three of them in just the past week. On Sunday, fires that started within a few hours of each other damaged two century-old homes, one of them a Victorian house that had been converted into apartments. A few days earlier, a fire destroyed a downtown souvenir shop. "We're asking the public to be very vigilant," police Captain Wayne Morrison said. "Any and all information could be useful, even if people think it's trivial." The task force, which includes members of the city's police and fire departments, the state Fire Marshal's Office and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, is looking into six fires dating to a March 5 blaze in a mixed-use building. "We're all apprehensive," said Federico Santi, who owns an antiques business, The Drawing Room of Newport. "We're wondering, 'Am I going to go to bed and wake up with a fireman breaking down the door?'" Newport, a city of about 25,000 residents, is known for its colonial heritage and Gilded Age mansions. It is bordered by Rhode Island Sound and Narragansett Bay.

News Miami holds top spot on rude driver list By SARAH LARIMER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 9:07 AM ET MIAMI - For the second straight year, rude Miami drivers have earned the city the title of worst road rage in a survey released Tuesday. Miami motorists said they saw other drivers slam on their brakes, run red lights and talk on cell phones, according to AutoVantage, a Connecticut-based automobile membership club offering travel services and roadside assistance. Other cities near the top of the rude drivers list were New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. South Miami resident Erik Pinto told The Associated Press he's probably seen every bad driving habit on Miami's roads. "You don't want to know what I've seen," Pinto said. "I've seen everything. I'm from L.A., and we don't see the crazy drivers that you see here." Portland, Ore., drivers were the least likely of the cities to see other motorists tailgating on the roadways, and St. Louis motorists were the least likely to swear at another driver, the survey found. Minneapolis-St. Paul was rated the most courteous city in 2006 but slipped to the middle of the list this year. The most frequent cause of road rage cited in the survey was impatient motorists. Drivers also cited poor driving in fast lanes and driving while stressed, frustrated or angry. "The best piece of advice is to take a deep breath. Slow down, be aware and be careful," AutoVantage spokesman Todd Smith said, adding the aim of the survey is to increase driver safety across the nation. More than 2,500 drivers who regularly commute in 25 major metropolitan areas were asked to rate road rage and rude driving in telephone surveys between January and March. The survey was conducted by Prince Market Research has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/space_shuttle	Shuttle rolls back out to launch pad - Yahoo! News Shuttle rolls back out to launch pad By MIKE SCHNEIDER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 12:05 PM ET CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - After 2 1/2 months of repairs to its external fuel tank, space shuttle Atlantis returned to the launch pad Tuesday in anticipation of an early June liftoff to the international space station. The 3.4-mile, early-morning trip aboard the massive crawler-transporter took under seven hours from when the shuttle left the Vehicle Assembly Building to when it was secured at the launch pad. The last time Atlantis made that trip was in February. The shuttle was on its launch pad when a freak hail storm swept through and pounded fuel tank with golf ball-sized hail that left thousands of dings in the tank's insulating foam. managers postponed a planned mid-March launch and ordered the shuttle returned to the Vehicle Assembly Building for repairs. Technicians sprayed on new insulation foam in some areas, hand-poured foam on other areas and sanded down spots. When the shuttle rolled out Tuesday, the orange tank had hundreds of white speckles at the top showing their work. The launch is now planned for no earlier than June 8. A final decision will be made at the end of the month. "It's a real success story &#151; almost bordering on an Apollo 13 type story to develop that in such a short time," John Chapman, NASA's manager of the external tank project, said last week, referring to the engineering ingenuity that delivered the moon-bound crew safely back to Earth in 1970 after an oxygen tank ruptured on the spacecraft. Foam debris coming off the external fuel tank has been of special concern to NASA since the seven astronauts aboard Columbia perished when a piece of foam from the tank struck a wing during launch, allowing fiery gases to penetrate the space shuttle while returning to Earth. Astronaut Clayton Anderson has been added to the previously six-man Atlantis crew so he can replace U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams on the international space station. Until the shuttle arrives, Williams and her colleagues at the space station will make do with 2 1/2 tons of fuel, air, water and other supplies that were delivered Tuesday by a Russian cargo vehicle. NASA managers hope Atlantis' launch puts the space agency back on a regular schedule of shuttle missions after a five-month hiatus. The last space shuttle flight was in December, and three more missions are scheduled for this year after Atlantis. The space agency has at least 14 more missions to finish building the space station and repair the before the shuttle fleet is grounded in 2010. The next-generation spacecraft, Orion, isn't scheduled to fly astronauts until 2015. Last week, leaders of almost two dozen aerospace companies sent a letter to members of Congress urging them to support funding NASA an additional $1.4 billion above the administration's 2008 budget request of $17.3 billion to narrow the gap when the United States won't have manned spaceflights.

News Miami holds top spot on rude driver list By SARAH LARIMER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 9:07 AM ET MIAMI - For the second straight year, rude Miami drivers have earned the city the title of worst road rage in a survey released Tuesday. Miami motorists said they saw other drivers slam on their brakes, run red lights and talk on cell phones, according to AutoVantage, a Connecticut-based automobile membership club offering travel services and roadside assistance. Other cities near the top of the rude drivers list were New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. South Miami resident Erik Pinto told The Associated Press he's probably seen every bad driving habit on Miami's roads. "You don't want to know what I've seen," Pinto said. "I've seen everything. I'm from L.A., and we don't see the crazy drivers that you see here." Portland, Ore., drivers were the least likely of the cities to see other motorists tailgating on the roadways, and St. Louis motorists were the least likely to swear at another driver, the survey found.

News Miami holds top spot on rude driver list By SARAH LARIMER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 9:07 AM ET MIAMI - For the second straight year, rude Miami drivers have earned the city the title of worst road rage in a survey released Tuesday. Miami motorists said they saw other drivers slam on their brakes, run red lights and talk on cell phones, according to AutoVantage, a Connecticut-based automobile membership club offering travel services and roadside assistance. Other cities near the top of the rude drivers list were New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. South Miami resident Erik Pinto told The Associated Press he's probably seen every bad driving habit on Miami's roads. "You don't want to know what I've seen," Pinto said. "I've seen everything. I'm from L.A., and we don't see the crazy drivers that you see here." Portland, Ore., drivers were the least likely of the cities to see other motorists tailgating on the roadways, and St. Louis motorists were the least likely to swear at another driver, the survey found. Minneapolis-St. Paul was rated the most courteous city in 2006 but slipped to the middle of the list this year. The most frequent cause of road rage cited in the survey was impatient motorists.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/immigration_texas	Groups: Block Texas town's immigrant ban - Yahoo! News Groups: Block Texas town's immigrant ban By ANABELLE GARAY, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 43 minutes ago DALLAS - Latino activists and civil liberties advocates asked a federal judge Tuesday to block a voter-approved ordinance that prohibits landlords from renting apartments to most illegal immigrants in the Dallas suburb of Farmers Branch. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union American Civil Liberties Union , which have already sued the city, requested the temporary restraining order in U.S. District Court. The ordinance, scheduled to take effect next Tuesday, requires apartment managers to verify that renters are U.S. citizens or legal immigrants before leasing to them, with some exceptions. Violators face fines of up to $500. "It is unfortunate that the residents of Farmers Branch have chosen to implement a law which is not only bad policy, but is likely also unconstitutional," said Lisa Graybill, legal director for the ACLU of Texas. "Now the issue will have to be resolved in federal court." The city is preparing a response to the request, said Matthew Boyle, an attorney representing Farmers Branch. City council members first approved the ban in November without discussion, then revised it in January to include exemptions for minors, seniors and some mixed-status families. On Saturday, residents voted to approve the ban with 68 percent of voters in favor, according to unofficial results. Councilman Tim O'Hare, the ordinance's lead proponent, contends the city's economy and quality of life will improve if illegal immigrants are kept out. O'Hare declined to comment Tuesday. Since 1970, Farmers Branch has changed from a small, predominantly white bedroom community with a declining population to a city of almost 28,000 people, about 37 percent of them Hispanic, according to the U.S. Farmers Branch already faces four lawsuits brought by civil rights groups, residents, property owners and businesses, who say the ordinance discriminates and puts landlords in the precarious position of acting as federal immigration officers. Their attorneys argue the ordinance attempts to regulate immigration, a duty that is exclusively the federal government's. Nationwide, more than 90 local governments have proposed, passed or rejected laws prohibiting landlords from leasing to illegal immigrants, penalizing businesses that employ them or training police to enforce immigration laws.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/border_biometrics	AP IMPACT: Laser visas are rarely used - Yahoo! News AP IMPACT: Laser visas are rarely used By ELLIOT SPAGAT, Associated Press Writer SAN DIEGO - The face- and fingerprint-matching technology that has been touted over the past decade as a sophisticated new way to stop terrorists and illegal immigrants from entering the country through Mexico has one major drawback: U.S. border inspectors almost never use it. In fact, the necessary equipment is not even installed in vehicle lanes along the border. Government officials told The Associated Press that checking more people would create too big a backup at the border, where hours-long traffic jams are already common. Some members of Congress who voted for the system in 1996 are complaining they were misled. They said the intent was to use biometrics &#151; or a person's unique physical traits &#151; to screen everyone. "Congress would not have gone to the trouble of requiring biometric features on the border crossing card if it knew the administration would not require that those features be read by scanners," said Rep. Lamar Smith ( ), R-Texas, who wrote the legislation. The U.S. government has spent tens of millions of dollars issuing visa cards digitally embedded with the holder's photo and fingerprints. Holders of the cards come across the border tens of millions of times each year. But on average, in only about 2 percent of those cases are the cardholders screened with the biometric technology to verify their identities and check law-enforcement records, said Paul Morris, Customs and Border Protection's executive director of admissibility requirements and migration control. The checks are done consistently only on the small portion of cardholders who seek permission to travel beyond the border region. "As the technology becomes available, we can expand the current level of biometric matching," Morris said. "There is not a technology solution currently available that will not cause delays that are well beyond the acceptable levels." Beginning in 1998, the high-tech "laser visas" have been issued to 9.1 million Mexicans for short visits to the United States. The laser visas, which look like driver's licenses, have a 1.4-inch optical memory stripe holding personal information such as name, gender and birth date. The stripe also stores the owner's digitized facial photo and two fingerprints. Cardholders coming across the border may be asked to press their fingers against a glass and pose for a photo, while their card pulls up their biometric file &#151; a process that takes an extra 30 seconds or so per person. The photo and fingerprints can also be instantly checked against criminal and terrorist watch lists. The laser visas entitle Mexicans to travel 25 miles from the border &#151; slightly farther in Arizona &#151; for 30 days. Cardholders can also apply for a permit to travel anywhere in the U.S. for up to six months. Border inspectors routinely swipe the laser visas through a machine to retrieve the basic personal information and to call up a photo. But, with some exceptions, the inspectors use the facial- and fingerprint-matching technology only for those applying at the border for one of the six-month permits, Morris said. That practice means that most of those who are checked are not selected at random; they know they are going to be scanned when they come across. The government contract for laser visas was worth $28.6 million from 2000 to 2006, and awarded a five-year renewal in March to General Dynamics Corp. worth $28.5 million, according to Homeland Security. That price tag excludes the cost of opening new consulates to handle the rush of applicants. The State Department established consulates across the border from Laredo, Texas, and Nogales, Ariz. In Tijuana, Mexico, the consulate took over an old gymnasium across town. The 1996 law said anyone presenting a border crossing card "is not permitted to cross over the border into the U.S. unless the biometric identifier contained on the card matches the appropriate biometric characteristics of the alien." But Sandra Raynes, consular officer at the U.S. consulate in Tijuana, said: "If they were to check everyone, you'd have lines all the way down to Cabo San Lucas," about 1,100 miles south of San Diego. U.S. officials said biometrics are only part of its effort to stem illegal crossings. An inspector's wits and agency intelligence are also key, they said. Biometrics "is one tool in our toolbox," said Kelly Klundt, a Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman. Also, the laminated cards have reduced fraud because they are difficult to counterfeit, officials said. Older visas looked like crumpled library cards, some dating to the 1950s. Authorities said women in their 60s used cards with photographs of teenage girls because the cards had no expiration dates. Former Rep. Jim Kolbe, a Republican who left Congress in January after 22 years representing a district on the Arizona border, said lawmakers expected checks on all cardholders, though there was no timetable. "We definitely intended to go further with it than we have," he said. "Ten years later, it seems incredible that we've only gotten this far with it." The 14 pedestrian booths at San Ysidro, the nation's busiest border crossing by far, are equipped with fingerprint glass but no cameras. But that glass is not used on the 30,000 people who walk though daily. There is neither type of equipment in the 24 vehicle lanes, which handle about 35,000 cars and 250 buses a day. Applicants for the six-month permits are asked to pull aside into a small parking lot, get out and walk up to a booth, where they are fingerprinted and photographed for verification. Initially, border crossings did not even have equipment to lift personal information off the cards, let alone the biometric data. Jeffrey Davidow, U.S. ambassador to Mexico from 1998 to 2001, recalls members of Congress visiting the border to see the machines, which were never used when the lawmakers were gone. "I'd tell them that it was all show, that it doesn't work, that the card is not doing what it's supposed to do," Davidow said. He said his warnings elicited shrugs. There were also technological setbacks. Equipment to verify photos and fingerprints often failed to read through sweat, scratches and other wallet "crud," according to an internal Homeland Security report. A test at five Texas crossings in the spring of 2004 showed that 731 out of 1,740 cards, or 42 percent, were unreadable, according to the report, which was provided to The Associated Press by someone who insisted on anonymity because the government did not authorize its release. Homeland Security officials did not have more recent figures on how many cards are correctly read. But they said technical problems have been resolved.

Military officials would not release the names of the soldiers until their families were notified but confirmed they were assigned to Company D, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, nicknamed the "Polar Bears," said Lt. Col. Paul Fitzpatrick, a Fort Drum spokesman. All the missing soldiers are men, Fitzpatrick said. "It's been the unfortunate experience that soldiers who have been captured have not all turned out well. We are hoping this turns out to be an exception," he said. The 10th Mountain Division has a reputation for success that dates to World War II. Ready to go anywhere in the world within 48 hours, the 10th Mountain is trained to fight in steamy jungles, sandy deserts, cities and, of course, mountains. Families of the soldiers released the names of two of the dead on Monday &#151; Sgt. 1st Class James David Connell Jr., 40, of Lake City, Tenn., and Pfc. Daniel Courneya, 19, of Vermontville, Mich. Connell's family learned of his death Saturday afternoon, they said. The soldier had just recovered from a shrapnel wound to the leg and had visited his family on leave this month. The family is now planning a memorial service in Lake City and a burial at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his brother, Jeff Connell. "I'm proud of my dad, because he didn't really fight for himself, he fought for the country," Connell's teenage daughter, Courtney, told Knoxville's WATE-TV. In Michigan, students at Maple Valley High School created a memorial for Courneya, who graduated in 2005 and was well-known in the small community southwest of Lansing. He was a member of the school's track and soccer teams and played clarinet in the band. "It's a tribute of photos, posters, plaques and a picture of him in his uniform," school official Kelly Zank told The Associated Press on Tuesday. His death was announced Monday over the school's public address system, and a moment of silence was observed, she said. Courneya's mother, Wendy Thompson, said his wife, Jennifer, called family members Saturday night to tell them he had been killed. Thompson said her husband, Army Spc. David Thompson, was in Iraq and returning home after learning of his stepson's death. If all three soldiers now missing were taken alive, it would be the biggest single abduction of U.S. soldiers in Iraq since March 23, 2003, when Pvt. Jessica Lynch and six others were captured in an ambush near Nasiriyah that also left 11 Americans dead. The 2nd Brigade Combat Team is in the 10th month of a 15-month tour in Iraq. The brigade was also deployed to Iraq in 2005. The 10th Mountain Division made its reputation in World War II, when soldiers scaled a sheer, 1,500-foot cliff under cover of darkness and fought their way through the snowy mountains of northern Italy in 1945. That spearheaded the drive that would liberate the country from the Nazis. The 10th Mountain was the Army's most frequently deployed division during the 1990s, serving in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere. The division's members became the first regular U.S. ground troops to be sent to Central Asia as part of American's response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Its soldiers provided security for U.S. Air Force fighter and combat search-and-rescue teams in Uzbekistan.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/padilla_terror_charges	CIA agent testifies at Padilla trial - Yahoo! News CIA agent testifies at Padilla trial By CURT ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer MIAMI - A covert officer who was permitted to testify wearing a disguise and using an alias described in court Tuesday how U.S. officials in obtained a truckload of al-Qaida documents, including a form later linked to suspected operative Jose Padilla. The officer, whose true identity is classified, gave his name as Tom Langston. He appeared in court with a beard and glasses, although the nature of the disguise was not obvious or made public. Prosecutors declined to say whether any concealment was even used. The arrangement was approved by U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke at the request of the CIA, which sought to protect the officer's ability to continue doing clandestine work overseas. It was not disclosed to the jury. Langston testified that he was working in December 2001 at a classified CIA site in Kandahar, Afghanistan, when an Afghan man driving a pickup truck showed up with thousands of pages of documents. Among them was a bright blue binder containing what appeared to be dozens of forms in Arabic, one of which reportedly turned out to be Padilla's. Prosecutors say his fingerprints are on the "mujahedeen data form," which had questions on language skills, military experience, religious education and other areas. The form is crucial to the government's case because it could link Padilla and his two suspected co-conspirators &#151; Adham Amin Hassoun and Kifah Wael Jayyousi &#151; to al-Qaida. The three are charged with being part of a U.S.-based support cell for Islamic extremists around the world, including al-Qaida. The unidentified Afghan man, Langston said, was affiliated with an Afghan tribal leader opposed to the country's Islamic fundamentalist Taliban rulers, who were then battling U.S. forces. Under the Taliban, al-Qaida had established terrorist training camps in Afghanistan in the years leading to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. "He was loyal to some individuals who were cooperating with us against the Taliban and the terrorist element," the CIA officer said. The Afghan man told the CIA he collected the documents from a house occupied by Arabs who had fled shortly before the 2001 U.S. invasion and were known locally to be affiliated with al-Qaida. Langston said the man was not paid or given any other benefit by U.S. officials for the documents, although he was prohibited after prosecutors objected from answering questions about whether the man's tribal leader was compensated. "I think he took this initiative on his own," the CIA officer said of the man who brought the documents. At one point, Langston grew reluctant to answer a question from Padilla attorney Orlando do Campo about how CIA officers and analysts handle documents such as those in the binder. "I'm a little uncomfortable answering the question because it gets into methods. I'm sworn to protect sources and methods," he said. The binder and other documents were kept in a locked room at the CIA installation in Kandahar, then placed in boxes and taken on U.S. vehicles and aircraft to the in Islamabad, Pakistan. The binder was in a box labeled "vegetable oil," the CIA officer said. The FBI legal attache there in late 2001, Jennifer Keenan, testified Tuesday that she remembered the binder among 22 boxes, trunks and other containers because it appeared to hold information important for U.S. counterterrorism investigators. "We were very grateful to find this," Keenan said. "I called it a pledge form. It says pledge on it." It wasn't until later that the FBI in Washington was able to link one of the forms to Padilla, who allegedly filled it out under the name Abu Abdullah al-Mujahir in July 2000. A key to making that link was information gathered during U.S. interrogations of other suspected al-Qaida figures, according to documents filed in the Padilla case. Testimony will resume Thursday. Prosecutors say their witnesses will include Yahya Goba, a member of the "Lackawanna Six" group of men who pleaded guilty in 2003 in New York to attending al-Qaida camps. Goba, who received a 10-year prison sentence, will testify that he attended the same camp as Padilla and filled out an identical form, prosecutor Brian Frazier said. Padilla, a 36-year-old former Chicago gang member and U.S. citizen, was arrested by the FBI in May 2002 when he arrived at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The Bush administration initially accused him of plotting to detonate a radioactive "dirty bomb" in a U.S. city, but those allegations are not part of the criminal indictment. Padilla was added to the Miami case after 3 1/2 years in military custody as an enemy combatant. His case was the subject of a lengthy legal battle over the president's wartime detention powers over U.S. citizens. Padilla and his two co-defendants face up to life in prison if convicted of all charges.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/space_shuttle	Shuttle rolls back out to launch pad - Yahoo! News Shuttle rolls back out to launch pad By MIKE SCHNEIDER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 12:05 PM ET CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - After 2 1/2 months of repairs to its external fuel tank, space shuttle Atlantis returned to the launch pad Tuesday in anticipation of an early June liftoff to the international space station. The 3.4-mile, early-morning trip aboard the massive crawler-transporter took under seven hours from when the shuttle left the Vehicle Assembly Building to when it was secured at the launch pad. The last time Atlantis made that trip was in February. The shuttle was on its launch pad when a freak hail storm swept through and pounded fuel tank with golf ball-sized hail that left thousands of dings in the tank's insulating foam. managers postponed a planned mid-March launch and ordered the shuttle returned to the Vehicle Assembly Building for repairs. Technicians sprayed on new insulation foam in some areas, hand-poured foam on other areas and sanded down spots. When the shuttle rolled out Tuesday, the orange tank had hundreds of white speckles at the top showing their work. The launch is now planned for no earlier than June 8. A final decision will be made at the end of the month. "It's a real success story &#151; almost bordering on an Apollo 13 type story to develop that in such a short time," John Chapman, NASA's manager of the external tank project, said last week, referring to the engineering ingenuity that delivered the moon-bound crew safely back to Earth in 1970 after an oxygen tank ruptured on the spacecraft. Foam debris coming off the external fuel tank has been of special concern to NASA since the seven astronauts aboard Columbia perished when a piece of foam from the tank struck a wing during launch, allowing fiery gases to penetrate the space shuttle while returning to Earth. Astronaut Clayton Anderson has been added to the previously six-man Atlantis crew so he can replace U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams on the international space station. Until the shuttle arrives, Williams and her colleagues at the space station will make do with 2 1/2 tons of fuel, air, water and other supplies that were delivered Tuesday by a Russian cargo vehicle. NASA managers hope Atlantis' launch puts the space agency back on a regular schedule of shuttle missions after a five-month hiatus. The last space shuttle flight was in December, and three more missions are scheduled for this year after Atlantis. The space agency has at least 14 more missions to finish building the space station and repair the before the shuttle fleet is grounded in 2010. The next-generation spacecraft, Orion, isn't scheduled to fly astronauts until 2015. Last week, leaders of almost two dozen aerospace companies sent a letter to members of Congress urging them to support funding NASA an additional $1.4 billion above the administration's 2008 budget request of $17.3 billion to narrow the gap when the United States won't have manned spaceflights. "Future U.S. leadership in space is at stake," the letter said.

News Shuttle rolls back out to launch pad By MIKE SCHNEIDER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 12:05 PM ET CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - After 2 1/2 months of repairs to its external fuel tank, space shuttle Atlantis returned to the launch pad Tuesday in anticipation of an early June liftoff to the international space station. The 3.4-mile, early-morning trip aboard the massive crawler-transporter took under seven hours from when the shuttle left the Vehicle Assembly Building to when it was secured at the launch pad. The last time Atlantis made that trip was in February. The shuttle was on its launch pad when a freak hail storm swept through and pounded fuel tank with golf ball-sized hail that left thousands of dings in the tank's insulating foam. managers postponed a planned mid-March launch and ordered the shuttle returned to the Vehicle Assembly Building for repairs. Technicians sprayed on new insulation foam in some areas, hand-poured foam on other areas and sanded down spots. When the shuttle rolled out Tuesday, the orange tank had hundreds of white speckles at the top showing their work. The launch is now planned for no earlier than June 8. A final decision will be made at the end of the month. "It's a real success story &#151; almost bordering on an Apollo 13 type story to develop that in such a short time," John Chapman, NASA's manager of the external tank project, said last week, referring to the engineering ingenuity that delivered the moon-bound crew safely back to Earth in 1970 after an oxygen tank ruptured on the spacecraft. Foam debris coming off the external fuel tank has been of special concern to NASA since the seven astronauts aboard Columbia perished when a piece of foam from the tank struck a wing during launch, allowing fiery gases to penetrate the space shuttle while returning to Earth. Astronaut Clayton Anderson has been added to the previously six-man Atlantis crew so he can replace U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams on the international space station. Until the shuttle arrives, Williams and her colleagues at the space station will make do with 2 1/2 tons of fuel, air, water and other supplies that were delivered Tuesday by a Russian cargo vehicle. NASA managers hope Atlantis' launch puts the space agency back on a regular schedule of shuttle missions after a five-month hiatus. The last space shuttle flight was in December, and three more missions are scheduled for this year after Atlantis. The space agency has at least 14 more missions to finish building the space station and repair the before the shuttle fleet is grounded in 2010. The next-generation spacecraft, Orion, isn't scheduled to fly astronauts until 2015. Last week, leaders of almost two dozen aerospace companies sent a letter to members of Congress urging them to support funding NASA an additional $1.4 billion above the administration's 2008 budget request of $17.3 billion to narrow the gap when the United States won't have manned spaceflights. "Future U.S. leadership in space is at stake," the letter said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/eric_rudolph	Extremist taunts his victims from prison - Yahoo! News Extremist taunts his victims from prison By JAY REEVES, Associated Press Writer Mon May 14, 11:28 PM ET BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - Victims of Eric Rudolph, the anti-abortion extremist who pulled off a series of bombings across the South, say he is taunting them from deep within the nation's most secure federal prison, and authorities say there is little they can do to stop him. Rudolph, who was captured after a five-year manhunt and pleaded guilty in deadly bombings at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and a Birmingham abortion clinic, is serving life in prison at the "Supermax" penitentiary in Florence, Colo. Housed in the most secure part of the prison, he has no computer and little contact with the outside world aside from writing letters. But Rudolph's long essays have been posted on the Internet by a supporter who maintains an Army of God Web site. The Army of God is the same loose-knit group that Rudolph claimed to represent in letters sent after the blasts. In one piece, Rudolph seeks to justify violence against abortion clinics by arguing that Jesus would condone "militant action in defense of the innocent." In another essay about his sentencing, Rudolph mocks former abortion clinic nurse Emily Lyons, who was nearly killed in the 1998 bombing in Birmingham, and her husband, Jeff. He uses pseudonyms rather than naming the couple, but there is no doubt he is describing them. Rudolph recalls how Emily Lyons, in court, described the pain of her injuries and made an obscene gesture at Rudolph as she showed off a finger mangled by the blast. Rudolph writes: "It was a great speech and one that the denizens of freedom should be proud to enshrine in a museum somewhere. Perhaps they could put it next to MLKs `I Have a Dream.' They could call it `I Have a Middle Finger.'" Jeff Lyons said he doesn't often look at the Web site, which has had some items posted for nearly two years. But he said he is worried that Rudolph's messages could incite someone to violence against abortion providers. "He's still sending out harassing communication. He's still hurting us," Lyons said. Diane Derzis, who owns the Birmingham clinic that was bombed, killing a police officer, said someone should stop Rudolph. Bureau of Prisons regulations give wardens the right to reject correspondence by an inmate for "the protection of the public, or if it might facilitate criminal activity." That includes material "which may lead to the use of physical violence." The Bureau of Prisons failed to respond to repeated inquiries from The Associated Press about whether Rudolph's writings violate prison rules. But U.S. Attorney Alice Martin, who helped prosecute Rudolph for the Alabama bombing, said there is nothing the prison can do to restrict Rudolph or the supporter who keeps posting his writings, anti-abortion activist Donald Spitz of Chesapeake, Va. "An inmate does not lose his freedom of speech," she said. Spitz said he corresponds regularly with Rudolph and posts some of his essays because of their shared desire to end abortion. As for those who might be offended, he said, "They don't have to look at it on the Web site." John Hawthorne, whose wife, Alice, was killed in the Olympic bombing, said he isn't bothered by Rudolph's essays. "As far as I'm concerned he's out of sight, out of mind," Hawthorne said. "I don't mind him saying whatever he's going to say as long as they keep him locked up." Supermax has a capacity of 490 and holds some of the nation's most infamous inmates, including Unabomber Theodore Kaczyinski and Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui. A Justice Department report last fall criticized the prison for not properly screening inmate mail. It determined that three men convicted in the World Trade Center bombing were able to send dozens of letters overseas to suspected terrorists. Texas youth prisons suspends 4 more AP via Yahoo!

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/wildfires	Hundreds more flee massive Fla. wildfire - Yahoo! News Hundreds more flee massive Fla. wildfire By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 1:05 PM ET LAKE CITY, Fla. - Authorities evacuated hundreds of homes after a massive wildfire along the Georgia-Florida border jumped a containment line overnight, authorities said Tuesday. Firefighters pushed the flames back to the containment line, but dry weather and 15 mph wind in north Florida was expected to further hinder their work. "If we can just get through today," said Russell Hubright, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman. Between 250 and 500 homes west of U.S. 441 had to be evacuated for a second time when the fire line was breached, Florida Highway Patrol Lt. Michael Burroughs said. An additional 570 people who were ordered out of homes east of the roadway were still waiting to return. The wildfire had raced through the Okefenokee Swamp in southeast Georgia and into northern Florida after being started by lightning more than a week ago. By Tuesday, it had burned 109,000 acres in Florida and 139,813 acres of swampland in Georgia &#151; nearly 390 square miles in all. Flames jumped a containment line at the fire's western edge, but firefighters used bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters to extinguish them, said John Speaks, deputy incident commander with the forest service. The fire was about 1 1/2 miles from U.S. 441. On the western edge of the Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia, Fargo residents were told to stay alert as wind forecast at up to 20 mph pushed the blaze against fire breaks plowed between the swamp and the city of 380 people. "Everybody's being told not to let their guard down, don't unpack," said Laura Polant, a fire information officer in Fargo. "Residents are still being told to be prepared to leave, because the call can come at any time." In Florida, the blaze was 50 percent contained Tuesday. The smoke had lifted enough to open Interstates 10 and 75 to traffic, but drivers were warned that periodic closures were still possible. Another large wildfire, in northeastern Minnesota and Ontario, could be brought under control by the end of the week, officials said. No one has been seriously hurt in the fire, which has burned 117 square miles of Minnesota and Canada, but many cabins and smaller structures &#151; more than 100 in all &#151; have been destroyed. Associated Press writers Russ Bynum in Savannah, Ga., and Jennifer Kay in Miami contributed to this report.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/border_biometrics	AP IMPACT: Laser visas are rarely used - Yahoo! News AP IMPACT: Laser visas are rarely used By ELLIOT SPAGAT, Associated Press Writer SAN DIEGO - The face- and fingerprint-matching technology that has been touted over the past decade as a sophisticated new way to stop terrorists and illegal immigrants from entering the country through Mexico has one major drawback: U.S. border inspectors almost never use it. In fact, the necessary equipment is not even installed in vehicle lanes along the border. Government officials told The Associated Press that checking more people would create too big a backup at the border, where hours-long traffic jams are already common. Some members of Congress who voted for the system in 1996 are complaining they were misled. They said the intent was to use biometrics &#151; or a person's unique physical traits &#151; to screen everyone. "Congress would not have gone to the trouble of requiring biometric features on the border crossing card if it knew the administration would not require that those features be read by scanners," said Rep. Lamar Smith ( ), R-Texas, who wrote the legislation. The U.S. government has spent tens of millions of dollars issuing visa cards digitally embedded with the holder's photo and fingerprints. Holders of the cards come across the border tens of millions of times each year. But on average, in only about 2 percent of those cases are the cardholders screened with the biometric technology to verify their identities and check law-enforcement records, said Paul Morris, Customs and Border Protection's executive director of admissibility requirements and migration control. The checks are done consistently only on the small portion of cardholders who seek permission to travel beyond the border region. "As the technology becomes available, we can expand the current level of biometric matching," Morris said. "There is not a technology solution currently available that will not cause delays that are well beyond the acceptable levels." Beginning in 1998, the high-tech "laser visas" have been issued to 9.1 million Mexicans for short visits to the United States. The laser visas, which look like driver's licenses, have a 1.4-inch optical memory stripe holding personal information such as name, gender and birth date. The stripe also stores the owner's digitized facial photo and two fingerprints. Cardholders coming across the border may be asked to press their fingers against a glass and pose for a photo, while their card pulls up their biometric file &#151; a process that takes an extra 30 seconds or so per person. The photo and fingerprints can also be instantly checked against criminal and terrorist watch lists. The laser visas entitle Mexicans to travel 25 miles from the border &#151; slightly farther in Arizona &#151; for 30 days. Cardholders can also apply for a permit to travel anywhere in the U.S. for up to six months. Border inspectors routinely swipe the laser visas through a machine to retrieve the basic personal information and to call up a photo. But, with some exceptions, the inspectors use the facial- and fingerprint-matching technology only for those applying at the border for one of the six-month permits, Morris said. That practice means that most of those who are checked are not selected at random; they know they are going to be scanned when they come across. The government contract for laser visas was worth $28.6 million from 2000 to 2006, and awarded a five-year renewal in March to General Dynamics Corp. worth $28.5 million, according to Homeland Security. That price tag excludes the cost of opening new consulates to handle the rush of applicants. The State Department established consulates across the border from Laredo, Texas, and Nogales, Ariz. In Tijuana, Mexico, the consulate took over an old gymnasium across town. The 1996 law said anyone presenting a border crossing card "is not permitted to cross over the border into the U.S. unless the biometric identifier contained on the card matches the appropriate biometric characteristics of the alien." But Sandra Raynes, consular officer at the U.S. consulate in Tijuana, said: "If they were to check everyone, you'd have lines all the way down to Cabo San Lucas," about 1,100 miles south of San Diego. U.S. officials said biometrics are only part of its effort to stem illegal crossings. An inspector's wits and agency intelligence are also key, they said. Biometrics "is one tool in our toolbox," said Kelly Klundt, a Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman. Also, the laminated cards have reduced fraud because they are difficult to counterfeit, officials said. Older visas looked like crumpled library cards, some dating to the 1950s. Authorities said women in their 60s used cards with photographs of teenage girls because the cards had no expiration dates. Former Rep. Jim Kolbe, a Republican who left Congress in January after 22 years representing a district on the Arizona border, said lawmakers expected checks on all cardholders, though there was no timetable. "We definitely intended to go further with it than we have," he said. "Ten years later, it seems incredible that we've only gotten this far with it." The 14 pedestrian booths at San Ysidro, the nation's busiest border crossing by far, are equipped with fingerprint glass but no cameras. But that glass is not used on the 30,000 people who walk though daily. There is neither type of equipment in the 24 vehicle lanes, which handle about 35,000 cars and 250 buses a day. Applicants for the six-month permits are asked to pull aside into a small parking lot, get out and walk up to a booth, where they are fingerprinted and photographed for verification. Initially, border crossings did not even have equipment to lift personal information off the cards, let alone the biometric data. Jeffrey Davidow, U.S. ambassador to Mexico from 1998 to 2001, recalls members of Congress visiting the border to see the machines, which were never used when the lawmakers were gone. "I'd tell them that it was all show, that it doesn't work, that the card is not doing what it's supposed to do," Davidow said. He said his warnings elicited shrugs. There were also technological setbacks. Equipment to verify photos and fingerprints often failed to read through sweat, scratches and other wallet "crud," according to an internal Homeland Security report. A test at five Texas crossings in the spring of 2004 showed that 731 out of 1,740 cards, or 42 percent, were unreadable, according to the report, which was provided to The Associated Press by someone who insisted on anonymity because the government did not authorize its release. Homeland Security officials did not have more recent figures on how many cards are correctly read. But they said technical problems have been resolved.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/border_biometrics	AP IMPACT: Laser visas are rarely used - Yahoo! News AP IMPACT: Laser visas are rarely used By ELLIOT SPAGAT, Associated Press Writer SAN DIEGO - The face- and fingerprint-matching technology that has been touted over the past decade as a sophisticated new way to stop terrorists and illegal immigrants from entering the country through Mexico has one major drawback: U.S. border inspectors almost never use it. In fact, the necessary equipment is not even installed in vehicle lanes along the border. Government officials told The Associated Press that checking more people would create too big a backup at the border, where hours-long traffic jams are already common. Some members of Congress who voted for the system in 1996 are complaining they were misled. They said the intent was to use biometrics &#151; or a person's unique physical traits &#151; to screen everyone. "Congress would not have gone to the trouble of requiring biometric features on the border crossing card if it knew the administration would not require that those features be read by scanners," said Rep. Lamar Smith ( ), R-Texas, who wrote the legislation. The U.S. government has spent tens of millions of dollars issuing visa cards digitally embedded with the holder's photo and fingerprints. Holders of the cards come across the border tens of millions of times each year. But on average, in only about 2 percent of those cases are the cardholders screened with the biometric technology to verify their identities and check law-enforcement records, said Paul Morris, Customs and Border Protection's executive director of admissibility requirements and migration control. The checks are done consistently only on the small portion of cardholders who seek permission to travel beyond the border region. "As the technology becomes available, we can expand the current level of biometric matching," Morris said. "There is not a technology solution currently available that will not cause delays that are well beyond the acceptable levels." Beginning in 1998, the high-tech "laser visas" have been issued to 9.1 million Mexicans for short visits to the United States. The laser visas, which look like driver's licenses, have a 1.4-inch optical memory stripe holding personal information such as name, gender and birth date. The stripe also stores the owner's digitized facial photo and two fingerprints. Cardholders coming across the border may be asked to press their fingers against a glass and pose for a photo, while their card pulls up their biometric file &#151; a process that takes an extra 30 seconds or so per person. The photo and fingerprints can also be instantly checked against criminal and terrorist watch lists. The laser visas entitle Mexicans to travel 25 miles from the border &#151; slightly farther in Arizona &#151; for 30 days. Cardholders can also apply for a permit to travel anywhere in the U.S. for up to six months. Border inspectors routinely swipe the laser visas through a machine to retrieve the basic personal information and to call up a photo. But, with some exceptions, the inspectors use the facial- and fingerprint-matching technology only for those applying at the border for one of the six-month permits, Morris said. That practice means that most of those who are checked are not selected at random; they know they are going to be scanned when they come across.

News CIA agent testifies at Padilla trial By CURT ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer MIAMI - A covert officer who was permitted to testify wearing a disguise and using an alias described in court Tuesday how U.S. officials in obtained a truckload of al-Qaida documents, including a form later linked to suspected operative Jose Padilla. The officer, whose true identity is classified, gave his name as Tom Langston. He appeared in court with a beard and glasses, although the nature of the disguise was not obvious or made public. Prosecutors declined to say whether any concealment was even used. The arrangement was approved by U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke at the request of the CIA, which sought to protect the officer's ability to continue doing clandestine work overseas. It was not disclosed to the jury. Langston testified that he was working in December 2001 at a classified CIA site in Kandahar, Afghanistan, when an Afghan man driving a pickup truck showed up with thousands of pages of documents. Among them was a bright blue binder containing what appeared to be dozens of forms in Arabic, one of which reportedly turned out to be Padilla's. Prosecutors say his fingerprints are on the "mujahedeen data form," which had questions on language skills, military experience, religious education and other areas. The form is crucial to the government's case because it could link Padilla and his two suspected co-conspirators &#151; Adham Amin Hassoun and Kifah Wael Jayyousi &#151; to al-Qaida. The three are charged with being part of a U.S.-based support cell for Islamic extremists around the world, including al-Qaida. The unidentified Afghan man, Langston said, was affiliated with an Afghan tribal leader opposed to the country's Islamic fundamentalist Taliban rulers, who were then battling U.S. forces. Under the Taliban, al-Qaida had established terrorist training camps in Afghanistan in the years leading to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. "He was loyal to some individuals who were cooperating with us against the Taliban and the terrorist element," the CIA officer said. The Afghan man told the CIA he collected the documents from a house occupied by Arabs who had fled shortly before the 2001 U.S. invasion and were known locally to be affiliated with al-Qaida. Langston said the man was not paid or given any other benefit by U.S. officials for the documents, although he was prohibited after prosecutors objected from answering questions about whether the man's tribal leader was compensated. "I think he took this initiative on his own," the CIA officer said of the man who brought the documents. At one point, Langston grew reluctant to answer a question from Padilla attorney Orlando do Campo about how CIA officers and analysts handle documents such as those in the binder. "I'm a little uncomfortable answering the question because it gets into methods. I'm sworn to protect sources and methods," he said. The binder and other documents were kept in a locked room at the CIA installation in Kandahar, then placed in boxes and taken on U.S. vehicles and aircraft to the in Islamabad, Pakistan. The binder was in a box labeled "vegetable oil," the CIA officer said. The FBI legal attache there in late 2001, Jennifer Keenan, testified Tuesday that she remembered the binder among 22 boxes, trunks and other containers because it appeared to hold information important for U.S. counterterrorism investigators. "We were very grateful to find this," Keenan said. "I called it a pledge form. It says pledge on it." It wasn't until later that the FBI in Washington was able to link one of the forms to Padilla, who allegedly filled it out under the name Abu Abdullah al-Mujahir in July 2000. A key to making that link was information gathered during U.S. interrogations of other suspected al-Qaida figures, according to documents filed in the Padilla case. Testimony will resume Thursday. Prosecutors say their witnesses will include Yahya Goba, a member of the "Lackawanna Six" group of men who pleaded guilty in 2003 in New York to attending al-Qaida camps. Goba, who received a 10-year prison sentence, will testify that he attended the same camp as Padilla and filled out an identical form, prosecutor Brian Frazier said. Padilla, a 36-year-old former Chicago gang member and U.S. citizen, was arrested by the FBI in May 2002 when he arrived at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The Bush administration initially accused him of plotting to detonate a radioactive "dirty bomb" in a U.S. city, but those allegations are not part of the criminal indictment. Padilla was added to the Miami case after 3 1/2 years in military custody as an enemy combatant. His case was the subject of a lengthy legal battle over the president's wartime detention powers over U.S. citizens. Padilla and his two co-defendants face up to life in prison if convicted of all charges.

News UT-Austin fires financial aid chief By LIZ AUSTIN PETERSON, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 10:44 AM ET AUSTIN, Texas - The University of Texas at Austin fired its financial aid director after determining he had owned stock in a loan company in violation of university rules. Associate Vice President Lawrence Burt has been on paid leave since early last month, when he was named in a New York attorney general's investigation into the $85 billion student loan industry. Burt has denied wrongdoing. He did not return a telephone call seeking comment after his firing Monday. A University of Texas System investigation found that Burt placed a subsidiary of the loan company at the top of several preferred lender lists without any apparent justification. The subsidiary, Student Loan Xpress, trailed many other companies in volume, customer service and default rates, the investigation found. But it was among the lenders that offered the most benefits to financial aid staff, including happy hours. Burt owned 2,300 shares in Education Lending Group Inc., the former parent company of Student Loan Xpress, the investigation by UT System General Counsel Barry Burgdorf found. That includes 1,500 shares he bought from a friend shortly before adding the lender to the preferred list. Burgdorf found no direct evidence that Burt accepted the stock in exchange for adding Student Loan Xpress to the list. "Nevertheless, the timing of the transaction in relation to Student Loan Xpress' inclusion on ... lender lists raises suspicion and, at least, creates the appearance of impropriety," Burgdorf said in his report. Burt should have sold the stock or at least disclosed that he owned it and recused himself from any decisions about Student Loan Xpress, Burgdorf said. Burt sold the stock in 2005 for at least $18,000. When the investigation began last month, Burt said his previous ownership of the shares had no connection to Student Loan Xpress's position on the preferred lender list. "They are on our lender list for the same reason the other 19 are on the list. They provide the best package of benefits to students," he said. Burgdorf said the preferred lender list was flawed because Burt alone had the authority to add or remove companies and he often did so with little or no explanation. He recommended that the university establish objective criteria for the list and that managers be required to disclose their relationships with any entities involved in the student lending industry. Charles A. Sorber, former president of the University of Texas of the Permian Basin, was named interim director of the financial aid office starting May 29.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/katrina_opportunity	New Orleans neighborhood rescues itself - Yahoo! News New Orleans neighborhood rescues itself By JOHN MORENO GONZALES, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 2:09 PM ET NEW ORLEANS - Paul Pablovich was the very picture of a good neighbor as he shoveled debris off the curb and mowed other people's lawns in Lakeview, a middle-class section of town that was swamped with 15 feet of water during Hurricane Katrina and is now a patchwork of gutted and newly built homes. But he wasn't doing it entirely out of the goodness of his heart. He was protecting his investment. Pablovich, an entrepreneur who lived in a different part of New Orleans before Katrina, bought a bungalow on the street from an elderly resident after the storm, renovated it and plans to live there with his fiancee. He purchased a second abandoned house for $107,000, fixed it up and hopes to resell it for $214,000. He would like to "flip" several other properties on the block, too. The way he sees it, capitalism is the road to recovery for Lakeview. "It's how the country was built," Pablovich, 38, said of the $600,000 he has pumped into the real estate market. "Free-market economics will kick in." Lakeview, a 7,000-home mostly white enclave in a city that is predominantly black, has emerged as a success story in the reconstruction of New Orleans through entrepreneurs like Pablovich and strong civic organization that existed long before the storm. In contrast, hard-hit black middle-class neighborhoods in eastern New Orleans do not have the same financial means and civic organization, and are not drawing nearly as much private investment. As a result, their recovery is crawling. "If you're going to speculate, you're much more likely to speculate in Lakeview than you would in the east," said Louisiana State University sociology professor Jeanne Hulbert. "But you could end up, potentially, with a social and economic structure in the city that really carves out the black middle class." Nearly 21 months after Katrina, Lakeview has lights and other utilities, but still has no firehouse and no public school. But it is a community so fiercely independent it tried in the 1990s to secede from the city. And its residents &#151; who include business executives and other professionals &#151; have considerable organizational skills. Lakeview's churches arranged for volunteers around the country to plant trees along Canal Boulevard, the main drag. And recently, nearly 1,000 original and potential new residents came to a civic association tutorial on how to navigate the city's bureaucracy and find a reputable contractor. In fact, the civic association drew up a list of recommended contractors by running credit checks on them and consulting the Better Business Bureau. The group is so organized it has compiled its own data on rebuilding, finding in a February survey that 67 percent of Lakeview's lots were in some stage of transformation. Seventeen percent were newly inhabited, just over 26 percent were under repair, and 23 percent had been demolished to pave the way for rebuilding. In contrast, neighborhood leaders in eastern New Orleans, which encompasses four ZIP codes to Lakeview's one, are just now undertaking a house-to-house count. Independent research, at first glance, suggests Lakeview and eastern New Orleans have rebuilt at similar rates. GCR and Associates Inc. found last week that based on utility hookups, close to 36 percent of residents in the Lakeview ZIP code were back, versus 33 percent in the eastern New Orleans ZIP codes. However, Richard Campanella, associate director of Tulane and Xavier universities' Center for Biomedical Research, found that the flooding in Lakeview was, by some measures, far more severe. For example, nearly 22 percent of homes in Lakeview got more than 8 feet of water, compared with 3.5 percent in eastern New Orleans. Lakeview has eclipsed eastern New Orleans in real estate sales since Katrina. Sixty-nine houses were sold there nine months before the disaster, compared with 147 during the past nine months of recovery, a 113 percent jump. In eastern New Orleans, 215 single-family homes were sold in the nine months before Katrina, and 287 during the past nine months, a 33 percent increase. As he painted over the rust on an iron fence that ringed his family's home in eastern New Orleans, Hank Long said it was obvious to him that his part of town was rebuilding with sweat equity more often than financial equity. "In Lakeview, many of those houses were already paid for. A lot of people are still paying their mortgages here," said Long, a 60-year-old black man. "Nobody has big money here. They gutted out their house, and that's as far as they got. Whatever they could do, they did on their own." Hulbert of LSU said: "You have to remember the black middle class only took hold in the 1960s. That is different from several generations of middle-class life. Many middle-class blacks in New Orleans were the first in their families to go to college, and it appears many had their entire savings tied up in their homes." David Bell, president of the East New Orleans Neighborhood Advisory Commission, which formed in March to bind together 15 area groups, said a lack of private investment means eastern New Orleans is much more dependent on government recovery aid, with all the bureaucracy and politics that entails. For example, a centerpiece of the eastern New Orleans redevelopment plan is a proposed $100 million shopping strip. But federal grants for the project will not be fully released until the city comes up with 10 percent. Back in Lakeview, residents like to say that they ask mostly one thing of the city: for it to get out of the way. TKTMJ Inc., a builder that is selling modular homes in the neighborhood, found the area so profitable that it established an office in Lakeview and has dubbed one of its designs "The Lakeview." Tommy Callia, a sales representative with the company, noted that most of those able to rebuild are middle class and white. "I think we're not going to be as diverse as we once were, and that's going to be sad," he said. "You can say it's a little like a gumbo: If you don't have all the ingredients, something is missing in the taste."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/eric_rudolph	Extremist taunts his victims from prison - Yahoo! News Extremist taunts his victims from prison By JAY REEVES, Associated Press Writer Mon May 14, 11:28 PM ET BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - Victims of Eric Rudolph, the anti-abortion extremist who pulled off a series of bombings across the South, say he is taunting them from deep within the nation's most secure federal prison, and authorities say there is little they can do to stop him. Rudolph, who was captured after a five-year manhunt and pleaded guilty in deadly bombings at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and a Birmingham abortion clinic, is serving life in prison at the "Supermax" penitentiary in Florence, Colo. Housed in the most secure part of the prison, he has no computer and little contact with the outside world aside from writing letters. But Rudolph's long essays have been posted on the Internet by a supporter who maintains an Army of God Web site. The Army of God is the same loose-knit group that Rudolph claimed to represent in letters sent after the blasts. In one piece, Rudolph seeks to justify violence against abortion clinics by arguing that Jesus would condone "militant action in defense of the innocent." In another essay about his sentencing, Rudolph mocks former abortion clinic nurse Emily Lyons, who was nearly killed in the 1998 bombing in Birmingham, and her husband, Jeff. He uses pseudonyms rather than naming the couple, but there is no doubt he is describing them. Rudolph recalls how Emily Lyons, in court, described the pain of her injuries and made an obscene gesture at Rudolph as she showed off a finger mangled by the blast. Rudolph writes: "It was a great speech and one that the denizens of freedom should be proud to enshrine in a museum somewhere. Perhaps they could put it next to MLKs `I Have a Dream.' They could call it `I Have a Middle Finger.'" Jeff Lyons said he doesn't often look at the Web site, which has had some items posted for nearly two years. But he said he is worried that Rudolph's messages could incite someone to violence against abortion providers. "He's still sending out harassing communication. He's still hurting us," Lyons said. Diane Derzis, who owns the Birmingham clinic that was bombed, killing a police officer, said someone should stop Rudolph. Bureau of Prisons regulations give wardens the right to reject correspondence by an inmate for "the protection of the public, or if it might facilitate criminal activity." That includes material "which may lead to the use of physical violence." The Bureau of Prisons failed to respond to repeated inquiries from The Associated Press about whether Rudolph's writings violate prison rules. But U.S. Attorney Alice Martin, who helped prosecute Rudolph for the Alabama bombing, said there is nothing the prison can do to restrict Rudolph or the supporter who keeps posting his writings, anti-abortion activist Donald Spitz of Chesapeake, Va. "An inmate does not lose his freedom of speech," she said. Spitz said he corresponds regularly with Rudolph and posts some of his essays because of their shared desire to end abortion. As for those who might be offended, he said, "They don't have to look at it on the Web site." John Hawthorne, whose wife, Alice, was killed in the Olympic bombing, said he isn't bothered by Rudolph's essays. "As far as I'm concerned he's out of sight, out of mind," Hawthorne said. "I don't mind him saying whatever he's going to say as long as they keep him locked up." Supermax has a capacity of 490 and holds some of the nation's most infamous inmates, including Unabomber Theodore Kaczyinski and Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui. A Justice Department report last fall criticized the prison for not properly screening inmate mail. It determined that three men convicted in the World Trade Center bombing were able to send dozens of letters overseas to suspected terrorists. Texas youth prisons suspends 4 more AP via Yahoo!

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/wallace_shooting_anniversary	Memory of Gov. Wallace shooting fades - Yahoo! News Memory of Gov. Wallace shooting fades By BEN EVANS, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 9:30 AM ET LAUREL, Md. - Many of Laurel's older residents can point to the precise spot in the shopping center where Arthur Bremer's gunshots paralyzed Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace and cut short his campaign for the White House in 1972. They recall just what they were doing that May 15 afternoon when they heard that the loner from Milwaukee had shot Wallace five times as he shook hands in the parking lot of what was then the city's main retail plaza. But 35 years later, as Laurel struggles to retain its small-town identity, the collective memory of its most famous event is fading. "People say it happened over near the bank, but other people say it was over there" by the drug store, said Scott Branch, standing behind the counter of the Hobby Works store he manages in the Laurel Shopping Center. Branch said he frequently uses the shooting as a landmark in giving directions to the store. But with the younger set, "I tell them it's where the Books-A-Million is and they say, 'Oh, I know where that is.'" Wallace, who had carried five Southern states as a fist-shaking third party candidate in 1968, was mounting a surprisingly successful run in the Democratic primaries in 1972 before Laurel. Billing himself as the candidate of "the average American," he was viewed as a serious wild card in the party and in Republican President 's bid for re-election. A former segregationist, Wallace was best known for standing defiantly at the all-white University of Alabama in a symbolic face-off with the Justice Department as the National Guard stood by and two black students enrolled in 1963. By 1972, he had tempered his racist rhetoric and adopted a more subtle approach, denouncing federal courts over the "involuntary busing" of schoolchildren to meet desegregation orders and pledging a return to a "law and order" society. Wallace had consistently fared well in polls and a few weeks before Laurel had led the crowded Democratic field in the presidential primary in Florida, where he carried every county. Even as he lay in the hospital after the assassination attempt, he led in Maryland and Michigan. But the shooting effectively ended his national career, diminishing the fiery charisma that had made him a dominant political force in Alabama and leaving him in a wheelchair until his death in 1998. There has never been much discussion of erecting a public marker on the site, city spokesman Jim Collins said. Even though Wallace ultimately apologized and asked forgiveness for his segregationist stands, a memorial would probably meet opposition because of his past, Collins said. Views might be different had Wallace died at the site, he said. Memorials are more common at sites where historical figures died, such as John F. Kennedy in Dallas or the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis. There is no marker, for example, at the Washington hotel where President Reagan was wounded in a 1981 shooting. Michael Brey, who owns the Hobby Works store, said a simple marker might be appropriate. But he said it could be tricky. "How do you do it without making it seem like it's a monument to a man who stood out in front of a school blocking black children from attending?" he said. Today, Laurel hardly resembles the small mill town it once was. Growth from the nation's capital about 20 miles to the south has surrounded the city with suburbs, and a busy commercial district with fast-food restaurants and car dealerships now dwarfs the strip center where Wallace was shot. No one seems to know what happened to the wooden stage that the shopping center would roll out for community events and that Wallace stood upon to deliver his stump speech before wading into the crowd. The bank that sits alone in the middle of the parking lot &#151; and is closest to the shooting site &#151; once displayed a large photograph of the scene in the lobby. But the national chain that bought the bank took it down years ago. "I heard about it when I first opened my account," said 20-year Laurel resident Dianne W. Shields as she left the bank recently. "They had (the photo) posted right there in front. You couldn't miss it ... everybody would talk about it." Wallace's family has never considered requesting a marker at the site, said Wallace's son, George Wallace Jr., a former Alabama Public Service commissioner who lost a bid to become lieutenant governor last year. If the local community wanted one, the family wouldn't object, he said. But it isn't planning to get involved. "Time passes, memories fade. It's part of life," he said. "It is a very historic site though. It sure is." (This version CORRECTS spelling of Brey.)

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/climate_summit	World mayors hold climate summit in NYC - Yahoo! News World mayors hold climate summit in NYC By SARA KUGLER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 12:18 PM ET NEW YORK - City leaders from around the globe gathered Tuesday for an environmental summit hosted by former and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg with a message that the campaign to reverse global warming begins with the world's mayors. "It is in cities that the battle to tackle climate change will be won or lost," London Mayor Ken Livingstone said. Mayors and local leaders from more than 30 cities kicked off the conference, known as the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit, which first met in 2005 in London. Organizers say cities bear a significant responsibility to address climate change because they cover less than 1 percent of the Earth's surface but generate 80 percent of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. "Our theme is not whether we should work together, because we know that we must, it is how and how fast we can do so," New York's Deputy Mayor Dan Doctoroff said. The summit includes mayors from Seoul to Sao Paulo, Albuquerque to Addis Ababa. The meeting comes at a time when many countries are struggling to address global and national standards for carbon reduction. This week, U.N. delegates are meeting in Germany to gear up for December negotiations on a new set of international rules for controlling greenhouse gas emissions. The new accord would succeed the Kyoto Protocol, which ends in 2012. When the Group of Eight major industrialized countries &#151; the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and Russia &#151; met in Germany in June, climate change will also be on the agenda. Meanwhile, the mayors said Tuesday, local governments can't wait around. "Where national governments can't or won't lead, cities will," Toronto Mayor David Miller said. In a discussion on transportation, the mayor of the Brazilian city of Curitiba described his city's solutions, which include a Bus Rapid Transit system, while Livingstone described London's program to reduce traffic by charging motorists extra money in the city center. Bloomberg recently announced his intention to begin a similar traffic charging program in Manhattan. London traffic congestion dropped by 20 percent, and carbon emissions in the central zone similarly decreased, Livingstone said. The fee &#151; equal to about $16 &#151; has gone up since it started in 2003. "People may not like paying the 5 pounds a day, but they certainly didn't want to live with that style of congestion," Livingstone said. He said his city's next goal is to charge more for higher-polluting cars, a pricing scale that could mean a $50 equivalent charge for the worst offenders. Organizers of the conference, which ends Thursday, also invited a number of business leaders to this year's gathering in an effort to involve the private sector. They hope to convince companies that going green &#151; through innovative construction, transportation alternatives and other environmental changes &#151; is a profitable economic move.

"People may not like paying the 5 pounds a day, but they certainly didn't want to live with that style of congestion," Livingstone said. He said his city's next goal is to charge more for higher-polluting cars, a pricing scale that could mean a $50 equivalent charge for the worst offenders. Organizers of the conference, which ends Thursday, also invited a number of business leaders to this year's gathering in an effort to involve the private sector. They hope to convince companies that going green &#151; through innovative construction, transportation alternatives and other environmental changes &#151; is a profitable economic move.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/student_loan_probe_texas	UT-Austin fires financial aid chief - Yahoo! News UT-Austin fires financial aid chief By LIZ AUSTIN PETERSON, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 10:44 AM ET AUSTIN, Texas - The University of Texas at Austin fired its financial aid director after determining he had owned stock in a loan company in violation of university rules. Associate Vice President Lawrence Burt has been on paid leave since early last month, when he was named in a New York attorney general's investigation into the $85 billion student loan industry. Burt has denied wrongdoing. He did not return a telephone call seeking comment after his firing Monday. A University of Texas System investigation found that Burt placed a subsidiary of the loan company at the top of several preferred lender lists without any apparent justification. The subsidiary, Student Loan Xpress, trailed many other companies in volume, customer service and default rates, the investigation found. But it was among the lenders that offered the most benefits to financial aid staff, including happy hours. Burt owned 2,300 shares in Education Lending Group Inc., the former parent company of Student Loan Xpress, the investigation by UT System General Counsel Barry Burgdorf found. That includes 1,500 shares he bought from a friend shortly before adding the lender to the preferred list. Burgdorf found no direct evidence that Burt accepted the stock in exchange for adding Student Loan Xpress to the list. "Nevertheless, the timing of the transaction in relation to Student Loan Xpress' inclusion on ... lender lists raises suspicion and, at least, creates the appearance of impropriety," Burgdorf said in his report. Burt should have sold the stock or at least disclosed that he owned it and recused himself from any decisions about Student Loan Xpress, Burgdorf said. Burt sold the stock in 2005 for at least $18,000. When the investigation began last month, Burt said his previous ownership of the shares had no connection to Student Loan Xpress's position on the preferred lender list. "They are on our lender list for the same reason the other 19 are on the list. They provide the best package of benefits to students," he said. Burgdorf said the preferred lender list was flawed because Burt alone had the authority to add or remove companies and he often did so with little or no explanation. He recommended that the university establish objective criteria for the list and that managers be required to disclose their relationships with any entities involved in the student lending industry.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/cruise_ship_aground	Cruise ship runs aground off Alaska - Yahoo! News Cruise ship runs aground off Alaska By ANNE SUTTON, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 5:11 AM ET JUNEAU, Alaska - When the Empress of the North ran aground, the band played on &#151; as everyone disembarked in a safe and orderly fashion. Passengers jolted awake by the ship hitting a charted reef 50 miles southwest of Juneau early Monday were ordered to don lifejackets and gather in the ballroom, where a singer and piano player entertained them with songs including "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" as they waited for rescue. Passengers praised the ship's crew for taking charge. "They just seemed to know what they were doing. They were caring, courteous, the whole thing, and I think that's what kept everybody calm," said Mary Crosby, 83, of Seattle. National Transportation Safety Board National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the grounding of the riverboat-style cruise ship, which had 206 passengers and 75 crew members on board. One person was taken to a hospital for observation, a Juneau city official said. When Coast Guard helicopters reached the area, the vessel was listing at the southern end of Icy Strait and had begun taking on water, the Coast Guard said. As the ship's pumps worked to remove the water, the passengers were transferred safely to other boats in the area and then to an Alaska state ferry to be taken to Juneau. The Empress of the North floated free of the rock during the evacuation, and the crew was able to stabilize the ship, said the Coast Guard. The ship arrived in Juneau with a Coast Guard escort about nine hours after the grounding. The ferry Columbia arrived shortly after. State officials said the hull sustained significant damage and an empty fuel tank was breached during the grounding. A light oil sheen was seen in the area but officials were uncertain if the ship was the source. Coast Guard Petty Officer Barry Lane said Coast Guard inspectors did an initial survey of the ship as it was moored in Juneau's Auke Bay and will pass the information on to the NTSB. It wasn't immediately clear why the cruise ship ran aground, said Coast Guard officials. It was drizzling in Juneau but the seas were calm. Good Samaritans were first on the scene of the grounding and passengers were initially evacuated onto lifeboats, a charter fishing boat, a tugboat, another small cruise ship and a coast guard cutter before the Columbia arrived. "The morning was incredible. You had anybody and everybody that could get there and they all got there as quick as they could and all were willing to help out," said Coast Guard Capt. Mark Guillory, federal on-scene coordinator. Passengers left the ship with only their personal identification and medications. They were to be reunited with their belongings later in Juneau. All had been flown to Seattle by evening, said company officials. "It couldn't have been better orchestrated the way things fell into place," said Chief Petty Officer Barry Lane. The Empress of the North is operated by Majestic America Line of Seattle. The ship has 112 staterooms, a three-story paddlewheel and galleries featuring Native American masks and Russian artwork, including Faberge eggs, according to its Web site. The 360-foot ship is less than half the size of the average cruise ship in the Caribbean, and is also dwarfed by most cruise other ships off the Alaska coast. The grounding occurred on the second day of a seven-day cruise, said Dan Miller, a spokesman for Majestic America. The American-built ship is billed by the company as the only overnight paddlewheel vessel in use on Alaska cruises. It also is used on cruises on the Columbia River between Washington state and Oregon. The Empress of the North has had other problems since it began operating in mid-2003. In October of that year, it hit a navigation lock on the Snake River in Washington. It has also run aground at least twice before &#151; once after developing steering problems on the Columbia River, and once on a sandbar near Washougal, Wash., as it tried to avoid a barge.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/jerry_falwell	TV evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 - Yahoo! News TV evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73 By SUE LINDSEY, Associated Press Writer LYNCHBURG, Va. - The Rev. Jerry Falwell was stricken at his campus office and died Tuesday after a career in which the evangelist used the power of television to transform the religious right into a mighty force in American politics. He was 73. The founder of the Moral Majority was discovered without a pulse at Liberty University and pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later. Dr. Carl Moore, Falwell's physician, said he had a heart condition and presumably died of a heart rhythm abnormality. Driven into politics by the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that established the right to an abortion, Falwell founded the Moral Majority in 1979. One of the conservative lobbying group's greatest triumphs came just a year later, when Falwell credited the Moral Majority with getting millions of conservative voters registered, aiding in Reagan's victory and giving Republicans control of the Senate. "I shudder to think where the country would be right now if the religious right had not evolved," he said when he stepped down as Moral Majority president in 1987. Fellow TV evangelist Pat Robertson, himself a one-time GOP candidate for president, declared Falwell "a tower of strength on many of the moral issues which have confronted our nation." The rise of Christian conservatism &#151; and the Moral Majority's full-throated condemnation of homosexuality, abortion and pornography &#151; made Falwell perhaps the most recognizable figure on the evangelical right, and one of the most controversial ones, too. Over the years, Falwell waged a landmark libel case against Hustler magazine founder Larry Flynt over a raunchy parody ad, and created a furor in 1999 when one of his publications suggested that the purse-carrying "Teletubbies" character Tinky Winky was gay. Matt Foreman, executive director of National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, extended condolences to those close to Falwell, but added: "Unfortunately, we will always remember him as a founder and leader of America's anti-gay industry, someone who exacerbated the nation's appalling response to the onslaught of the epidemic, someone who demonized and vilified us for political gain and someone who used religion to divide rather than unite our nation." The 1980s marked the religious conservative movement's high-water mark. In more recent years, Falwell had become a problematic figure for the GOP. His remarks a few days after Sept. 11, 2001, essentially blaming feminists, gays and liberals for bringing on the terrorist attacks drew a rebuke from the White House, and he apologized. Falwell's declining political star seemed apparent when he was quietly led in and out of the Republican Party's 2004 national convention. Just four years earlier, he was invited to pray from the rostrum. The big, blue-eyed preacher with a booming voice started a fundamentalist church in an abandoned bottling plant in Lynchburg in 1956 with just 35 members. He built it into a religious empire that included the 24,000-member Thomas Road Baptist Church, the "Old Time Gospel Hour" carried on TV stations around the country and 9,600-student Liberty University, which Falwell founded in 1971 as Lynchburg Baptist College. From his living room, he broadcast his message of salvation and raised the donations that helped his ministry grow. "He was one of the first to come up with ways to use television to expand his ministry," said Robert Alley, a retired University of Richmond religion professor who studied and criticized Falwell's career. Alley died last summer. Falwell had once opposed mixing preaching with politics, but changed his views. The Moral Majority grew to 6.5 million members and raised $69 million as it supported conservative politicians and railed against abortion, homosexuality, pornography and bans on school prayer. Falwell became the face of the religious right, appearing on national magazine covers and on talk shows. In 1983, U.S. News & World Report named him one of 25 most influential people in America. "Jerry's passions and convictions changed the course of our country for the better over the last 20 years," said James Dobson, founder of the conservative Christian Focus on the Family ministry. "It was Jerry who led an entire wing of Christianity, the fundamentalist wing, away from isolation and into a direct confrontation with the culture." "Dr. Falwell was a man of distinguished accomplishment who devoted his life to serving his faith and country," said Sen. John McCain ( ), a GOP presidential contender who during the 2000 primaries referred to Falwell and Robertson as "agents of intolerance." McCain has since distanced himself from those comments. In 1984, Falwell sued Hustler for $45 million, charging that he was libeled by an liquor-ad parody that quoted him as saying he lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse. A federal jury found the fake ad did not libel him, but awarded him $200,000 for emotional distress. The verdict was overturned in a landmark 1988 decision that held that even pornographic spoofs about a public figure enjoy First Amendment protection. With Falwell's high profile came frequent criticism, even from fellow ministers. The Rev. Billy Graham once rebuked him for political sermonizing on "non-moral issues." Falwell quit the Moral Majority in 1987, saying he was tired of being "a lightning rod" and wanted to devote his time to his ministry and Liberty University. But he remained outspoken and continued to draw criticism for his remarks. In 1999, he told an evangelical conference that the Antichrist was a male Jew who was probably already alive. Falwell later apologized for the remark but not for holding the belief. A month later, his National Liberty Journal warned parents that Tinky Winky, the children's TV character, was a gay role model and morally damaging to children. Falwell was re-energized after family values proved important in the 2004 presidential election. He formed the Faith and Values Coalition as the "21st Century resurrection of the Moral Majority," to seek anti-abortion judges, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and more conservative elected officials. In 1987, Falwell took over the PTL (Praise the Lord) ministry in South Carolina after the Rev. Jim Bakker got caught in a sex and money scandal. Falwell slid fully clothed down a theme park water slide after donors met his fundraising goal to help rescue the rival ministry. He gave it up seven months later after learning the depth of PTL's financial problems. Largely because of the sex scandals involving Bakker and fellow evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, donations to Falwell's ministry dropped from $135 million in 1986 to less than $100 million the following year. Hundreds of workers were laid off and viewers of his television show dwindled. Liberty University was $73 million in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy, and his "Old Time Gospel Hour" was $16 million in debt. By the mid-1990s, two local businessmen with long ties to Falwell began overseeing the finances and helped get companies to forgive debts or write them off. Falwell dreamed that Liberty would grow to 50,000 students and be to fundamentalist Christians what Notre Dame is to Roman Catholics and Brigham Young University is to Mormons. Falwell's father and his grandfather were militant atheists, he wrote in his autobiography. He said his father made a fortune off his businesses &#151; including bootlegging during Prohibition. As a student, Falwell was a star athlete and a prankster who was barred from giving his high school valedictorian's speech after he was caught using counterfeit lunch tickets. He ran with a gang of juvenile delinquents before becoming a born-again Christian at 19. He turned down an offer to play professional baseball and transferred from Lynchburg College to Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Mo. "My heart was burning to serve Christ," he once said in an interview. "I knew nothing would ever be the same again." Falwell had made careful preparations for a transition of his leadership to his two sons, Jerry Falwell, Jr., now vice chancellor of Liberty University, and Jonathan Falwell, executive the pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church. Falwell is survived by his wife, Macel, his two sons and a daughter, Jeannie Falwell Savas. Funeral arrangements were not immediately known. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Mormon whose own faith has become an issue during his run for the presidency, said Falwell "built and led a movement based on strong principles and strong faith," and "the legacy of his important work will continue through his many ministries where he put his faith into action."

News Groups: Block Texas town's immigrant ban By ANABELLE GARAY, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 2:45 PM ET DALLAS - Latino activists and civil liberties advocates asked a federal judge Tuesday to block a voter-approved ordinance that prohibits landlords from renting apartments to most illegal immigrants in the Dallas suburb of Farmers Branch. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union American Civil Liberties Union , which have already sued the city, requested the temporary restraining order in U.S. District Court. The ordinance, scheduled to take effect next Tuesday, requires apartment managers to verify that renters are U.S. citizens or legal immigrants before leasing to them, with some exceptions. Violators face fines of up to $500. "It is unfortunate that the residents of Farmers Branch have chosen to implement a law which is not only bad policy, but is likely also unconstitutional," said Lisa Graybill, legal director for the ACLU of Texas. "Now the issue will have to be resolved in federal court." The city is preparing a response to the request, said Matthew Boyle, an attorney representing Farmers Branch. City council members first approved the ban in November without discussion, then revised it in January to include exemptions for minors, seniors and some mixed-status families. On Saturday, residents voted to approve the ban with 68 percent of voters in favor, according to unofficial results. Councilman Tim O'Hare, the ordinance's lead proponent, contends the city's economy and quality of life will improve if illegal immigrants are kept out. O'Hare declined to comment Tuesday. Since 1970, Farmers Branch has changed from a small, predominantly white bedroom community with a declining population to a city of almost 28,000 people, about 37 percent of them Hispanic, according to the U.S. Farmers Branch already faces four lawsuits brought by civil rights groups, residents, property owners and businesses, who say the ordinance discriminates and puts landlords in the precarious position of acting as federal immigration officers. Their attorneys argue the ordinance attempts to regulate immigration, a duty that is exclusively the federal government's. Nationwide, more than 90 local governments have proposed, passed or rejected laws prohibiting landlords from leasing to illegal immigrants, penalizing businesses that employ them or training police to enforce immigration laws.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/swept_away	Child, teen swept away by Colo. flooding - Yahoo! News Child, teen swept away by Colo. flooding Tue May 15, 3:31 PM ET DENVER - Severe thunderstorms sent normally placid streams over their banks across the Denver area, sweeping away a 2-year-old boy in a stroller and a teenager who was trying to help with a rescue. Both were still missing Tuesday, police said. The toddler's mother had been out for a stroll Monday along a bike path that follows a creek near downtown. It had been a sunny morning, and the thunderstorm developed quickly. In less than an hour, it dumped more than an inch of rain, flooding streets and sending a torrent of water down the tiny creek. The woman sought refuge under a bridge as hail started to fall but realized she needed to leave the path, Denver Fire Department spokesman Phil Champagne said. "Once you enter (the bike path), you're in a chute," Champagne said. "She knew she was in trouble and was trying to get out. She was on the phone with her grandfather, trying to figure out a way out. "The water knocked her down, she was dragged for a little bit and was unable to hold onto the stroller," Champagne said. "What a tragic event. That poor mother to see her child swept away like that." Firefighters struggled against the current to rescue the woman, but her son and stroller were swept downstream. The stroller was later found empty more than a mile away in the South Platte River, Champagne said. Firefighters sent two divers to reach the mother as she clung to a concrete embankment. When she realized firefighters did not her son, she apparently released her grip and drifted downstream, where other firefighters pulled her from the water, Champagne said. In south Denver, a police officer and firefighters were able to save one teenager from a swollen creek in a park, but another teen who apparently was trying to help was swept away and remained missing, Champagne said. Rescuers searched Tuesday for the 2-year-old, believing he could have become stuck in the eddies of the South Platte River. A search for the teen was expected later. The officer was hospitalized with what appeared to be hypothermia, police spokesman John White said. The missing baby's mother was also hospitalized. Their names were not released.

Hundreds of workers were laid off and viewers of his television show dwindled. Liberty University was $73 million in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy, and his "Old Time Gospel Hour" was $16 million in debt. By the mid-1990s, two local businessmen with long ties to Falwell began overseeing the finances and helped get companies to forgive debts or write them off. Falwell dreamed that Liberty would grow to 50,000 students and be to fundamentalist Christians what Notre Dame is to Roman Catholics and Brigham Young University is to Mormons. Falwell's father and his grandfather were militant atheists, he wrote in his autobiography. He said his father made a fortune off his businesses &#151; including bootlegging during Prohibition. As a student, Falwell was a star athlete and a prankster who was barred from giving his high school valedictorian's speech after he was caught using counterfeit lunch tickets. He ran with a gang of juvenile delinquents before becoming a born-again Christian at 19. He turned down an offer to play professional baseball and transferred from Lynchburg College to Baptist Bible College in Springfield, Mo. "My heart was burning to serve Christ," he once said in an interview. "I knew nothing would ever be the same again." Falwell had made careful preparations for a transition of his leadership to his two sons, Jerry Falwell, Jr., now vice chancellor of Liberty University, and Jonathan Falwell, executive the pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church. Falwell is survived by his wife, Macel, his two sons and a daughter, Jeannie Falwell Savas. Funeral arrangements were not immediately known. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a Mormon whose own faith has become an issue during his run for the presidency, said Falwell "built and led a movement based on strong principles and strong faith," and "the legacy of his important work will continue through his many ministries where he put his faith into action."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/gay_marriage	Conn. high court mulls gay marriage case - Yahoo! News Conn. high court mulls gay marriage case By STEPHANIE REITZ, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 5:27 AM ET HARTFORD, Conn. - The long-simmering question of whether same-sex couples in Connecticut should be allowed to marry is now in the hands of seven state Supreme Court justices. Arguments in the potentially groundbreaking case wrapped up in about three hours Monday, but it likely will be months before justices rule on the lawsuit that eight same-sex couples originally filed in August 2004. The couples, who have been together between 13 and 31 years, allege their equal protection and due process were violated when they were denied marriage licenses in Madison Town Hall. Their case also raises questions about whether the state's 2005 civil unions law &#151; the first adopted nationwide without court pressure &#151; helped or hurt same-sex couples in their quest for equality. The plaintiffs want the court to rule that the state's marriage law discriminates against them because it applies only to heterosexual couples, therefore denying gay couples the financial, social and emotional benefits of marriage. "What is denied to these families is something that goes to the heart of equal protection, which is the right to be part of the fabric of society when they are just the same as other couples and other families," said their attorney, Bennett Klein. The state argued Monday that Connecticut's civil unions law gives the couples the equality they seek, and that the issue is a policy question best left to lawmakers rather than judges. "All of those rights and benefits, at least under state law, have been granted," Assistant Attorney General Jane Rosenberg said. "From a legal perspective, there are no rights that have been taken away from that group and, in fact, equal rights have now been given to that group." As several states consider civil union laws, the Connecticut case could have nationwide ramifications. People on both sides said Monday they are well aware of its significance. "Our 9-year-old said it best: 'How is the world supposed to get better if nothing changes?'" said Geraldine Artis of Clinton, who is a plaintiff along with her partner of 13 years, Suzanne Artis. One recurring theme at Monday's hearing was whether gays and lesbians should be considered a protected group, a legal term for a segment of the population that, among other things, is particularly vulnerable to discrimination and lacks political power. Peter Wolfgang, public policy director for the Family Institute of Connecticut, which opposes same-sex marriage, said that claim is weak. He cited the existence of Connecticut's civil unions law, the growing number of openly gay lawmakers in powerful positions, and a recent legislative committee vote in favor of same-sex marriages. "I think it would be very hard to argue that gays and lesbians are powerless in Connecticut in 2007," Wolfgang said after the hearing. If justices agree with the same-sex couples, they could order the case back to the trial court, with instructions to rule in favor of the couples. They could also order the General Assembly to consider overhauling the current marriage laws. Currently, only Massachusetts allows same-sex couples to marry. Connecticut, Vermont, California, New Jersey, Maine and Washington have laws allowing either civil unions or domestic partnerships, and a civil unions law is expected to take effect in New Hampshire in January. Hawaii extends certain spousal rights to same-sex couples and cohabiting heterosexual pairs. Full Coverage: Gay & Lesbian Issues Anglican church turmoil over gay issues deepens Reuters via Yahoo!

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/arson_pleas	Arsonists, yes. But are they terrorists? - Yahoo! News Arsonists, yes. But are they terrorists? By JEFF BARNARD, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 10:48 AM ET EUGENE, Ore. - Their guilt isn't in question. The six men and four women already admitted being involved in a series of arson fires that did $40 million in damage to research facilities, a ski resort and other businesses in the West. But are they terrorists as the government says? A federal judge was set to hear arguments Tuesday on a motion by the government to add a so-called terrorism enhancement to their sentences. Prosecutors want Judge Ann Aiken to declare the group terrorists &#151; something defense attorneys argue has never happened in 1,200 arsons nationwide claimed by Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front. The defense argues that branding their clients terrorists is more about politics than sentencing. "The Government has Attorney General Alberto Gonzales' political agenda to advance with this case, and nothing else to lose if the Court declines to impose the enhancement," wrote attorney Terri Wood, who represents Stanislas G. Meyerhoff. Meyerhoff faces the stiffest sentence recommendation for his involvement in seven fires and the toppling of a high-tension power line. The terrorism enhancement question will be settled in his case and, under an agreement with all parties, applied to the remaining defendants. Each has pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and arson. A ruling that the 10 are terrorists is not likely to boost the time they spend behind bars &#151; the prosecution recommends three to 16 years &#151; but it could land them in tougher prisons. The fires targeted forest ranger stations, meat packing plants, wild horse corrals, lumber mill offices, research facilities, an SUV dealer and, in 1998, Vail Ski Resort. No one was injured, the defense notes in legal motions. The case, known as Operation Backfire, is the biggest prosecution ever of environmental extremists, and has turned on its head the prevailing idea that arsonists have generally acted alone, said Brent Smith, director of the Terrorism Research Center at the University of Arkansas. "We thought these people operated for the last 15 years under this kind of uncoordinated violence approach, just like the extreme right was doing &#151; leaderless resistance," Smith said. "That's why this case is so very different." Prosecution filings argue that though the defendants were never convicted of terrorism, they qualify for the label because at least one of the fires each of them set was intended to change or retaliate against government policy.

Wallace shooting fades By BEN EVANS, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 9:30 AM ET LAUREL, Md. - Many of Laurel's older residents can point to the precise spot in the shopping center where Arthur Bremer's gunshots paralyzed Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace and cut short his campaign for the White House in 1972. They recall just what they were doing that May 15 afternoon when they heard that the loner from Milwaukee had shot Wallace five times as he shook hands in the parking lot of what was then the city's main retail plaza. But 35 years later, as Laurel struggles to retain its small-town identity, the collective memory of its most famous event is fading. "People say it happened over near the bank, but other people say it was over there" by the drug store, said Scott Branch, standing behind the counter of the Hobby Works store he manages in the Laurel Shopping Center. Branch said he frequently uses the shooting as a landmark in giving directions to the store. But with the younger set, "I tell them it's where the Books-A-Million is and they say, 'Oh, I know where that is.'" Wallace, who had carried five Southern states as a fist-shaking third party candidate in 1968, was mounting a surprisingly successful run in the Democratic primaries in 1972 before Laurel. Billing himself as the candidate of "the average American," he was viewed as a serious wild card in the party and in Republican President 's bid for re-election. A former segregationist, Wallace was best known for standing defiantly at the all-white University of Alabama in a symbolic face-off with the Justice Department as the National Guard stood by and two black students enrolled in 1963. By 1972, he had tempered his racist rhetoric and adopted a more subtle approach, denouncing federal courts over the "involuntary busing" of schoolchildren to meet desegregation orders and pledging a return to a "law and order" society. Wallace had consistently fared well in polls and a few weeks before Laurel had led the crowded Democratic field in the presidential primary in Florida, where he carried every county. Even as he lay in the hospital after the assassination attempt, he led in Maryland and Michigan. But the shooting effectively ended his national career, diminishing the fiery charisma that had made him a dominant political force in Alabama and leaving him in a wheelchair until his death in 1998. There has never been much discussion of erecting a public marker on the site, city spokesman Jim Collins said. Even though Wallace ultimately apologized and asked forgiveness for his segregationist stands, a memorial would probably meet opposition because of his past, Collins said. Views might be different had Wallace died at the site, he said. Memorials are more common at sites where historical figures died, such as John F. Kennedy in Dallas or the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis. There is no marker, for example, at the Washington hotel where President Reagan was wounded in a 1981 shooting. Michael Brey, who owns the Hobby Works store, said a simple marker might be appropriate. But he said it could be tricky. "How do you do it without making it seem like it's a monument to a man who stood out in front of a school blocking black children from attending?" he said. Today, Laurel hardly resembles the small mill town it once was. Growth from the nation's capital about 20 miles to the south has surrounded the city with suburbs, and a busy commercial district with fast-food restaurants and car dealerships now dwarfs the strip center where Wallace was shot. No one seems to know what happened to the wooden stage that the shopping center would roll out for community events and that Wallace stood upon to deliver his stump speech before wading into the crowd. The bank that sits alone in the middle of the parking lot &#151; and is closest to the shooting site &#151; once displayed a large photograph of the scene in the lobby. But the national chain that bought the bank took it down years ago. "I heard about it when I first opened my account," said 20-year Laurel resident Dianne W. Shields as she left the bank recently. "They had (the photo) posted right there in front. You couldn't miss it ... everybody would talk about it." Wallace's family has never considered requesting a marker at the site, said Wallace's son, George Wallace Jr., a former Alabama Public Service commissioner who lost a bid to become lieutenant governor last year. If the local community wanted one, the family wouldn't object, he said. But it isn't planning to get involved. "Time passes, memories fade. It's part of life," he said. "It is a very historic site though. It sure is." (This version CORRECTS spelling of Brey.)

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/fort_drum_missing_soldiers	Missing soldiers from Fort Drum - Yahoo! News Missing soldiers from Fort Drum 1 hour, 58 minutes ago FORT DRUM, N.Y. - The seven American victims of a weekend ambush in were members of the storied 10th Mountain Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Army officials in Iraq said Tuesday. The attack near Mahmoudiya, in a Sunni stronghold 20 miles south of Baghdad, left four U.S. soldiers and an Iraqi translator dead, and three other soldiers missing. acknowledged for the first time that it believes the missing soldiers are in terrorist hands. The Islamic State of Iraq &#151; an al-Qaida front group that has claimed to have captured the soldiers &#151; has warned the U.S. to stop its massive search for the missing. Military officials would not release the names of the soldiers until their families were notified but confirmed they were assigned to Company D, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, nicknamed the "Polar Bears," said Lt. Col. Paul Fitzpatrick, a Fort Drum spokesman. All the missing soldiers are men, Fitzpatrick said. "It's been the unfortunate experience that soldiers who have been captured have not all turned out well. We are hoping this turns out to be an exception," he said. The 10th Mountain Division has a reputation for success that dates to World War II. Ready to go anywhere in the world within 48 hours, the 10th Mountain is trained to fight in steamy jungles, sandy deserts, cities and, of course, mountains. Families of the soldiers released the names of two of the dead on Monday &#151; Sgt. 1st Class James David Connell Jr., 40, of Lake City, Tenn., and Pfc. Daniel Courneya, 19, of Vermontville, Mich. Connell's family learned of his death Saturday afternoon, they said. The soldier had just recovered from a shrapnel wound to the leg and had visited his family on leave this month. The family is now planning a memorial service in Lake City and a burial at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his brother, Jeff Connell. "I'm proud of my dad, because he didn't really fight for himself, he fought for the country," Connell's teenage daughter, Courtney, told Knoxville's WATE-TV. In Michigan, students at Maple Valley High School created a memorial for Courneya, who graduated in 2005 and was well-known in the small community southwest of Lansing. He was a member of the school's track and soccer teams and played clarinet in the band. "It's a tribute of photos, posters, plaques and a picture of him in his uniform," school official Kelly Zank told The Associated Press on Tuesday. His death was announced Monday over the school's public address system, and a moment of silence was observed, she said. Courneya's mother, Wendy Thompson, said his wife, Jennifer, called family members Saturday night to tell them he had been killed. Thompson said her husband, Army Spc. David Thompson, was in Iraq and returning home after learning of his stepson's death. If all three soldiers now missing were taken alive, it would be the biggest single abduction of U.S. soldiers in Iraq since March 23, 2003, when Pvt. Jessica Lynch and six others were captured in an ambush near Nasiriyah that also left 11 Americans dead. The 2nd Brigade Combat Team is in the 10th month of a 15-month tour in Iraq. The brigade was also deployed to Iraq in 2005. The 10th Mountain Division made its reputation in World War II, when soldiers scaled a sheer, 1,500-foot cliff under cover of darkness and fought their way through the snowy mountains of northern Italy in 1945. That spearheaded the drive that would liberate the country from the Nazis. The 10th Mountain was the Army's most frequently deployed division during the 1990s, serving in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere. The division's members became the first regular U.S. ground troops to be sent to Central Asia as part of American's response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Its soldiers provided security for U.S. Air Force fighter and combat search-and-rescue teams in Uzbekistan.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/missing_officer	Search on in S.C. for missing officer - Yahoo! News Search on in S.C. for missing officer By BRUCE SMITH, Associated Press Writer LADSON, S.C. - Dozens of police officers and bloodhounds searched for a missing constable Tuesday after his empty cruiser was found in flames several miles from where he was last seen at a traffic stop, authorities said. Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said authorities had identified a "person of interest" who was being sought on an unrelated weapons charge. But he said officials don't know what happened to Robert Lee Bailey, a 67-year-old constable who works for the Lincolnville Police Department. "It certainly does not look good. But we are hopeful. We have no explanation for what occurred," Cannon said. Bailey was last seen when he pulled a vehicle over about 10:30 p.m. Monday in Lincolnville. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots a few minutes later, and Bailey's cap, two guns, bullet casings and blood were found in a yard. About an hour later, a Highway Patrol officer spotted Bailey's burning car in the parking lot of a church off Interstate 26. The shooting was not believed to be related to the traffic stop, Cannon said. Cannon said officials wanted to speak to a 24-year-old man wanted on a federal weapons charge. Walter Fayall, of St. Stephens, was being sought by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. No charges had been filed against him in the missing officer case. The sheriff said authorities are investigating whether Fayall lived in a house near the shooting site. Cannon also said two people may have been involved, since the police cruiser was burned several miles from the shooting scene. Authorities also issued an alert for a black Chevrolet Caprice. Along highways near Lincolnville, a small town about 20 miles west of Charleston, electronic signs listed a fugitive alert. Gary Tucker, data analyst for Faith Assembly of God Church, saw the charred remains of the cruiser early Tuesday. "I just noticed it was a police car and it was torched. And the back window was smashed out," he said. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division sent agents to help in the investigation, spokeswoman Kathryn Richardson said. Constables assist law enforcement agencies and may carry firearms. They must complete a basic training course at a state technical college before they can be appointed by the governor. During his career, Bailey worked as a law officer for both Dorchester County and the city of Charleston. He worked as a constable with the Charleston County Sheriff's Department and with Lincolnville, Cannon said. One of Bailey's neighbors, Gloria Dearborn, said she hadn't given up hope he would be found alive. "He was wonderful. He's been our neighbor for 25 years," Dearborn said. Associated Press writer Katrina A. Goggins in Columbia contributed to this report. (This version CORRECTS Bailey's age to 67, not 66.)

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/padilla_terror_charges	CIA agent testifies at Padilla trial - Yahoo! News CIA agent testifies at Padilla trial By CURT ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 47 minutes ago MIAMI - A covert officer who was permitted to testify wearing a disguise and using an alias described in court Tuesday how U.S. officials in obtained a truckload of al-Qaida documents, including a form later linked to suspected operative Jose Padilla. The officer, whose true identity is classified, gave his name as Tom Langston. He appeared in court with a beard and glasses, although the nature of the disguise was not obvious or made public. Prosecutors declined to say whether any concealment was even used. The arrangement was approved by U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke at the request of the CIA, which sought to protect the officer's ability to continue doing clandestine work overseas. It was not disclosed to the jury. Langston testified that he was working in December 2001 at a classified CIA site in Kandahar, Afghanistan, when an Afghan man driving a pickup truck showed up with thousands of pages of documents. Among them was a bright blue binder containing what appeared to be dozens of forms in Arabic, one of which reportedly turned out to be Padilla's. Prosecutors say his fingerprints are on the "mujahedeen data form," which had questions on language skills, military experience, religious education and other areas. The form is crucial to the government's case because it could link Padilla and his two suspected co-conspirators &#151; Adham Amin Hassoun and Kifah Wael Jayyousi &#151; to al-Qaida. The three are charged with being part of a U.S.-based support cell for Islamic extremists around the world, including al-Qaida. The unidentified Afghan man, Langston said, was affiliated with an Afghan tribal leader opposed to the country's Islamic fundamentalist Taliban rulers, who were then battling U.S. forces. Under the Taliban, al-Qaida had established terrorist training camps in Afghanistan in the years leading to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. "He was loyal to some individuals who were cooperating with us against the Taliban and the terrorist element," the CIA officer said. The Afghan man told the CIA he collected the documents from a house occupied by Arabs who had fled shortly before the 2001 U.S. invasion and were known locally to be affiliated with al-Qaida. Langston said the man was not paid or given any other benefit by U.S. officials for the documents, although he was prohibited after prosecutors objected from answering questions about whether the man's tribal leader was compensated. "I think he took this initiative on his own," the CIA officer said of the man who brought the documents. At one point, Langston grew reluctant to answer a question from Padilla attorney Orlando do Campo about how CIA officers and analysts handle documents such as those in the binder. "I'm a little uncomfortable answering the question because it gets into methods. I'm sworn to protect sources and methods," he said. The binder and other documents were kept in a locked room at the CIA installation in Kandahar, then placed in boxes and taken on U.S. vehicles and aircraft to the in Islamabad, Pakistan. The binder was in a box labeled "vegetable oil," the CIA officer said. The FBI legal attache there in late 2001, Jennifer Keenan, testified Tuesday that she remembered the binder among 22 boxes, trunks and other containers because it appeared to hold information important for U.S. counterterrorism investigators. "We were very grateful to find this," Keenan said. "I called it a pledge form. It says pledge on it." It wasn't until later that the FBI in Washington was able to link one of the forms to Padilla, who allegedly filled it out under the name Abu Abdullah al-Mujahir in July 2000. A key to making that link was information gathered during U.S. interrogations of other suspected al-Qaida figures, according to documents filed in the Padilla case. Testimony will resume Thursday. Prosecutors say their witnesses will include Yahya Goba, a member of the "Lackawanna Six" group of men who pleaded guilty in 2003 in New York to attending al-Qaida camps. Goba, who received a 10-year prison sentence, will testify that he attended the same camp as Padilla and filled out an identical form, prosecutor Brian Frazier said. Padilla, a 36-year-old former Chicago gang member and U.S. citizen, was arrested by the FBI in May 2002 when he arrived at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The Bush administration initially accused him of plotting to detonate a radioactive "dirty bomb" in a U.S. city, but those allegations are not part of the criminal indictment. Padilla was added to the Miami case after 3 1/2 years in military custody as an enemy combatant. His case was the subject of a lengthy legal battle over the president's wartime detention powers over U.S. citizens. Padilla and his two co-defendants face up to life in prison if convicted of all charges.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/katrina_opportunity	New Orleans neighborhood rescues itself - Yahoo! News New Orleans neighborhood rescues itself By JOHN MORENO GONZALES, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 2:09 PM ET NEW ORLEANS - Paul Pablovich was the very picture of a good neighbor as he shoveled debris off the curb and mowed other people's lawns in Lakeview, a middle-class section of town that was swamped with 15 feet of water during Hurricane Katrina and is now a patchwork of gutted and newly built homes. But he wasn't doing it entirely out of the goodness of his heart. He was protecting his investment. Pablovich, an entrepreneur who lived in a different part of New Orleans before Katrina, bought a bungalow on the street from an elderly resident after the storm, renovated it and plans to live there with his fiancee. He purchased a second abandoned house for $107,000, fixed it up and hopes to resell it for $214,000. He would like to "flip" several other properties on the block, too. The way he sees it, capitalism is the road to recovery for Lakeview. "It's how the country was built," Pablovich, 38, said of the $600,000 he has pumped into the real estate market. "Free-market economics will kick in." Lakeview, a 7,000-home mostly white enclave in a city that is predominantly black, has emerged as a success story in the reconstruction of New Orleans through entrepreneurs like Pablovich and strong civic organization that existed long before the storm. In contrast, hard-hit black middle-class neighborhoods in eastern New Orleans do not have the same financial means and civic organization, and are not drawing nearly as much private investment. As a result, their recovery is crawling. "If you're going to speculate, you're much more likely to speculate in Lakeview than you would in the east," said Louisiana State University sociology professor Jeanne Hulbert. "But you could end up, potentially, with a social and economic structure in the city that really carves out the black middle class." Nearly 21 months after Katrina, Lakeview has lights and other utilities, but still has no firehouse and no public school. But it is a community so fiercely independent it tried in the 1990s to secede from the city. And its residents &#151; who include business executives and other professionals &#151; have considerable organizational skills. Lakeview's churches arranged for volunteers around the country to plant trees along Canal Boulevard, the main drag. And recently, nearly 1,000 original and potential new residents came to a civic association tutorial on how to navigate the city's bureaucracy and find a reputable contractor. In fact, the civic association drew up a list of recommended contractors by running credit checks on them and consulting the Better Business Bureau. The group is so organized it has compiled its own data on rebuilding, finding in a February survey that 67 percent of Lakeview's lots were in some stage of transformation. Seventeen percent were newly inhabited, just over 26 percent were under repair, and 23 percent had been demolished to pave the way for rebuilding. In contrast, neighborhood leaders in eastern New Orleans, which encompasses four ZIP codes to Lakeview's one, are just now undertaking a house-to-house count. Independent research, at first glance, suggests Lakeview and eastern New Orleans have rebuilt at similar rates. GCR and Associates Inc. found last week that based on utility hookups, close to 36 percent of residents in the Lakeview ZIP code were back, versus 33 percent in the eastern New Orleans ZIP codes. However, Richard Campanella, associate director of Tulane and Xavier universities' Center for Biomedical Research, found that the flooding in Lakeview was, by some measures, far more severe. For example, nearly 22 percent of homes in Lakeview got more than 8 feet of water, compared with 3.5 percent in eastern New Orleans. Lakeview has eclipsed eastern New Orleans in real estate sales since Katrina. Sixty-nine houses were sold there nine months before the disaster, compared with 147 during the past nine months of recovery, a 113 percent jump. In eastern New Orleans, 215 single-family homes were sold in the nine months before Katrina, and 287 during the past nine months, a 33 percent increase. As he painted over the rust on an iron fence that ringed his family's home in eastern New Orleans, Hank Long said it was obvious to him that his part of town was rebuilding with sweat equity more often than financial equity. "In Lakeview, many of those houses were already paid for. A lot of people are still paying their mortgages here," said Long, a 60-year-old black man. "Nobody has big money here. They gutted out their house, and that's as far as they got. Whatever they could do, they did on their own." Hulbert of LSU said: "You have to remember the black middle class only took hold in the 1960s. That is different from several generations of middle-class life. Many middle-class blacks in New Orleans were the first in their families to go to college, and it appears many had their entire savings tied up in their homes." David Bell, president of the East New Orleans Neighborhood Advisory Commission, which formed in March to bind together 15 area groups, said a lack of private investment means eastern New Orleans is much more dependent on government recovery aid, with all the bureaucracy and politics that entails. For example, a centerpiece of the eastern New Orleans redevelopment plan is a proposed $100 million shopping strip. But federal grants for the project will not be fully released until the city comes up with 10 percent. Back in Lakeview, residents like to say that they ask mostly one thing of the city: for it to get out of the way. TKTMJ Inc., a builder that is selling modular homes in the neighborhood, found the area so profitable that it established an office in Lakeview and has dubbed one of its designs "The Lakeview." Tommy Callia, a sales representative with the company, noted that most of those able to rebuild are middle class and white. "I think we're not going to be as diverse as we once were, and that's going to be sad," he said. "You can say it's a little like a gumbo: If you don't have all the ingredients, something is missing in the taste."

Firefighters pushed the flames back to the containment line, but dry weather and 15 mph wind in north Florida was expected to further hinder their work. "If we can just get through today," said Russell Hubright, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman. Between 250 and 500 homes west of U.S. 441 had to be evacuated for a second time when the fire line was breached, Florida Highway Patrol Lt. Michael Burroughs said. An additional 570 people who were ordered out of homes east of the roadway were still waiting to return. The wildfire had raced through the Okefenokee Swamp in southeast Georgia and into northern Florida after being started by lightning more than a week ago. By Tuesday, it had burned 109,000 acres in Florida and 139,813 acres of swampland in Georgia &#151; nearly 390 square miles in all. Flames jumped a containment line at the fire's western edge, but firefighters used bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters to extinguish them, said John Speaks, deputy incident commander with the forest service. The fire was about 1 1/2 miles from U.S. 441. On the western edge of the Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia, Fargo residents were told to stay alert as wind forecast at up to 20 mph pushed the blaze against fire breaks plowed between the swamp and the city of 380 people. "Everybody's being told not to let their guard down, don't unpack," said Laura Polant, a fire information officer in Fargo. "Residents are still being told to be prepared to leave, because the call can come at any time." In Florida, the blaze was 50 percent contained Tuesday. The smoke had lifted enough to open Interstates 10 and 75 to traffic, but drivers were warned that periodic closures were still possible. Another large wildfire, in northeastern Minnesota and Ontario, could be brought under control by the end of the week, officials said. No one has been seriously hurt in the fire, which has burned 117 square miles of Minnesota and Canada, but many cabins and smaller structures &#151; more than 100 in all &#151; have been destroyed. Associated Press writers Russ Bynum in Savannah, Ga., and Jennifer Kay in Miami contributed to this report.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/pesticides_schools	AP: Children face exposure to pesticides - Yahoo! News AP: Children face exposure to pesticides By GARANCE BURKE, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 35 minutes ago STRATHMORE, Calif. - On Grandparents Day, Domitila Lemus accompanied her 8-year-old granddaughter to school. As the girls lined up behind Sunnyside Union Elementary, a foul mist drifted onto the playground from the adjacent orange groves, witnesses say. Lemus started coughing, and two children collapsed in spasms, vomiting on the blacktop. She and the little girls have since recovered without apparent lasting effects. But an Associated Press investigation has found that over the past decade, hundreds, possibly thousands, of schoolchildren in California and other agricultural states have been exposed to farm chemicals linked to sickness, brain damage and birth defects. The family of at least one California teenager suspects pesticides caused her death. There are no federal laws specifically against spraying near schools, and advocates say California and the seven other states that have laws or policies creating buffer zones around schools to protect them from pesticides don't do enough to enforce them. "The regulations are inadequate. In the vast majority of cases, people who didn't follow the laws received at best a $400 fine," said Margaret Reeves, a scientist with the Pesticide Action Network, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco. The pesticide industry says it is committed to safety, and regulators say they are doing their best to enforce the laws. "Everyone wants to protect children," said California Department of Pesticide Regulation spokesman Glenn Brank. He said his agency is doing what it can to enforce the law with a shortage of agricultural inspectors. In the Strathmore incident last November, grandparents said the spraying was being done less than 150 feet from the children. Tulare County authorities fined an unlicensed pest removal company $1,100 for spraying a restricted weed killer that morning. But no action was taken over what witnesses said happened to the children. Because no one reported the incident as a case of pesticide drift, county agricultural inspectors never swabbed the jungle gym or took grass samples, making it impossible to establish whether pesticide had, in fact, drifted onto the playground. does not keep comprehensive national figures on students and teachers sickened by drifting pesticide. In California, the No. 1 farm state and the one with the best records, there were 590 pesticide-related illnesses at schools from 1996 to 2005, according to figures given to the AP by the state. More than a third of those were due to pesticide drift, the figures show. Activists say that those numbers are low and that many cases are never even reported. In California's long, flat interior, spraying season lasts seven months, from March through September. When citrus trees blossom and grapevines climb trellises, Lemus prays to the Virgin Mary that her granddaughter won't come home with her eyes watering and head pounding, unable to breathe. Tulare County, where she lives, is one of the nation's most fertile farm regions, with more than half the schools within a quarter-mile of agricultural fields, according to the nonprofit Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment. As suburbs push close to farmland, the rate of pesticide poisoning among children nationwide has risen in recent years, according to a 2005 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association Journal of the American Medical Association . The study found that 40 percent of all children sickened by pesticides at school were victims of drift &#151; pesticide carried on the breeze. Research on pregnant women exposed to common pesticides has suggested higher rates of premature birth, and poor neurological development and smaller head circumferences among their babies. The effects on children of small, repeated exposures over a long period of time are unclear, said University of California, Berkeley epidemiologist Brenda Eskenazi. But acute pesticide poisoning can cause nausea, blurred vision, an abnormally fast heart rate, paralysis and death. Chrissy Garavito, a 15-year-old high school sophomore, died in Fontana in 1997 of a heart rhythm disturbance her mother believes was triggered by exposure to chemicals sprayed at the school. Authorities never confirmed that pesticides contributed to her death. In 2001, pesticide poisoning nearly killed Elena Dominguez, then a sixth-grader in Wenatchee, Wash. One day, after playing Frisbee during gym class across the street from an apple orchard, she passed out at her desk. "She was in a stupor," said her mother, Cindy Dominguez. "She couldn't talk, her eyes were rolling back in her head." Emergency room doctors dismissed Elena's abnormally fast heart rate as a symptom of dehydration, gave her intravenous fluids and sent her home. Three weeks later, it happened again. "I was at a track meet and all of a sudden I felt really, really tired," said Elena, now 18. "I made it to the finish line and just fell over." Investigators found her clothes were soaked in the pesticide Endosulfan I; it had been picked up from residue on the grass and absorbed into her bloodstream through her skin. Officials later found five other pesticides on school grounds and fined the apple grower for forging his applicator's license. The Dominguez family sued the orchard owner and the Wenatchee school district, which established rules requiring students to stay inside after a spraying, among other things. State officials believe it is the only district in Washington with such limitations. But keeping students inside may not be enough. Two years ago, 600 students and staff members were evacuated from an Edinburg, Texas, elementary school after pesticides drifted from a cotton field into the school's air conditioning system. Thirty-nine people developed nausea and headaches. EPA officials say they have no real idea how often pesticides waft onto school grounds. The EPA must register pesticides before they are sold, but federal law does not restrict where they can be sprayed. "We implement the laws that Congress gives us," said Ruth Allen, an EPA epidemiologist. Once the EPA approves a product, federal law requires manufacturers to report any "unreasonable adverse effects on the environment of the pesticide" that their products cause. Activists say industry is essentially allowed to police itself. CropLife America, a national organization representing suppliers of farm pesticides, said their use near schools is well-regulated. "We're really committed to public safety," said spokeswoman Donna Uchida. "Any kind of use of a pesticide has a labeling requirement that is imposed to protect human health and the environment." California has some of the strictest pesticide laws in the nation. Under state law, growers and pest control companies can be fined if pesticide drifts from a field and sickens people. A 2002 state law allows county authorities to establish a no-spray buffer zone of a quarter-mile around schools. But Tulare County has not done so. State officials said they did not know how many counties have set up such buffer zones. Lemus and environmentalists are pushing for pesticide-free zones throughout California. "Why don't they tell us they'll spray beforehand so we can bring our children inside?" Lemus said. Students sickened when pesticides drift AP via Yahoo!

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/climate_summit	World mayors hold climate summit in NYC - Yahoo! News World mayors hold climate summit in NYC By SARA KUGLER, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 25 minutes ago NEW YORK - City leaders from around the world declared at an environmental summit Tuesday that they can no longer wait for national governments to reverse global warming and instead must find solutions on their own. Mayors from Seoul to Sao Paulo and Albuquerque to Addis Ababa gathered at the summit, hosted by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former President , to exchange ideas on how their cities have gone green. "We cannot sit around and watch our environment deteriorate and put this world in jeopardy," Bloomberg said. "The public wants action, and if you have a void, the mayors are going to fill that void." Mayors and local leaders from more than 30 cities kicked off the conference, known as the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit, which first met in 2005 in London. Clinton did not attend Tuesday but was expected to be there Wednesday. Organizers say cities bear a significant responsibility to address climate change because they generate 80 percent of heat-trapping greenhouse gases but cover less than 1 percent of the Earth's surface. "It is in cities that the battle to tackle climate change will be won or lost," London Mayor Ken Livingstone said. The meeting comes at a time when many countries are struggling to address global and national standards for carbon reduction. This week, U.N. delegates are meeting in Germany to gear up for December negotiations on a new set of international rules for controlling greenhouse gas emissions. The new accord would succeed the Kyoto Protocol, which ends in 2012. When the Group of Eight major industrialized countries &#151; the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and Russia &#151; meet in Germany in June, climate change will also be on the agenda. Meanwhile, the mayors said Tuesday, local governments can't wait around. "Where national governments can't or won't lead, cities will," Toronto Mayor David Miller said. Douglas Palmer, mayor of Trenton, N.J., and president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said 500 of the nation's mayors have now signed the group's climate agreement, a pledge that is in line with the Kyoto Protocol. That 1997 international treaty requires the industrialized countries that signed it to cut emissions by 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012; the U.S. did not join the pact. Throughout the first day of the conference, which ends Thursday, participants attended panels on various topics, from water use to transportation. In a discussion on transportation, the mayor of the Brazilian city of Curitiba described his city's solutions, which include a bus rapid transit system, while Livingstone described London's program to reduce traffic by charging motorists extra money in the city center. Bloomberg recently announced his intention to begin a similar traffic charging program in Manhattan. London traffic congestion dropped by 20 percent, and carbon emissions in the central zone similarly decreased, Livingstone said. The fee &#151; equal to about $16 &#151; has gone up since it started in 2003. "People may not like paying the 5 pounds a day, but they certainly didn't want to live with that style of congestion," Livingstone said. He said his city's next goal is to charge more for higher-polluting cars, a pricing scale that could mean a $50 equivalent charge for the worst offenders. Summit organizers invited business leaders to the gathering in an effort to involve the private sector. They hope to convince them that going green &#151; through innovative construction, transportation alternatives and other environmental changes &#151; is profitable.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/cruise_ship_aground	Cruise ship runs aground off Alaska - Yahoo! News Cruise ship runs aground off Alaska By ANNE SUTTON, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 5:11 AM ET JUNEAU, Alaska - When the Empress of the North ran aground, the band played on &#151; as everyone disembarked in a safe and orderly fashion. Passengers jolted awake by the ship hitting a charted reef 50 miles southwest of Juneau early Monday were ordered to don lifejackets and gather in the ballroom, where a singer and piano player entertained them with songs including "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" as they waited for rescue. Passengers praised the ship's crew for taking charge. "They just seemed to know what they were doing. They were caring, courteous, the whole thing, and I think that's what kept everybody calm," said Mary Crosby, 83, of Seattle. National Transportation Safety Board National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the grounding of the riverboat-style cruise ship, which had 206 passengers and 75 crew members on board. One person was taken to a hospital for observation, a Juneau city official said. When Coast Guard helicopters reached the area, the vessel was listing at the southern end of Icy Strait and had begun taking on water, the Coast Guard said. As the ship's pumps worked to remove the water, the passengers were transferred safely to other boats in the area and then to an Alaska state ferry to be taken to Juneau. The Empress of the North floated free of the rock during the evacuation, and the crew was able to stabilize the ship, said the Coast Guard. The ship arrived in Juneau with a Coast Guard escort about nine hours after the grounding. The ferry Columbia arrived shortly after. State officials said the hull sustained significant damage and an empty fuel tank was breached during the grounding. A light oil sheen was seen in the area but officials were uncertain if the ship was the source. Coast Guard Petty Officer Barry Lane said Coast Guard inspectors did an initial survey of the ship as it was moored in Juneau's Auke Bay and will pass the information on to the NTSB. It wasn't immediately clear why the cruise ship ran aground, said Coast Guard officials. It was drizzling in Juneau but the seas were calm. Good Samaritans were first on the scene of the grounding and passengers were initially evacuated onto lifeboats, a charter fishing boat, a tugboat, another small cruise ship and a coast guard cutter before the Columbia arrived. "The morning was incredible. You had anybody and everybody that could get there and they all got there as quick as they could and all were willing to help out," said Coast Guard Capt. Mark Guillory, federal on-scene coordinator. Passengers left the ship with only their personal identification and medications. They were to be reunited with their belongings later in Juneau. All had been flown to Seattle by evening, said company officials. "It couldn't have been better orchestrated the way things fell into place," said Chief Petty Officer Barry Lane. The Empress of the North is operated by Majestic America Line of Seattle. The ship has 112 staterooms, a three-story paddlewheel and galleries featuring Native American masks and Russian artwork, including Faberge eggs, according to its Web site. The 360-foot ship is less than half the size of the average cruise ship in the Caribbean, and is also dwarfed by most cruise other ships off the Alaska coast. The grounding occurred on the second day of a seven-day cruise, said Dan Miller, a spokesman for Majestic America. The American-built ship is billed by the company as the only overnight paddlewheel vessel in use on Alaska cruises. It also is used on cruises on the Columbia River between Washington state and Oregon. The Empress of the North has had other problems since it began operating in mid-2003. In October of that year, it hit a navigation lock on the Snake River in Washington. It has also run aground at least twice before &#151; once after developing steering problems on the Columbia River, and once on a sandbar near Washougal, Wash., as it tried to avoid a barge.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/gay_marriage	Conn. high court mulls gay marriage case - Yahoo! News Conn. high court mulls gay marriage case By STEPHANIE REITZ, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 5:27 AM ET HARTFORD, Conn. - The long-simmering question of whether same-sex couples in Connecticut should be allowed to marry is now in the hands of seven state Supreme Court justices. Arguments in the potentially groundbreaking case wrapped up in about three hours Monday, but it likely will be months before justices rule on the lawsuit that eight same-sex couples originally filed in August 2004. The couples, who have been together between 13 and 31 years, allege their equal protection and due process were violated when they were denied marriage licenses in Madison Town Hall. Their case also raises questions about whether the state's 2005 civil unions law &#151; the first adopted nationwide without court pressure &#151; helped or hurt same-sex couples in their quest for equality. The plaintiffs want the court to rule that the state's marriage law discriminates against them because it applies only to heterosexual couples, therefore denying gay couples the financial, social and emotional benefits of marriage. "What is denied to these families is something that goes to the heart of equal protection, which is the right to be part of the fabric of society when they are just the same as other couples and other families," said their attorney, Bennett Klein. The state argued Monday that Connecticut's civil unions law gives the couples the equality they seek, and that the issue is a policy question best left to lawmakers rather than judges. "All of those rights and benefits, at least under state law, have been granted," Assistant Attorney General Jane Rosenberg said. "From a legal perspective, there are no rights that have been taken away from that group and, in fact, equal rights have now been given to that group." As several states consider civil union laws, the Connecticut case could have nationwide ramifications. People on both sides said Monday they are well aware of its significance. "Our 9-year-old said it best: 'How is the world supposed to get better if nothing changes?'" said Geraldine Artis of Clinton, who is a plaintiff along with her partner of 13 years, Suzanne Artis. One recurring theme at Monday's hearing was whether gays and lesbians should be considered a protected group, a legal term for a segment of the population that, among other things, is particularly vulnerable to discrimination and lacks political power. Peter Wolfgang, public policy director for the Family Institute of Connecticut, which opposes same-sex marriage, said that claim is weak. He cited the existence of Connecticut's civil unions law, the growing number of openly gay lawmakers in powerful positions, and a recent legislative committee vote in favor of same-sex marriages. "I think it would be very hard to argue that gays and lesbians are powerless in Connecticut in 2007," Wolfgang said after the hearing. If justices agree with the same-sex couples, they could order the case back to the trial court, with instructions to rule in favor of the couples. They could also order the General Assembly to consider overhauling the current marriage laws. Currently, only Massachusetts allows same-sex couples to marry. Connecticut, Vermont, California, New Jersey, Maine and Washington have laws allowing either civil unions or domestic partnerships, and a civil unions law is expected to take effect in New Hampshire in January. Hawaii extends certain spousal rights to same-sex couples and cohabiting heterosexual pairs. Full Coverage: Gay & Lesbian Issues Anglican church turmoil over gay issues deepens Reuters via Yahoo!

Because no one reported the incident as a case of pesticide drift, county agricultural inspectors never swabbed the jungle gym or took grass samples, making it impossible to establish whether pesticide had, in fact, drifted onto the playground. does not keep comprehensive national figures on students and teachers sickened by drifting pesticide. In California, the No. 1 farm state and the one with the best records, there were 590 pesticide-related illnesses at schools from 1996 to 2005, according to figures given to the AP by the state. More than a third of those were due to pesticide drift, the figures show. Activists say that those numbers are low and that many cases are never even reported. In California's long, flat interior, spraying season lasts seven months, from March through September. When citrus trees blossom and grapevines climb trellises, Lemus prays to the Virgin Mary that her granddaughter won't come home with her eyes watering and head pounding, unable to breathe. Tulare County, where she lives, is one of the nation's most fertile farm regions, with more than half the schools within a quarter-mile of agricultural fields, according to the nonprofit Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment. As suburbs push close to farmland, the rate of pesticide poisoning among children nationwide has risen in recent years, according to a 2005 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association Journal of the American Medical Association . The study found that 40 percent of all children sickened by pesticides at school were victims of drift &#151; pesticide carried on the breeze. Research on pregnant women exposed to common pesticides has suggested higher rates of premature birth, and poor neurological development and smaller head circumferences among their babies. The effects on children of small, repeated exposures over a long period of time are unclear, said University of California, Berkeley epidemiologist Brenda Eskenazi. But acute pesticide poisoning can cause nausea, blurred vision, an abnormally fast heart rate, paralysis and death. Chrissy Garavito, a 15-year-old high school sophomore, died in Fontana in 1997 of a heart rhythm disturbance her mother believes was triggered by exposure to chemicals sprayed at the school. Authorities never confirmed that pesticides contributed to her death. In 2001, pesticide poisoning nearly killed Elena Dominguez, then a sixth-grader in Wenatchee, Wash. One day, after playing Frisbee during gym class across the street from an apple orchard, she passed out at her desk. "She was in a stupor," said her mother, Cindy Dominguez. "She couldn't talk, her eyes were rolling back in her head." Emergency room doctors dismissed Elena's abnormally fast heart rate as a symptom of dehydration, gave her intravenous fluids and sent her home. Three weeks later, it happened again. "I was at a track meet and all of a sudden I felt really, really tired," said Elena, now 18. "I made it to the finish line and just fell over." Investigators found her clothes were soaked in the pesticide Endosulfan I; it had been picked up from residue on the grass and absorbed into her bloodstream through her skin. Officials later found five other pesticides on school grounds and fined the apple grower for forging his applicator's license. The Dominguez family sued the orchard owner and the Wenatchee school district, which established rules requiring students to stay inside after a spraying, among other things. State officials believe it is the only district in Washington with such limitations. But keeping students inside may not be enough. Two years ago, 600 students and staff members were evacuated from an Edinburg, Texas, elementary school after pesticides drifted from a cotton field into the school's air conditioning system. Thirty-nine people developed nausea and headaches. EPA officials say they have no real idea how often pesticides waft onto school grounds. The EPA must register pesticides before they are sold, but federal law does not restrict where they can be sprayed. "We implement the laws that Congress gives us," said Ruth Allen, an EPA epidemiologist. Once the EPA approves a product, federal law requires manufacturers to report any "unreasonable adverse effects on the environment of the pesticide" that their products cause. Activists say industry is essentially allowed to police itself. CropLife America, a national organization representing suppliers of farm pesticides, said their use near schools is well-regulated. "We're really committed to public safety," said spokeswoman Donna Uchida. "Any kind of use of a pesticide has a labeling requirement that is imposed to protect human health and the environment." California has some of the strictest pesticide laws in the nation. Under state law, growers and pest control companies can be fined if pesticide drifts from a field and sickens people. A 2002 state law allows county authorities to establish a no-spray buffer zone of a quarter-mile around schools. But Tulare County has not done so. State officials said they did not know how many counties have set up such buffer zones. Lemus and environmentalists are pushing for pesticide-free zones throughout California. "Why don't they tell us they'll spray beforehand so we can bring our children inside?" Lemus said. Students sickened when pesticides drift AP via Yahoo!

News Arson squad probes 6 Newport, RI, fires Tue May 15, 8:50 AM ET NEWPORT, R.I. - An arson task force is investigating a string of six fires that have broken out in the city since May, three of them in just the past week. On Sunday, fires that started within a few hours of each other damaged two century-old homes, one of them a Victorian house that had been converted into apartments. A few days earlier, a fire destroyed a downtown souvenir shop. "We're asking the public to be very vigilant," police Captain Wayne Morrison said. "Any and all information could be useful, even if people think it's trivial." The task force, which includes members of the city's police and fire departments, the state Fire Marshal's Office and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, is looking into six fires dating to a March 5 blaze in a mixed-use building. "We're all apprehensive," said Federico Santi, who owns an antiques business, The Drawing Room of Newport. "We're wondering, 'Am I going to go to bed and wake up with a fireman breaking down the door?'" Newport, a city of about 25,000 residents, is known for its colonial heritage and Gilded Age mansions. It is bordered by Rhode Island Sound and Narragansett Bay.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/space_shuttle	Shuttle rolls back out to launch pad - Yahoo! News Shuttle rolls back out to launch pad By MIKE SCHNEIDER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 12:05 PM ET CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - After 2 1/2 months of repairs to its external fuel tank, space shuttle Atlantis returned to the launch pad Tuesday in anticipation of an early June liftoff to the international space station. The 3.4-mile, early-morning trip aboard the massive crawler-transporter took under seven hours from when the shuttle left the Vehicle Assembly Building to when it was secured at the launch pad. The last time Atlantis made that trip was in February. The shuttle was on its launch pad when a freak hail storm swept through and pounded fuel tank with golf ball-sized hail that left thousands of dings in the tank's insulating foam. managers postponed a planned mid-March launch and ordered the shuttle returned to the Vehicle Assembly Building for repairs. Technicians sprayed on new insulation foam in some areas, hand-poured foam on other areas and sanded down spots. When the shuttle rolled out Tuesday, the orange tank had hundreds of white speckles at the top showing their work. The launch is now planned for no earlier than June 8. A final decision will be made at the end of the month. "It's a real success story &#151; almost bordering on an Apollo 13 type story to develop that in such a short time," John Chapman, NASA's manager of the external tank project, said last week, referring to the engineering ingenuity that delivered the moon-bound crew safely back to Earth in 1970 after an oxygen tank ruptured on the spacecraft. Foam debris coming off the external fuel tank has been of special concern to NASA since the seven astronauts aboard Columbia perished when a piece of foam from the tank struck a wing during launch, allowing fiery gases to penetrate the space shuttle while returning to Earth. Astronaut Clayton Anderson has been added to the previously six-man Atlantis crew so he can replace U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams on the international space station. Until the shuttle arrives, Williams and her colleagues at the space station will make do with 2 1/2 tons of fuel, air, water and other supplies that were delivered Tuesday by a Russian cargo vehicle. NASA managers hope Atlantis' launch puts the space agency back on a regular schedule of shuttle missions after a five-month hiatus. The last space shuttle flight was in December, and three more missions are scheduled for this year after Atlantis. The space agency has at least 14 more missions to finish building the space station and repair the before the shuttle fleet is grounded in 2010. The next-generation spacecraft, Orion, isn't scheduled to fly astronauts until 2015. Last week, leaders of almost two dozen aerospace companies sent a letter to members of Congress urging them to support funding NASA an additional $1.4 billion above the administration's 2008 budget request of $17.3 billion to narrow the gap when the United States won't have manned spaceflights. "Future U.S. leadership in space is at stake," the letter said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/road_rage	Miami holds top spot on rude driver list - Yahoo! News Miami holds top spot on rude driver list By SARAH LARIMER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 9:07 AM ET MIAMI - For the second straight year, rude Miami drivers have earned the city the title of worst road rage in a survey released Tuesday. Miami motorists said they saw other drivers slam on their brakes, run red lights and talk on cell phones, according to AutoVantage, a Connecticut-based automobile membership club offering travel services and roadside assistance. Other cities near the top of the rude drivers list were New York, Boston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. South Miami resident Erik Pinto told The Associated Press he's probably seen every bad driving habit on Miami's roads. "You don't want to know what I've seen," Pinto said. "I've seen everything. I'm from L.A., and we don't see the crazy drivers that you see here." Portland, Ore., drivers were the least likely of the cities to see other motorists tailgating on the roadways, and St. Louis motorists were the least likely to swear at another driver, the survey found. Minneapolis-St. Paul was rated the most courteous city in 2006 but slipped to the middle of the list this year. The most frequent cause of road rage cited in the survey was impatient motorists. Drivers also cited poor driving in fast lanes and driving while stressed, frustrated or angry. "The best piece of advice is to take a deep breath. Slow down, be aware and be careful," AutoVantage spokesman Todd Smith said, adding the aim of the survey is to increase driver safety across the nation. More than 2,500 drivers who regularly commute in 25 major metropolitan areas were asked to rate road rage and rude driving in telephone surveys between January and March. The survey was conducted by Prince Market Research has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/immigration_texas	Groups: Block Texas town's immigrant ban - Yahoo! News Groups: Block Texas town's immigrant ban By ANABELLE GARAY, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 2:45 PM ET DALLAS - Latino activists and civil liberties advocates asked a federal judge Tuesday to block a voter-approved ordinance that prohibits landlords from renting apartments to most illegal immigrants in the Dallas suburb of Farmers Branch. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union American Civil Liberties Union , which have already sued the city, requested the temporary restraining order in U.S. District Court. The ordinance, scheduled to take effect next Tuesday, requires apartment managers to verify that renters are U.S. citizens or legal immigrants before leasing to them, with some exceptions. Violators face fines of up to $500. "It is unfortunate that the residents of Farmers Branch have chosen to implement a law which is not only bad policy, but is likely also unconstitutional," said Lisa Graybill, legal director for the ACLU of Texas. "Now the issue will have to be resolved in federal court." The city is preparing a response to the request, said Matthew Boyle, an attorney representing Farmers Branch. City council members first approved the ban in November without discussion, then revised it in January to include exemptions for minors, seniors and some mixed-status families. On Saturday, residents voted to approve the ban with 68 percent of voters in favor, according to unofficial results. Councilman Tim O'Hare, the ordinance's lead proponent, contends the city's economy and quality of life will improve if illegal immigrants are kept out. O'Hare declined to comment Tuesday. Since 1970, Farmers Branch has changed from a small, predominantly white bedroom community with a declining population to a city of almost 28,000 people, about 37 percent of them Hispanic, according to the U.S. Farmers Branch already faces four lawsuits brought by civil rights groups, residents, property owners and businesses, who say the ordinance discriminates and puts landlords in the precarious position of acting as federal immigration officers. Their attorneys argue the ordinance attempts to regulate immigration, a duty that is exclusively the federal government's. Nationwide, more than 90 local governments have proposed, passed or rejected laws prohibiting landlords from leasing to illegal immigrants, penalizing businesses that employ them or training police to enforce immigration laws.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/border_biometrics	AP IMPACT: Laser visas are rarely used - Yahoo! News AP IMPACT: Laser visas are rarely used By ELLIOT SPAGAT, Associated Press Writer SAN DIEGO - The face- and fingerprint-matching technology that has been touted over the past decade as a sophisticated new way to stop terrorists and illegal immigrants from entering the country through Mexico has one major drawback: U.S. border inspectors almost never use it. In fact, the necessary equipment is not even installed in vehicle lanes along the border. Government officials told The Associated Press that checking more people would create too big a backup at the border, where hours-long traffic jams are already common. Some members of Congress who voted for the system in 1996 are complaining they were misled. They said the intent was to use biometrics &#151; or a person's unique physical traits &#151; to screen everyone. "Congress would not have gone to the trouble of requiring biometric features on the border crossing card if it knew the administration would not require that those features be read by scanners," said Rep. Lamar Smith ( ), R-Texas, who wrote the legislation. The U.S. government has spent tens of millions of dollars issuing visa cards digitally embedded with the holder's photo and fingerprints. Holders of the cards come across the border tens of millions of times each year. But on average, in only about 2 percent of those cases are the cardholders screened with the biometric technology to verify their identities and check law-enforcement records, said Paul Morris, Customs and Border Protection's executive director of admissibility requirements and migration control. The checks are done consistently only on the small portion of cardholders who seek permission to travel beyond the border region. "As the technology becomes available, we can expand the current level of biometric matching," Morris said. "There is not a technology solution currently available that will not cause delays that are well beyond the acceptable levels." Beginning in 1998, the high-tech "laser visas" have been issued to 9.1 million Mexicans for short visits to the United States. The laser visas, which look like driver's licenses, have a 1.4-inch optical memory stripe holding personal information such as name, gender and birth date. The stripe also stores the owner's digitized facial photo and two fingerprints. Cardholders coming across the border may be asked to press their fingers against a glass and pose for a photo, while their card pulls up their biometric file &#151; a process that takes an extra 30 seconds or so per person. The photo and fingerprints can also be instantly checked against criminal and terrorist watch lists. The laser visas entitle Mexicans to travel 25 miles from the border &#151; slightly farther in Arizona &#151; for 30 days. Cardholders can also apply for a permit to travel anywhere in the U.S. for up to six months. Border inspectors routinely swipe the laser visas through a machine to retrieve the basic personal information and to call up a photo. But, with some exceptions, the inspectors use the facial- and fingerprint-matching technology only for those applying at the border for one of the six-month permits, Morris said. That practice means that most of those who are checked are not selected at random; they know they are going to be scanned when they come across. The government contract for laser visas was worth $28.6 million from 2000 to 2006, and awarded a five-year renewal in March to General Dynamics Corp. worth $28.5 million, according to Homeland Security. That price tag excludes the cost of opening new consulates to handle the rush of applicants. The State Department established consulates across the border from Laredo, Texas, and Nogales, Ariz. In Tijuana, Mexico, the consulate took over an old gymnasium across town. The 1996 law said anyone presenting a border crossing card "is not permitted to cross over the border into the U.S. unless the biometric identifier contained on the card matches the appropriate biometric characteristics of the alien." But Sandra Raynes, consular officer at the U.S. consulate in Tijuana, said: "If they were to check everyone, you'd have lines all the way down to Cabo San Lucas," about 1,100 miles south of San Diego. U.S. officials said biometrics are only part of its effort to stem illegal crossings. An inspector's wits and agency intelligence are also key, they said. Biometrics "is one tool in our toolbox," said Kelly Klundt, a Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman. Also, the laminated cards have reduced fraud because they are difficult to counterfeit, officials said. Older visas looked like crumpled library cards, some dating to the 1950s. Authorities said women in their 60s used cards with photographs of teenage girls because the cards had no expiration dates. Former Rep. Jim Kolbe, a Republican who left Congress in January after 22 years representing a district on the Arizona border, said lawmakers expected checks on all cardholders, though there was no timetable. "We definitely intended to go further with it than we have," he said. "Ten years later, it seems incredible that we've only gotten this far with it." The 14 pedestrian booths at San Ysidro, the nation's busiest border crossing by far, are equipped with fingerprint glass but no cameras. But that glass is not used on the 30,000 people who walk though daily. There is neither type of equipment in the 24 vehicle lanes, which handle about 35,000 cars and 250 buses a day. Applicants for the six-month permits are asked to pull aside into a small parking lot, get out and walk up to a booth, where they are fingerprinted and photographed for verification. Initially, border crossings did not even have equipment to lift personal information off the cards, let alone the biometric data. Jeffrey Davidow, U.S. ambassador to Mexico from 1998 to 2001, recalls members of Congress visiting the border to see the machines, which were never used when the lawmakers were gone. "I'd tell them that it was all show, that it doesn't work, that the card is not doing what it's supposed to do," Davidow said. He said his warnings elicited shrugs. There were also technological setbacks. Equipment to verify photos and fingerprints often failed to read through sweat, scratches and other wallet "crud," according to an internal Homeland Security report. A test at five Texas crossings in the spring of 2004 showed that 731 out of 1,740 cards, or 42 percent, were unreadable, according to the report, which was provided to The Associated Press by someone who insisted on anonymity because the government did not authorize its release. Homeland Security officials did not have more recent figures on how many cards are correctly read. But they said technical problems have been resolved.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/fort_drum_missing_soldiers	Missing soldiers from Fort Drum - Yahoo! News Missing soldiers from Fort Drum 1 hour, 58 minutes ago FORT DRUM, N.Y. - The seven American victims of a weekend ambush in were members of the storied 10th Mountain Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Army officials in Iraq said Tuesday. The attack near Mahmoudiya, in a Sunni stronghold 20 miles south of Baghdad, left four U.S. soldiers and an Iraqi translator dead, and three other soldiers missing. acknowledged for the first time that it believes the missing soldiers are in terrorist hands. The Islamic State of Iraq &#151; an al-Qaida front group that has claimed to have captured the soldiers &#151; has warned the U.S. to stop its massive search for the missing. Military officials would not release the names of the soldiers until their families were notified but confirmed they were assigned to Company D, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, nicknamed the "Polar Bears," said Lt. Col. Paul Fitzpatrick, a Fort Drum spokesman. All the missing soldiers are men, Fitzpatrick said. "It's been the unfortunate experience that soldiers who have been captured have not all turned out well. We are hoping this turns out to be an exception," he said. The 10th Mountain Division has a reputation for success that dates to World War II. Ready to go anywhere in the world within 48 hours, the 10th Mountain is trained to fight in steamy jungles, sandy deserts, cities and, of course, mountains. Families of the soldiers released the names of two of the dead on Monday &#151; Sgt. 1st Class James David Connell Jr., 40, of Lake City, Tenn., and Pfc. Daniel Courneya, 19, of Vermontville, Mich. Connell's family learned of his death Saturday afternoon, they said. The soldier had just recovered from a shrapnel wound to the leg and had visited his family on leave this month. The family is now planning a memorial service in Lake City and a burial at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his brother, Jeff Connell. "I'm proud of my dad, because he didn't really fight for himself, he fought for the country," Connell's teenage daughter, Courtney, told Knoxville's WATE-TV. In Michigan, students at Maple Valley High School created a memorial for Courneya, who graduated in 2005 and was well-known in the small community southwest of Lansing. He was a member of the school's track and soccer teams and played clarinet in the band. "It's a tribute of photos, posters, plaques and a picture of him in his uniform," school official Kelly Zank told The Associated Press on Tuesday. His death was announced Monday over the school's public address system, and a moment of silence was observed, she said. Courneya's mother, Wendy Thompson, said his wife, Jennifer, called family members Saturday night to tell them he had been killed. Thompson said her husband, Army Spc. David Thompson, was in Iraq and returning home after learning of his stepson's death. If all three soldiers now missing were taken alive, it would be the biggest single abduction of U.S. soldiers in Iraq since March 23, 2003, when Pvt. Jessica Lynch and six others were captured in an ambush near Nasiriyah that also left 11 Americans dead. The 2nd Brigade Combat Team is in the 10th month of a 15-month tour in Iraq. The brigade was also deployed to Iraq in 2005. The 10th Mountain Division made its reputation in World War II, when soldiers scaled a sheer, 1,500-foot cliff under cover of darkness and fought their way through the snowy mountains of northern Italy in 1945. That spearheaded the drive that would liberate the country from the Nazis. The 10th Mountain was the Army's most frequently deployed division during the 1990s, serving in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere. The division's members became the first regular U.S. ground troops to be sent to Central Asia as part of American's response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Its soldiers provided security for U.S. Air Force fighter and combat search-and-rescue teams in Uzbekistan.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/missing_officer	Search on in S.C. for missing officer - Yahoo! News Search on in S.C. for missing officer By BRUCE SMITH, Associated Press Writer LADSON, S.C. - Dozens of police officers and bloodhounds searched for a missing constable Tuesday after his empty cruiser was found in flames several miles from where he was last seen at a traffic stop, authorities said. Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said authorities had identified a "person of interest" who was being sought on an unrelated weapons charge. But he said officials don't know what happened to Robert Lee Bailey, a 67-year-old constable who works for the Lincolnville Police Department. "It certainly does not look good. But we are hopeful. We have no explanation for what occurred," Cannon said. Bailey was last seen when he pulled a vehicle over about 10:30 p.m. Monday in Lincolnville. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots a few minutes later, and Bailey's cap, two guns, bullet casings and blood were found in a yard. About an hour later, a Highway Patrol officer spotted Bailey's burning car in the parking lot of a church off Interstate 26. The shooting was not believed to be related to the traffic stop, Cannon said. Cannon said officials wanted to speak to a 24-year-old man wanted on a federal weapons charge. Walter Fayall, of St. Stephens, was being sought by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. No charges had been filed against him in the missing officer case. The sheriff said authorities are investigating whether Fayall lived in a house near the shooting site. Cannon also said two people may have been involved, since the police cruiser was burned several miles from the shooting scene. Authorities also issued an alert for a black Chevrolet Caprice. Along highways near Lincolnville, a small town about 20 miles west of Charleston, electronic signs listed a fugitive alert. Gary Tucker, data analyst for Faith Assembly of God Church, saw the charred remains of the cruiser early Tuesday. "I just noticed it was a police car and it was torched. And the back window was smashed out," he said. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division sent agents to help in the investigation, spokeswoman Kathryn Richardson said. Constables assist law enforcement agencies and may carry firearms. They must complete a basic training course at a state technical college before they can be appointed by the governor. During his career, Bailey worked as a law officer for both Dorchester County and the city of Charleston. He worked as a constable with the Charleston County Sheriff's Department and with Lincolnville, Cannon said. One of Bailey's neighbors, Gloria Dearborn, said she hadn't given up hope he would be found alive. "He was wonderful. He's been our neighbor for 25 years," Dearborn said. Associated Press writer Katrina A. Goggins in Columbia contributed to this report. (This version CORRECTS Bailey's age to 67, not 66.)

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/space_shuttle	Shuttle rolls back out to launch pad - Yahoo! News Shuttle rolls back out to launch pad By MIKE SCHNEIDER, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 12:05 PM ET CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - After 2 1/2 months of repairs to its external fuel tank, space shuttle Atlantis returned to the launch pad Tuesday in anticipation of an early June liftoff to the international space station. The 3.4-mile, early-morning trip aboard the massive crawler-transporter took under seven hours from when the shuttle left the Vehicle Assembly Building to when it was secured at the launch pad. The last time Atlantis made that trip was in February. The shuttle was on its launch pad when a freak hail storm swept through and pounded fuel tank with golf ball-sized hail that left thousands of dings in the tank's insulating foam. managers postponed a planned mid-March launch and ordered the shuttle returned to the Vehicle Assembly Building for repairs. Technicians sprayed on new insulation foam in some areas, hand-poured foam on other areas and sanded down spots. When the shuttle rolled out Tuesday, the orange tank had hundreds of white speckles at the top showing their work. The launch is now planned for no earlier than June 8. A final decision will be made at the end of the month. "It's a real success story &#151; almost bordering on an Apollo 13 type story to develop that in such a short time," John Chapman, NASA's manager of the external tank project, said last week, referring to the engineering ingenuity that delivered the moon-bound crew safely back to Earth in 1970 after an oxygen tank ruptured on the spacecraft. Foam debris coming off the external fuel tank has been of special concern to NASA since the seven astronauts aboard Columbia perished when a piece of foam from the tank struck a wing during launch, allowing fiery gases to penetrate the space shuttle while returning to Earth. Astronaut Clayton Anderson has been added to the previously six-man Atlantis crew so he can replace U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams on the international space station. Until the shuttle arrives, Williams and her colleagues at the space station will make do with 2 1/2 tons of fuel, air, water and other supplies that were delivered Tuesday by a Russian cargo vehicle. NASA managers hope Atlantis' launch puts the space agency back on a regular schedule of shuttle missions after a five-month hiatus. The last space shuttle flight was in December, and three more missions are scheduled for this year after Atlantis. The space agency has at least 14 more missions to finish building the space station and repair the before the shuttle fleet is grounded in 2010. The next-generation spacecraft, Orion, isn't scheduled to fly astronauts until 2015. Last week, leaders of almost two dozen aerospace companies sent a letter to members of Congress urging them to support funding NASA an additional $1.4 billion above the administration's 2008 budget request of $17.3 billion to narrow the gap when the United States won't have manned spaceflights. "Future U.S. leadership in space is at stake," the letter said.

News Arson squad probes 6 Newport, RI, fires Tue May 15, 8:50 AM ET NEWPORT, R.I. - An arson task force is investigating a string of six fires that have broken out in the city since May, three of them in just the past week. On Sunday, fires that started within a few hours of each other damaged two century-old homes, one of them a Victorian house that had been converted into apartments. A few days earlier, a fire destroyed a downtown souvenir shop. "We're asking the public to be very vigilant," police Captain Wayne Morrison said. "Any and all information could be useful, even if people think it's trivial." The task force, which includes members of the city's police and fire departments, the state Fire Marshal's Office and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, is looking into six fires dating to a March 5 blaze in a mixed-use building. "We're all apprehensive," said Federico Santi, who owns an antiques business, The Drawing Room of Newport. "We're wondering, 'Am I going to go to bed and wake up with a fireman breaking down the door?'" Newport, a city of about 25,000 residents, is known for its colonial heritage and Gilded Age mansions. It is bordered by Rhode Island Sound and Narragansett Bay.

News Extremist taunts his victims from prison By JAY REEVES, Associated Press Writer Mon May 14, 11:28 PM ET BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - Victims of Eric Rudolph, the anti-abortion extremist who pulled off a series of bombings across the South, say he is taunting them from deep within the nation's most secure federal prison, and authorities say there is little they can do to stop him. Rudolph, who was captured after a five-year manhunt and pleaded guilty in deadly bombings at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and a Birmingham abortion clinic, is serving life in prison at the "Supermax" penitentiary in Florence, Colo. Housed in the most secure part of the prison, he has no computer and little contact with the outside world aside from writing letters. But Rudolph's long essays have been posted on the Internet by a supporter who maintains an Army of God Web site. The Army of God is the same loose-knit group that Rudolph claimed to represent in letters sent after the blasts. In one piece, Rudolph seeks to justify violence against abortion clinics by arguing that Jesus would condone "militant action in defense of the innocent." In another essay about his sentencing, Rudolph mocks former abortion clinic nurse Emily Lyons, who was nearly killed in the 1998 bombing in Birmingham, and her husband, Jeff. He uses pseudonyms rather than naming the couple, but there is no doubt he is describing them. Rudolph recalls how Emily Lyons, in court, described the pain of her injuries and made an obscene gesture at Rudolph as she showed off a finger mangled by the blast. Rudolph writes: "It was a great speech and one that the denizens of freedom should be proud to enshrine in a museum somewhere. Perhaps they could put it next to MLKs `I Have a Dream.' They could call it `I Have a Middle Finger.'" Jeff Lyons said he doesn't often look at the Web site, which has had some items posted for nearly two years. But he said he is worried that Rudolph's messages could incite someone to violence against abortion providers. "He's still sending out harassing communication. He's still hurting us," Lyons said. Diane Derzis, who owns the Birmingham clinic that was bombed, killing a police officer, said someone should stop Rudolph. Bureau of Prisons regulations give wardens the right to reject correspondence by an inmate for "the protection of the public, or if it might facilitate criminal activity." That includes material "which may lead to the use of physical violence." The Bureau of Prisons failed to respond to repeated inquiries from The Associated Press about whether Rudolph's writings violate prison rules. But U.S. Attorney Alice Martin, who helped prosecute Rudolph for the Alabama bombing, said there is nothing the prison can do to restrict Rudolph or the supporter who keeps posting his writings, anti-abortion activist Donald Spitz of Chesapeake, Va. "An inmate does not lose his freedom of speech," she said. Spitz said he corresponds regularly with Rudolph and posts some of his essays because of their shared desire to end abortion. As for those who might be offended, he said, "They don't have to look at it on the Web site." John Hawthorne, whose wife, Alice, was killed in the Olympic bombing, said he isn't bothered by Rudolph's essays. "As far as I'm concerned he's out of sight, out of mind," Hawthorne said. "I don't mind him saying whatever he's going to say as long as they keep him locked up." Supermax has a capacity of 490 and holds some of the nation's most infamous inmates, including Unabomber Theodore Kaczyinski and Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui. A Justice Department report last fall criticized the prison for not properly screening inmate mail. It determined that three men convicted in the World Trade Center bombing were able to send dozens of letters overseas to suspected terrorists. Texas youth prisons suspends 4 more AP via Yahoo!

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/us/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/wildfires	Hundreds more flee massive Fla. wildfire - Yahoo! News Hundreds more flee massive Fla. wildfire By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 1:05 PM ET LAKE CITY, Fla. - Authorities evacuated hundreds of homes after a massive wildfire along the Georgia-Florida border jumped a containment line overnight, authorities said Tuesday. Firefighters pushed the flames back to the containment line, but dry weather and 15 mph wind in north Florida was expected to further hinder their work. "If we can just get through today," said Russell Hubright, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman. Between 250 and 500 homes west of U.S. 441 had to be evacuated for a second time when the fire line was breached, Florida Highway Patrol Lt. Michael Burroughs said. An additional 570 people who were ordered out of homes east of the roadway were still waiting to return. The wildfire had raced through the Okefenokee Swamp in southeast Georgia and into northern Florida after being started by lightning more than a week ago. By Tuesday, it had burned 109,000 acres in Florida and 139,813 acres of swampland in Georgia &#151; nearly 390 square miles in all. Flames jumped a containment line at the fire's western edge, but firefighters used bulldozers and water-dropping helicopters to extinguish them, said John Speaks, deputy incident commander with the forest service. The fire was about 1 1/2 miles from U.S. 441. On the western edge of the Okefenokee Swamp in Georgia, Fargo residents were told to stay alert as wind forecast at up to 20 mph pushed the blaze against fire breaks plowed between the swamp and the city of 380 people. "Everybody's being told not to let their guard down, don't unpack," said Laura Polant, a fire information officer in Fargo. "Residents are still being told to be prepared to leave, because the call can come at any time." In Florida, the blaze was 50 percent contained Tuesday. The smoke had lifted enough to open Interstates 10 and 75 to traffic, but drivers were warned that periodic closures were still possible. Another large wildfire, in northeastern Minnesota and Ontario, could be brought under control by the end of the week, officials said. No one has been seriously hurt in the fire, which has burned 117 square miles of Minnesota and Canada, but many cabins and smaller structures &#151; more than 100 in all &#151; have been destroyed. Associated Press writers Russ Bynum in Savannah, Ga., and Jennifer Kay in Miami contributed to this report.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/border_biometrics	AP IMPACT: Laser visas are rarely used - Yahoo! News AP IMPACT: Laser visas are rarely used By ELLIOT SPAGAT, Associated Press Writer SAN DIEGO - The face- and fingerprint-matching technology that has been touted over the past decade as a sophisticated new way to stop terrorists and illegal immigrants from entering the country through Mexico has one major drawback: U.S. border inspectors almost never use it. In fact, the necessary equipment is not even installed in vehicle lanes along the border. Government officials told The Associated Press that checking more people would create too big a backup at the border, where hours-long traffic jams are already common. Some members of Congress who voted for the system in 1996 are complaining they were misled. They said the intent was to use biometrics &#151; or a person's unique physical traits &#151; to screen everyone. "Congress would not have gone to the trouble of requiring biometric features on the border crossing card if it knew the administration would not require that those features be read by scanners," said Rep. Lamar Smith ( ), R-Texas, who wrote the legislation. The U.S. government has spent tens of millions of dollars issuing visa cards digitally embedded with the holder's photo and fingerprints. Holders of the cards come across the border tens of millions of times each year. But on average, in only about 2 percent of those cases are the cardholders screened with the biometric technology to verify their identities and check law-enforcement records, said Paul Morris, Customs and Border Protection's executive director of admissibility requirements and migration control. The checks are done consistently only on the small portion of cardholders who seek permission to travel beyond the border region. "As the technology becomes available, we can expand the current level of biometric matching," Morris said. "There is not a technology solution currently available that will not cause delays that are well beyond the acceptable levels." Beginning in 1998, the high-tech "laser visas" have been issued to 9.1 million Mexicans for short visits to the United States. The laser visas, which look like driver's licenses, have a 1.4-inch optical memory stripe holding personal information such as name, gender and birth date. The stripe also stores the owner's digitized facial photo and two fingerprints. Cardholders coming across the border may be asked to press their fingers against a glass and pose for a photo, while their card pulls up their biometric file &#151; a process that takes an extra 30 seconds or so per person. The photo and fingerprints can also be instantly checked against criminal and terrorist watch lists. The laser visas entitle Mexicans to travel 25 miles from the border &#151; slightly farther in Arizona &#151; for 30 days. Cardholders can also apply for a permit to travel anywhere in the U.S. for up to six months. Border inspectors routinely swipe the laser visas through a machine to retrieve the basic personal information and to call up a photo. But, with some exceptions, the inspectors use the facial- and fingerprint-matching technology only for those applying at the border for one of the six-month permits, Morris said. That practice means that most of those who are checked are not selected at random; they know they are going to be scanned when they come across. The government contract for laser visas was worth $28.6 million from 2000 to 2006, and awarded a five-year renewal in March to General Dynamics Corp. worth $28.5 million, according to Homeland Security. That price tag excludes the cost of opening new consulates to handle the rush of applicants. The State Department established consulates across the border from Laredo, Texas, and Nogales, Ariz. In Tijuana, Mexico, the consulate took over an old gymnasium across town. The 1996 law said anyone presenting a border crossing card "is not permitted to cross over the border into the U.S. unless the biometric identifier contained on the card matches the appropriate biometric characteristics of the alien." But Sandra Raynes, consular officer at the U.S. consulate in Tijuana, said: "If they were to check everyone, you'd have lines all the way down to Cabo San Lucas," about 1,100 miles south of San Diego. U.S. officials said biometrics are only part of its effort to stem illegal crossings. An inspector's wits and agency intelligence are also key, they said. Biometrics "is one tool in our toolbox," said Kelly Klundt, a Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman. Also, the laminated cards have reduced fraud because they are difficult to counterfeit, officials said. Older visas looked like crumpled library cards, some dating to the 1950s. Authorities said women in their 60s used cards with photographs of teenage girls because the cards had no expiration dates. Former Rep. Jim Kolbe, a Republican who left Congress in January after 22 years representing a district on the Arizona border, said lawmakers expected checks on all cardholders, though there was no timetable. "We definitely intended to go further with it than we have," he said. "Ten years later, it seems incredible that we've only gotten this far with it." The 14 pedestrian booths at San Ysidro, the nation's busiest border crossing by far, are equipped with fingerprint glass but no cameras. But that glass is not used on the 30,000 people who walk though daily. There is neither type of equipment in the 24 vehicle lanes, which handle about 35,000 cars and 250 buses a day. Applicants for the six-month permits are asked to pull aside into a small parking lot, get out and walk up to a booth, where they are fingerprinted and photographed for verification. Initially, border crossings did not even have equipment to lift personal information off the cards, let alone the biometric data. Jeffrey Davidow, U.S. ambassador to Mexico from 1998 to 2001, recalls members of Congress visiting the border to see the machines, which were never used when the lawmakers were gone. "I'd tell them that it was all show, that it doesn't work, that the card is not doing what it's supposed to do," Davidow said. He said his warnings elicited shrugs. There were also technological setbacks. Equipment to verify photos and fingerprints often failed to read through sweat, scratches and other wallet "crud," according to an internal Homeland Security report. A test at five Texas crossings in the spring of 2004 showed that 731 out of 1,740 cards, or 42 percent, were unreadable, according to the report, which was provided to The Associated Press by someone who insisted on anonymity because the government did not authorize its release. Homeland Security officials did not have more recent figures on how many cards are correctly read. But they said technical problems have been resolved.

News UT-Austin fires financial aid chief By LIZ AUSTIN PETERSON, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 10:44 AM ET AUSTIN, Texas - The University of Texas at Austin fired its financial aid director after determining he had owned stock in a loan company in violation of university rules. Associate Vice President Lawrence Burt has been on paid leave since early last month, when he was named in a New York attorney general's investigation into the $85 billion student loan industry. Burt has denied wrongdoing. He did not return a telephone call seeking comment after his firing Monday. A University of Texas System investigation found that Burt placed a subsidiary of the loan company at the top of several preferred lender lists without any apparent justification. The subsidiary, Student Loan Xpress, trailed many other companies in volume, customer service and default rates, the investigation found. But it was among the lenders that offered the most benefits to financial aid staff, including happy hours. Burt owned 2,300 shares in Education Lending Group Inc., the former parent company of Student Loan Xpress, the investigation by UT System General Counsel Barry Burgdorf found. That includes 1,500 shares he bought from a friend shortly before adding the lender to the preferred list. Burgdorf found no direct evidence that Burt accepted the stock in exchange for adding Student Loan Xpress to the list. "Nevertheless, the timing of the transaction in relation to Student Loan Xpress' inclusion on ... lender lists raises suspicion and, at least, creates the appearance of impropriety," Burgdorf said in his report. Burt should have sold the stock or at least disclosed that he owned it and recused himself from any decisions about Student Loan Xpress, Burgdorf said. Burt sold the stock in 2005 for at least $18,000. When the investigation began last month, Burt said his previous ownership of the shares had no connection to Student Loan Xpress's position on the preferred lender list. "They are on our lender list for the same reason the other 19 are on the list. They provide the best package of benefits to students," he said. Burgdorf said the preferred lender list was flawed because Burt alone had the authority to add or remove companies and he often did so with little or no explanation. He recommended that the university establish objective criteria for the list and that managers be required to disclose their relationships with any entities involved in the student lending industry. Charles A. Sorber, former president of the University of Texas of the Permian Basin, was named interim director of the financial aid office starting May 29.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/katrina_opportunity	New Orleans neighborhood rescues itself - Yahoo! News New Orleans neighborhood rescues itself By JOHN MORENO GONZALES, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 2:09 PM ET NEW ORLEANS - Paul Pablovich was the very picture of a good neighbor as he shoveled debris off the curb and mowed other people's lawns in Lakeview, a middle-class section of town that was swamped with 15 feet of water during Hurricane Katrina and is now a patchwork of gutted and newly built homes. But he wasn't doing it entirely out of the goodness of his heart. He was protecting his investment. Pablovich, an entrepreneur who lived in a different part of New Orleans before Katrina, bought a bungalow on the street from an elderly resident after the storm, renovated it and plans to live there with his fiancee. He purchased a second abandoned house for $107,000, fixed it up and hopes to resell it for $214,000. He would like to "flip" several other properties on the block, too. The way he sees it, capitalism is the road to recovery for Lakeview. "It's how the country was built," Pablovich, 38, said of the $600,000 he has pumped into the real estate market. "Free-market economics will kick in." Lakeview, a 7,000-home mostly white enclave in a city that is predominantly black, has emerged as a success story in the reconstruction of New Orleans through entrepreneurs like Pablovich and strong civic organization that existed long before the storm. In contrast, hard-hit black middle-class neighborhoods in eastern New Orleans do not have the same financial means and civic organization, and are not drawing nearly as much private investment. As a result, their recovery is crawling. "If you're going to speculate, you're much more likely to speculate in Lakeview than you would in the east," said Louisiana State University sociology professor Jeanne Hulbert. "But you could end up, potentially, with a social and economic structure in the city that really carves out the black middle class." Nearly 21 months after Katrina, Lakeview has lights and other utilities, but still has no firehouse and no public school. But it is a community so fiercely independent it tried in the 1990s to secede from the city. And its residents &#151; who include business executives and other professionals &#151; have considerable organizational skills. Lakeview's churches arranged for volunteers around the country to plant trees along Canal Boulevard, the main drag. And recently, nearly 1,000 original and potential new residents came to a civic association tutorial on how to navigate the city's bureaucracy and find a reputable contractor. In fact, the civic association drew up a list of recommended contractors by running credit checks on them and consulting the Better Business Bureau. The group is so organized it has compiled its own data on rebuilding, finding in a February survey that 67 percent of Lakeview's lots were in some stage of transformation. Seventeen percent were newly inhabited, just over 26 percent were under repair, and 23 percent had been demolished to pave the way for rebuilding. In contrast, neighborhood leaders in eastern New Orleans, which encompasses four ZIP codes to Lakeview's one, are just now undertaking a house-to-house count. Independent research, at first glance, suggests Lakeview and eastern New Orleans have rebuilt at similar rates. GCR and Associates Inc. found last week that based on utility hookups, close to 36 percent of residents in the Lakeview ZIP code were back, versus 33 percent in the eastern New Orleans ZIP codes. However, Richard Campanella, associate director of Tulane and Xavier universities' Center for Biomedical Research, found that the flooding in Lakeview was, by some measures, far more severe. For example, nearly 22 percent of homes in Lakeview got more than 8 feet of water, compared with 3.5 percent in eastern New Orleans. Lakeview has eclipsed eastern New Orleans in real estate sales since Katrina. Sixty-nine houses were sold there nine months before the disaster, compared with 147 during the past nine months of recovery, a 113 percent jump. In eastern New Orleans, 215 single-family homes were sold in the nine months before Katrina, and 287 during the past nine months, a 33 percent increase. As he painted over the rust on an iron fence that ringed his family's home in eastern New Orleans, Hank Long said it was obvious to him that his part of town was rebuilding with sweat equity more often than financial equity. "In Lakeview, many of those houses were already paid for. A lot of people are still paying their mortgages here," said Long, a 60-year-old black man. "Nobody has big money here. They gutted out their house, and that's as far as they got. Whatever they could do, they did on their own." Hulbert of LSU said: "You have to remember the black middle class only took hold in the 1960s. That is different from several generations of middle-class life. Many middle-class blacks in New Orleans were the first in their families to go to college, and it appears many had their entire savings tied up in their homes." David Bell, president of the East New Orleans Neighborhood Advisory Commission, which formed in March to bind together 15 area groups, said a lack of private investment means eastern New Orleans is much more dependent on government recovery aid, with all the bureaucracy and politics that entails. For example, a centerpiece of the eastern New Orleans redevelopment plan is a proposed $100 million shopping strip. But federal grants for the project will not be fully released until the city comes up with 10 percent. Back in Lakeview, residents like to say that they ask mostly one thing of the city: for it to get out of the way. TKTMJ Inc., a builder that is selling modular homes in the neighborhood, found the area so profitable that it established an office in Lakeview and has dubbed one of its designs "The Lakeview." Tommy Callia, a sales representative with the company, noted that most of those able to rebuild are middle class and white. "I think we're not going to be as diverse as we once were, and that's going to be sad," he said. "You can say it's a little like a gumbo: If you don't have all the ingredients, something is missing in the taste."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070515/ap_on_re_us/eric_rudolph	Extremist taunts his victims from prison - Yahoo! News Extremist taunts his victims from prison By JAY REEVES, Associated Press Writer Mon May 14, 11:28 PM ET BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - Victims of Eric Rudolph, the anti-abortion extremist who pulled off a series of bombings across the South, say he is taunting them from deep within the nation's most secure federal prison, and authorities say there is little they can do to stop him. Rudolph, who was captured after a five-year manhunt and pleaded guilty in deadly bombings at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and a Birmingham abortion clinic, is serving life in prison at the "Supermax" penitentiary in Florence, Colo. Housed in the most secure part of the prison, he has no computer and little contact with the outside world aside from writing letters. But Rudolph's long essays have been posted on the Internet by a supporter who maintains an Army of God Web site. The Army of God is the same loose-knit group that Rudolph claimed to represent in letters sent after the blasts. In one piece, Rudolph seeks to justify violence against abortion clinics by arguing that Jesus would condone "militant action in defense of the innocent." In another essay about his sentencing, Rudolph mocks former abortion clinic nurse Emily Lyons, who was nearly killed in the 1998 bombing in Birmingham, and her husband, Jeff. He uses pseudonyms rather than naming the couple, but there is no doubt he is describing them. Rudolph recalls how Emily Lyons, in court, described the pain of her injuries and made an obscene gesture at Rudolph as she showed off a finger mangled by the blast. Rudolph writes: "It was a great speech and one that the denizens of freedom should be proud to enshrine in a museum somewhere. Perhaps they could put it next to MLKs `I Have a Dream.' They could call it `I Have a Middle Finger.'" Jeff Lyons said he doesn't often look at the Web site, which has had some items posted for nearly two years. But he said he is worried that Rudolph's messages could incite someone to violence against abortion providers. "He's still sending out harassing communication. He's still hurting us," Lyons said. Diane Derzis, who owns the Birmingham clinic that was bombed, killing a police officer, said someone should stop Rudolph. Bureau of Prisons regulations give wardens the right to reject correspondence by an inmate for "the protection of the public, or if it might facilitate criminal activity." That includes material "which may lead to the use of physical violence." The Bureau of Prisons failed to respond to repeated inquiries from The Associated Press about whether Rudolph's writings violate prison rules. But U.S. Attorney Alice Martin, who helped prosecute Rudolph for the Alabama bombing, said there is nothing the prison can do to restrict Rudolph or the supporter who keeps posting his writings, anti-abortion activist Donald Spitz of Chesapeake, Va. "An inmate does not lose his freedom of speech," she said. Spitz said he corresponds regularly with Rudolph and posts some of his essays because of their shared desire to end abortion. As for those who might be offended, he said, "They don't have to look at it on the Web site." John Hawthorne, whose wife, Alice, was killed in the Olympic bombing, said he isn't bothered by Rudolph's essays. "As far as I'm concerned he's out of sight, out of mind," Hawthorne said. "I don't mind him saying whatever he's going to say as long as they keep him locked up." Supermax has a capacity of 490 and holds some of the nation's most infamous inmates, including Unabomber Theodore Kaczyinski and Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui. A Justice Department report last fall criticized the prison for not properly screening inmate mail. It determined that three men convicted in the World Trade Center bombing were able to send dozens of letters overseas to suspected terrorists. Texas youth prisons suspends 4 more AP via Yahoo!

Wallace shooting fades By BEN EVANS, Associated Press Writer Tue May 15, 9:30 AM ET LAUREL, Md. - Many of Laurel's older residents can point to the precise spot in the shopping center where Arthur Bremer's gunshots paralyzed Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace and cut short his campaign for the White House in 1972. They recall just what they were doing that May 15 afternoon when they heard that the loner from Milwaukee had shot Wallace five times as he shook hands in the parking lot of what was then the city's main retail plaza. But 35 years later, as Laurel struggles to retain its small-town identity, the collective memory of its most famous event is fading. "People say it happened over near the bank, but other people say it was over there" by the drug store, said Scott Branch, standing behind the counter of the Hobby Works store he manages in the Laurel Shopping Center. Branch said he frequently uses the shooting as a landmark in giving directions to the store. But with the younger set, "I tell them it's where the Books-A-Million is and they say, 'Oh, I know where that is.'" Wallace, who had carried five Southern states as a fist-shaking third party candidate in 1968, was mounting a surprisingly successful run in the Democratic primaries in 1972 before Laurel. Billing himself as the candidate of "the average American," he was viewed as a serious wild card in the party and in Republican President 's bid for re-election. A former segregationist, Wallace was best known for standing defiantly at the all-white University of Alabama in a symbolic face-off with the Justice Department as the National Guard stood by and two black students enrolled in 1963. By 1972, he had tempered his racist rhetoric and adopted a more subtle approach, denouncing federal courts over the "involuntary busing" of schoolchildren to meet desegregation orders and pledging a return to a "law and order" society. Wallace had consistently fared well in polls and a few weeks before Laurel had led the crowded Democratic field in the presidential primary in Florida, where he carried every county. Even as he lay in the hospital after the assassination attempt, he led in Maryland and Michigan. But the shooting effectively ended his national career, diminishing the fiery charisma that had made him a dominant political force in Alabama and leaving him in a wheelchair until his death in 1998. There has never been much discussion of erecting a public marker on the site, city spokesman Jim Collins said. Even though Wallace ultimately apologized and asked forgiveness for his segregationist stands, a memorial would probably meet opposition because of his past, Collins said. Views might be different had Wallace died at the site, he said. Memorials are more common at sites where historical figures died, such as John F. Kennedy in Dallas or the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis. There is no marker, for example, at the Washington hotel where President Reagan was wounded in a 1981 shooting. Michael Brey, who owns the Hobby Works store, said a simple marker might be appropriate. But he said it could be tricky. "How do you do it without making it seem like it's a monument to a man who stood out in front of a school blocking black children from attending?" he said. Today, Laurel hardly resembles the small mill town it once was. Growth from the nation's capital about 20 miles to the south has surrounded the city with suburbs, and a busy commercial district with fast-food restaurants and car dealerships now dwarfs the strip center where Wallace was shot. No one seems to know what happened to the wooden stage that the shopping center would roll out for community events and that Wallace stood upon to deliver his stump speech before wading into the crowd. The bank that sits alone in the middle of the parking lot &#151; and is closest to the shooting site &#151; once displayed a large photograph of the scene in the lobby. But the national chain that bought the bank took it down years ago. "I heard about it when I first opened my account," said 20-year Laurel resident Dianne W. Shields as she left the bank recently. "They had (the photo) posted right there in front. You couldn't miss it ... everybody would talk about it." Wallace's family has never considered requesting a marker at the site, said Wallace's son, George Wallace Jr., a former Alabama Public Service commissioner who lost a bid to become lieutenant governor last year. If the local community wanted one, the family wouldn't object, he said. But it isn't planning to get involved. "Time passes, memories fade. It's part of life," he said. "It is a very historic site though. It sure is." (This version CORRECTS spelling of Brey.)

News World mayors hold climate summit in NYC By SARA KUGLER, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 26 minutes ago NEW YORK - City leaders from around the world declared at an environmental summit Tuesday that they can no longer wait for national governments to reverse global warming and instead must find solutions on their own. Mayors from Seoul to Sao Paulo and Albuquerque to Addis Ababa gathered at the summit, hosted by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former President , to exchange ideas on how their cities have gone green. "We cannot sit around and watch our environment deteriorate and put this world in jeopardy," Bloomberg said. "The public wants action, and if you have a void, the mayors are going to fill that void." Mayors and local leaders from more than 30 cities kicked off the conference, known as the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit, which first met in 2005 in London. Clinton did not attend Tuesday but was expected to be there Wednesday. Organizers say cities bear a significant responsibility to address climate change because they generate 80 percent of heat-trapping greenhouse gases but cover less than 1 percent of the Earth's surface. "It is in cities that the battle to tackle climate change will be won or lost," London Mayor Ken Livingstone said. The meeting comes at a time when many countries are struggling to address global and national standards for carbon reduction. This week, U.N. delegates are meeting in Germany to gear up for December negotiations on a new set of international rules for controlling greenhouse gas emissions. The new accord would succeed the Kyoto Protocol, which ends in 2012. When the Group of Eight major industrialized countries &#151; the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and Russia &#151; meet in Germany in June, climate change will also be on the agenda. Meanwhile, the mayors said Tuesday, local governments can't wait around. "Where national governments can't or won't lead, cities will," Toronto Mayor David Miller said. Douglas Palmer, mayor of Trenton, N.J., and president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said 500 of the nation's mayors have now signed the group's climate agreement, a pledge that is in line with the Kyoto Protocol. That 1997 international treaty requires the industrialized countries that signed it to cut emissions by 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012; the U.S. did not join the pact. Throughout the first day of the conference, which ends Thursday, participants attended panels on various topics, from water use to transportation. In a discussion on transportation, the mayor of the Brazilian city of Curitiba described his city's solutions, which include a bus rapid transit system, while Livingstone described London's program to reduce traffic by charging motorists extra money in the city center. Bloomberg recently announced his intention to begin a similar traffic charging program in Manhattan. London traffic congestion dropped by 20 percent, and carbon emissions in the central zone similarly decreased, Livingstone said. The fee &#151; equal to about $16 &#151; has gone up since it started in 2003. "People may not like paying the 5 pounds a day, but they certainly didn't want to live with that style of congestion," Livingstone said. He said his city's next goal is to charge more for higher-polluting cars, a pricing scale that could mean a $50 equivalent charge for the worst offenders. Summit organizers invited business leaders to the gathering in an effort to involve the private sector. They hope to convince them that going green &#151; through innovative construction, transportation alternatives and other environmental changes &#151; is profitable.
