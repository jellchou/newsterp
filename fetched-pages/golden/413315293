http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/entertainment/6703721.stm 'was on drugs' court told 31 May 2007, 07:32 GMT 08:32 'was on drugs' court told Michael is currently touring Europe Pop star George Michael had a cocktail of drugs in his system when he was arrested in his car last year, a London court has heard. The singer, whose real name is George Panayitou, has admitted driving while unfit, but says his condition was due to "tiredness and prescribed drugs". The 43-year-old was arrested in October 2006 after motorists reported a driver slumped over the wheel of a Mercedes at traffic lights in north London. Sentencing has been put back to 8 June. Prosecutor Andrew Torrington told Brent Magistrates' Court in north London that tests showed a therapeutic quantity of an anti-depressant in the singer's system as well as the illegal dance club drug GHB. Cannabis was also found in his blood, but the prosecution do not maintain that this was the cause of his intoxication. Michael (left) began his pop career as a member of Wham! The star's lawyer claimed a sleeping drug was the most likely explanation for his condition. He also told the court it was common for traces of GHB to be found in the blood even if the drug had not been taken. Prosecutors agreed that, while GHB is a banned class C drug, its effects could be created by other substances which are not controlled, including a drug called GBL. District Judge Katherine Marshall said the issue at stake was not the drug involved, but the condition Mr Michael was in when he was discovered in his car in October last year. The BBC's Ben Ando, who was at the hearing, said it was made clear that the star could expect to be sentenced at the "upper end of the scale for this offence". Mr Michael, who was not present, has already pleaded guilty to driving while unfit under the influence of drugs, which carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail. At a court appearance earlier this month, the former Wham! frontman addressed District Judge Katherine Marshall directly, saying: "I did something very stupid and I am very ashamed since doing it. "I'm not used to defending myself in a position where I am ashamed of something." He added: "I really have been very distressed by this whole thing. I am perfectly aware that I did something very wrong and got into my car when I was unfit to drive." Since his court appearance, Mr Michael has revealed he is addicted to prescription drugs and believes the world would be a better place if more people smoked marijuana. He will attend Brent Magistrates' Court to receive his sentence on 8 June, one day before he performs the first concert at the new Wembley stadium. After the hearing Michael said in a statement: "I have accepted throughout this affair that I was not in a fit state to have been driving a motor vehicle in the early hours of 1 October 2006 and accordingly pleaded guilty to the charge of driving whilst unfit through drink or drugs before Brent Magistrates' Court on 8 May 2007. "I am delighted that at today's hearing the court accepted that the proper approach to my case is that which I have always maintained, in that I was unfit through a combination of tiredness and prescribed drugs, and that I will be sentenced on this basis. "I would like to conclude by saying I am really looking forward to playing Wembley Stadium on 9 and 10 June."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6699847.stm over TV kidney competition 29 May 2007, 10:44 GMT 11:44 over TV kidney competition The show comes from Big Brother creators Endemol A Dutch TV station says it will go ahead with a programme in which a terminally ill woman selects one of three patients to receive her kidneys. Political parties have called for The Big Donor Show to be scrapped, but broadcaster BNN says it will highlight the country's shortage of organ donors. "It's a crazy idea," said Joop Atsma, of the ruling Christian Democrat Party. "It can't be possible that, in the Netherlands, people vote about who's getting a kidney," he told the BBC. The programme, from Big Brother creators Endemol, is due to be screened on Friday night. Specialists in kidney transplants have condemned the programme The 37-year-old donor, identified only as Lisa, will make her choice based on the contestants' history, profile and conversation with their family and friends. Viewers will also be able to send in their advice by text message during the 80-minute show. The Dutch donor authority has condemned the show, as have kidney specialists in the UK. "The scenario portrayed in this programme is ethically totally unacceptable," said Professor John Feehally, who has just ended his term as president of the UK's Renal Association. "The show will not further understanding of transplants," he added. "Instead it will cause confusion and anxiety." I thought organ recipients were chosen on who is the closest match, not who the donor likes the most Steve Davies, Romford, UK Send us your comments Professor Feehally also pointed out that, under normal circumstances, two people would benefit from a donor, each receiving one kidney. "The set up of the programme bears no relationship to the way decisions are made about transplants in the real world," he said. "Living donors can choose altruistically to give one of their kidneys - usually to a family member. "If organs become available after someone dies, health professionals with access to detailed information about those waiting for a transplant make objective decisions about who should receive those particular kidneys." BNN chairman Laurens Drillich has defended the show The former director of TV station BNN, Bart de Graaff, died from kidney failure aged 35 after spending years on a transplant waiting list. "The chance for a kidney for the contestants is 33%," said the station's current chairman, Laurens Drillich. "This is much higher than that for people on a waiting list." "We think that is disastrous, so we are acting in a shocking way to bring attention to this problem." "For years and years we have had problems in the Netherlands with organ donations and especially kidney donations," agreed Alexander Pechtold of D-66, the Dutch social liberal party. "You can have a discussion about if this is distasteful, but finally we have a public debate," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. TV critics in the UK have expressed horror at the programme, but said such a show would be unlikely in Britain. "My first reaction, probably everyone's reaction, is that this is as dangerously near as we've got to a TV programme playing God," said Julia Raeside of the Guardian newspaper. "People may live or die on the result of a game show. It's a step too far. "I don't think this is anything to do with reality TV. It's just a crazy idea that would never play out over here." The outcry comes at a difficult time for production company Endemol, who were censured by Ofcom last week for their handling of the Celebrity Big Brother racism row. The Australian version of Big Brother has also drawn criticism for not telling a contestant that her father had died.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/6700323.stm | Sussex | Fury around Glyndebourne turbine 29 May 2007, 10:46 GMT 11:46 around Glyndebourne turbine Glyndebourne wants to site the turbine on Mill Plain Four environment groups have united to fight plans by Glyndebourne Opera House for a 70m (230ft) wind turbine. Glyndebourne wants to site the 850kw turbine on Mill Plain, between Ringmer and Glyndebourne in East Sussex. "The position in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Park designate is absolutely wrong," said Dr Tony Parker of the South Downs Society. Glyndebourne says the turbine will be a "landmark" which will reduce its carbon emissions by 71%. The South Downs Society is supported by the Council for National Parks, the Campaign to Protect Rural England and the Ramblers Association. "The reason the four rural protection groups have come together is because this represents a massive detriment to the South Downs without any perceivable impact on the carbon footprint," said Dr Parker. A windmill once stood on the proposed site, on Mill Plain, but Dr Parker said the turbine would be four times higher. "To put it in context, it would be higher than the clock face on Big Ben," he said. Glyndebourne chairman, Gus Christie, said the site was surrounded by trees, which meant the sound of the turbine would not carry as far as the opera house or the village of Ringmer. "In this day and age the careful siting of these turbines is vital to show we are doing our bit to combat climate change," he said. "With the terrible consequences of global warming, it is crazy to be obstructing one single turbine in one's field of vision." The planning application will be considered by Lewes District Council in July. travel and more from the BBC website for Surrey and Sussex Glyndebourne plans wind turbine 05 Jan 07 | Southern Counties Campaign to Protect Rural England Council for National Parks guilty of raid at jewellers Anger as squatters wreck church Red faces at police station theft

The show was made by the newly-created Thames Televison in 1968 as a more accessible rival to what it saw as the BBC's more 'staid' Blue Peter. Bastable, with Susan Stranks and Pete Brady, fronted the show from 1968 to 1972 before becoming a TV producer. He had suffered from emphysema in recent years and died from pneumonia at East Surrey Hospital. His second wife, Anita, said:"He had very fond memories of Magpie. Looking through his papers we came across some of the old scripts. "I never thought of him as a hoarder, but these obviously meant a lot to him."

Mystery still surrounds the death of Pakistan coach Woolmer, who was found in his hotel room just hours after the team was knocked out of the World Cup. Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt, known for his sensitive and provocative human dramas, told the AFP news agency that cameras would begin to roll in August. The film is provisionally titled Jannat, which means Paradise. Bhatt said it would be a love story set against the backdrop of international cricket. "Betting and match fixing will be brought to light and there will be songs," he said. No stars have been announced but newcomer Kunal Deshmukh is pencilled in to direct, with Bhatt taking a production role. He added: "Woolmer will not be named.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/entertainment/6698689.stm profit' from Big Brother vote 29 May 2007, 09:52 GMT 10:52 profit' from Big Brother vote Davina McCall recently said she would host Big Brother "until I die" Channel 4 has said it will not profit from phone lines on the eighth series of Big Brother, after controversy over its handling of a previous vote. It has halved the cost of taking part in the eviction process to 25p per call, with 15p spent on administration fees and the rest going to charity. This will help to keep the process "fair and transparent", Channel 4 said. It had to scrap a poll on Celebrity Big Brother in January after a mix-up in a vote involving housemate Shilpa Shetty. An on-screen graphic invited viewers to dial in and "save" her while a voiceover gave the same number to "evict" her. There was also controversy over the bullying of the Bollywood actress during that series. And TV regulator Ofcom has ordered Channel 4 to begin the new run of Big Brother on Wednesday by broadcasting an apology for "serious errors of judgement" in its handling of the row. However, police in Hertfordshire - where the show is filmed - have denied newspaper reports that they were to continually monitor this year's show in case of further incidents of racism or violence. "Hertfordshire Constabulary is not setting up a team of officers to monitor events occurring in the Big Brother house," they said in a statement. "Hertfordshire Constabulary will continue to police eviction nights as it has throughout the series. "This is paid for by Channel 4 and Endemol, and not by public funds." In a further change to the reality show's voting process, viewers will no longer be able to participate through text messages. This is because of the lack of time during live broadcasts for mobile phone operators to count and verify the votes in the way that Channel 4 demands. And all elements of voting will be monitored by an external law firm in future. This year's Big Brother house has been given a "topsy-turvy" design "The voting has been fair and transparent throughout Big Brother's eight years on air," said Andy Taylor, the managing director of new media at Channel 4. "Given the recent focus on the use of premium-rate phone lines on TV, we want to ensure the audience has absolute confidence in the evictions, which are absolutely integral to the show's success." This year has seen a number of controversies about the way that expensive voting systems are used by broadcasters. Shows including ITV1's GMTV and The X Factor, Channel 4's Richard and Judy, and the BBC's Saturday Kitchen have been named and shamed over issues such as letting viewers enter contests which they had no chance of winning. ITV recorded a 20% drop in income from premium-rate lines in March and April over previous months, for which it blamed a drop in consumer confidence. And regulator Icstis has since introduced tougher rules for TV quiz shows, which broadcasters must follow. shows hit by TV phone-in crisis - and what is being done Phone-in confidence fall hits ITV GMTV's quiz firm admits errors TV quizzes must be made 'fairer' Reprimand for X Factor vote error Missed TV quiz texts sparks probe Regulator sets new TV quiz rules Q&A: Premium rate phone lines Wake-up call over phone scams 'I spent £9,000 on TV quiz lines'

McGowan performed the stunt on London radio station Resonance FM, and shared his meal with fellow guest Yoko Ono. "To me it was, as an art piece, exhilarating," he said after the show. The artist's protest concerned the alleged mistreatment of a fox during a hunt led by Prince Philip in January. The RSPCA said the fox did not suffer. It's disgusting. It's really, really, really disgusting Mark McGowan on his dog dinner McGowan, who is a vegetarian, said he wanted his unusual meal to raise awareness about "the RSPCA's inability to prosecute Prince Philip and his friends". "We love our animals in Britain. Why is it then that we then allow people - especially people who are supposed to be ambassadors for this country - to treat animals with such disrespect?" The Queen is famously associated with corgis The corgi, which died at a breeding farm, was minced and cooked with apple, onion and seasoning. As he ate the meatballs, McGowan reported: "It's disgusting. It's really, really, really disgusting." The radio show's presenter, Bob Smith, said he was not convinced the meat came from a dog. But McGowan said: "It's stinky, it's white-looking, it's not like any meat I've ever seen." Some animal rights activists approved of the stunt. "The idea of eating a corgi will make many people lose their lunch," said Poorva Joshipura, director of the European arm of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta). "But foxes, who are hunted for so-called entertainment, are no less capable of feeling fear and pain. "Most of the British public will agree that it is high time the royals joined the rest of us who live in the 21st Century and opposed to cruelty to animals." The Royal Family has had a long association with corgi dogs. The Queen has a particular fondness for corgis, and they have the run of Buckingham Palace - even in the middle of formal state events. artist to eat corgi 29 halt artist's city lie-in 15 Nov 06 | West Midlands Artist lies down in city street 14 Nov 06 | West Midlands 'Running tap' artist to try again 19 Mar 06 | England Plug pulled on running water art 27 Jul 05 | Arts Nut reaches Downing Street 12 Sep 03 | London

The pair, who met when Piper appeared on Evans' TV show TFI Friday, married in Las Vegas five months later in 2001. They separated in October 2004. Evans, who is 17 years Piper's senior, famously wooed the teenage pop star with a Ferrari filled with roses, even though she could not drive at the time. Piper, 25, has insisted she will not seek any money from her ex-husband. Last year Piper revealed how she regretted not telling her parents in person about the wedding in Las Vegas, which reportedly cost £250 and was attended by six friends. Following the ceremony, the couple travelled for 18 months before returning to the UK where Piper kicked off her acting career with a role in BBC's The Canterbury Tales.

In a message on her website, the singer wrote that she "genuinely did not know what to do with myself" following her split from husband Kevin Federline. Spears, 25, entered a Malibu treatment facility in February after months of partying and a dramatic hair cut. Defending her behaviour, she said: "I think it is actually normal for a young girl to go out after a huge divorce". However, she denied her spell in rehab had been the result of "alcohol or depression". After completing her treatment in March, which she described as a "humbling" experience, Spears completed a divorce agreement with Federline and fired her manager Larry Rudolph. Fans grew concerned when Spears publicly shaved off her hair "I have had to cut so many people out of my life," the singer wrote on her website, adding that some of her friends had tried to take advantage of her wealth. "You never know another persons intentions or what another person wants. "I feel I was too open and looking for answers when I had it all to begin with." Spears is one of pop music's most successful artists, selling 31 million albums in the US alone. She has not released an album since her surprise marriage to Federline in November 2004, but is reported to be working on a new set of songs. In recent weeks, she has performed a series of short concerts in nightclubs around Los Angeles. The star has two children with Federline - eight-month-old Jayden James and Sean Preston, aged 20 months. The couple currently have joint custody under a temporary court order.

She admitted herself to an "intensive medical rehabilitation facility", according to a statement released by her publicist. Police said a "useable" amount of a substance thought to be cocaine was found in Lohan's car during her arrest. The 20-year-old has not yet been charged but is due in court in August. Lohan was arrested Saturday morning after her car mounted a kerb and hit a shrub on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles. A police spokesman said when officers arrived at the alleged incident, both Lohan and the vehicle were no longer at the scene. The car was then traced to a nearby apartment complex. The actress has already had one stint in a rehabilitation this year, spending a month at the Promises treatment centre in Malibu. Lohan had her first hit aged 11 in The Parent Trap.

The dress went under the hammer at a sale of film and entertainment memorabilia at Christie's in New York. The auction house said it had expected the dress to fetch $30,000 (£15,192). In December, a black Givenchy dress created for Hepburn as Holly Golightly in the 1961 film caused an auction frenzy, selling for £467,200. The pink cocktail dress is believed to have been a late addition to the film and was used in the scene where Golightly learns of her brother's death and smashes crockery in a fit of grief.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6698753.stm | Europe | Poland targets 'gay' Teletubbies 28 May 2007, 15:49 GMT 16:49 targets 'gay' Teletubbies Tinky Winky was once attacked by the late US Rev Jerry Falwell A senior Polish official has ordered psychologists to investigate whether the popular BBC TV show Teletubbies promotes a homosexual lifestyle. The spokesperson for children's rights in Poland, Ewa Sowinska, singled out Tinky Winky, the purple character with a triangular aerial on his head. "I noticed he was carrying a woman's handbag," she told a magazine. "At first, I didn't realise he was a boy." EU officials have criticised Polish government policy towards homosexuals. Ms Sowinska wants the psychologists to make a recommendation about whether the children's show should be broadcast on public television. Poland's authorities have recently initiated a series of moves to outlaw the promotion of homosexuality among the nation's children. Tinky Winky's psychological evaluation is being treated fairly light-heartedly by many people here. One radio station asked its listeners to vote for the most suspicious children's show. Some e-mailed in, saying that Winnie the Pooh had only male friends. Even Ms Sowinska has backtracked a little, insisting that she does not believe the Teletubbies is a threat to the nation's children. But the evaluation is still going ahead and her office can recommend that the show should be taken off the air. Poland was criticised recently after its education ministry announced plans to sack teachers who promote homosexuality. Last month the European Union singled out Poland for criticism in its resolution condemning homophobia in the 27-member bloc.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6700631.stm for BBC phone-in contests 29 May 2007, 12:48 GMT 13:48 for BBC phone-in contests The faked Blue Peter result was broadcast in November 2006 The BBC Trust has ordered a review of how the BBC uses premium rate phone lines after problems on two of its television shows. The BBC apologised after the results of a competition on Blue Peter were faked and Saturday Kitchen was criticised for not being clear a show was not live. The Trust accepted action was taken by the BBC but felt an independent review would help restore public confidence. An internal review has recommended tighter rules. Grave mistakes were compounded by serious errors of judgment Sir Michael Lyons, BBC Trust chairman The report from the BBC's director general found that while the vast majority of shows had used premium rate lines correctly, the exceptions had fallen "seriously" short of standards expected of the corporation. On one Blue Peter show a guest was asked to pose as a competition winner when entrants could not get through on phone lines because of a technical problem. Mark Thompson's report was particularly concerned that the incident was not referred to more senior management. It noted that the programme's editor had since moved to another role and extra training made available to staff. The mistakes on Saturday Kitchen - where viewers were encouraged to ring in to a pre-recorded show - were blamed on "loose scripting" and rules on approving scripts had been tightened. A wider review of programmes found no serious problems and no malicious intent in any procedures. However, a new system of guidelines to make sure any quizzes are appropriate and genuinely challenging is being put in place. And all "live" telephone competitions where a winner is selected within a half-hour show have been suspended. BBC Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons said the Blue Peter errors were particularly serious. "These grave mistakes were compounded by serious errors of judgment in not referring the matter to senior management," he said. The external review, which is expected to be completed in the autumn, will be led by Ron Neil, the BBC's former director of News and Current Affairs and author of the Neil Report, which looked into reporting in the wake of the Hutton Inquiry.

Last.fm founding member Martin Stiksel said it was an "exciting opportunity". Last.fm is one of the fastest growing online communities out there As part of the deal, Last.fm's managing team will remain in place and the site will maintain its own separate identity. Mr Stiksel said: "This move will really support us to get every track ever recorded and every music video ever made onto Last.fm. "With a strong partner like CBS, this is now within our reach." CBS Corporation has business interests in TV, web and radio. CBS radio is the largest radio group in the United States, with 179 stations in the top 50 markets covering news, rock, country and urban music. The firm's president and CEO Leslie Moonves said: "Last.fm is one of the fastest growing online communities out there." The web has helped revolutionise listening to music He said Last.fm's strength in building communities around music and syndicating content was "central to CBS". He added: "Their demographics also play perfectly to CBS's goal to attract younger viewers and listeners across our businesses." CBS is not the first major player to purchase up-and-coming websites for millions or even billions of dollars, prompting what some have called the second dot.com boom. In 2005 Rupert Murdoch's News Corp snapped up social networking site MySpace for $580m (£290m). And last year, search engine Google paid $1.65bn (£883m) for video site YouTube. Mr Stiksel said Last.fm would retain an independent identity. He said CBS was buying "great technology and a very vibrant, active community". "They want to move from a content company to an audience company giving the audiences control and learning from this and that's why Last.fm was their choice," he added. Being in London has helped us; it's the best place to do things with music full stop Mr Stiksel said he did not think that users would feel disappointed that a mainstream media firm had bought the site. "When we said revolution we mean that - we put the users in charge. CBS gets this. "They understand that consuming media is changing, the patterns are changing." As part of the acquisition, the Last.fm management team, including founders Felix Miller, Martin Stiksel and Richard Jones, will continue to independently run the online network Mr Stiksel said the deal proved that Web 2.0 companies did not have to be in the United States to succeed. "Being in London has helped us; it's the best place to do things with music full stop. It's the place that leads the world." The three founders will now be among the most successful - and potentially wealthy - Web 2.0 pioneers in the world. Mr Stiksel said: "The success of the site is the most important thing. With a strong partner we can add the features we always dreamed about."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6699675.stm plans Potter purchase as PM 29 May 2007, 07:22 GMT 08:22 plans Potter purchase as PM Mr Brown said summer was the best time for reading novels Gordon Brown has revealed that one of his first acts as prime minister will be to read the final Harry Potter book. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is published on 21 July, just three weeks after Mr Brown succeeds Tony Blair. Westminster commentators are predicting a flurry of political activity, but Mr Brown told BBC Radio 4 he had already drawn up a summer reading list. Mr Brown has called JK Rowling's books Britain's "greatest export", and says he wants his sons to read them one day. Both are still too young to read the novels. John is three, while Fraser celebrates his first birthday a day after the final Potter is published. Mr Brown was speaking to the Today programme from the Hay-On-Wye literary festival, where he is promoting his own book, Courage, about his personal heroes. "This summer, I think (I will read) Thomas Keneally, who's just brought out a new book which is about war and heroes," he said. "I will probably want to dip into JK Rowling, hoping that is something my sons will want to read later. "And I suspect I will have a look at Al Gore's book." Gore's polemic, The Assault on Reason, presents a critical assessment of the US Government's approach to policy-making. "I think reading, in the literal sense, broadens the mind," Mr Brown added. "It opens up to you ideas and themes and vistas that you otherwise would never really grasp. "Summer is the best time to read books."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/entertainment/6708449.stm rally round for Lohan 31 May 2007, 14:42 GMT 15:42 rally round for Lohan Lohan is back in rehab for the second time this year Producers of actress Lindsay Lohan's forthcoming film are re-working the schedule so the star can film her role when she has completed rehab. The 20-year-old, who was due to begin shooting Poor Things this week, sought treatment after being arrested following a car crash at the weekend. Police said they found a substance thought to be cocaine in her car. Co-star and producer Shirley MacLaine said "in the spirit of helping" Lohan, they were trying to re-arrange filming. "We wish her love and the blending of mind, body and spirit," the statement added. Lohan was arrested on Saturday after her car mounted a kerb on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. She was not charged, but is due to appear in court in August. It is not the first time the star's personal life has caused problems with her film career. Last July, studio executive James G Robinson went public with a letter to Lohan, scolding her for repeatedly showing up late on the set of Georgia Rule. He called her behaviour "discourteous, irresponsible and unprofessional", and cited her "ongoing all-night heavy partying" as the reason for her tardiness. It is the second time the star has checked into rehab this year. She spent a month at the Promises treatment centre in Malibu in January.

The 54-year-old was suspended over allegations he insulted fans during a drunken trip to a restaurant in March. The soap's producer, Steve Frost, said: "After 10 great years we feel we have reached the end of the road with storylines for Les." Jones said he has had a "fantastic time" but wants to move on. "I have already had some very exciting offers and am looking forward to what the future holds," he said. The character will not be seen back on screen, but ITV has yet to decide how the character's absence will be explained. In a statement, ITV said: "It is likely to be linked to the departure of his wife Cilla - actress Wendi Peters had already decided to leave the show in September at the end of her current contract." At the moment Les is travelling as a roadie for a tribute band. The News of the World claimed the actor launched a foul-mouth tirade at the Old Rectory restaurant in Stockport, Greater Manchester. It was reported he insulted fans and discussed future storylines. Jones is understood to deny the newspaper allegations strenuously.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6703019.stm at Spector house 'homicide' 30 May 2007, 08:20 GMT 09:20 at Spector house 'homicide' Dr Pena indicated the path of the bullet that killed Clarkson US actress Lana Clarkson's death was a homicide, a coroner has told the murder trial of music producer Phil Spector. Dr Louis Pena said bruising suggested the barrel of a gun may have been forced into Ms Clarkson's mouth before she was fatally shot in 2003. Ms Clarkson was a hopeful person with no history of depression or suicide attempts, he told the court. Mr Spector, 67, is accused of killing Ms Clarkson at his Hollywood mansion. The defence says she shot herself. It says she placed the gun in her mouth and pulled the trigger. Dr Pena also told the court that there were bruises on Ms Clarkson's right arm and wrist but could not confirm the cause of the marks. Referring to the bruise on her tongue, he said it was "very unique and is consistent with blunt-force trauma. Something struck the tongue". Dr Pena said there was no evidence that Ms Clarkson had been preparing to kill herself and that she died with a purse on one shoulder, which, he said, was not typical of a suicide. "I found her to be a hopeful person from the notes I read," he said. Ms Clarkson had been taking two drugs generally given for depression at the time of her death, but her neurologist had prescribed them for her chronic headaches, Dr Pena said. Lawyers for Mr Spector say Clarkson killed herself In cross-examination, Mr Spector's lawyer Christopher Plourd sought to show that the coroner had relied heavily on the work of others in analysing the forensic evidence. Dr Pena conceded he was not an expert in gunshot residue or blood spatter and acknowledged he consulted textbooks in coming to his conclusions. Mr Spector pioneered the "Wall of Sound" recording technique in the 60s, working with stars such as The Beatles, Tina Turner and The Righteous Brothers. He is accused of killing is Ms Clarkson, 40, on 3 February 2003, hours after meeting her at the Sunset Strip nightclub House of Blues where she worked. If convicted, Mr Spector faces between 15 years and life in prison.

One of the actors is believed to have caught his leg in the moving stage during an early scene. The individual was not one of the lead actors, but the show was halted and the audience offered refunds. Performances are due to resume on Saturday. The £8m musical is currently previewing and officially opens on 19 June. The set involves a large hydraulic stage which can revolve, and be raised or lowered in sections. Audience member Tori Lowe said: "The hobbits were on stage and had a group of dancers dressed as rangers with them. "There was suddenly a lot of screaming, but at first we thought it might be part of the show. "But a stagehand came runnning on, and when the music stopped we could hear someone shouting 'My leg! My leg!'." In a statement, the producers said they were "looking at modifying the staging" so previews could resume. The three-hour production, at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, has a cast of 50 actors and acrobats. It has undergone a major rewrite since closing just six months after its premiere in Toronto last year.
