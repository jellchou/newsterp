http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/oxycontin_plea OxyContin maker, execs guilty of deceit maker, execs guilty of deceit By SUE LINDSEY, Associated Press Writer AM ET ROANOKE, Va. - The maker of the powerful painkiller OxyContin and three of its current and former executives pleaded guilty Thursday to misleading the public about the drug's risk of addiction, a federal prosecutor and the company said. Purdue Pharma L.P., its president, top lawyer and former chief medical officer will pay $634.5 million in fines for claiming the drug was less addictive and less subject to abuse than other pain medications, U.S. Attorney John Brownlee said. The plea agreement settled a national case and came two days after the Stamford, Conn.-based company agreed to pay $19.5 million to 26 states and the District of Columbia to settle complaints that it encouraged physicians to overprescribe OxyContin. "With its OxyContin, Purdue unleashed a highly abusable, addictive, and potentially dangerous drug on an unsuspecting and unknowing public," Brownlee said. "For these misrepresentations and crimes, Purdue and its executives have been brought to justice." Purdue spokesman James Heins objected to any suggestion of ties between the plea agreement and the abuse of OxyContin. "We promoted the medicine only to health-care professionals, not to consumers," he said in a statement. Privately held Purdue learned from focus groups with physicians in 1995 that doctors were worried about the abuse potential of OxyContin. The company then gave false information to its sales representatives that the drug had less potential for addiction and abuse than other painkillers, the U.S. attorney said. Ken Jost of the Justice Department's Office of Consumer Litigation said this case should put pharmaceutical companies on notice that they won't be able to get away with breaking the law to make a profit. "The things that they plot in their boardrooms, the things that they do behind closed doors will not stay behind closed doors," Jost said. "We have the people, we have the resources. We'll take the time and we'll take the effort to find out what they did and how they did it." Purdue Pharma said it accepted responsibility for its employees' actions. "During the past six years, we have implemented changes to our internal training, compliance and monitoring systems that seek to assure that similar events do not occur again," the company said in a news release. OxyContin, a trade name for oxycodone, is a time-release painkiller that can be highly addictive. Designed to be swallowed whole and digested over 12 hours, the pills can produce a heroin-like high if crushed and then swallowed, snorted or injected. From 1996 to 2001, the number of oxycodone-related deaths nationwide increased fivefold while the annual number of OxyContin prescriptions increased nearly 20-fold, according to a report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2002, the DEA said the drug caused 146 deaths and contributed to another 318. The U.S. attorney said the guilty pleas were entered Thursday morning in U.S. District Court in Abingdon, about 135 miles southwest of Roanoke. In an unusual move, Brownlee said, company chief executive officer Michael Friedman, general counsel Howard Udell and former chief medical officer Paul Goldenheim each pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of misbranding the drug. Of the total fine, $34.5 million was levied on those three. The fines will be distributed to state and federal law enforcement agencies, the federal government, federal and state Medicaid programs, a Virginia prescription monitoring program and individuals who had sued the company. About $5 million will go toward a six-year company program to monitor compliance with the agreement. When he took office in 2001, Brownlee said, his office was handling a number of cases related to OxyContin abuse, including crimes by addicts seeking to support their habits and arrests of street dealers and even pharmacists and physicians. "But it always seemed, I think to me and to the investigators, that there was more," he told a news conference. Investigators from a number of state and federal agencies worked together on an investigation of Purdue Pharma and began to subpoena company records in 2002, Brownlee said. "From these millions of records, they picked out probably 300 to 500 documents and pieced together a case," he said. Food and Drug Administration Food and Drug Administration was part of the investigation. A spokesman for Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the agency had not acted on a citizen petition Blumenthal's office filed more than three years ago. The petition raised concerns about misbranding and called for stronger warnings and fuller disclosure about OxyContin's dangers. Kim Rice of the FDA told the news conference that over time the agency has mandated increasingly stronger warnings on labels about OxyContin's abuse potential. Purdue Pharma recruited high-profile help in 2002 as the nation's number of oxycodone-related deaths rose dramatically. It hired former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's firm, Giuliani Partners, to try to prevent smuggling and abuse of the drug. "Purdue has demonstrated its commitment to fighting this problem in launching practical and novel solutions including the provision of tamper-resistant prescription pads to over 10,000 physicians and implementing its highly acclaimed `Painfully Obvious' teen education program," Giuliani said at the time.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/ivory Report: Illegal ivory imports on rise Illegal ivory imports on rise Thu May 10, 3:58 PM ET LONDON - Chinese-run smuggling rings based in Africa are responsible for illegal ivory imports nearly doubling in the past decade, according to a report published Thursday. The Cambridge-based wildlife trade monitoring watchdog Traffic International appealed to the Chinese government to help control the problem. "It is imperative that China reaches out to the growing Chinese communities in Africa with a clear message that involvement in illegal ivory trade will not be tolerated," said Tom Milliken, director of Traffic's Africa program. Worldwide, there are an average of 92 ivory seizures a month &#151; or three per day, the report said. Thirty-two seizures of 1.1 tons or more of ivory were recorded between 1998 and 2006, up from 17 between 1989 and 1997, according to an analysis by the watchdog of international elephant product seizure records. Markets in China are driving the demand for illicit ivory, which arrives either directly or through Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. Japan and Thailand are also important final destinations, and the Philippines is a key transit country. These seven countries and territories account for 62 percent of the ivory recovered in the 49 largest recorded seizure cases, the report said. The study identified the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Nigeria as major sources of illegal ivory. "With myriad conflict zones, Central Africa is currently hemorrhaging ivory, and these three countries are major conduits for trafficking illicit ivory from the region to international markets, particularly in Asia," Milliken said. Ivory trading threatens elephant populations by creating commercial incentives for poachers. The ivory is used mostly to make decorations or luxury items. "This demonstrates greater sophistication, organization and finance behind the illegal movement of ever larger volumes of ivory from Africa to Asia," said Susan Lieberman, director of the World Wildlife Fund's Global Species Program. "This is clearly a negative consequence of the ongoing globalization of African markets and economies." Traffic International monitors trade in endangered animals across Europe for the CITES Secretariat in Geneva.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/iraq_fighting_for_baiyaa Violence mars once calm oasis in Baghdad mars once calm oasis in Baghdad By HAMZA HENDAWI, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 7:55 PM ET BAGHDAD - Three months into Baghdad's security crackdown, sectarian violence is back on the rise &#151; this time, in a mixed neighborhood that had previously been relatively calm while Sunni-Shiite strife tore apart other parts of the Iraqi capital. Baiyaa, a middle-class district in western Baghdad, has started to display the fears and flight that have already carved up much of the city, which has become a patchwork of separate Sunni and Shiite enclaves. Snipers have begun appearing in parts of Baiyaa. Many stores have closed, and both Shiite and Sunni families have fled the area in recent weeks. Last Sunday, a car bomb devastated a food market, killing 30 people. The rumblings in Baiyaa have ominous implications for the U.S.-led security plan. They show that previously calm areas are still vulnerable to violence despite the flood of U.S.-Iraqi forces onto Baghdad's streets since February. The development also points to a troubling numbers game for Washington: whether plans for an additional 30,000 troops are even enough to cover the city of 6 million people and surrounding areas. Baiyaa offers lessons in the challenges of deciding how to spread the forces. The neighborhood had been relatively calm and was not seen as a hotspot for the security plan, which seeks to restore order in Baghdad to give politicians room to compromise. In the early days of the security sweeps, American troops came into Baiyaa in large numbers and patrolled on foot, according to residents. But U.S. forces significantly scaled back by March and ventured only occasionally into Baiyaa, which is on the road leading to Baghdad's international airport. Security was left mostly in the hands of the Iraqi military, dominated by the country's Shiite majority. "Things began to be a little unsettled in Baiyaa about two months ago," said Haidar Ahmed, a 34-year-old Shiite businessman, who packed his wife and three children into a minivan last Sunday and moved to Karbala, 50 miles to the south. "But the last two weeks have been really bad," he said by telephone. "We had a three-day stretch last week when we could not leave our homes because of the fighting." The precise reasons for Baiyaa's troubles are not clear, but accusations are thick on both sides. Sunni politicians have accused the Shiite-dominated government of allowing Shiite militias to operate in Baiyaa and elsewhere. Members of three Shiite families that fled Baiyaa a few days ago claimed Sunni extremists had threatened them. Those residents of the neighborhood spoke by telephone on condition of anonymity because they fear reprisals by armed gangs. "There are not enough checkpoints," said Ahmed Kazim, a 34-year-old Baiyaa resident, blaming the May 6 market bombing on what he said were the lax searches by Iraqi soldiers of cars heading to the area. No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing &#151; one of the deadliest to hit Baiyaa since the war began four years ago &#151; but the blast may have been in retaliation for bombings and mortar barrages against Sunni parts of the neighborhood the week before. U.S. military spokesman Lt. Col. Scott Bleichwehl said security operations have been stepped up in the larger district that includes Baiyaa. The military has divided Baghdad into 10 districts, each with a permanent U.S.-Iraqi garrison, called a joint security station. The station for the Baiyaa district is in another neighborhood. Baiyaa, however, seemed ripe for trouble. Its dusty streets and low-slung houses borders areas where the Mahdi Army of anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr holds sway. Baiyaa has a Shiite majority but is also the main commercial center of the Sunni-dominated part of Baghdad on the west bank of the Tigris River. Baiyaa's Sunnis are mostly drawn from the Janabi clan dominant in areas south of Baghdad known as the "triangle of death" because of insurgent activity and attacks against Shiites. Baiyaa's Shiites have their roots in southern There's little sign of life in parts of the district these days. Mortar shells fired from a nearby Sunni area struck Shiite parts of Baiyaa on Monday, killing at least four people, residents said. The government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has struggled to respond, blaming the trouble in Baiyaa on al-Qaida and criminal gangs. Chief spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said those groups want to "create the impression" of a city torn by sectarian strife. One resident, who gave his name only as Abu Ahmed, or "Father of Ahmed," said violence flared after suspected Shiite militiamen assassinated a popular Sunni doctor last month. Another, who gave his name only as Abu Mohammed, or "Father of Mohammed," pointed to a raid last month by U.S. and Iraqi forces near a Shiite mosque that killed two militants. Much of the violence has been centered in the heavily Sunni northern part of Baiyaa &#151; possibly indicating a move by Shiite extremists to establish a corridor linking their neighborhoods and control access of roads to Baghdad's airport and Shiite holy cities in southern Iraq. The Sunni militants, on their part, are keen to check the growth of what is becoming a large swath of Shiite presence in the heart of their territory. "There is just not enough troops in Baiyaa to take charge of the situation," said Sunni lawmaker Nasir al-Ani. "We are in constant contact with the security forces to try and stop the violence." To reassure the public, the Iraqi commander of the Baghdad operation toured parts of Baiyaa on foot Monday &#151; wearing a helmet and body armor and surrounded by dozens of heavily armed soldiers. "Baiyaa has been calm for a long time," Maj. Gen. Abboud Qanbar told reporters "But the last five days have seen terrorists moving into the area to stir trouble."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/fired_prosecutors Ex-U.S. attorney questions own firing attorney questions own firing By MATT APUZZO, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 50 minutes ago WASHINGTON - A former West Virginia federal prosecutor said Friday the White House fired him in 2005 in the middle of a corruption and vote-buying investigation but never told him why. Karl K. "Kasey" Warner said he has "concerns" and sees parallels between himself and eight other ousted U.S. attorneys. Congress and an internal Justice Department agency are investigating whether those firings were politically motivated. The Justice Department rejected any suggestion of politics in Warner's dismissal. "The notion that the termination was political is absolutely false," spokesman Dean Boyd said. "We encourage Mr. Warner to provide the department with a written privacy waiver and we will be happy to provide you with the reason for his removal." Warner would not elaborate on what concerned him about his August 2005 firing but rejected the idea that he was fired over his performance. "The facts speak for themselves. Look into how I ran my office. See how I managed the office," Warner said. "If they want to look at the cases I had and the corruption cases we have now, people can come to their own conclusions about why I was let go." Warner said he refused to resign when asked by the Justice Department, responding that he took his direction from "Next thing I know, I get a letter from the president's counsel, Harriet Miers, saying I'd been fired, no reason given," Warner recounted in a telephone interview. A state legislative audit later revealed e-mails in which Warner had offered to secretly contribute to a 2004 county political campaign. "Let me try to steer some contributions your way (gently) and perhaps use a family member with a different last name to make my contribution," Warner wrote in one July 2003 e-mail, according to the audit. Warner said he never followed through on the offer and discounted that as a reason behind his departure. Warner was nominated by Bush in 2001 to serve as the top federal prosecutor in southern West Virginia. The heavily Democratic district is the center of the state's coal industry. Bush carried the state in both 2000 and 2004. Almost immediately Warner made public corruption and vote-buying cases a priority, sometimes to the ire of Democrats who accused him of targeting them for political purposes. Warner's brother Kris was the Republican state party chairman, and his brother Monty ran for governor. Some former U.S. attorneys such as New Mexico's David Iglesias said Republican politicians pressured them to rush public corruption investigations in election years. Warner would not comment on whether he received any such pressure and would not say who was being investigated when he was fired. "Speaking generally," he said, "in my mind, if you want a good justice system, you don't remove U.S. attorneys to thwart ongoing criminal investigations." Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has denied that politics influenced hiring and firing decisions. And though Gonzales has apologized for mishandling the controversy, he has rejected calls from lawmakers to step down. The Justice Department has also said it never tried to influence an investigation for political reasons. An internal probe is under way. Warner's statements came on the heels of those by former western Missouri U.S. Attorney Todd Graves, who said he was forced out in March 2006. Graves said he fell out of favor with the Justice Department after refusing to cooperate with the filing of a Missouri voter fraud lawsuit a year before the 2006 election. Congress is holding hearings on the eight other firings, and former Justice Department White House liaison Monica Goodling is shaping up to be a main witness. A federal judge approved an immunity deal for her Friday, allowing her to testify without fear of prosecution. Warner's statements echo those by former Maryland U.S. Attorney Thomas M. DiBiagio, who in March said he believed he was fired for investigating corruption in a Republican governor's administration. The Justice Department said DiBiagio was fired for writing e-mails calling for "front-page" corruption indictments before Election Day. Warner said that, if asked, he would cooperate with any investigation. But he said he has made peace with his termination and is not trying to become part of the Capitol Hill story line. That's why the former Army officer said he has not approached investigators. "Sometimes soldiers catch a bullet. If you're truly out there doing your job, if you're truly a leader, sometimes you catch a bullet," he said. "It might not be fair, it might not be right, it might be sad, but that's part of what you do. I caught a bullet. It's not something you cry about or complain about."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/spellings_student_loans Justice probes student lender payments probes student lender payments By NANCY ZUCKERBROD, AP Education Writer Thu May 10, 8:37 PM ET WASHINGTON - The Justice Department is reviewing an audit that found hundreds of millions of dollars have been improperly paid to a student loan company, House Education Committee Chairman George Miller ( Miller, D-Calif., made the review public during a hearing in which he pressed Education Secretary on her decision to ignore a recommendation by her department's inspector general, John Higgins, to recover an estimated $278 million. It's the IG's audit that Justice is reviewing. A Justice Department spokesman declined comment Thursday. Spellings defended her decision not to recover the improper payments to the lender, Nebraska-based Nelnet, saying it was prudent to simply extract a promise from Nelnet that it would halt the practice, avoiding a costly lawsuit. Some lawmakers were skeptical. "Do you not have confidence in your inspector general?" asked Rep. John Tierney ( ), D-Mass. "I'm extremely uncomfortable with this." Spellings also traded barbs with Miller over allegations that the department's oversight of the student loan industry has been lax. Miller said the department failed to do its job when it came to uncovering improper relationships between student lenders and colleges or student loan officials at those colleges. He pointed to a 2003 notice from Higgins' office urging the department to curb inducements made by lenders to colleges or their staffs. Miller said the department promised it would keep an eye on such activities, a response he called inadequate. Spellings countered that the department has done what it could under existing law. "We monitor these programs vigorously," she said. "Who is monitoring? Do they have blinders on?" Miller asked. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has been leading an investigation into the $85 billion-a-year student loan industry. He has found evidence that some colleges received a percentage of loan proceeds from lenders given preferred status by the schools and found college loan officers got gifts from lenders to encourage them to steer borrowers their way. Cuomo said Thursday he had reached a $3 million settlement with Student Loan Xpress, Inc. and its parent company CIT Group Inc. Student Loan Xpress also agreed to cooperate with the investigation into potentially improper stock transactions. Cuomo's investigation revealed that the former CEO of Student Loan Xpress, Fabrizio Balestri, sold or transferred securities to financial aid officers at several colleges and to Matteo Fontana, a senior Education Department official who was recently placed on leave due to the disclosure of his stock holdings. Cuomo previously reached similar agreements with Citibank, Sallie Mae, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Education Finance Partners. The congressional hearing came a day after the House overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill that would ban gifts from lenders to schools and impose strict controls on schools that publish approved lender lists to guide students to certain loan companies. Spellings called the vote "an important first step in this process." But she also noted that she was pushing through new regulations to protect against conflicts of interest. She said proposed regulations would be completed this month and would include a requirement of at least three lenders on any school's preferred-lender list, together with an explanation of how and why they were chosen. The rules also will spell out what is allowed and what is prohibited with regard to inducements from lenders to schools, she said. Spellings said her department has oversight only for loans made through the federal student loan programs in which the government guarantees the loans. She said she has no authority over the growing private student loan industry, in which the government doesn't make or guarantee the loans. She announced at the hearing that she was convening the chairs of other federal agencies that deal with banking and lending issues to help her examine the problems in this sector of the student loan industry. California Rep. Buck McKeon, the top Republican on the House Education and Labor Committee, came to Spellings' defense, saying she couldn't be "expected to be the ethics police for the nation's colleges."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/les_paul Guitar innovator Les Paul returns home innovator Les Paul returns home By EMILY FREDRIX, Associated Press Writer AM ET WAUKESHA, Wis. - Guitar legend Les Paul enthralled a hometown crowd at a concert that raised more than $100,000 for an exhibit on his life. The 91-year-old Grammy winner hadn't played in Waukesha in decades. Even though he claimed earlier he's never nervous before going onstage, he said, "I was lying. I'm nervous tonight." Wearing a blue turtleneck and black slacks, Paul dazzled the crowd with his playing and with stories from his long career Thursday night. During his 90-minute concert, he joined his jazz trio in playing tunes such as "Tennessee Waltz," "Lady Is a Tramp" and "Embraceable You" as the crowd paid rapt attention. After "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," Paul got emotional, telling the crowd it was his mother's favorite song. "You have no idea what it means to be back here," he said. At one point, he jokingly accused his piano player of missing a note but added that he's missed his share, too. "All the time I've been playing the guitar, the notes I missed, I say I'm saving them for the next album," he cracked. Paul said at an earlier news conference that his trip was stirring up memories, including the motivation to invent the solid-body electric guitar in the 1940s. He recalled coming home from a gig after an audience member told him his guitar needed to be louder. "I went home and I said to my mother, `I've got a critic and the critic has something to say. It's up to me to do something about it. So I'll make an electric guitar,'" he said. The invention caught on and helped Paul and his wife at the time, Mary Ford, record a series of hit records in the 1950s. Guitar-maker Gibson began mass-producing the Les Paul model in 1952. Many rock musicians became famous playing on the model. "Thank God the younger generation latched onto it and said, `Look what we got here,'" he said. Tickets for Paul's performance ranged from $300 to $375. All 350 tickets were sold, with all the money going to the Waukesha County Historical Society & Museum, which is raising money for the Les Paul exhibit. In March, Paul donated $25,000 to the museum. Paul is also known for developing recording techniques such as close miking, multitracking and use of echo and delay. He's credited with introducing the first eight-track tape player in 1950s and building an early model synthesizer. He's often called the "Wizard of Waukesha," though he said he's not sure where it came from. "I didn't create it. I don't care ... but if the shoe fits," he said with a laugh. Paul, who lives in Mahwah, N.J., has donated many artifacts and memorabilia for the planned exhibit, a $3 million project expected to open in 2010. Paul didn't need much warm-up time Thursday. He has played twice every Monday night with his trio at the Iridium Jazz Club in New York since 1996.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/food_contamination U.S. hatcheries got contaminated feed hatcheries got contaminated feed Thu May 10, 5:19 PM ET WASHINGTON - Fish feed made with a contaminated Chinese ingredient was distributed to about 120 fish hatcheries and farms, roughly split between the United States and Canada, officials said Thursday. U.S. officials said the risk to people from eating fish that ate the contaminated feed was very low. The feed, manufactured by Skretting Canada, used imported Chinese wheat flour, purchased from a second Canadian company, that was spiked with melamine and mislabeled as wheat gluten. Wheat gluten is a mix of two proteins obtained when wheat flour is washed to remove the starch. A second imported Chinese vegetable protein, sold as rice protein concentrate but also simply wheat flour, has been found to have been contaminated by melamine. The nitrogen-rich chemical typically is used to make plastics, but can skew tests to make ingredients like wheat flour appear more protein rich than they really are. Together, the two contaminated ingredients have led to the recall of more than 150 brands of cat and dog food. Scraps from those pet foods also were used to make some pig and chicken feed. Food and Drug Administration Food and Drug Administration said Skretting has 198 U.S. fish feed customers, although just 50 to 60 are likely to have received products made with the contaminated ingredient. Two of those customers apparently farm fish for human consumption, FDA officials said. The rest are fish hatcheries, including at least seven Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife facilities that use the feed as a starter diet for juvenile salmon and trout. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said Skretting supplied 57 fish hatcheries and farms in that country. The spiked wheat flour came from two Chinese firms. Neither remains in business, according to the FDA. A message left Thursday with Skretting Canada was not immediately returned.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/terror_privacy Bush's privacy board not doing its job? privacy board not doing its job? By HOPE YEN, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 8:37 PM ET WASHINGTON - The leaders of the Sept. 11 commission say a White House privacy board is not protecting civil liberties because it refuses to investigate allegations of illegal detention at Guantanamo Bay. "We urge they revisit the definition of their mission to include issues relating to the treatment of detainees," former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said in a telephone interview Thursday. He and former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean sent a pointed letter to the board this week outlining their concerns. "If they continue to hold to their position, we don't think they're doing their job," Hamilton said. Mark Robbins, the board's executive director, said board members had received the letter and would respond. The board's next meeting is Wednesday. The five-member White House privacy board began its work in March 2006 after a recommendation by the Sept. 11 commission. Last month, the board put out a 49-page annual report to Congress where it spelled out its mission and preliminary findings. Some of those conclusions are questionable and need fuller explanation, the Sept. 11 commission leaders wrote after reading the report. They cited the board's assertion it had no power to review the Bush administration's plans to limit lawyers' access to nearly 400 detainees deemed as "enemy combatants" at Guantanamo Bay, as well as allegations of torture and coercive interrogation at the Cuba facility, because the incidents were not taking place on U.S. soil. The American Bar Association has criticized "arbitrary restrictions concerning the number of times and the ways that lawyers may confer with their clients in Guantanamo." The limits would threaten competent representation without at all advancing national security, according to the lawyers' group. "We cannot speak to an audience, foreign or domestic, on the question of civil liberties without the topic of Guantanamo coming up," Hamilton said. "To ignore those and say they are not within the mandate is a too restrictive reading." Also troubling was the board's conclusion that two of the administration's most controversial surveillance programs &#151; electronic eavesdropping and financial tracking &#151; do not violate citizens' civil liberties, the commission leaders said. Hamilton and Kean also said they want to know more about the board's efforts to review the 's use of national security letters. Earlier this year, a lengthy audit by the Justice Department's inspector general found that agents sometimes demanded personal data on people without official authorization. Both conservative and liberal civil liberties groups have urged the privacy board to aggressively review the administration's surveillance policies. They have questioned whether the board was sufficiently independent enough to stand up to the president if he were flouting the law. Bush appointed Republican Carol Dinkins, a Houston lawyer and former Reagan administration assistant attorney general, to head the board. A longtime friend of the Bush family, she was treasurer of Bush's first campaign for governor of Texas, and is a partner in the law firm of Vinson & Elkins, where Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was once a partner. The panel's other GOP members are vice chairman Alan Raul, a Washington lawyer, and former Solicitor General Theodore Olson. Commissioner Lanny Davis, a former Clinton White House counsel, is the lone Democrat. Former Ambassador Francis Taylor is an independent. On Thursday, Hamilton said he and Kean realized the job of the privacy board was difficult but that the protection of civil liberties required a "strong and robust voice." "We hope the questions are constructive in nature. We also want the board to know there are those of us who are looking carefully at their work," Hamilton said.

Modified to have a attribute for better module consistency. to allow specifying categorization scheme. for a human readable label. element for media binary hashing. to distinguish formatting of text. Improved descriptions of various elements and attributes. 08/22/2005 - Improved global syndication capabilities: [1.1.0] attributes to media:text and media:content. to give more flexibility to represent things other than people or companies. to explicitly determine what type of media is expressed. Added a "Best Practices" section to encourage use of the Feed History module, and Dublin Core's expiration capability. Add time code information to 10/22/2005 - Minor improvements: [1.1.1] Added capability for elements to appear at the to allow explicit global relationships to be expressed. The namespace for Media RSS is defined to be: "Media RSS" is a new RSS module that supplements the enclosure capabilities of RSS 2.0. RSS enclosures are already being used to syndicate audio files and images. Media RSS extends enclosures to handle other media types, such as short films or TV, as well as provide additional metadata with the media. Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of . It allows grouping of elements that are effectively the same content, yet different representations. For instance: the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3 format. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media. It contains 14 attributes, most of which are optional. should specify the direct url to the media object. If not included, a element must be specified. is the number of bytes of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the standard MIME type of the object. It is an optional attribute. is the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable). While this attribute can at times seem redundant if is supplied, it is included because it simplifies decision making on the reader side, as well as flushes out any ambiguities between MIME type and object type. It is an optional attribute. determines if this is the default object that should be used for the . There should only be one default object per . It is an optional attribute. determines if the object is a sample or the full version of the object, or even if it is a continuous stream (sample | full | nonstop). Default value is 'full'. It is an optional attribute. is the kilobits per second rate of media. It is an optional attribute. is the number of frames per second for the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of samples per second taken to create the media object. It is expressed in thousands of samples per second (kHz). It is an optional attribute. is number of audio channels in the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of seconds the media object plays. It is an optional attribute. is the height of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the width of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared. If this element is not included, it assumes that no restrictions are necessary. It has one optional attribute. r (cz 1 lz 1 nz 1 oz 1 vz 1) is the URI that identifies the rating scheme.

The keywords and phrases should be comma delimited. kitty, cat, big dog, yarn, fluffy Allows particular images to be used as representative images for the media object. If multiple thumbnails are included, and time coding is not at play, it is assumed that the images are in order of importance. It has 1 required attribute and 3 optional attributes. specifies the url of the thumbnail. It is a required attribute. specifies the height of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the width of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the time offset in relation to the media object. Typically this is used when creating multiple keyframes within a single video. The format for this attribute should be in the DSM-CC's Normal Play Time (NTP) as used in RTSP [ RFC 2326 3.6 Normal Play Time ]. It is an optional attribute. NTP has a second or subsecond resolution. It is specified as H:M:S.h (npt-hhmmss) or S.h (npt-sec), where H=hours, M=minutes, S=second and h=fractions of a second. A possible alternative to NTP would be SMPTE. It is believed that NTP is simpler and easier to use.

If the media is operating under a Creative Commons license, the Creative Commons module should be used instead. It is an optional attribute. Allows the inclusion of a text transcript, closed captioning, or lyrics of the media content. Many of these elements are permitted to provide a time series of text. In such cases, it is encouraged, but not required, that the elements be grouped by language and appear in time sequence order based on the time. Elements can have overlapping times. It has 4 optional attributes. Oh, say, can you see By the dawn's early light specifies the type of text embedded. Possible values are either 'plain' or 'html'. Default value is 'plain'. All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/nasa_telescope_dc Hubble telescope successor on target telescope successor on target Thu May 10, 4:36 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The James Webb ( ) Space Telescope, intended to peer deep into the cosmos from beyond the moon, is progressing well in development and is on track for a planned June 2013 launch, officials said on Thursday. Edward Weiler, head of NASA&#39;s Goddard Space Flight Center, said after cost overruns a couple of years ago, the project has met every technical, cost and schedule milestone for the past 20 months. The launch date already has slipped from 2011. The Webb telescope is envisioned as the first of a new generation of space observatories, set to orbit nearly a million miles from Earth to allow scientists to look further into the universe than ever before in five decades of space exploration. Scientists hope the new telescope can collect data on the early universe after the Big Bang, and on planets outside our solar system, including evidence of whether life might exist on them. and Northrop Grumman Corp., the defense contractor building the telescope, described its progress during an outdoor news conference on the National Mall. "We&#39;re making excellent progress in meeting all of our plans and commitments for a mid-2013 launch," said Martin Mohan, Northrop Grumman&#39;s program manager, adding that NASA has endorsed all 10 new technologies developed for the telescope. Standing in the shadow of a full-scale model of the telescope measuring 80 feet long, 40 feet (12 meters) wide and 40 feet tall, Mohan said, "There&#39;s engineering to do, but invention is done, more than six years ahead of launch." Weiler said the telescope will cost &#36;4.5 billion including development, deployment and operations through 10 years after launch. He said Hubble has cost between &#36;7 billion and &#36;8 billion, adding that the Webb project is far ahead of where Hubble was at a similar time in development in the 1980s. The Webb telescope will be more powerful and capable than the aging Hubble, which has greatly expanded the understanding of the cosmos since its launch in 1990. The Webb is due to be placed in a more distant orbit beyond the moon. The Webb telescope will be given a primary mirror whose surface is about six times the size of the one on Hubble. It will also have infrared-sensing cameras and spectrographs. The future of Hubble is in doubt because the space shuttle program is winding down in the coming years and the telescope needs manned maintenance missions to continue operations. The Webb will not be as serviceable by astronauts as the Hubble but is being designed so that a future spacecraft can dock with it to try to correct simple problems, Weiler said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/heart_gene_dc Gene switch helps mice fix their own broken hearts switch helps mice fix their own broken hearts Thu May 10, 4:37 PM ET CHICAGO (Reuters) - Researchers have figured out how to switch on a gene in adult mice that repaired their hearts after a heart attack, a finding that may one day help fix heart damage in humans. The team at Columbia University Medical Center in New York found that by genetically manipulating a gene associated with cell growth, adult mice were able to make new cells to replace those damaged in a heart attack. Heart cells in mice, and in humans, stop regenerating after birth. If the heart is damaged by a heart attack, it cannot create new cells to repair the damage and hearts become less efficient at pumping blood. "Heart cells don&#39;t divide at all in the mammal heart, and that&#39;s why we have so much mortality and morbidity," said Dr. Hina Chaudhry, whose study appears in the journal Circulation Research. Chaudhry and colleagues studied the gene cyclin A2, a gene that is active in embryos, but shut off in adult mammals. "We genetically engineered these mice to keep expressing this gene that becomes silent after birth," she said in a telephone interview. The researchers then induced a heart attack in the mice. At three months, the mice whose cyclin A2 genes had been switched on had 77 percent better heart function than the other mice. "The mice who did not carry the gene were progressing to heart failure and dying," she said. "We didn&#39;t lose any of the mice that carried the gene. They had much better survival." "We&#39;re the first study to show a sustained improvement in cardiac function by any kind of molecular or cellular manipulation," she said. Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in people older than 65, a condition that affects nearly 5 million Americans.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/securities_fraud Couple pleads guilty to insider trading pleads guilty to insider trading By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 11:57 PM ET NEW YORK - A married couple, both lawyers, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud Thursday in what was described as one of the biggest insider-trading operations since the 1980s, a $15 million scam that reached into some of the nation's top financial firms. Randi Collotta, 30, a former employee of Morgan Stanley and Co. in Manhattan, and her husband, Christopher Collotta, 34, who worked in private practice, were among 13 people who were criminally charged in the case. The couple received $9,000 in kickbacks for inside tips that generated more than $600,000 in illegal profits, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Fish said. In a plea deal with the government, Randi Collotta agreed not to appeal any sentence as long it's between one and 1 1/2 years in prison. Christopher Collotta vowed not appeal any sentence from 10 months to a year and four months in prison. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero set sentencing for Sept. 7. They remain free on $250,000 bail each. Randi Collotta, sobbing through much of the proceeding, said she agreed in September 2004 with her husband to provide inside information she obtained in her job at Morgan Stanley to a broker, Marc Jurman of Palm Beach Garden, Fla. Jurman pleaded guilty in March to conspiracy and securities fraud. He was also named in a Securities and Exchange Commission Securities and Exchange Commission complaint earlier this year. She said she told her husband about pending mergers and acquisitions between September 2004 and July 2005. "I knew my husband would share the information with Marc Jurman," she said. She added: "I understood my actions were wrong and I accept responsibility for what I did." Fish said Jurman shared that inside information with others, resulting in several hundred thousand dollars in illegal profits beyond $38,500 Jurman pocketed after trading securities based on what the Collotas had told him. After the plea, Randi Collotta declined to comment. Her lawyer, Kenneth Breen, said, "Randi Collotta accepted responsibility for what she did and today took a significant step in putting this behind her." Christopher Collotta, like his wife, said in court that he knew he acted illegally and accepted responsibility. He declined to comment outside court as well. His lawyer, Brian Rafferty, issued a statement outside court saying his client "deeply regrets his actions in participating in these offenses, and realizes that he will have to live with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life." The government said the trading ring relied on insiders at Morgan Stanley and UBS Securities LLC to steal valuable secrets from the companies. It also alleged a Banc of America Securities LLC broker accepted kickbacks and that two former representatives of Bear Stearns & Co. obtained proprietary UBS information. The SEC has described the case as one of the most pervasive Wall Street insider trading rings since Ivan Boesky and Dennis Levine engaged in notorious insider-trading schemes during the 1980s. According to prosecutors, Randi Collotta was an associate in Morgan Stanley's global compliance division during the conspiracy. When they announced the case in March, prosecutors and SEC officials said the defendants included registered representatives, compliance personnel and hedge fund portfolio managers who traded hundreds of tips over five years. U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said Wall Street professionals repeatedly traded on secrets revealed to them by insiders at UBS and Morgan Stanley. Stock upgrades and downgrades by UBS and impending corporate acquisitions involving Morgan Stanley clients were relayed before the news hit the market, authorities said. The SEC said ringleaders working the UBS side of the scheme went to great lengths to hide their actions through clandestine meetings, disposable cell phones and secret codes. At least three people have already pleaded guilty to charges in the case and await sentencing. Meanwhile, Jennifer Wang, who also worked at Morgan Stanley, and her husband, Ruben Chen, of Englishtown, N.J., were charged Thursday in an unrelated insider-trading case with conspiracy and securities fraud. Prosecutors said Wang made $600,000 on secrets she stole from Morgan Stanley while she was a vice president. She and Chen, a vice president at ING Investment Management Americas, resigned after investigations began. After a brief court appearance late Thursday, Wang and Chen were each released on $2 million bail. Chen is required to submit to electronic monitoring. A defense lawyer did not immediately return a telephone call for comment.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/immigration_congress Reid extends negotiations on immigration extends negotiations on immigration By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 51 minutes ago WASHINGTON - Agreeing to give a fitful set of bipartisan talks more time to yield an immigration deal, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( ) said Friday he would delay a vote on the issue until next Wednesday. The move postponed &#151; at least for a day &#151; what was shaping up as a partisan clash over immigration after weeks of negotiations between the White House and senators in both parties designed to strike a broad compromise. With that agreement still elusive, Reid is planning to force debate next week on an immigration measure that passed the Senate last year with wide Democratic backing but opposition by a majority of Republicans. GOP senators have promised to block that move, saying they will only accept a new bipartisan compromise. "Some of the senators feel that there's a breakthrough that could take place" in talks over the weekend and early next week, said Reid, D-Nev., adding that he would "reluctantly" postpone the test-vote, which he had set for Tuesday. He has now set the vote for next Wednesday. Sen. Mitch McConnell ( ), R-Ky., said the move would "give us the maximum opportunity to piece back together the bipartisan agreement that we thought we almost had a week or so ago." Talks are continuing on the possible deal, which would first secure the U.S.-Mexico border and implement an elaborate high-tech identification system for immigrant workers, and only then give millions of illegal immigrants a chance at legal status &#151; after waits as long as 13 more years. Many Democrats and Republicans are wary of such an agreement, which also would limit immigrants' ability to bring their families to the U.S. Democrats fear it will be rejected as too punitive by their liberal base, while Republicans are concerned about alienating conservatives by appearing to treat illegal immigrants too leniently. plans to use his Saturday weekly radio address to urge Congress to reshape immigration laws.

In a statement, the military said a series of raids against car bomb cells took place in and around Baghdad and the northern city of Mosul over the past two days. Nine militants were detained. The four were killed on Friday near Taji, north of Baghdad, the statement said. The militant with suspected links to al Qaeda was a car bomb cell leader, the military said. It said U.S. forces approached a building during the raid, when soldiers were fired upon by the four. Troops returned fire, killing them, it said. U.S. and Iraqi forces launched a security crackdown in Baghdad in February that has cut sectarian death squad killings. But car bombs mainly blamed on Sunni Islamist al Qaeda still plague the city, killing and wounding scores each week. U.S. commanders say they are making it a priority to go after car bomb networks, while putting up tall concrete barriers around popular targets such as markets to minimize attacks. In an interview with Reuters this week, the commander of U.S. troops in Baghdad, Major-General Joseph Fil, said his forces were making headway. "Although we are still seeing car bombs, where they are being directed has changed significantly," he said. "The effect of the car bombs has been reduced hugely, they are not getting to markets anymore because they are not allowed. They are not getting to many of the neighborhoods that they used to go because they are just denied that opportunity." U.S. military officials say the number of car bombs in Baghdad has fallen by 41 percent during the three months of the security offensive compared to the same period before the plan.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/usfirecaliforniaisland Wildfire rages on US nature reserve off California coast rages on US nature reserve off California coast AM ET LOS ANGELES (AFP) - A wildfire erupted on an island nature reserve off the California coast on Thursday, sending firefighters from the mainland scrambling into boats to tackle the blaze, officials said. The fire tore through more than 400 acres (161 hectares) of brush in a rugged area of Santa Catalina Island, with massive plumes of smoke visible more than 80 kilometers (50 miles) away in downtown Los Angeles. Firefighters were being shipped to the island on boats, while the US Navy was sending two hovercraft to carry five engines, officials said. Local media said the island&#39;s main town of Avalon was being partially evacuated as the flames bore down. Residents had been ordered to gather on the town&#39;s beach, fire captain Mike Brown said. Four Los Angeles County fire helicopters were on the scene, fire officials said, while an airplane from the Forestry Department was also deployed. Catalina, which has a population of just under 4,000, is a famed wildlife reserve which is popular with day-trippers from Los Angeles. The island is home to 15 species of plants and animals not found anywhere else in the world. The fire comes after a blaze devastated more than 325 hectares (800 acres) of Los Angeles&#39; historic Griffith Park earlier this week.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ucgg/putpressureonchinatoimproveitsfoodsafety PUT PRESSURE ON CHINA TO IMPROVE ITS FOOD SAFETY PRESSURE ON CHINA TO IMPROVE ITS FOOD SAFETY Thu May 10, 7:56 PM ET WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Several years ago, I was doing research on how different ancient cultures had looked at the cats they found among them. Many of those cultures -- the Egyptian, the Siamese, the Burmese, the Japanese and the Turkish -- considered cats to be royal and sacred creatures, representative of the deepest spiritual yearnings of their societies. But when it came to the Chinese vs. the Japanese, I was surprised at what I found. All through their history, the Japanese depicted their little bobtail cats in the most exquisite aesthetic terms; they graced great paintings and their statues sat on the altars of Buddhist temples. But how different the Chinese were, even then! For across the board, even while they used it as decoration on their vases, the Chinese saw the cat only in terms of "How many mice can it catch?" It was a utilitarian creature and, later, a target of cruel consumption. I could not help but think of this early warning about Chinese attitudes toward animals these last few weeks as the pet food scandal broke, with unregulated Chinese products poisoning innumerable American and Canadian cats and dogs. And when you have gone through a market, like the one I saw in Chungking, with pitiful dogs lining up to be slaughtered -- or you hear about the special "raccoon dogs," which are literally skinned alive for their pelts -- you can only come to the conclusion that we really must stop treating China as some civilized country with whom we want to continue to do "business as usual." The pet food scandal was revealed several weeks ago because of the sudden deaths of countless pets through liver poisoning; it was subsequently discovered that a number of Chinese firms were using a white, gypsum-like substance called melamine to provide cheap bulk to pet food -- bulk that approximated protein in examination but was instead also poisonous. But that was only the beginning. Now the poisoned Chinese food chain has reached out across the world well beyond the recall of 60 million (as of now) packages of pet food: catfish illegally contaminated with antibiotics; counterfeit glycerin that is named as the cause of at least 365 deaths in Panama; chickens that had to be destroyed because of tainted Chinese food; severe malnutrition in Chinese children from fake milk powder; soy sauce made from human hair; cuttlefish soaked in calligraphy ink to improve their color, and eels fed contraceptive pills to make them grow longer and slimmer. I recall, on the many times I've been to China, that I would occasionally ask exactly what it was that we were eating. I don't know now whether I'm glad or sorry that they often smiled oddly ambiguous smiles and seldom answered the question. Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the U.S., adds that the United States should be watching the fur issue. "The Chinese are trying to sell a lot of fur in the U.S.," he told me, "like trim for parkas. There are two big issues. They advertise it as faux fur but, in the cases we know about, it turned out to be the fur of domestic dogs. ... There are few limits on what they do in China. They badly need an internal animal welfare group. There have been internal outcries about the killing of dogs for food, and we surely protested. But theirs is a totally consumptive view of animals." We are, of course, talking about a huge market. China's agricultural exports to the United States surged to $2.26 billion last year, according to U.S. figures, which is more than 20 times the $133 million of 1980. The U.S. has a $232 billion trade deficit with China, and so has put itself in the position of an economic supplicant rather than a world power. The country's financial reserves are $1.2 trillion as of this writing, and growing at $1.2 billion a day. So what exactly can the United States, Europe and other affected countries do against a country whose lack of regulations and laissez-faire attitude toward food standards could be poisoning us all, pets and humans alike? Actually, plenty! Above all, China seeks a place in the world alongside the big, industrialized societies. We must tell China that it will not get that place until it begins to abide by the rules of the Big Boys. This can be done through innumerable international organizations, as well as tough private diplomacy. Individual consumers could stop buying Chinese porducts. Get the American Chamber of Commerce in China, which has acted shamelessly, not as America's trade representative in China but as China's lobby in America, off its duff. Write to it; embarrass it. Send pictures of poisoned pet dogs and cats and suggest, not kindly, that it start shaming the Chinese for their heartlessness. Support efforts by the budding young elite classes in China, who are now getting their own pets, to start a humane society. Shame them, too. Suggest to them that they study the cases of Singapore, where the once-disdained little "drain cats" have been bred into the beautiful "Singapura" breed, now the national cat of Singapore, or Turkey, where the Angoras and the Turkish Van cats are the national cats of that country. Meanwhile, work here to get family pets named officially as "members of the family." This started with Katrina, when FEMA and other rescuers left family pets to die, breaking the hearts of untold thousands. Because there was such an outcry, that will not happen again, but there is a major discussion now going on in the nation as to how much of a family member a beloved cat or dog is. Civil judgments increasingly acknowledge the emotional value of pets to humans, for instance, and cruelty to animals is a felony in 42 states. Were this trend even stronger, people who lost pets to Chinese negligence, corruption and greed would be in a far stronger position to bring legal action against the pet food companies and perhaps the Chinese parties themselves. Until then, when you go to China, enjoy the art and the physical beauty of the country, but look deeply into the eyes of the people and talk "pets." Don't give them a moment's peace. They don't deserve it.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/nuclear_treaty_dc Iran, NAM countries downgrade atom treaty text NAM countries downgrade atom treaty text PM ET and other developing nations cast a cloud over global nuclear disarmament efforts on Friday by downgrading the final statement of a two-week review meeting. Diplomats said their move dealt a symbolic blow to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty at the outset of a new review cycle leading to a decision-making conference in 2010. Developing states said the meeting&#39;s summary dwelled unduly on noncompliance with NPT rules, singling out Iran at the behest of Western powers, while downplaying those powers&#39; obligation to phase out their nuclear arsenals. They also objected to a reference that delegates had called for intrusive snap inspections by U.N. inspectors to be made a condition for developing nations to receive nuclear fuel from rich nations for civilian atomic energy, they said. As a result of their objections the text, instead of being attached to a final report listing procedural decisions and position papers submitted, was relegated to the status of a "working paper" added to 77 others submitted at the gathering. "It gives the impression of a dying NPT, even though we will meet again next year to pick up the ball again," said one diplomat. "It&#39;s not the NAM as such that is causing this impasse, it&#39;s the Iranians playing terrible games," said a European diplomat. Iran had earlier paralyzed the two-week meeting for six days by blocking consensus for the agenda before accepting a minor semantic change to the text. Iran has been hit by U.N. sanctions for refusing to halt uranium enrichment, which world powers suspect is meant to yield atomic bombs not electricity as the Islamic Republic says, and for impeding U.N. inspector inquiries into his nuclear activity. "Serious concern was expressed over Iran&#39;s nuclear program and it was strongly urged to comply with all the requirements (in resolutions by the International Atomic Energy Agency International Atomic Energy Agency urging it to stop enrichment) without further delay," the summary by meeting chairman Japan read. "It was noted that these multiple unanimous Security Council resolutions ... demonstrate the resolve of the international community on this issue," it said. "For its part, Iran indicated its readiness, provided Security Council disengagement (from handling Iran&#39;s case) was realized, to resolve issues in the framework of the IAEA." Analysts said the chairman&#39;s summary tried to strike a balance by citing dismay among developing nations over the slowness of nuclear weapons powers to dismantle their arsenals in stages, as called for by the treaty. "We think the report is fair, balanced and representative. The precedent of rejecting the chair&#39;s text undermines standard multilateral practices, which sets a dangerous precedent for the NPT itself," said disarmament campaigner Felicity Hill. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the start of the review meeting the treaty was suffering a "crisis of confidence." &#39;s nuclear test in 2006, after bolting the NPT, and Iran&#39;s bid to enrich uranium in defiance of U.N. resolutions have put the treaty under unprecedented strain. The development of nuclear arsenals by two non-signatories, India and Pakistan, has further eroded its authority. The United States has been accused of double standards by embarking on nuclear cooperation with India. The NPT is also faltering from a perception among nuclear "have nots" that nuclear "haves" have restricted access to atomic energy for development and stalled on disarmament obligations.

LOS ANGELES, May 10 (Reuters) - The crisis that has swept the U.S. subprime mortgage industry may come down to a simple, three-digit number, multiplied by millions. Lenders in the midst of an unprecedented U.S. housing boom pared borrowing requirements to a minimum -- a single number, known as a "FICO score," that was supposed to reflect the borrower&#39;s ability to repay a mortgage. Traditional down-payment demands were dropped. Borrowers were taken at their word because checking a salary took too long. Proof of savings, housing history, a job -- sometimes these, too, fell by the wayside. Critics of the system argue scores are full of errors and dangerous to use alone. They also are easy to manipulate. A cottage industry has thrived helping prospective borrowers raise their scores without changing their underlying ability to repay a mortgage. "There are fundamental flaws in the system because people can manipulate characteristics to get the FICO score they would like to see," said Kevin Jackson, a strategist who follows mortgages at RBC Capital Markets in New York. The system can be played "to come up with the kind of mortgage for people who really couldn&#39;t afford a house." A credit score and a written, unchecked statement of income have often been enough to get a loan. That provided the fuel that kept the housing boom going as huge demand for homes met a seemingly endless and unchecked supply of money. "The combination killed the goose," said Bill Dallas, chief executive of Ownit Mortgage Solutions, a failed subprime lender headquartered in Agoura Hills, California. Subprimes are higher interest rate loans for lower-credit-quality individuals. Mortgage failures hit record highs at the end of last year and the housing industry is in crisis. Now, loans worth hundreds of billions of dollars could be in jeopardy. TRICKS OF THE TRADE The FICO scoring system takes its name from Minneapolis-based Fair Isaac Corp., the company that developed it in 1989. FICO scores have been used by credit-card companies, auto loan providers and mortgage lenders as part of a process to grant credit for billions in purchases. FICOs incorporate five types of information to calculate a score on a scale of 300 to 850. A score above 700 is strong, mid-600s is good for many, and 620 is clearly considered second-tier, or subprime. FICO has been embraced by the &#36;10 trillion U.S. mortgage industry as an objective, easy-to-use way to make the market more efficient and fair, and even after the demise of some two dozen lenders, it is the main lending criterion for many companies. "Now the banks don&#39;t want to hear letters of explanation. They just want to learn FICO scores," said broker Bob Moulton, president of Americana Mortgage Co. in Manhasset, New York. Lenders who focused too narrowly on FICO numbers often failed to see how the figure was being misused. "You can do a lot more than you should be able to do to a FICO score, a lot quicker," said Ownit Mortgage&#39;s Dallas, a real estate industry veteran. He said a FICO score can predict default but his company used scores as just one element in a complex set of factors used to approve loans. One problem with relying exclusively on credit scores is they are easily changed. Consultants are available to fix errors in credit reports and also offer tips to raise scores, undermining the system. For example, borrowing money to temporarily pay down debt can boost the score. Ironically, opening more credit card accounts can also increase their amount of available credit -- and sometimes can boost the score. Another common way to boost scores is to piggyback on a relative&#39;s good standing by getting added as an authorized user of their credit cards. That way, it appears the person has the same access to credit as the relative. Entrepreneurs are taking that idea a step further, making a business of buying and selling credit card accounts, or "tradelines." For &#36;1,500, addatradeline.com offers to connect a customer to another person&#39;s credit card with a &#36;15,000 limit and 10 years of payment history, creating the appearance of a solid borrower. "As long as there are banks out there that will score with tradelines, there will be a market for this," said Adam Wheeler, owner of the Orange County, Calif.-based addatradeline.com. Lenders bragged that credit scores were rising among borrowers in the midst of the housing boom. However, a rising level of delinquencies last year revealed growing problems with the system. The total of loan payments more than 60 days late by January had surged to record highs above 14 percent, up from near 6 percent in mid-2005, according to UBS Securities data. As more people joined the real estate industry, lenders won business with offers of more flexible loans, lower rates and faster turnarounds. Paperwork became the enemy of speed. Credit histories, part of the basis of a credit score, require some judgment and training to interpret, and decisions are subjective. Armed with FICOs, lenders gave questionable borrowers leeway, such as requiring less proof from self-employed professionals with no steady job or pay stub. The strong housing market, combined with the ability to resell almost any loan to investors, lulled lenders into a sense of complacency. Three large credit reporting companies -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- produce FICO scores based on their own refinements of the basic Fair Isaac system. BIG INCENTIVE FOR SMALL CHANGES Credit scores make a big difference and even small changes can mean real savings to consumers or much higher fees to lenders. A &#36;200,000 30-year fixed rate loan in California would cost a borrower with a 760 FICO &#36;1,182 per month, or &#36;364 less on each payment than for a borrower with a score below 620, according to myFICO.com, Fair Isaac&#39;s consumer-oriented Web site. Boosting scores has become a booming industry. Deborah Vasile, a Cape Coral, Florida, mortgage processor who went through a recent business bankruptcy, said her credit score rose more than 100 points after she paid about &#36;500 to Credit Repair Today of Tampa, Florida. Considering buying a new car and a home, Vasile said she heard the service could remove bankruptcies from records before the typical seven-year posting period expires. After several derogatory items were consolidated into a single strike against her, she&#39;s now house hunting. Elizabeth Warren, a professor at Harvard Law School, said she questions how an entire industry can be based on claims of quick fixes for a person&#39;s creditworthiness. "If credit repair can help someone alter a FICO score for people that can pay a fee, doesn&#39;t that say that a FICO score is not a very reliable indication of a person&#39;s financial status?" she said. HIGHER FICO, LOWER PAYMENT As the credit-scoring system grew larger, it became more prone to errors, critics say. Credit reporting companies process some 4.5 billion pieces of data every month, and some 79 percent of consumer credit reports contain errors, according to a 2004 report by the Federation of State Public Interest Research Groups. Congress in 1970 required that companies verify and correct incorrect information within 30 days, opening the door for a new industry of credit repair services that often hound credit bureaus to get information expunged. The credit rating companies question the tactics used by the credit repair firms that pressure them to change credit histories. Deborah Vasile said her credit repair service is on a fourth round of challenges on her behalf, attempting to remove the bankruptcy from her record. Carl Jensen, owner of Credit Repair Today, said his service pushes for deletion of "derogatory items" as allowed by consumer law. "Sometimes it&#39;s that repetition; it&#39;s just beating them down," Jensen said. Credit-repair companies have attracted plenty of criticism themselves, and shady businesses pop up all the time since there&#39;s little barrier to entry, Jensen said. Credit bureaus are also beginning to rule that signing up as an authorized user on someone else&#39;s credit account is not a legitimate practice, said Helayne Urban, a personal credit consultant in White Plains, New York. Experian no longer accepts such tradelines in its scoring, she said. Meanwhile, mortgage brokers, which launch some three-quarters of all subprime home loans, are finding new ways to boost scores in a short period of time. Ellie Mae, a private company that is the biggest provider of loan origination software for the country&#39;s 40,000 mortgage broker companies, plans to unveil the "Maximizer," a program that for &#36;25 spits out steps a customer can take to improve a credit score to a level that meets a lender&#39;s guidelines. In recent months, mortgage brokers have been clamoring for such tools as they struggle with tougher lending standards and a falling number of mortgages, said Mitch Freifeld, president of Branch Management Solutions in Clearwater, Florida. Mortgage originations will likely fall by 20 percent over three years to &#36;2.247 trillion in 2009, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, an industry group. Ideally, consumers would use suggestions from the Maximizer and credit consultants to improve their credit standing, and the higher scores would lead to more favorable loans. But Fitch Ratings suggests higher scores have become less relevant in predicting who will quit making payments. As evidence, they point out that the average FICO score on loans that defaulted within their first year was 615 last year, just 10 points less than on loans with current payments. The gap was a better indicator in 2003, when bad loans were scoring more than 30 points less than good ones, it said. In 2005, CreditSights, an independent credit research firm, said FICO scores have become an excuse to lead consumers into higher levels of indebtedness. Banks responded by displaying rising FICO scores as a panacea to calm concerns about future credit deterioration, the analysts said. The companies that issue the scores defend their products and say consumers only hurt themselves by omitting valid credit information. "It just means the consumer has an inflated credit-risk potential and may end up getting a loan they should not have had in the first place," said Stuart Pratt, president of the Consumer Data Industry Association in Washington, whose members include Fair Isaac and the three main credit reporters. Fair Isaac Chief Executive Mark Greene staunchly defends his system, but facing what he called an "emerging sense of hysteria" in March, he asked a deputy to remind lenders to use all available information in their loan decision-making. Some lenders may have lost faith in the system. In response to lenders&#39; demands, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion together developed a more predictive credit score model, according to Barrett Burns, who is chief executive of VantageScore Solutions, the collaborative effort to weed out inconsistencies between the companies. Lenders today might take a lesson from failed underwriters that may have ignored the details at their own peril. Executives from mortgage lender New Century Financial Corp. cited FICO scores to demonstrate the quality of their mortgage loan portfolio. On May 4, 2006, for example, New Century told investors and analysts its average FICO score was 633 at the end of the first quarter of 2006, up from 600 in 2003. "Credit performance is better than historical experience and has exceeded our expectations," the company&#39;s slide presentation said. Eleven months later, New Century filed for bankruptcy protection.

The US space agency unveiled in Washington on Thursday a full-scale model of the James Webb ( ) Space Telescope (JWST), a probe bejeweled with new technologies that will succeed the aging but invaluable Hubble telescope in 2013. Scientists hope the telescope, named after the man who ran from 1961 to 1968, will peer back to the first stars after the "Big Bang" and the formation of solar systems capable of hosting life. The telescope, a joint project of the US, European and Canadian space agencies, will be three times bigger than Hubble, with a hexagonal mirror 6.5 meters (21.3 feet) in diameter and five-layer sunshield the size of a tennis court. The probe being built by Northrop Grumman Corp. will incorporate 10 new technologies, including an infrared camera and a spectrometer kept at an extremely low temperature for optimum performance. The telescope is expected to have a 10-year lifespan. The model was put on display Thursday in front of Washington&#39;s National Air and Space Museum. Launched 17 years ago, Hubble revolutionized astronomy by peering deep into the universe, beaming back dazzling images free of the distortions from Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Orbiting 575 kilometers (360 miles) above Earth, the Hubble has enabled scientists to better measure the age and origins of the universe, observe distant supernovas, and identify and study bodies in and outside the solar system. While Hubble was able to peer back to one billion years after the Big Bang, officials said the new telescope, with mirrors that will capture six times more light than its predecessor, will look even further into the origins of the universe -- by seeing light emitted from even more distant objects that has taken hundreds of millions of years to travel this far. "Clearly we need a much bigger telescope to go back much further in time to see the very birth of the universe," Edward Weiler, director of NASA&#39;s Goddard Space Flight Center, told a news conference. Hubble, along with space telescopes Chandra and Spitzer, have shown that the universe is hiding many mysteries, but they are unable to solve them, said Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute near Washington. "We cannot penetrate the darkness of the time when the first galaxies were born," Mountain said. The current telescopes are also unable to provide answers about black holes and the enigmatic dark matter, he said. With its more powerful mirrors, the new telescope "for the first time will send images from that dark age, high resolution pictures," he said. The 4.5 billion dollar James Webb Space Telescope will be folded to fit inside a European Ariane V rocket in 2013 and will unfurl 1.5 million kilometers (0.93 million miles) from Earth. NASA plans to launch a space shuttle mission next year to upgrade and maintain Hubble in order to keep it operational through 2013. Without a repair mission, the telescope would shut down in 2009 or even earlier, dealing a blow to scientists who have relied on Hubble&#39;s images to better understand the universe. "Before Hubble humans could only imagine the universe," Mountain said. "Now they can see it."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/led_lighting LEDs emerge to fight fluorescents emerge to fight fluorescents By PETER SVENSSON, AP Technology Writer PM ET NEW YORK - The light bulb, the symbol of bright ideas, doesn't look like such a great idea anymore, as lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad are talking about banning the century-old technology because of its contribution to global warming. But what comes next? Compact fluorescent bulbs are the only real alternative right now, but "bulbs" that use light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, are quickly emerging as a challenger. LEDs, which are small chips usually encased in a glass dome the size of a matchstick head, have been in use in electronics for decades to indicate, for example, whether a VCR is on or off. Those LEDs were usually red or green, but a scientific breakthrough in the 1990s paved the way for the production of LEDs that produce white light. Because they use less power than standard incandescent bulbs, white LEDs have become common in flashlights. Established players in the lighting industry and a host of startups are now grooming LEDs to take on the reigning champion of residential lighting, the familiar pear-shaped incandescent light bulb. The light bulb has been running out of friends recently. California and Canada have decided to ban the sale of incandescent bulbs by 2012. Australia is banning them in 2010. The is looking at banning production of the bulbs. A U.S. Senate committee is working on a proposal that would phase out the light bulb in 10 years. And in New Jersey, where the first practical incandescent bulb emerged from Thomas Edison's laboratory in 1879, a bill has been introduced to ban their use in government buildings. Governments are gunning for the light bulb because it's much less efficient than fluorescents, using about five times more energy to produce the same amount of light. Lighting consumes 22 percent of electricity produced in the U.S., according to the , and widespread use of LED lighting could cut consumption in half. By 2027, LED lighting could cut annual energy use by the equivalent of 500 million barrels of oil, with the attendant reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas believed to be responsible for global warming. Much of that reduction would be possible with today's technology, using compact fluorescents, or CFLs. But consumers haven't warmed to them. The light quality hasn't been satisfactory, most take time to turn on and aren't dimmable. The LED has advantages over the CFL in most of those areas, and judging by this week's Lightfair trade show in New York, it could be a serious challenge to the CFL in a few years. What holds it back is chiefly price, but LEDs are already an economic alternative for niche uses. In the last two years, the diodes have doubled in energy efficiency and brightness, according to Greg Merritt, director of marketing for Durham, N.C.-based LED-manufacturer Cree Inc. In particular, LEDs that produce a yellowish or "warm" light similar to incandescents have improved. Dallas-based Lighting Science Group Corp. showed an LED "bulb" that screws into a standard medium-sized socket and produces a warm light equivalent to that of a 25-watt incandescent bulb, but consumes just 5.8 watts. It costs $50, hardly palatable to consumers who can buy a standard bulb for less than a dollar. Polybrite International, a startup in Naperville, Ill., announced that lighting giant Osram Sylvania, a subsidiary of Germany's Siemens AG, will distribute its LED "bulbs." The intended market is mainly commercial clients, who can afford to pay $15 to $85 per unit, according to Osram Sylvania marketing manager Constance Pineault. The energy efficiency is no doubt a draw for commercial clients like hotels, but LEDs have another big advantage: they last up to 50,000 hours, according to manufacturers. That compares to about 10,000 hours for fluorescents and 1,000 hours for incandescents. Not having to send out janitors to replace burned-out bulbs means big savings in maintenance costs. "Right now the applications that make sense are either high maintenance or high power consumption, like parking garages, where the lights are on all the time," said Cree's Merritt. LEDs already beat fluorescents for energy efficiency in some niche uses. For instance, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is putting LED lighting in its in-store refrigerators, where the cold dims fluorescents and incandescents produce too much heat. LEDs also starting to replace flat fluorescent backlights in liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs, where they produce better colors. LEDs don't contain toxic mercury, which CFLs do, though the amount is very small. (Recent stories circulating calling a hazmat team if a CFL breaks are exaggerated. The U.S. recommends sweeping up, not vacuuming, the fragments, then checking out local recycling options.) The cost of LED lighting should be coming down quickly. Polybrite founder Carl Scianna said the cost of individual white-light diodes, several of which go into an LED bulb and make up much of the cost, have come down in price from about $8 to $1.50 in a year. "They're going to keep going down," Scianna said. "By the middle of next year, they'll be priced for consumers." Nadarajah Narendran, director of lighting research at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., cautions that there are still technical issues to work out with LEDs. While single LEDs can demonstrate very high energy efficiency in the lab, when they're combined into fixtures, their efficiency is considerably lower. In part that's a heat issue: the diodes produce less heat than incandescents, but they keep that heat in the fixture rather than radiating it, and the hotter the diodes get, the less efficient they are. He sees screwing LED bulbs into standard sockets "as a waste of talent" that doesn't utilize the inherent properties of LEDs, like their small size and longevity. "You could build them in as part of the furniture, part of the cabinetry," Narendran said. Because of their high prices, he doesn't believe LEDs will be ready to replace incandescents in all their uses for the next five to 10 years, but "LEDs, good or bad, will be growing very rapidly."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/bush War tensions follow Bush to commencement tensions follow Bush to commencement By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer LATROBE, Pa. - Debate may be raging in Washington over whether the war should end. But Capitol Hill has nothing on tiny St. Vincent College, where gave the commencement address Friday amid protests and controversy. The normally tranquil campus in the lush hills of western Pennsylvania has been riveted by a lively discussion over whether the choice of Bush as graduation speaker was appropriate in light of the school's peaceful Benedictine traditions and the president's policy in Iraq. Bush was welcomed warmly, with cheers and applause filling the school gymnasium. School officials said there had never been as large a participation rate in a graduation ceremony. And the president didn't discuss the war in his remarks. "Thanks for inviting me. I am honored," Bush said, his normal greeting taking on extra meaning. But the passions over the four-year-old Iraq war that the president's visit has ignited were never absent, reflecting the debate now ongoing in the nation's capital and around the country. Ronny Menzie chose to join a protest on the road to the college instead of standing with her fellow graduates. "I didn't finish my thesis because I didn't want my graduation with him," said Menzie, 35, a philosophy major. "I think it's a blight, an embarrassment on a Catholic college." The invitation to Bush came from a former top adviser, Jim Towey, who ran the White House's Office of Faith-based and Community Initiatives until he became the school's president nine months ago. But St. Vincent, a Roman Catholic liberal arts college, is proud of its 161-year-old Benedictine heritage. The school also is located in the congressional district of one of Washington's fiercest war critics, Democratic Rep. John Murtha ( So critics spoke out, saying that having Bush address the Class of 2007 ran afoul of Catholic "just war" teachings and the school's values. The school held a forum &#151; broadcast on C-SPAN &#151; to allow students to voice their opinions. Nuns protested on the edge of campus several Sundays in a row. Some alumni threatened to cut off donations. Some 30 current and former faculty members wrote an open letter criticizing Bush on the war, the environment, the poor and the sick and saying that "linking the school to your administration would irreparably tarnish Saint Vincent." The local paper featured dueling op-ed pieces by a former president of the school and Towey, the current one. Supporters said it was an honor for the rural school of 1,800 and an unforgettable experience for graduates. Towey has said he knew the invitation would draw protests but defended it as a memorable experience for students and the perhaps once-in-a-lifetime chance "to hear the leader of the free world" no matter what they think of him. For his part, Bush focused on the importance of service. He encouraged graduates to consider careers in teaching or the military, and to make volunteering a regular part of their lives regardless. "Today I ask you to make service more than a line on your resume," he told the 300 graduates, surrounded by about 1,600 family, friends and teachers. "Find a need that's not being met. Do your part to fill it and make a difference to our country." Outside, about 150 people demonstrated, given encouragement by some drivers who cheered and honked as they passed. "I object to the president being here and speaking to the graduates of Saint Vincent. I don't think philosophically he stands for what the students of the campus stand for," said Tom Koziatek, 68, a 1960 graduate of Saint Vincent. Iraq war veteran Jonas Merrill, 25, said he drove 90 minutes from his home in Cumberland, Md. to protest Bush's arrival and the ongoing war in Iraq. "We're fighting for the guys still over there," he said. Associated Press writer Dan Nephin contributed to this story.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/iraq1_dc Bombers kill 26 in attacks on Iraqi bridges kill 26 in attacks on Iraqi bridges By Ibon Villelabeitia and Dean Yates 2 hours, 37 minutes ago BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Truck bombs exploded on three important bridges near Baghdad on Friday, killing 26 people and damaging two of the spans in an apparent attempt by insurgents to paralyze road links to the Iraqi capital. The attacks defy efforts by the U.S. military to smash car bomb cells and are the latest in a series of attacks on infrastructure around Baghdad, where U.S. and Iraqi forces have deployed thousands more troops under a three-month-old security plan. In England, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani said would need U.S. and British troops for another year or two. "I think in one or two years we will be able to recruit our own army forces and say goodbye to our friends," the president told students in a lecture at Cambridge University. Police said suicide truck bombers struck police checkpoints on two bridges in a Shi&#39;ite area south of Baghdad, killing 22 people and badly damaging one bridge. They said 60 people were wounded. An Iraqi army source said a truck bomb also hit a bridge near the town of Taji just north of Baghdad on the main highway connecting the capital with cities in the north. He said it was quickly followed by a car bomb that killed four soldiers there. The U.S. military said the bridge was impassable for northbound traffic. Last month, a truck bomb destroyed the Sarafiya Bridge in Baghdad. Days later a suicide car bomber blew himself up on a ramp leading to another bridge in the capital, which is bisected by the River Tigris. Politicians from both sides of the Shi&#39;ite-Sunni sectarian divide have accused insurgents of trying to split the capital of seven million people along sectarian lines. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has said his security forces will be ready to take control of the country by the end of this year, but Friday&#39;s attacks illustrate the challenges ahead in trying to drag Iraq back from the brink of sectarian civil war. A police source said eight policemen were among the dead in the attacks on the bridges south of Baghdad, but it was unclear how many casualties were caused by each blast. Police said the first bomber damaged the old Diyala Bridge. Minutes later, a few kilometers (miles) away, another attacker detonated a truck bomb on the new Diyala Bridge. The two bridges over the Diyala River, a tributary of the Tigris, are commonly used by Shi&#39;ite pilgrims on their way to holy Shi&#39;ite cities to the south. In Washington, debate over funding the war moved to the Senate after Democrats in the House of Representatives defied President George W. Bush President George W. Bush on Thursday by passing a bill that allows money to continue combat only for two or three months. Bush vetoed a &#36;124 billion war funding bill last week because it set a deadline for the withdrawal of combat troops. Senators appear more willing to give Bush the &#36;100 billion he wants at once, but it remains unclear how far they might go in setting binding "benchmarks" to measure progress in Iraq. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( ), Democrat of Nevada, said on Friday there was "new reason to believe that a bipartisan consensus on Iraq is emerging." Bush said he would back benchmarks but he and congressional Republicans do not want to spell out actions the United States would take if Iraqi progress in securing the country falls short. U.S. Democrats and some Republicans say Iraq&#39;s Shi&#39;ite government must reach out to minority Sunni Arabs and reduce sectarian violence if it wants U.S. forces to stay. Officials of Iraq&#39;s most powerful Shi&#39;ite party said on Friday it would make key changes to its platform, in a move that will increasingly align it with Iraq&#39;s top Shi&#39;ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. The changes could also distance the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) from neighboring Shi&#39;ite , where the party was formed in the 1980s to oppose the late President Underscoring the strain on U.S. forces as the Baghdad buildup nears its peak, one commander said he needed more troops in volatile Diyala province north of the city. "I do not have enough soldiers right now in Diyala province to get that security situation moving," said Army Maj. Gen. Benjamin Mixon, commander of forces in areas north of Baghdad.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/people_paul Guitarist Les Paul plays for hometown Les Paul plays for hometown By EMILY FREDRIX, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 11:52 PM ET WAUKESHA, Wis. - Guitar legend Les Paul enthralled a hometown crowd Thursday night at a concert that raised more than $100,000 for an exhibit on his life. The 91-year-old Grammy winner hadn't played in Waukesha in decades. Even though he claimed earlier he's never nervous before going on stage, he admitted "I was lying. I'm nervous tonight." Wearing a blue turtleneck and black slacks, Paul dazzled the crowd with his playing and with stories from his long career. During his hour and a half concert, he joined his jazz trio in playing such tunes as "Tennessee Waltz," "Lady Is a Tramp" and "Embraceable You" as the crowd paid rapt attention. After "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," Paul got emotional, telling the crowd it was his mother's favorite song. "You have no idea what it means to be back here," he said. At one point, he jokingly accused his piano player of missing a note but added that he's missed his share, too. "All the time I've been playing the guitar, the notes I missed, I say I'm saving them for the next album," he cracked. Paul said at an earlier news conference that his trip was stirring up memories, including the motivation to invent the solid-body electric guitar in the 1940s. He recalled coming home from a gig after an audience member told him his guitar needed to be louder. "I went home and I said to my mother, 'I've got a critic and the critic has something to say. It's up to me to do something about it. So I'll make an electric guitar,'" he said. The invention caught on and helped Paul and his wife at the time, Mary Ford, record a series of hit records in the 1950s. Guitar-maker Gibson began mass-producing the Les Paul model in 1952. Many rock musicians became famous playing on the model. "Thank God the younger generation latched onto it and said 'Look what we got here,'" he said. Tickets for Paul's performance Thursday ranged from $300 to $375. All 350 tickets were sold, with all the money going to the Waukesha County Historical Society & Museum, which is raising money for the Les Paul exhibit. In March, Paul donated $25,000 to the museum. Paul is also known for developing recording techniques such as close miking, multitracking and use of echo and delay. He's credited with introducing the first eight-track tape player in 1950s and building an early model synthesizer. He's often called the "Wizard of Waukesha," though he said he's not sure where it came from. "I didn't create it. I don't care ... but if the shoe fits," he said with a laugh. Paul, who lives in Mahwah, N.J., has donated many artifacts and memorabilia for the planned exhibit, a $3 million project expected to open in 2010. Paul didn't need much warm-up time Thursday. He has played twice every Monday night with his trio at the Iridium Jazz Club in New York since 1996. He said he had one regret about the hometown concert &#151; he wished some of his friends, who have since died, could have been around for it. Still, he was happy to come home. "I think of the wonderful days I had and the people who taught me and who I grew up with," he said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/odd_road_rage Man, 78, arrested in road rage case 78, arrested in road rage case PM ET LISBON, Maine - A 78-year-old man is facing charges in a road rage incident in which he allegedly pointed a gun at another driver. Police arrested Daniel Davis at gunpoint after he allegedly pointed a handgun at a woman who had passed his car. The Hallowell man faces weapons charges as well as a charge of operating under the influence, police Chief David Brooks said. A 34-year-old woman from Sabattus told police she was driving south on state Route 125 and had passed Davis, who was driving slowly, Brooks said. Moments later, she noticed that Davis was tailgating before he pulled alongside, pointed a gun at her and then passed her Wednesday night, the chief said. Police credited the woman for calling police on a cell phone and following Davis until he was arrested by police. Davis was released Thursday on $540 bail after being held overnight at the Androscoggin County Jail in Auburn.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/kprc/13300917 Rain, Hail Storm Through Houston Hail Storm Through Houston 1 hour, 56 minutes ago Heavy rains flooded streets and fierce lightning lit up the skies over Houston late Thursday, KPRC Local 2 reported. Team Coverage: Wicked Weather Floods Streets, Homes Flooded Intersection Strands Hundreds Of Vehicles Up to 9 inches of rain fell in about four hours, causing major traffic trouble in parts of north and northwest Houston when the storms rolled through. Hundreds of vehicles were stranded along the Sam Houston Tollway feeder road at Hammerly Boulevard as water covered the intersection and hail pounded down. Several vehicles on the main lanes pulled over to the shoulder and waited until the hail slowed down. The wicked weather caused the roof of Wetmore and Co. on the Sam Houston Tollway at Hammerly Boulevard to cave in, injuring one of the employees inside. Drivers rushed to get out of high water along the North Freeway frontage road at West Mount Houston Road. "It came pretty fast," one motorist said. "We had to stop. We couldn&#39;t get any further." Rescue crews were not immune from the treacherous conditions. An ambulance stalled in high water along Studemont Street near the Katy Freeway. Most of the water drained off in time for Friday morning&#39;s commute. Friday could see a repeat of strong storms. "We&#39;re going to have a beautiful morning and early afternoon, but as we move toward about the same time yesterday, 6:00 or 7:00 p.m., we could see another round of storms rumble on through," KPRC Local 2 meteorologist Anthony Yanez said. Water Creeps Into Houses Rising water made its way into some northwest Houston homes. Theresa Mikelait&#39;s house on Blankenship Drive near Bingle Road was filled with several inches of water. "It started to rain and it just kept raining," Mikelait said. "Then it started hailing and then water started coming in." The speed of the rain and rushing water destroyed Mikelait&#39;s garage door and made it impossible for her to tell where her yard ended and the street began. Mikelait, who has rented the home for about a year and a half, said the flooding was not the first trouble she has had in the home. A CenterPoint Energy truck crashed into her living room in November, nearly hitting her granddaughter in her crib. "This house is cursed or something," Mikelait said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/worldbank_wolfowitz_dc U.S. warns that "world is watching" Wolfowitz saga warns that "world is watching" Wolfowitz saga Thu May 10, 6:54 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States warned on Thursday that "the whole world is watching" to see that embattled President Paul Wolfowitz is treated fairly as critics press him to quit over a pay-and-promotion dispute. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, in a measured response stressing the importance of preserving the global lender&#39;s standing, told a questioner Wolfowitz deserved fair process as the bank board prepares to consider his fate. Some European members want Wolfowitz&#39;s resignation over a controversial pay and promotion deal he approved in 2005 for his companion, bank Middle East expert Shaha Riza, but the Bush administration has stood by the former Paulson said on Bloomberg television that he considered Wolfowitz "a dedicated and committed public servant" who had done valuable work at the World Bank. Wolfowitz has been given until Friday to respond to a bank panel report that found his actions in the pay and promotion deal broke rules. "It&#39;s got to be fair," Paulson said. "A bank with the stature of the World Bank (and) I have the highest regard for the World Bank, the processes they use here are going to be very important, the whole world is watching." Originally, the bank&#39;s 24-nation board had planned to meet on Friday to decide on Wolfowitz&#39;s future, but that was delayed until Tuesday, May 15, after Wolfowitz was granted two extra days to present his response to the investigatory panel. Paulson is a governor of the World Bank and has taken a relatively restrained role in the raging debate over Wolfowitz&#39;s leadership. Each of the bank&#39;s 185 member countries appoints a governor, generally either a finance or a development minister, who helps guide the bank&#39;s operations. European government representatives went to Treasury during an April meeting of the and World Bank to press their case to Paulson that Wolfowitz should quit. The U.S. Treasury chief stressed his view that, whatever happens, there must be no question it is handled properly. "We need very fair processes. This shouldn&#39;t be rushed. But I&#39;m not going to get into outcomes and you shouldn&#39;t take that as any lessening of my support or admiration for Paul Wolfowitz," Paulson said. There was also a call from the State Department on Thursday to let the matter run its course. A department official said Secretary of State had been quietly discussing the issue with European counterparts but he indicated she had basically repeated the White House&#39;s line that it still felt Wolfowitz could be an effective bank leader. "She mentioned this in the normal course of a few conversations with her counterparts, her personal regard for Paul in the job he is doing at the World Bank," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told Reuters. "But we have also made it clear that World Bank processes are going to be worked through," he added. Rice&#39;s access to European capitals provides an opportunity for the Bush administration to gauge how serious the opposition is to Wolfowitz&#39;s continued leadership. The bank&#39;s board is divided in its attitude toward Wolfowitz&#39;s leadership -- European countries are pushing for him to step down and the United States is shoring up support for the former U.S. deputy defense secretary among a clutch of allies like Canada and a few Asian and African countries. He has been a lightning rod for European critics since the White House nominated him in 2005 for the top World Bank post, partly because of his neoconservative past that includes a role as one of the architects of the Iraqi war while he was deputy defense secretary.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/usa_prosecutors_dc Witness granted immunity in prosecutors probe granted immunity in prosecutors probe PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former aide to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales received immunity from prosecution on Friday to testify in a congressional probe into the firing last year of federal prosecutors. Lawyers for Monica Goodling, who had served as the Justice Department&#39;s liaison to the White House, said she would appear before the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. "Monica Goodling is a critical witness," said Committee Chairman John Conyers ( ), a Michigan Democrat. "We look forward to hearing her testimony as promptly as possible." A hearing date was not immediately set. Gonzales has told Congress that the firing of eight of the 93 U.S. attorneys last year was justified, but mishandled. He has rejected claims that some may have been ousted to influence politically charged investigations. Goodling resigned earlier this year after Congress began looking into dismissals, and invoked her right against self-incrimination in refusing to testify. The Judiciary Committee voted last month to seek immunity for Goodling, and the chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia signed an order granting it. Under the order, prosecutors would be barred from using Goodling&#39;s testimony to bring a case against her unless she is untruthful.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/india_wedding_chains Indian man chains son for marrying man chains son for marrying PM ET CALCUTTA, India - A father chained and locked up his 19-year-old son for three weeks for marrying against the family's wishes in eastern India, a police officer said Friday. Police rescued Raghu Amin Mollah from his father's house Thursday on the outskirts of Calcutta, the capital of West Bengal state, said Joy Biswas, a police officer who took part in the operation. "Yes, he was kept in a room locked and chained," Biswas told father, Abed Ali Mollah, has been arrested and charged with illegally detaining and torturing his son for 21 days, he said. Biswas said Abed Ali Mollah opposed his son's marriage to Shahnaz Khatun, 18, because of enmity between the two families. Police acted after Khatun filed a complaint against her father-in-law, Biswas said. The Hindustan Times said the two teenagers had grown up in the same neighborhood and fallen in love. They eloped and wed in a mosque on the outskirts of Calcutta, Biswas said. In rural India, most marriages are arranged by the parents, and it is unusual for young people to choose their own partners.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/ambassador_swift_boat Ex-ambassadors seek removal of appointee seek removal of appointee By SAM HANANEL, Associated Press Writer PM ET WASHINGTON - A group of former U.S. ambassadors asked to remove the U.S. ambassador to Belgium on grounds the recess appointment of Republican donor Sam Fox undermines diplomatic posts worldwide. The White House was forced to withdraw Fox's nomination in March after Senate Democrats indicated they would block it. A week later, Bush appointed Fox, a Missouri businessman, while Congress was in recess. "Appointing an ambassador after the nomination has been withdrawn, and before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Senate Foreign Relations Committee has even considered the nominee, essentially renders the Senate's confirmation process irrelevant," seven former diplomats wrote in a letter to Bush dated May 8. "This has the potential to undermine the legitimacy of those who serve in these vital posts all around the world," the letter said. White House spokesman Alex Conant said Friday he could not immediately confirm receipt of the letter. Conant said Fox "is well qualified and doing a good job representing the president in Belgium." Democrats have denounced Fox for his donation to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth during the 2004 presidential campaign. The group's TV ads, which claimed that Sen. exaggerated his military record in Vietnam, were viewed as a factor in the Massachusetts Democrat's election loss. Most of the former diplomats complaining about Fox served under Democratic presidents. The group includes Dan Spiegel, former ambassador to the in the Clinton administration; Edward Brynn, former ambassador to Mauritania and Gambia under President Reagan; and Edward Peck, former ambassador to The former ambassadors say this is the first time an ambassador has been appointed during a recess after being withdrawn since at least 1981, according to Congressional Research Service records. Three Democratic senators have already asked the , Congress' auditing agency, to investigate whether Bush acted illegally in making the recess appointment. Because his initial appointment was withdrawn, Fox cannot draw a government salary and is working for free. Democrats have asked the GAO whether that arrangement is legally permissible.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/white_alligator Knoxville Zoo displays albino alligator Zoo displays albino alligator By ELIZABETH A. DAVIS, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 3 minutes ago KNOXVILLE, Tenn. - This white alligator has it made in the shade. Without an alligator's normal dark camouflaging color, the new inhabitant at the Knoxville Zoo would not live long while exposed to predators or the sun. In an exhibit made to look like the Louisiana bayou with tree stumps and hanging moss, the 12-year-old American alligator spent one recent afternoon basking under a heat lamp beside a warm pool with one claw lazily dipped in the water. If outside, her skin would burn in the sun. An albino gene makes the alligator's skin white and her eyes pinkish, and the rare find creates a popular exhibit at zoos around the country. The exhibit in Knoxville &#151; marketed with the slogan "Look in Dem Eyes" in reference to a legend that good luck will follow those who see the animal &#151; will last through Labor Day. Zoo visitors paused in a dark lobby and peered through the glass window at her. Occasionally, one eyelid would open and reveal an inner membrane that makes the eye look milky, but otherwise the alabaster-tinted body was still. "Is she real?" is the most common question from visitors, says Phil Colclough, assistant curator of herpetology at the zoo. "Nobody believes she's real. They stare until she takes a breath or moves her eyes or jumps in the pool." Other zoos and tourist attractions have white alligators in the United States, totaling around 50. Some white alligators are albino, meaning they lack a dark pigment called melanin, and their eyes appear reddish because of the blood vessels underneath. Another kind of white alligators are leucistic, meaning they have white pigment and blue eyes. The Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans has leucistic alligators found in a Louisiana swamp in 1987. Three leucistic gators were found in 2003 on Hilton Head Island, S.C., and later seized by state officials, who also arrested the men who discovered them. Knoxville's alligator is on loan from the Alligator Farm Zoological Park in St. Augustine, Fla., which has about 30 animals that have been acquired over the last 15 years from a commercial farmer in Cut Off, La. The albinos are found in the same nest every year and are believed to be produced from the same male and female who both carry the recessive gene for albinism, said David Kledzik, curator of reptiles in St. Augustine. The Florida park made a deal with the farmer to get the albinos. He hatches and raises them until he is ready to give them up, he said. "Every few years we get a call, 'Come get your albinos.' We go out there and get the albinos. We may get six or eight a trip," Kledzik said. The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio also has an albino on exhibit from the Florida zoo. The Knoxville Zoo exhibited a different albino alligator named Lily in 1997. The current alligator's name was decided by a contest and will be announced Monday. "The public likes them a whole lot," Colclough said. "I've been here 12 years, and hardly a week goes by that someone doesn't ask where the white alligator is that was here 10 years ago."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/thin_fat_people DIET: Thin people may be fat inside Thin people may be fat inside By MARIA CHENG, AP Medical Writer 1 hour, 50 minutes ago LONDON - If it really is what's on the inside that counts, then a lot of thin people might be in trouble. Some doctors now think that the internal fat surrounding vital organs like the heart, liver or pancreas &#151; invisible to the naked eye &#151; could be as dangerous as the more obvious external fat that bulges underneath the skin. "Being thin doesn't automatically mean you're not fat," said Dr. Jimmy Bell, a professor of molecular imaging at Imperial College, London. Since 1994, Bell and his team have scanned nearly 800 people with MRI machines to create "fat maps" showing where people store fat. According to the data, people who maintain their weight through diet rather than exercise are likely to have major deposits of internal fat, even if they are otherwise slim. "The whole concept of being fat needs to be redefined," said Bell, whose research is funded by Britain's Medical Research Council. Without a clear warning signal &#151; like a rounder middle &#151; doctors worry that thin people may be lulled into falsely assuming that because they're not overweight, they're healthy. "Just because someone is lean doesn't make them immune to diabetes or other risk factors for heart disease," said Dr. Louis Teichholz, chief of cardiology at Hackensack Hospital in New Jersey, who was not involved in Bell's research. Even people with normal Body Mass Index scores &#151; a standard obesity measure that divides your weight by the square of your height &#151; can have surprising levels of fat deposits inside. Of the women scanned by Bell and his colleagues, as many as 45 percent of those with normal BMI scores (20 to 25) actually had excessive levels of internal fat. Among men, the percentage was nearly 60 percent. Relating the news to what Bell calls "TOFIs" &#151; people who are "thin outside, fat inside" &#151; is rarely uneventful. "The thinner people are, the bigger the surprise," he said, adding the researchers even found TOFIs among people who are professional models. According to Bell, people who are fat on the inside are essentially on the threshold of being obese. They eat too many fatty, sugary foods &#151; and exercise too little to work it off &#151; but they are not eating enough to actually be fat. Scientists believe we naturally accumulate fat around the belly first, but at some point, the body may start storing it elsewhere. Still, most experts believe that being of normal weight is an indicator of good health, and that BMI is a reliable measurement. "BMI won't give you the exact indication of where fat is, but it's a useful clinical tool," said Dr. Toni Steer, a nutritionist at Britain's Medical Research Council. Doctors are unsure about the exact dangers of internal fat, but some suspect it contributes to the risk of heart disease and diabetes. They theorize that internal fat disrupts the body's communication systems. The fat enveloping internal organs might be sending the body mistaken chemical signals to store fat inside organs like the liver or pancreas. This could ultimately lead to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, or heart disease. Experts have long known that fat, active people can be healthier than their skinny, inactive counterparts. "Normal-weight persons who are sedentary and unfit are at much higher risk for mortality than obese persons who are active and fit," said Dr. Steven Blair, an obesity expert at the University of South Carolina. For example, despite their ripples of fat, super-sized Sumo wrestlers probably have a better metabolic profile than some of their slim, sedentary spectators, Bell said. That's because the wrestlers' fat is primarily stored under the skin, not streaking throughout their vital organs and muscles. The good news is that internal fat can be easily burned off through exercise or even by improving your diet. "Even if you don't see it on your bathroom scale, caloric restriction and physical exercise have an aggressive effect on visceral fat," said Dr. Bob Ross, an obesity expert at Queen's University in Canada. Because many factors contribute to heart disease, Teichholz says it's difficult to determine the precise danger of internal fat &#151; though it certainly doesn't help. "Obesity is a risk factor, but it's lower down on the totem pole of risk factors," he said, explaining that whether or not people smoke, their family histories and blood pressure and cholesterol rates are more important determinants than both external and internal fat. When it comes to being fit, experts say there is no short-cut. "If you just want to look thin, then maybe dieting is enough," Bell said. "But if you want to actually be healthy, then exercise has to be an important component of your lifestyle."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/vets_mental_health Suicide risk said higher for veterans risk said higher for veterans By HOPE YEN, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 8:08 PM ET WASHINGTON - Veterans returning from are at increased risk of suicide because not all Veterans Affairs health clinics have 24-hour mental care available, an internal review says. The report released Thursday by the department's inspector general is the first comprehensive look at VA mental health care, particularly suicide prevention. It found that nearly three years into the VA's broad strategy for mental health care, services were inconsistent throughout the agency's 1,400 clinics. Several facilities lacked 24-hour staff, adequate screening for mental problems or properly trained workers. With about one-third of veterans reporting symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, it is "incumbent upon VHA (the Veterans Health Administration) to continue moving forward toward full deployment of suicide prevention strategies for our nation's veterans," the report stated. In a written response, the VA's acting undersecretary for health agreed with many of the recommendations. Michael Kussman noted that the VA recently has placed suicide prevention coordinators in each medical center. The report comes as already-strained troops and veterans say they are suffering more psychological problems due to repeated and extended deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. In a study this month, a task force issued an urgent warning for improved care. In the inspector general report, investigators echoed some of those concerns in calling for additional staffing and better training in VA facilities. It said about 1,000 veterans who receive VA care commit suicide every year and as many as 5,000 a year among all living veterans. The report, which was requested last year by Rep. Michael Michaud ( ), D-Maine, said clinics should work harder so veterans can seek treatment with feeling stigmatized. It recommended additional screening for patients with traumatic brain injury. Among the other recommendations: _VA clinics and Pentagon military hospitals must better share health information, particularly for patients who might return to active-duty status. _The department should ease criteria for inpatient post-traumatic stress disorder. Currently only veterans with "sustained sobriety" get treatment; this bars help for many who report increased drug and alcohol dependency as ways to alleviate stress. _The VA should create a database to help track patients at risk for suicide. The report follows high-profile suicide incidents in which families of veterans say the VA did not do enough to provide care. In one case, the family of Marine Jonathan Schulze said he told staff at a VA Medical Center in Minnesota twice that he was suicidal in the days before he hanged himself Jan. 16, but that he was turned away. The VA has said that was not the case. Paul Rieckhoff, executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said he hoped the VA would place a high priority on suicide prevention given the thousands of veterans suffering from psychological wounds. "We can not afford to nickel and dime our nations heroes," he said. "If we do, we'll be paying for it for a generation." Sen. Patty Murray ( ), a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, said the report pointed to a lack of planning by the department. "It is far past time for the administration to get its act together and treat invisible wounds with the same vigilance that is given to physical injuries," said Murray, D-Wash. Hawaii Sen. Daniel Akaka ( ), who chairs the Senate commitee, said the review showed a greater need for accountability in VA care. "I will continue oversight and work to ensure that VAs mental health professionals have the resources they need," he said.

Even though that would mark a slowdown from the annual 24 percent growth registered in 2002-2006, the market would still double by the end of the decade, the Global Wind Energy Council said. "Despite the strong growth we have witnessed in the past, we estimate that the biggest developments are still ahead," GWEC director Angelika Pullen said in a statement. "Until the end of the current decade, the cumulative capacity of wind energy installations is predicted to reach 149.5 gigawatts, more than double the installed capacity at the end of 2006," she added. Last year, 23 billion dollars (18 billion euros) worth of new wind generators came on line worldwide, lifting total capacity by 25 percent to more than 74 gigawatts. The wind power sector is in the midst of a major boom as countries try to reduce their dependence on increasingly expensive fossil fuels while cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions to fight global climate warming. "If decision makers around the world are genuinely committed to making a difference now, they have to rethink their energy policy and make the deployment of renewable energy technologies, such as wind energy, their number one priority," said GWEC&#39;s secretary general Steve Sawyer. is currently the main market for wind power, demand in both Asia and North America is expanding at "a tremendous pace", the association said. While the US market is expected to become the biggest worldwide by 2010, "the Asian market has exceeded all previous estimations thanks to unexpectedly strong growth in China." The GWEC claims to represent over 1,500 companies, organisations and institutions in more than sixty countries, including all major wind turbine makers.

GHATTAS, Associated Press Writer PM ET BEIRUT, Lebanon - The head of Lebanon's influential Maronite Catholic Church stepped in on Friday to try to head off what could be the next crisis to strike this conflict-torn country &#151; the increasing likelihood that divided lawmakers will be unable to elect a president. Lebanon's parliament has not met for three months because of the divisions between supporters of the Western-backed government and the opposition, led by It is parliament's role to choose a new president before the term of Syrian ally Emile Lahoud runs out Nov. 23. But the deadlock and bitterness between the two camps makes it doubtful a compromise candidate can be found. Failure to pick a head of state could leave the post empty and could even lead to the creation of two competing governments. In 1988, when Lebanon was in similar straits, the army and administration split in a dispute that ended in one of the last battles of the 1975-1990 civil war. The current political crisis has taken a sectarian tone and erupted into street battles earlier this year which killed 11 people. Alarmed by the possibility of a presidential crisis, Maronite Cardinal Nasrallah Sfeir ended a boycott of Lahoud, and the two discussed choosing a successor. It was the first encounter in over a year between the spiritual leader of the church and the president. The church has a special interest in the presidency, a post traditionally held by a Maronite under Lebanon's sectarian-based division of political power &#151; making Lebanon the only state in the overwhelmingly Muslim Arab world with a Christian head of state. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Sfeir said he hoped the presidential election will be held "on time and that there will be the person who can take charge." He refused to suggest a candidate but said the choice should be "an experienced person, be of the same distance from all people" and serve the national interest. The anti-Syrian coalition swept into power in 2005 has been trying to oust Lahoud, seen as one of the anchors of Syria's continuing influence in the country. The anti-Syrian bloc, Sfeir and Western countries have refused to meet Lahoud, whose term was extended under Syrian pressure in 2004, months before the Syrian army was forced to withdraw from Lebanon after the assassination of former Premier Rafik Hariri. Now with Lahoud unable to run for another term, the anti-Syrians &#151; who hold a slim majority in parliament &#151; see their chance to elect one of their own to the post. But the Hezbollah-led opposition has vowed to reject any candidate they don't approve of. The anti-Syrian bloc has threatened to use its simple majority to pass a candidate, but the opposition insists a two-thirds quorum &#151; as has been the practice in previous presidential elections, even during civil war &#151; is necessary and threatens to boycott any vote. Already, the opposition is trying to oust the government of Prime Minister Fuad Saniora, which Lahoud does not recognize. Saniora has resisted, but has been unable to govern effectively because the speaker of parliament &#151; an ally of Syria and Lahoud &#151; has refused to convene the legislature. The dispute has split Lebanon along sectarian lines, with Sunni Muslims backing Saniora, who is Sunni, and Shiites backing the opposition. Christians are divided. If there is no president, the constitution calls on the prime minister and his Cabinet to assume his duties. But some in the opposition are calling on Lahoud &#151; if it appears no successor is agreed on by the time he leaves office &#151; to appoint a Christian to head a new government to ensure that the presidential powers remain in Christian hands. With Saniora refusing to quit, that would precipitate two administrations. A similar crisis erupted in 1988, when two governments were formed. Fighting erupted between the divided factions of the army, and eventually a Syrian assault removed one of the governments. "My message to the people is to remain calm ... I hope things will occur on time, in accordance with the constitution," Sfeir said after the 90-minute meeting with Lahoud. Other religious leaders also hoped to avert a further meltdown. The spiritual leader of Lebanon's Sunni Muslims, Grand Mufti Sheik Mohammed Rashid Kabbani said Friday he will work with the "wise leaders ... to prevent falling into the trap of a second government." He reminded the Lebanese of "the dark stage of conflicts and destruction of Lebanon when there were two governments."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/mandatory_hiv_testing New plan would mandate HIV tests in N.J. plan would mandate HIV tests in N.J. By TOM HESTER Jr., Associated Press Writer Sat May 12, 12:33 AM ET TRENTON, N.J. - New Jersey would become the first state to require both pregnant women and newborns to be tested for under a proposal introduced by the Senate president. The bill would require all pregnant women be tested for HIV twice, once early in the pregnancy and a second time in the third trimester. Every birthing facility in the state would have to test all newborns in their care. Senate President Richard J. Codey introduced the legislation on Thursday, which he described as a "no brainer." The Associated Press first reported on Codey's plan in March. "The key in the fight against HIV and is early detection and treatment," Codey said Friday. "For newborns this can be a lifesaving measure." Codey, D-Essex, said the bill stems from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that found medical treatment during pregnancy can dramatically cut mother-to-child HIV transmission. The Center for Women Policy Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based feminist advocacy organization, opposes mandatory HIV testing, arguing it violates a woman's right to make their own childbearing and medical treatment decisions. Current New Jersey law requires providers only to offer HIV testing to pregnant women. Under Codey's proposal, the test would be given unless the mother chooses, in writing, not to have it. According to the Kaiser Foundation, a nonprofit research organization focusing on U.S. health care issues, four states &#151; Arkansas, Michigan, Tennessee and Texas &#151; require health care providers to test a mother for HIV, unless the mother specifically asks not to be tested. Connecticut and New York are the only states that test all newborns for HIV, according to the foundation. New Jersey has some of the highest rates in the nation for AIDS cases, women with AIDS and pediatric HIV and AIDS cases, according to the foundation. Codey's bill will be scheduled for hearings in the coming weeks. To become law, it must be approved by both the state Senate and Assembly, and then signed by the governor.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/lung_cancer_dc Lung cancer tied to family risk of other cancers cancer tied to family risk of other cancers PM ET NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - People who have a first-degree relative with early-onset lung cancer are themselves at heightened risk for developing other types of cancer, according to a new report. The types of cancers involved differ between Caucasians and African-Americans, the researchers found. Dr. Michele L. Coté, from Wayne State University in Detroit, and associates previously reported evidence of a clustering of lung cancer in families. For their current report, in the medical journal Chest, they examined risk for other cancers among family members of people who developed early-onset lung cancer. Their study included 673 subjects with lung cancer diagnosed before age 50, as well as 3556 parents and siblings. A randomly selected comparison group of 773 subjects, with information for 3,943 first-degree relatives, served as "controls." Approximately one third of the study population was African-American. Overall, relatives of the lung cancer case were at almost double the risk for lung cancer compared with "control" relatives. Female relatives also had twice the risk for endometrial cancer. When analyzed by race, white but not black relatives of people with lung cancer were at heightened risk for endometrial cancer and for any female reproductive malignancy. In contrast, African-American relatives of lung cancer cases were at significantly higher risk for head and neck cancers, lung cancer, and tobacco-related cancer. The team found that African-Americans had roughly double the risk of these three cancers compared with the white subjects. The researchers suggest that the familial clustering for different types of cancer and the variation between races may reflect inherited susceptibility. "Ideally," they add, "knowledge that a family history of early-onset lung cancer may be a risk factor for both tobacco-related and other types of cancers may encourage individuals to adopt healthier behaviors, including smoking cessation and appropriate screening."

"This morning at 4:44 A.M. in , a coalition force team of eight soldiers -- seven Americans and an Iraqi army interpreter -- were attacked 12 miles (20 kilometres) west of Mahmudiyah," said spokesman Major General William Caldwell. "As a result of this attack, five soldiers were killed in action and three are currently missing," he said, without clarifying whether the dead were all US soldiers or whether the Iraqi interpreter was among those killed. "At the time of the attack, a nearby unit heard explosions and attempted to establish communications, but without success," he said, in a statement. "Coalition Forces arrived within an hour, secured the site, and immediately initiated a search. The names of the Soldiers are being withheld pending final identification and notification of next of kin," he said. "Make no mistake -- we will never stop looking for our soldiers until their status is definitively determined, and we continue to pray for their safe return," he added. Mahmudiyah lies 30 kilometres (20 miles) south of Baghdad in an area known for a strong insurgent presence and nicknamed the "triangle of death". Earlier, US marines patroling a road west of Baghdad near the restive city of Fallujah, told an AFP reporter travelling with them that they had been told the missing soldiers might be being brought their way.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/iraq1_dc Bombers kill 26 in attacks on Iraqi bridges kill 26 in attacks on Iraqi bridges By Ibon Villelabeitia and Dean Yates PM ET BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Truck bombs exploded on three important bridges near Baghdad on Friday, killing 26 people and damaging two of the spans in an apparent attempt by insurgents to paralyze road links to the Iraqi capital. The attacks defy efforts by the U.S. military to smash car bomb cells and are the latest in a series of attacks on infrastructure around Baghdad, where U.S. and Iraqi forces have deployed thousands more troops under a three-month-old security plan. In England, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani said would need U.S. and British troops for another year or two. "I think in one or two years we will be able to recruit our own army forces and say goodbye to our friends," the president told students in a lecture at Cambridge University. Police said suicide truck bombers struck police checkpoints on two bridges in a Shi&#39;ite area south of Baghdad, killing 22 people and badly damaging one bridge. They said 60 people were wounded. An Iraqi army source said a truck bomb also hit a bridge near the town of Taji just north of Baghdad on the main highway connecting the capital with cities in the north. He said it was quickly followed by a car bomb that killed four soldiers there. The U.S. military said the bridge was impassable for northbound traffic. Last month, a truck bomb destroyed the Sarafiya Bridge in Baghdad. Days later a suicide car bomber blew himself up on a ramp leading to another bridge in the capital, which is bisected by the River Tigris. Politicians from both sides of the Shi&#39;ite-Sunni sectarian divide have accused insurgents of trying to split the capital of seven million people along sectarian lines. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has said his security forces will be ready to take control of the country by the end of this year, but Friday&#39;s attacks illustrate the challenges ahead in trying to drag Iraq back from the brink of sectarian civil war. A police source said eight policemen were among the dead in the attacks on the bridges south of Baghdad, but it was unclear how many casualties were caused by each blast. Police said the first bomber damaged the old Diyala Bridge. Minutes later, a few kilometers (miles) away, another attacker detonated a truck bomb on the new Diyala Bridge. The two bridges over the Diyala River, a tributary of the Tigris, are commonly used by Shi&#39;ite pilgrims on their way to holy Shi&#39;ite cities to the south. In Washington, debate over funding the war moved to the Senate after Democrats in the House of Representatives defied President George W. Bush President George W. Bush on Thursday by passing a bill that allows money to continue combat only for two or three months. Bush vetoed a &#36;124 billion war funding bill last week because it set a deadline for the withdrawal of combat troops. Senators appear more willing to give Bush the &#36;100 billion he wants at once, but it remains unclear how far they might go in setting binding "benchmarks" to measure progress in Iraq. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( ), Democrat of Nevada, said on Friday there was "new reason to believe that a bipartisan consensus on Iraq is emerging." Bush said he would back benchmarks but he and congressional Republicans do not want to spell out actions the United States would take if Iraqi progress in securing the country falls short. U.S. Democrats and some Republicans say Iraq&#39;s Shi&#39;ite government must reach out to minority Sunni Arabs and reduce sectarian violence if it wants U.S. forces to stay. Officials of Iraq&#39;s most powerful Shi&#39;ite party said on Friday it would make key changes to its platform, in a move that will increasingly align it with Iraq&#39;s top Shi&#39;ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. The changes could also distance the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) from neighboring Shi&#39;ite , where the party was formed in the 1980s to oppose the late President Underscoring the strain on U.S. forces as the Baghdad buildup nears its peak, one commander said he needed more troops in volatile Diyala province north of the city. "I do not have enough soldiers right now in Diyala province to get that security situation moving," said Army Maj. Gen. Benjamin Mixon, commander of forces in areas north of Baghdad.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/american_idol_finalists 'Idol' finalists awash in hometown love finalists awash in hometown love By JOHN GEROME, Associated Press Writer PM ET NASHVILLE, Tenn. - The three remaining `American Idol' contestants took to the streets Friday &#151; of their rapturous hometowns. Local loyalists showed all day just who they thought should win Fox's wildly popular singing contest, which will feature some of the scenes next week. Back before she was an "American Idol" finalist, Melinda Doolittle was a Belmont University mascot. She wore a hot, sweaty bear costume and jumped around in the name of school spirit. The tables were turned on Doolittle in a big way when she returned Friday to her alma mater. Hundreds waved signs and shouted encouragement to her: "We love you, Melinda." "You're going to win, Melinda." "Doolittle's Da Bomb." "Melinda for President." The school even named a street after her, unveiling a black iron post with a blue sign that read: "Melinda Doolittle Way." Doolittle, who arrived waving from the back of a white convertible Mustang, looked &#151; all too characteristically, as "Idol" judge Simon Cowell has scolded her &#151; surprised and overwhelmed. "If I talk too much I'll cry," she said. "You have no idea how much this means to me. ... This is probably one of the most amazing things I've ever experienced." Doolittle said she was glad to be home, even if just for an afternoon. "I just got some sweet tea, so I'm happy. Now I need some candied yams and greens and I'll be great." Doolittle, a professional backup singer in Nashville before she became an "Idol" contestant, has a rich, powerful voice that she put to work on two songs Friday. But even stars have off moments, and Doolittle's came during her first number when her microphone kept cutting off. The problem was corrected, and she recovered nicely for the second song. Ironically, her mother, Marguerite Doolittle, said her daughter was tone deaf until about the sixth grade. She couldn't carry a tune to save her life. "God really dropped a voice into her in the seventh grade," her mother said. "It's been so exciting watching this, because it was not there before. It's like seeing a miracle, really." Doolittle, 29, graduated from Belmont with a music degree in 1999. Everyone in the crowd was certain she'd prevail over rivals Jordin Sparks and Blake Lewis. "She's very talented, and she's also very sweet and personable," said Susan Belsante of Charlotte, N.C. Belsante has a daughter at Belmont and a son graduating from nearby Vanderbilt University. She felt a little guilty about it, but she skipped the commencement speech at her son's graduation so she could come cheer Doolittle. "I went `Let's see,'" she said, holding up both hands like a scale, "commencement speech or Melinda Doolittle.' "I had to go with Melinda Doolittle." The scene was just as raucous in Seattle, where Lewis, 25, played a free concert before more than a thousand fans at Westlake Park. He was joined onstage by Seattle's own Sir Mix-A-Lot, who sang his hit "Baby Got Back" over what many in the crowd came to see: Lewis' beat-boxing. "Every time you watch `American Idol,' you see people that can sing, and that's it," Mix-A-Lot said to wild applause. "This cat got real talent. ... He's the new king of Sea-town, baby." Lewis' homecoming plans included a parade in his suburban hometown of Bothell and a performance of the national anthem at the Mariners-Yankees game Friday night. He looked out on the crowd in the warm midday sunshine and said: "I'm speechless. Thank you guys for all the support." Many in the crowd, populated largely by truant teenage girls, screamed and waved signs that read "Blaker Girls" or "We (heart) Blake." Blaire Ginnever, a 14-year-old eighth-grader, said she was skipping her lunch period and Spanish class at Villa Academy in Seattle. "Blake es muy bueno," she said. Ginnever's mom, Marilyn, was also in the crowd, and said she didn't mind that her daughter was missing school. "It's the end of the year, and this is big for Seattle," she said. "We follow the show. It's kind of a family event, and rooting for a hometown boy makes it special." City Councilwoman Jean Godden, who is old enough to remember a significant chunk of Seattle's musical history, read a proclamation declaring Friday "Blake Lewis Day" and placing the "renowned beat-box musician" in a local tradition that includes Jimi Hendrix, , Nirvana, Modest Mouse and Death Cab for Cutie. Meanwhile, in Glendale, Ariz., an estimated 5,000 fans weathered 100-degree heat to see the 17-year-old Sparks, their hometown fave. A stage was erected in an outdoor plaza at Westgate City Center and some fans waited up to five hours to see her. "You guys are crazy but I love you for it," Sparks told the crowd before singing three songs that she has performed on the show &#151; "Give Me One Reason," "Heartbreaker" and "I Who Have Nothing." "I hope I make you proud next Tuesday," Sparks told the crowd, referring to the upcoming semifinals. The last singer standing will be announced May 23. Glendale, located just northwest of Phoenix, has been throwing elaborate, outdoor "Idol" viewing parties to show support for Sparks. Since March 20, the city of about 245,000 has seen hundreds of people from all over the state turn out to see "Idol" episodes on two 14-foot TVs. The city also has distributed hundreds of free "Glendale supports Jordin" posters at its visitor center. Sparks made a grand entrance late Friday afternoon, perched on the back of pink Mustang convertible. Her father &#151; former Arizona State and NFL player Phillippi Sparks &#151; and other family members followed behind in two other convertibles. Once on stage, Glendale Mayor Elaine Scruggs presented Sparks and her family with a special city proclamation. Associated Press Writer Gene Johnson in Seattle and Terry Tang in Glendale, Ariz., contributed to this report.

The attack took place near the town of Mahmudiya, a rural area south of the capital that is a stronghold of al Qaeda militants. "This morning at 4:44 a.m. (0044 GMT) in , a coalition force team of eight soldiers (seven Americans and an Iraqi army interpreter), were attacked 12 miles west of Mahmudiya. As a result of this attack, five soldiers were killed in action and three are currently missing," a U.S. military statement said. U.S. spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Christopher Garver said it was not immediately clear if the Iraqi army translator was among the dead or missing. "Coalition forces are currently using every means at our disposal to find the missing Soldiers, and we will continue these efforts until all are accounted for," the statement quoted Major-General William Caldwell, chief military spokesman for U.S. forces in Iraq, as saying. Caldwell said a rapid-reaction force was dispatched to the area one hour after hearing an explosion. "The quick reaction force reported finding five members of the team killed in action and three others whose duty status and whereabouts are unknown," Caldwell said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/bullock_stalker_dc Bullock gets order against female stalker gets order against female stalker PM ET LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Actress on Friday won a three-year restraining order against a woman she said had tossed animal fur over her gate, left woven palm fronds in her yard and tried to run down her husband. The "Miss Congeniality" star told a court in the Orange County city of Westminster that the woman, identified as Marcia Diana Valentine, had left the fronds, complete with "weird signs," and "pieces of animal fur" in her yard on five occasions. Valentine, 45, from nearby Huntington Beach, was arrested last month on charges of trying to run down Bullock&#39;s motorcycle mogul husband, Jesse James, in front of the couple&#39;s house. She has also been found on several occasions lying in front of the couple&#39;s garage door, yelling obscenities at James, Bullock&#39;s lawyer said. Valentine told police after her April arrest that she had seen all of Bullock&#39;s movies. She is free on &#36;25,000 bail pending a court hearing. The restraining order bars Valentine from coming within 500 yards of Bullock, James or his three children for three years. Bullock, 42, star of "Two Weeks Notice" and "28 Days," married James in July 2005. James, who builds custom motorcycles and is the producer of the television series "Monster Garage," has three children from a previous marriage.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/usiraqoil Iraq said to be missing up to 15 million dollars of oil daily said to be missing up to 15 million dollars of oil daily Sat May 12, 4:56 AM ET WASHINGTON (AFP) - Between five million and 15 million dollars worth of oil a day is accounted for in and could have been siphoned off through corruption or smuggling, The New York Times reoported Saturday. Citing a draft US government report it gained access to, the newspaper said the amounts relate to between 100,000 and 300,000 barrels a day of IraqÃ‚Â’s declared oil production over the past four years. The report does not give a final conclusion on what happened to the missing fraction of the roughly two million barrels pumped by Iraq each day, the paper said. But the findings are sure to reinforce longstanding suspicions that smugglers, insurgents and corrupt officials control significant parts of the countryÃ‚Â’s oil industry, The Times said. The report also covered alternative explanations for the billions of dollars worth of discrepancies, including the possibility that Iraq has been consistently overstating its oil production. Iraq and the US State Department have been under relentless pressure to show tangible progress in Iraq by raising production levels, which have languished well below the US goal of three million barrels a day, according to the report. The draft report, expected to be released within the next week, was prepared by the United States with the help of government energy analysts, and was provided to The Times by a separate government office that received a review copy.

Mixon also said that Iraqi government officials are not moving fast enough to provide the "most powerful weapon" against insurgents &#151; a government that works and supplies services for the people. Mixon commands the area that includes Diyala province, north of Baghdad. It was a hotbed of the Sunni insurgency before the start of the Baghdad security crackdown and has worsened since militants fled there to avoid the increased U.S.-led operations started in the capital in February. His comments on the Iraqi government were unusually candid and in keeping with the sentiment in Congress and among some administration officials as well as an American electorate becoming ever more impatient with the war. Mixon has already received extra troops, but violence in Diyala is on the rise, he said, both because more militants have moved in and because coalition forces are taking the offensive. "We are sure there are elements of both Sunni extremists and Shia extremists that have moved out of Baghdad and relocated into not only Diyala province, but also into Salah ad Din province," he said. The U.S. is taking increasing casualties in Diyala. One soldier was killed Thursday from an explosion during combat operations in the province; one was killed and four others were wounded Tuesday in a shooting attack; and six U.S. soldiers were killed Sunday when a massive bomb destroyed their vehicle. "I do not have enough soldiers right now in Diyala province to get that security situation moving," Mixon said. "We have plans to put additional forces in that region." He declined to give details but said Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno, the No. 2 commander in Iraq, is planning to send more forces. "I laid out a plan for General Odierno on the numbers of forces that I would need," Mixon told reporters by video conference from Iraq. "We have made progress ... we have taken terrain back from the enemy. General Odierno intends to give me additional forces as they become available." Additional troops have been flowing into Iraq for months as part of 's plan to try to get a handle on violence in the four-year-old war. Initially, Bush ordered an extra 21,500 combat troops to the country &#151; mainly to be used in Baghdad, but also in Anbar province. An additional 7,000 are going in support positions. The last of five extra brigades planned in the increase is to arrive by June. There are some 146,000 U.S. troops in Iraq now. Mixon has about 3,500 troops in Diyala and there are about 10,000 Iraqi soldiers and several thousand Iraqi police, with 3,000 more police approved but not yet hired and trained. this week visited Iraq and pressed the government to make more progress, while Defense Secretary Robert Gates said there last month that "the clock is ticking" on reconciliation and other measures of progress in Iraq. Mixon said Diyala's government is so ineffective at providing services that it could be described as nonfunctioning. He also blamed national ministries in Baghdad and said the weak government hampers coalition efforts to make the country more secure. Showing Iraqis that their government can provide for them "will be the most powerful weapon against this insurgency," Mixon said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/iraq_oil_report_dc U.S. study finds billions of Iraqi oil missing: NYT study finds billions of Iraqi oil missing: NYT Sat May 12, 1:23 AM ET NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billions of dollars&#39; worth of Iraq&#39;s declared oil production over the past four years is unaccounted for, possibly having been siphoned off through corruption or smuggling, The New York Times said on Saturday. Between 100,000 and 300,000 barrels of Iraq&#39;s daily output of roughly 2 million barrels is missing, it said, citing a draft report prepared by the U.S. and government energy analysts which is expected to be released next week. The discrepancy was valued between &#36;5 million and &#36;15 million daily, using a &#36;50 per barrel average, the report said. That adds up to billions of dollars over the four years since the March 2003 U.S.-led invasion of The newspaper was provided the draft report by a separate government office that received a review copy. The GAO declined to discuss the draft, the paper said. The report did not make a final conclusion on what happened to the missing oil, and provided alternative explanations besides corruption or smuggling, including possible Iraqi overstating of its production. A State Department official who works on energy matters offered possible explanations including pipeline sabotage, or inaccurate reporting of oil production in southern Iraq. "It could also be theft," the Times quoted the unnamed official as saying, with suspicion falling on southern Shi&#39;ite militias. "Crude oil is not as lucrative in the region as refined products, but we&#39;re not ruling that out either," the official said. "There is not an issue of insurgency, per se, but it could be funding Shia factions, and that could very well be true." "That would be a concern if they were using smuggling money to blow up American soldiers or kill Sunnis or do anything that could harm the unity of the country," the Times quoted the official as saying. The newspaper characterized the report as the most comprehensive look thus far at what it called faltering U.S. efforts to rebuild Iraq&#39;s oil and electricity sectors. The GAO tapped experts at the Energy Information Administration within the United States for its oil analysis. Erik Kreil, an oil expert at the administration who is familiar with the analysis, said a review of industry figures worldwide indicated Iraq&#39;s stated production figures did not add up. "Either they&#39;re producing less, or they&#39;re producing what they say and the difference is completely unaccounted for in any of the places we think it should go," Kreil told the Times. "Either it&#39;s overly optimistic, or it&#39;s unaccounted for." Analysts outside the government said such a large discrepancy indicated that there was either a major smuggling operation in place or that Iraq was not generating accurate production figures, the newspaper added.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/ambassador_swift_boat Ex-ambassadors seek removal of appointee seek removal of appointee By SAM HANANEL, Associated Press Writer PM ET WASHINGTON - A group of former U.S. ambassadors asked to remove the U.S. ambassador to Belgium on grounds the recess appointment of Republican donor Sam Fox undermines diplomatic posts worldwide. The White House was forced to withdraw Fox's nomination in March after Senate Democrats indicated they would block it. A week later, Bush appointed Fox, a Missouri businessman, while Congress was in recess. "Appointing an ambassador after the nomination has been withdrawn, and before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Senate Foreign Relations Committee has even considered the nominee, essentially renders the Senate's confirmation process irrelevant," seven former diplomats wrote in a letter to Bush dated May 8. "This has the potential to undermine the legitimacy of those who serve in these vital posts all around the world," the letter said. White House spokesman Alex Conant said Friday he could not immediately confirm receipt of the letter. Conant said Fox "is well qualified and doing a good job representing the president in Belgium." Democrats have denounced Fox for his donation to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth during the 2004 presidential campaign. The group's TV ads, which claimed that Sen. exaggerated his military record in Vietnam, were viewed as a factor in the Massachusetts Democrat's election loss. Most of the former diplomats complaining about Fox served under Democratic presidents. The group includes Dan Spiegel, former ambassador to the in the Clinton administration; Edward Brynn, former ambassador to Mauritania and Gambia under President Reagan; and Edward Peck, former ambassador to The former ambassadors say this is the first time an ambassador has been appointed during a recess after being withdrawn since at least 1981, according to Congressional Research Service records. Three Democratic senators have already asked the , Congress' auditing agency, to investigate whether Bush acted illegally in making the recess appointment.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/iraq Iraq attack leaves 5 GIs dead; 3 missing attack leaves 5 GIs dead; 3 missing BAGHDAD - Seven U.S. soldiers and an Iraqi army interpreter came under attack Saturday morning during a patrol of a Sunni insurgent stronghold south of Baghdad, leaving five dead and three missing, the military said. Troops were searching for the three missing, using drone planes, jets and checkpoints throughout the area, according to the statement. Soldiers were also asking local leaders for information. After the pre-dawn attack near Mahmoudiya, a Sunni stronghold about 20 miles south of Baghdad, nearby units heard explosions and a drone plane later observed two burning vehicles, the statement said. Troops who arrived later found five of the soldiers dead. The other three members of the patrol were gone, according to the statement, from Maj. Gen. William Caldwell, the chief U.S. military spokesman in The military refused to specify whether the Iraqi interpreter was among those killed or among the missing, citing security. "Make no mistake: We will never stop looking for our soldiers until their status is definitively determined, and we continue to pray for their safe return," Caldwell said. The attack occurred nearly a year after two American soldiers went missing following a June 16 attack in the same area, prompting a massive search. Their bodies were found tied together with a bomb between one victim's legs several days later.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/white_alligator Knoxville Zoo displays albino alligator Zoo displays albino alligator By ELIZABETH A. DAVIS, Associated Press Writer PM ET KNOXVILLE, Tenn. - This white alligator has it made in the shade. Without an alligator's normal dark camouflaging color, the new inhabitant at the Knoxville Zoo would not live long while exposed to predators or the sun. In an exhibit made to look like the Louisiana bayou with tree stumps and hanging moss, the 12-year-old American alligator spent one recent afternoon basking under a heat lamp beside a warm pool with one claw lazily dipped in the water. If outside, her skin would burn in the sun. An albino gene makes the alligator's skin white and her eyes pinkish, and the rare find creates a popular exhibit at zoos around the country. The exhibit in Knoxville &#151; marketed with the slogan "Look in Dem Eyes" in reference to a legend that good luck will follow those who see the animal &#151; will last through Labor Day. Zoo visitors paused in a dark lobby and peered through the glass window at her. Occasionally, one eyelid would open and reveal an inner membrane that makes the eye look milky, but otherwise the alabaster-tinted body was still. "Is she real?" is the most common question from visitors, says Phil Colclough, assistant curator of herpetology at the zoo. "Nobody believes she's real. They stare until she takes a breath or moves her eyes or jumps in the pool." Other zoos and tourist attractions have white alligators in the United States, totaling around 50. Some white alligators are albino, meaning they lack a dark pigment called melanin, and their eyes appear reddish because of the blood vessels underneath. Another kind of white alligators are leucistic, meaning they have white pigment and blue eyes. The Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans has leucistic alligators found in a Louisiana swamp in 1987. Three leucistic gators were found in 2003 on Hilton Head Island, S.C., and later seized by state officials, who also arrested the men who discovered them. Knoxville's alligator is on loan from the Alligator Farm Zoological Park in St. Augustine, Fla., which has about 30 animals that have been acquired over the last 15 years from a commercial farmer in Cut Off, La. The albinos are found in the same nest every year and are believed to be produced from the same male and female who both carry the recessive gene for albinism, said David Kledzik, curator of reptiles in St. Augustine. The Florida park made a deal with the farmer to get the albinos. He hatches and raises them until he is ready to give them up, he said. "Every few years we get a call, 'Come get your albinos.' We go out there and get the albinos. We may get six or eight a trip," Kledzik said. The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio also has an albino on exhibit from the Florida zoo. The Knoxville Zoo exhibited a different albino alligator named Lily in 1997. The current alligator's name was decided by a contest and will be announced Monday. "The public likes them a whole lot," Colclough said. "I've been here 12 years, and hardly a week goes by that someone doesn't ask where the white alligator is that was here 10 years ago."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/lifestyleskoreaasia International marriages -- and divorces -- surge in SKorea marriages -- and divorces -- surge in SKorea PM ET OSAN, South Korea (AFP) - Despite the unromantic occasion, Ngo Ngoc Quy Hong says it was love at first sight when she and other Vietnamese women held a group meeting with prospective husbands from "I don&#39;t know why but at that moment, I knew I had just found my man," said Hong, 21, beaming at her husband who is 19 years older than her. "Age does not matter. I am very happy now," she said in halting Korean, her gold bracelet glinting as she flipped through an album of their wedding photos taken in Ho Chi Minh City. Her husband Kim Choong-Hwan, a 40-year-old truck driver, has only one regret. "I regret I had no chance to meet a Vietnamese woman earlier. If I had, I would have married a Vietnamese," said Kim, who divorced his first wife, a South Korean, in 2002. "Hong is six months&#39; pregnant. I know it&#39;s a son," he told AFP proudly during an interview at their modest apartment in Osan, 55 km (34 miles) south of Seoul. Kim is among a growing army of South Korean bachelors or divorcees who have turned to China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Mongolia, Thailand, Russia, Uzbekistan and other foreign countries for brides. In a country long known for its homogeneous make-up, government statistics show that the number of marriages to foreigners jumped 21.6 percent to 43,121 in 2005 -- 13.6 percent of all newlyweds. Experts say many farmers who fail to persuade local women to accept a rural lifestyle, and surplus bachelors resulting from the traditional preference for sons over daughters, turn to foreign brides. The National Statistical Office said 72 percent of international marriages involved Korean men and foreign women. Chinese brides topped the list at 66.2 percent, followed by Vietnamese with 18.7 percent, Japanese with four percent and Filipinas with 3.2 percent. But Vietnamese brides are becoming increasingly popular. The number of such weddings jumped by 136.5 percent to 5,822 in 2005 compared to a mere 95 in 2000. "Vietnamese women are quite popular here as they are considered the most tolerant to Korea&#39;s Confucianist, family-oriented culture and they adapt well here," said Lee Eun-Tae, president of Interwedding Co. Hong said she had been a fan of Korean TV dramas aired in Vietnam, part of a wave of Korean pop culture spreading across Asia. Her twin sister married a Korean three months before her. Another sister has also tied the knot with a Korean who travelled to Vietnam alongside Kim to find a bride. Kim said he had chanced on a street sign reading: "Why don&#39;t you marry a beautiful Vietnamese?" He visited a marriage agency in Seoul after he became frustrated with what he called materialistic local women. "Their first questions are only concerned with your social status, occupation, income and the like. They don&#39;t care about character," he said. Kim spent 10,000 dollars for a five-day package tour to Vietnam which included a wedding ceremony and a one-night honeymoon. Decisions on brides are made within a matter of hours through a group get-together. Out of a line-up of 40 girls, Kim and five others made three picks each. The brides and their families have the final say on who should be the lucky ones. They may reject all the men on offer. Most such marriages are arranged by commercial agencies like Interwedding. "Then, you may ask where is romance? But love is something that can come instantly and all the men and women taking part in this programme are prepared to get married very soon," Lee said. But couples like Hong and Kim can be the lucky ones. Lee said some of his competitors failed to do their homework, screening bridegrooms and brides cursorily and introducing couples unfit to marry. A government survey showed one out of every five migrant women found their Korean husbands different from the description they received from the agencies. Activists say some foreign brides end up living with spouses who have few assets or are ill, alcoholic or of difficult character. A 2005 study by the Ministry of Health and Welfare showed that 14 percent of 945 migrant wives surveyed said they had been beaten by their Korean husbands. "Some Korean husbands, unable to get through to their foreign wives because of language barriers, get angry and beat them. They also tend to think they have purchased their wives," said Kwon Mi-Ju of the Women Migrants Human Rights Centre. Activists say foreign brides often face serious problems adapting to a new life in a country with a different culture and atmosphere. As a result, divorces between Korean men and foreign wives are rising fast, reaching 2,400 in 2005 -- up 65 percent from the previous year. "Lured by the country&#39;s economic strength, many foreign women come here harboring illusions about Korea," said Yoo Kyung-Sun, an aide to lawmaker Kim Choon-Jin. Kim has proposed a law bill to curb reckless matchmaking by commercial agencies.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/congressman_bribery New charges against former CIA official charges against former CIA official By ALLISON HOFFMAN, Associated Press Writer Sat May 12, 1:41 AM ET SAN DIEGO - New charges have been filed alleging that a former top official pushed a proposed $100 million government contract for his best friend in return for lavish vacations, private jet flights and a lucrative job offer. The indictment, returned Thursday, replaces charges brought in February against Kyle "Dusty" Foggo, who resigned from the spy agency a year ago, and Poway-based defense contractor Brent Wilkes. The charges grew from the bribery scandal that landed former U.S. Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham in prison. The pair now face 30 wide-ranging counts of fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. According to the new indictment, Foggo provided Wilkes with "sensitive, internal information related to our national security," including classified information, to help him prepare proposals for providing undercover flights for the CIA under the guise of a civil aviation company and armored vehicles for agency operations. Then, he pushed his CIA colleagues to hire Wilkes' companies without disclosing their friendship, prosecutors allege. In a June 2005 e-mail to the head of CIA air operations quoted in the indictment, Foggo offered to "use some 'EXDIR grease'" on Wilkes' behalf. Foggo was the agency's executive director at the time. Prosecutors say that in return, Wilkes offered to hire Foggo after he retired from government service. In the meantime, they say, he treated his friend to a Scottish golf trip during which they racked up a $44,000 hotel bill at the luxurious Pitcastle Estate. The initial indictment in February charged the pair with 11 counts of the same charges in connection with a $1.7 million water-supply contract Foggo allegedly helped win for one of Wilkes' companies while he was working as a logistics coordinator at a CIA supply hub overseas. Both men have pleaded not guilty to those charges. They face arraignment on the new charges Monday. Wilkes is charged in a separate indictment with conspiracy, bribery, money laundering and unlawful monetary transactions to Cunningham in return for government contracts. That indictment also was updated this week to include new charges against another defendant, Long Island mortgage banker John T. Michael, who was described as a co-conspirator in Cunningham's 2005 plea agreement. He has pleaded not guilty to one count of obstructing justice but now faces additional counts of money laundering and unlawful monetary transactions in connection with wire transfers allegedly used to pay off the mortgage on Cunningham's $2.5 million Rancho Santa Fe mansion. Calls seeking comment from attorneys for Foggo and Wilkes were not immediately returned Friday. Michael's attorney, Howard Frank, said he had not read the indictment and had no comment. The initial charges came 20 months after the opened an investigation into Cunningham, who served on key House committees with oversight of government contracts. He pleaded guilty in November 2005 to taking $2.4 million in bribes from defense contractors and was sentenced to more than eight years in prison. Foggo and Wilkes played high school football together, and after graduating in 1972, they roomed together at San Diego State University, were best men at each other's weddings and named their sons after each other.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/usspacematter NASA says it has found proof of existence of dark matter says it has found proof of existence of dark matter 2 hours, 36 minutes ago WASHINGTON (AFP) - US astronomers on Tuesday presented the most solid proof yet of the existence of dark matter, a mysterious substance believed to make up more than a quarter of the universe. spotted a ring of dark matter in a galaxy cluster some five billion light-years away from Earth, which measured some 2.6 million light-years across. "This is the first time we have detected dark matter as having a unique structure that is different from the gas and galaxies in the cluster," said James Jee, a member of NASA&#39;s team of astronomers. Astronomers have long suspected there must be some substance holding galaxy clusters together, otherwise galaxies would only have the gravity from their visible stars, which would not be enough to keep them from flying apart. Though invisible, astronomers have inferred dark matter exists by observing how its gravity bends the light of more distant background galaxies. "Although the invisible matter has been found before in other galaxy clusters, it has never been detected to be so largely separated from the hot gas and the galaxies that make up galaxy clusters," said Jee, who works at the Johns Hopkins University. "By seeing a dark matter structure that is not traced by galaxies and hot gas, we can study how it behaves differently from normal matter," he said. US astronomers said they made the discovery accidentally while mapping the distribution of dark matter within the ZwC10024+1652 cluster in August 2006. As they studied their data the astronomers noticed a ripple in the dark matter, similar to ripples created when a stone is plopped into a pond. Jee said that at first he was upset when he found the ring because he thought there was a flaw in the team&#39;s data reduction. He then found research published in 2002 suggesting that the cluster under observation had collided with another cluster one to two billion years ago. The collision occurred along Earths line of sight, and from this perspective the dark-matter structure looks like a ring. In a computer simulation of a galaxy clusters collision, dark matter first falls to the center of the combined cluster, then moves outward but begins to slow under the pull of gravity. described the phenomenon in a statement as being "like cars bunched up on a highway." "Nature is doing an experiment for us that we can&#39;t do in a lab, and it agrees with our theoretical models," said team member Holland Ford, also of Johns Hopkins University. The galaxy cluster collision "created a ripple of dark matter which left distinct footprints in the shapes of the background galaxies," said Jee. "It&#39;s like looking at the pebbles on the bottom of a pond with ripples on the surface. The pebbles&#39; shapes appear to change as the ripples pass over them," Jee said. "So, too, the background galaxies behind the ring show coherent changes in their shapes due to the presence of the dense ring."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/climate_energy_dc Clean technology bigger than Internet: software guru technology bigger than Internet: software guru FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A global response to climate change will spur a business revolution bigger than the internet, said co-founder of Sun Microsystems Bill Joy. "This is a much larger opportunity," he told Reuters, pointing to the scale of the problem and the profits to be made from simple steps like a more careful use of energy. "It&#39;s profitable to be more efficient, it has a negative cost and a competitive disadvantage if you don&#39;t do it." "You can sensibly adopt old technology, not drive a truck, or insulate your house," he said, speaking on the fringes of the Cleantech investor conference in Frankfurt. Joy made his name creating and developing computer operating systems and microprocessors, for example helping to design the Java programming language. Most scientists agree that climate change is being caused by mankind&#39;s emissions of greenhouse gases, especially the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil. Using the example of the car industry, Joy saw the response in three parts: first using old technologies like smaller, more efficient cars; second adopting emerging technologies like "hybrid," part-electric cars; and third researching breakthroughs such as transport fuels derived from farm waste. Climate change would spur innovation and California&#39;s Silicon Valley, which originally served the semiconductor industry, was well placed to benefit, he said. "Solar cells are semiconductors, heat to electricity is semiconductors, software to manage systems comes out of Silicon Valley," said Joy, who is now a partner at venture capital investors Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB). A global race is on to be first to commercialize breakthrough technologies which could make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Research into safer, rechargeable lithium batteries is taking place mainly in the United States and Canada, but innovation in small electric cars is centered in Asia and Europe, he said. "Smart people are everywhere." Future breakthroughs will include more efficient solar cells that convert waste heat to electricity, and manipulation of catalysts at the ultra-tiny, or nano, scale to cut costs. Climate change will create business losers, too: for example among U.S. car manufacturers which have resisted fuel efficiency standards, Joy reckoned. "They lobbied Washington against innovation. The industry is now really in trouble, the car companies didn&#39;t innovate. Everyone&#39;s basically driving a truck."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/usa_military_officers_dc U.S. Army faces shortage of junior officers: memo Army faces shortage of junior officers: memo Mon May 14, 5:15 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Army, stretched thin by wars in , has only half of the senior captains it needs and will offer money and other incentives to keep those officers, according to a memo obtained by Reuters on Monday. The number of senior captains, or captains closest to promotion, stands at just 51 percent of the Army&#39;s requirements, according to a memo from Col. George Lockwood, director of officer personnel management at the Army&#39;s Human Resources Command. Lockwood said the strains of the U.S.-declared "Global War on Terror" had contributed to the shortage of officers at the rank of captain. Previous decisions to promote officers more quickly to meet targets for Army majors -- the rank above captain -- also had hurt the number of junior officers available, he said. "The Army is growing and implementing a number of programs to increase accessions, but new lieutenants will not substitute for senior captains," Lockwood wrote. "We must retain the talented officers we have developed and are seeking an aggressive overall company grade retention rate of 95 percent in all branches." Captains typically command company-sized units, or units with as many as 190 soldiers. Lockwood&#39;s memo marks the latest sign of the strain that U.S. military operations have placed on the Army -- the largest branch of the U.S. armed forces. With the Marine Corps, the Army has been most stressed by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which have taken a toll on manpower and equipment and left many units unprepared for another fight. Lockwood urged officers to encourage more junior officers to stay on active duty. According to his memo, the Army will offer &#36;20,000 bonuses and a limited number of slots for civilian graduate school, military school and language training. "If you&#39;re in a leadership position, you must scan your officer&#39;s records and identify those eligible for this program, and counsel them as soon as possible," Lockwood wrote.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/fbi_whistleblowers FBI whistle-blowers urge new protections whistle-blowers urge new protections Mon May 14, 8:46 PM ET whistle-blowers Monday supported protection for intelligence agency employees who expose government wrongdoing. The comments by Colleen Rowley and Michael German came as 40 public-interest organizations urged Congress to include national security workers in the Whistleblower Protection Act. The act outlawing retaliation against whistle-blowers does not apply to employees of most intelligence agencies. "Freedom to warn is a key concept," Rowley said at a panel discussion on Capitol Hill. Rowley's blistering memo to the FBI director helped focus attention on the law enforcement agency's shortcomings in the run-up to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. National security whistle-blowers often find themselves sidelined, without a security clearance and without a job, the American Civil Liberties Union American Civil Liberties Union said in a report. Former FBI agent Michael German, a focus of one ACLU case study, reported serious problems in a counterterrorism investigation, a move he says prompted retaliation that led him to resign in protest. German said his accusations ultimately were found to be true because of the persistence of Sen. Charles Grassley ( ), R-Iowa, who thanked German and Rowley for providing "valuable information to me in my efforts to oversee the FBI."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/eavesdropping White House pressed Ashcroft on wiretaps House pressed Ashcroft on wiretaps By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press WASHINGTON - A top Justice Department official thought 's no-warrant wiretapping program was so questionable that he refused for a time to reauthorize it, leading to a standoff with White House officials at the bedside of the ailing attorney general, a Senate panel was told Tuesday. Former Deputy Attorney General James Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he refused to recertify the program because Attorney General had reservations about its legality just before falling ill with pancreatitis in March 2004. The White House, Comey said, recertified the program without the Justice Department's signoff, allowing it to operate for about three weeks without concurrence on whether it was legal. Comey, Ashcroft, Director Robert Mueller and other Justice Department officials at one point considered resigning, Comey said. "I couldn't stay, if the administration was going to engage in conduct that the had said had no legal basis," Comey told the panel. A day after the March 10, 2004, incident at Ashcroft's hospital bedside, President Bush ordered changes to the program to accommodate the department's concerns. Ashcroft signed the presidential order to recertify the program about three weeks later. The dramatic hospital confrontation involved Comey, the acting attorney general during Ashcroft's absence, and a White House team that included Bush's then-counsel, Alberto Gonzales, and White House Chief of Staff Andy Card, Comey said. Gonzales later succeeded Ashcroft as attorney general. Senior government officials had expressed concerns about whether the National Security Agency, which administered the warrantless eavesdropping program, had the proper oversight in place. Other concerns included whether any president possessed the legal and constitutional authority to authorize the program as it operated at the time. Comey testified Tuesday that when he refused to certify the program, Gonzales and Card headed to Ashcroft's sick bed in the intensive care unit at George Washington University Hospital. When Gonzales appealed to Ashcroft, the ailing attorney general lifted his head off the pillow and in straightforward terms described his views of the program, Comey said. Then he pointed out that Comey, not Ashcroft, held the powers of the attorney general at that moment. Gonzales and Card then left the hospital room, Comey said. "I was angry," Comey told the panel. "I thought I had just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man who did not have the powers of the attorney general." Comey's testimony revived one of the Bush administration's most bitter internal fights just as Gonzales appeared less under siege about the firings of several U.S. attorneys last year. Bush has stood solidly by his longtime counselor's side; calls for Gonzales' resignation have waned in recent weeks. Asked about Comey's testimony, White House press secretary Tony Snow said he didn't know anything about the conversation at Ashcroft's bedside. But he defended the program. "Because he had an appendectomy, his brain didn't work?" Snow said of Ashcroft. "Jim Comey can talk about whatever reservations he may have had. But the fact is that there were strong protections in there, this program has saved lives and it's vital for national security and furthermore has been reformed in a bipartisan way." Dean Boyd, a Justice Department spokesman, said he couldn't comment on "internal discussions that may or may have not taken place concerning classified intelligence activities." But he said the program succeeded in helping detect and prevent terrorist attacks and was always subject to rigorous oversight and review. Democrats cited Comey's testimony as evidence of what they say is Gonzales' tendency to put loyalty to Bush ahead of most everything &#151; including Justice's tradition of independence from the politics of the White House. "What happened in that hospital room crystallized Mr. Gonzales' view about the rule of law: that he holds it in minimum low regard," said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Under questioning by Sen. Arlen Specter ( ), R-Pa., Comey said he was not threatened by Vice President or other White House officials who disagreed with him on the legality of the eavesdropping program. Comey recalled that after the bedside incident he started to offer his resignation and was persuaded to wait a few days until Ashcroft could resign with him. "Mr. Ashcroft's chief of staff asked me something that meant a great deal to him, and that is that I not resign until Mr. Ashcroft was well enough to resign with me," Comey said. On March 12 at their daily briefing of the president, Bush asked Comey and Mueller for separate private conversations on Justice's concerns about the eavesdropping program. There, Comey said, Bush agreed to do "the right thing." "We had the president's direction to do what we believed, what the Justice Department believed, was necessary to put this matter on a footing where we could certify to its legality," Comey said of the period after those private meetings. "We did that." Spokesmen for Ashcroft and Mueller refused requests for comment.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/guantanamo_detainees Judges focus on Guantanamo Bay tribunals focus on Guantanamo Bay tribunals By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 2 minutes ago WASHINGTON - Two federal appeals court judges subjected a Bush administration attorney to intense questioning Tuesday as lawyers for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay pleaded for a broad court inquiry on behalf of the detainees. Judges Judith Rogers and Douglas Ginsburg expressed skepticism about government assurances that the appeals court will receive all necessary evidence in evaluating the detainees' status as enemy combatants. "I don't see how there can be any meaningful review if we don't know what we don't know," Ginsburg told a government attorney. The latest chapter in the cases of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay is about military tribunals that designated them enemy combatants, leaving them without any of the rights accorded prisoners of war. Justice Department lawyer Douglas Letter said an extensive record of classified and unclassified material on the tribunal proceedings will be supplied to the court. Congress intended for the court's review to be a narrow one, Letter emphasized. Letter said the tribunals largely duplicate long-standing procedures laid out in the Army Field Manual. "You'd better not invoke that," Rogers admonished the Justice Department lawyer. "We don't have all those" procedures here. Rogers is a Clinton appointee; Ginsburg, the chief judge of the appeals court, is a Reagan appointee; and the third member of the panel, Karen Lecraft Henderson, is an appointee of A year ago, the Republican-controlled Congress at the urging of the Bush administration stripped the prisoners of the right to challenge their indefinite detention. The only challenge detainees can make is to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, for the limited purpose of assessing the military tribunal procedures. "This is our only chance to go back to the government well," attorney Jeffrey Lang told the judges. The two cases before the appeals court involve Haji Bismullah, an Afghan, and seven men who are Uighurs, Muslims from China who are a persecuted minority in that country. They are among the 380 detainees at Guantanamo Bay, some of them held for more than five years. The detainees' attorneys want the appeals court to allow a broad inquiry questioning the accuracy and completeness of the evidence the tribunals gathered about the detainees, most of it classified. The Justice Department seeks a limited review, saying that the findings of the military tribunals are "entitled to the highest level of deference." The appeals court should not engage in fact-finding, argues the Justice Department. An attorney who heard the arguments, Shayana Kadidal of the Center for Constitutional Rights, called it "striking" that the appeals court judges expressed interest in a broader inquiry. The center has led the effort to gain access to the U.S. court system for the detainees.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/cable_choice Cable customers' choices being debated customers' choices being debated By JOHN DUNBAR, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 34 minutes ago WASHINGTON - Sports fans everywhere want to know: "Why do I have to subscribe to the soap opera channel when all I really want is ESPN?" That's the kind of question the cable TV industry hates answering. The channel choice issue comes up every few years, but people who argue that subscribers should be able to choose channels "a la carte" have never made any real headway. The latest effort, and the newest reasoning for requiring cable companies to offer channel choice, or a la carte cable, has to do with yet another issue: television violence. released a report in late April suggesting to Congress that an a la carte system would allow parents to shield their children from violent shows by not subscribing to the channels that carry them. FCC Chairman Kevin Martin, who has been unshakable in his support of channel choice, says it can't happen without federal legislation. And thus far, the issue has gotten little traction on Capitol Hill. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., who is expected to unveil a bill addressing television violence any day now, has opposed the creation of an a la carte system. The overall lack of support might seem surprising, considering that the average household in 2006 received 104 channels, yet tuned in to only 16 of them, according to the Nielsen TV ratings company. If we aren't watching all those channels, why can't we just pick the ones we want and avoid paying for the rest? The answer lies within the arcane world of cable television economics. In the old days (pre-1970s), cable systems provided viewers with broadcast channels that viewers couldn't tune in because the signals were too weak where they lived. Since then, there has been a steady growth in cable-only channels, starting with popular ones such as HBO, CNN, MTV and ESPN. Federal law requires cable companies to offer a bare bones, "basic tier" of service, consisting of local broadcast and public access channels. The second tier, commonly known as "expanded basic," includes most of the major cable networks. There's usually no choice on this tier; subscribers get all the channels or none of them. Beyond that, subscribers may pick premium channels like HBO, that are priced separately. Unlike over-the-air broadcasters, which rely almost entirely on advertising to stay in business, cable networks earn about half their revenue from per-subscriber charges levied on cable system operators. Those costs are passed on to cable subscribers. Two types of companies dominate the cable industry: those that own both broadcast and cable networks (like Walt Disney Co.); and those that own both cable systems and cable networks (like Time Warner Inc.). Disney, for example, owns the ABC television network, which feeds programming to 228 affiliates, several popular cable-only channels (80 percent of ESPN) and several not-as-popular cable channels (SOAPnet). Cable customers demand that their local cable company carry the ABC affiliate so they can watch popular shows such as Desperate Housewives and Lost, or catch the local news. Disney can charge the cable operator to carry the ABC network, but the cable operator can avoid the cost by agreeing to carry other, less-popular Disney-owned networks. The second model is a form of vertical integration, or ownership of the cable delivery system as well as its programming content. Time Warner owns the second-largest cable television service in the nation with 13.4 million subscribers. It also owns some of the most popular cable channels in the United States. That means that Time Warner the cable system owner has to negotiate with Time Warner the cable channel owner to provide programming. In a nutshell, the cable television business is a closed, profitable system with a small number of very large players who negotiate secret deals with one another and have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. "The whole system feeds on itself," said Jeannine Kenney, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "It's almost like everyone benefits except for the consumer and the independent content provider." An a la carte regime would blow up that system and disrupt its economic model. And that would lead to higher prices and less programming diversity, according to the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, an industry trade group. Fewer channels would mean less advertising and fewer advertising dollars. An a la carte system would also require more customer service representatives, higher billing costs and higher marketing costs. These factors and others would ultimately lead to higher rates for consumers, according to the NCTA. The bottom line, though, is there is no way of knowing for sure. A 2003 GAO report stated that "a variety of factors" make it "difficult to ascertain how many consumers would be better off and how many would be made worse off under an a la carte approach." Consumers Union has lobbied long and hard for a la carte, saying it would put a halt to steadily rising cable prices. It has an ally in the Parents Television Council, a group that successfully pushed for higher fines for broadcast stations that air raunchy programming. The opponent is the cable industry, led by the NCTA, which issues press statements every time Martin utters the words "a la carte." Cable networks that cater to minorities are fearful of cable choice. They worry that it will drop their subscriber base dramatically and run them out of business. (The biggest minority networks, such as Black Entertainment Television, are owned by big cable or broadcast companies.) Cable's closed system has developed largely because of the industry's status as a monopoly for most of its early years. Even when direct broadcast satellite providers like Dish Network and DirecTV came on the scene and cut heavily into cable's customer base, the system still didn't change much. The same programming rules that apply to cable apply to satellite; if you want the popular channels, you have take the unpopular channels. Prior to Martin's anti-violence crusade, the most high-profile supporter of a la carte was Sen. John McCain ( ), R-Ariz. Under former FCC Chairman Michael Powell, the agency released a report that relied heavily on a cable-industry sponsored study that concluded "few consumers would experience lower bills" under an a la carte system. In early 2006, with Martin in charge, the agency released another study, the first 30 pages of which were dedicated to refuting the first study. This one concluded that "Consumers could be better off under a la carte. ..." Now the price argument has been overshadowed by the issue of content. The Parents Television Council and Martin argue that the best way to protect children from gory or tawdry programming is to give parents the option of keeping certain channels out of the lineup. Supporters say an a la carte system is more palatable constitutionally than imposing rules to restrict the airing of violent content during certain hours of the day. Thus far, Congress has yet to bite on it. Rockefeller hasn't introduced his bill, and when he does, an a la carte regime will not be part of it, according to spokeswoman Wendy Morigi. The No. 1 contributor to the senator's political campaigns over his career in federal politics, according to the Center for Responsive Politics: Time Warner. Morigi said Rockfeller doesn't create legislation based on contributions, and predicted "the cable industry will both support and oppose some of the provisions" in his bill.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/veterans_care_bonuses VA bonus winners sat on review boards bonus winners sat on review boards By HOPE YEN, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON - Nearly two dozen officials who received hefty performance bonuses last year at the Veterans Affairs Department also sat on the boards charged with recommending the payments. Documents obtained by The Associated Press raise questions of conflict of interest in connection with the bonuses, some of which went to senior officials involved in crafting a budget that came up $1.3 billion short and jeopardized veterans' health care. The documents show that 21 of 32 officials who were members of VA performance review boards received more than half a million dollars in payments themselves. Among them: nearly a dozen senior officials who devised the flawed 2005 budget. Also rewarded was the deputy undersecretary for benefits, who manages a system with severe backlogs of veterans waiting for disability benefits. Some members of the review boards, which are appointed by VA Secretary Jim Nicholson, also had input on bonus recommendations involving themselves, fellow members and spouses that made questionable performance claims and neglected agency problems. The VA, which has defended the bonuses as necessary to retain hardworking senior employees, says board members do not participate in bonus decisions that involve themselves or fellow board members. In those cases, recommendations are made by agency heads in consultation with deputy undersecretaries who sit on the boards, the agency says. But government watchdogs were harshly critical, saying the process does little to instill public confidence in the fairness of awards. In its last known report on the issue &#151; one involving in 1980 urged that performance boards add credibility and objectivity to their decisions by including "one or more impartial members from outside the agency," although agencies are not required to do so. With the exception of a panel tasked with reviewing the VA inspector general's office, all the VA's performance board members come from within the agency. In one case, Michael Walcoff, associate deputy undersecretary for field operations who sits on two of the review boards, and his wife, Kimberly, a VA director, received a package of bonuses totaling $42,000. "This is a scandal in the making," said Paul C. Light, professor of public service at New York University who specializes in government reform. He said the VA bonuses pointed to possible "featherbedding" and other favoritism. Light said given the current problems in veterans care, the department would be best served if Nicholson restricted most performance bonuses for at least a year except in cases of clear improvement. "This is not the time for largesse for the Department of Veterans Affairs Department of Veterans Affairs ," Light said. "They must not make a link between retention and employees, but employees and performance as an incentive to solve these very serious problems." Following reports this month by the AP of the $3.8 million in bonuses, groups such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Veterans of America have called on Nicholson to explain why officials involved in budget foul-ups would be rewarded. Annual bonuses to senior VA officials last year averaged more than $16,000, the highest average in government. Rep. John Hall ( ), D-N.Y., has introduced legislation that would freeze 2007 VA bonuses for "senior politically appointed officers" &#151; such as assistant secretaries or deputy undersecretaries &#151; until the agency pares its disability claims backlog to under 100,000 cases. "It is simply unacceptable that veterans are waiting longer and longer for benefits they desperately need while senior staff members in charge of bad policy are rewarded so-called performance bonuses," Hall said. The legislation, originally scheduled for a vote Tuesday, was expected to be considered along with other veterans health care bills later this month, a spokeswoman for Hall said. Under a federal law passed in 1978 to increase government accountability by tying bonuses more closely to performance, agencies are required to appoint performance review boards yearly to guarantee bonus awards are "fair and credible." According to guidance by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, performance boards must ensure that bonuses are given based not only on individual accomplishments cited by supervisors, but also the department's overall success. However, 2006 bonus proposals obtained by the AP show that senior officials who received top payments of $33,000 were sometimes credited for achievements that were questionable, if not inaccurate. Also, no mention was made of agency-wide problems. _Rita Reed, deputy assistant secretary for budget: "Demonstrated the ability to design and implement strategies that maximize employee potential and foster high ethical standards in meeting the organization's mission and goals." While touting her role in launching programs to "leverage the VA's buying power" as well as collecting $5.1 million in erroneous payments, the proposal does not mention Reed's lead role in crafting the VA's flawed 2005 budget. Months prior to her bonus award, GAO investigators determined the VA had used misleading accounting to justify health cuts, claiming false savings in part by double-counting savings from volume purchasing in government contracts from year to year. _William Feeley, deputy undersecretary for health for operations and management: "Made numerous contributions to veterans and the Veterans Health Administration in his role as deputy undersecretary." It said he also led systemwide improvements that resulted in a 2.2 percent decrease in wait times for primary care. Feeley received a top bonus and is credited for yearlong achievements even though he did not take the job until February 2006, nearly halfway into the fiscal year. Previously, he was a VA regional director who played a role in the flawed 2005 budget. Regarding veterans' wait times to see doctors, a 2005 report from the VA inspector general found that VA schedulers routinely put the wrong requested appointment dates into the system, which made reported wait times appear shorter than they really were. The IG has said problems lingered in 2006 despite VA promises. _Ronald Aument, deputy undersecretary for benefits: "His knowledge of VBA programs and operations and his breadth of experiences across VA have contributed greatly to VBA's progress in improving services to veterans." Aument helps manage a disability claims system that has backlogs of 400,000 to 600,000 veterans. The waits average 177 days, two months short of the VA's strategic goal of 125 days to process claims. Nicholson has called the delays unacceptable. Aument also is praised in his bonus proposal for requesting needed money and resources. The VA is now moving to hire additional case managers to reduce short-staffing after problems were brought to light following disclosures of shoddy outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/fort_drum_missing_soldiers Missing soldiers from Fort Drum soldiers from Fort Drum FORT DRUM, N.Y. - The seven American victims of a weekend ambush in were members of the storied 10th Mountain Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Army officials in Iraq said Tuesday. The attack near Mahmoudiya, in a Sunni stronghold 20 miles south of Baghdad, left four U.S. soldiers and an Iraqi translator dead, and three other soldiers missing. acknowledged for the first time that it believes the missing soldiers are in terrorist hands. The Islamic State of Iraq &#151; an al-Qaida front group that has claimed to have captured the soldiers &#151; has warned the U.S. to stop its massive search for the missing. Military officials would not release the names of the soldiers until their families were notified but confirmed they were assigned to Company D, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, nicknamed the "Polar Bears," said Lt. Col. Paul Fitzpatrick, a Fort Drum spokesman. All the missing soldiers are men, Fitzpatrick said. "It's been the unfortunate experience that soldiers who have been captured have not all turned out well. We are hoping this turns out to be an exception," he said. The 10th Mountain Division has a reputation for success that dates to World War II. Ready to go anywhere in the world within 48 hours, the 10th Mountain is trained to fight in steamy jungles, sandy deserts, cities and, of course, mountains. Families of the soldiers released the names of two of the dead on Monday &#151; Sgt. 1st Class James David Connell Jr., 40, of Lake City, Tenn., and Pfc. Daniel Courneya, 19, of Vermontville, Mich. Connell's family learned of his death Saturday afternoon, they said. The soldier had just recovered from a shrapnel wound to the leg and had visited his family on leave this month. The family is now planning a memorial service in Lake City and a burial at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his brother, Jeff Connell. "I'm proud of my dad, because he didn't really fight for himself, he fought for the country," Connell's teenage daughter, Courtney, told Knoxville's WATE-TV. In Michigan, students at Maple Valley High School created a memorial for Courneya, who graduated in 2005 and was well-known in the small community southwest of Lansing. He was a member of the school's track and soccer teams and played clarinet in the band. "It's a tribute of photos, posters, plaques and a picture of him in his uniform," school official Kelly Zank told The Associated Press on Tuesday. His death was announced Monday over the school's public address system, and a moment of silence was observed, she said. Courneya's mother, Wendy Thompson, said his wife, Jennifer, called family members Saturday night to tell them he had been killed. Thompson said her husband, Army Spc. David Thompson, was in Iraq and returning home after learning of his stepson's death. If all three soldiers now missing were taken alive, it would be the biggest single abduction of U.S. soldiers in Iraq since March 23, 2003, when Pvt. Jessica Lynch and six others were captured in an ambush near Nasiriyah that also left 11 Americans dead. The 2nd Brigade Combat Team is in the 10th month of a 15-month tour in Iraq. The brigade was also deployed to Iraq in 2005. The 10th Mountain Division made its reputation in World War II, when soldiers scaled a sheer, 1,500-foot cliff under cover of darkness and fought their way through the snowy mountains of northern Italy in 1945. That spearheaded the drive that would liberate the country from the Nazis. The 10th Mountain was the Army's most frequently deployed division during the 1990s, serving in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere. The division's members became the first regular U.S. ground troops to be sent to Central Asia as part of American's response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Its soldiers provided security for U.S. Air Force fighter and combat search-and-rescue teams in Uzbekistan.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/creditcards_congress_dc Democrats aim to rein in credit card abuses aim to rein in credit card abuses PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. Senate Democrats introduced a bill on Tuesday that would limit credit card fees and interest rate hikes that can bury consumers in debt. "I&#39;m afraid these practices have become too entrenched and too profitable to the credit card companies for the companies to change them on their own," Carl Levin ( ) of Michigan said in a statement. "Congress needs to enact pro-consumer legislation to put an end to these unfair practices." The bill, sponsored by Levin and Claire McCaskill ( ) of Missouri, calls for an end to abusive practices that can result in a downward spiral of mounting debt for some card holders. It would prohibit interest rate hikes on a credit card account unless the card holder agrees to them and would limit penalty interest rate hikes to no more than a 7 percent increase. The legislation would also ban a credit card issuer from repeatedly charging over-limit fees for a single instance of a card holder exceeding a credit card limit, and prohibit interest charges on transaction fees such as late fees and over-the-limit fees, Levin said. "Credit card companies are so profitable that they can afford to give up unfair practices," Levin said. Levin introduced the bill after holding a March hearing, where a senior executive with JPMorgan Chase & Co.&#39;s Chase Bank USA apologized to a 29-year-old Ohio man who repaid twice the amount of a &#36;3,200 bill because of interest and fees. Outstanding U.S. credit card debt total &#36;750 billion in November, according to estimates. The industry has more than 640 million credit cards in circulation. Levin said the bill would be sent to the Senate Banking Committee for consideration.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/ushealthgovernmentpolitics US health system ranks last compared to other countries: studies health system ranks last compared to other countries: studies AM ET WASHINGTON (AFP) - The US health care system ranks last among other major rich countries for quality, access and efficiency, according to two studies released Tuesday by a health care think tank. The studies by the Commonwealth Fund found that the United States, which has the most expensive health system in the world, underperforms consistently relative to other countries and differs most notably in the fact that Americans have no universal health insurance coverage. "The United States stands out as the only nation in these studies that does not ensure access to health care through universal coverage and promotion of a &#39;medical home&#39; for patients," said Commonwealth Fund president Karen Davis. "Our failure to ensure health insurance for all and encourage stable, long-term ties between physicians and patients shows in our poor performance on measures of quality, access, efficiency, equity, and health outcomes." In "Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: An International Update on the Comparative Performance of American Health Care", the study focused on interviews with physicians and patients in Australia, Britain, Canada, Germany, New Zealand and the United States who were asked to speak about their experiences and views on their health systems. The US ranked last in most areas, including access to health care, patient safety, timeliness of care, efficiency and equity. Americans were also last in terms of whether they had a regular physician. "The US spends twice what the average industrialized country spends on health care but we&#39;re clearly not getting value for the money," Davis told AFP. She also noted that 45 million Americans, or 15 percent of the US population, have no health insurance, which contributes to the country&#39;s medical woes. The United States is also far behind in adopting modern health information technology, which translates into spiralling costs and poor care. "We pride ourselves on being advanced on so many areas of technology but it&#39;s not the case on health information technology," Davis said. "Other countries have just moved ahead." Britain got the top score in overall ranking among the countries in the study, followed by Germany. New Zealand and Australia tied for third followed by Canada and the United States. The second study delves into why health costs in the United States are so much higher than in eight other countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development: Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and New Zealand. The study, "Multinational Comparisons of Health Systems Data," found that even though the US spends the most on publicly and privately financed health insurance, its citizens had the most potential years of life lost due to circulatory and respiratory diseases as well as diabetes. "This study blows a lot of myths about the US health system," Davis said. "We spend three times what the average country spends on a day of hospital care and we also spend twice what the average country spends on prescription medication." Health care is likely to be a prominent issue in the 2008 US presidential elections with various candidates already promising to tackle rising costs and the burden placed on big business to provide health insurance.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/nazi_archive Sealed Nazi archives to be released Nazi archives to be released By ARTHUR MAX, Associated Press Writer AMSTERDAM, Netherlands - Copies of documents from a secretive Nazi archive, locked away in a quiet German town for more than 50 years, will be released to Holocaust institutions within a few months under an agreement reached Tuesday. The documents will give historians an intimate view of the systematic slaughter of millions during the Holocaust, and will let survivors and victims' families search for their own histories &#151; as recorded by their tormentors. The 11-nation governing body of the International Tracing Service, which runs the archive in Bad Arolsen, Germany, voted to sidestep legal obstacles and begin distributing electronic copies of the documents to member states as soon as they are ready. The archive contains Nazi records on the arrest, transportation, incarceration, forced labor and deaths of millions of people from the year the Nazis built their first concentration camp in 1933 to the end of the war in May 1945. It also has a vast collection of postwar records from displaced persons camps. The name index refers to 17.5 million victims, and the documents fill 16 miles of shelves. Until now, the files have been used to track missing people, reunite families and validate restitution claims. The Tracing Service is an arm of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The decision to release the copies circumvents the requirement to withhold them until all 11 countries ratify 2006 treaty amendments that enabled the unsealing of the archive. It was likely to speed up the distribution of the documents by several months. Institutions that receive the documents can organize the electronic files and integrate them into their own archival systems, but they are prohibited from allowing access to researchers until the ratification process is complete, said archive director Reto Meister. 's Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, which sent a representative to the meeting, welcomed the decision. "I am delighted to see this project moving forward," said the memorial's director Avner Shalev. "This was a huge hurdle for many people" on the commission, said J. Christian Kennedy, the State Department's special envoy for Holocaust issues. He said the U.S. government would work to ensure the final four countries ratify the accord quickly. Those countries &#151; Italy, Greece, Luxembourg and France &#151; have all pledged to endorse the agreement by the fall, Meister said. The U.S., Israel, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland and Germany have already finished the legal process. Meister said the first 10 million pages &#151; about one-fifth of the documents &#151; will be ready for transfer to the countries by early September, with another huge batch following in November. The U.S., France and Germany pledged to donate more than $700,000 to offset costs for preparing and transmitting the papers, Kennedy said, just short of the amount needed. Seized by the Allies from concentration camps and Nazi offices after the war, the files were closed under a 1955 agreement to protect the privacy of survivors and the reputation of the dead who may have undergone humiliating medical experiments or been falsely accused of crimes. Few people were allowed to see the actual papers. Since 1955, the archive has received more than 11 million requests for information, but it often responded with form letters giving minimal information. Sometimes, copies of documents were given to families. Meister, a Swiss diplomat who took over as head of the Tracing Service earlier this year, said that approach is changing. "People have the right to see their files. It's their files. They may be written by the Gestapo. Ultimately, this is the property of the person whose name appears there. Somebody who visits us gets the original to see, to touch, to receive a copy," Meister said. Last year's amendments to the 1955 accords, reached after years of negotiations and resistance by several members, stipulated that some privacy guarantees remain. A single copy of the documents would be available for inclusion in the 11 member states' archives, but each government was expected to take into account "the sensitivity of certain information" the files may contain, the new agreement said. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and Yad Vashem in Jerusalem already have already asked for copies. France also has expressed an interest. Earlier at the meeting, delegates agreed to declassify all correspondence with the Tracing Service dating back more than 25 years. The correspondence covers requests and responses for information by individuals and governments, including requests by the U.S. for the files of former Nazis suspected of visa fraud when they immigrated.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/usjusticepolitics US attorneys scandal deepens with key resignation attorneys scandal deepens with key resignation AM ET WASHINGTON (AFP) - The resignation of US Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez&#39;s right-hand man has invigorated Democrats who want to see more heads roll in a deepening scandal over the sacking of federal prosecutors. Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty, a key Republican operative and ally of President George W. Bush President George W. Bush , on Monday became the fourth official to resign over the firings. The affair has sparked anger among Democrats, who say the nine attorneys were sacked for refusing to bow to political pressure to follow up legal cases which would benefit Bush&#39;s Republican party. McNulty, the second ranking official in the US , said he planned to step down for personal reasons, likely this summer, once a replacement is found. In a letter to Gonzales, McNulty, 49, said he was leaving because "the financial realities of college-age children and two decades of public service lead me to a long overdue transition in my career." McNulty played a key role in the Justice Department because he oversaw the office that managed US attorneys, and also dealt with department policy issues and efforts against corporate fraud. Despite McNulty&#39;s high rank, he was not believed to have been closely involved with the decision to fire the eight attorneys. "McNulty&#39;s resignation is a sign that top-level administration at the Justice Department may be crumbling under the pressure of ongoing revelations, and what is yet to be disclosed," Chairman John Conyers ( ) was quoted as saying by the Washington Post. "With this news and as we press on with our investigation, we look forward to his cooperation." Democratic Senator Charles Schumer ( ) also renewed his call for Gonzales to face consequences. "This administration owes us a lot better," Schumer said, calling it "ironic" that McNulty had to go while Gonzales remained in charge. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel ( ) said Democrats "will continue our aggressive investigation into this serious matter," and added: "Resignations are no substitute for the truth." Most of the attorneys were sacked in one fell swoop last December, ostensibly for poor performance. Gonzales has admitted to mistakes in his handling of the issue but insisted no moves were made for political gain. According to media reports, McNulty had grown distant from Gonzalez in recent months, and angered his boss by his February testimony to Congress in which he linked White House political officials to the firings. McNulty testified that one of the fired prosecutors, Bud Cummins of Arkansas, had done nothing wrong but was dismissed to make room for a protege of White House senior advisor Karl Rove. After McNulty&#39;s announcement that he planned to leave his post, Gonzales issued a written statement in which he did not mention the scandal over the firings but praised McNulty&#39;s record. "The Department of Justice will be losing a dynamic and thoughtful leader with the departure of Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty," Gonzales said in a statement. He added that McNulty had been instrumental in efforts against corporate fraud and had made "significant contributions to establishing the rule of law in In his earlier position as a US attorney in Virginia, McNulty prosecuted key cases linked to the US war on terror, including those of John Walker Lindh, Ahmed Omar Abu Ali and Zacarias Moussaoui.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/iraq_media_ban No photos allowed after Iraqi blasts photos allowed after Iraqi blasts By KIM GAMEL, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 6 minutes ago BAGHDAD - Police fired warning shots in the air at the scene of a double bombing Tuesday, enforcing an order banning news photographers and TV camera operators from filming the aftermath of deadly bombings. The Iraqi government said it decided last weekend to keep photographers and camera crews away from blast sites to prevent them from damaging forensic evidence. Media groups feared the order was aimed at preventing scenes of horrific carnage from being broadcast around the world. The ban got its first test Tuesday, when a pair of bombs hidden in plastic bags exploded in two shops selling CDs and cigarettes in Tayaran Square in central Baghdad. Police said at least seven people were killed and 17 wounded. News photographers and cameraman rushed to the scene only to be turned away by Iraqi police, who fired warning shots in the air to disperse the crowds. Interior Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Abdul-Karim Khalaf defended the decision and said it would only last for an hour after the explosion. He said the move was not designed to curtail press freedom but to protect evidence and the privacy of the wounded. He also said the government wanted to keep insurgents from filming the scene for use in propaganda videos. "I would like to say that this is not a total ban. It is a short ban because after one hour from the explosion, journalists will have the freedom to do their work," he added, saying the ban was nationwide and would include the state-run TV station Iraqiya. Iraqi and U.S. authorities have frequently complained that the publicity surrounding car bombings and suicide attacks is jeopardizing their efforts to stop the violence, which has proven unrelenting as Sunni insurgents adopt new tactics to evade stepped-up security measures. Reporters Without Borders expressed concern about the decision, saying it "feared that growing restrictions on the media could end in a total news blackout." The international advocacy group stressed the importance of the images in providing an accurate assessment of the toll the violence is taking on Iraqi lives as well as the security situation in the capital, where movement is severely limited. "When the streets become impassable and the authorities provide no information about the attacks in real time, the role of the reporter becomes essential. Coverage of these attacks allows people to evaluate the security risk and to avoid dangerous areas," it said. Shihab al-Tamimi, the head of the Iraqi Journalists Union, said he understood the Interior Ministry's concerns. "But at the same time, the security forces should give more understanding to the work of journalists. The journalists have a job to do and they should be able to do it if it does not break a law. For example, if a photographer is after a picture at the explosion site, that does not make him a propagandist for insurgents," al-Tamimi said. Iraqi authorities often have been criticized for imposing media restrictions since the U.S.-led invasion that ousted In August 2004, the government closed the Baghdad news office of Al-Jazeera television, accusing the station of inciting violence. The office is still closed but the station operates in the Kurdish-ruled area of the north. Reporters Without Borders also noted that the Iraqi parliament voted May 9 to take legal action against Al-Jazeera over perceived insults against top Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. In December 2006, parliament also briefly banned journalists from covering its sessions. Earlier this month, Freedom House, a nonprofit organization that describes itself as a "clear voice for democracy and freedom around the world," cited the Iraqi government for retaining repressive laws from Saddam's era and for the detentions of journalists without charge.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/military_sites_blocked Pentagon limits troops' Web access limits troops' Web access By LOLITA C. BALDOR, Associated Press Writer Mon May 14, 8:45 PM ET WASHINGTON - Lt. Daniel Zimmerman, an infantry platoon leader in , puts a blog on the Internet every now and then "to basically keep my friends and family up to date" back home. It just got tougher to do that for Zimmerman and a lot of other U.S. soldiers. No more using the military's computer system to socialize and trade videos on MySpace, YouTube and more than a dozen others Web sites, the Citing security concerns and technological limits, the Pentagon has cut off access to those sites for personnel using the Defense Department's computer network. The change limits use of the popular outlets for service members on the front lines, who regularly post videos and journals. "I put my blog on there and my family reads it," said Zimmerman, 29, a platoon leader with B Company, 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment. "It scares the crap out of them sometimes," he said. "I keep it as vague as possible," he said. "I'm pretty responsible about it. It's just basically to tell a little bit about my life over here" he said. He's regularly at a base where he doesn't have Defense Department access to the Internet, but he has used it when he goes to bigger bases. He'll have to rely on a private account all the time now. Memos about the change went out in February, and it took effect last week. It does not affect the Internet cafes that soldiers in Iraq use that are not connected to the Defense Department's network. The cafe sites are run by a private vendor, FUBI (For US By Iraqis). Also, the Pentagon said that many of the military computers on the front lines in Iraq that are on the department's network had previously blocked the YouTube and MySpace sites. The ban also does not affect other sites, such as Yahoo, and does not prevent soldiers from sending messages and photos to their families by e-mail. Internet use has become a troublesome issue for the military as it struggles to balance security concerns with privacy rights. As blogs and video-sharing become more common, the military has voiced increasing concern about service members revealing details about military operations or other information about equipment or procedures that will aid the enemy. At the same time, service members have used the Web sites to chronicle their time in battle, posting videos and writing journals that provide a powerful, personal glimpse into their days at war. "These actions were taken to enhance and increase network security and protect the use of the bandwidth," said Col. Gary Keck, a Pentagon spokesman. The Pentagon said that use of the video sites in particular was putting a strain on the network, and also opening it to potential viruses or penetration by so-called "phishing" attacks in which scam artists try to steal sensitive data by mimicking legitimate Web sites. "The U.S. Army's not going to pay the bill for you to get on MySpace and YouTube," said Maj. Bruce Mumford, of Chester, Neb., who is serving as the brigade communications officer for the 4th Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, in Iraq. "Soldiers need to know what they can and cannot do, but we shouldn't be facilitating it." After the warnings of the shutdown went out, military members were allowed to seek waivers if the sites were necessary for their jobs. Often insurgent groups post videos, including ones of attacks or &#151; in some high profile cases &#151; of U.S. or coalition soldiers who have been captured or killed. "I guess it's a good general policy," Zimmerman said about the ban on MySpace and YouTube." If people could be trusted not to break operational security, then they wouldn't need to have the policy." If the restrictions are intended to prevent soldiers from giving or receiving bad news, they could also prevent them from providing positive reports from the field, said Noah Shachtman, who runs a national security blog for Wired Magazine. "This is as much an information war as it is bombs and bullets," he said. "And they are muzzling their best voices." Among the sites covered by the ban are the video-sharing sites YouTube, Metacafe, IFilm, StupidVideos and FileCabi; social networking sites MySpace, BlackPlanet and Hi5; music sites Pandora, MTV, 1.fm and live365, and the photo-sharing site Photobucket.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/pakistan_judicial_crisis Pakistan chief justice challenges ouster chief justice challenges ouster By SADAQAT JAN, Associated Press Writer PM ET ISLAMABAD, Pakistan - Pakistan's chief justice challenged his ouster at the hands of President Gen. Pervez Musharraf before the highest court Tuesday, alleging he had been held against his will for several hours in the leader's army office. Calm returned to much of Pakistan after weekend riots in Karachi that killed 41 people and a nationwide general strike Monday, refocusing attention on Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry's legal case challenging his suspension by Musharraf two months ago. The Supreme Court is examining more than 20 petitions contesting the legality of the suspension for alleged misconduct, including one filed by Chaudhry himself. Musharraf's move has been criticized that it amounted to an attack on the independence of the judiciary as he prepares to extend his nearly eight-year rule by seeking a new presidential term this fall. With Chaudhry himself absent, his lawyer, Aitzaz Ahsan, told the 13-judge bench that the chief justice had been summoned to Musharraf's army office in Rawalpindi on March 9 and held there against his will for several hours. Ahsan said Chaudhry had been pressured to resign &#151; but did not say by whom. "He sought several times to leave. ... He was physically prevented from leaving," Ahsan said in the cavernous, marble-walled courtroom, where the public gallery was packed with reporters and lawyers. Government officials have denied the allegation that Chaudhry was held against his will. A judicial complaints panel that assembled March 9 to consider Chaudhry's case had "no authority" to prevent Chaudhry from working because it had never asked for the judge's point of view, Ahsan said. Chaudhry also accuses several of the judges on the panel of bias against him. The panel's work has been suspended while the court considers the petitions. Government lawyer Sayed Sharifuddin Pirzada told the court that when the hearing resumes Wednesday, he would show that Chaudhry's petition was flawed and premature. Meanwhile, presiding Judge Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday said the court had "taken cognizance" of the mysterious shooting death of a Supreme Court official, Syed Hammad Raza, at his Islamabad home before dawn Monday. "Each one of us was as shocked and grieved as anyone could be grieved over the matter," Ramday said. "We are watching. This court is watching," he said. Police blamed robbers for the killing, but several relatives of Raza claimed it was a targeted killing, because nothing had been stolen from the house. Ahsan said Raza &#151; who had been appointed by Chaudhry in 2005 &#151; may have been under pressure to testify against the chief justice, but he offered no evidence to support his assertion. Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz has ordered a judicial inquiry into the killing and ordered authorities to do their utmost to catch those responsible, Aziz's office said. Opponents accuse Musharraf of removing the independent-minded Chaudhry, fearing he would uphold legal challenges to the president's continued rule. Musharraf denies the move was politically motivated. To press for Chaudhry's reinstatement, lawyers have mounted a series of growing protest rallies during hearings into the case, and he has traveled around the country to seek support. An abortive visit to Karachi on Saturday by Chaudhry triggered violence between supporters and opponents of the government, which security forces made little effort to stop. That led to accusations that it was condoned by Musharraf. On Monday, an opposition call for a general strike to protest the violence paralyzed cities across Pakistan. Shops were open again Tuesday in Karachi, a port city of 15 million, and the flow of traffic on the roads appeared to be back toward normal.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/space/hubblerevealsghostlyringofdarkmatter Hubble Reveals Ghostly Ring of Dark Matter Reveals Ghostly Ring of Dark Matter 2 hours, 38 minutes ago Astronomers have discovered an enormous, ghostly ring of dark matter 5 billion light-years away--the most blatant evidence to date for the existence of a mysterious substance hidden throughout the universe. Dark matter makes up a vast majority of gravity-exerting mass in the universe, while only about 10 percent is matter we can see and touch. If didn&#39;t exist, scientists say, galaxies like the Milky Way would have already flown apart from a severe lack of gravitational "glue." Researchers pointed the aging but powerful toward a cluster of galaxies known as cluster ZwCl0024+1652. At first glance, the then-unknown ring looked like a ripple in a pond over the twinkling galactic cluster. "I was annoyed when I saw the ring because I thought it was an artifact," said M. James Jee of Johns Hopkins University. But it wasn&#39;t a glitch. The more Jee and others tried to remove the ring by tweaking the data, the more the ring-like anomaly stuck out like sore thumb. "It took more than a year to convince myself that the ring was real," Jee said. "I&#39;ve looked at a number of clusters and I haven&#39;t seen anything like this." Because so much dark matter resides in the ring, astronomers said, it bends the light around it to create the ripple effect--dark matter&#39;s calling card. The findings were announced at a The ring, 2.6-million light-years wide, formed when two huge clusters of galaxies slammed together in a head-on collision roughly 1 to 2 billion years ago, puffing the mysterious matter outward, the astronomers figure. If the galactic hit-and-run had occurred outside of Earth&#39;s line-of-sight, the result might look more like an oval. , the ring is the first collection of dark matter that differs greatly from the distribution of ordinary matter. In addition to using gravity maps to visualize the dark matter itself, the team also created computer simulations showing what happens when galaxy clusters collide. When the two clusters smashed together, they think, dark matter fell to the center and then sloshed outward. As it did so, gravity eventually slowed it down and condensed it into a large ring detected by astronomers. "By studying this collision, we are seeing how dark matter responds to gravity," said Holland Ford, another Johns Hopkins astronomer on the team. "Nature is doing an experiment for us that we can&#39;t do in a lab, and it agrees with our theoretical models." Finding dark matter is not easy because it doesn&#39;t shine or reflect light. So astronomers rely on gravity, which can bend the light of distant stars when enough mass is present, much like a lens distorts an image behind it. Thanks to the laws of physics, knowing how much light is bent tells astronomers how much mass is there. By mapping the gravity&#39;s "footprint," astronomers were able to create a picture of how dark matter ring is distributed in the cluster. In the image of the cluster, Jee said, "the background galaxies behind the ring show coherent changes in their shapes due to the presence of the dense ring. It&#39;s like looking at the pebbles on the bottom of a pond with ripples on the surface."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/britain_ivory_ebay_dc eBay condemned for allowing "rampant" ivory trade condemned for allowing "rampant" ivory trade Mon May 14, 7:08 PM ET LONDON (Reuters) - The elephant, the world&#39;s largest land mammal, is being threatened with global extinction by a "rampant trade" in ivory on the eBay online auction site, animal welfare campaigners said on Tuesday. International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) said it had conducted a survey in Britain, Australia, China, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Canada and the United States and tracked more than 2,200 elephant ivory items listed on eBay websites. It found more than 90 percent of the listings breached even eBay&#39;s own wildlife policies. International wildlife trade laws differ from country to country and are often complex, but according to the IFAW in general it is illegal to sell carved or uncarved ivory unless it is antique and accompanied by a proof of age certificate. The Fund says the only way to protect elephants from poachers is to shut down the markets where illegal ivory can easily be passed off as antique. "As the world&#39;s largest online shop window, eBay has a special responsibility to lead the way by banning ivory from their sites, said Robbie Marsland, IFAW&#39;s British director. "Only a global ban on all ivory sales will remove the cover under which this criminal activity currently operates and as a result, seriously help to decrease illegal trade and the cruel and unnecessary slaughter of elephants." Gareth Streeter, a spokesman for eBay in London, said in a statement the Web site operated policies to "restrict the sale of ivory in accordance with existing UK and international law. "We have had a number of positive and fruitful discussions with the IFAW about how we can work together to ensure that our policies are effectively enforced, and we are committed to working with them to tackle the problem of illegal ivory sales," he said. Marsland urged eBay to ban all trade in ivory. "Elephants are facing extinction, in part because of Internet ivory trade. It is time for action," he said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/usiraqmilitaryjusticehaditha US marine &#39;astonished&#39; at failure to probe Haditha killings marine &#39;astonished&#39; at failure to probe Haditha killings AM ET CAMP PENDLETON, United States (AFP) - A US Marine probing the deaths of 24 Iraqi civilians in the town of Haditha told a hearing Monday he was "astonished" it took four months to launch an investigation. Colonel John Ewers was testifying at a preliminary hearing for captain Randy Stone, who stands accused of failing to hold a proper investigation into the alleged massacre of the Iraqis by US troops on November 19, 2005. Ewers said he had been ordered to conduct an investigation into the killings by Army Major General Eldon Bargewell following the publication of a report into the deaths by Time magazine. Bargewell told Ewers to "get up there (to Haditha) and ask the hard questions" in March last year. "Three to four months had elapsed, and it didn&#39;t pop up on anybody&#39;s radar screen," Ewers said. "I remember feeling pretty astonished that no investigation had been conducted." Ewers said his priority was trying to establish why an investigation was not launched. He said Stone bore "some of the responsibility" for "thin" reporting, but said Stone had been "set up to fail." Three Marines face murder charges over the killings while four other soldiers, including Stone, stand accused of covering up the deaths, the most serious war crimes case involving US forces since the invasion of Prosecutors allege Marines went on a killing spree in Haditha, in the heart of the Sunni triangle, shooting unarmed men, women and children after a comrade was killed by a roadside bomb while on patrol. Defense lawyers have said the Marines followed established war-time rules of engagement. Initial reports of the incident by the Marines said 15 people had died in a roadside bombing. But the investigation published by Time in March contradicted the official version of events. The Haditha killings led to two separate military investigations. The first focused on the events in Haditha itself while a second looked at whether military commanders attempted a cover-up. The probe into events on the ground has found that 10 of the victims were women and children who died after being shot at close range. The investigations also discovered that five unarmed men travelling in a taxi were shot dead as they approached the scene.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/britain_ivory_ebay_dc eBay condemned for allowing "rampant" ivory trade condemned for allowing "rampant" ivory trade Mon May 14, 7:08 PM ET LONDON (Reuters) - The elephant, the world&#39;s largest land mammal, is being threatened with global extinction by a "rampant trade" in ivory on the eBay online auction site, animal welfare campaigners said on Tuesday. International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) said it had conducted a survey in Britain, Australia, China, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Canada and the United States and tracked more than 2,200 elephant ivory items listed on eBay websites. It found more than 90 percent of the listings breached even eBay&#39;s own wildlife policies. International wildlife trade laws differ from country to country and are often complex, but according to the IFAW in general it is illegal to sell carved or uncarved ivory unless it is antique and accompanied by a proof of age certificate. The Fund says the only way to protect elephants from poachers is to shut down the markets where illegal ivory can easily be passed off as antique. "As the world&#39;s largest online shop window, eBay has a special responsibility to lead the way by banning ivory from their sites, said Robbie Marsland, IFAW&#39;s British director. "Only a global ban on all ivory sales will remove the cover under which this criminal activity currently operates and as a result, seriously help to decrease illegal trade and the cruel and unnecessary slaughter of elephants." Gareth Streeter, a spokesman for eBay in London, said in a statement the Web site operated policies to "restrict the sale of ivory in accordance with existing UK and international law. "We have had a number of positive and fruitful discussions with the IFAW about how we can work together to ensure that our policies are effectively enforced, and we are committed to working with them to tackle the problem of illegal ivory sales," he said. Marsland urged eBay to ban all trade in ivory. "Elephants are facing extinction, in part because of Internet ivory trade. It is time for action," he said.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/fbi_whistleblowers FBI whistle-blowers urge new protections whistle-blowers urge new protections Mon May 14, 8:46 PM ET whistle-blowers Monday supported protection for intelligence agency employees who expose government wrongdoing. The comments by Colleen Rowley and Michael German came as 40 public-interest organizations urged Congress to include national security workers in the Whistleblower Protection Act. The act outlawing retaliation against whistle-blowers does not apply to employees of most intelligence agencies. "Freedom to warn is a key concept," Rowley said at a panel discussion on Capitol Hill. Rowley's blistering memo to the FBI director helped focus attention on the law enforcement agency's shortcomings in the run-up to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. National security whistle-blowers often find themselves sidelined, without a security clearance and without a job, the American Civil Liberties Union American Civil Liberties Union said in a report. Former FBI agent Michael German, a focus of one ACLU case study, reported serious problems in a counterterrorism investigation, a move he says prompted retaliation that led him to resign in protest. German said his accusations ultimately were found to be true because of the persistence of Sen. Charles Grassley ( ), R-Iowa, who thanked German and Rowley for providing "valuable information to me in my efforts to oversee the FBI."

"This is the first time we have detected dark matter as having a unique structure that is different from the gas and galaxies in the cluster," said James Jee, a member of NASA&#39;s team of astronomers. Astronomers have long suspected there must be some substance holding galaxy clusters together, otherwise galaxies would only have the gravity from their visible stars, which would not be enough to keep them from flying apart. Though invisible, astronomers have inferred dark matter exists by observing how its gravity bends the light of more distant background galaxies. "Although the invisible matter has been found before in other galaxy clusters, it has never been detected to be so largely separated from the hot gas and the galaxies that make up galaxy clusters," said Jee, who works at the Johns Hopkins University. "By seeing a dark matter structure that is not traced by galaxies and hot gas, we can study how it behaves differently from normal matter," he said. US astronomers said they made the discovery accidentally while mapping the distribution of dark matter within the ZwC10024+1652 cluster in August 2006. As they studied their data the astronomers noticed a ripple in the dark matter, similar to ripples created when a stone is plopped into a pond. Jee said that at first he was upset when he found the ring because he thought there was a flaw in the team&#39;s data reduction. He then found research published in 2002 suggesting that the cluster under observation had collided with another cluster one to two billion years ago. The collision occurred along Earths line of sight, and from this perspective the dark-matter structure looks like a ring. In a computer simulation of a galaxy clusters collision, dark matter first falls to the center of the combined cluster, then moves outward but begins to slow under the pull of gravity. described the phenomenon in a statement as being "like cars bunched up on a highway." "Nature is doing an experiment for us that we can&#39;t do in a lab, and it agrees with our theoretical models," said team member Holland Ford, also of Johns Hopkins University. The galaxy cluster collision "created a ripple of dark matter which left distinct footprints in the shapes of the background galaxies," said Jee. "It&#39;s like looking at the pebbles on the bottom of a pond with ripples on the surface. The pebbles&#39; shapes appear to change as the ripples pass over them," Jee said. "So, too, the background galaxies behind the ring show coherent changes in their shapes due to the presence of the dense ring."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/creditcards_congress_dc Democrats aim to rein in credit card abuses aim to rein in credit card abuses PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. Senate Democrats introduced a bill on Tuesday that would limit credit card fees and interest rate hikes that can bury consumers in debt. "I&#39;m afraid these practices have become too entrenched and too profitable to the credit card companies for the companies to change them on their own," Carl Levin ( ) of Michigan said in a statement. "Congress needs to enact pro-consumer legislation to put an end to these unfair practices." The bill, sponsored by Levin and Claire McCaskill ( ) of Missouri, calls for an end to abusive practices that can result in a downward spiral of mounting debt for some card holders. It would prohibit interest rate hikes on a credit card account unless the card holder agrees to them and would limit penalty interest rate hikes to no more than a 7 percent increase. The legislation would also ban a credit card issuer from repeatedly charging over-limit fees for a single instance of a card holder exceeding a credit card limit, and prohibit interest charges on transaction fees such as late fees and over-the-limit fees, Levin said. "Credit card companies are so profitable that they can afford to give up unfair practices," Levin said. Levin introduced the bill after holding a March hearing, where a senior executive with JPMorgan Chase & Co.&#39;s Chase Bank USA apologized to a 29-year-old Ohio man who repaid twice the amount of a &#36;3,200 bill because of interest and fees. Outstanding U.S. credit card debt total &#36;750 billion in November, according to estimates. The industry has more than 640 million credit cards in circulation. Levin said the bill would be sent to the Senate Banking Committee for consideration.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/eavesdropping White House pressed Ashcroft on wiretaps House pressed Ashcroft on wiretaps By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press WASHINGTON - A top Justice Department official thought 's no-warrant wiretapping program was so questionable that he refused for a time to reauthorize it, leading to a standoff with White House officials at the bedside of the ailing attorney general, a Senate panel was told Tuesday. Former Deputy Attorney General James Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he refused to recertify the program because Attorney General had reservations about its legality just before falling ill with pancreatitis in March 2004. The White House, Comey said, recertified the program without the Justice Department's signoff, allowing it to operate for about three weeks without concurrence on whether it was legal. Comey, Ashcroft, Director Robert Mueller and other Justice Department officials at one point considered resigning, Comey said. "I couldn't stay, if the administration was going to engage in conduct that the had said had no legal basis," Comey told the panel. A day after the March 10, 2004, incident at Ashcroft's hospital bedside, President Bush ordered changes to the program to accommodate the department's concerns. Ashcroft signed the presidential order to recertify the program about three weeks later. The dramatic hospital confrontation involved Comey, the acting attorney general during Ashcroft's absence, and a White House team that included Bush's then-counsel, Alberto Gonzales, and White House Chief of Staff Andy Card, Comey said. Gonzales later succeeded Ashcroft as attorney general. Senior government officials had expressed concerns about whether the National Security Agency, which administered the warrantless eavesdropping program, had the proper oversight in place. Other concerns included whether any president possessed the legal and constitutional authority to authorize the program as it operated at the time. Comey testified Tuesday that when he refused to certify the program, Gonzales and Card headed to Ashcroft's sick bed in the intensive care unit at George Washington University Hospital. When Gonzales appealed to Ashcroft, the ailing attorney general lifted his head off the pillow and in straightforward terms described his views of the program, Comey said. Then he pointed out that Comey, not Ashcroft, held the powers of the attorney general at that moment. Gonzales and Card then left the hospital room, Comey said. "I was angry," Comey told the panel. "I thought I had just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man who did not have the powers of the attorney general." Comey's testimony revived one of the Bush administration's most bitter internal fights just as Gonzales appeared less under siege about the firings of several U.S. attorneys last year. Bush has stood solidly by his longtime counselor's side; calls for Gonzales' resignation have waned in recent weeks. Asked about Comey's testimony, White House press secretary Tony Snow said he didn't know anything about the conversation at Ashcroft's bedside. But he defended the program. "Because he had an appendectomy, his brain didn't work?" Snow said of Ashcroft. "Jim Comey can talk about whatever reservations he may have had. But the fact is that there were strong protections in there, this program has saved lives and it's vital for national security and furthermore has been reformed in a bipartisan way." Dean Boyd, a Justice Department spokesman, said he couldn't comment on "internal discussions that may or may have not taken place concerning classified intelligence activities." But he said the program succeeded in helping detect and prevent terrorist attacks and was always subject to rigorous oversight and review. Democrats cited Comey's testimony as evidence of what they say is Gonzales' tendency to put loyalty to Bush ahead of most everything &#151; including Justice's tradition of independence from the politics of the White House. "What happened in that hospital room crystallized Mr. Gonzales' view about the rule of law: that he holds it in minimum low regard," said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Under questioning by Sen. Arlen Specter ( ), R-Pa., Comey said he was not threatened by Vice President or other White House officials who disagreed with him on the legality of the eavesdropping program. Comey recalled that after the bedside incident he started to offer his resignation and was persuaded to wait a few days until Ashcroft could resign with him. "Mr. Ashcroft's chief of staff asked me something that meant a great deal to him, and that is that I not resign until Mr. Ashcroft was well enough to resign with me," Comey said. On March 12 at their daily briefing of the president, Bush asked Comey and Mueller for separate private conversations on Justice's concerns about the eavesdropping program. There, Comey said, Bush agreed to do "the right thing." "We had the president's direction to do what we believed, what the Justice Department believed, was necessary to put this matter on a footing where we could certify to its legality," Comey said of the period after those private meetings. "We did that." Spokesmen for Ashcroft and Mueller refused requests for comment.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/cable_choice Cable customers' choices being debated customers' choices being debated By JOHN DUNBAR, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 48 minutes ago WASHINGTON - Sports fans everywhere want to know: "Why do I have to subscribe to the soap opera channel when all I really want is ESPN?" That's the kind of question the cable TV industry hates answering. The channel choice issue comes up every few years, but people who argue that subscribers should be able to choose channels "a la carte" have never made any real headway. The latest effort, and the newest reasoning for requiring cable companies to offer channel choice, or a la carte cable, has to do with yet another issue: television violence. released a report in late April suggesting to Congress that an a la carte system would allow parents to shield their children from violent shows by not subscribing to the channels that carry them. FCC Chairman Kevin Martin, who has been unshakable in his support of channel choice, says it can't happen without federal legislation. And thus far, the issue has gotten little traction on Capitol Hill. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., who is expected to unveil a bill addressing television violence any day now, has opposed the creation of an a la carte system. The overall lack of support might seem surprising, considering that the average household in 2006 received 104 channels, yet tuned in to only 16 of them, according to the Nielsen TV ratings company. If we aren't watching all those channels, why can't we just pick the ones we want and avoid paying for the rest? The answer lies within the arcane world of cable television economics. In the old days (pre-1970s), cable systems provided viewers with broadcast channels that viewers couldn't tune in because the signals were too weak where they lived. Since then, there has been a steady growth in cable-only channels, starting with popular ones such as HBO, CNN, MTV and ESPN. Federal law requires cable companies to offer a bare bones, "basic tier" of service, consisting of local broadcast and public access channels. The second tier, commonly known as "expanded basic," includes most of the major cable networks. There's usually no choice on this tier; subscribers get all the channels or none of them. Beyond that, subscribers may pick premium channels like HBO, that are priced separately. Unlike over-the-air broadcasters, which rely almost entirely on advertising to stay in business, cable networks earn about half their revenue from per-subscriber charges levied on cable system operators. Those costs are passed on to cable subscribers. Two types of companies dominate the cable industry: those that own both broadcast and cable networks (like Walt Disney Co.); and those that own both cable systems and cable networks (like Time Warner Inc.). Disney, for example, owns the ABC television network, which feeds programming to 228 affiliates, several popular cable-only channels (80 percent of ESPN) and several not-as-popular cable channels (SOAPnet). Cable customers demand that their local cable company carry the ABC affiliate so they can watch popular shows such as Desperate Housewives and Lost, or catch the local news. Disney can charge the cable operator to carry the ABC network, but the cable operator can avoid the cost by agreeing to carry other, less-popular Disney-owned networks. The second model is a form of vertical integration, or ownership of the cable delivery system as well as its programming content. Time Warner owns the second-largest cable television service in the nation with 13.4 million subscribers. It also owns some of the most popular cable channels in the United States. That means that Time Warner the cable system owner has to negotiate with Time Warner the cable channel owner to provide programming. In a nutshell, the cable television business is a closed, profitable system with a small number of very large players who negotiate secret deals with one another and have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. "The whole system feeds on itself," said Jeannine Kenney, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "It's almost like everyone benefits except for the consumer and the independent content provider." An a la carte regime would blow up that system and disrupt its economic model. And that would lead to higher prices and less programming diversity, according to the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, an industry trade group. Fewer channels would mean less advertising and fewer advertising dollars. An a la carte system would also require more customer service representatives, higher billing costs and higher marketing costs. These factors and others would ultimately lead to higher rates for consumers, according to the NCTA. The bottom line, though, is there is no way of knowing for sure. A 2003 GAO report stated that "a variety of factors" make it "difficult to ascertain how many consumers would be better off and how many would be made worse off under an a la carte approach." Consumers Union has lobbied long and hard for a la carte, saying it would put a halt to steadily rising cable prices. It has an ally in the Parents Television Council, a group that successfully pushed for higher fines for broadcast stations that air raunchy programming. The opponent is the cable industry, led by the NCTA, which issues press statements every time Martin utters the words "a la carte." Cable networks that cater to minorities are fearful of cable choice. They worry that it will drop their subscriber base dramatically and run them out of business. (The biggest minority networks, such as Black Entertainment Television, are owned by big cable or broadcast companies.) Cable's closed system has developed largely because of the industry's status as a monopoly for most of its early years. Even when direct broadcast satellite providers like Dish Network and DirecTV came on the scene and cut heavily into cable's customer base, the system still didn't change much. The same programming rules that apply to cable apply to satellite; if you want the popular channels, you have take the unpopular channels. Prior to Martin's anti-violence crusade, the most high-profile supporter of a la carte was Sen. John McCain ( ), R-Ariz. Under former FCC Chairman Michael Powell, the agency released a report that relied heavily on a cable-industry sponsored study that concluded "few consumers would experience lower bills" under an a la carte system. In early 2006, with Martin in charge, the agency released another study, the first 30 pages of which were dedicated to refuting the first study. This one concluded that "Consumers could be better off under a la carte. ..." Now the price argument has been overshadowed by the issue of content. The Parents Television Council and Martin argue that the best way to protect children from gory or tawdry programming is to give parents the option of keeping certain channels out of the lineup. Supporters say an a la carte system is more palatable constitutionally than imposing rules to restrict the airing of violent content during certain hours of the day. Thus far, Congress has yet to bite on it. Rockefeller hasn't introduced his bill, and when he does, an a la carte regime will not be part of it, according to spokeswoman Wendy Morigi. The No. 1 contributor to the senator's political campaigns over his career in federal politics, according to the Center for Responsive Politics: Time Warner. Morigi said Rockfeller doesn't create legislation based on contributions, and predicted "the cable industry will both support and oppose some of the provisions" in his bill.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/pakistan_judicial_crisis Pakistan chief justice challenges ouster chief justice challenges ouster By SADAQAT JAN, Associated Press Writer PM ET ISLAMABAD, Pakistan - Pakistan's chief justice challenged his ouster at the hands of President Gen. Pervez Musharraf before the highest court Tuesday, alleging he had been held against his will for several hours in the leader's army office. Calm returned to much of Pakistan after weekend riots in Karachi that killed 41 people and a nationwide general strike Monday, refocusing attention on Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry's legal case challenging his suspension by Musharraf two months ago. The Supreme Court is examining more than 20 petitions contesting the legality of the suspension for alleged misconduct, including one filed by Chaudhry himself. Musharraf's move has been criticized that it amounted to an attack on the independence of the judiciary as he prepares to extend his nearly eight-year rule by seeking a new presidential term this fall. With Chaudhry himself absent, his lawyer, Aitzaz Ahsan, told the 13-judge bench that the chief justice had been summoned to Musharraf's army office in Rawalpindi on March 9 and held there against his will for several hours. Ahsan said Chaudhry had been pressured to resign &#151; but did not say by whom. "He sought several times to leave. ... He was physically prevented from leaving," Ahsan said in the cavernous, marble-walled courtroom, where the public gallery was packed with reporters and lawyers. Government officials have denied the allegation that Chaudhry was held against his will. A judicial complaints panel that assembled March 9 to consider Chaudhry's case had "no authority" to prevent Chaudhry from working because it had never asked for the judge's point of view, Ahsan said. Chaudhry also accuses several of the judges on the panel of bias against him. The panel's work has been suspended while the court considers the petitions. Government lawyer Sayed Sharifuddin Pirzada told the court that when the hearing resumes Wednesday, he would show that Chaudhry's petition was flawed and premature. Meanwhile, presiding Judge Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday said the court had "taken cognizance" of the mysterious shooting death of a Supreme Court official, Syed Hammad Raza, at his Islamabad home before dawn Monday. "Each one of us was as shocked and grieved as anyone could be grieved over the matter," Ramday said. "We are watching. This court is watching," he said. Police blamed robbers for the killing, but several relatives of Raza claimed it was a targeted killing, because nothing had been stolen from the house. Ahsan said Raza &#151; who had been appointed by Chaudhry in 2005 &#151; may have been under pressure to testify against the chief justice, but he offered no evidence to support his assertion. Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz has ordered a judicial inquiry into the killing and ordered authorities to do their utmost to catch those responsible, Aziz's office said. Opponents accuse Musharraf of removing the independent-minded Chaudhry, fearing he would uphold legal challenges to the president's continued rule. Musharraf denies the move was politically motivated. To press for Chaudhry's reinstatement, lawyers have mounted a series of growing protest rallies during hearings into the case, and he has traveled around the country to seek support. An abortive visit to Karachi on Saturday by Chaudhry triggered violence between supporters and opponents of the government, which security forces made little effort to stop. That led to accusations that it was condoned by Musharraf. On Monday, an opposition call for a general strike to protest the violence paralyzed cities across Pakistan. Shops were open again Tuesday in Karachi, a port city of 15 million, and the flow of traffic on the roads appeared to be back toward normal.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/nazi_archive Sealed Nazi archives to be released Nazi archives to be released By ARTHUR MAX, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 7 minutes ago AMSTERDAM, Netherlands - Copies of documents from a secretive Nazi archive, locked away in a quiet German town for more than 50 years, will be released to Holocaust institutions within a few months under an agreement reached Tuesday. The documents will give historians an intimate view of the systematic slaughter of millions during the Holocaust, and will let survivors and victims' families search for their own histories &#151; as recorded by their tormentors. The 11-nation governing body of the International Tracing Service, which runs the archive in Bad Arolsen, Germany, voted to sidestep legal obstacles and begin distributing electronic copies of the documents to member states as soon as they are ready. The archive contains Nazi records on the arrest, transportation, incarceration, forced labor and deaths of millions of people from the year the Nazis built their first concentration camp in 1933 to the end of the war in May 1945. It also has a vast collection of postwar records from displaced persons camps. The name index refers to 17.5 million victims, and the documents fill 16 miles of shelves. Until now, the files have been used to track missing people, reunite families and validate restitution claims. The Tracing Service is an arm of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The decision to release the copies circumvents the requirement to withhold them until all 11 countries ratify 2006 treaty amendments that enabled the unsealing of the archive. It was likely to speed up the distribution of the documents by several months. Institutions that receive the documents can organize the electronic files and integrate them into their own archival systems, but they are prohibited from allowing access to researchers until the ratification process is complete, said archive director Reto Meister. 's Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, which sent a representative to the meeting, welcomed the decision. "I am delighted to see this project moving forward," said the memorial's director Avner Shalev. "This was a huge hurdle for many people" on the commission, said J. Christian Kennedy, the State Department's special envoy for Holocaust issues. He said the U.S. government would work to ensure the final four countries ratify the accord quickly. Those countries &#151; Italy, Greece, Luxembourg and France &#151; have all pledged to endorse the agreement by the fall, Meister said. The U.S., Israel, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland and Germany have already finished the legal process. Meister said the first 10 million pages &#151; about one-fifth of the documents &#151; will be ready for transfer to the countries by early September, with another huge batch following in November. The U.S., France and Germany pledged to donate more than $700,000 to offset costs for preparing and transmitting the papers, Kennedy said, just short of the amount needed. Seized by the Allies from concentration camps and Nazi offices after the war, the files were closed under a 1955 agreement to protect the privacy of survivors and the reputation of the dead who may have undergone humiliating medical experiments or been falsely accused of crimes. Few people were allowed to see the actual papers. Since 1955, the archive has received more than 11 million requests for information, but it often responded with form letters giving minimal information. Sometimes, copies of documents were given to families. Meister, a Swiss diplomat who took over as head of the Tracing Service earlier this year, said that approach is changing. "People have the right to see their files. It's their files. They may be written by the Gestapo. Ultimately, this is the property of the person whose name appears there. Somebody who visits us gets the original to see, to touch, to receive a copy," Meister said. Last year's amendments to the 1955 accords, reached after years of negotiations and resistance by several members, stipulated that some privacy guarantees remain. A single copy of the documents would be available for inclusion in the 11 member states' archives, but each government was expected to take into account "the sensitivity of certain information" the files may contain, the new agreement said. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and Yad Vashem in Jerusalem already have already asked for copies. France also has expressed an interest. Earlier at the meeting, delegates agreed to declassify all correspondence with the Tracing Service dating back more than 25 years. The correspondence covers requests and responses for information by individuals and governments, including requests by the U.S. for the files of former Nazis suspected of visa fraud when they immigrated.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/space/hubblerevealsghostlyringofdarkmatter Hubble Reveals Ghostly Ring of Dark Matter Reveals Ghostly Ring of Dark Matter 2 hours, 51 minutes ago Astronomers have discovered an enormous, ghostly ring of dark matter 5 billion light-years away--the most blatant evidence to date for the existence of a mysterious substance hidden throughout the universe. Dark matter makes up a vast majority of gravity-exerting mass in the universe, while only about 10 percent is matter we can see and touch. If didn&#39;t exist, scientists say, galaxies like the Milky Way would have already flown apart from a severe lack of gravitational "glue." Researchers pointed the aging but powerful toward a cluster of galaxies known as cluster ZwCl0024+1652. At first glance, the then-unknown ring looked like a ripple in a pond over the twinkling galactic cluster. "I was annoyed when I saw the ring because I thought it was an artifact," said M. James Jee of Johns Hopkins University. But it wasn&#39;t a glitch. The more Jee and others tried to remove the ring by tweaking the data, the more the ring-like anomaly stuck out like sore thumb. "It took more than a year to convince myself that the ring was real," Jee said. "I&#39;ve looked at a number of clusters and I haven&#39;t seen anything like this." Because so much dark matter resides in the ring, astronomers said, it bends the light around it to create the ripple effect--dark matter&#39;s calling card. The findings were announced at a The ring, 2.6-million light-years wide, formed when two huge clusters of galaxies slammed together in a head-on collision roughly 1 to 2 billion years ago, puffing the mysterious matter outward, the astronomers figure. If the galactic hit-and-run had occurred outside of Earth&#39;s line-of-sight, the result might look more like an oval. , the ring is the first collection of dark matter that differs greatly from the distribution of ordinary matter. In addition to using gravity maps to visualize the dark matter itself, the team also created computer simulations showing what happens when galaxy clusters collide. When the two clusters smashed together, they think, dark matter fell to the center and then sloshed outward. As it did so, gravity eventually slowed it down and condensed it into a large ring detected by astronomers. "By studying this collision, we are seeing how dark matter responds to gravity," said Holland Ford, another Johns Hopkins astronomer on the team. "Nature is doing an experiment for us that we can&#39;t do in a lab, and it agrees with our theoretical models." Finding dark matter is not easy because it doesn&#39;t shine or reflect light. So astronomers rely on gravity, which can bend the light of distant stars when enough mass is present, much like a lens distorts an image behind it. Thanks to the laws of physics, knowing how much light is bent tells astronomers how much mass is there. By mapping the gravity&#39;s "footprint," astronomers were able to create a picture of how dark matter ring is distributed in the cluster. In the image of the cluster, Jee said, "the background galaxies behind the ring show coherent changes in their shapes due to the presence of the dense ring. It&#39;s like looking at the pebbles on the bottom of a pond with ripples on the surface."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/cable_choice Cable customers' choices being debated customers' choices being debated By JOHN DUNBAR, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 48 minutes ago WASHINGTON - Sports fans everywhere want to know: "Why do I have to subscribe to the soap opera channel when all I really want is ESPN?" That's the kind of question the cable TV industry hates answering. The channel choice issue comes up every few years, but people who argue that subscribers should be able to choose channels "a la carte" have never made any real headway. The latest effort, and the newest reasoning for requiring cable companies to offer channel choice, or a la carte cable, has to do with yet another issue: television violence. released a report in late April suggesting to Congress that an a la carte system would allow parents to shield their children from violent shows by not subscribing to the channels that carry them. FCC Chairman Kevin Martin, who has been unshakable in his support of channel choice, says it can't happen without federal legislation. And thus far, the issue has gotten little traction on Capitol Hill. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., who is expected to unveil a bill addressing television violence any day now, has opposed the creation of an a la carte system. The overall lack of support might seem surprising, considering that the average household in 2006 received 104 channels, yet tuned in to only 16 of them, according to the Nielsen TV ratings company. If we aren't watching all those channels, why can't we just pick the ones we want and avoid paying for the rest? The answer lies within the arcane world of cable television economics. In the old days (pre-1970s), cable systems provided viewers with broadcast channels that viewers couldn't tune in because the signals were too weak where they lived. Since then, there has been a steady growth in cable-only channels, starting with popular ones such as HBO, CNN, MTV and ESPN. Federal law requires cable companies to offer a bare bones, "basic tier" of service, consisting of local broadcast and public access channels. The second tier, commonly known as "expanded basic," includes most of the major cable networks. There's usually no choice on this tier; subscribers get all the channels or none of them. Beyond that, subscribers may pick premium channels like HBO, that are priced separately. Unlike over-the-air broadcasters, which rely almost entirely on advertising to stay in business, cable networks earn about half their revenue from per-subscriber charges levied on cable system operators. Those costs are passed on to cable subscribers. Two types of companies dominate the cable industry: those that own both broadcast and cable networks (like Walt Disney Co.); and those that own both cable systems and cable networks (like Time Warner Inc.). Disney, for example, owns the ABC television network, which feeds programming to 228 affiliates, several popular cable-only channels (80 percent of ESPN) and several not-as-popular cable channels (SOAPnet). Cable customers demand that their local cable company carry the ABC affiliate so they can watch popular shows such as Desperate Housewives and Lost, or catch the local news. Disney can charge the cable operator to carry the ABC network, but the cable operator can avoid the cost by agreeing to carry other, less-popular Disney-owned networks. The second model is a form of vertical integration, or ownership of the cable delivery system as well as its programming content. Time Warner owns the second-largest cable television service in the nation with 13.4 million subscribers. It also owns some of the most popular cable channels in the United States. That means that Time Warner the cable system owner has to negotiate with Time Warner the cable channel owner to provide programming. In a nutshell, the cable television business is a closed, profitable system with a small number of very large players who negotiate secret deals with one another and have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. "The whole system feeds on itself," said Jeannine Kenney, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "It's almost like everyone benefits except for the consumer and the independent content provider." An a la carte regime would blow up that system and disrupt its economic model. And that would lead to higher prices and less programming diversity, according to the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, an industry trade group. Fewer channels would mean less advertising and fewer advertising dollars. An a la carte system would also require more customer service representatives, higher billing costs and higher marketing costs. These factors and others would ultimately lead to higher rates for consumers, according to the NCTA. The bottom line, though, is there is no way of knowing for sure. A 2003 GAO report stated that "a variety of factors" make it "difficult to ascertain how many consumers would be better off and how many would be made worse off under an a la carte approach." Consumers Union has lobbied long and hard for a la carte, saying it would put a halt to steadily rising cable prices. It has an ally in the Parents Television Council, a group that successfully pushed for higher fines for broadcast stations that air raunchy programming. The opponent is the cable industry, led by the NCTA, which issues press statements every time Martin utters the words "a la carte." Cable networks that cater to minorities are fearful of cable choice. They worry that it will drop their subscriber base dramatically and run them out of business. (The biggest minority networks, such as Black Entertainment Television, are owned by big cable or broadcast companies.) Cable's closed system has developed largely because of the industry's status as a monopoly for most of its early years. Even when direct broadcast satellite providers like Dish Network and DirecTV came on the scene and cut heavily into cable's customer base, the system still didn't change much. The same programming rules that apply to cable apply to satellite; if you want the popular channels, you have take the unpopular channels. Prior to Martin's anti-violence crusade, the most high-profile supporter of a la carte was Sen. John McCain ( ), R-Ariz. Under former FCC Chairman Michael Powell, the agency released a report that relied heavily on a cable-industry sponsored study that concluded "few consumers would experience lower bills" under an a la carte system. In early 2006, with Martin in charge, the agency released another study, the first 30 pages of which were dedicated to refuting the first study. This one concluded that "Consumers could be better off under a la carte. ..." Now the price argument has been overshadowed by the issue of content. The Parents Television Council and Martin argue that the best way to protect children from gory or tawdry programming is to give parents the option of keeping certain channels out of the lineup. Supporters say an a la carte system is more palatable constitutionally than imposing rules to restrict the airing of violent content during certain hours of the day. Thus far, Congress has yet to bite on it. Rockefeller hasn't introduced his bill, and when he does, an a la carte regime will not be part of it, according to spokeswoman Wendy Morigi. The No. 1 contributor to the senator's political campaigns over his career in federal politics, according to the Center for Responsive Politics: Time Warner. Morigi said Rockfeller doesn't create legislation based on contributions, and predicted "the cable industry will both support and oppose some of the provisions" in his bill.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/guantanamo_detainees Judges focus on Guantanamo Bay tribunals focus on Guantanamo Bay tribunals By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 16 minutes ago WASHINGTON - Two federal appeals court judges subjected a Bush administration attorney to intense questioning Tuesday as lawyers for prisoners at Guantanamo Bay pleaded for a broad court inquiry on behalf of the detainees. Judges Judith Rogers and Douglas Ginsburg expressed skepticism about government assurances that the appeals court will receive all necessary evidence in evaluating the detainees' status as enemy combatants. "I don't see how there can be any meaningful review if we don't know what we don't know," Ginsburg told a government attorney. The latest chapter in the cases of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay is about military tribunals that designated them enemy combatants, leaving them without any of the rights accorded prisoners of war. Justice Department lawyer Douglas Letter said an extensive record of classified and unclassified material on the tribunal proceedings will be supplied to the court. Congress intended for the court's review to be a narrow one, Letter emphasized. Letter said the tribunals largely duplicate long-standing procedures laid out in the Army Field Manual. "You'd better not invoke that," Rogers admonished the Justice Department lawyer. "We don't have all those" procedures here. Rogers is a Clinton appointee; Ginsburg, the chief judge of the appeals court, is a Reagan appointee; and the third member of the panel, Karen Lecraft Henderson, is an appointee of A year ago, the Republican-controlled Congress at the urging of the Bush administration stripped the prisoners of the right to challenge their indefinite detention. The only challenge detainees can make is to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, for the limited purpose of assessing the military tribunal procedures. "This is our only chance to go back to the government well," attorney Jeffrey Lang told the judges. The two cases before the appeals court involve Haji Bismullah, an Afghan, and seven men who are Uighurs, Muslims from China who are a persecuted minority in that country. They are among the 380 detainees at Guantanamo Bay, some of them held for more than five years. The detainees' attorneys want the appeals court to allow a broad inquiry questioning the accuracy and completeness of the evidence the tribunals gathered about the detainees, most of it classified. The Justice Department seeks a limited review, saying that the findings of the military tribunals are "entitled to the highest level of deference." The appeals court should not engage in fact-finding, argues the Justice Department. An attorney who heard the arguments, Shayana Kadidal of the Center for Constitutional Rights, called it "striking" that the appeals court judges expressed interest in a broader inquiry. The center has led the effort to gain access to the U.S. court system for the detainees.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/usa_military_officers_dc U.S. Army faces shortage of junior officers: memo Army faces shortage of junior officers: memo Mon May 14, 5:15 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Army, stretched thin by wars in , has only half of the senior captains it needs and will offer money and other incentives to keep those officers, according to a memo obtained by Reuters on Monday. The number of senior captains, or captains closest to promotion, stands at just 51 percent of the Army&#39;s requirements, according to a memo from Col. George Lockwood, director of officer personnel management at the Army&#39;s Human Resources Command. Lockwood said the strains of the U.S.-declared "Global War on Terror" had contributed to the shortage of officers at the rank of captain. Previous decisions to promote officers more quickly to meet targets for Army majors -- the rank above captain -- also had hurt the number of junior officers available, he said. "The Army is growing and implementing a number of programs to increase accessions, but new lieutenants will not substitute for senior captains," Lockwood wrote. "We must retain the talented officers we have developed and are seeking an aggressive overall company grade retention rate of 95 percent in all branches." Captains typically command company-sized units, or units with as many as 190 soldiers. Lockwood&#39;s memo marks the latest sign of the strain that U.S. military operations have placed on the Army -- the largest branch of the U.S. armed forces. With the Marine Corps, the Army has been most stressed by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which have taken a toll on manpower and equipment and left many units unprepared for another fight. Lockwood urged officers to encourage more junior officers to stay on active duty. According to his memo, the Army will offer &#36;20,000 bonuses and a limited number of slots for civilian graduate school, military school and language training. "If you&#39;re in a leadership position, you must scan your officer&#39;s records and identify those eligible for this program, and counsel them as soon as possible," Lockwood wrote.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/military_sites_blocked Pentagon limits troops' Web access limits troops' Web access By LOLITA C. BALDOR, Associated Press Writer Mon May 14, 8:45 PM ET WASHINGTON - Lt. Daniel Zimmerman, an infantry platoon leader in , puts a blog on the Internet every now and then "to basically keep my friends and family up to date" back home. It just got tougher to do that for Zimmerman and a lot of other U.S. soldiers. No more using the military's computer system to socialize and trade videos on MySpace, YouTube and more than a dozen others Web sites, the Citing security concerns and technological limits, the Pentagon has cut off access to those sites for personnel using the Defense Department's computer network. The change limits use of the popular outlets for service members on the front lines, who regularly post videos and journals. "I put my blog on there and my family reads it," said Zimmerman, 29, a platoon leader with B Company, 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment. "It scares the crap out of them sometimes," he said. "I keep it as vague as possible," he said. "I'm pretty responsible about it. It's just basically to tell a little bit about my life over here" he said. He's regularly at a base where he doesn't have Defense Department access to the Internet, but he has used it when he goes to bigger bases. He'll have to rely on a private account all the time now. Memos about the change went out in February, and it took effect last week. It does not affect the Internet cafes that soldiers in Iraq use that are not connected to the Defense Department's network. The cafe sites are run by a private vendor, FUBI (For US By Iraqis). Also, the Pentagon said that many of the military computers on the front lines in Iraq that are on the department's network had previously blocked the YouTube and MySpace sites. The ban also does not affect other sites, such as Yahoo, and does not prevent soldiers from sending messages and photos to their families by e-mail. Internet use has become a troublesome issue for the military as it struggles to balance security concerns with privacy rights. As blogs and video-sharing become more common, the military has voiced increasing concern about service members revealing details about military operations or other information about equipment or procedures that will aid the enemy. At the same time, service members have used the Web sites to chronicle their time in battle, posting videos and writing journals that provide a powerful, personal glimpse into their days at war. "These actions were taken to enhance and increase network security and protect the use of the bandwidth," said Col. Gary Keck, a Pentagon spokesman. The Pentagon said that use of the video sites in particular was putting a strain on the network, and also opening it to potential viruses or penetration by so-called "phishing" attacks in which scam artists try to steal sensitive data by mimicking legitimate Web sites. "The U.S. Army's not going to pay the bill for you to get on MySpace and YouTube," said Maj. Bruce Mumford, of Chester, Neb., who is serving as the brigade communications officer for the 4th Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, in Iraq. "Soldiers need to know what they can and cannot do, but we shouldn't be facilitating it." After the warnings of the shutdown went out, military members were allowed to seek waivers if the sites were necessary for their jobs. Often insurgent groups post videos, including ones of attacks or &#151; in some high profile cases &#151; of U.S. or coalition soldiers who have been captured or killed. "I guess it's a good general policy," Zimmerman said about the ban on MySpace and YouTube." If people could be trusted not to break operational security, then they wouldn't need to have the policy." If the restrictions are intended to prevent soldiers from giving or receiving bad news, they could also prevent them from providing positive reports from the field, said Noah Shachtman, who runs a national security blog for Wired Magazine. "This is as much an information war as it is bombs and bullets," he said. "And they are muzzling their best voices." Among the sites covered by the ban are the video-sharing sites YouTube, Metacafe, IFilm, StupidVideos and FileCabi; social networking sites MySpace, BlackPlanet and Hi5; music sites Pandora, MTV, 1.fm and live365, and the photo-sharing site Photobucket.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/iraq_media_ban No photos allowed after Iraqi blasts photos allowed after Iraqi blasts By KIM GAMEL, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 20 minutes ago BAGHDAD - Police fired warning shots in the air at the scene of a double bombing Tuesday, enforcing an order banning news photographers and TV camera operators from filming the aftermath of deadly bombings. The Iraqi government said it decided last weekend to keep photographers and camera crews away from blast sites to prevent them from damaging forensic evidence. Media groups feared the order was aimed at preventing scenes of horrific carnage from being broadcast around the world. The ban got its first test Tuesday, when a pair of bombs hidden in plastic bags exploded in two shops selling CDs and cigarettes in Tayaran Square in central Baghdad. Police said at least seven people were killed and 17 wounded. News photographers and cameraman rushed to the scene only to be turned away by Iraqi police, who fired warning shots in the air to disperse the crowds. Interior Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Abdul-Karim Khalaf defended the decision and said it would only last for an hour after the explosion. He said the move was not designed to curtail press freedom but to protect evidence and the privacy of the wounded. He also said the government wanted to keep insurgents from filming the scene for use in propaganda videos. "I would like to say that this is not a total ban. It is a short ban because after one hour from the explosion, journalists will have the freedom to do their work," he added, saying the ban was nationwide and would include the state-run TV station Iraqiya. Iraqi and U.S. authorities have frequently complained that the publicity surrounding car bombings and suicide attacks is jeopardizing their efforts to stop the violence, which has proven unrelenting as Sunni insurgents adopt new tactics to evade stepped-up security measures. Reporters Without Borders expressed concern about the decision, saying it "feared that growing restrictions on the media could end in a total news blackout." The international advocacy group stressed the importance of the images in providing an accurate assessment of the toll the violence is taking on Iraqi lives as well as the security situation in the capital, where movement is severely limited. "When the streets become impassable and the authorities provide no information about the attacks in real time, the role of the reporter becomes essential. Coverage of these attacks allows people to evaluate the security risk and to avoid dangerous areas," it said. Shihab al-Tamimi, the head of the Iraqi Journalists Union, said he understood the Interior Ministry's concerns. "But at the same time, the security forces should give more understanding to the work of journalists. The journalists have a job to do and they should be able to do it if it does not break a law. For example, if a photographer is after a picture at the explosion site, that does not make him a propagandist for insurgents," al-Tamimi said. Iraqi authorities often have been criticized for imposing media restrictions since the U.S.-led invasion that ousted In August 2004, the government closed the Baghdad news office of Al-Jazeera television, accusing the station of inciting violence. The office is still closed but the station operates in the Kurdish-ruled area of the north. Reporters Without Borders also noted that the Iraqi parliament voted May 9 to take legal action against Al-Jazeera over perceived insults against top Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. In December 2006, parliament also briefly banned journalists from covering its sessions.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/un_indigenous_rights U.N. panel: Indigenous people threatened panel: Indigenous people threatened By JUSTIN BERGMAN, Associated Press Writer Mon May 14, 9:43 PM ET UNITED NATIONS - Indigenous people are being pushed off their lands to make way for an expansion of biofuel crops around the world, threatening to destroy their cultures by forcing them into big cities, the head of a U.N. panel said Monday. Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, chair of the U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, said some of the native people most at risk live in Indonesia and Malaysia, which together produce 80 percent of the world's palm oil &#151; one of the crops used to make biofuels. She said there are few statistics showing how many people are at risk of losing their lands, but in one Indonesian province &#151; West Kalimantan &#151; the U.N. has identified 5 million indigenous people who will likely be displaced because of biofuel crop expansion. "The speed with which this is happening we don't really realize in our part of the world," Ida Nicolaisen, an expert in indigenous cultures and member of the U.N. forum, said at a news conference. "Because the technology we have today and the economic resources that are at stake are so big, it happens overnight." The Indonesian and Malaysian missions to the U.N. did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the remarks. Tauli-Corpuz said the forum will discuss the threat posed by biofuel crop expansion during its annual, two-week meeting in New York, which opened Monday with the blowing of a traditional bocina horn from the Andes and a ceremonial dance by a group from India. Biofuels, which are made from corn, palm oil, sugar cane and other agricultural products, have been seen by many as a cleaner and cheaper way to meet the world's soaring energy needs than with greenhouse-gas emitting fossil fuels. In its first major report on biofuels last week, however, the U.N. warned that the benefits of the alternative energy source may be offset by serious environmental problems and increased food prices for poor people in the developing world. Many biofuel crops, the report said, require the best land to grow, diverting food crops and causing prices for staples like maize and sugar to rise. They also demand large amounts of water and environment-damaging chemical fertilizers, the report said. The clearing of forests to make room for these new crops is putting at particular risk the 60 million indigenous people who depend on forests almost entirely for their survival, according to the U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. They are being forced to migrate to already overcrowded cities, where many of them end up living in slums with poor housing and limited access to services, Nicolaisen said. Tauli-Corpuz said the forum is pushing the General Assembly to pass a long-delayed declaration on indigenous rights, which she said will protect native peoples from being pushed off their lands as the demand for biofuel crops grows. The declaration states that indigenous peoples have the right to their own identity, culture and language, and to self-determination. It also says governments should respect their rights to traditional lands and resources, and that native peoples have the right to decide on any development project in their community. The U.N. Human Rights Council, based in Geneva, approved the declaration last June and recommended that the 192-member General Assembly adopt it. But the draft failed to make it out of the assembly's human rights committee in November due to opposition from African countries who argued it contradicted their national constitutions. A handful of developed nations with large native populations &#151; New Zealand, Australia and Canada &#151; also opposed the draft. The U.S. abstained on the vote, but had signed a joint statement with Australia and New Zealand last year calling the draft "fundamentally flawed." The three countries said self-determination could threaten the "territorial integrity" of U.N. member states, and the provisions on lands and resources appeared to recognize indigenous rights to lands now lawfully owned by other citizens. The African countries have been negotiating on a series of amendments to the draft, but Tauli-Corpuz urged the General Assembly to pass the original declaration during its current session, which ends in September.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/usiraqmilitaryjusticehaditha US marine &#39;astonished&#39; at failure to probe Haditha killings marine &#39;astonished&#39; at failure to probe Haditha killings AM ET CAMP PENDLETON, United States (AFP) - A US Marine probing the deaths of 24 Iraqi civilians in the town of Haditha told a hearing Monday he was "astonished" it took four months to launch an investigation. Colonel John Ewers was testifying at a preliminary hearing for captain Randy Stone, who stands accused of failing to hold a proper investigation into the alleged massacre of the Iraqis by US troops on November 19, 2005. Ewers said he had been ordered to conduct an investigation into the killings by Army Major General Eldon Bargewell following the publication of a report into the deaths by Time magazine. Bargewell told Ewers to "get up there (to Haditha) and ask the hard questions" in March last year. "Three to four months had elapsed, and it didn&#39;t pop up on anybody&#39;s radar screen," Ewers said. "I remember feeling pretty astonished that no investigation had been conducted." Ewers said his priority was trying to establish why an investigation was not launched. He said Stone bore "some of the responsibility" for "thin" reporting, but said Stone had been "set up to fail." Three Marines face murder charges over the killings while four other soldiers, including Stone, stand accused of covering up the deaths, the most serious war crimes case involving US forces since the invasion of Prosecutors allege Marines went on a killing spree in Haditha, in the heart of the Sunni triangle, shooting unarmed men, women and children after a comrade was killed by a roadside bomb while on patrol. Defense lawyers have said the Marines followed established war-time rules of engagement. Initial reports of the incident by the Marines said 15 people had died in a roadside bombing. But the investigation published by Time in March contradicted the official version of events. The Haditha killings led to two separate military investigations. The first focused on the events in Haditha itself while a second looked at whether military commanders attempted a cover-up. The probe into events on the ground has found that 10 of the victims were women and children who died after being shot at close range. The investigations also discovered that five unarmed men travelling in a taxi were shot dead as they approached the scene.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/veterans_care_bonuses VA bonus winners sat on review boards bonus winners sat on review boards By HOPE YEN, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON - Nearly two dozen officials who received hefty performance bonuses last year at the Veterans Affairs Department also sat on the boards charged with recommending the payments. Documents obtained by The Associated Press raise questions of conflict of interest in connection with the bonuses, some of which went to senior officials involved in crafting a budget that came up $1.3 billion short and jeopardized veterans' health care. The documents show that 21 of 32 officials who were members of VA performance review boards received more than half a million dollars in payments themselves. Among them: nearly a dozen senior officials who devised the flawed 2005 budget. Also rewarded was the deputy undersecretary for benefits, who manages a system with severe backlogs of veterans waiting for disability benefits. Some members of the review boards, which are appointed by VA Secretary Jim Nicholson, also had input on bonus recommendations involving themselves, fellow members and spouses that made questionable performance claims and neglected agency problems. The VA, which has defended the bonuses as necessary to retain hardworking senior employees, says board members do not participate in bonus decisions that involve themselves or fellow board members. In those cases, recommendations are made by agency heads in consultation with deputy undersecretaries who sit on the boards, the agency says. But government watchdogs were harshly critical, saying the process does little to instill public confidence in the fairness of awards. In its last known report on the issue &#151; one involving in 1980 urged that performance boards add credibility and objectivity to their decisions by including "one or more impartial members from outside the agency," although agencies are not required to do so. With the exception of a panel tasked with reviewing the VA inspector general's office, all the VA's performance board members come from within the agency. In one case, Michael Walcoff, associate deputy undersecretary for field operations who sits on two of the review boards, and his wife, Kimberly, a VA director, received a package of bonuses totaling $42,000. "This is a scandal in the making," said Paul C. Light, professor of public service at New York University who specializes in government reform. He said the VA bonuses pointed to possible "featherbedding" and other favoritism. Light said given the current problems in veterans care, the department would be best served if Nicholson restricted most performance bonuses for at least a year except in cases of clear improvement. "This is not the time for largesse for the Department of Veterans Affairs Department of Veterans Affairs ," Light said. "They must not make a link between retention and employees, but employees and performance as an incentive to solve these very serious problems." Following reports this month by the AP of the $3.8 million in bonuses, groups such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Veterans of America have called on Nicholson to explain why officials involved in budget foul-ups would be rewarded. Annual bonuses to senior VA officials last year averaged more than $16,000, the highest average in government. Rep. John Hall ( ), D-N.Y., has introduced legislation that would freeze 2007 VA bonuses for "senior politically appointed officers" &#151; such as assistant secretaries or deputy undersecretaries &#151; until the agency pares its disability claims backlog to under 100,000 cases. "It is simply unacceptable that veterans are waiting longer and longer for benefits they desperately need while senior staff members in charge of bad policy are rewarded so-called performance bonuses," Hall said. The legislation, originally scheduled for a vote Tuesday, was expected to be considered along with other veterans health care bills later this month, a spokeswoman for Hall said. Under a federal law passed in 1978 to increase government accountability by tying bonuses more closely to performance, agencies are required to appoint performance review boards yearly to guarantee bonus awards are "fair and credible." According to guidance by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, performance boards must ensure that bonuses are given based not only on individual accomplishments cited by supervisors, but also the department's overall success. However, 2006 bonus proposals obtained by the AP show that senior officials who received top payments of $33,000 were sometimes credited for achievements that were questionable, if not inaccurate. Also, no mention was made of agency-wide problems. _Rita Reed, deputy assistant secretary for budget: "Demonstrated the ability to design and implement strategies that maximize employee potential and foster high ethical standards in meeting the organization's mission and goals." While touting her role in launching programs to "leverage the VA's buying power" as well as collecting $5.1 million in erroneous payments, the proposal does not mention Reed's lead role in crafting the VA's flawed 2005 budget. Months prior to her bonus award, GAO investigators determined the VA had used misleading accounting to justify health cuts, claiming false savings in part by double-counting savings from volume purchasing in government contracts from year to year. _William Feeley, deputy undersecretary for health for operations and management: "Made numerous contributions to veterans and the Veterans Health Administration in his role as deputy undersecretary." It said he also led systemwide improvements that resulted in a 2.2 percent decrease in wait times for primary care. Feeley received a top bonus and is credited for yearlong achievements even though he did not take the job until February 2006, nearly halfway into the fiscal year. Previously, he was a VA regional director who played a role in the flawed 2005 budget. Regarding veterans' wait times to see doctors, a 2005 report from the VA inspector general found that VA schedulers routinely put the wrong requested appointment dates into the system, which made reported wait times appear shorter than they really were. The IG has said problems lingered in 2006 despite VA promises. _Ronald Aument, deputy undersecretary for benefits: "His knowledge of VBA programs and operations and his breadth of experiences across VA have contributed greatly to VBA's progress in improving services to veterans." Aument helps manage a disability claims system that has backlogs of 400,000 to 600,000 veterans. The waits average 177 days, two months short of the VA's strategic goal of 125 days to process claims. Nicholson has called the delays unacceptable. Aument also is praised in his bonus proposal for requesting needed money and resources. The VA is now moving to hire additional case managers to reduce short-staffing after problems were brought to light following disclosures of shoddy outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/usspacematter NASA says it has found proof of existence of dark matter says it has found proof of existence of dark matter 2 hours, 51 minutes ago WASHINGTON (AFP) - US astronomers on Tuesday presented the most solid proof yet of the existence of dark matter, a mysterious substance believed to make up more than a quarter of the universe. spotted a ring of dark matter in a galaxy cluster some five billion light-years away from Earth, which measured some 2.6 million light-years across. "This is the first time we have detected dark matter as having a unique structure that is different from the gas and galaxies in the cluster," said James Jee, a member of NASA&#39;s team of astronomers. Astronomers have long suspected there must be some substance holding galaxy clusters together, otherwise galaxies would only have the gravity from their visible stars, which would not be enough to keep them from flying apart. Though invisible, astronomers have inferred dark matter exists by observing how its gravity bends the light of more distant background galaxies. "Although the invisible matter has been found before in other galaxy clusters, it has never been detected to be so largely separated from the hot gas and the galaxies that make up galaxy clusters," said Jee, who works at the Johns Hopkins University. "By seeing a dark matter structure that is not traced by galaxies and hot gas, we can study how it behaves differently from normal matter," he said. US astronomers said they made the discovery accidentally while mapping the distribution of dark matter within the ZwC10024+1652 cluster in August 2006. As they studied their data the astronomers noticed a ripple in the dark matter, similar to ripples created when a stone is plopped into a pond. Jee said that at first he was upset when he found the ring because he thought there was a flaw in the team&#39;s data reduction. He then found research published in 2002 suggesting that the cluster under observation had collided with another cluster one to two billion years ago. The collision occurred along Earths line of sight, and from this perspective the dark-matter structure looks like a ring. In a computer simulation of a galaxy clusters collision, dark matter first falls to the center of the combined cluster, then moves outward but begins to slow under the pull of gravity. described the phenomenon in a statement as being "like cars bunched up on a highway." "Nature is doing an experiment for us that we can&#39;t do in a lab, and it agrees with our theoretical models," said team member Holland Ford, also of Johns Hopkins University. The galaxy cluster collision "created a ripple of dark matter which left distinct footprints in the shapes of the background galaxies," said Jee. "It&#39;s like looking at the pebbles on the bottom of a pond with ripples on the surface. The pebbles&#39; shapes appear to change as the ripples pass over them," Jee said. "So, too, the background galaxies behind the ring show coherent changes in their shapes due to the presence of the dense ring."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/fort_drum_missing_soldiers Missing soldiers from Fort Drum soldiers from Fort Drum FORT DRUM, N.Y. - The seven American victims of a weekend ambush in were members of the storied 10th Mountain Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Army officials in Iraq said Tuesday. The attack near Mahmoudiya, in a Sunni stronghold 20 miles south of Baghdad, left four U.S. soldiers and an Iraqi translator dead, and three other soldiers missing. acknowledged for the first time that it believes the missing soldiers are in terrorist hands. The Islamic State of Iraq &#151; an al-Qaida front group that has claimed to have captured the soldiers &#151; has warned the U.S. to stop its massive search for the missing. Military officials would not release the names of the soldiers until their families were notified but confirmed they were assigned to Company D, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, nicknamed the "Polar Bears," said Lt. Col. Paul Fitzpatrick, a Fort Drum spokesman. All the missing soldiers are men, Fitzpatrick said. "It's been the unfortunate experience that soldiers who have been captured have not all turned out well. We are hoping this turns out to be an exception," he said. The 10th Mountain Division has a reputation for success that dates to World War II. Ready to go anywhere in the world within 48 hours, the 10th Mountain is trained to fight in steamy jungles, sandy deserts, cities and, of course, mountains. Families of the soldiers released the names of two of the dead on Monday &#151; Sgt. 1st Class James David Connell Jr., 40, of Lake City, Tenn., and Pfc. Daniel Courneya, 19, of Vermontville, Mich. Connell's family learned of his death Saturday afternoon, they said. The soldier had just recovered from a shrapnel wound to the leg and had visited his family on leave this month. The family is now planning a memorial service in Lake City and a burial at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his brother, Jeff Connell. "I'm proud of my dad, because he didn't really fight for himself, he fought for the country," Connell's teenage daughter, Courtney, told Knoxville's WATE-TV. In Michigan, students at Maple Valley High School created a memorial for Courneya, who graduated in 2005 and was well-known in the small community southwest of Lansing. He was a member of the school's track and soccer teams and played clarinet in the band. "It's a tribute of photos, posters, plaques and a picture of him in his uniform," school official Kelly Zank told The Associated Press on Tuesday. His death was announced Monday over the school's public address system, and a moment of silence was observed, she said. Courneya's mother, Wendy Thompson, said his wife, Jennifer, called family members Saturday night to tell them he had been killed. Thompson said her husband, Army Spc. David Thompson, was in Iraq and returning home after learning of his stepson's death. If all three soldiers now missing were taken alive, it would be the biggest single abduction of U.S. soldiers in Iraq since March 23, 2003, when Pvt. Jessica Lynch and six others were captured in an ambush near Nasiriyah that also left 11 Americans dead. The 2nd Brigade Combat Team is in the 10th month of a 15-month tour in Iraq. The brigade was also deployed to Iraq in 2005. The 10th Mountain Division made its reputation in World War II, when soldiers scaled a sheer, 1,500-foot cliff under cover of darkness and fought their way through the snowy mountains of northern Italy in 1945. That spearheaded the drive that would liberate the country from the Nazis. The 10th Mountain was the Army's most frequently deployed division during the 1990s, serving in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere. The division's members became the first regular U.S. ground troops to be sent to Central Asia as part of American's response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Its soldiers provided security for U.S. Air Force fighter and combat search-and-rescue teams in Uzbekistan.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/un_indigenous_rights U.N. panel: Indigenous people threatened panel: Indigenous people threatened By JUSTIN BERGMAN, Associated Press Writer Mon May 14, 9:43 PM ET UNITED NATIONS - Indigenous people are being pushed off their lands to make way for an expansion of biofuel crops around the world, threatening to destroy their cultures by forcing them into big cities, the head of a U.N. panel said Monday. Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, chair of the U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, said some of the native people most at risk live in Indonesia and Malaysia, which together produce 80 percent of the world's palm oil &#151; one of the crops used to make biofuels. She said there are few statistics showing how many people are at risk of losing their lands, but in one Indonesian province &#151; West Kalimantan &#151; the U.N. has identified 5 million indigenous people who will likely be displaced because of biofuel crop expansion. "The speed with which this is happening we don't really realize in our part of the world," Ida Nicolaisen, an expert in indigenous cultures and member of the U.N. forum, said at a news conference. "Because the technology we have today and the economic resources that are at stake are so big, it happens overnight." The Indonesian and Malaysian missions to the U.N. did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the remarks. Tauli-Corpuz said the forum will discuss the threat posed by biofuel crop expansion during its annual, two-week meeting in New York, which opened Monday with the blowing of a traditional bocina horn from the Andes and a ceremonial dance by a group from India. Biofuels, which are made from corn, palm oil, sugar cane and other agricultural products, have been seen by many as a cleaner and cheaper way to meet the world's soaring energy needs than with greenhouse-gas emitting fossil fuels. In its first major report on biofuels last week, however, the U.N. warned that the benefits of the alternative energy source may be offset by serious environmental problems and increased food prices for poor people in the developing world. Many biofuel crops, the report said, require the best land to grow, diverting food crops and causing prices for staples like maize and sugar to rise. They also demand large amounts of water and environment-damaging chemical fertilizers, the report said. The clearing of forests to make room for these new crops is putting at particular risk the 60 million indigenous people who depend on forests almost entirely for their survival, according to the U.N. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. They are being forced to migrate to already overcrowded cities, where many of them end up living in slums with poor housing and limited access to services, Nicolaisen said. Tauli-Corpuz said the forum is pushing the General Assembly to pass a long-delayed declaration on indigenous rights, which she said will protect native peoples from being pushed off their lands as the demand for biofuel crops grows. The declaration states that indigenous peoples have the right to their own identity, culture and language, and to self-determination. It also says governments should respect their rights to traditional lands and resources, and that native peoples have the right to decide on any development project in their community. The U.N. Human Rights Council, based in Geneva, approved the declaration last June and recommended that the 192-member General Assembly adopt it. But the draft failed to make it out of the assembly's human rights committee in November due to opposition from African countries who argued it contradicted their national constitutions. A handful of developed nations with large native populations &#151; New Zealand, Australia and Canada &#151; also opposed the draft. The U.S. abstained on the vote, but had signed a joint statement with Australia and New Zealand last year calling the draft "fundamentally flawed." The three countries said self-determination could threaten the "territorial integrity" of U.N. member states, and the provisions on lands and resources appeared to recognize indigenous rights to lands now lawfully owned by other citizens. The African countries have been negotiating on a series of amendments to the draft, but Tauli-Corpuz urged the General Assembly to pass the original declaration during its current session, which ends in September.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/ushealthgovernmentpolitics US health system ranks last compared to other countries: studies health system ranks last compared to other countries: studies AM ET WASHINGTON (AFP) - The US health care system ranks last among other major rich countries for quality, access and efficiency, according to two studies released Tuesday by a health care think tank. The studies by the Commonwealth Fund found that the United States, which has the most expensive health system in the world, underperforms consistently relative to other countries and differs most notably in the fact that Americans have no universal health insurance coverage. "The United States stands out as the only nation in these studies that does not ensure access to health care through universal coverage and promotion of a &#39;medical home&#39; for patients," said Commonwealth Fund president Karen Davis. "Our failure to ensure health insurance for all and encourage stable, long-term ties between physicians and patients shows in our poor performance on measures of quality, access, efficiency, equity, and health outcomes." In "Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: An International Update on the Comparative Performance of American Health Care", the study focused on interviews with physicians and patients in Australia, Britain, Canada, Germany, New Zealand and the United States who were asked to speak about their experiences and views on their health systems. The US ranked last in most areas, including access to health care, patient safety, timeliness of care, efficiency and equity. Americans were also last in terms of whether they had a regular physician. "The US spends twice what the average industrialized country spends on health care but we&#39;re clearly not getting value for the money," Davis told AFP. She also noted that 45 million Americans, or 15 percent of the US population, have no health insurance, which contributes to the country&#39;s medical woes. The United States is also far behind in adopting modern health information technology, which translates into spiralling costs and poor care. "We pride ourselves on being advanced on so many areas of technology but it&#39;s not the case on health information technology," Davis said. "Other countries have just moved ahead." Britain got the top score in overall ranking among the countries in the study, followed by Germany. New Zealand and Australia tied for third followed by Canada and the United States. The second study delves into why health costs in the United States are so much higher than in eight other countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development: Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and New Zealand. The study, "Multinational Comparisons of Health Systems Data," found that even though the US spends the most on publicly and privately financed health insurance, its citizens had the most potential years of life lost due to circulatory and respiratory diseases as well as diabetes. "This study blows a lot of myths about the US health system," Davis said. "We spend three times what the average country spends on a day of hospital care and we also spend twice what the average country spends on prescription medication." Health care is likely to be a prominent issue in the 2008 US presidential elections with various candidates already promising to tackle rising costs and the burden placed on big business to provide health insurance.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/space/hubblerevealsghostlyringofdarkmatter Hubble Reveals Ghostly Ring of Dark Matter Reveals Ghostly Ring of Dark Matter 2 hours, 52 minutes ago Astronomers have discovered an enormous, ghostly ring of dark matter 5 billion light-years away--the most blatant evidence to date for the existence of a mysterious substance hidden throughout the universe. Dark matter makes up a vast majority of gravity-exerting mass in the universe, while only about 10 percent is matter we can see and touch. If didn&#39;t exist, scientists say, galaxies like the Milky Way would have already flown apart from a severe lack of gravitational "glue." Researchers pointed the aging but powerful toward a cluster of galaxies known as cluster ZwCl0024+1652. At first glance, the then-unknown ring looked like a ripple in a pond over the twinkling galactic cluster. "I was annoyed when I saw the ring because I thought it was an artifact," said M. James Jee of Johns Hopkins University. But it wasn&#39;t a glitch. The more Jee and others tried to remove the ring by tweaking the data, the more the ring-like anomaly stuck out like sore thumb. "It took more than a year to convince myself that the ring was real," Jee said. "I&#39;ve looked at a number of clusters and I haven&#39;t seen anything like this." Because so much dark matter resides in the ring, astronomers said, it bends the light around it to create the ripple effect--dark matter&#39;s calling card. The findings were announced at a The ring, 2.6-million light-years wide, formed when two huge clusters of galaxies slammed together in a head-on collision roughly 1 to 2 billion years ago, puffing the mysterious matter outward, the astronomers figure. If the galactic hit-and-run had occurred outside of Earth&#39;s line-of-sight, the result might look more like an oval. , the ring is the first collection of dark matter that differs greatly from the distribution of ordinary matter. In addition to using gravity maps to visualize the dark matter itself, the team also created computer simulations showing what happens when galaxy clusters collide. When the two clusters smashed together, they think, dark matter fell to the center and then sloshed outward. As it did so, gravity eventually slowed it down and condensed it into a large ring detected by astronomers. "By studying this collision, we are seeing how dark matter responds to gravity," said Holland Ford, another Johns Hopkins astronomer on the team. "Nature is doing an experiment for us that we can&#39;t do in a lab, and it agrees with our theoretical models." Finding dark matter is not easy because it doesn&#39;t shine or reflect light. So astronomers rely on gravity, which can bend the light of distant stars when enough mass is present, much like a lens distorts an image behind it. Thanks to the laws of physics, knowing how much light is bent tells astronomers how much mass is there. By mapping the gravity&#39;s "footprint," astronomers were able to create a picture of how dark matter ring is distributed in the cluster. In the image of the cluster, Jee said, "the background galaxies behind the ring show coherent changes in their shapes due to the presence of the dense ring. It&#39;s like looking at the pebbles on the bottom of a pond with ripples on the surface."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/usjusticepolitics US attorneys scandal deepens with key resignation attorneys scandal deepens with key resignation AM ET WASHINGTON (AFP) - The resignation of US Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez&#39;s right-hand man has invigorated Democrats who want to see more heads roll in a deepening scandal over the sacking of federal prosecutors. Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty, a key Republican operative and ally of President George W. Bush President George W. Bush , on Monday became the fourth official to resign over the firings. The affair has sparked anger among Democrats, who say the nine attorneys were sacked for refusing to bow to political pressure to follow up legal cases which would benefit Bush&#39;s Republican party. McNulty, the second ranking official in the US , said he planned to step down for personal reasons, likely this summer, once a replacement is found. In a letter to Gonzales, McNulty, 49, said he was leaving because "the financial realities of college-age children and two decades of public service lead me to a long overdue transition in my career." McNulty played a key role in the Justice Department because he oversaw the office that managed US attorneys, and also dealt with department policy issues and efforts against corporate fraud. Despite McNulty&#39;s high rank, he was not believed to have been closely involved with the decision to fire the eight attorneys. "McNulty&#39;s resignation is a sign that top-level administration at the Justice Department may be crumbling under the pressure of ongoing revelations, and what is yet to be disclosed," Chairman John Conyers ( ) was quoted as saying by the Washington Post. "With this news and as we press on with our investigation, we look forward to his cooperation." Democratic Senator Charles Schumer ( ) also renewed his call for Gonzales to face consequences. "This administration owes us a lot better," Schumer said, calling it "ironic" that McNulty had to go while Gonzales remained in charge. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel ( ) said Democrats "will continue our aggressive investigation into this serious matter," and added: "Resignations are no substitute for the truth." Most of the attorneys were sacked in one fell swoop last December, ostensibly for poor performance. Gonzales has admitted to mistakes in his handling of the issue but insisted no moves were made for political gain. According to media reports, McNulty had grown distant from Gonzalez in recent months, and angered his boss by his February testimony to Congress in which he linked White House political officials to the firings. McNulty testified that one of the fired prosecutors, Bud Cummins of Arkansas, had done nothing wrong but was dismissed to make room for a protege of White House senior advisor Karl Rove. After McNulty&#39;s announcement that he planned to leave his post, Gonzales issued a written statement in which he did not mention the scandal over the firings but praised McNulty&#39;s record. "The Department of Justice will be losing a dynamic and thoughtful leader with the departure of Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty," Gonzales said in a statement. He added that McNulty had been instrumental in efforts against corporate fraud and had made "significant contributions to establishing the rule of law in In his earlier position as a US attorney in Virginia, McNulty prosecuted key cases linked to the US war on terror, including those of John Walker Lindh, Ahmed Omar Abu Ali and Zacarias Moussaoui.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/iraq_media_ban No photos allowed after Iraqi blasts photos allowed after Iraqi blasts By KIM GAMEL, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 21 minutes ago BAGHDAD - Police fired warning shots in the air at the scene of a double bombing Tuesday, enforcing an order banning news photographers and TV camera operators from filming the aftermath of deadly bombings. The Iraqi government said it decided last weekend to keep photographers and camera crews away from blast sites to prevent them from damaging forensic evidence. Media groups feared the order was aimed at preventing scenes of horrific carnage from being broadcast around the world. The ban got its first test Tuesday, when a pair of bombs hidden in plastic bags exploded in two shops selling CDs and cigarettes in Tayaran Square in central Baghdad. Police said at least seven people were killed and 17 wounded. News photographers and cameraman rushed to the scene only to be turned away by Iraqi police, who fired warning shots in the air to disperse the crowds. Interior Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Abdul-Karim Khalaf defended the decision and said it would only last for an hour after the explosion. He said the move was not designed to curtail press freedom but to protect evidence and the privacy of the wounded. He also said the government wanted to keep insurgents from filming the scene for use in propaganda videos. "I would like to say that this is not a total ban. It is a short ban because after one hour from the explosion, journalists will have the freedom to do their work," he added, saying the ban was nationwide and would include the state-run TV station Iraqiya. Iraqi and U.S. authorities have frequently complained that the publicity surrounding car bombings and suicide attacks is jeopardizing their efforts to stop the violence, which has proven unrelenting as Sunni insurgents adopt new tactics to evade stepped-up security measures. Reporters Without Borders expressed concern about the decision, saying it "feared that growing restrictions on the media could end in a total news blackout." The international advocacy group stressed the importance of the images in providing an accurate assessment of the toll the violence is taking on Iraqi lives as well as the security situation in the capital, where movement is severely limited. "When the streets become impassable and the authorities provide no information about the attacks in real time, the role of the reporter becomes essential. Coverage of these attacks allows people to evaluate the security risk and to avoid dangerous areas," it said. Shihab al-Tamimi, the head of the Iraqi Journalists Union, said he understood the Interior Ministry's concerns. "But at the same time, the security forces should give more understanding to the work of journalists. The journalists have a job to do and they should be able to do it if it does not break a law. For example, if a photographer is after a picture at the explosion site, that does not make him a propagandist for insurgents," al-Tamimi said. Iraqi authorities often have been criticized for imposing media restrictions since the U.S.-led invasion that ousted In August 2004, the government closed the Baghdad news office of Al-Jazeera television, accusing the station of inciting violence. The office is still closed but the station operates in the Kurdish-ruled area of the north. Reporters Without Borders also noted that the Iraqi parliament voted May 9 to take legal action against Al-Jazeera over perceived insults against top Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. In December 2006, parliament also briefly banned journalists from covering its sessions. Earlier this month, Freedom House, a nonprofit organization that describes itself as a "clear voice for democracy and freedom around the world," cited the Iraqi government for retaining repressive laws from Saddam's era and for the detentions of journalists without charge.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/csm/orockstar Rock star prods Rio&#39;s residents to stand up to the violence star prods Rio&#39;s residents to stand up to the violence By Andrew Downie, Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor AM ET RIO DE JANEIRO - Rock stars are often angry young men and Tico Santa Cruz is no exception. But the tattooed lead singer of the hit Brazilian band Detonautas has plenty to be angry about. His hometown of Rio de Janeiro is a city under siege, with more than 6,000 homicides each year. Drug factions fight for control of the shantytowns that dot the city. Stray bullets from their firefights strike down two innocent people every three days. What ticks off Mr. Santa Cruz the most is that so few people seem to care. So he now channels his frustration into rousing Brazilians from their apathy with highly visible, creative forms of protest. Of course, he&#39;s not the first celebrity to use his star power for a good cause. But he is one of the first to galvanize victims&#39; families to confront Brazil&#39;s growing scourge of violence. "There are no popular protests here, nothing starts from the ground up. It&#39;s like everyone is waiting for someone to guide them," says Santa Cruz. "I don&#39;t see myself as a leader but as an organizer, someone who can bring together people behind an idea. Lots of people have a common purpose but just don&#39;t know how to get there, and I help them focus on that." Few people would argue that violence is the one fear that unites residents of Rio de Janeiro today. Carjackings, muggings, home invasions, and now stray bullets have changed the city irrevocably over the last few years. Seventeen people died each day from homicides last year, according to government figures. Rousing an apathetic public But Cariocas, as the citizens of the self-proclaimed Marvelous City are known, have been strangely placid. Perhaps believing the notoriously corrupt police force is beyond redemption and conscious that political pressure is largely ineffective, there have been few protests. But now, as the number of barbaric acts of violence rises, angry citizens are finding new ways to demand justice and more often than not, Santa Cruz is involved. Last month, in front of the Rio State Assembly, he had people dress as ghosts to symbolize phantom justice, policing and legislation. In another, he organized bodies to lie out as if dead in front of the city&#39;s court building. And before that, he lent his support to an nongovernmental organization that planted 1,300 roses on Copacabana beach, one for each person killed in the state this year. Tall, with arms covered in tattoos and small hoops through a pierced lip and eyebrow, the 29-something rocker is a physically striking man. He has a faint yet evident charisma and speaks with a steely integrity that makes him an effective communicator, especially when engaging the young fans of his band, one that is popular enough in Brazil to have opened shows for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The son of an engineer who lost everything and saw his family evicted from their home when he was 15, Santa Cruz has firsthand experience of life&#39;s reverses. He was already trying to rouse Rio&#39;s notoriously depoliticized youth when his band mate Rodrigo Netto was shot dead in an attempted carjacking last June. But Mr. Netto&#39;s killing so angered him that he decided to devote more time to raising consciousness. Since then Santa Cruz, often with the support of his bandmates or friends who are poets, artists, and musicians, has given interviews, preached to crowds at rock concerts, and taken a road show to schools and universities. He has also helped organize Rio United Against Violence, an informal umbrella group of victims and human rights organizations whose figureheads are all people whose tragedy has marked the city in recent months. Those victims have responded to his crusade, and even though he is half the age of some of them they see him as a leader. The movement has no formal leaders and it is not dependent on Santa Cruz, but his ability to attract media attention make its protests more newsworthy and his fellow campaigners say his involvement is crucial in publicizing their plight. "I am not sure he wants this role, but he is intelligent and articulate and he has taken on a very important task," says Lenin Novaes, a journalist whose son was killed by a stray bullet in April and who has worked with Santa Cruz to organize protests and debates. "He is one of those leaders who doesn&#39;t compromise but rather looks to mobilize people. At protests and marches against violence people listen to him and not because he is a musician but because he has something to say." The problem for Santa Cruz is that Novaes, and most of the other active members of Rio United Against Violence, are people whose lives have already been marked by tragedy. As usual, Brazil&#39;s masses have shied away from outright confrontation, preferring to live with the despair rather than confront it. Santa Cruz has worked hard to take his message to new audiences &#8211; to the housewives watching on daytime TV, for example, or to teenage music fans. And he has gained valuable media attention for his campaign. But it has so far had no noticeable effect. If the people at home are watching or listening they have so far shown little desire to act. "I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth protesting," says Leda Bunde, a perplexed retired teacher&#39;s assistant who watched the ghosts protests in front of Rio&#39;s state assembly. "You have to wait for the government to wake up one day and see what&#39;s going on." Santa Cruz is conscious of such apathy and knows this is one crowd he needs to win over. And with a steely resolution, he vows to continue objecting, demanding, instigating. There is, he says, no other option. For him or for Rio. "I don&#39;t think that everyone needs to lose someone to violence to realize what is going on, but it&#39;s getting that way," he says. "When I started I felt really frustrated that no one paid any attention. But I don&#39;t think that I am going to change things overnight. I think I am planting a seed. Do your bit today because you don&#39;t know what will happen tomorrow. It&#39;s up to you."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/pesticides_schools AP: Children face exposure to pesticides Children face exposure to pesticides By GARANCE BURKE, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 21 minutes ago STRATHMORE, Calif. - On Grandparents Day, Domitila Lemus accompanied her 8-year-old granddaughter to school. As the girls lined up behind Sunnyside Union Elementary, a foul mist drifted onto the playground from the adjacent orange groves, witnesses say. Lemus started coughing, and two children collapsed in spasms, vomiting on the blacktop. She and the little girls have since recovered without apparent lasting effects. But an Associated Press investigation has found that over the past decade, hundreds, possibly thousands, of schoolchildren in California and other agricultural states have been exposed to farm chemicals linked to sickness, brain damage and birth defects. The family of at least one California teenager suspects pesticides caused her death. There are no federal laws specifically against spraying near schools, and advocates say California and the seven other states that have laws or policies creating buffer zones around schools to protect them from pesticides don't do enough to enforce them. "The regulations are inadequate. In the vast majority of cases, people who didn't follow the laws received at best a $400 fine," said Margaret Reeves, a scientist with the Pesticide Action Network, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco. The pesticide industry says it is committed to safety, and regulators say they are doing their best to enforce the laws. "Everyone wants to protect children," said California Department of Pesticide Regulation spokesman Glenn Brank. He said his agency is doing what it can to enforce the law with a shortage of agricultural inspectors. In the Strathmore incident last November, grandparents said the spraying was being done less than 150 feet from the children. Tulare County authorities fined an unlicensed pest removal company $1,100 for spraying a restricted weed killer that morning. But no action was taken over what witnesses said happened to the children. Because no one reported the incident as a case of pesticide drift, county agricultural inspectors never swabbed the jungle gym or took grass samples, making it impossible to establish whether pesticide had, in fact, drifted onto the playground. does not keep comprehensive national figures on students and teachers sickened by drifting pesticide. In California, the No. 1 farm state and the one with the best records, there were 590 pesticide-related illnesses at schools from 1996 to 2005, according to figures given to the AP by the state. More than a third of those were due to pesticide drift, the figures show. Activists say that those numbers are low and that many cases are never even reported. In California's long, flat interior, spraying season lasts seven months, from March through September. When citrus trees blossom and grapevines climb trellises, Lemus prays to the Virgin Mary that her granddaughter won't come home with her eyes watering and head pounding, unable to breathe. Tulare County, where she lives, is one of the nation's most fertile farm regions, with more than half the schools within a quarter-mile of agricultural fields, according to the nonprofit Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment. As suburbs push close to farmland, the rate of pesticide poisoning among children nationwide has risen in recent years, according to a 2005 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association Journal of the American Medical Association . The study found that 40 percent of all children sickened by pesticides at school were victims of drift &#151; pesticide carried on the breeze. Research on pregnant women exposed to common pesticides has suggested higher rates of premature birth, and poor neurological development and smaller head circumferences among their babies. The effects on children of small, repeated exposures over a long period of time are unclear, said University of California, Berkeley epidemiologist Brenda Eskenazi. But acute pesticide poisoning can cause nausea, blurred vision, an abnormally fast heart rate, paralysis and death. Chrissy Garavito, a 15-year-old high school sophomore, died in Fontana in 1997 of a heart rhythm disturbance her mother believes was triggered by exposure to chemicals sprayed at the school. Authorities never confirmed that pesticides contributed to her death. In 2001, pesticide poisoning nearly killed Elena Dominguez, then a sixth-grader in Wenatchee, Wash. One day, after playing Frisbee during gym class across the street from an apple orchard, she passed out at her desk. "She was in a stupor," said her mother, Cindy Dominguez. "She couldn't talk, her eyes were rolling back in her head." Emergency room doctors dismissed Elena's abnormally fast heart rate as a symptom of dehydration, gave her intravenous fluids and sent her home. Three weeks later, it happened again. "I was at a track meet and all of a sudden I felt really, really tired," said Elena, now 18. "I made it to the finish line and just fell over." Investigators found her clothes were soaked in the pesticide Endosulfan I; it had been picked up from residue on the grass and absorbed into her bloodstream through her skin. Officials later found five other pesticides on school grounds and fined the apple grower for forging his applicator's license. The Dominguez family sued the orchard owner and the Wenatchee school district, which established rules requiring students to stay inside after a spraying, among other things. State officials believe it is the only district in Washington with such limitations. But keeping students inside may not be enough. Two years ago, 600 students and staff members were evacuated from an Edinburg, Texas, elementary school after pesticides drifted from a cotton field into the school's air conditioning system. Thirty-nine people developed nausea and headaches. EPA officials say they have no real idea how often pesticides waft onto school grounds. The EPA must register pesticides before they are sold, but federal law does not restrict where they can be sprayed. "We implement the laws that Congress gives us," said Ruth Allen, an EPA epidemiologist. Once the EPA approves a product, federal law requires manufacturers to report any "unreasonable adverse effects on the environment of the pesticide" that their products cause. Activists say industry is essentially allowed to police itself. CropLife America, a national organization representing suppliers of farm pesticides, said their use near schools is well-regulated. "We're really committed to public safety," said spokeswoman Donna Uchida. "Any kind of use of a pesticide has a labeling requirement that is imposed to protect human health and the environment." California has some of the strictest pesticide laws in the nation. Under state law, growers and pest control companies can be fined if pesticide drifts from a field and sickens people. A 2002 state law allows county authorities to establish a no-spray buffer zone of a quarter-mile around schools. But Tulare County has not done so. State officials said they did not know how many counties have set up such buffer zones. Lemus and environmentalists are pushing for pesticide-free zones throughout California. "Why don't they tell us they'll spray beforehand so we can bring our children inside?" Lemus said. Students sickened when pesticides drift AP via Yahoo!

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/cable_choice Cable customers' choices being debated customers' choices being debated By JOHN DUNBAR, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON - Sports fans everywhere want to know: "Why do I have to subscribe to the soap opera channel when all I really want is ESPN?" That's the kind of question the cable TV industry hates answering. The channel choice issue comes up every few years, but people who argue that subscribers should be able to choose channels "a la carte" have never made any real headway. The latest effort, and the newest reasoning for requiring cable companies to offer channel choice, or a la carte cable, has to do with yet another issue: television violence. released a report in late April suggesting to Congress that an a la carte system would allow parents to shield their children from violent shows by not subscribing to the channels that carry them. FCC Chairman Kevin Martin, who has been unshakable in his support of channel choice, says it can't happen without federal legislation. And thus far, the issue has gotten little traction on Capitol Hill. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., who is expected to unveil a bill addressing television violence any day now, has opposed the creation of an a la carte system. The overall lack of support might seem surprising, considering that the average household in 2006 received 104 channels, yet tuned in to only 16 of them, according to the Nielsen TV ratings company. If we aren't watching all those channels, why can't we just pick the ones we want and avoid paying for the rest? The answer lies within the arcane world of cable television economics. In the old days (pre-1970s), cable systems provided viewers with broadcast channels that viewers couldn't tune in because the signals were too weak where they lived. Since then, there has been a steady growth in cable-only channels, starting with popular ones such as HBO, CNN, MTV and ESPN. Federal law requires cable companies to offer a bare bones, "basic tier" of service, consisting of local broadcast and public access channels. The second tier, commonly known as "expanded basic," includes most of the major cable networks. There's usually no choice on this tier; subscribers get all the channels or none of them. Beyond that, subscribers may pick premium channels like HBO, that are priced separately. Unlike over-the-air broadcasters, which rely almost entirely on advertising to stay in business, cable networks earn about half their revenue from per-subscriber charges levied on cable system operators. Those costs are passed on to cable subscribers. Two types of companies dominate the cable industry: those that own both broadcast and cable networks (like Walt Disney Co.); and those that own both cable systems and cable networks (like Time Warner Inc.). Disney, for example, owns the ABC television network, which feeds programming to 228 affiliates, several popular cable-only channels (80 percent of ESPN) and several not-as-popular cable channels (SOAPnet). Cable customers demand that their local cable company carry the ABC affiliate so they can watch popular shows such as Desperate Housewives and Lost, or catch the local news. Disney can charge the cable operator to carry the ABC network, but the cable operator can avoid the cost by agreeing to carry other, less-popular Disney-owned networks. The second model is a form of vertical integration, or ownership of the cable delivery system as well as its programming content. Time Warner owns the second-largest cable television service in the nation with 13.4 million subscribers. It also owns some of the most popular cable channels in the United States. That means that Time Warner the cable system owner has to negotiate with Time Warner the cable channel owner to provide programming. In a nutshell, the cable television business is a closed, profitable system with a small number of very large players who negotiate secret deals with one another and have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. "The whole system feeds on itself," said Jeannine Kenney, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "It's almost like everyone benefits except for the consumer and the independent content provider." An a la carte regime would blow up that system and disrupt its economic model. And that would lead to higher prices and less programming diversity, according to the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, an industry trade group. Fewer channels would mean less advertising and fewer advertising dollars. An a la carte system would also require more customer service representatives, higher billing costs and higher marketing costs. These factors and others would ultimately lead to higher rates for consumers, according to the NCTA. The bottom line, though, is there is no way of knowing for sure. A 2003 GAO report stated that "a variety of factors" make it "difficult to ascertain how many consumers would be better off and how many would be made worse off under an a la carte approach." Consumers Union has lobbied long and hard for a la carte, saying it would put a halt to steadily rising cable prices. It has an ally in the Parents Television Council, a group that successfully pushed for higher fines for broadcast stations that air raunchy programming. The opponent is the cable industry, led by the NCTA, which issues press statements every time Martin utters the words "a la carte." Cable networks that cater to minorities are fearful of cable choice. They worry that it will drop their subscriber base dramatically and run them out of business. (The biggest minority networks, such as Black Entertainment Television, are owned by big cable or broadcast companies.) Cable's closed system has developed largely because of the industry's status as a monopoly for most of its early years. Even when direct broadcast satellite providers like Dish Network and DirecTV came on the scene and cut heavily into cable's customer base, the system still didn't change much. The same programming rules that apply to cable apply to satellite; if you want the popular channels, you have take the unpopular channels. Prior to Martin's anti-violence crusade, the most high-profile supporter of a la carte was Sen. John McCain ( ), R-Ariz. Under former FCC Chairman Michael Powell, the agency released a report that relied heavily on a cable-industry sponsored study that concluded "few consumers would experience lower bills" under an a la carte system. In early 2006, with Martin in charge, the agency released another study, the first 30 pages of which were dedicated to refuting the first study. This one concluded that "Consumers could be better off under a la carte. ..." Now the price argument has been overshadowed by the issue of content. The Parents Television Council and Martin argue that the best way to protect children from gory or tawdry programming is to give parents the option of keeping certain channels out of the lineup. Supporters say an a la carte system is more palatable constitutionally than imposing rules to restrict the airing of violent content during certain hours of the day. Thus far, Congress has yet to bite on it. Rockefeller hasn't introduced his bill, and when he does, an a la carte regime will not be part of it, according to spokeswoman Wendy Morigi. The No. 1 contributor to the senator's political campaigns over his career in federal politics, according to the Center for Responsive Politics: Time Warner. Morigi said Rockfeller doesn't create legislation based on contributions, and predicted "the cable industry will both support and oppose some of the provisions" in his bill.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/csm/orockstar Rock star prods Rio&#39;s residents to stand up to the violence star prods Rio&#39;s residents to stand up to the violence By Andrew Downie, Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor AM ET RIO DE JANEIRO - Rock stars are often angry young men and Tico Santa Cruz is no exception. But the tattooed lead singer of the hit Brazilian band Detonautas has plenty to be angry about. His hometown of Rio de Janeiro is a city under siege, with more than 6,000 homicides each year. Drug factions fight for control of the shantytowns that dot the city. Stray bullets from their firefights strike down two innocent people every three days. What ticks off Mr. Santa Cruz the most is that so few people seem to care. So he now channels his frustration into rousing Brazilians from their apathy with highly visible, creative forms of protest. Of course, he&#39;s not the first celebrity to use his star power for a good cause. But he is one of the first to galvanize victims&#39; families to confront Brazil&#39;s growing scourge of violence. "There are no popular protests here, nothing starts from the ground up. It&#39;s like everyone is waiting for someone to guide them," says Santa Cruz. "I don&#39;t see myself as a leader but as an organizer, someone who can bring together people behind an idea. Lots of people have a common purpose but just don&#39;t know how to get there, and I help them focus on that." Few people would argue that violence is the one fear that unites residents of Rio de Janeiro today. Carjackings, muggings, home invasions, and now stray bullets have changed the city irrevocably over the last few years. Seventeen people died each day from homicides last year, according to government figures. Rousing an apathetic public But Cariocas, as the citizens of the self-proclaimed Marvelous City are known, have been strangely placid. Perhaps believing the notoriously corrupt police force is beyond redemption and conscious that political pressure is largely ineffective, there have been few protests. But now, as the number of barbaric acts of violence rises, angry citizens are finding new ways to demand justice and more often than not, Santa Cruz is involved. Last month, in front of the Rio State Assembly, he had people dress as ghosts to symbolize phantom justice, policing and legislation. In another, he organized bodies to lie out as if dead in front of the city&#39;s court building. And before that, he lent his support to an nongovernmental organization that planted 1,300 roses on Copacabana beach, one for each person killed in the state this year. Tall, with arms covered in tattoos and small hoops through a pierced lip and eyebrow, the 29-something rocker is a physically striking man. He has a faint yet evident charisma and speaks with a steely integrity that makes him an effective communicator, especially when engaging the young fans of his band, one that is popular enough in Brazil to have opened shows for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The son of an engineer who lost everything and saw his family evicted from their home when he was 15, Santa Cruz has firsthand experience of life&#39;s reverses. He was already trying to rouse Rio&#39;s notoriously depoliticized youth when his band mate Rodrigo Netto was shot dead in an attempted carjacking last June. But Mr. Netto&#39;s killing so angered him that he decided to devote more time to raising consciousness. Since then Santa Cruz, often with the support of his bandmates or friends who are poets, artists, and musicians, has given interviews, preached to crowds at rock concerts, and taken a road show to schools and universities. He has also helped organize Rio United Against Violence, an informal umbrella group of victims and human rights organizations whose figureheads are all people whose tragedy has marked the city in recent months. Those victims have responded to his crusade, and even though he is half the age of some of them they see him as a leader. The movement has no formal leaders and it is not dependent on Santa Cruz, but his ability to attract media attention make its protests more newsworthy and his fellow campaigners say his involvement is crucial in publicizing their plight. "I am not sure he wants this role, but he is intelligent and articulate and he has taken on a very important task," says Lenin Novaes, a journalist whose son was killed by a stray bullet in April and who has worked with Santa Cruz to organize protests and debates. "He is one of those leaders who doesn&#39;t compromise but rather looks to mobilize people. At protests and marches against violence people listen to him and not because he is a musician but because he has something to say." The problem for Santa Cruz is that Novaes, and most of the other active members of Rio United Against Violence, are people whose lives have already been marked by tragedy. As usual, Brazil&#39;s masses have shied away from outright confrontation, preferring to live with the despair rather than confront it. Santa Cruz has worked hard to take his message to new audiences &#8211; to the housewives watching on daytime TV, for example, or to teenage music fans. And he has gained valuable media attention for his campaign. But it has so far had no noticeable effect. If the people at home are watching or listening they have so far shown little desire to act.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/books_potter_dc Rowling urges people not to ruin Potter&#39;s ending urges people not to ruin Potter&#39;s ending AM ET NEW YORK (Reuters) - Author appealed to people on Monday to leave the ending of the final book as a surprise and not spoil the mystery for fans of the best-selling series about the boy wizard. Rowling&#39;s comments were sparked by a note on April 28 on fan site, The Leaky Cauldron (www.the-leaky-cauldron.org), saying it had received "spoiler" e-mails from people claiming to know the contents of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows." "We&#39;re a little under three months away, now, and the first distant rumblings of the weirdness that usually precedes a Harry Potter publication can be heard on the horizon," Rowling wrote on her Web site wwww.jkrowling.com on Monday. "I want the readers who have, in many instances, grown up with Harry, to embark on the last adventure they will share with him without knowing where they are they going." Rowling has said two characters will die in the seventh book of the Potter series, which will be released on July 21, but she has refused to give any clues on who they will be. Speculation has been rife that Potter will be killed off by Rowling, who became the world&#39;s first billion-dollar author on the back of Potter&#39;s success. Potter books are released under tight security but The Leaky Cauldron said nuggets of information do leak out, sometimes from bookstore workers or librarians. The site said it would not post anything about possible content of the book or the fate of Harry Potter unless it came from Rowling. "And if you decide to tell us before that, you&#39;ll incur the wrath of a staff of almost 200, most of whom have been waiting almost 10 years for these final revelations and can NEVER get back the moment you rob by spoiling them," wrote the webmaster of The Leaky Cauldron, Melissa Anelli. Rowling backed Anelli&#39;s comments. "Some, perhaps, will read this and take the view that all publicity is good publicity, that spoilers are part of hype, and that I am trying to protect sales rather than my readership," she wrote. "However, spoilers won&#39;t stop people buying the book, they never have -- all it will do is diminish their pleasure in the book."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/books_potter_dc Rowling urges people not to ruin Potter&#39;s ending urges people not to ruin Potter&#39;s ending AM ET NEW YORK (Reuters) - Author appealed to people on Monday to leave the ending of the final book as a surprise and not spoil the mystery for fans of the best-selling series about the boy wizard. Rowling&#39;s comments were sparked by a note on April 28 on fan site, The Leaky Cauldron (www.the-leaky-cauldron.org), saying it had received "spoiler" e-mails from people claiming to know the contents of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows." "We&#39;re a little under three months away, now, and the first distant rumblings of the weirdness that usually precedes a Harry Potter publication can be heard on the horizon," Rowling wrote on her Web site wwww.jkrowling.com on Monday. "I want the readers who have, in many instances, grown up with Harry, to embark on the last adventure they will share with him without knowing where they are they going." Rowling has said two characters will die in the seventh book of the Potter series, which will be released on July 21, but she has refused to give any clues on who they will be. Speculation has been rife that Potter will be killed off by Rowling, who became the world&#39;s first billion-dollar author on the back of Potter&#39;s success. Potter books are released under tight security but The Leaky Cauldron said nuggets of information do leak out, sometimes from bookstore workers or librarians. The site said it would not post anything about possible content of the book or the fate of Harry Potter unless it came from Rowling. "And if you decide to tell us before that, you&#39;ll incur the wrath of a staff of almost 200, most of whom have been waiting almost 10 years for these final revelations and can NEVER get back the moment you rob by spoiling them," wrote the webmaster of The Leaky Cauldron, Melissa Anelli. Rowling backed Anelli&#39;s comments. "Some, perhaps, will read this and take the view that all publicity is good publicity, that spoilers are part of hype, and that I am trying to protect sales rather than my readership," she wrote. "However, spoilers won&#39;t stop people buying the book, they never have -- all it will do is diminish their pleasure in the book."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/healthbeat_blood_pressure Blood pressure rising around the globe pressure rising around the globe By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer AM ET WASHINGTON - The numbers are a shock: Almost 1 billion people worldwide have high blood pressure, and over half a billion more will harbor this silent killer by 2025. It's not just a problem for the ever-fattening Western world. Even in parts of Africa, high blood pressure is becoming common. That translates into millions of deaths from heart disease alone. Yet hypertension doesn't command the attention of, say, bird flu, which so far has killed fewer than 200 people. "Hypertension has gone a bit out of fashion," says Dr. Jan Ostergren of Sweden's Karolinska University Hospital, who co-authored a first-of-its-kind analysis of the global impact of high blood pressure. The idea: to rev up world governments to fight bad blood pressure just as countries have banded together in the past to fight infectious diseases. International heart specialists welcome the push. "Even in the U.S., the majority of people with high blood pressure are not treated adequately," says Dr. Sidney Smith of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who advises the World Heart Federation. "Look at China, look at Africa, go around the world. It is a major risk factor." And the dangers go well beyond the heart. High blood pressure is a leading cause of strokes and kidney failure. It also plays a role in blindness and even dementia. Patients seldom notice symptoms until organs already have been damaged. Yet treating high blood pressure before that happens is a medical best-buy. Improving diet and exercise can help. When that's not enough, blood pressure drugs are among the oldest and thus cheapest on the market &#151; 21 cents a day for a leading diuretic. Ostergren joined experts from the London School of Economics and the State University of New York to assemble two teams of specialists and map what they call the coming crisis of hypertension: 1.56 billion people are expected to have it by 2025. With funding from drug maker Novartis Pharma AG, they're providing copies to governments and health officials around the globe; a briefing in Washington is set for Thursday. The report essentially calls for a cultural change. Consider: In the U.S., commiserating over blood pressure readings is an accepted dinner-table topic. Because black Americans are at especially high risk &#151; roughly 40 percent are affected &#151; hypertension has become a sermon topic at majority-black churches, and post-service screenings aren't uncommon. The government even advertises about the condition. That adds up to an openness about blood pressure not seen in much of the world, says report co-author Dr. Michael Weber of SUNY's Downstate College of Medicine. In some regions, "it's sort of an insult to your manhood if you have to take a blood-pressure medicine," Weber says, citing estimates that hypertension affects about one in three adults in Mexico, Paraguay and Venezuela. "We need to break those barriers as well and make it perfectly fashionable. We need to get role models in those countries to say, 'You know what? I've got high blood pressure.'" The U.S. still needs to improve, too, Weber hastens to add. High blood pressure affects nearly one in three adult Americans as well, or 72 million people. About a third have their condition well-controlled, not nearly enough but better than other countries that track treatment, the report found. Normal blood pressure is measured at less than 120 over 80. Anyone can get high blood pressure, a level of 140 over 90 or more. But being overweight and inactive, and eating too much salt, all increase the risk. So does getting older. The world's population is aging and fattening, fueling a continued increase in blood pressure problems. Remarkably, the report cites worse hypertension rates in much of Western Europe than in the U.S., despite cultural similarities: 38 percent in England, Sweden and Italy; 45 percent in Spain; 55 percent in Germany. But the biggest jump is expected in developing countries and nations rapidly moving to more Western-style economies, the report warns. In parts of India, studies suggest one in three urban adults has high blood pressure, while it's still rare in rural areas with more traditional lifestyles. More than a quarter of adults in China have hypertension. So do one in four in Ghana and South Africa. Treatment is difficult, because patients often quit their medicine, not understanding it's necessary even when they feel good. Also, doctors may be reluctant to prescribe the two- or three-drug combinations that half of patients wind up needing. For poorer countries, the tab for even low-cost diuretics is an issue &#151; not to mention public education about sticking to treatment, notes Smith, the World Heart Federation adviser, who was not involved in the new report. But fighting bad blood pressure could mean that developing countries avoid epidemics of full-blown heart disease, which they definitely can't afford, Smith stresses. World health and economic groups already are brainstorming strategies to help, such as whether industries that move into poor countries should be required to screen their workers for high blood pressure.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/usa_rumsfeld_letter_dc Rumsfeld&#39;s resignation letter remains elusive resignation letter remains elusive PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Bush administration is keeping a tight hold on Donald Rumsfeld&#39;s resignation letter nearly five months after the former defense secretary and war manager stepped down. says it does not have a copy, and the White House office likely to hold the letter is not subject to the law that allows the public to seek release of government documents, the Freedom of Information Act or A defense official, who declined to be identified publicly, on Tuesday chalked up the close hold on Rumsfeld&#39;s letter to the existence of few copies. "I suspect there&#39;s only one copy of that and it went to the president," the official said. Reuters filed FOIA requests for the letter with the Pentagon and White House. In response to a November request, the Defense Department&#39;s FOIA office said last month a "thorough search of the records systems ... revealed no records responsive to your request." President George W. Bush President George W. Bush &#39;s office of administration, in response to another FOIA request, said this month it too had no copy of Rumsfeld&#39;s resignation letter. But Carol Ehrlich, FOIA officer there, said the office of administration within the executive office of the president was a separate entity from the White House office, which controls its own records and is not subject to FOIA. Pentagon spokesmen refused to release the letter in November 2006, when Rumsfeld resigned after Republicans&#39; stinging election defeat. They told reporters to file FOIA requests for the letter.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/russia_aids_dc Russia warns of AIDS epidemic, 1.3 mln with HIV warns of AIDS epidemic, 1.3 mln with HIV PM ET MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia&#39;s epidemic is worsening with as many as 1.3 million people infected with as the virus spreads further into the heterosexual population, Russia&#39;s top AIDS specialist said on Tuesday. Russia has registered 402,000 people with HIV, of whom 17,000 have died, but the real figure is much higher, said Vadim Pokrovsky, head of Russia&#39;s federal AIDS centre. "Not only is the number of Russians infected with HIV rising but there is an increase in the rate at which the epidemic is spreading, so a rise in the number of newly infected," Pokrovsky told reporters. "We have an estimate of up to 1.2 million to 1.3 million infected with HIV," he said, adding that the number of those registered as infected was rising by 8 to 10 percent a year. estimates 65 million people worldwide have been infected with HIV and that 25 million people have been killed by AIDS since it was first recognized in 1981. AIDS, which stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Most of those infected with HIV are unaware they are carrying the virus, according to the UN. "ONE IN TEN MALES" Pokrovsky said HIV was high among Russia&#39;s intravenous drug users but that many of those newly infected were not needle users. And he warned that the virus was spreading fast into the heterosexual population. Women made up 44 percent of 39,589 registered new infections last year, he said adding that in some cities one in ten Russian males were infected with HIV. "Evidence of the strengthening heterosexual HIV infection is the increase in the number of women among those newly registered with HIV," Pokrovsky said. "On average for the country, one out of every fifty males is infected with HIV but in some cities it is one in ten," he said. Russia&#39;s northern city of St Petersburg was worst affected followed by Sverdlovsk region, greater Moscow, Samara region and Moscow, though Pokrovsky said figures for Moscow were probably much higher than the data indicated. The United Nations said in a report published on Tuesday that HIV was higher in richer regions. "HIV prevalence is in an inverse relationship to economic development: HIV is more widespread in &#39;rich&#39; regions," the UN said in a report about Russia&#39;s regions. Pokrovsky said overall funding for fighting AIDS in Russia was rising but that just 200 million roubles (&#36;7.75 million) would be spent on prevention in 2007 out of a total budget of 5.3 billion roubles (&#36;205.4 million). "The financing is sharply rising," he said. "There is now a lot of money, but the spending is not done entirely properly." "A very small amount of that money...is directed to preventing the further spread of the epidemic; most of it is being used for treatment. That is good but you need prevention too," he said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/healthbeat_blood_pressure Blood pressure rising around the globe pressure rising around the globe By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer AM ET WASHINGTON - The numbers are a shock: Almost 1 billion people worldwide have high blood pressure, and over half a billion more will harbor this silent killer by 2025. It's not just a problem for the ever-fattening Western world. Even in parts of Africa, high blood pressure is becoming common. That translates into millions of deaths from heart disease alone. Yet hypertension doesn't command the attention of, say, bird flu, which so far has killed fewer than 200 people. "Hypertension has gone a bit out of fashion," says Dr. Jan Ostergren of Sweden's Karolinska University Hospital, who co-authored a first-of-its-kind analysis of the global impact of high blood pressure. The idea: to rev up world governments to fight bad blood pressure just as countries have banded together in the past to fight infectious diseases. International heart specialists welcome the push. "Even in the U.S., the majority of people with high blood pressure are not treated adequately," says Dr. Sidney Smith of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who advises the World Heart Federation. "Look at China, look at Africa, go around the world. It is a major risk factor." And the dangers go well beyond the heart. High blood pressure is a leading cause of strokes and kidney failure. It also plays a role in blindness and even dementia. Patients seldom notice symptoms until organs already have been damaged. Yet treating high blood pressure before that happens is a medical best-buy. Improving diet and exercise can help. When that's not enough, blood pressure drugs are among the oldest and thus cheapest on the market &#151; 21 cents a day for a leading diuretic. Ostergren joined experts from the London School of Economics and the State University of New York to assemble two teams of specialists and map what they call the coming crisis of hypertension: 1.56 billion people are expected to have it by 2025. With funding from drug maker Novartis Pharma AG, they're providing copies to governments and health officials around the globe; a briefing in Washington is set for Thursday. The report essentially calls for a cultural change. Consider: In the U.S., commiserating over blood pressure readings is an accepted dinner-table topic. Because black Americans are at especially high risk &#151; roughly 40 percent are affected &#151; hypertension has become a sermon topic at majority-black churches, and post-service screenings aren't uncommon. The government even advertises about the condition. That adds up to an openness about blood pressure not seen in much of the world, says report co-author Dr. Michael Weber of SUNY's Downstate College of Medicine. In some regions, "it's sort of an insult to your manhood if you have to take a blood-pressure medicine," Weber says, citing estimates that hypertension affects about one in three adults in Mexico, Paraguay and Venezuela. "We need to break those barriers as well and make it perfectly fashionable. We need to get role models in those countries to say, 'You know what? I've got high blood pressure.'" The U.S. still needs to improve, too, Weber hastens to add. High blood pressure affects nearly one in three adult Americans as well, or 72 million people. About a third have their condition well-controlled, not nearly enough but better than other countries that track treatment, the report found. Normal blood pressure is measured at less than 120 over 80. Anyone can get high blood pressure, a level of 140 over 90 or more. But being overweight and inactive, and eating too much salt, all increase the risk. So does getting older. The world's population is aging and fattening, fueling a continued increase in blood pressure problems. Remarkably, the report cites worse hypertension rates in much of Western Europe than in the U.S., despite cultural similarities: 38 percent in England, Sweden and Italy; 45 percent in Spain; 55 percent in Germany. But the biggest jump is expected in developing countries and nations rapidly moving to more Western-style economies, the report warns. In parts of India, studies suggest one in three urban adults has high blood pressure, while it's still rare in rural areas with more traditional lifestyles. More than a quarter of adults in China have hypertension. So do one in four in Ghana and South Africa. Treatment is difficult, because patients often quit their medicine, not understanding it's necessary even when they feel good. Also, doctors may be reluctant to prescribe the two- or three-drug combinations that half of patients wind up needing. For poorer countries, the tab for even low-cost diuretics is an issue &#151; not to mention public education about sticking to treatment, notes Smith, the World Heart Federation adviser, who was not involved in the new report. But fighting bad blood pressure could mean that developing countries avoid epidemics of full-blown heart disease, which they definitely can't afford, Smith stresses. World health and economic groups already are brainstorming strategies to help, such as whether industries that move into poor countries should be required to screen their workers for high blood pressure.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/pesticides_schools AP: Children face exposure to pesticides Children face exposure to pesticides By GARANCE BURKE, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 22 minutes ago STRATHMORE, Calif. - On Grandparents Day, Domitila Lemus accompanied her 8-year-old granddaughter to school. As the girls lined up behind Sunnyside Union Elementary, a foul mist drifted onto the playground from the adjacent orange groves, witnesses say. Lemus started coughing, and two children collapsed in spasms, vomiting on the blacktop. She and the little girls have since recovered without apparent lasting effects. But an Associated Press investigation has found that over the past decade, hundreds, possibly thousands, of schoolchildren in California and other agricultural states have been exposed to farm chemicals linked to sickness, brain damage and birth defects. The family of at least one California teenager suspects pesticides caused her death. There are no federal laws specifically against spraying near schools, and advocates say California and the seven other states that have laws or policies creating buffer zones around schools to protect them from pesticides don't do enough to enforce them. "The regulations are inadequate. In the vast majority of cases, people who didn't follow the laws received at best a $400 fine," said Margaret Reeves, a scientist with the Pesticide Action Network, a nonprofit organization based in San Francisco. The pesticide industry says it is committed to safety, and regulators say they are doing their best to enforce the laws. "Everyone wants to protect children," said California Department of Pesticide Regulation spokesman Glenn Brank. He said his agency is doing what it can to enforce the law with a shortage of agricultural inspectors. In the Strathmore incident last November, grandparents said the spraying was being done less than 150 feet from the children. Tulare County authorities fined an unlicensed pest removal company $1,100 for spraying a restricted weed killer that morning. But no action was taken over what witnesses said happened to the children. Because no one reported the incident as a case of pesticide drift, county agricultural inspectors never swabbed the jungle gym or took grass samples, making it impossible to establish whether pesticide had, in fact, drifted onto the playground. does not keep comprehensive national figures on students and teachers sickened by drifting pesticide. In California, the No. 1 farm state and the one with the best records, there were 590 pesticide-related illnesses at schools from 1996 to 2005, according to figures given to the AP by the state. More than a third of those were due to pesticide drift, the figures show. Activists say that those numbers are low and that many cases are never even reported. In California's long, flat interior, spraying season lasts seven months, from March through September. When citrus trees blossom and grapevines climb trellises, Lemus prays to the Virgin Mary that her granddaughter won't come home with her eyes watering and head pounding, unable to breathe. Tulare County, where she lives, is one of the nation's most fertile farm regions, with more than half the schools within a quarter-mile of agricultural fields, according to the nonprofit Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment. As suburbs push close to farmland, the rate of pesticide poisoning among children nationwide has risen in recent years, according to a 2005 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association Journal of the American Medical Association . The study found that 40 percent of all children sickened by pesticides at school were victims of drift &#151; pesticide carried on the breeze. Research on pregnant women exposed to common pesticides has suggested higher rates of premature birth, and poor neurological development and smaller head circumferences among their babies. The effects on children of small, repeated exposures over a long period of time are unclear, said University of California, Berkeley epidemiologist Brenda Eskenazi. But acute pesticide poisoning can cause nausea, blurred vision, an abnormally fast heart rate, paralysis and death. Chrissy Garavito, a 15-year-old high school sophomore, died in Fontana in 1997 of a heart rhythm disturbance her mother believes was triggered by exposure to chemicals sprayed at the school. Authorities never confirmed that pesticides contributed to her death. In 2001, pesticide poisoning nearly killed Elena Dominguez, then a sixth-grader in Wenatchee, Wash. One day, after playing Frisbee during gym class across the street from an apple orchard, she passed out at her desk. "She was in a stupor," said her mother, Cindy Dominguez. "She couldn't talk, her eyes were rolling back in her head." Emergency room doctors dismissed Elena's abnormally fast heart rate as a symptom of dehydration, gave her intravenous fluids and sent her home. Three weeks later, it happened again. "I was at a track meet and all of a sudden I felt really, really tired," said Elena, now 18. "I made it to the finish line and just fell over." Investigators found her clothes were soaked in the pesticide Endosulfan I; it had been picked up from residue on the grass and absorbed into her bloodstream through her skin. Officials later found five other pesticides on school grounds and fined the apple grower for forging his applicator's license. The Dominguez family sued the orchard owner and the Wenatchee school district, which established rules requiring students to stay inside after a spraying, among other things. State officials believe it is the only district in Washington with such limitations. But keeping students inside may not be enough. Two years ago, 600 students and staff members were evacuated from an Edinburg, Texas, elementary school after pesticides drifted from a cotton field into the school's air conditioning system. Thirty-nine people developed nausea and headaches. EPA officials say they have no real idea how often pesticides waft onto school grounds. The EPA must register pesticides before they are sold, but federal law does not restrict where they can be sprayed. "We implement the laws that Congress gives us," said Ruth Allen, an EPA epidemiologist. Once the EPA approves a product, federal law requires manufacturers to report any "unreasonable adverse effects on the environment of the pesticide" that their products cause. Activists say industry is essentially allowed to police itself. CropLife America, a national organization representing suppliers of farm pesticides, said their use near schools is well-regulated. "We're really committed to public safety," said spokeswoman Donna Uchida. "Any kind of use of a pesticide has a labeling requirement that is imposed to protect human health and the environment." California has some of the strictest pesticide laws in the nation. Under state law, growers and pest control companies can be fined if pesticide drifts from a field and sickens people. A 2002 state law allows county authorities to establish a no-spray buffer zone of a quarter-mile around schools. But Tulare County has not done so. State officials said they did not know how many counties have set up such buffer zones. Lemus and environmentalists are pushing for pesticide-free zones throughout California. "Why don't they tell us they'll spray beforehand so we can bring our children inside?" Lemus said. Students sickened when pesticides drift AP via Yahoo!

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/congress_credit_cards Bill would ban some credit card actions would ban some credit card actions By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer WASHINGTON - Legislation proposed Tuesday would outlaw some credit-card billing and interest-rate practices that critics say confuse consumers and can push them deeper into debt. The bill authored by Sens. Carl Levin ( ), D-Mich., chairman of the and Governmental Affairs Committee's investigative panel, and Claire McCaskill ( ), D-Mo., would ban interest from being charged on any portion of a credit card debt that the consumer paid on time during a grace period. It also would limit so-called penalty increases in interest rates, which are imposed when a payment is made after the due date, to a maximum 7 percentage points above the current rate. The legislation was heralded by consumer groups. Many lawmakers, however, have expressed reluctance to impose mandates on how banks do business. Sen. Christopher Dodd ( ), D-Conn., who heads the Senate Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction on the issue, said he will examine the proposal "in a careful and thoughtful fashion." The banking industry opposes such legislation. "We worry about micro-managing the pricing of financial products in a way that may ultimately hurt consumers," said Ken Clayton, managing director of credit card policy at the American Bankers Association. Heightened scrutiny of credit card practices has come from the new Democratic-controlled Congress, which has put a number of consumer issues on its legislative agenda. With Americans weighed down by some $850 billion in consumer debt, the practices of the robustly profitable credit card industry are a compelling subject for scrutiny. Amid the congressional focus, several major banks recently began to eliminate or temper some of the practices. An investigation by Levin's subcommittee found abusive and confusing practices, and repeated penalties imposed by credit card issuers that are said to amplify the financial woes of many Americans while bringing in tens of millions of dollars for the companies. The bill also would: _Require increased interest rates to apply only to future debt on a credit card account, not to debt incurred prior to the increase. _Prohibit charging of interest on credit card account fees, such as late payment fees and fees for going over the credit limit. _Prohibit charging of repeated over-limit fees for a single instance of exceeding a credit limit, and allow the fees to be charged only when the consumer's action, rather than a penalty, causes the limit to be exceeded. _Ban so-called "pay-to-pay" fees, often charged when consumers make payments on their accounts by telephone. Such fees would be prohibited for any form of payment, including mail or electronic transfer. _Require payments to be applied first to the portion of the account balance with the highest interest rate. _Ban the practice known as "universal default," in which credit card issuers raise interest rates for customers because they're late on payments to other creditors separate from the account in question.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/iraq_media_ban No photos allowed after Iraqi blasts photos allowed after Iraqi blasts By KIM GAMEL, Associated Press Writer PM ET BAGHDAD - Police fired warning shots in the air at the scene of a double bombing Tuesday, enforcing an order banning news photographers and TV camera operators from filming the aftermath of deadly bombings. The Iraqi government said it decided last weekend to keep photographers and camera crews away from blast sites to prevent them from damaging forensic evidence. Media groups feared the order was aimed at preventing scenes of horrific carnage from being broadcast around the world. The ban got its first test Tuesday, when a pair of bombs hidden in plastic bags exploded in two shops selling CDs and cigarettes in Tayaran Square in central Baghdad. Police said at least seven people were killed and 17 wounded. News photographers and cameraman rushed to the scene only to be turned away by Iraqi police, who fired warning shots in the air to disperse the crowds. Interior Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Abdul-Karim Khalaf defended the decision and said it would only last for an hour after the explosion. He said the move was not designed to curtail press freedom but to protect evidence and the privacy of the wounded. He also said the government wanted to keep insurgents from filming the scene for use in propaganda videos. "I would like to say that this is not a total ban. It is a short ban because after one hour from the explosion, journalists will have the freedom to do their work," he added, saying the ban was nationwide and would include the state-run TV station Iraqiya. Iraqi and U.S. authorities have frequently complained that the publicity surrounding car bombings and suicide attacks is jeopardizing their efforts to stop the violence, which has proven unrelenting as Sunni insurgents adopt new tactics to evade stepped-up security measures. Reporters Without Borders expressed concern about the decision, saying it "feared that growing restrictions on the media could end in a total news blackout." The international advocacy group stressed the importance of the images in providing an accurate assessment of the toll the violence is taking on Iraqi lives as well as the security situation in the capital, where movement is severely limited. "When the streets become impassable and the authorities provide no information about the attacks in real time, the role of the reporter becomes essential. Coverage of these attacks allows people to evaluate the security risk and to avoid dangerous areas," it said. Shihab al-Tamimi, the head of the Iraqi Journalists Union, said he understood the Interior Ministry's concerns. "But at the same time, the security forces should give more understanding to the work of journalists. The journalists have a job to do and they should be able to do it if it does not break a law. For example, if a photographer is after a picture at the explosion site, that does not make him a propagandist for insurgents," al-Tamimi said. Iraqi authorities often have been criticized for imposing media restrictions since the U.S.-led invasion that ousted In August 2004, the government closed the Baghdad news office of Al-Jazeera television, accusing the station of inciting violence. The office is still closed but the station operates in the Kurdish-ruled area of the north. Reporters Without Borders also noted that the Iraqi parliament voted May 9 to take legal action against Al-Jazeera over perceived insults against top Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. In December 2006, parliament also briefly banned journalists from covering its sessions. Earlier this month, Freedom House, a nonprofit organization that describes itself as a "clear voice for democracy and freedom around the world," cited the Iraqi government for retaining repressive laws from Saddam's era and for the detentions of journalists without charge.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/fort_drum_missing_soldiers Missing soldiers from Fort Drum soldiers from Fort Drum 1 hour, 45 minutes ago FORT DRUM, N.Y. - The seven American victims of a weekend ambush in were members of the storied 10th Mountain Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Army officials in Iraq said Tuesday. The attack near Mahmoudiya, in a Sunni stronghold 20 miles south of Baghdad, left four U.S. soldiers and an Iraqi translator dead, and three other soldiers missing. acknowledged for the first time that it believes the missing soldiers are in terrorist hands. The Islamic State of Iraq &#151; an al-Qaida front group that has claimed to have captured the soldiers &#151; has warned the U.S. to stop its massive search for the missing. Military officials would not release the names of the soldiers until their families were notified but confirmed they were assigned to Company D, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, nicknamed the "Polar Bears," said Lt. Col. Paul Fitzpatrick, a Fort Drum spokesman. All the missing soldiers are men, Fitzpatrick said. "It's been the unfortunate experience that soldiers who have been captured have not all turned out well. We are hoping this turns out to be an exception," he said. The 10th Mountain Division has a reputation for success that dates to World War II. Ready to go anywhere in the world within 48 hours, the 10th Mountain is trained to fight in steamy jungles, sandy deserts, cities and, of course, mountains. Families of the soldiers released the names of two of the dead on Monday &#151; Sgt. 1st Class James David Connell Jr., 40, of Lake City, Tenn., and Pfc. Daniel Courneya, 19, of Vermontville, Mich. Connell's family learned of his death Saturday afternoon, they said. The soldier had just recovered from a shrapnel wound to the leg and had visited his family on leave this month. The family is now planning a memorial service in Lake City and a burial at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his brother, Jeff Connell. "I'm proud of my dad, because he didn't really fight for himself, he fought for the country," Connell's teenage daughter, Courtney, told Knoxville's WATE-TV. In Michigan, students at Maple Valley High School created a memorial for Courneya, who graduated in 2005 and was well-known in the small community southwest of Lansing. He was a member of the school's track and soccer teams and played clarinet in the band. "It's a tribute of photos, posters, plaques and a picture of him in his uniform," school official Kelly Zank told The Associated Press on Tuesday. His death was announced Monday over the school's public address system, and a moment of silence was observed, she said. Courneya's mother, Wendy Thompson, said his wife, Jennifer, called family members Saturday night to tell them he had been killed. Thompson said her husband, Army Spc. David Thompson, was in Iraq and returning home after learning of his stepson's death. If all three soldiers now missing were taken alive, it would be the biggest single abduction of U.S. soldiers in Iraq since March 23, 2003, when Pvt. Jessica Lynch and six others were captured in an ambush near Nasiriyah that also left 11 Americans dead. The 2nd Brigade Combat Team is in the 10th month of a 15-month tour in Iraq. The brigade was also deployed to Iraq in 2005. The 10th Mountain Division made its reputation in World War II, when soldiers scaled a sheer, 1,500-foot cliff under cover of darkness and fought their way through the snowy mountains of northern Italy in 1945. That spearheaded the drive that would liberate the country from the Nazis. The 10th Mountain was the Army's most frequently deployed division during the 1990s, serving in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere. The division's members became the first regular U.S. ground troops to be sent to Central Asia as part of American's response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Its soldiers provided security for U.S. Air Force fighter and combat search-and-rescue teams in Uzbekistan.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/congress_credit_cards Bill would ban some credit card actions would ban some credit card actions By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer WASHINGTON - Legislation proposed Tuesday would outlaw some credit-card billing and interest-rate practices that critics say confuse consumers and can push them deeper into debt. The bill authored by Sens. Carl Levin ( ), D-Mich., chairman of the and Governmental Affairs Committee's investigative panel, and Claire McCaskill ( ), D-Mo., would ban interest from being charged on any portion of a credit card debt that the consumer paid on time during a grace period. It also would limit so-called penalty increases in interest rates, which are imposed when a payment is made after the due date, to a maximum 7 percentage points above the current rate. The legislation was heralded by consumer groups. Many lawmakers, however, have expressed reluctance to impose mandates on how banks do business. Sen. Christopher Dodd ( ), D-Conn., who heads the Senate Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction on the issue, said he will examine the proposal "in a careful and thoughtful fashion." The banking industry opposes such legislation. "We worry about micro-managing the pricing of financial products in a way that may ultimately hurt consumers," said Ken Clayton, managing director of credit card policy at the American Bankers Association. Heightened scrutiny of credit card practices has come from the new Democratic-controlled Congress, which has put a number of consumer issues on its legislative agenda. With Americans weighed down by some $850 billion in consumer debt, the practices of the robustly profitable credit card industry are a compelling subject for scrutiny. Amid the congressional focus, several major banks recently began to eliminate or temper some of the practices. An investigation by Levin's subcommittee found abusive and confusing practices, and repeated penalties imposed by credit card issuers that are said to amplify the financial woes of many Americans while bringing in tens of millions of dollars for the companies. The bill also would: _Require increased interest rates to apply only to future debt on a credit card account, not to debt incurred prior to the increase. _Prohibit charging of interest on credit card account fees, such as late payment fees and fees for going over the credit limit. _Prohibit charging of repeated over-limit fees for a single instance of exceeding a credit limit, and allow the fees to be charged only when the consumer's action, rather than a penalty, causes the limit to be exceeded. _Ban so-called "pay-to-pay" fees, often charged when consumers make payments on their accounts by telephone. Such fees would be prohibited for any form of payment, including mail or electronic transfer. _Require payments to be applied first to the portion of the account balance with the highest interest rate. _Ban the practice known as "universal default," in which credit card issuers raise interest rates for customers because they're late on payments to other creditors separate from the account in question.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/usa_rumsfeld_letter_dc Rumsfeld&#39;s resignation letter remains elusive resignation letter remains elusive PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Bush administration is keeping a tight hold on Donald Rumsfeld&#39;s resignation letter nearly five months after the former defense secretary and war manager stepped down. says it does not have a copy, and the White House office likely to hold the letter is not subject to the law that allows the public to seek release of government documents, the Freedom of Information Act or A defense official, who declined to be identified publicly, on Tuesday chalked up the close hold on Rumsfeld&#39;s letter to the existence of few copies. "I suspect there&#39;s only one copy of that and it went to the president," the official said. Reuters filed FOIA requests for the letter with the Pentagon and White House. In response to a November request, the Defense Department&#39;s FOIA office said last month a "thorough search of the records systems ... revealed no records responsive to your request." President George W. Bush President George W. Bush &#39;s office of administration, in response to another FOIA request, said this month it too had no copy of Rumsfeld&#39;s resignation letter. But Carol Ehrlich, FOIA officer there, said the office of administration within the executive office of the president was a separate entity from the White House office, which controls its own records and is not subject to FOIA. Pentagon spokesmen refused to release the letter in November 2006, when Rumsfeld resigned after Republicans&#39; stinging election defeat. They told reporters to file FOIA requests for the letter.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/mexican_trucks House votes to restrict Mexican trucks votes to restrict Mexican trucks By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 42 minutes ago WASHINGTON - The House voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to delay a Bush administration plan to allow Mexican trucks full access to U.S. highways. The trucks would have to be declared safe first, the lawmakers said, and Mexico would have to give U.S. truckers the same access south of the border. The House voted 411-3 to approve a three-year Department of Transportation pilot program that would restrict opening the border to 100 carriers based in Mexico. They would be allowed to use a maximum of 1,000 vehicles under the pilot program. The Bush administration wanted to start a pilot program this year that would run for a year before fully opening the border to Mexican trucks. The House bill, however, specifies criteria for the pilot program before it can start, including setting up an independent panel to evaluate the test program and getting certification from the inspector general that safety and inspection requirements have been met. The Department of Transportation says it could be as late as 2008 before Congress's criteria are met, according to the Lawmakers said their major concern is whether Mexican trucks, often older than U.S. cargo vehicles, and Mexican drivers will be able to meet rigorous U.S. safety standards. "We do not need 90,000-pound unguided missiles on our highways," said Rep. Robin Hayes ( American trucking companies have spent years getting their vehicles up to the Transportation Department standards, lawmakers said. Letting Mexican trucks across the border without making them meet those standards is wrong, they said. "We're going to have a major accident somewhere, and people are going to say, 'How did this happen?" said Rep. Bob Filner ( Added Rep. Candice Miller ( ), R-Mich: "We need to ensure that this program only takes places after the Mexican companies meet the same conditions that American companies do." Lawmakers also complained that allowing Mexican trucks greater access will cost American truckers their jobs. "You can get a Mexican truck driver to work for a heck of a lot less than a Teamster in the United States, and you can get a Mexican dock worker to work for a heck of a lot less than a longshoreman in the United States and that's what this is ultimately designed to do," said Rep. Peter DeFazio ( , Public Citizen and the Environmental Law Foundation sued in federal court in April to block the pilot program, citing safety and environmental concerns. "We don't know how safety laws such as hours of service and drug testing would be enforced," Teamster President Jim Hoffa said. "This vote by the House repudiates those questionable attempts to open our borders without adequate safeguards." The Bush administration had planned to run a yearlong pilot program that would allow Mexican trucks beyond the current 20-mile limit from the border but the launch was halted after complaints from Congress. Since 1982, trucks have had to stop within the buffer zone and transfer their loads to U.S. truckers to take them into the country. The legislation would allow Mexican drivers to take their loads from Mexico to any point within the country. Supporters of the plan say letting more Mexican trucks on U.S. highways will save American consumers hundreds of millions of dollars. They include many in the trucking industry, the Bush administration and lawmakers who favor the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. Access to all U.S. highways was promised by 2000 under the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement, as was access through Mexico for U.S. carriers. That aspect has been stalled by lawsuits and disagreements between the two countries, though Canadian and U.S. trucks travel freely across the northern border. The bill number is HR 1773.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/iraq_media_ban No photos allowed after Iraqi blasts photos allowed after Iraqi blasts By KIM GAMEL, Associated Press Writer PM ET BAGHDAD - Police fired warning shots in the air at the scene of a double bombing Tuesday, enforcing an order banning news photographers and TV camera operators from filming the aftermath of deadly bombings. The Iraqi government said it decided last weekend to keep photographers and camera crews away from blast sites to prevent them from damaging forensic evidence. Media groups feared the order was aimed at preventing scenes of horrific carnage from being broadcast around the world. The ban got its first test Tuesday, when a pair of bombs hidden in plastic bags exploded in two shops selling CDs and cigarettes in Tayaran Square in central Baghdad. Police said at least seven people were killed and 17 wounded. News photographers and cameraman rushed to the scene only to be turned away by Iraqi police, who fired warning shots in the air to disperse the crowds. Interior Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Abdul-Karim Khalaf defended the decision and said it would only last for an hour after the explosion. He said the move was not designed to curtail press freedom but to protect evidence and the privacy of the wounded. He also said the government wanted to keep insurgents from filming the scene for use in propaganda videos. "I would like to say that this is not a total ban. It is a short ban because after one hour from the explosion, journalists will have the freedom to do their work," he added, saying the ban was nationwide and would include the state-run TV station Iraqiya. Iraqi and U.S. authorities have frequently complained that the publicity surrounding car bombings and suicide attacks is jeopardizing their efforts to stop the violence, which has proven unrelenting as Sunni insurgents adopt new tactics to evade stepped-up security measures. Reporters Without Borders expressed concern about the decision, saying it "feared that growing restrictions on the media could end in a total news blackout." The international advocacy group stressed the importance of the images in providing an accurate assessment of the toll the violence is taking on Iraqi lives as well as the security situation in the capital, where movement is severely limited. "When the streets become impassable and the authorities provide no information about the attacks in real time, the role of the reporter becomes essential. Coverage of these attacks allows people to evaluate the security risk and to avoid dangerous areas," it said. Shihab al-Tamimi, the head of the Iraqi Journalists Union, said he understood the Interior Ministry's concerns. "But at the same time, the security forces should give more understanding to the work of journalists. The journalists have a job to do and they should be able to do it if it does not break a law. For example, if a photographer is after a picture at the explosion site, that does not make him a propagandist for insurgents," al-Tamimi said. Iraqi authorities often have been criticized for imposing media restrictions since the U.S.-led invasion that ousted In August 2004, the government closed the Baghdad news office of Al-Jazeera television, accusing the station of inciting violence. The office is still closed but the station operates in the Kurdish-ruled area of the north. Reporters Without Borders also noted that the Iraqi parliament voted May 9 to take legal action against Al-Jazeera over perceived insults against top Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. In December 2006, parliament also briefly banned journalists from covering its sessions. Earlier this month, Freedom House, a nonprofit organization that describes itself as a "clear voice for democracy and freedom around the world," cited the Iraqi government for retaining repressive laws from Saddam's era and for the detentions of journalists without charge.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/fort_drum_missing_soldiers Missing soldiers from Fort Drum soldiers from Fort Drum 1 hour, 46 minutes ago FORT DRUM, N.Y. - The seven American victims of a weekend ambush in were members of the storied 10th Mountain Division's 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Army officials in Iraq said Tuesday. The attack near Mahmoudiya, in a Sunni stronghold 20 miles south of Baghdad, left four U.S. soldiers and an Iraqi translator dead, and three other soldiers missing. acknowledged for the first time that it believes the missing soldiers are in terrorist hands. The Islamic State of Iraq &#151; an al-Qaida front group that has claimed to have captured the soldiers &#151; has warned the U.S. to stop its massive search for the missing. Military officials would not release the names of the soldiers until their families were notified but confirmed they were assigned to Company D, 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, nicknamed the "Polar Bears," said Lt. Col. Paul Fitzpatrick, a Fort Drum spokesman. All the missing soldiers are men, Fitzpatrick said. "It's been the unfortunate experience that soldiers who have been captured have not all turned out well. We are hoping this turns out to be an exception," he said. The 10th Mountain Division has a reputation for success that dates to World War II. Ready to go anywhere in the world within 48 hours, the 10th Mountain is trained to fight in steamy jungles, sandy deserts, cities and, of course, mountains. Families of the soldiers released the names of two of the dead on Monday &#151; Sgt. 1st Class James David Connell Jr., 40, of Lake City, Tenn., and Pfc. Daniel Courneya, 19, of Vermontville, Mich. Connell's family learned of his death Saturday afternoon, they said. The soldier had just recovered from a shrapnel wound to the leg and had visited his family on leave this month. The family is now planning a memorial service in Lake City and a burial at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his brother, Jeff Connell. "I'm proud of my dad, because he didn't really fight for himself, he fought for the country," Connell's teenage daughter, Courtney, told Knoxville's WATE-TV. In Michigan, students at Maple Valley High School created a memorial for Courneya, who graduated in 2005 and was well-known in the small community southwest of Lansing. He was a member of the school's track and soccer teams and played clarinet in the band. "It's a tribute of photos, posters, plaques and a picture of him in his uniform," school official Kelly Zank told The Associated Press on Tuesday. His death was announced Monday over the school's public address system, and a moment of silence was observed, she said. Courneya's mother, Wendy Thompson, said his wife, Jennifer, called family members Saturday night to tell them he had been killed. Thompson said her husband, Army Spc. David Thompson, was in Iraq and returning home after learning of his stepson's death. If all three soldiers now missing were taken alive, it would be the biggest single abduction of U.S. soldiers in Iraq since March 23, 2003, when Pvt. Jessica Lynch and six others were captured in an ambush near Nasiriyah that also left 11 Americans dead. The 2nd Brigade Combat Team is in the 10th month of a 15-month tour in Iraq. The brigade was also deployed to Iraq in 2005. The 10th Mountain Division made its reputation in World War II, when soldiers scaled a sheer, 1,500-foot cliff under cover of darkness and fought their way through the snowy mountains of northern Italy in 1945. That spearheaded the drive that would liberate the country from the Nazis. The 10th Mountain was the Army's most frequently deployed division during the 1990s, serving in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Egypt, Iraq and elsewhere. The division's members became the first regular U.S. ground troops to be sent to Central Asia as part of American's response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Its soldiers provided security for U.S. Air Force fighter and combat search-and-rescue teams in Uzbekistan.
