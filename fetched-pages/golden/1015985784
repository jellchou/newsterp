One night after a loss that sucked the oxygen from their blood and the joy from their souls, the Giants needed a little nourishment and Zito gave them a seven-course feast. He blanked the New York Mets for seven innings, defining the term "stopper," in a 3-0 victory that ended his team's losing streak at four games. "It was awesome, outstanding," said shortstop Omar Vizquel, who contributed four excellent defensive plays. "I think he knew he needed to turn it on tonight and he did, in New York, against a good team. He wanted to show everybody out here what he was all about. It was a great outcome for him." Some pitchers say all wins are the same. Zito recognized this one was not, that after Tuesday's 12-inning balk-a-palooza he had to stand 11 feet high against 295-game winner Tom Glavine, because that is what an ace is supposed to do. "I take that seriously," Zito said. "In 2002 with Oakland I had a real good record after losses (13-1). That's something the team feeds off of. When we had a losing streak, the team could rely on me. It's an important role." Zito allowed six hits, walked one and struck out a season-high seven for his second consecutive victory and his second win against the Mets. He swore he does not want to pitch "with a vendetta against people," but here is a fact: Before the Giants sent the Brinks truck to Zito's driveway, he was negotiating with the Mets. A little birdie spread word that Zito no longer was an ace and no better than a middle-rotation starter, perhaps to drive his price down. Zito believed the birdie had "M-E-T-S" written across its chest. Commanding his curveball and rarely making Bengie Molina move his glove, Zito held Tuesday heroes Jose Reyes and Carlos Delgado hitless in five at-bats combined. No Met reached third base. After throwing 122 pitches, Zito gave way to Jack Taschner for a scoreless eighth, and Brad Hennessey fanned Delgado to start a perfect ninth for his third career save, a good audition should the Giants decide to try another closer. The vilified Armando Benitez was said to be unavailable with swelling in his right knee, which needed to be drained. Pedro Feliz drove in all three runs in rallies that began with two outs. He hit a bases-loaded single on a 3-2 pitch in the first inning that scored Rich Aurilia and Barry Bonds, who each had singled. In the third, Molina singled and scored from first on Feliz's triple off the center-field wall. Feliz had been 2-for-12 lifetime against Glavine. Feliz hit each ball when he was ahead in the count. Perhaps he is learning from Molina, who bats ahead of him and wears pitchers out. Molina saw eight pitches when he walked in the first inning to load the bases and 10 more when he singled in the third. "He is a grinder," manager Bruce Bochy said of his catcher. "He competes so well. He gets great at-bats and he never gives away at-bats. He battles all the time. We know about the clutch hits, and even when he doesn't get a hit, he knows how to build the count up and use all fields." Perhaps the best development for the Giants was Aurilia's 4-for-4 night, coming toward the end of what he described Tuesday as "one of the worst months I've had in a long time." He was 9-for-67 in May before facing Glavine. "I think I matched my last three-week total for hits tonight," Aurilia said. "I made a few adjustments in the cage before the game with the staff. There were a couple of things my teammates saw. It was great to actually implement it and have it work. Hopefully, I can keep it up." The team hopes Zito can keep it up, too. He has allowed one run in his last 14 innings to improve to 5-5. Vizquel faced Zito in the American League and was asked if the left-hander looks the same from behind now as he did when Vizquel used to face him from the batter's box. Vizquel thought for a second and said, "I see a bigger ass now." E-mail Henry Schulman at This article appeared on page Get up to 50% off home delivery of the Chronicle for 12 weeks!

Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Jesse Litsch, left, and Sal Fasano react to a play against the New York Yankees during the first inning of last night's game. Toronto's Litsch pounded early ending Jays' two-game win streak TORONTO (May 31, 2007) The Toronto Blue Jays found a way to make things interesting last night after reality kicked rookie Jesse Litsch right in the gut. Litsch, a mere 22 and the toast of the town two weeks ago when he pitched a gem in his big-league debut, was pounded for five runs and failed to escape the first inning. His teammates nearly rallied against the shaky New York Yankees, pulling within one a two-run shot by Matt Stairs in the seventh, but ultimately fell short in a 10-5 loss. Some more dubious on-field antics by Alex Rodriguez in the ninth gave things a nasty turn. The Yankees scored four in the inning, three of them after Rodriguez seemed to yell "Mine!" while running past third baseman Howie Clark as he settled under Jorge Posada's pop fly. Instead of an inning-ending out with the score 7-5, Clark flinched and dropped the ball, allowing another run to score. Shortstop John McDonald immediately began jawing at Rodriguez and had to be restrained by Clark. Manager John Gibbons ran out to argue the play with the umpires and later shouted at Rodriguez as he walked off the field. Jason Giambi followed with a two-run single that made it 10-5. It wouldn't be the first time Rodriguez pulled such a stunt on the field. In Game 6 of the 2004 ALCS versus Boston, he slapped at pitcher Bronson Arroyo's glove on a play at first base. The defeat ended a modest two-game win streak for the Blue Jays (24-28) before a crowd of 29,187 and temporarily stopped the bleeding for the nine-time AL East-champion Yankees. New York (22-29) had lost five straight and 13 of 18 coming into this one and woke up yesterday morning to find pictures of Rodriguez at his hotel with a woman that wasn't his wife splashed all over the New York Post under the headline, "Stray-Rod." It could have been another dagger for an already reeling team but they instead took out some frustration against Litsch (1-2), whose spot on the roster is in doubt with ace Roy Halladay set to come off the disabled list to start against Chicago.

The Anaheim Ducks' centre, who has found the National Hockey League playoff spotlight because of his stingy work on the defensive side of the puck, continued to lift his team with some timely offence. Pahlsson, who scored the series-winner against the Detroit Red Wings to put the Ducks into the Stanley Cup final, scored only his third goal of the playoffs on a screen shot with 5 minutes 44 seconds remaining to give the Ducks a 1-0 victory over the Ottawa Senators last night and a 2-0 lead in the series, which will shift to Ottawa for the next two games at Scotiabank Place on Saturday and Monday. The game-winning play, which transpired before a sellout crowd of 17,258 at the Honda Center, began when Senators forward Dany Heatley turned the puck over at the Anaheim blueline. Print Edition - Section Front History not on Ottawa's side now Rodriguez's call-out leaves Jays fuming Yankees light up Litsch to avoid sweep Allen faces challenge for starter's job Montreal club ready to add another chapter to its rich history Go to the section Instead of dumping the puck in, Heatley attempted a cute pass to linemate Jason Spezza and the puck squirted to Pahlsson. Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson was unable to stymie his Swedish countryman on the backcheck and Pahlsson's shot beat Senators goaltender Ray Emery, who was screened by Ottawa defenceman Joe Corvo. &#34;On that particular play, we turned the puck over and Alfredsson couldn't get his stick on him,&#34; Senators head coach Bryan Murray said. &#34;That's been the key. We're committing turnovers and creating chances for them.&#34; The Ducks' checking line also scored the game-winner in the first game of the series, when Travis Moen put the puck into the net late in the third period on Monday. &#34;[Anaheim's] defence and checking line have been the stars so far,&#34; Murray said. In the territorial play, the Ducks completely dominated the second game. They outshot the Senators 30-16 (60-36 in the series so far), missed 18 more, while the Senators blocked 20 more. Ottawa, on the other hand, has had difficulty generating any sustained periods of offensive pressure. &#34;They keep the puck on the outside very well,&#34; Murray said. &#34;We had some good fore-checks, but couldn't take advantage of it. &#34;We have to take advantage of our home ice.&#34; Senators forward Peter Schaefer had a half-open net to shoot at with slightly more than three minutes remaining, but his rebound attempt was deflected wide off the stick of Anaheim defenceman Sean O'Donnell. Ducks goalie Jean-S&#233;bastien Gigu&#232;re earned his sixth career playoff shutout as he blanked the Senators, who have not scored in the past 90:24 of the series. The Senators showed up for the the second game with new line combinations, as Murray decided to split up his No. 1 trio of Spezza, Alfredsson and Heatley, although they were together on power plays. Spezza and Heatley played alongside tough guy Chris Neil, while Alfredsson played with centre Mike Fisher and Schaefer. The Senators' third line featured Chris Kelly between Antoine Vermette and Mike Comrie. Murray replaced fourth-liner Patrick Eaves in the lineup with Oleg Saprykin, who scored a game-winning goal early in the Eastern Conference final against the Buffalo Sabres. So how did the Ducks counteract the Senators' alterations? Head coach Randy Carlyle kept his checking specialists - Pahlsson, Rob Niedermayer and Travis Moen, the hero of the first game - against Spezza. The Ducks' No. 1 unit of Andy McDonald, Teemu Selanne and Andrew Miller went up against the Alfredsson line. Both teams had three power-play opportunities in the goalless opening 20 minutes. The Senators had a 68-second 5-on-3 advantage, during which Comrie slammed a rebound attempt off the post. The Ducks had two close calls early in the period, but Emery stopped shots by Selanne and Ryan Getzlaf. The Pahlsson line got the better of its opponents early in the second period, but either failed to finish or could not find a way to beat Emery. Spezza was reunited with Alfredsson and Heatley later in the second period, a move recommended by former Detroit Red Wings head coach Scotty Bowman when he discussed strategy with Murray earlier in the week. Bowman counselled Murray to break up his big line, only to reunite it periodically. Number of 5-on-5 goals for the Ottawa Senators during the first and second games of the Stanley Cup final. Sami Pahlsson of the Anaheim Ducks skates by Ottawa's Daniel Alfredsson to score the game-winner with less than six minutes to play in the third period.

The Grizzlies declined to provide more details about the news conference. The Commercial Appeal newspaper, citing unidentified sources close to the search, reported that the Grizzlies have agreed to a three-year deal with Iavaroni. A news conference is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET Thursday. An assistant to Grizzlies owner Michael Heisley told The Associated Press he was unavailable for comment. Iavaroni, who joined the Suns coaching staff in 2002, is a 14-year veteran of the NBA as a player and coach. He was an assistant and director of player development for the under Pat Riley before joining the Suns. Memphis finished the season at 22-60, for the worst record in the league, and ended up a disappointing fourth in the June 28 draft lottery. At 6-24, the Grizzlies fired former coach Mike Fratello in December, replacing him with Tony Barone Sr., the team's director of player personnel. Barone's appointment was announced as temporary and he is expected to return to non-coaching duties with the franchise. The disappointing season, which began with star sidelined with a foot injury, followed three straight trips to the NBA playoffs. The Grizzlies moved to Memphis in 2001 and under president Jerry West, who joined the team the following year, made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history in 2004. The Grizzlies were swept in all three playoff appearances, however, and have the league's longest postseason losing streak. West has said he will leave the Grizzlies when his contract expires July 1. Iavaroni was an NBA player from 1982-1989 with Philadelphia, San Antonio and Utah. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

"I know it was a long time ago," Bedard said. He was reminded that it was April 18 at Tampa Bay. "That's a long time," Bedard said. It's not because he had been pitching poorly, but quite the contrary. In his first five May starts, he was 0-1 with a 2.12 earned run average, allowing just eight runs and 21 hits in 34 innings. The Orioles, however, scored but 12 runs in those five starts. Bedard is back in the 'W' column after throwing eight scoreless innings in a 3-0 victory over the Royals on Wednesday night. The Orioles have won five straight in a season for the first time since an eight-game winning streak in April, 2005. "I'm sure the lack of wins has been on his mind a little bit," Orioles manager Sam Perlozzo said. "I thought it was a great effort tonight from him. We hung in there and persevered." Bedard said "it's part of the game," to go through a stretch of winless starts. "It happened last year," he said. "It happens every year; you go through a span where you won't win five or six games in a row and then you'll win four or five in a row." The Orioles managed just one hit off Royals starter Gil Meche in the first six innings and neither team scored in the first seven innings. "It's always tough when it zero-zero late in the game," Bedard said. Ramon Hernandez led off the eighth with a walk and Freddie Bynum ran for him. Manager Sam Perlozzo ordered Corey Patterson to put down a sacrifice bunt and the speedy Patterson beat it out. "I had to sacrifice and everybody in the whole park knew I was doing it," Patterson said. "I got the sign. I just really concentrated on getting it down. I had a pretty good touch on it and since I run pretty good, [I] was able to beat it out. We have a lot better chance there with runners on first and second with no outs than a runner at second with one out, so I was glad to contribute to that." Brian Roberts' sacrifice bunt advanced the runners to second and third. With the infield in Jay Payton wormed a single to left to score Bynum to break the scoreless deadlock. "I think he [Payton] likes the stage a little bit," Perlozzo said. "He likes being the guy. That's good. I hope that rubs off on everyone." Said Payton, "I was fortunate to get the ball through the infield and help us win a ball game. I think it was a slider and down. It probably wasn't even a strike. I was looking to stay back and hit the ball up the middle and got in front of it a little bit and found a hole." Bedard held the Royals to four singles, walked two and struck out five, throwing 112 pitches before departing after eight innings, which matches his career high. "Bedard has been phenomenal," Payton said. "It's nice to get him a win. He's been pitching great for us and we haven't been able to push a lot of runs across for him. When you're the ace of the staff, a lot of times you run against the other's team ace and run into some hard luck." In sweeping the three games at Kauffman Stadium, the Orioles' trio of Steve Trachsel, Jeremy Guthrie and Bedard limited the Royals to 12 hits and three runs in 24 innings. Nick Markakis, who was inserted as a defensive replacement in the eighth, hit a two-run homer in the ninth off reliever Zack Greinke for the final runs. Bedard pitched out of a jam in the third when John Buck and Tony Pena Jr. singled, putting runners on the corners with one out. Bedard struck out Esteban German and retired David DeJesus on a soft liner to Roberts to strand the runners. "To get out of trouble early is really the key in pitching," Bedard said. "I made some good pitches at the right time and I got them out." Chris Ray worked a flawless ninth, striking out one, to log his 12th save in 14 opportunities. Rain delayed the start of the game for 96 minutes, but not the inevitable: the Orioles improving to 6-0 against the Royals this season. is a contributor to MLB.com This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.

It did, however, help the New York Yankees snap a five-game losing streak. Rodriguez distracted Toronto third baseman Howie Clark by shouting at him on a key popup in the ninth inning, touching off arguments all over the field, and the Yankees beat the Blue Jays 10-5 Wednesday night. "I just said, 'Hah!' That's it," Rodriguez said. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't." "I don't know what my intention was," he said. "I didn't say, 'I got it' or anything like that." Clark claimed Rodriguez called for the ball. "I heard a 'Mine' call and so I let it go," Clark said. "What do you do? It makes you mad." In other AL games it was, Minnesota 7, Chicago 6; Oakland 6, Texas 1; Cleveland 8, Boston 4; Tampa Bay 5, Detroit 3; Baltimore 3, Kansas City 0; and Los Angeles 8, Seattle 6. At Toronto, Rodriguez hit an RBI single with two outs in the ninth that made it 7-5. Jorge Posada followed with a high infield pop and Rodriguez ran hard, cutting between Clark and shortstop John McDonald. Replays showed Rodriguez shouting something, and Clark backed off at the last second. McDonald was only a few steps behind Clark, but couldn't make the catch and ball dropped for an RBI single. After the play, McDonald started jawing with Rodriguez, and third base umpire Chad Fairchild got between them. Blue Jays manager John Gibbons came out to argue, and exchanged words with Rodriguez and third base coach Larry Bowa before leaving the field as plate umpire Eric Cooper intervened. Rodriguez stayed on the bag with a smirk. "The thing about the Yankees, one of the reasons they're so respected, is they do things right. Always have," Gibbons said. "They've got a lot of pride and a lot of class. They play the game hard. "That's not Yankee pride right there. That's not the way they play. I thought it was bush league." Clark said he'd never seen &#8212; or heard &#8212; that play before. "This is my 16th season and it's never happened once," he said. As Jason Giambi stepped up to hit after the popup, he seemed to get into it with catcher Jason Phillips and Cooper settled them down. Giambi followed with a two-run single. When the game ended, many of the Blue Jays stayed on the bench, staring at Rodriguez and the Yankees. Rodriguez brushed aside the Blue Jays' anger, saying the Yankees were "desperate" for a win. "Honestly, I couldn't care less," he said. "They have their opinions. We're looking not to be swept." Rodriguez said he's often heckled by opposing players. "That play happens to me three or four times a week, except it's not at third base, it's over in foul territory by the dugout," Rodriguez said. The Yankees didn't quite know what to think. "I wasn't sure that was allowed," outfielder Johnny Damon said. "If it is, maybe we'll keep on doing it." Said manager Joe Torre: "I don't know what to feel for it. It's not like he said, 'I got it.'" New York took a quick lead against rookie Jesse Litsch (1-2), scoring five times in the first inning. Yankees rookie Tyler Clippard (2-1) gave up three runs and four hits over five innings. Twins 7, White Sox 6 At Minneapolis, Torii Hunter walked with the bases loaded in the ninth inning, forcing in the winning run and lifting the Twins over the struggling White Sox for a three-game sweep. The Twins handed the White Sox their fourth straight loss and moved past Chicago into third place in the AL Central. Mike MacDougal (1-2) took the loss when walked Hunter on four pitches. Joe Nathan (2-1) entered in the ninth and pitched a 1-2-3 inning. Athletics 6, Rangers 1 Dan Haren won his sixth straight decision and Dan Johnson drove in three runs for host Oakland. Haren (6-2) lowered his ERA to an AL-leading 1.64. He gave up four hits in eight innings. Sammy Sosa went 0-for-4 and remained two home runs from becoming the fifth player to reach the 600 mark. Texas called up John Koronka (0-2) from Triple-A Oklahoma to make the start. Devil Rays 5, Tigers 3 James Shields settled after a shaky first inning to throw the second complete game of his career, Elijah Dukes and Brendan Harris backed the right-hander with solo homers for host Tampa Bay. Shields (4-0) yielded three runs and five hits in the opening inning, then allowed just three runners to reach base over the next eight innings. He earned his first win in nearly four weeks. Dukes hit his 10th homer of the season in the fifth and Harris snapped a 3-3 tie against left-hander Nate Robertson (4-5) in the sixth. Indians 8, Red Sox 4 Paul Byrd won his fifth straight decision and extended his streak without issuing a walk to 43 innings, and visiting Cleveland rallied for the win. The loss snapped a five-game winning streak for Boston (36-16), which has the best record in the majors. Cleveland (32-19), with the AL's second best record, avoided being swept in the three-game series. Boston led 2-0 after four innings, but Cleveland tied the game in the fifth and went ahead 6-2 in the sixth against Daisuke Matsuzaka (7-3). Byrd (6-1) has gone six games since his last walk. Royals 3, Orioles 0 Erik Bedard won a matchup of staff aces with Gil Meche and Nick Markakis hit a two-run homer, leading visiting Baltimore to its fifth straight victory. Bedard (4-3) went a season-long eight innings and gave up only four hits, with five strikeouts and two walks. Chris Ray pitched a perfect ninth for his 12th save. Meche (3-4) allowed one run in 7 1-3 innings as Kansas City lost its seventh straight.

(AP) - Jeremy Guthrie wasn&#39;t trying to insult the hapless Kansas City Royals. He was only being honest. "I was missing up, I was throwing breaking balls down. I was up and down and all over the place except where I needed to be," the Baltimore starter said. "Today was a tough day." But fortunately for him, anyone facing Kansas City these days hardly needs his best stuff. A scuffling Guthrie and two relievers combined on a three-hitter last night and led the Orioles to a 6-2 victory, handing the frustrated Royals their sixth straight loss. Guthrie (3-1) went seven innings, and then Chad Bradford and Chris Ray each pitched a scoreless inning of relief. The Royals held a hitters-only meeting before the game - only to have their bats collapse again. In this six-game slide, they&#39;re hitting only .193 and have been outscored 51-14, and manager Buddy Bell is sounding as if he&#39;s out of patience. "It&#39;s time we quit giving the other guys a whole lot of credit," Bell said. "Guthrie had a good fastball. Our swings in this ballpark are a little longer than on the road, for whatever reason." Ramon Hernandez drove in two runs for the Orioles, who won their fourth in a row after losing four of five. "Tonight, I battled through almost every inning, except maybe the seventh and first," said Guthrie, who gave up three hits, with one walk and three strikeouts. Jorge De La Rosa (4-5) gave up eight hits and five runs in five-plus innings. He was relieved after Kevin Millar and Melvin Mora reached beginning the sixth. The Royals took their first lead in a game since Saturday when Mark Teahen homered with two outs in the first. But the lead lasted only until Baltimore scored two in the second on Millar&#39;s solo home run and Hernandez&#39;s RBI single. Hernandez, who hit a grand slam Monday night, also singled home a run in the sixth as the Orioles notched their fourth four-game winning streak. Manager Sam Perlozzo said Guthrie gave him no argument when he pulled him. "He persevered," he said. "There were a couple of innings he just couldn&#39;t get any sink. But he went out and pitched. He was mentally exhausted trying to get back in gear and when he was done, he was done." Shane Costa, placed in the leadoff spot for the first time this year, drove in the Royals&#39; second run with a sacrifice fly in the third. Back-to-back doubles by Miguel Tejada and Aubrey Huff put the Orioles on top 3-1 in the third. With no outs in the sixth, Hernandez grounded a single off reliever Jimmy Gobble just past the outstretched glove of Angel Berroa, making his second start at shortstop. Millar easily scored from third, and Mora raced home from second when left fielder Costa short-hopped the throw into the infield, KC&#39;s first error in six games. Hernandez went to third on Brian Roberts&#39; single and scored when Nick Markakis grounded back to Gobble, who failed to field the ball cleanly and tried an underhanded scoop to the plate that was too late to get the runner. The play was ruled a fielder&#39;s choice. "We caught a break on both those plays," Perlozzo said. Notes: The start of the game was delayed 26 minutes by rain. ... The Orioles committed their league-leading fifth balk.

Hewitt the comeback king Hewitt took almost three hours to defeat former French Open champion Gaston Gaudio [GALLO/GETTY] Lleyton Hewitt came from two sets down to defeat 2004 champion Gaston Gaudio 4-6, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 in a gruelling five-set match in the third round of the French Open on Thursday. Hewitt's stunning comeback victory was the fourth time in his career, and the second time in successive Grand Slams, that he has performed such a turnaround. "He's one of the toughest second round draws you can get here," Hewitt said of his opponent. "At the end of the second set, I was just trying to focus on the third. I wasn't even thinking about the fourth or fifth sets. I needed to keep my focus. "You never know what you are going to get with him. He has ups and downs. I had to make sure that I didn't have any of those downs. "But he's a great shotmaker. I just had to hang in there and try and take my chances when they came up." While the Australian looks forward to a third round clash against Finland's Jarkko Nieminen, the result looks likely to hasten the 28-year-old Gaudio's decision to ponder retirement. "I'm getting used to such a frustrating experience," he said. "I served well in the first two sets. "But he broke my serve in the third game of the third set and after that I couldn't play anymore." The Argentinian, who has slipped to 72 in the world after once reaching as high five, had already expressed his frustration at life on the tour after a dismal 2007 where he has only once won two matches in a row. Hewitt looked destined to suffer his worst performance in Paris since making a first round exit on his debut in 1999 when he went two sets down, with the first going for 62 minutes. The Australian failed to convert any of his four break points before Gaudio, who beat compatriot Guillermo Coria in a memorable five-set 2004 final, soon took a two-set lead. However if anyone was going to stage a comeback, it was Hewitt, and the 14th seed cut back on unforced errors in the third set which he took with breaks in the third and seventh games and then levelled the contest against a ragged Gaudio by snatching the fourth as the Argentinian's game imploded. Hewitt broke in the first and fifth games of the deciding set and took the match with a love service game after three hours and 28 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier when Gaudio hit a lazy, tired forehand long. Hewitt had to come back from two sets down to beat Michael Russell in the first round of this year's Australian Open. His first such dramatic recovery came against Guillermo Canas in the fourth round at Roland Garros in 2001, and the second was in 2003 when he beat Roger Federer in a Davis Cup semi-final.

Click me to Kobe Bryant asks to be traded from Lakers NBA star Kobe Bryant has reportedly asked the Lakers to be traded. Photograph by : CP File Photo John Nadel, The Canadian Press Published: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 LOS ANGELES â€” Kobe Bryant asked to be traded from the Lakers on Wednesday, a day after calling the teamâ€™s front office â€œa mess.â€ He said there was nothing the Lakers could do to change his mind. â€œI would like to be traded, yeah,â€ Bryant told ESPN radio. â€œTough as it is to come to that conclusion, thereâ€™s no other alternative. Itâ€™s rough man, but I donâ€™t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just donâ€™t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.â€ Bryant, who helped the Lakers win three consecutive NBA championships, has four years left on the seven-year, US$136.4-million contract he signed July 15, 2004. That was a day after Shaquille Oâ€™Neal was traded to the Miami Heat. Bryant became infuriated Tuesday when a Los Angeles Times columnist quoted what he called a Lakers insider as saying it was Bryantâ€™s insistence on getting away from Oâ€™Neal that prompted the trade to Miami. Bryant, the NBAâ€™s leading scorer the past two seasons, said he spoke with Phil Jackson on Tuesday, and the coach told him he was being let go because the Lakers were committed to reducing payroll and rebuilding long-term. â€œThey said nothing to me about a long-term plan â€” absolutely nothing,â€ Bryant told KLAC radio, the Lakersâ€™ flagship station. â€œThey told Phil one thing and they told me another. Actions speak louder than words.â€ â€œItâ€™s a trust thing,â€ he added. â€œTheyâ€™re in a long-term plan that I had no idea about.â€ Bryantâ€™s agent, Rob Pelinka, did not respond to several messages left by The Associated Press. Bryant, an 11-year veteran who turns 29 in August, urged the team at seasonâ€™s end to do what it takes to get back into contention. He essentially repeated those comments last weekend in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. On Sunday, he suggested former Lakers general manager Jerry West should return. West left the team in the summer of 2000 and was succeeded by current GM Mitch Kupchak. West, an employee of the Lakers for about 40 years as a player, coach and executive, is under contract as the Memphis Grizzliesâ€™ president until July 1. He turned 69 this week and has remained a close friend of Kupchakâ€™s. West has said he has â€œno plans to seek employment with any other organization.â€ It was West who brought Bryant to the Lakers, trading centre Vlade Divac to Charlotte in the summer of 1996 for the rights to Bryant â€” the 13th pick in the NBA draft. Bryant was only 17 at the time. On Tuesday, Bryant did a series of radio interviews bashing the Lakers. He contended owner Jerry Buss misled him three years ago, saying the team would try immediately to rejoin the NBAâ€™s elite. â€œThat place is a mess,â€ Bryant said, referring to the Lakersâ€™ front office. â€œIf weâ€™re not making strides here to improve this team right now, to be aggressive in that nature, then whatâ€™s the point of having me here?â€ The 74-year-old Buss was arrested Tuesday in Carlsbad for investigation of driving under the influence of alcohol. He was released later in the day. Bryant earned $17.72 million last season and is owed $88.6 million over the next four years. He can terminate his contract following the 2008-09 season â€” a move that would leave $47.8 million on the table. By requesting a trade, Bryant would obviously waive his no-trade clause, but he has a trade clause in his contract that is believed to add about $13 million to his total contract value, a cost to be absorbed by any team that acquires him. That money would be paid like a signing bonus and would not count toward the salary cap. The Lakers had to pay a similar fee to Lamar Odom when they acquired him from Miami three years ago, paying him about $8 million. The Lakers won championships from 2000-02 and reached the NBA final again in 2004, losing to the Detroit Pistons in five games. The team was broken up at that time. Oâ€™Neal was traded, Jackson left and other stalwarts â€” Karl Malone, Gary Payton, Derek Fisher, Robert Horry and Rick Fox â€” went elsewhere or retired. The Lakers failed to make the playoffs the following season. With Jackson returning before the 2005-06 campaign, they finished seventh in the Western Conference in each of the past two years, but were eliminated by Phoenix in the first round of the playoffs. The Lakers appeared to be a title contender through the first half of this season, going 26-13 despite several injuries to key players. But they lost 27 of their last 43 games to finish 42-40 before losing to the Suns in five games. â€œPersonally for me, itâ€™s beyond frustration â€” three years and still being at ground zero,â€ Bryant said a day after the playoffs ended. â€œThis summerâ€™s a big summer. We have to see what direction we want to take as an organization and make those steps and make them now.â€ Bryant has made the all-star team in each of the past nine seasons, clearly establishing himself as an NBA great before age 30. Only one active NBA player, Kevin Garnett, has a longer tenure with one team than Bryant. Garnett has played 12 seasons for Minnesota. The Lakers won 20 playoff series from 2000-04 but have won four post-season games and no series in the past three years. Since Oâ€™Neal left, theyâ€™ve received little from the draft, trades or free agency. Bryant has stated repeatedly in the past that he was a Lakersâ€™ fan since childhood, and wanted to be a Laker for life. But the Oâ€™Neal matter and his feeling of being misled by Buss appear have changed things. â€œThe fact of the matter is that many people donâ€™t know what really went down when I was approaching free agency because I have stayed quiet about it this whole time,â€ Bryant wrote on his website. â€œThe real facts are that Dr. Buss requested a meeting with me during the â€™04 season long before I opted out of my contract, and he told me he had already decided not to extend Shaq, as he was concerned about Shaqâ€™s age, fitness and contract demands. â€œDr. Buss made it clear that his decision was final, his mind was made up, and no matter what I decided to do with free agency, he was still going to move Shaq.â€ Oâ€™Neal said on the Philadelphia Inquirerâ€™s website he believed Bryant â€œ100 per cent.â€ Bryant said he was considering signing with the Clippers and Chicago Bulls three years ago before hearing from Buss. â€œDr. Buss promised me he would rebuild right away, and I believed him,â€ Bryant wrote. â€œThat is why I put my trust in the Lakers. But when stuff like this is coming from the `inside,â€™ all I can do is hope that someone from the `insideâ€™ comes forward to support me and set straight the facts of what really happened.

The Cards will try to tie the four-game midweek series at two wins each in Thursday nightâ€™s finale. In his first-ever MLB start, (0-0, 2.70 as a Card) bested former Houston Astro (2-4, 4.30) on Wednesday night as the 21-29 Cards halted the Rockies' seven-game winning streak and their own three-game skid. Hereâ€™s how they did it. was hit by a pitch and failed to convert with one out in the top of the first inning. However, did not let Hirsh off the ropes. His two-out double into the left field corner scored Taguchi. The rattled rookie uncorked a wild pitch with his very next offering, as finally one of â€™s wild swings did some good, as all the wildness enabled Pujols to dash in from third. Leading off for the Rockies, former Met reached base and promptly stole second, as scorched a ball that almost took Wellemeyerâ€™s head off to put runners on the corners. Matsui scored on a 4-6-3 twin killing to cut the lead to 2-1 Cards. The Cardsâ€™ lead was short-lived as blasted a solo home run into the right field seats to tie the game in the second. The same Rockies keyed a two-out threat in the third. Tulowitzki shot another screamer past Wellemeyer for a single. A hit and run single by Hawpe put runners at the corners. That set the table for , who was retired on a fly ball to left. In the fourth, Edmonds collected a leadoff standup triple as the veteran centerfielder dove and missed his sinking liner. As the ball rolled to the wall, I thought the Edmonds of old might have circled the bases. The next pitch was turned into a one-hopper off the wall in left center â€“ an RBI double by Scott Rolen to retake the lead. The Cards batted around in the fifth. Miles and Taguchi both singled to lead off the inning. Pujols slammed his ninth home run of the year to dead center on the first pitch of his at-bat. Edmonds put the very next offering into the bullpen in right. The pair of 400-plus-foot home runs made the score 7-2. Encarnacion hustled a double to left center with one down. â€™s blast up against the wall. It was just a few feet from being a two-run home run. The Rox gambled by walking Kennedy with first base open, but Wellemeyerâ€™s RBI single blew up the strategy and ended Hirshâ€™s night. He was charged with all eight runs. Matt Holliday homered to start Coloradoâ€™s fifth, which ended Wellemeyerâ€™s night. He allowed three runs on seven hits in five-plus innings. After took over for the seventh. A RBI double charged to Franklin closed the gap to 8-4. Franklin was asked to pitch a second inning, which may or may not have future rotation implications. Holliday singled with one out in the eighth. A wild throw by Kennedy pulled Miles off the second base bag on Heltonâ€™s grounder, so instead of an inning-ending double play, two runners were on. Franklin fanned Atkins before came in to face Hawpe, who took Ryen Ludwick to the wall in right for the catch. That would be the Rockiesâ€™ last threat of the evening. A forgotten man in this series so far, Jason Isrnghausen, closed out the Rockies in the ninth in order. It was a non-save situation. - Closing out the four-game series Thursday night, (3-1, 4.73) faces Aaron Cook (4-1, 4.11). The Cards have their work cut out for them as Cook hasnâ€™t lost in his last seven starts. - With the win Wednesday, the Cardinals took a 68-67 lead over the Rockies in career head-to-head games. The Cards are 34-36 lifetime at Coors Field. - When the big boys hit, the Cards win. Simple as that. The former â€œMV3â€ went 7-for-14 with a walk in Wednesdayâ€™s victory. - Albert Pujols went 2-for-4 with three RBI and two runs scored, including a home run. His average is back up to .296. - Scott Rolen had three hits in Tuesday nightâ€™s game and two more Wednesday. He has hits in seven straight and nine of his last ten contests. His average has climbed to .252 since he started the last homestand on the 22nd at .209. - Jim Edmonds hit his fourth home run in five starts Wednesday night and has had at least one hit in 11 of his last 16 games. Edmonds went 3-for-5 on the evening. - I donâ€™t want to get the cart ahead of the horse, but I have to admit that the photo of Wellemeyer above sort of reminds me of another journeyman and ex-Cubs reliever, turned effective starter in St. Louis, then turned into trade bait.

http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/n/a/2007/05/31/sports/s012337D24.DTL&cid A-Rod, Yankees Snap 5-Game Losing Streak A-Rod, Yankees Snap 5-Game Losing Streak Thursday, May 31, 2007 (05-31) 01:23 PDT , (AP) -- Whatever Alex Rodriguez said, it sure didn't go over well with the Blue Jays. It did, however, help the New York Yankees snap a five-game losing streak. Rodriguez distracted Toronto third baseman Howie Clark by shouting at him on a key popup in the ninth inning, touching off arguments all over the field, and the Yankees beat the Blue Jays 10-5 Wednesday night. "I just said, 'Hah!' That's it," Rodriguez said. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't." "I don't know what my intention was," he said. "I didn't say, 'I got it' or anything like that." Clark claimed Rodriguez called for the ball. "I heard a 'Mine' call and so I let it go," Clark said. "What do you do? It makes you mad." In other AL games it was, Minnesota 7, Chicago 6; Oakland 6, Texas 1; Cleveland 8, Boston 4; Tampa Bay 5, Detroit 3; Baltimore 3, Kansas City 0; and Los Angeles 8, Seattle 6. At Toronto, Rodriguez hit an RBI single with two outs in the ninth that made it 7-5. Jorge Posada followed with a high infield pop and Rodriguez ran hard, cutting between Clark and shortstop John McDonald. Replays showed Rodriguez shouting something, and Clark backed off at the last second. McDonald was only a few steps behind Clark, but couldn't make the catch and ball dropped for an RBI single. After the play, McDonald started jawing with Rodriguez, and third base umpire Chad Fairchild got between them. Blue Jays manager John Gibbons came out to argue, and exchanged words with Rodriguez and third base coach Larry Bowa before leaving the field as plate umpire Eric Cooper intervened. Rodriguez stayed on the bag with a smirk. "The thing about the Yankees, one of the reasons they're so respected, is they do things right. Always have," Gibbons said. "They've got a lot of pride and a lot of class. They play the game hard. "That's not Yankee pride right there. That's not the way they play. I thought it was bush league." Clark said he'd never seen &#8212; or heard &#8212; that play before. "This is my 16th season and it's never happened once," he said. As Jason Giambi stepped up to hit after the popup, he seemed to get into it with catcher Jason Phillips and Cooper settled them down. Giambi followed with a two-run single. When the game ended, many of the Blue Jays stayed on the bench, staring at Rodriguez and the Yankees. Rodriguez brushed aside the Blue Jays' anger, saying the Yankees were "desperate" for a win. "Honestly, I couldn't care less," he said. "They have their opinions. We're looking not to be swept." Rodriguez said he's often heckled by opposing players. "That play happens to me three or four times a week, except it's not at third base, it's over in foul territory by the dugout," Rodriguez said. The Yankees didn't quite know what to think. "I wasn't sure that was allowed," outfielder Johnny Damon said. "If it is, maybe we'll keep on doing it." Said manager Joe Torre: "I don't know what to feel for it. It's not like he said, 'I got it.'" New York took a quick lead against rookie Jesse Litsch (1-2), scoring five times in the first inning. Yankees rookie Tyler Clippard (2-1) gave up three runs and four hits over five innings. Twins 7, White Sox 6 At Minneapolis, Torii Hunter walked with the bases loaded in the ninth inning, forcing in the winning run and lifting the Twins over the struggling White Sox for a three-game sweep. The Twins handed the White Sox their fourth straight loss and moved past Chicago into third place in the AL Central. Mike MacDougal (1-2) took the loss when walked Hunter on four pitches. Joe Nathan (2-1) entered in the ninth and pitched a 1-2-3 inning. Athletics 6, Rangers 1 Dan Haren won his sixth straight decision and Dan Johnson drove in three runs for host Oakland. Haren (6-2) lowered his ERA to an AL-leading 1.64. He gave up four hits in eight innings. Sammy Sosa went 0-for-4 and remained two home runs from becoming the fifth player to reach the 600 mark. Texas called up John Koronka (0-2) from Triple-A Oklahoma to make the start. Devil Rays 5, Tigers 3 James Shields settled after a shaky first inning to throw the second complete game of his career, Elijah Dukes and Brendan Harris backed the right-hander with solo homers for host Tampa Bay. Shields (4-0) yielded three runs and five hits in the opening inning, then allowed just three runners to reach base over the next eight innings. He earned his first win in nearly four weeks. Dukes hit his 10th homer of the season in the fifth and Harris snapped a 3-3 tie against left-hander Nate Robertson (4-5) in the sixth. Indians 8, Red Sox 4 Paul Byrd won his fifth straight decision and extended his streak without issuing a walk to 43 innings, and visiting Cleveland rallied for the win. The loss snapped a five-game winning streak for Boston (36-16), which has the best record in the majors. Cleveland (32-19), with the AL's second best record, avoided being swept in the three-game series. Boston led 2-0 after four innings, but Cleveland tied the game in the fifth and went ahead 6-2 in the sixth against Daisuke Matsuzaka (7-3). Byrd (6-1) has gone six games since his last walk. Royals 3, Orioles 0 Erik Bedard won a matchup of staff aces with Gil Meche and Nick Markakis hit a two-run homer, leading visiting Baltimore to its fifth straight victory. Bedard (4-3) went a season-long eight innings and gave up only four hits, with five strikeouts and two walks. Chris Ray pitched a perfect ninth for his 12th save. Meche (3-4) allowed one run in 7 1-3 innings as Kansas City lost its seventh straight. Angels 8, Mariners 6 At Anaheim, Calif., Vladimir Guerrero hit a three-run homer off Felix Hernandez (3-3) and the Angels' bullpen preserved the lead in a win over Seattle. Dustin Moseley (4-0) got the win in relief of starter Jered Weaver, who was pulled after 4 2-3 innings. Francisco Rodriguez worked the ninth for his 18th save in 19 chances.

Samuel Pahlsson's goal in the 3rd period was all Anaheim needed in the 1-0 win. Late in the third period Ducks forward Samuel Pahlsson pounced on a neutral zone turnover, raced into the Senators zone and, using Ottawa blueliner Joe Corvo as a screen, fired a hard shot that beat Sens goalie Ray Emery to the stick side for the winner.

Rob Niedermayer, Teemu Selanne, Corey Perry and Ryan Getzlaf had three or more shots. Their checking forwards, particularly Pahlsson and Niedermayer, did a terrific job defensively in shutting down the Senators forwards for the second straight game. Anaheim's blueliners used their physical advantage to once again neutralize the Senators' scoring forwards at even strength, particularly by clearing rebounds and blocking shots. Chris Pronger, Scott Niedermayer and Francois Beachemin again logged big minutes and were instrumental in keeping the Senators off the board. Of the four times the Ducks were penalized, only one was assessed to a defenseman (Pronger), indicative of the more-disciplined effort by their defensemen in shutting down their opponents. For the second straight game, Jean-Sebastien Giguere wasn't tested very much, facing only 16 shots, but came up big on the few scoring chances the Senators had on him. The Ducks again failed to score on the power play but their penalty killers were more effective in this game by shutting down Ottawa's power play. They also outdrew the Senators in the faceoff circle 30-21. Samuel Pahlsson, for both his superb job in checking Ottawa's top line as well as scoring the game's only goal. The only minor point in an otherwise superb performance by the Ducks is their continued inability to score on the power play, but if they keep playing as well throughout the remainder of the series as they did in Game 2, it probably won't matter. For the second straight game, the Senators top line of Daniel Alfredsson, Jason Spezza and Dany Heatley were unable to score. In fact, this was unquestionably that line's worst performance of the playoffs. They got no help from their secondary scorers. Ottawa's forwards keep losing the battles along the boards, failed to generate enough scoring pressure on the Ducks and appeared unable to drive to the net against the Ducks physical defense. They again failed to get the puck deep into the Anaheim zone and win the footraces to the pucks. For the second straight game the Senators blueliners struggled against the physical forechecking of the Ducks, coughing up the puck, failing to clear their zone or generate breakout passes, or win the battles along the boards and in front of their net. Offensively they were unable to get enough pucks through on their point shots. If not for Ray Emery, the Senators would've been blown out of the building. He again faced lots of rubber, stopping 30 of 31 shots, and had no chance on the Pahlsson goal, as he was screened by his defenseman. He did his best for the second straight game to give his team a chance to win. Their penalty killing remains one of their few bright spots in this series, effectively killing off four Anaheim power plays. Their own power play, however, came up snake eyes in this game. Everywhere except in goal and on the penalty kill. The Ducks dominated the Senators, who actually played worse in this game than in Game 1. They can't use the long layoff prior to this series as an excuse for this stinker. They played more physically in this game, but they came up short everywhere else. The Ducks have taken away Ottawa's speed advantage and if they can't regain it as well as improve the rest of their game, this series could be a short one.

A-Rod makes himself heard Johnny Damon is greeted by Alex Rodriguez after leading off the game with a home run. A-Rod later found himself in the middle of another controversy. (MIKE CASSESE/REUTERS) By Associated Press | Alex Rodriguez helped the New York Yankees end their five-game losing streak with his bat -- and his mouth. Rodriguez distracted Toronto third baseman Howie Clark on a key popup late in the game, touching off arguments all over the field, and the Yankees beat the Blue Jays, 10-5, last night in Toronto. Rodriguez hit an RBI single with two outs in the ninth that made it 7-5. Jorge Posada followed with a high infield pop and Rodriguez ran hard, cutting between Clark and shortstop John McDonald. Replays showed Rodriguez shouting something, and Clark backed off at the last second. McDonald was only a few steps behind Clark, but couldn't make the catch and the ball dropped for an RBI single. "I just said, 'Hah!' That's it," Rodriguez said. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't." McDonald started jawing with Rodriguez, and third base umpire Chad Fairchild got between them. Toronto manager John Gibbons came out to argue and exchanged words with Rodriguez and third base coach Larry Bowa before leaving the field as plate umpire Eric Cooper intervened. Rodriguez stayed on the bag with a smirk. When Jason Giambi stepped up to hit, he seemed to get into it with catcher Jason Phillips and Cooper settled them down. Giambi followed with a two-run single. When the game ended, many of the Blue Jays stayed on the bench, staring at Rodriguez and the Yankees. "They have their opinions," Rodriguez said, adding he pulled the trick to help the Yankees "win a game. We're desperate." Rodriguez said three or four times each week, opponents shout at him while he pursues foul pops near their dugout. "It's not like he said, 'I got it,' " Yankees manager Joe Torre said. Johnny Damon led off with a home run for the Yankees, who avoided falling nine games under .500 for the first time since they were 20-29 after play June 20, 1995, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. New York took a quick lead against rookie Jesse Litsch (1-2), scoring five times in the first inning. Yankees rookie Tyler Clippard (2-1) gave up three runs and four hits over five innings. Angels 8, Mariners 6 -- Vladimir Guerrero hit a go-ahead, three-run homer and Francisco Rodriguez notched his 18th save in 19 chances for host Los Angeles. Devil Rays 5, Tigers 3 -- James Shields (4-0) settled down after a shaky first inning to throw the second complete game of his career, and Elijah Dukes and Brendan Harris backed the righthander with solo homers for host Tampa Bay. Orioles 3, Royals 0 -- Erik Bedard won a matchup of staff aces with Gil Meche and Nick Markakis hit a two-run homer, leading Baltimore past host Kansas City for the Orioles' fifth-straight win. Athletics 6, Rangers 1 -- Dan Haren (6-2) won his sixth straight decision and Dan Johnson drove in three runs for host Oakland. Phillies 4, Diamondbacks 3 -- At Philadelphia, 43-year-old Randy Johnson (4-3) returned from tendinitis to toss one-hit, shutout ball over six innings, and Eric Byrnes homered twice to lead Arizona to its seventh straight win. Former Seattle teammates Johnson and the 44-year-old Jamie Moyer (5-4) combined to set a record for the matchup of the oldest lefties in history. At a combined 88 years 90 days, Johnson and Moyer broke the record set the last time these two faced off in early May. Braves 9, Brewers 3 -- Brian McCann hit a go-ahead, three-run double in a seven-run eighth inning, and Atlanta sent host Milwaukee to its seventh loss in eight games. Reds 4, Astros 3 -- Aaron Harang (6-2) pitched a six-hitter for his first complete game of the season, and Cincinnati handed host Houston its 10th consecutive loss. Dodgers 5, Nationals 0 -- Derek Lowe (5-5) pitched seven scoreless innings, reached base three times, and scored once as Los Angeles shut out host Washington for the second straight game. Marlins 9, Cubs 0 -- Dan Uggla homered twice, and Miguel Cabrera and Josh Willingham went deep to lead Florida at Chicago. Giants 3, Mets 0 -- Barry Zito (5-5) outpitched Tom Glavine (5-3) over seven sharp innings and San Francisco snapped a four-game losing streak with a win at New York. Cardinals 8, Rockies 4 -- Todd Wellemeyer earned a victory in his first major league start and Albert Pujols and Jim Edmonds hit back-to-back homers in the fifth to help St. Louis end host Colorado's seven-game winning streak.

Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Bedard throws down aces as Orioles win By DOUG TUCKER AP Sports Writer Article Launched: 05/30/2007 09:35:48 PM PDT Click photo to enlarge Baltimore Orioles' Nick Markakis watches his ball after hitting a two-run home run during the ninth inning of a baseball game against the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday, May 30, 2007, in Kansas City, Mo. The Orioles won 3-0, sweeping the Royals in a three-game series. KANSAS CITY, Mo.- Giving up only eight earned runs in his previous 34 innings hadn't produced a win, so Erik Bedard took the next logical step. He didn't give up any runs at all. Outpitching Kansas City's Gil Meche, Bedard allowed four hits in eight innings Wednesday night and led Baltimore to a 3-0 victory, the fifth straight win for the Orioles and the seventh loss in a row for the hapless Royals. "It's always tough when it's 0-0 late in the game," Bedard said. "But you just stay in there and battle and good things will happen." Winless since April 18, Bedard (4-3) had five strikeouts and two walks in his longest outing of the season. Only one runner got past second against the left-hander. Jay Payton broke up the scoreless duel with an RBI single in the eighth and Nick Markakis, inserted into right field for defensive purposes, hit a two-run homer in the ninth off Zack Greinke. Meche (3-4) bounced back from his worst outing of the year to throw one of his best games since joining Kansas City. "Gil was terrific," said Royals' manager Buddy Bell, who was ejected in the top of the eighth for arguing with Marty Foster after the home plate umpire had thrown out Emil Brown for arguing a called third strike. "It's hard to win when you don't score any runs," Bell said. "He gave us what we needed, but we couldn't do anything with Bedard." After matching Bedard with seven shutout innings, Meche departed when Payton grounded an RBI single through the hole into left with one out in the eighth. The right-hander gave up four hits and one run in 7 1-3 innings. He walked four and had five strikeouts after allowing seven runs and 11 hits in 4 1-3 innings his previous start. "Coming out of a slump against Bedard is not an easy thing to do," Meche said. "He just beat us." Chris Ray pitched a perfect ninth for his 12th save in 15 chances. Rain delayed the game at the start 1 hour, 36 minutes, then the pitchers did their best to get the fans home quickly. The game took 2:31. It had been so long since his last win, Bedard said he couldn't remember when it happened. "I know it was a long time ago," he said. But frustration, he added, is "part of the game." "It happened the first two years. It happened last year. It happens every year," he said. "You go through a span where you don't win for four or five games in a row, then you win five in a row. It's part of the game." Ramon Hernandez walked leading off the eighth for the Orioles, whose five-game winning streak is their longest of the season. Corey Patterson was safe at first when he laid down a bunt and beat the throw to the bag. The runners moved up on Brian Roberts' sacrifice bunt, and then Payton's single broke the scoreless tie. Greinke came in for Meche and struck out the next two batters, Miguel Tejada and Aubrey Huff, on six pitches, but surrendered a single to Kevin Millar ahead of Markakis' home run. Meche's lower back had tightened up in his previous start, rendering him ineffective. But facing a Baltimore lineup which had scored 31 runs and hit .315 while winning four in a row, he was dominant for seven innings. Mora singled leading off the second, then the right-hander retired 16 in a row before walking Roberts to lead off the sixth. The seven-game skid is the longest of the year for the Royals, who again have reclaimed the worst record in the majors. In getting swept three games by the Orioles, the Royals managed only three runs and 12 hits. They now begin a seven-game road trip to Tampa Bay and Cleveland. "They're all frustrated," Bell said of his players. "And I'm right there with them." Notes:@ Baltimore LHP Jamie Walker was passing out cigars celebrating the birth of his fourth child. He'd been away for two days to be with wife Natalie. ... Bell hadn't been thrown out of a game since April 9 at Toronto.

The best minutes of the meeting occurred soon after Barry Zito had banked the Giants' 3-0 win over Tom Glavine and the Mets. Zito, a couple of weeks past his 29th birthday and now the winner of 107 games, was asked whether he could relate to the 41-year-old Glavine's 295. "I have to relate to his big-league service time first," said Zito, grinning. "That's a long run, man. He's been on the field and staying healthy forever. "The wins are impressive and amazing, but if you can stay healthy that many years and compete, my hat's off to him." Across the bowels of the ballpark, Glavine's hat also came off. "He pitches," Glavine said of Zito, that starkest of compliments which is the highest praise inside clubhouse walls. "He changes speeds and locations. He isn't a guy who is overpowering, but those are the guys I love to watch. "I just wish I didn't have to watch him against me." From everywhere except possibly the Mets' dugout, the view was impressive, as Zito pitched the first seven innings of the first shutout of the Mets in 56 games, since Sept. 26, 2006. When Zito became a free agent in October following a 102-63 run in Oakland, many assumed his rock-star bearings would lead him to New York. This was a place, they reasoned, where he would enjoy pitching. Well, no kidding. ... Wednesday night brought his first opportunity to pitch in Flushing, and he certainly appeared to enjoy the occasion. Showing up the Mets, however, was not part of his agenda. The Mets' offseason pursuit ended with their decision that the left-hander did not merit the $126 million price (over seven seasons) eventually paid by the Giants. "I don't want to pitch with any vendetta," said Zito, slowly shaking his head. "For me, it's just being aggressive and throwing strikes and hoping for the best." Zito even enjoyed the pregame as much as the game. Running around in the outfield before entering the bullpen to warm up, he received the verbal bouquets of Mets fans. "It's always great to come to New York and get all those trash-talkers who were on me in the outfield today," Zito said, "saying everything they could think of. "No, they weren't creative at all. Just throwing blatant expletives right at me." Soon enough, Zito was throwing quality stuff at those fans' heroes. Enough quality stuff to bar Glavine's road to 296, and to leave his elder shrugging shoulders in resignation. In the aftermath, Glavine was cornered into explaining defeat. But he hadn't lost; allow three runs in seven innings, and you've done a job worthy of a "W." Except, Zito wouldn't let him win. Glavine retraced a maddening first inning of one line-drive hit to the outfield -- by Barry Bonds, which the pitcher degraded to "semi-line drive to the outfield" -- and a couple of others dribbled through the infield, including a two-run single by Pedro Feliz. Feliz's single was huge, and effectively brought the night to a premature conclusion. Because, San Francisco's pitcher is a walking contradiction to that romantic notion that baseball games slowly build toward climax. Glavine's rationale -- "I'm always going to give up runs, so I just got them out of the way earlier" -- was sound, with one major exception. Zito simply does not surrender leads. Not even modest ones. In 50 starts since the beginning of the 2005 season, he now is 33-4 when given at least two runs. Which Feliz's roller under shortstop Jose Reyes' diving glove did. "I had to make those early runs work," Zito said. "I knew Glavine has been tough." Indeed, if not for tough luck, Glavine wouldn't have any luck at all. At his current pace, he will participate in one memorable game after another, while remaining stuck on 295 wins. In his previous start, he had dropped a 2-1 gem to John Smoltz, his onetime swing man on the Braves posse. Now this whitewash by Zito, one of the worthy successors to the left-handed throne he occupies. "Maybe," Glavine said, those ground hits still bouncing around in his mind, "I've got to get them to hit the ball harder." Satisfaction in one room, frustration in the other ... and nothing but admiration down the middle. It was a remarkable evening, when one remembers that Glavine won his first of 295 when Zito was a nine-year-old in third grade. On Wednesday night, the generations fused into a remarkable duel. Glavine is chasing 300, and Zito may never get too far on the other side of 200. The hill is just too steep, the way his craft has changed. But for one night, at least, they were peers. And as a tandem, they were peerless. is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.

Belisle (5-4) allowed only two hits after Adam Everett's RBI triple that was nearly an inside-the-park homer. Belisle, a native of Austin, threw 102 pitches in 7 2/3 innings, his longest outing since a complete-game victory over Pittsburgh on April 28. Adam Dunn knocked in a run with a sacrifice fly for the Reds, who won on the road for the third time in their last 12 games away from home. David Weathers got Carlos Lee to ground into a game-ending double play with the bases loaded in the ninth to pick up his 10th save. Jason Jennings gave up three hits with three strikeouts in his first start for Houston since April 8. Jennings was on the disabled list with tendinitis in his right throwing elbow. Chad Qualls (4-2) replaced Brad Lidge to start the seventh and took the loss. The Astros have lost nine in a row for the first time since September 1996. They lost to the Reds for just the third time in 10 meetings. Craig Biggio doubled with two outs in the second and scored the Astros' only run. Everett hit a sinking liner to center and the ball skidded past Norris Hopper when he couldn't make a diving catch. Hopper chased down the ball and hit Brandon Phillips with a relay throw as Everett rounded third. The throw home to Chad Moeller was high, but the catcher swiped the sliding Everett for the out at the plate. Jennings retired nine in a row after giving up three hits and walking two in the first two innings. He struck out Moeller and Belisle to end the fifth and was finished after 79 pitches. Rick White relieved to start the sixth and gave up a double to Hopper and a single to Hatteberg. Left-hander Trever Miller came on and walked Ken Griffey Jr. to load the bases. Lidge, who hadn't pitched since bruising his knee in San Francisco on May 21, replaced Miller and struck out Phillips. Dunn then flew out to deep center to score Hopper and tie it at 1. With one out in the eighth, Hatteberg hammered Qualls' 2-0 pitch into the Astros' bullpen in right center. It was Hatteberg's fifth homer of the season and his second in three days. He hit career homer No. 100 against Pittsburgh on Saturday. Diamondbacks 11, Phillies 5: PHILADELPHIA - Orlando Hudson had four hits and drove in four runs, Micah Owings pitched five effective innings Tuesday night to lead Arizona over Philadelphia 11-5, the Diamondbacks' sixth straight victory. Pirates 4, Padres 1: PITTSBURGH - Tom Gorzelanny scattered seven hits over seven innings to lead Pittsburgh, which won for the fourth time in five games. Gorzelanny (6-3), who gave up one run, entered the game third in the NL with a 2.51 ERA. He lowered that to 2.39.

After catching a shutout for the second consecutive night, Martin was barely asked about the two-run homer he slugged in support of Derek Lowe's 5-0 win over the Nationals on Wednesday night. When the questioning implied that the Dodgers can't be an elite team with a "weak" offense, Martin politely dissented. "If you say it like that, yeah, I'm part of that offense, so I take it a little personally," he said. "It's not just our pitching that's winning games. Pitching has held us together this year, but we've got guys that have hit for a lot of years. I don't think that's a problem here. I've got lot of confidence in our hitters. We're going to be OK. "People can say whatever they want, but we're a good hitting team. We don't have that one big power hitter -- a [Albert] Pujols or a Ryan Howard -- but we've got guys who can hit 20 homers. Add them up and we've got some power." Martin's fourth homer of the year cleared the center-field fence. He hit 10 last year while spending the first month of the season in the Minor Leagues. "The most I've ever hit are 15, but I've got the power to hit home runs," Martin said. "It's an approach. I'm sure I could hit more, but my average (.303) would drop more. It's just hitting them when you need to." Luis Gonzalez, whose six home runs are second to Jeff Kent's eight, had a pair of hits and scored the Dodgers' first run. "We're starting to swing the bats well throughout the lineup," Gonzalez said. "Everybody critiques about our power outage, but we have guys that put the ball in play and make things happen. Our two leadoff hitters on top create havoc for the other team and open holes for the rest of us hitters. We have professional hitters up and down. When they put this team together, they knew what they were getting. We may not look like superstars, but we grind it out and play hard." Of course, there's always the pitching. Lowe allowed three singles over seven innings, and the only Nationals baserunner to reach second base did so on an error. Following Brad Penny's 10-0 victory the previous night, Lowe and relievers Joe Beimel and Rudy Seanez pitched the Dodgers to consecutive shutouts for the first time in exactly three years (May 29-30 against Arizona). Penny and Lowe have not been scored upon in each of their last two starts covering 26 1/3 innings. Randy Wolf has allowed two runs in his last two starts (13 innings). Jason Schmidt could return from the disabled list in a week to 10 days, further strengthening the rotation. Lowe came away from this a .500 pitcher (5-5), and talk about a deceptive record. In his five losses, the Dodgers have scored only seven runs. Now in his five wins, he's allowed only six earned runs. He has eight quality starts in 12 outings and his ERA is down to 3.32. He's allowed only two home runs compared to 14 last year. Despite that, Lowe said this one was "a struggle." He walked two, but went deep enough in counts to throw 112 pitches. "I've pitched better this year and not gotten as good results," Lowe said. "The defense played extremely well, Nomar [Garciaparra] made four or five tremendous plays. Russell stayed with me and did a good job of coaxing me through it. Early on, my stuff wasn't there and I had to grind it out. The outs weren't coming easy. "In games like this, it's good that it was zero-zero for so long [through four innings] because it made me concentrate harder on every single pitch. As the game went on, it seemed to get better. The offense gave me a big lift with the four runs." Following Penny's 2-for-2 night at the plate, Lowe also got involved in the offense with a single and a pair of walks, prolonging the two-run fifth inning with one of them off Mike Bacsik and starting the seventh-inning rally with the other, then scoring on Garciaparra's single off the foot of pitcher Saul Rivera. "There's a lot of pressure on Mark tomorrow. Hopefully he can get his first hit of the year," Lowe said of Thursday night starter Mark Hendrickson. Garciaparra, whose home run drought reached 146 at-bats, fielded five balls hit his way, robbing Nook Logan of extra bases in the second inning and likely saving the shutout. So what if the Dodgers cannot trade for a power hitter between now and the trade deadline? Will it be enough to load up on pitching and create runs any which way? "Absolutely," said Lowe. "It's National League baseball, pitching and defense wins. And last year, Penny didn't start a game in the playoffs. Look at the way he's pitching, who would want to face him? If he starts twice in a best-of-five series, I'd take my chances with that." is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.

CARUSO Associated Press Writer &copy; 2007 The Associated Press NEW YORK &mdash; The days of seeking out ticket-scalpers in the shadows, ducking into alleys and dodging police for that elusive Yankees-Red Sox seat are fading fast. New York is poised this week to become the latest state to ease or eliminate decades-old restrictions on scalping. For the first time, it would become entirely legal in the state for average fans to scalp their seats on the Internet. And, for better or worse, they could sell those tickets at what ever price the market is willing to bear. The state assembly approved the changes Tuesday. The Senate is expected to follow suit, and Gov. Eliot Spitzer could sign the measure by Friday, when the state's old anti-scalping law expires. "If you have something to sell, you should be able to sell it for what it is truly worth," said Sean Pate, spokesman for the online ticket broker StubHub Inc., which lobbied hard for the change. Some old regulations would stay in place. Scalpers would still be banned from selling tickets within 1,500 feet of large arenas, like Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium, and within 500 feet of smaller venues. Large-volume brokers would still need to get a license, too. It's those brokers who have Russ Haven of the New York Public Interest Research Group worried. Haven argues that lifting the price caps will only prompt greedy opportunists to snap up every available seat, and then jack up prices. "I think this is a bum deal for consumers," Haven said. "As it is, seats to popular events are often selling for 10 times their face price." "It may be that there will be some portion of tickets that go for less than face value, but that's not what they're all banking on," he said of the brokers and ticket agencies pushing for change. Other states have also reconsidered anti-scalping laws. Minnesota tossed its old anti-scalping laws this spring. The state previously allowed tickets to be resold only at face value. A bill that would ease Missouri's ban on selling tickets to sporting events at more than face value passed the legislature and is now before the governor. Illinois and Florida also recently did away with old anti-scalping rules, and bills to ease restrictions are under discussion in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The shift has been propelled in part by the explosion of Internet ticket sales that has made it nearly impossible for states to enforce price caps. New York's old rule limiting a seller's profits to no more than 45 percent over face value has been widely ignored online. But perhaps the biggest change was a switch in business strategy by some of the sports and entertainment companies that previously fought scalping the hardest: Realizing that a multibillion-dollar market was being left untapped, a growing number of teams and theaters have been entering the secondary ticket market themselves. The NCAA signed a deal last year to resell tournament tickets through RazorGator.com. The NBA and some NFL teams have made Ticketmaster their official reseller under an agreement that gives teams a percentage of the profit when a seat is resold. "There is obviously a business opportunity here for us," said Ticketmaster vice president Joseph Freeman. Yet to be seen is how much control sports teams, theaters and concert halls will retain over the tickets being resold. Some have pushed for legislation that would limit reselling to venue-approved brokerages, in part to cut down on the possibility of fraud. Both the New York Yankees and their archrival Boston Red Sox recently made a practice of cracking down on season ticket holders caught selling their unwanted seats on the Internet, in violation of team policy. New York's new rules, if signed in their current form, would actually ban New York sports teams from taking such punitive action. "My feeling is, if I have a ticket, and I can't go to a ballgame, I should certainly have a right to give it to my brother or my cousin &mdash; and if they want to pay me for it, why should I have to go through the Yankees to do it?" state Sen. Dean G. Skelos said.

Give the Gift of SI Faces in the Crowd Grizzlies hire Iavaroni as new coach Posted: Wednesday May 30, 2007 3:31PM; Updated: Wednesday May 30, 2007 3:31PM By Jack McCallum, SI.com have hired Phoenix assistant Marc Iavaroni as their new head coach, SI.com has learned. An official announcement is expected Thursday. Iavaroni was widely considered to be the Grizzlies' top choice after nothing came out of an early interview between the club and Larry Brown. Iavaroni and Dave Griffin, the Suns' vice president, were considered to be a package deal, but the Grizzlies had not hired Griffin for a front-office role as of Wednesday morning. The Suns reportedly want Griffin to stay on through the draft, which might discourage Memphis' interest in him as it tries to replace team president Jerry West, who will leave at the end of June. Iavaroni was schooled in the control system of Pat Riley in Miami, where he was an assistant coach, and is widely recognized as a defensive specialist, though Iavaroni has said he has come to appreciate the up-tempo offense run by Suns coach Mike D'Antoni.

NEW YORK - Barry Zito had the New York Mets on his short list when he was looking at teams as a free agent in the offseason. He opted for a big deal with the San Francisco Giants, insisting it was nothing personal. He sure looked composed against the Mets on Wednesday night, outpitching Tom Glavine over seven sharp innings to help the Giants snap a four-game losing streak with a 3-0 victory. â€œI donâ€™t really want to pitch with any kind of vendetta against people,â€ Zito said of facing New York. â€œYou know for me itâ€™s just about being aggressive and throwing strikes and hope for the best.â€ Pedro Feliz drove in three runs and Rich Aurilia tied a career high with four hits for the Giants, who bounced back from a difficult loss in the series opener against New York. The Mets won 5-4 in 12 innings Tuesday night when Armando Benitez balked in the tying run and surrendered a game-ending homer to Carlos Delgado. â€œThatâ€™s a tough one, losing in extra innings, especially when you have the lead,â€ Giants manager Bruce Bochy said, â€œand to bounce back, play well, get a win, thatâ€™s huge for the club.â€ Paul Lo Duca had two hits for New York, which had won four straight. It was the first time the Mets had been shut out this season. Glavine went seven innings but was denied in his second attempt at career win No. 296. â€œIt was just a streak of bad luck early in the game,â€ Glavine said. Lo Duca led off the seventh with a double for his 1,000th career hit but Zito retired the next three batters, striking out pinch-hitter Julio Franco to end the inning. Zito (5-5) turned in his second consecutive strong outing after struggling in back-to-back starts earlier this month. He gave up 13 runs and 12 hits in 10 innings in outings at Colorado and Oakland, then allowed one run in seven innings in a win over Houston in his last start. Zito, who beat the Mets for the second time this season, said he tried to be too fine against Oakland. â€œYouâ€™ve just got to throw at these guys and be aggressive in the zone, let them get themselves out instead of trying to be too perfect,â€ said Zito, who left the Athletics for a $126 million, seven-year deal with San Francisco. â€œThatâ€™s kind of been my approach the last couple days.â€ He struck out a season-high seven against the Mets, holding them to six hits and one walk. Jack Taschner tossed a perfect eighth and Brad Hennessey got three outs for his second save. Barry Bonds returned to the lineup for the Giants, went 1-for-3 with a walk and remains 10 shy of breaking Hank Aaronâ€™s career record of 755 homers. He was booed lustily each time he came to the plate. Bonds entered with a .329 batting average and four homers in 100 career plate appearances against Glavine, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He hit a two-out single to center against him in the first inning to put runners on first and second. After Bengie Molina walked, Feliz grounded a two-run single into left field. Slide show: Week in Sports Pictures Week in Sports Pictures Sports fans riot and show their elfin side, while flips, turns and wipeouts punctuate motor sports this week. â€œYouâ€™ve got to be very patient,â€ Bonds said about facing Glavine. â€œThe bottom line is if youâ€™re not patient, heâ€™s going to kill you. But if he makes a mistake, Iâ€™m going to kill him. If he doesnâ€™t make a mistake, heâ€™s going to win.â€ Bonds bounced into a double play in the third before Molina singled to right to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. Feliz then tripled off the wall in right-center to make it 3-0. Glavine (5-3) intentionally walked Bonds in the fifth and got him to groundout to first to end the seventh on his 122nd and final pitch of the game. He allowed nine hits, walked two and struck out four. â€œI thought he pitched pretty well,â€ Mets manager Willie Randolph said. â€œThey found some holes. We felt we could score some runs but once Zito got in a groove it was tough.â€ Mets reliever Guillermo Mota was activated after serving the 50th and final game of his suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance. He relieved Glavine to start the eighth and received a mixed reaction of boos and cheers from the home crowd. â€œIt was nice to be back,â€ said Mota, who threw two scoreless innings Giants SS Omar Vizquel made two slick, barehanded plays in the first four innings. ... The Mets optioned RHP Ambiorix Burgos to Triple-A New Orleans to make room for Mota on the roster. ... Philadelphia, Detroit and Baltimore are the only three teams in the majors that havenâ€™t been shut out this season. ...

DUBLIN, Ohio - Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus were side by side on the practice range Wednesday, the two most prolific major champions in golf who looked nothing alike except for the sweat pouring off their faces on a steamy day at Muirfield Village. Nicklaus was warming up for the pro-am, the closest he gets to competition these days. Woods was shaking off rust as he tries to win for the fourth time this year, with one eye on the U.S. Open in two weeks. There are amazing parallels in their careers, from green jackets at Augusta National to the two claret jugs at St. Andrews. They were the youngest of their eras to complete the career Grand Slam. Both were 30 when their fathers died, and both went on to win the British Open that summer. Perhaps the most glaring difference was their rivals. Nicklaus had rivals with staying power that stretched over two decades, from Arnold Palmer to Gary Player, Lee Trevino to Tom Watson. Woodsâ€™ rivals seem to come and go like fashion trends â€” David Duval in 1999, Phil Mickelson in 2001, Ernie Els in 2002, Vijay Singh in 2004, nobody in 2000. After his pro-am round at the Memorial, Woods recalled talking to Nicklaus about rivalries. â€œHe said that as long as youâ€™re part of the conversation over 20 years,â€ Woods said with a smile, â€œthen youâ€™re doing all right.â€ Mickelson has joined the conversation again. A week after Woods won the Wachovia Championship, Mickelson won The Players Championship. They are 1-2 in the world ranking and on the PGA Tour money list. Both return to action this week at the Memorial, which has a 107-man field with the focus squarely on two players. â€œHeâ€™s playing better, no doubt about that,â€ Woods said. Mickelson has 31 victories on the PGA Tour â€” no one has more among active players except Woods â€” and now is working with Butch Harmon, the celebrated swing coach who refined and then retooled Woodsâ€™ swing at the start of his career. Of all the rivalries Woods has faced, this is the most natural, even he says that his biggest rival is himself. Slide show: Week in Sports Pictures Week in Sports Pictures Sports fans riot and show their elfin side, while flips, turns and wipeouts punctuate motor sports this week. â€œI keep pushing myself pretty hard regardless,â€ he said. â€œI always try and get better. You canâ€™t stay stagnant in any sport. Youâ€™ve always got to keep getting better, because you know the guys are training harder; theyâ€™re refining their game.â€ Asked about their renewed rivalry, Mickelson said it was flattering. â€œTo me, anyway,â€ he quickly added. â€œProbably not to him, but itâ€™s flattering to me.â€ Mickelson began working with Harmon right before the Byron Nelson Championship at the end of April, and the results have been on the upswing. He was third at the Nelson, third at Wachovia and won The Players. With the U.S. Open approaching, former U.S. Open champion Johnny Miller gives Mickelson the edge.

Baseball roundup: Tuesday's action on the diamonds Baseball roundup: Tuesday's action on the diamonds May 30, 2007 - 1:16 Pittsburgh Pirates' Freddie Sanchez, right, is tagged out by San Diego Padres second baseman Oscar Robles as he tries to advance to second after hitting an RBI single in the third inning. (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic) (CP) - Jason Bay followed up his award-winning week with another big game. Hours after being named the National League's player of the week, the native of Trail, B.C., had two hits, including his eighth homer, in the Pittsburgh Pirates' 4-1 win over the San Diego Padres on Tuesday. It was Bay's hit his third homer in his past five games. He's 12-for-24 with three home runs and 11 RBIs in his past seven games. And with the Pirates winning, his recent excellent play means that much more. "A lot of times in the past you go on a little hot streak, and it doesn't mean as much because you're not winning," Bay said. "This has coincided with us winning so I think it means a little bit more." Elsewhere in the NL it was: Arizona 11 Philadelphia 5, Los Angeles 10 Washington 0, New York 5 San Francisco 4 (12 innings), Florida 9 Chicago 4, Cincinnati 2 Houston 1, Milwaukee 5 Atlanta 4 and Colorado 8 St. Louis 3. At Pittsburgh, Tom Gorzelanny lowered his ERA to 2.39 after overcoming a shaky first inning. Bay acknowledged that the left-hander is Pittsburgh's leader on the mound. "I'm not going to say he came out of nowhere," Bay said, "but he's our bona fide guy right now. He's our stopper. It's nice to have that guy that goes out there every single day and you're thinking he's going to throw a gem and give you a chance to win." Josh Bard went 3-for-4 and Jose Cruz had two hits for the Padres, who had won three in a row and six of seven. Gorzelanny (6-3) scattered seven hits while allowing the one run, striking out four and walking three as the Pirates won for the fourth time in five games. Gorzelanny allowed only eight earned runs in his six starts in May. "I'm still a long ways from being established," said Gorzelanny, who is in his second full season in the majors. "And I'm just going to go out there, do my thing, work hard. I know there's still a lot of things I have to work on, especially with my pitch count." That negative aspect of his game was on display in the first inning, when Gorzelanny threw 34 pitches and loaded the bases before escaping unscathed. "He showed tremendous signs of a very mature guy out there," Pirates manager Jim Tracy said. "In the first inning of the game it looks like 'How far are we going to be able to get with him with 34 pitches in the first inning?' He just kept battling. This guy finds ways. "He kept getting better as the night goes on." The only run he allowed was a sacrifice fly by Termel Sledge that scored Kevin Kouzmanoff in the sixth. Other than the first inning, he twice stranded runners at second base. The last batter Gorzelanny faced was Adrian Gonzalez, with a runner on and two outs in the seventh. Gorzelanny struck him out with his 120th pitch. "You've got to give credit to their guy," San Diego manager Bud Black said. "He wobbled a little bit but made a couple of pitches that get them out of the inning. A hit in that inning with a couple of guys on would have been nice but Gorzelanny hung in there and made some pitches. "I can see why this guy has a two-and-a-half ERA, he's got good stuff. He's got a lot of things going for him." Jose Bautista helped the Pirates take an early lead against David Wells. He singled and scored on Xavier Nady's single in the first, and doubled and scored on Freddy Sanchez's single in the third to make it 2-0. Wells (2-3) allowed two runs and eight hits in five innings, walked one and struck out two. The Padres have scored only seven runs in his past four starts. Diamondbacks 11 Phillies 5 At Philadelphia, Orlando Hudson had four hits and drove in four runs while Micah Owings pitched five effective innings to lead Arizona over the Phillies. Dodgers 10 Nationals 0 At Washington, Brad Penny scattered four singles over 6 1-3 innings and Juan Pierre had a career-high four extra-base hits for Los Angeles. Mets 5 Giants 4 (12 innings) At New York, Carlos Delgado hit his second homer of the game for the Mets moments after Jose Reyes provoked excitable San Francisco reliever Armando Benitez to balk home the tying run in the 12th inning. Marlins 9 Cubs 4 At Chicago, Jeremy Hermida hit a tiebreaking three-run homer in the fifth inning and Josh Willingham added a three-run double in the eighth to lead Florida. Reds 2 Astros 1 At Houston, Scott Hatteberg hit a solo home run in the eighth and Matt Belisle struck out a career-high eight for Cincinnati, which handed the Astros their ninth consecutive loss. Brewers 5 Braves 4 At Milwaukee, Ben Sheets brushed off a poor first inning to get the win and Prince Fielder hit his NL-leading 17th homer for the Brewers, who snapped a six-game losing streak by beating Atlanta. Rockies 8 Cardinals 3 At Denver, Yorvit Torrealba hit a grand slam and Rodrigo Lopez struck out a season-high seven in six innings as Colorado won its seventh straight. The New York Yankees are finding new ways to lose as they suffer through a crippling slump. Aaron Hill stole home, sliding in safely ahead of Andy Pettitte's throw in the seventh, and Alex Rios had a go-ahead sacrifice fly to help the Toronto Blue Jays beat New York 3-2 Tuesday night. "It seems like we're losing every way possible and tonight was no different," Johnny Damon said. The Yankees (21-29) have lost five straight and 13 of 18 to fall eight games under .500 for the first time since they were 11-19 on May 6, 2005, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. "You can envision us struggling, just not this long," Derek Jeter said. "Every team scuffles at times but we've been scuffling for a long time now." Boston's 4-2 victory over Cleveland on Tuesday dropped the Yankees a season-high 14½ games behind the Red Sox in the AL East. "It's certainly not getting any easier for us," manager Joe Torre said. "We just have to keep plugging. It's a mountain to climb right now." Elsewhere in the AL it was: Boston 4 Cleveland 2, Detroit 14 Tampa Bay 2, Baltimore 6 Kansas City 2, Minnesota 9 Chicago 2, Texas 4 Oakland 0 and Los Angeles 4 Seattle 1. At Toronto, Adam Lind led off the eighth with a double off Pettitte, went to third on a sacrifice and scored on Rios' fly ball to centre off reliever Scott Proctor. Proctor threw his glove in the dugout after getting the final out of the inning. Pettitte (3-4) allowed three runs and six hits over 7 1-3 innings. He struck out three and walked one. "He's not getting any support from us right now and neither are any of our other pitchers," Damon said. Jeremy Accardo (1-0) pitched 1 2-3 innings for the win. Hill's steal in the seventh gave the Blue Jays a 2-1 lead. Singles by Frank Thomas and Hill put runners at first and second with one out. Jason Phillips then grounded to third baseman Alex Rodriguez, who stepped on the bag to force out Thomas. Rodriguez threw to first to try to retire Phillips, who collided with Josh Phelps as the throw arrived, knocking the ball loose and allowing Hill to advance to third. With the count 1-1 to Royce Clayton, Hill took a walking lead, then broke for the plate. Facing away, Pettitte didn't notice until catcher Jorge Posada stepped out and waved his right arm. Pettitte threw home but Hill slid in safely ahead of the tag. "I saw him running right away," Posada said. "I stood up and was screaming but obviously the fans were screaming too." Pettitte said he hesitated for a split second because he thought the umpire had called a balk. "I didn't feel like I hesitated for that long for a guy to be able to steal home on me," Pettitte said. "He must have been a way off third base. Unless I'm losing my mind, I thought the umpire threw his hands up in the air, too. I'm not real sure. "To be out of the stretch, what can you say? That's embarrassing." Hill said third base coach Brian Butterfield told the Blue Jays before the game that Pettitte was vulnerable to a steal of home. "I definitely felt my heart beating," Hill said. "I've never done it before and I didn't know what was going to happen. I just pictured the umpire calling me safe to hopefully give me a little better boost." It was Toronto's first steal of home since Shea Hillenbrand did it Aug. 6, 2005, against the Yankees. "I didn't think you could lose an American League ballgame like that," Pettitte said. "Every little thing is costing us games and we're not doing a whole lot to get it done." New York went 1-for-7 with runners in scoring position, and is 1-for-13 in its past two games. "We're just not swinging the bats," Jeter said. "We sprinkle hits here and there but we're just not getting the job done." Torre said the losing streak has left his team feeling tense. "Everybody seems to want to do it themselves and you can't do it that way," Torre said. "We need to have a game where we can have a little fun. We haven't been able to do that and it's based on the fact that we seem to keep fighting uphill all the time." Red Sox 4 Indians 2 At Boston, Josh Beckett returned from the disabled list to win his eighth consecutive decision, pitching seven innings of three-hit ball to lead the Red Sox to a victory over Cleveland. Tigers 14 Devil Rays 2 At St. Petersburg, Fla., Gary Sheffield homered twice and drove in five runs, and Jeremy Bonderman won his fourth straight start for Detroit. Orioles 6 Royals 2 At Kansas City, Mo., Jeremy Guthrie pitched seven strong innings and Ramon Hernandez drove in two runs as Baltimore handed the Royals their sixth straight loss. Twins 9 White Sox 2 At Minneapolis, Justin Morneau of New Westminster, B.C., homered and drove in four runs for Minnesota in its third straight win. Rangers 4 Athletics 0 At Oakland, Calif., Sammy Sosa lined a two-run single that got by charging left fielder Shannon Stewart, breaking a scoreless tie in the sixth and helping Texas end a season-worst six-game losing streak. Angels 4 Mariners 1 At Anaheim, Calif., Ervin Santana allowed one run over seven innings and Shea Hillenbrand hit a two-run homer as Los Angeles beat Seattle.

Giants 3, Mets 0 NEW YORK (AP) -Barry Zito had the New York Mets on his short list when he was looking at teams as a free agent in the offseason. He opted for a big deal with the San Francisco Giants, insisting it was nothing personal. He sure looked composed against the Mets on Wednesday night, outpitching Tom Glavine over seven sharp innings to help the Giants snap a four-game losing streak with a 3-0 victory. ''I don't really want to pitch with any kind of vendetta against people,'' Zito said of facing New York. ''You know for me it's just about being aggressive and throwing strikes and hope for the best.'' Pedro Feliz drove in three runs and Rich Aurilia tied a career high with four hits for the Giants, who bounced back from a difficult loss in the series opener against New York. The Mets won 5-4 in 12 innings Tuesday night when Armando Benitez balked in the tying run and surrendered a game-ending homer to Carlos Delgado. ''That's a tough one, losing in extra innings, especially when you have the lead,'' Giants manager Bruce Bochy said, ''and to bounce back, play well, get a win, that's huge for the club.'' Paul Lo Duca had two hits for New York, which had won four straight. It was the first time the Mets had been shut out this season. Glavine went seven innings but was denied in his second attempt at career win No. 296. ''It was just a streak of bad luck early in the game,'' Glavine said. Lo Duca led off the seventh with a double for his 1,000th career hit but Zito retired the next three batters, striking out pinch-hitter Julio Franco to end the inning. Zito (5-5) turned in his second consecutive strong outing after struggling in back-to-back starts earlier this month. He gave up 13 runs and 12 hits in 10 innings in outings at Colorado and Oakland, then allowed one run in seven innings in a win over Houston in his last start. Zito, who beat the Mets for the second time this season, said he tried to be too fine against Oakland. ''You've just got to throw at these guys and be aggressive in the zone, let them get themselves out instead of trying to be too perfect,'' said Zito, who left the Athletics for a $126 million, seven-year deal with San Francisco. ''That's kind of been my approach the last couple days.'' He struck out a season-high seven against the Mets, holding them to six hits and one walk. Jack Taschner tossed a perfect eighth and Brad Hennessey got three outs for his second save. Barry Bonds returned to the lineup for the Giants, went 1-for-3 with a walk and remains 10 shy of breaking Hank Aaron's career record of 755 homers. He was booed lustily each time he came to the plate. Bonds entered with a .329 batting average and four homers in 100 career plate appearances against Glavine, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He hit a two-out single to center against him in the first inning to put runners on first and second. After Bengie Molina walked, Feliz grounded a two-run single into left field. ''You've got to be very patient,'' Bonds said about facing Glavine. ''The bottom line is if you're not patient, he's going to kill you. But if he makes a mistake, I'm going to kill him. If he doesn't make a mistake, he's going to win.'' Bonds bounced into a double play in the third before Molina singled to right to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. Feliz then tripled off the wall in right-center to make it 3-0. Glavine (5-3) intentionally walked Bonds in the fifth and got him to groundout to first to end the seventh on his 122nd and final pitch of the game. He allowed nine hits, walked two and struck out four. ''I thought he pitched pretty well,'' Mets manager Willie Randolph said. ''They found some holes. We felt we could score some runs but once Zito got in a groove it was tough.'' Mets reliever Guillermo Mota was activated after serving the 50th and final game of his suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance. He relieved Glavine to start the eighth and received a mixed reaction of boos and cheers from the home crowd. ''It was nice to be back,'' said Mota, who threw two scoreless innings Notes: Giants SS Omar Vizquel made two slick, barehanded plays in the first four innings. ... The Mets optioned RHP Ambiorix Burgos to Triple-A New Orleans to make room for Mota on the roster. ...

But after watching his team's latest debacle -- a 7-6 loss at Minnesota in which the Sox blew a five-run lead, extended their losing streak to four games and dropped to the .500 mark for the season -- he hinted that changes could be looming. "If we have to shake up this ballclub, we will," Guillen declared after watching reliever David Aardsma walk Torii Hunter on four pitches with two outs and the bases loaded in the ninth inning. "At least Kenny Williams will," he said of the general manager. "I'm sitting here and watching since July of last year to right now, the same &#091;stuff&#093;. If I'm going to get fired, good. If this team's going to get better with me out of here, I'll be happy. But as long as I'm here, we have to play better." Williams will have plenty to assess after concluding a one-week trip to the minor leagues. More moves could be made to shore up the unreliable bullpen. In Wednesday's loss, slumping Mike MacDougal fueled the Twins' winning rally with a walk to Jason Tyner. Guillen pulled no punches after the Sox were swept at the Metrodome and outscored 26-12. He said the Twins made the Sox look "like Little Leaguers" and repeatedly used the word "embarrassing" to describe their play. "It's not early anymore," catcher A.J. Pierzynski said. "It's frustrating because we think we're a better team than this, that we're a better hitting team and a better pitching team. And we proved that we pitch at times and can hit at times." The Sox fell to 24-24 after Jon Garland walked a season-high five batters. Sox pitchers walked eight total, and five of them scored. Also, five of the Twins' seven runs came with two outs. Moreover, the once-dependable rotation has an 0-4 record and an 8.31 ERA in its last six starts. And the Sox lineup went hitless after the third inning. With each loss, the postgame mood has been quieter. "We've been winning a lot of series other than obviously this one, but it hasn't seemed like we've been winning a lot of games," Aardsma said. "We've been going out there and winning, but it doesn't seem like it because we always seem to leave ourselves down. We'll pull ourselves out of it, but we have to do it game-by-game." Before the game, Guillen said Darin Erstad, Jim Thome, Jermaine Dye and Paul Konerko were the only position players with secure spots in the lineup. He expanded the responsibility to the entire roster after the game. "I will take the blame like I always do," Guillen said. "In the meanwhile, the 25 guys we have, they had better look themselves in the mirror." Garland also absorbed his share of blame. "I absolutely &#091;stunk&#093;," he said, adding an off-color adverb for emphasis. "That's the only way to describe it." Guillen described his pregame session as a wake-up call. "If people think there are going to be trades here, they start playing better," Guillen he said. "If you're going to get traded, play better because they're not going to trade names, they're going to trade players to help someone else win." For the record, scouts from the San Francisco Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers watched the Sox during various stages of the three-game series at the Metrodome. But they also could have been looking at the Twins, who certainly outperformed the Sox in all categories. "They play as a team, they compete as a team, they get you as a team," Guillen said, reiterating his admiration for the Twins. "That's why they win, and that's why they have five or six division titles, because they earn it. Nobody gives it to them. "They deserve credit. They showed up and kicked us. If we continue to play like that, it's not only going to be the Twins, it's going to be everybody in the American League taking advantage of us."

http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/05/31/ap3772858.html&cid Bedard Throws Down Aces As Orioles Win - Forbes.com Bedard Throws Down Aces As Orioles Win 05.31.07, 1:27 AM ET Giving up only eight earned runs in his previous 34 innings hadn't produced a win, so Erik Bedard took the next logical step. He didn't give up any runs at all. Outpitching Kansas City's Gil Meche, Bedard allowed four hits in eight innings Wednesday night and led Baltimore to a 3-0 victory, the fifth straight win for the Orioles and the seventh loss in a row for the hapless Royals. "It's always tough when it's 0-0 late in the game," Bedard said. "But you just stay in there and battle and good things will happen." Winless since April 18, Bedard (4-3) had five strikeouts and two walks in his longest outing of the season. Only one runner got past second against the left-hander. Jay Payton broke up the scoreless duel with an RBI single in the eighth and Nick Markakis, inserted into right field for defensive purposes, hit a two-run homer in the ninth off Zack Greinke. Meche (3-4) bounced back from his worst outing of the year to throw one of his best games since joining Kansas City. "Gil was terrific," said Royals' manager Buddy Bell, who was ejected in the top of the eighth for arguing with Marty Foster after the home plate umpire had thrown out Emil Brown for arguing a called third strike. "It's hard to win when you don't score any runs," Bell said. "He gave us what we needed, but we couldn't do anything with Bedard." After matching Bedard with seven shutout innings, Meche departed when Payton grounded an RBI single through the hole into left with one out in the eighth. The right-hander gave up four hits and one run in 7 1-3 innings. He walked four and had five strikeouts after allowing seven runs and 11 hits in 4 1-3 innings his previous start. "Coming out of a slump against Bedard is not an easy thing to do," Meche said. "He just beat us." Chris Ray pitched a perfect ninth for his 12th save in 15 chances. Rain delayed the game at the start 1 hour, 36 minutes, then the pitchers did their best to get the fans home quickly. The game took 2:31. It had been so long since his last win, Bedard said he couldn't remember when it happened. "I know it was a long time ago," he said. But frustration, he added, is "part of the game." "It happened the first two years. It happened last year. It happens every year," he said. "You go through a span where you don't win for four or five games in a row, then you win five in a row. It's part of the game." Ramon Hernandez walked leading off the eighth for the Orioles, whose five-game winning streak is their longest of the season. Corey Patterson was safe at first when he laid down a bunt and beat the throw to the bag. The runners moved up on Brian Roberts' sacrifice bunt, and then Payton's single broke the scoreless tie. Greinke came in for Meche and struck out the next two batters, Miguel Tejada and Aubrey Huff, on six pitches, but surrendered a single to Kevin Millar ahead of Markakis' home run. Meche's lower back had tightened up in his previous start, rendering him ineffective. But facing a Baltimore lineup which had scored 31 runs and hit .315 while winning four in a row, he was dominant for seven innings. Mora singled leading off the second, then the right-hander retired 16 in a row before walking Roberts to lead off the sixth.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/nyregion/31albany.html&cid Albany Close to Agreement to Ease Ticket Resale Limits - New York Times Albany Close to Agreement to Ease Ticket Resale Limits Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 31, 2007 ALBANY, May 30 — Gov. and state lawmakers are close to reaching agreement on dismantling laws that limit the resale of tickets to musicals, plays, concerts and sports events, but concerns raised recently by the Yankees and Mets appear to have held up a final deal. Skip to next paragraph Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times Gov. Eliot Spitzer met publicly with legislative leaders Wednesday for the fourth time, seeking to resolve issues before the session ends June 21. The Democratic-led Assembly passed a bill on Tuesday rolling back scalping restrictions, and the Republican-led Senate is expected to approve the bill later this week. The governor has supported the idea but has stopped short of endorsing the bill, partly to give the Yankees and Mets time to argue their case, people involved in the negotiations said. “Ticket scalping laws historically have not worked,” the governor said at an appearance on Wednesday morning. “I think permitting a free market to work its magic there is the smart approach.” The measure was supported by Broadway theater owners, licensed ticket resellers and some stadium and arena owners, who said they were losing profits to brokers, individuals and Web sites that can resell tickets at far higher prices. Consumer advocates, however, have opposed the bill, saying it would cause prices to skyrocket. The Yankees and Mets have expressed concern that holders of season tickets would resell single tickets without authorization from teams. Assemblyman Joseph D. Morelle, a Rochester Democrat who sponsored the legislation, said the Yankees wanted to be the only ones allowed to resell tickets to their games, a provision aimed at stopping season ticket holders from selling their tickets on Web sites like Mr. Morelle said he rejected the idea of letting the Yankees be the only authorized seller of their tickets because it would have defeated the purpose of the bill. “It would be unfair for us to say that we’re freeing up the secondary market while allowing producers to restrict the primary market,” he said. Officials for the Yankees and Mets did not return calls for comment. On Wednesday, the governor and legislative leaders held their fourth public meeting in four weeks to negotiate a number of issues they want to resolve before the end of the session on June 21. While the tone was more cordial than at previous meetings, the issues remain unresolved, including a proposal to expand DNA collection to all felonies and misdemeanors. One exception appears to be a bill requiring testing of people indicted on rape or sexual assault charges. Assembly Speaker said Wednesday that he would allow the bill to come to the Assembly floor before the end of the session. That greatly improves the chance that it will become law. It is supported by the governor and the Republican-led Senate and has a majority of Assembly members as co-sponsors. Currently, a conviction is required to compel an H.I.V. test. The measure has been sharply contested by some Assembly Democrats who are concerned about the civil liberties ramifications of testing suspects prior to conviction. Others believe that rape victims could get a false sense of security if suspects in their attacks test negative for H.I.V. Assemblywoman Nettie Mayersohn, a Queens Democrat and the chief sponsor of the bill in the Assembly, said victims and their doctors should be the ones to decide. “This is a decision that should be made by the woman and not by the legislators in Albany,” she said in a recent interview. The governor also vetoed three bills on Wednesday, including one that would have required contractors to post the prevailing wage rates. Mr. Spitzer argued that contractors who obey the law would be subject to unnecessary paperwork while those who do not pay the prevailing wage now would probably simply ignore the new requirement. The ticket scalping bill would allow tickets to be resold for whatever amount the market would bear. The bill also includes protections against consumer fraud. Under the existing anti-scalping law, which expires in June, licensed ticket resellers may charge up to 45 percent above the face value of tickets for events at large arenas. That law makes an exception for venues with fewer than 6,000 seats, including most Broadway theaters, limiting resale of their tickets to no more than 20 percent, or $5 over face value, whichever is greater. Until recently, that exception was supported by the League of American Theaters and Producers , a Broadway trade organization, whose members felt that an unfettered market would cause prices to go beyond the reach of all but the wealthy. But last fall, the league quietly reversed its position, arguing to a state consumer protection board that prices would not skyrocket if the ban was lifted and that the rise of sites on the Internet had already made it impossible to enforce. Steve A. Malito, a spokesman for a trade organization of licensed brokers that had lobbied to lift the ban for years, said the theater league’s change of heart had been pivotal. “It would appear that they now agree that this ultimately benefits the consumers,” Mr. Malito said. “We’re thrilled that they’ve switched their positions.” Consumer advocates said they thought the league had other motives. “Clearly, they think they can benefit financially with the repeal of anti-scalping law,” said Russ Haven, the legislative counsel for the New York Public Interest Research Group , which has opposed the repeal. Broadway has toyed in recent years with different ways to prevent losing ticket sales to brokers, such as reserving a portion of tickets to every performance and selling them at the box office as “premium tickets.” (The top ticket price to “Jersey Boys” is $121.50; a premium ticket costs $351.50.) By eliminating the caps on ticket resales, Mr. Haven said, the Broadway lobby had signaled that it could no longer beat ticket brokers and scalpers and was joining them. To crack down on street scalpers, the new law does ban the resale of tickets within 500 feet of any venue with 5,000 or fewer seats and within 1,500 feet of larger venues. However, it would allow theaters to open their own resale offices within that zone. In a statement, Charlotte St. Martin, the league’s executive director, praised the anti-fraud provisions in the bill and “the new buffer zone in the theater district that will prevent illegal ticket scalping in front of Broadway theaters.” Campbell Robertson contributed reporting from New York City.

Editor of The Cincinnati Post Editor of The Kentucky Post Kentucky Post City Editor Who needs a bullpen? Starters on a roll as Reds win 3rd straight By C. Trent Rosecrans Reds starter Aaron Harang allowed only six hits in his complete-game performance Wednesday. His record is now 6-2. 6 pitches, then the old heave-ho Wednesday's game: Reds 4, Astros 3 Diamondbacks win duel of aging lefties A-Rod's bark bites Blue Jays Norris Hopper dives for home plate in front of Houston catcher Brad Ausmus with the eventual winning run in the sixth inning Wednesday night. Actress Ashley Judd kissed her husband, race car driver Dario Franchitti, after he threw out the ceremonial pitch. Following the seventh inning, Reds starter Aaron Harang told bench coach Bucky Dent - filling in for the ejected manager Jerry Narron - that he was going to finish Wednesday night's game with the Astros. It didn't matter that Harang had just given up his first two hits since the second inning and a run in the Astros' seventh inning. Wednesday night's game belonged to him. Harang gave up another run in the eighth, but retired the Astros in order in the ninth to give Cincinnati a 4-3 victory at Minute Maid Park. The Reds won their third game in a row and sent Houston to its 10th consecutive loss. Harang's outing was the third outstanding showing by a Reds pitcher in a row. Kyle Lohse started the run with a shutout against the Pirates on Monday, Matt Belisle went 7 2/3, allowing four hits and a run on Tuesday in Houston and on Wednesday, Harang allowed six hits and three runs (two earned) in his complete-game performance. None of the three walked a single batter in that stretch. "You want to do better than the guy the night before," Harang said. "We got on Belisle because he couldn't finish it off. It's been a fun time, we're throwing the ball well and rolling." Bronson Arroyo is next in line for the Reds against the 1-7 Woody Williams tonight. Williams' lone victory is against Cincinnati. The Astros are experiencing the malaise that had been infesting the Reds' clubhouse before the current mini-streak. Houston is one loss shy of the franchise record of 11 losses in a row set in August of 1995. The Reds, on the other hand, have won three in a row for the first time since the end of April and first day of May. Cincinnati's turned it around (for the time being, at least) with strong starting pitching and impressive defense, including a spectacular diving stop and throw by third baseman Edwin Encarnacion in the eighth inning. In the 12 games since Encarnacion was recalled from Class AAA Louisville, he has yet to make an error. "I try to do anything to help the team win games," said Encarnacion, who reached base twice Wednesday night on errors by Houston second baseman Craig Biggio. "That's one of the keys to win games, play solid defense and get good pitching." Another key has been good starts - in both the tops and bottoms of innings. Cincinnati leadoff man Norris Hopper has reached base in eight of his nine plate appearances since taking over the position for the injured Ryan Freel on Tuesday. Wednesday, Hopper led off the game with a double, which sparked a three-run outburst to give Harang a comfortable lead with which to work. Hopper then scored the eventual game-winning run in the sixth after he earned a two-out walk -his first walk of the season - and scored on shortstop Alex Gonzalez's double to make it 4-1. "I've been leading off all my life, so I'm pretty comfortable with that role," said Hopper. "With Gonzalez, (Ken) Griffey and (Adam) Dunn hitting behind you, if you get on base, you're going to score. So that's what I try to do. When you get on base, that puts a lot of pressure on the defense, and they've got to be on their toes. You never know when you're going to go for that (stolen) bag, or whatever." That's exactly why Harang was successful, catcher David Ross said. Harang allowed only two batters leading off an inning to reach base - Carlos Lee singled in the seventh and Biggio doubled to start the eighth. Both Lee and Biggio scored in those innings. "It's all about starting off innings, when you get the first batter out, it's a big load off your shoulders," Ross said. "That's when you can cruise a little bit. (Harang) seemed to get that first guy out every inning. It seems like in the past, when we're struggling, that leadoff guy gets on. Then the manager has a ton of things he can do, he can hit-and-run, he can bunt a guy over, he can send him. Then all the bloops we had, some of those are because we're holding the guy on first and it goes over the first baseman's head or something like that." That didn't happen against the Astros on Wednesday. After getting Biggio to lead off the game, Morgan Ensberg singled and then scored on Lee's two-out double. Harang retired right fielder Luke Scott to start the second before Adam Everett singled. Everett would be the last Houston base runner until Lee's seventh-inning single as Harang retired 14 Astros in a row. "You throw strikes and get ahead and good things happen," said Harang, who struck out seven batters. "I was throwing a pretty good sinker today and slider had a good, tight downward movement to it. I threw a couple of good changeups." Harang's gone eight or more innings in three of his last four starts and improved his record to 6-2 on the season. "That's why management was smart and locked him up for a bunch of years - they knew," Ross said of the off- season extension signed by Harang. "He's a good pitcher and he's not afraid. That's what I like, he doesn't change his game for a hitter. His game plan is to go after the zone, if you're going to beat him, you've got to go at him. He's a fun guy to catch because he's so aggressive." Pitching performances like that have also made it fun for the Reds - as has winning. Winning wasn't something the team didn't do much of this month, winning just nine games in May headed into the final day of the month. While still owners of the National League's worst record at 21-33, the Reds could move into a tie for fifth in the National League Central with Houston with a victory today and enter today 8½ games behind slumping Milwaukee. The Reds would also own a percentage-points lead over the Astros for avoiding the dubious title of the NL's worst team. "You can just tell the atmosphere in the locker room is way different than it was five days ago," said Hopper, whose average is up to .321. "Coming off a couple of wins, everyone's hustling and playing hard and that's all you can ask for." Search our site by keyword: Your Guide to the City: Letters to the editors The Enquirer.

http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/05/29/ap3768034.html&cid Pirates Win Behind Emerging Ace - Forbes.com Pirates Win Behind Emerging Ace 05.29.07, 11:57 PM ET Tom Gorzelanny overcame a shaky start and kept himself among the National League's ERA leaders. Gorzelanny, who entered the game third in the NL with a 2.51 ERA, lowered that number to 2.39 after overcoming a shaky first inning to work seven solid innings in the Pittsburgh Pirates' 4-1 victory over the San Diego Padres on Tuesday night . Pirates outfielder Jason Bay, who kept his own hot streak going with two hits, including his eighth homer, acknowledged that the left-hander is Pittsburgh's leader on the mound. "I'm not going to say he came out of nowhere," Bay said, "but he's our bona fide guy right now. He's our stopper. It's nice to have that guy that goes out there every single day and you're thinking he's going to throw a gem and give you a chance to win." Josh Bard went 3-for-4 and Jose Cruz had two hits for the Padres, who had won three in a row and six of seven. Gorzelanny (6-3) scattered seven hits while allowing the one run, striking out four and walking three as the Pirates won for the fourth time in five games. Gorzelanny allowed only eight earned runs in his six starts in May. "I'm still a long ways from being established," said Gorzelanny, who is in his second full season in the majors. "And I'm just going to go out there, do my thing, work hard. I know there's still a lot of things I have to work on, especially with my pitch count." That negative aspect of his game was on display in the first inning, when Gorzelanny threw 34 pitches and loaded the bases before escaping unscathed. "He showed tremendous signs of a very mature guy out there," Pirates manager Jim Tracy said. "In the first inning of the game it looks like `How far are we going to be able to get with him with 34 pitches in the first inning?' He just kept battling. This guy finds ways. "He kept getting better as the night goes on." The only run he allowed was a sacrifice fly by Termel Sledge that scored Kevin Kouzmanoff in the sixth. Other than the first inning, he twice stranded runners at second base. The last batter Gorzelanny faced was Adrian Gonzalez, with a runner on and two outs in the seventh. Gorzelanny struck him out with his 120th pitch. "You've got to give credit to their guy," San Diego manager Bud Black said. "He wobbled a little bit but made a couple of pitches that get them out of the inning. A hit in that inning with a couple of guys on would have been nice but Gorzelanny hung in there and made some pitches. "I can see why this guy has a two-and-a-half ERA, he's got good stuff. He's got a lot of things going for him." Jose Bautista helped the Pirates take an early lead against David Wells. He singled and scored on Xavier Nady's single in the first, and doubled and scored on Freddy Sanchez's single in the third to make it 2-0. Bay hit his third homer in his past five games to answer San Diego's run in the sixth - the first homer Padres reliever Cla Meredith had allowed in 21 appearances this season. Bay, who was named NL player of the week earlier Tuesday, is 12-for-24 with three home runs and 11 RBIs in his past seven games. "A lot of times in the past you go on a little hot streak, and it doesn't mean as much because you're not winning," Bay said. "This has coincided with us winning so I think it means a little bit more." Wells (2-3) allowed two runs and eight hits in five innings, walked one and struck out two. The Padres have scored only seven runs in his past four starts. "I would never point the finger at my teammates for a lack of run support because these guys are going out there ... trying to score," Wells said. "And that's all you can do. I threw the pitches so I'm the one to blame." The Pirates added an insurance run in the eighth against Kevin Cameron, the first run he allowed in 17 1-3 career innings. Adam LaRoche - who had three hits - singled in Bay. Salomon Torres pitched the ninth for his 12th save. Notes:@ San Diego 2B Marcus Giles was ejected by first base umpire Joe West before the bottom of the second began. Giles was called out on strikes by plate umpire C.B. Bucknor in the top of the inning on a ball that could have been low. ... Oscar Robles, Giles' replacement, was originally called out on a sinking line drive to left that television replays showed Bay trapped. After Black came out to argue the call, the umpires gathered and reversed it, giving Robles a single. Tracy then argued, to no avail. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Eliot L. Spitzer supports the measure. Click to view a larger picture State to end price cap on brokered tickets - NEWS ALBANY BUREAU Updated: 05/31/07 7:26 AM ALBANY &#8212; A measure ending current price caps on how much scalpers and brokers can charge on tickets to sports and entertainment events is moving toward final approval by state lawmakers and Gov. Eliot L. Spitzer. A day after the measure was overwhelmingly approved by the Assembly, the governor Wednesday added his voice of support to bring a free-market system to the booming business of ticket reselling that has been bolstered in recent years by an assortment of Internet sites. The Senate is expected to approve the legislation today. The measure, depending on which side is believed in the debate, will either end up cutting or sharply raising the price of tickets to sports, theatrical and entertainment events that are resold by individuals, scalpers and ticket reselling outlets, such as StubHub. &#8220;Competition means lower prices,&#8221; said Sen. Dean Skelos, a Nassau County Republican and sponsor of the bill likely to be approved today in the Senate. After an intense lobbying campaign, which featured the likes of everyone from eBay to the Buffalo Bills and New York Yankees and some of Albany&#8217;s most influential lobbying firms, the legislative agreement ends a longtime price cap that now prohibits resellers from charging more than 45 percent above a ticket&#8217;s face value for events in venues with more than 6,000 seats. The Assembly on Tuesday passed the bill, 102-34. Critics say the measure will open the floodgates to price gouging by scalpers and ticket resale companies. But promoters insist a free market system will keep ticket prices from going sky high and could, depending on supply and demand pressures, cut resale prices. The governor said the regulation has been difficult to enforce, especially with a booming ticket resale business on the Internet. Further, he said the law &#8220;doesn&#8217;t make sense&#8221; to apply price controls on the so-called secondary ticket market when there is no cap placed by the state on a ticket&#8217;s first point of sale by arena and theater box offices. The governor did not if he would definitely sign the legislation, but he made clear his support, calling it &#8220;smart judgment&#8221; to let the current limits expire. In a floor debate in the Assembly Tuesday, detractors said the measure will have one effect: higher ticket prices, especially on moderate-income families who already find themselves being priced out of the regular ticket market. It will lift the cap that now applies to an array of ticket resellers, from eBay listings to TicketExchange, the Bills&#8217; ticket resell program. Assemblyman Sam Hoyt, DBuffalo, said officials with the Buffalo Bills earlier had urged him to vote against the measure; he said the Buffalo Sabres had remained neutral on the bill. Citing the difficulties of the Buffalo Bills to flourish in a smaller NFL market city, Hoyt said he did not want to back any effort that could hurt the team. &#8220;I&#8217;m very cautious about supporting any measure that may in face impact the economic strength of a particular industry, especially in this case the Buffalo Bills,&#8221; he told his colleagues Tuesday. Hoyt later acknowledged the Bills may have softened earlier opposition with the introduction of some amendments to the measure. Officials with the Bills and Sabres declined comment Wednesday. Lawmakers from downstate, meanwhile, lamented the effect on families being able to afford Broadway plays and other cultural events. &#8220;I think this bill is a real mistake. I think the wrongs that it will do are not what are in the minds of the [bill&#8217;s] sponsors, but the wrongs that it will do are very much in the minds of those pushing this bill,&#8221; said Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, D-Manhattan. Supporters say New York &#8212; in the face of ticket resales from brokers in states with no price caps and an increasing number of Internet ticket sales outlets &#8212; has been unable to enforce its own price cap law. &#8220;Market restrictions by statute, I believe, are no longer applicable in this day and age,&#8221; said Assemblyman Joseph Morelle, a Rochester Democrat who sponsored the measure in the Assembly. The online company eBay, in a memo backing the bill, said current law prevents New Yorkers from buying tickets beyond the price cap. &#8220;Many New Yorkers are therefore unable to purchase tickets to their favorite sporting events, concerns or other large entertainment venues while non-New Yorkers can purchase the tickets without any restrictions,&#8221; the company&#8217;s lobbying memo said. It said the measure replaces a system with &#8220;an arbitrary price cap&#8221; to ticket sales led by &#8220;traditional market forces.&#8221; Current law includes two caps: the 45 percent above face value for events in venues with more than 6,000 seats and a 25 cap above face value for tickets to events in venues with fewer than 6,000 seats. The legislation also: &#8226; Ends current local government licensure of ticket resale brokers, placing the role under the state Department of State. Those selling fewer than five tickets per event are not considered brokers and don&#8217;t have to register. &#8226; Prohibits restrictions being placed on fans by the operators of venues, such as professional sports teams, involving such things as the sale of season tickets to resale companies. The Yankees last year moved against a number of season ticket holders who tried to resell tickets on StubHub. &#8226; Keeps intact a 1,500-foot buffer zone around large arenas, and sets a new, 500-foot buffer for venues with fewer than 500 seats, inside which ticket scalping is illegal. New York state&#8217;s big sports teams &#8212; including the Bills, Sabres, Rangers, Yankees, Knicks and Mets &#8212; opposed the measure a month ago over concerns involving a season ticket holder provision. The teams were concerned the bill would limit their ability to cut off a season ticket holder who engaged in illegal or fraudulent acts when reselling tickets, such as selling one ticket to two different buyers. Legislative sources said the Yankees also were pressing to ensure that only they could be the resellers of tickets to Yankees games. The final version makes clear that the ticket holder &#8212; not the team &#8212; has the say over how a ticket can be resold. But it also included an amendment giving teams authority to discipline ticket holders who abuse ticket reselling.

http://www.sbsun.com/sports/ci_6025537&cid San Bernardino County Sun - Lowe leads Dodgers to 2nd shutout Lowe leads Dodgers to 2nd shutout Tony Jackson, Staff Writer Article Launched: 05/31/2007 12:14:58 AM PDT WASHINGTON - If this wasn't Derek Lowe at his finest, then pity the Washington Nationals if they ever do run into the vintage version. On a Wednesday night when he couldn't locate his breaking ball, Lowe managed seven shutout innings and 11 ground-ball outs in a 5-0 victory over the Nationals in front of 22,360 at RFK Stadium. With that, the Dodgers assured themselves of winning a series for the first and last time in the three-year lifespan of this ballpark, where they will make their final appearance tonight. In winning the first two games, the Dodgers have outscored the Nationals 15-0, marking the first time they have turned in consecutive shutouts in three years. "The final line score looked good, but it didn't tell the whole story," Lowe said. "I was (behind in counts) 3-1, 2-0, and you're not going to win many games like that. But you just have to trust your stuff and feel like it's going to come around." By the time the Dodgers staked him to a 2-0 lead in the fifth - the second run scoring on an RBI single by Rafael Furcal to run his hitting streak to a career best-tying 15 games - it had come around for Lowe, who retired 13 of his final 15 batters while allowing just one hit, an infield single by Guzman in the fifth that could have been ruled an error on rookie third baseman Tony Abreu.

The offense couldn't get caught up in the intrigue of getting its first look at Japanese import Daisuke Matsuzaka and his six-pitch assortment. And in a crucial juncture of the ballgame in the bottom of the seventh, Aaron Fultz couldn't succumb to the pressure of pitching to David Ortiz with the bases loaded. Had the Indians faltered in either of those two segments, they might not have basked in the glow of an 8-4 victory in which they avoided a three-game sweep at the hands of the Red Sox and finished up a nine-game, three-city road trip with a 5-4 record. "The guys really played their tails off this whole trip," manager Eric Wedge said. "Those were three hard-fought games here. I thought we played good baseball here." But while the baseball might have been good, the Tribe's results the first two nights were far from satisfactory. So when Paul Byrd got the ball in opposition of Dice-K, Byrd knew it was an important start. "I think it means a little extra when you're trying to stop a slide," Byrd said. "And I think it means something extra when you're in first place and you have a team a game or two behind you. It's a little extra pressure." The Indians' lead in the American League Central is now 2 1/2 games over the Tigers -- their opponent this weekend at Jacobs Field -- in large part because of Byrd's efforts in the face of that pressure. Byrd won his fourth start in a row with another aggressive attack of the strike zone. He threw a first-pitch strike to 25 of the 27 batters he faced in six-plus innings, and, as has become the standard, he didn't walk anybody, running his streak without allowing a free pass to 43 innings. "He controlled the ballgame again," Wedge said of Byrd. "He made pitches when he had to and stayed away from the big inning." The Indians put together two big innings in support of Byrd -- one on the offensive end against Matsuzaka and the other when Byrd left behind a bases-loaded jam in the seventh. Dice-K was putting together an effective, if not efficient, outing against the Tribe through four innings of work. But the Indians erased a 2-0 deficit in the fifth to set up a sixth inning in which their bats, which had been downright stagnant the first two games of this series, really came alive. Trot Nixon opened the sixth with a double, and David Dellucci followed that one out later with a double of his own to drive Nixon in and give the Indians their first lead of the series, 3-2. "David had a big hit for us," Wedge said. "He's a guy I'm rooting for, and he's starting to come around." Dellucci came around to score on a Josh Barfield single that would have been a double, had Barfield not overrun second and got caught off the bag by Manny Ramirez's throw from left and Dustin Pedroia's phantom tag. No matter, though. With two outs, the Indians continued to unload with Kelly Shoppach's single and Grady Sizemore's two-run homer to right. Just like that, it was a 6-2 ballgame and Matsuzaka was gone. The Indians had been interested in seeing what a $103.11 million investment could buy, and they seemed to have no trouble adjusting to Dice-K's stuff. "We've all faced great pitchers many times," said Shoppach, who had a four-hit night. "With our offense, there's no giving in. We deserve a little bit of credit of putting our nose in there and getting after some tough pitches against a tough pitcher and chasing him out of there earlier than the last two guys [Curt Schilling and Josh Beckett]." The way Byrd was pitching, he didn't look as though he'd be chased early. He threw just 71 pitches through six innings, and he had what seemed to be a comfortable cushion. But in the bottom of the seventh, the Red Sox got to Byrd in the form of three straight singles with none out. Wedge yanked his starter and put in Tom Mastny, who wasted no time getting Coco Crisp to pop out into foul territory and striking out Kevin Youkilis. The biggest threat, though, was still looming in the form of Ortiz. While game-tying grand slams might not be an everyday occurrence, they seem to be a distinct possibility whenever Big Papi steps to the plate in such situations. This situation was placed in the hands of Fultz, who had struggled with his command throughout this road trip. "The one thing you have to do is slow the game down," Fultz said. "You take a deep breath and go after him." In a nine-pitch at-bat, that's just what Fultz did. And Ortiz nearly took him deep when he hammered a fastball down the right-field line. Fortunately for Fultz, it sliced foul. Fultz's next offering was a 2-2 curveball, and Ortiz lined it weakly to Casey Blake at third with the final out. "It wasn't a very good swing," Fultz said. "Anytime you can get a guy like that out and it's not a very good swing, that's good." The Indians, who pounded out a season-high 18 hits on this night, had to label this a good road trip, given that they're in a stretch of 20 games in 20 days and they swept the division-rival Tigers along the way. "We knew this was going to be a challenging stretch for us," Wedge said. "Our guys were up for it." is a reporter for MLB.com.

(AP) When a bouncing puck found Travis Moen in the slot, he was every bit as dangerous as Teemu Selanne, instead of the checker he's paid to be. Ottawa goalie Ray Emery can't stop a shot by Anaheim's Andy McDonald in first-period action of Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals on Monday. Anaheim won 3-2. Moen wasted no time and snapped a shot past Ray Emery with 2:51 left, giving the Ducks a 3-2 victory over the Senators in the Stanley Cup finals opener Monday night. Moen's fifth goal of the playoffs came after Ryan Getzlaf's tying goal 11:25 earlier erased the 2-1 lead Ottawa carried into the third period. Rob Niedermayer kept the play alive with a sweeping move behind the net, then nudged the puck in his checking linemate's direction. "It was kind of bouncing and I got lucky," Moen said. "I caught it on the way down, got a lucky shot and it went in. It was huge. "I think every kid dreams of scoring a goal to win a game in the Stanley Cup final." The 36-year-old Selanne, playing in the finals for the first time in his 14-year career, was goalless. He led Anaheim this season with 48 goals and 94 points. In the first matchup of the teams this season, Moen, along with Niedermayer and Samuel Pahlsson, held the Senators' top line of Daniel Alfredsson, Jason Spezza and Dany Heatley to two assists and handed Ottawa its first series-opening loss in these playoffs. Mike Fisher staked the Senators to a 1-0 lead in the first period with a power-play goal on Ottawa's first shot, and defenseman Wade Redden also scored on the man advantage in the second. Andy McDonald netted a goal in the first for the Ducks, who will look to take a 2-0 lead at home on Wednesday night. The Senators appeared ready to win their first Stanley Cup finals game since the franchise was reborn in 1992, but Anaheim fought back and stole it away. Ottawa lost only one game in each of its other three playoff series and now faces its first deficit. "I thought we came out pretty good the first 10 minutes," Heatley said. "After a layoff, you can't duplicate game situations. I don't think we're using it as an excuse, I just don't think we played up to our capabilities." Ottawa went without a shot from the 5:36 mark of the first until the end of the period and finished with three. "It's not so much what they did, it's what we didn't do as a line," Spezza said. "We didn't have as much jump." Jean-Sebastien Giguere made 18 saves overall to improve to 10-3 in the playoffs. Getzlaf's goal put the Ducks in a great position: Anaheim is 13-0 in the playoffs when scoring at least twice. Then Moen put them right where they want to be &#8212; ahead in the finals. As thrilled as the sellout crowd was in the arena, it was nowhere near the excitement back in Saskatchewan, where his family and friends camped out in front of the TV to see him play.

And they're doing it against one of their biggest rivals. Justin Morneau homered and drove in four runs and the Twins beat the Chicago White Sox 9-2 Tuesday night for their third straight win. Morneau went 3-for-4 and Jason Kubel added a two-run homer to complement another strong start from Boof Bonser. Michael Cuddyer and Luis Castillo each had three hits. "We're starting to turn it around," Torii Hunter said. "All cylinders are clicking. Man, that'd be big if we can sweep tomorrow. You're talking about the Chicago White Sox." Chicago's struggling pitching staff has allowed 47 hits over the last three games. White Sox pitchers allowed a season-worst 16 hits for the second consecutive game, and walked seven. "Pitching will dictate the game and the last two games the starters and relievers have done a real poor job," Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen said. "Since we've been here, we've played real poorly. They've done the opposite. They've outplayed us right now." Minnesota (26-25) has won six of seven to move over .500 for the first time since May 9. It has won four straight series. Morneau's towering home run in the third clanked off the scoreboard in right field and gave Minnesota a 3-1 lead. Kubel hit a two-run drive to right-center later in the inning. Morneau barely missed another homer in the fourth when his long fly ball hit high off the wall in right. He added a two-run double in the fifth, prompting the Metrodome crowd to begin a chant of "MVP! MVP!" "It's almost like he's expected to hit a home run every time now," Cuddyer said of the reigning AL MVP. Perhaps just as promising as the Twins' rediscovered offense is the emergence of Bonser as a legitimate No. 2 starter behind ace Johan Santana. Bonser (4-1) didn't win his first game until his eighth start this season, but has since rattled off four in a row. The 6-foot-4, 260-pounder entered the game third in the AL in strikeouts per nine innings and fanned six in 6 2-3 innings against Chicago, lowering his ERA to 3.61. He left to a standing ovation in the sixth after loading the bases and walking in a run. "The record part of it is overrated," said Twins catcher Mike Redmond, who left in the eighth inning after being hit by a pitch in the left elbow. He should be OK. "To me, he's been pretty consistent all year. It's nice to score some runs for him. He deserves it." John Danks (3-5) lasted just 3 1-3 innings for the White Sox, allowing six runs and nine hits. Danks was 3-0 with a 1.89 ERA in his three previous starts. He earned his first major league win over the Twins on May 9, giving up one run and three hits in 6 2-3 innings. "I don't know what happened. That's the only way to describe it," Danks said. "I just stunk. Whenever I would get ahead in the count, I wasn't able to throw the pitch I wanted to." Castillo has hit safely in 18 of his last 20 games and tallied his 1,500th career hit with a single in the sixth inning. Twins manager Ron Gardenhire announced after the game that the team will call up prospect Kevin Slowey to start Friday's game against Oakland. Slowey is 6-2 with a 1.54 ERA for Triple-A Rochester. An official roster move will be made after Wednesday's game. Slowey replaces Ramon Ortiz, who was demoted to the bullpen after his last start and pitched a perfect ninth inning in his first relief appearance Tuesday. Notes:@ Chicago's Darin Erstad extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a single to lead off the game. ... Tuesday marked the one-year anniversary of Castillo's last error. Castillo's major league record of errorless games at second base now stands at 138. ... The Twins were retired in order for the first time the entire series in the seventh inning. ... Chicago slugger Jermaine Dye had his 14-game hitting streak snapped. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. &#8212; The buzz among the dozens of NBA executives and coaches sitting in the stands at the Milk House gym on the Disney Wide World of Sports complex had nothing to do with the 62 prospects gathered at the league's predraft camp. It had everything to do with the trade demands from Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant &#8212; trade demands that appeared to be short-lived but rose from the dead later in the day. When Charlotte part-owner Michael Jordan entered the building for the predraft camp's afternoon session, he spotted Memphis general manager Jerry West sitting in the stands. "How you doing, kiddo?" Jordan yelled from the balcony. "So, you're in the middle of all of this turmoil?" West shrugged his shoulders and replied: "Help." Lakers GM Mitch Kupchak, who sat a few feet away, is the third member of a sordid Los Angeles triangle that was created by Bryant. In the morning, the Lakers star told ESPN radio "I would like to be traded, yeah. Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative." A few hours later, he backtracked from those statements in subsequent radio interviews and implied that he wants West, whose contract with the Grizzlies expires June 30, to return to Los Angeles where he played and built Lakers teams that won three championships in the 1990s. Still later, Bryant spoke to the Los Angeles Times and reversed positions again, repeating his desire for a trade. A daily rundown on the three players with Northwest connections at the predraft camp Oregon G Aaron Brooks: The former Franklin High star went a long ways to proving he's more than a scorer, recording five assists and six rebounds in leading his team to a 78-67 victory. "There's no way he's a first-round guy. I don't see that. Second round? Maybe. If you're looking for an energy guy to come off your bench, then he makes sense. But he's 6-foot and he's a 2-guard." Nevada G Marcelus Kemp: The Garfield High grad did little to improve his chances, failing to convince scouts he's more than a scorer. Scored 11 points on 5-for-10 shooting, including a long three-pointer. "Another year [in school] wouldn't hurt. He can still go back because he didn't sign with an agent." Boise State G Coby Karl: For long stretches, he was the best player on the court despite a strong performance from Pittsburgh center Aaron Gray. Though likely an off guard in the NBA, Karl played point guard because no one else on his team could handle the position. He led his squad to a blowout victory and finished with 11 points. "He showed some of the little things that make him a potential NBA player. He ran the team well. He liked passing the ball. He has an understanding of things and a good basketball IQ, but he has to show other scouts other things." "Nothing's changed," Bryant told the paper. "It's just a matter of I don't want to go no place else. I don't have much of a choice. When things like this go down, you just sit back. What can I do? It's like a broken record." The Los Angeles Times reporter then asked Bryant if he still wanted to be traded, to which Bryant quickly and firmly replied: "yes." After hearing his early morning trade demand, many executives at the camp contemplated trading for Bryant. "I guess there's no harm in dreaming," Boston general manager Danny Ainge said before laughing. "I don't think you'd be doing your job, if you didn't give it some thought. We'll see what happens there and that's about all I can say." Like a dozen other NBA teams, the Sonics were briefly in the middle of Bryant trade rumors, primarily because they own the second pick in next month's NBA draft. One report had Seattle signing free agent Rashard Lewis, then trading him or Ray Allen to the Lakers along with the No. 2 pick for Bryant. On Tuesday, president Lenny Wilkens said he'd listen to offers for the second pick, but admitted that he'd only part with the pick in a "blockbuster deal." Greg Oden or Kevin Durant? New York coach Isiah Thomas said the choice isn't as clear-cut as many might believe and considers himself a big fan of the Texas freshman forward. "He's unlike anybody that I've ever seen," Thomas said. "I've never seen a guy quite like him. I've never seen a 6-11 guy do this. I've seen [Kevin] Garnett. I've seen [Dirk] Nowitzki and I've seen all the 6-10, 6-11 supposedly mobile kind of guys. But he [Durant] takes it to another level." Thomas lavished praise on Durant, but NBA rules prohibited him from responding to reports of New York's interest in Lewis. When asked if the Knicks will have an active offseason acquiring free agents and making trades, he said: "I'm listening. If there's a way we can upgrade our team, we definitely will. We're not in a hurry to do anything. The waters are still in Knicks camp. Slow and steady wins the race. We're not looking to make any mistakes. We'll be cautious and very conservative." &#8226; If the Sonics do not renew assistant ' contract today as expected, then he may land in Charlotte on Lewis, who played three seasons in the NBA, spent 1-&#189; seasons in Charlotte. Sonics assistant has drawn interest from Milwaukee. Contrary to an earlier report, New York assistant said the Sonics have not contacted him. &#8226; Despite an invitation, Arizona G , who prepped at Roosevelt High, is a curious no-show at the camp. Calls to Williams' agent said he is unaware why Williams did not attend. Oregon guard , who worked out with Williams in Las Vegas this month, said he thought Williams would arrive on Saturday for physicals and testing. &#8226; Three weeks ago, Durant signed with the Upper Deck trading-card company. Terms were not released, but an industry source said Durant received a $5.5 million deal. , Durant and other top prospects will take part in a media interview session today.

Trying to join teammate Josh Beckett as an eight-game winner, Matsuzaka (7-3) instead suffered his first loss since April 17 as the Indians battered him for six runs (all earned) and 12 hits in 5 2/3 innings to avoid a series sweep and snap the Red Sox' five-game winning streak with an 8-4 victory last night at Fenway Park. The hits tied Curt Schilling for the most allowed by a Sox starter this season, and the loss snapped Matsuzaka's six-game winning streak, the longest by a Red Sox rookie since Aaron Sele reeled off six straight in 1993. Matsuzaka, who saw his ERA climb to 4.83, dismissed the notion that his nausea in the Lone Star State contributed to his outing last night. "I don't think it had any specific effect," said Matsuzaka through translator Masa Hoshino. "I was able to prepare for this start as I usually do." Matsuzaka danced in and out of trouble before the Indians tagged him for four runs in the sixth to turn a 2-2 deadlock into a 6-2 lead and force him out of the game. Cleveland sent eight men to the plate in the inning, and the big blow was a two-run homer into the visitors' bullpen by center fielder Grady Sizemore, who entered last night 0 for 7 in the series. "Against a lineup like that, if you don't consistently make pitches, they have that chance to hurt you," said manager Terry Francona. "Even some of the fastballs he got outs on tonight he misfired on the other side of the plate and [still] got outs. But he wasn't locating it like he can, like he has, like he will." Matsuzaka, who struck out four and walked none, continued a disturbing trend by being bitten by a big inning. He has seen 18 of his 39 earned runs come in just four innings this season and has allowed four or more runs in an inning four times. Last Friday, it was five runs in the fourth against the Rangers. However, catcher Jason Varitek said that all of Matsuzaka's problems can't be blamed on a seeming inability to stop the bleeding at times. "It's been different things," said Varitek. "He's gotten burned on different pitches. I don't think it's that as much as just getting over the hump and getting through innings. We've gotten through innings like that, too, very much so. The two-run homer was more big than the other two runs." Matsuzaka had only one 1-2-3 inning, the third. He loaded the bases in the first before getting Trot Nixon to ground into a double play and stranded Josh Barfield, who singled and stole second, in the second. Cleveland broke through in the fifth against the $103.1 million man to erase a 2-0 Boston lead. Former Sox prospect Kelly Shoppach, who had a career-high four hits, started things with a single. He came around on a Casey Blake ground out. Cleveland got another run when Travis Hafner plated Sizemore, who had doubled to left, with another double to left. Things got dicier for Daisuke in the sixth when five of the six batters he faced belted hits. Cleveland finished with a season-high 18 hits. Matsuzaka acknowledged that he is still trying to find the consistency he had with the Seibu Lions in Japan. "I'm trying to improve my game overall, and it is a challenge," he said. "I'm always keeping in mind that I want to avoid being a burden to my teammates. I hope I can achieve that level of consistency sooner rather than later." So do the Red Sox. But for now, it's important to remember that no matter his price tag or Green Monster-sized hype, Matsuzaka is not like Pedro Mart&#xED;nez, who came to Boston with a Cy Young Award already on his r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;. He is a rookie pitcher feeling his way in the big leagues. His teammates haven't lost sight of that, even if others have. "It's tough to look at him as a rookie because of who he is and everything, even though he is," said Varitek. "He's gone through adjustments -- new teams, new faces, new lineups, new everything. It's all new, and sometimes you forget that because of all the hype he came in with." Christopher L. Gasper can be reached at &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Guerrero's 3-run homer lifts Angels 8-6 Article Launched: 05/30/2007 11:29:29 PM PDT ANAHEIM, Calif.- It isn't often the Los Angeles Angels get home runs from their 3-4-5 hitters in the same game. They came at the right time, because Jered Weaver didn't have his best stuff. Vladimir Guerrero hit a go-ahead, three-run shot off Felix Hernandez, Gary Matthews Jr. and Casey Kotchman hit consecutive home runs in the first, and the Angels bullpen preserved an 8-6 win over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night. "It's good, because there are going to be sometimes when we're not going to do well offensively and our pitchers pick us up and keep us in close ballgames," Guerrero said through a translator. "We have a good pitching staff, and hopefully all of us can contribute to them." Guerrero's homer was his first since May 17 at Seattle. It hasn't been easy getting good pitches to hit, because everyone is pitching around the 2004 AL MVP. Guerrero's greatest strength is he is one of the game's best bad-ball hitters. "I can't get frustrated because it's part of the game. I've been saying that for a long time," Guerrero said. "I don't get frustrated because I trust the people that hit behind me. The home runs just happen when they happen. I don't worry about when they come or when they don't come. But I'm very happy that this one came tonight." Dustin Moseley (4-0) got the win in relief of Weaver, who was pulled after 4 2-3 innings with the Angels down 5-4. After Guerrero's homer put Los Angeles ahead 7-5, Moseley pitched two innings and gave up an RBI double to Raul Ibanez that cut the Angels' edge to 7-6 in the sixth. But Scot Shields pitched a perfect eighth and Francisco Rodriguez worked the ninth for his 18th save in 19 chances. Hernandez (3-3) allowed seven runs and nine hits in seven innings. He surrendered his first three homers of the season, as the Angels took the rubber game of the series and extended their lead in the AL West to 5 1/2 games over the second-place Mariners. "We were a little disappointed because we felt we had a chance to win the game with our ace on the mound," Adrian Beltre said. "It didn't happen, but we're going to get a chance to face these guys again, and hopefully we can do better next time. We've got four months left, so one series is not going to make a difference right now." Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak to 23 games&mdash;tying his career best in 2001. The two-time AL batting champion is within one game of the franchise record set by Joey Cora in 1997. Weaver had won his previous three starts, and the Angels gave him a 4-1 lead in the first inning. But the Mariners made it 4-all on Beltre's RBI double in the fifth and Yuniesky Betancourt followed with an RBI single that finished the right-hander. "My command just really wasn't there," Weaver said. "The off-speed stuff felt great, but I was struggling with my fastball command. I just couldn't make my pitches and they put some good swings on the ball." Pinch-hitter Robb Quinlan drove in an insurance run in the Angels seventh with a sacrifice fly that Betancourt caught. The shortstop made an over-the-shoulder catch in short left-center field and couldn't get the ball home fast enough after Reggie Willits tagged up. Guerrero had a chance to break open the game in the eighth, but struck out with the bases loaded against Brandon Morrow. The rookie reliever extended his scoreless streak to 15 2-3 consecutive innings. The Mariners wrapped up a 6-4 road trip that began with a makeup game in Cleveland and continued through Tampa Bay, Kansas City and Anaheim. When they return to Seattle, the journey will have covered 6,273 miles. "It's going to be good to get back home," Beltre said. "We finished the road trip over .500 and we could have done better, but it was a good trip." Notes:@ Angels infielder Erick Aybar started at third base for the first time in his professional career. Normally a second baseman, he made a neat play on the first batter of the game, making a diving stop on Suzuki's grounder in the hole and throwing him out from one knee. ... Angels RHP Bartolo Colon's next scheduled start on Sunday was pushed back to June 8, when the club opens a nine-game road trip at St. Louis. The 2005 AL Cy Young winner, experiencing tightness in his triceps since early this month, has allowed 15 runs in 10 2-3 innings over his last two starts.

Peavy, who has skyrocketed to the top of nearly everyone's Cy Young watch list, might well be the toast of the National League these days, but Young certainly isn't far behind, in case anyone has noticed this much. You can bet the Pirates did Wednesday night, though they certainly weren't the first to get a taste of Young's dominant stuff -- especially during his blissful run in May that ended as well as it started. Young limited the Pirates to four hits over seven scoreless innings as the Padres defeated Pittsburgh, 9-0, before a crowd of 12,734 which probably wouldn't have been happy to hear that the 6-foot-10 right-hander was once property of the Pirates. "I thought Chris threw the ball very well again," Padres manager Bud Black said. "I think he's on a nice roll. His mechanics, his confidence, his stuff is all coming together. I think we are seeing the results of that in his performance. He's throwing the ball great." It was difficult to tell if Black was talking about the victory by the Padres (30-22) on this night in particular, or Young's fantastic run in May that saw him go 4-1 with a no-decision and a scant 1.13 ERA. His overall ERA has dropped from 4.33 on April 26 to 2.42. "This is the third time since the beginning of last season that we have seen him and we've not been able to do much at all with him," Pittsburgh manager Jim Tracy said. "There is deception with him obviously, and there is something with him that we're not seeing. "I think the size of the man, his deception, his slider seems to be very difficult for our right-handed hitters. We've had very little success with this guy." Indeed, Tracy is right. Young is 3-0 with a 0.76 ERA in his last three starts against the Pirates, including the start last season that saw him finish two outs shy of a no-hitter against the team that drafted him in 2000 only to ship him off to Montreal two years later for, gulp, Matt Herges. Not that any of this interests Young, his dominance over the Pirates or the fact he fared as well as he did in May. April, May ... September, it doesn't really matter much to Young when he pitches well as it does how often he pitches well. After a hiccup in April -- Young was 2-2 with a 4.33 ERA after his first five starts -- he's shifted into Chris Young circa 2006 mode, when he didn't lose a road start all season and ranked among the league leaders in several pitching categories. Young looked every bit like that 2006 model, making quick work of the Pirates (23-29), facing 16 batters over the first five innings. He didn't allow a runner to reach base until the sixth inning when, with one out and runners at second and third, he got Chris Duffy to pop out to shortstop Khalil Greene in foul territory and then got the defending National League batting champion, Freddy Sanchez, to ground out to end the inning. No sweat, or, at least, it didn't look like much of one. "I felt good for the most part and I was able to execute my pitches pretty well," he said. "I had command of my fastball ... that's my bread and butter." That and his slider, a pitch that has shown plenty of bite to it in May. It's a pitch that he used to finish off hitters in his last start on May 24 against the Cubs when he struck out 10 batters. Young had seven strikeouts on Wednesday, many coming on the slider when hitters were geared toward sitting on his fastball. "When you're having guys swing and miss or swing at as many fastballs as he does, it makes all his other stuff that much more effective," Pirates left fielder Jason Bay said. "He has a very deceptive fastball ... and it worked well for him." So did Young's bat, which provided a big-at-the-moment RBI single up the middle, after a botched suicide squeeze attempt in the fifth inning, that gave the Padres a 2-0 advantage. That was the score entering the eighth inning when the Padres scored five runs -- four on Greene's grand slam over the wall in center field. Greene's hit with the bases loaded snapped a 5-for-42 San Diego slump with the bases loaded in 2007. And while that hit alone merely raised the club's average this season with the bases full from .125 to .139, it certainly felt much bigger. "Sometimes, I think we try to get it all at once," said Padres center fielder Mike Cameron, who had three hits and knocked in three runs. "Tonight was collectively pretty good." Especially for Greene, who came into the game hitting .214. While Young has flourished in May, Greene has been mired in what seems like a month-long funk. He was hitting just .153 in May before Wednesday. And while one swing certainly gave the Padres something they haven't had much of this season -- an abundance of runs -- Greene was pragmatic about the offense. "I don't think we're an overly dynamic team as far as scoring runs," he said. "I think we are going to score runs throughout the season, but I don't think it will be five, six or seven runs a game." They might not have to, not with Peavy (7-1) -- who conducted an interview with Sports Illustrated and taped a segment for ESPN's "Rome is Burning" on Wednesday -- and Young, who might just be the best 1-2 punch in the National League, let alone baseball. is a reporter for MLB.com.

Owner Craig Leipold bought the Predators for $80 million and could sell the team for $220 million. That's a $140 million profit. A silo full of milk and cheese. Leipold said he lost $70 million during his tenure, so that's a $70 million profit for buying a hockey team in Tennessee and living in Wisconsin. SHOT OF THE WEEK Every week, we present an NHL photo and I provide a caption. E-mail me your suggestions (include your name and hometown/state) and the next week we will use the best ones and provide a new photo. "Dude, where's my Zamboni?" (Getty Image) "Ar, there be whales here." -- J.D. Frankland (El Segundo, Calif.) "Vodka!?! I am gonna get Alfie for this!" "Darn this New Jersey tap water!" -- Nick Krieger (Washington Twp., N.J.) Ray's latest ploy to keep the crease clear -- Dentyne Ice. -- Chris Neufeld (Kadena Air Base -- Okinawa, Japan) "God bless you. I hope an anvil falls on your head tomorrow." (AP Photo) being laughed out of a bar in 1972 if you said, "Someday, a guy who lives in Wisconsin will get an expansion team in Nashville, sell it a few years later and make $70 million." I bet you would have gotten a can of Blatz or Schlitz shoved up your left nostril out of sheer stupidity. So, as Leipold prepares to leave with his $70 million bag of money, Predators season-ticket holders are out tens of thousands of dollars in tickets, parking, bad beer and hideous uniforms. It's the same old story. And look who is back in town. Our boy, Jim Balsillie! After agreeing in principal to buy the Predators from Leipold this past week, it is seems likely that he will work hard to get his team and move it to Kansas City, Las Vegas, Winnipeg or Ontario. He can help his boy Phil Anschutz get his team in Kansas City, get a state-of-the-art arena built for him in Vegas with the potential for revenue stream or bring a team to Canada and receive hero worship. One of those things will likely happen, whether it's after next season or in the future. Bet on the Preds leaving after the 2007-08 campaign. That was the plan in Pittsburgh, and now that's the plan in Nashville. attendance in Nashville does not average at least 14,000 next season, and the city can buy all of those tickets, the Preds can pay an exit fee of $18 million to get out of their arena lease and leave Music City USA. Balsillie has $18 million in his glove compartment. Also, the Preds had fewer than 9,000 season-ticket subscribers despite the success of the team, which amassed 110 points this season (tied with Anaheim for third best in the NHL). Next season, the Predators will not be the third-best team in the NHL. I would suspect nearly all of their key unrestricted free agents will walk. will sell their homes now and look to move elsewhere. Forsberg will just check out of the local Hampton Inn. There is too much uncertainty with the team. Will they be in Nashville one more season? Two? Three? Will they find a way to leave in July?! Who knows? We do know that losing those four players will change the Predators' place in the standings. The Predators can then bring up the financial losses and shed more payroll by trading existing contracts for draft picks. ( The Preds do not have a first-round pick this June.) The message will then be clear that the Predators want to move. Neither the fans nor the city will continue to shell out hard-earned money in an attempt to play a game of financial chicken with a billionaire. "Let's all buy Predators tickets, watch them lose to Columbus 5-1 and keep the Preds in Nashville!" Bucci believes that time is running out for Predators fans in Nashville. It will be a lost year. Listen, I don't care what Balsillie does with the team. Nashville has shown it probably isn't an NHL city. Fewer than 9,000 season tickets for a 110-point team might be good for arena football or indoor lacrosse or the WNBA, but the NHL isn't like any of those leagues. There are other markets that will produce much larger season-ticket numbers. I've been writing for years that I'm all for another team moving to Canada. That's where the NFL-like passion is, and certainly Ontario can support another NHL team. Kansas City is the favorite because it has a rent-free arena ready to go and Balsillie can hook up his boys in the Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG). If the arena in Winnipeg is NHL caliber in terms of amenities and revenue, it has a shot. Otherwise, Balsillie has to get going and get an arena deal soon for it to be built in time for the 2008-09 season. Perhaps, he already has the framework in place. One way or another, things will likely take shape soon. Whatever the case, turn out the lights Nashville, the party's over. Well, after eight months, here we are. The final series. A best-of-seven for the Stanley Cup. Both teams won 48 games during the regular season and both have won 12 playoff games. One team, one coach, one city will be changed (for the near NHL future, anyway). One team will be able to say, for the rest of their lives, I am a Stanley Cup champion. That is huge. Unbelievably huge. The ASH line of has separated themselves from every other line in hockey. If Ottawa wins this finals series in five games, then it will be an ASH Wednesday. It's hard, however, to believe Anaheim could possibly lose four of five games to anyone. I'm picking Ottawa in this series because of the big line, and the fact that Anaheim continues to lean on 22-year-old , which is always dangerous. That's a lot of responsibility for a young player. Gary A. Vasquez/US Presswire Jean-Sebastien Giguere will have to continue to be a rock in net if the Ducks are to have any chance in the Cup finals. Anaheim has the better goalie and two Hall of Fame defensemen. They have a Hall of Famer in , who should find some holes in if he can get quality chances. And that's the question. Ottawa has lots of speed, lots of jam and plays terrific defense. Anaheim does not have a prolific offense. That sets up well for the Senators. But Ottawa has yet to face a scary, physical team this postseason. Pittsburgh, New Jersey and Buffalo are not scary teams. Anaheim is scary. Spezza, Heatley and Alfredsson won't have it easy against the Ducks. They will get physically pounded in this series. will enjoy playing the Ducks because he becomes an important figure in terms of responding to their physical play. I also get a sense is going to do something big in this series. It seems tailor-made for him, too. These are two great teams. I'd love to see a seven-game series and the thick drama it would provide as players on both teams look for their first Stanley Cup. Anaheim can win this series if is out of his mind, but I think Ottawa will win because: &#8226; The Senators are a very good defensive team that can score. &#8226; Their defense is very rugged. More rugged than Minnesota, Vancouver and Detroit. &#8226; Ottawa has had easy travel. You could hitchhike to Pittsburgh, New Jersey and Buffalo. &#8226; Alfredsson, Heatley and Spezza are top-shelf players, possibly Hall of Famers. They have good size, good reach and are flying right now. They will score power-play goals. In the end, it's a coin flip. These are two great teams. The games will probably be low scoring and close. I think if Ottawa splits in Anaheim, it will come back home and win two there and control the series. Anaheim will be looking to punch Ottawa in the face, kill some early-series power plays and wear down a Senators team that hasn't had a street fight. How the games are called is a huge factor. If the game is called close, it favors Ottawa. If the refs let them play, it favors Anaheim. I'll say they call it close and Ottawa wins in six. The San Jose Sharks' recipe for offseason success? Re-sign to New York for Marc Staal and then trade back to Chicago for a bag of pucks. Now, use that cap space created to sign Drury or Briere. Finally, hand Ron Wilson his pink slip and hire Pat Burns. Problem solved. I see no reason to make a coaching change in San Jose. They need more personality on the back end and I would be very careful about trading a talent like Patrick Marleau. What will happen with Bertuzzi and the Red Wings? Do the Wings take a chance and sign him even with his bad back? Wings fans have been complaining that he didn't contribute enough. A lot of hockey fans, including Wings fans, are still very much against him for the incident. I have mixed feelings myself. I can't throw in my support for him until he proves his back has healed, and I think sometimes his poor play is the result of guilt over that cheap shot. Your thoughts? Osan AB, South Korea I would only sign for a very low salary and at one-year intervals. His health and demeanor are not worth any long-term investment. I'm a long-time reader, but this is my first time to write in. I've been moving around Texas the past few months, switching between going to school, doing an internship and visiting my parents at home. It's been getting more and more frustrating trying to watch the playoffs. First, a few of the Stars-Canucks games were only aired on Fox Sports Net, and got preempted by early-season Astros games down in Houston. Then, later playoff rounds were played on Versus. I find out that my cable provider has changed Versus to a secondary channel, and is thus not provided with the basic 100-channel package. When can we hope to see the NHL where it belongs, on ESPN again, if ever? I don't know how sports TV contracts work; could the NHL and ESPN at least agree on a deal to show the playoffs? The NHL doesn't deserve to be treated on the same level as the Professional Bull Riders Association. Fort Worth/College Station/Houston, Texas Versus is the exclusive cable provider for the NHL. ESPN has always been interested in the NHL, but at a price that makes sense to those making the decisions. The NHL can come back to ESPN any time they want. I don't know what heaven is going to be like, but I'll bet I'll feel something like I do right now. I'm so happy my Ducks are in the dance. I think we've got a great shot at winning. I look at Ottawa and don't see the offense outside of their big three, and they'll have to look at Pronger and Niedermayer and Beauchemin and O'Donnell every shift. I think they can be corralled, and with Giggy playing like he is, where is their scoring? On the other hand, Emery has been good, but he's no Backstrom, Luongo or Hasek. I think the Ducks win in five, right here in Disneyland. Good analysis, Rik. Both teams are playing the best opponent they have seen thus far. If someone doesn't step up, either team could win a quick series because both teams are so good. Sometimes in a matchup like this, where two good teams meet, one gets the upper hand early and just rolls. I have read in numerous places that the Penguins will be players in the free-agent market this offseason (including your May 22 mailbag). However, after many years of payroll slashing, I find it hard to believe the team would go after guys like Forsberg, Kariya or Timonen. Even the local Pittsburgh papers have them focusing on their own guys (Recchi, Roberts) and even trying to pry Alexei Morozov back from Europe. All of these deals would be short term and relatively cheap. While I agree that these guys would make the team much better going into next year -- what is it that has the non-Pittsburgh media excited about the Pens in free agency? Crosby and the lads were good all year, and I think Ray Shero is not going to tinker with the lineup as much as some suspect. What are your thoughts? The Penguins need more scoring and better defensive acumen up front and in front of . But the Penguins will get better every year because they are so young, and young teams normally get smarter, stronger and better. Add the right players as the young players simply improve, and the Penguins can make huge steps quickly. The Penguins need a winger for . They also need some defensemen who have the ability to choke a raccoon to death with their bare hands. If you are the Flyers, do you keep the second pick or trade it? If you keep it, who do you take? If you trade it, to whom and for what? Listen to your scouts and pick the best player. You can't beat the value of a young, fast, talented player who you only have to pay $850,000-900,000 a year. Unless a team blows you away, and that happens sometimes, keep collecting assets. After three rounds of having you pick against my Sens, I am disquieted to see that you took the Sens in the finals. If we go down, it's on you. As a Wings fan, it was heartbreaking to see the team get close to getting its prestige back this season with a deep playoff run that ended too soon. However, the team still has a lot of good, young talent and prospects in all positions, but the goalie position is one that is interesting. Hasek is 40-whatever, Osgood has shown to be a good backup these days and still is waiting for his chance. What do you think the Wings will do next season to secure the net? I think they might take a run at John Buccigross' e-mail address -- for questions, comments or crosschecks -- is john.buccigross@espn.com.

Our gurus have sweated it out and Lord Stanley is going back to Canada. Scott Gomez knows all about the Cup finals and believes that while this will be a close one, Anaheim's defense and goaltending will overpower Ottawa in the end.
http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/n/a/2007/05/29/sports/s222211D70.DTL&cid Piniella Fumes After 'Worst' Cubs Loss Piniella Fumes After 'Worst' Cubs Loss Tuesday, May 29, 2007 (05-29) 22:22 PDT Chicago (AP) -- Lou Piniella didn't need too many words to sum up what he saw Tuesday night. Jeremy Hermida hit a tiebreaking three-run homer in the fifth inning and Josh Willingham added a three-run double in the eighth to lead the Florida Marlins to a 9-4 victory over the slumping Chicago Cubs. Derrek Lee hit a solo homer and pinch-hitter Ryan Theriot added a two-run drive in the seventh for the Cubs, who have lost seven of their last nine. "That might be our worst game of the year," said Piniella, who will address the team on Wednesday about its recent poor play. After Piniella addressed the bad baserunning by the Cubs in his pregame meeting with the media, Mark DeRosa got thrown out at third, trying to advance from second on a grounder to shortstop in the second inning and Michael Barrett got picked off at second in the same inning. "Not a good play," Piniella said on DeRosa's choice to go to third. "Getting picked off second base not a good play." Dontrelle Willis (7-3) worked seven innings for Florida, allowing four runs and seven hits. Willis, a former Cubs farmhand, struck out two and walked one. He also was a starter on the 2003 championship team that eliminated the Cubs in the playoffs. "It's turned into a rivalry since 03," Willis said. Chicago led 2-0 after three innings but the Marlins pushed across two in the fourth and three in the fifth. Miguel Olivo drove in Willingham with a sacrifice fly and Willis singled in Hermida in the fourth. Hermida hit a drive to right-center off Jason Marquis in the fifth for his third homer of the season. Chicago loaded the bases with one out in the ninth but Kevin Gregg struck out Cliff Floyd and Lee to earn his sixth save. "We still had a big lead," Gregg said. "Even though they had guys on base they still had to get a couple of more guys across to get in a bad situation. We just shut it down right there and ended the rally." Marquis (5-2) allowed five runs, four earned, and eight hits in five innings to get his first loss since April 10. He had won his last five decisions. "Starting with me, I need to play smarter. It's one thing to play harder, but there is no excuse to play dumber," Barrett said. Lee broke out of a 5-for-31 slump with a drive off Willis in the first inning. It was Lee's fourth homer of the season. He also doubled in Alfonso Soriano in the third inning to make it 2-0. "I thought he (Willis) just made two bad pitches," Marlins manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "Other than that, I think all the hits were ground-ball base hits going through the infield." Notes:@ The Marlins have beat the Cubs six straight times, dating to last season. ... All of Lee's homers this season have come at Wrigley Field. ... Willis allowed his first homer of his career at Wrigley Field in 33 2-3 innings. ... Willis was 2-for-3 with an RBI.

Hewitt, a former number one whose game is coming together again, is on the opposite career track of Argentine Gaudio, whose form has slid badly since his highlight Roland Garros title three years ago. The 28-year-old Argentine has had a misery season with reports of retirement also being considered. The 14th-seeded Hewitt may have hastened that process with his fight-back second-round victory in three hours, 28 minutes. On his back foot in the early stages against Gaudio, who came in with 21 Roland Garros wins, Hewitt dug in for the kind of tennis scrap that he appreciates. With Davis Cup captain John Fitzgerald looking on, the former US Open and Wimbledon winner got himself back into contention as he claimed the third set after two hours and 17 minutes of battle. It took another hour-plus for the Aussie to move through, piling on three love games in the deciding fifth set and advancing on the first of three match points to lift his record at the event to 21-7. Sixth seed Novak Djokovic had to overcome a bout of negativity before knocking out the lowest-ranked player remaining in the draw, reaching the third round 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 over Laurent Recourderc. "I'm not so happy with my two performances here," said Djokovic. "But the positive thing is that I've won two matches, two rounds. "It was not easy, I'm favourite even in the next match (against Olivier Patience of France). So I'll try to do my best and start playing better." The Serb was joined as a winner by former Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis, with the 16th seed defeating Dane Kristian Pless 7-5, 6-3, 6-4. "It was a tricky match today," said Baghdatis, based in the city where he learend his tennis. "The 11 a.m. start changed by rhythm of sleeping, waking up early in the morning. "In the first couple of games, I didn't feel good going on court. I was a bit stressed. Slowly, slowly I found the rhythm and the way to win. So that's the most important thing." Djokovic kept pace as he pulled level with Rafael Nadal on 37 season wins, the most on the ATP. Qualifier Recourderc, ranked 306, showed spirit but was ultimately overpowered by the young talent who cracked the Top five for the first time a month ago. Roland Garros was the venue of Djokovic's best Grand Slam showing when he reached the quarter-finals a year ago, retiring with a back injury after two sets against Nadal. He has also three titles so far this season - the same as Roger Federer and second behind Nadal on four. Djokovic fired five aces and broke six times as he advanced on a dry and partly cloudy day at Roland Garros after a week of rain interruptions. In women's play, the Serbian momentum was boosted by seventh seed Ana Ivanovic, who beat Sania Mirza of India 6-1, 6-4. Swiss 14th seed Patty Schnyder moved through to the third round over Kateryna Bondarenko of the Ukraine 6-3, 6-2. The Post Publishing Public Co., Ltd. 2006 Printed display ad enquiries to:

Salem-News.com is the Publisher of Frontline-News Pahlsson Goal Gives Ducks 2-0 Stanley Cup Lead The Senators never were able to mount much of an offensive challenge in Game 2, being out-shot 31-16 in the game. ANAHEIM, Calif. - Sammy Pahlsson, a finalist for the Selke Trophy as the NHLâ€™s top defensive forward, was the offensive hero for Anaheim Wednesday night, scoring the lone goal of Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Final as the Ducks blanked the Ottawa Senators, 1-0, to grab a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. Pahlsson took advantage of a neutral-zone turnover by Ottawaâ€™s Dany Heatley to gain the Senatorsâ€™ zone with some speed. Racing past Daniel Alfredsson, Pahlsson snapped a shot from the dot of the right circle through the legs of defenseman Joe Corvo and past the stick side of goalie Ray Emery for the goal at 14:16 of the third period. â€Well, the goal was a turnover,â€ Pahlsson said. â€œI skated down the wing and stepped once inside and shot it through the legs of the defenseman and somehow, it went in.â€ There was no somehow about it. The shot was a big-time effort that slipped inside the far post. â€That line from the beginning of the year have been able to give us quality minutes,â€ Ducks coach Randy Carlyle said of the Pahlsson, Rob Niedermayer, Travis Moen unit. â€œAnd as you know in the playoffs, everybody steps up the defensive aspect of the game at least 20 to 25 percent. And always, people separate themselves on the offensive side. Itâ€™s nice to see that these three players are getting rewarded for hard work. â€The one thing about those guys, the play the tough minutes and a lot of time the spotlight has not been directed toward them. Right now, theyâ€™re earning that.â€ Losing the game was a bitter pill for Emery, who was fabulous in defeat and was deserving of a better fate. After a 3-2 loss in Game 1, Emery said he would be better, and he was. The Senators, who put some pressure on the Anaheim goal late, never were able to mount much of an offensive challenge in Game 2, being out-shot 31-16 in the game. â€It was a great shot,â€ Senators coach Bryan Murray said of Pahlssonâ€™s game-winner. â€œHe got Corvo turned around. He tried to do something with the stick, got spun, and he used Corvo as a screen and hit inside the post. Great shot. Great play on his part.â€ Now, the Senators have to battle history as well as the Ducks. Of the 30 home teams who have won the first two games of the Stanley Cup Final since the series became a best-of-seven affair in 1939, 29 have gone on to capture the Cup. The Sens will now call upon the ghosts of the 1971 Montreal Canadiens, who came back from the 0-2 deficit to win in seven games. Goalie J.S. Giguere was his indomitable self for the Ducks, getting to every shot that came his way. He has allowed just two goals in two games of the Final, while Emery has surrendered four goals in two games. Giguere was at his best during a multiple-save flurry during a 5-on-3 advantage for Ottawa. â€I just wanted to make sure that I would approach it with a lot of energy,â€ Giguere said. â€œI thought I was able to do the first save and guys were on the rebound right away. So, we got pretty fortunate that we were able to get out of that one with no goals.â€ Pahlsson is making quite a name for himself in this Final series. Known as a defensive whiz, his line, along with Niedermayer and Game 1 hero Moen, has made the Sensâ€™ top line of Alfredsson, Heatley and Jason Spezza disappear. â€Well, you know, we obviously want to focus on that top line and our checking line has done a great job of being physical against them,â€ Anaheim defenseman Chris Pronger said. â€œMaking them work inside on the puck and making them play defense. It's the best way to counteract offensive players.â€ â€Weâ€™re definitely counting on a couple of guys to be big-time players for us,â€ Murray said of his top scorers. â€œAnd they played much better tonight. But they didnâ€™t create much in the way of offense. Iâ€™m hoping when we get home, we can do a little juggling and it will come. â€But yeah, Iâ€™m concerned,â€ Murray continued. â€œThey have to help us win games on the road, as well as at home.â€ â€We've been scoring to this point and we're expected to score goals,â€ Spezza said. â€œIt's not a lack of effort. We're trying. We're getting pucks. We did a little better job of getting pucks on net and deep today. We didn't score those early goals. We know we have to be better, though.â€ The Senators now hope home cooking pays some dividends, returning to Ottawa for Game 3 Saturday night (8 p.m. ET, NBC, CBC, RDS, NHL Radio) and then again on Monday night as they try to get back into the series. â€Well, it's disappointing to not get a win down here,â€ Senators defenseman Chris Phillips said. â€œBut we can't hang our heads. There's a lot of pride in this room and we're going home now. We've got two games at home to even out the series.â€ â€We've kind of done our job,â€ Pronger said. â€œWe've won our two home games, and let's face it, you're supposed to win your home games. Now it's in their court. We're going to expect, obviously, a tougher environment in their building, and certainly their crowd will be behind them and cheering them on. So it will be a difficult atmosphere for sure.â€ Emery kept the Senators in the game in the second period as Ottawa was out-shot 14-4 in that period and 26-11 over the first 40 minutes. The second period began like it was in a lull after the physical and fast first 20 minutes, but as the clock ticked off the seconds, the Ducks got their second wind and began to press the advantage around Emery. Rob Niedermayer saw a backhand shot stopped by Emery and Todd Marchant grabbed the rebound and dominated the remainder of the shift. Emery snapped out a right pad at 11:40 to deny a testing drive by Corey Perry. Emery then made another key stop on Rob Niedermayer at the 10:00 mark. The Emery show continued with 6:54 left in the second as the Senators goalie made a huge save on Perry and the ensuing stuffer from Rob Niedermayer. With defenseman Tom Preissing off for tripping at 18:04, the Ducks had the man advantage and Emery made a nice save and clear on a point shot from Chris Pronger. The hits just kept coming in the scoreless first period almost as if Game 1 never ended. So, too, did the parade to the penalty box that made both coaches unhappy in Game 1. Shots in the first were 12-7 for the Ducks as both goalies made several key saves, especially on power plays, to keep the period scoreless. Ottawaâ€™s Mike Comrie was boxed for boarding at 2:17 and the Senators were able to kill off the penalty without too much difficulty. Anaheimâ€™s Drew Miller was called for interference at 5:40, another man-advantage that didnâ€™t prove especially troublesome. Anton Volchenkov threw a thundering hit on Corey Perry at 8:05, but was called for boarding, opening the door for some testing shots by the Ducks. First, Ryan Getzlaf was denied off a slick feed from Teemu Selanne. Moments later, Getzlaf was stropped again by Emery who clamped his glove on the rebound. Emery then got his right shoulder on a point drive shot from Pronger and then threw out his right pad to deny Selanne late in the power play. The Ducks dodged a huge bullet when Shawn Thornton was called for charging at 12:31 and was followed to the box by Pronger for slashing at 13:24, giving the Senators a 5-on-3 edge for 1:08. In that span, the Senators threw everything at Giguere, who responded with some tremendous save, including multiple stops on Alfredsson and Mike Comrie. The crowd roared as Pronger returned to the ice to kill off the remainder of the penalty time. â€We have to stop taking penalties like that, especially going down five-on-three,â€ Giguere said. â€œWe canâ€™t afford to do that every game. Itâ€™s going to end up costing us some goals eventually.â€ Anaheim finished off the remainder of the first on the power play after Mike Fisher was called for roughing Corey Perry at 18:06, a power play that carried over to the second period.

Iavaroni will be named the Grizzlies head coach today. Associated Press file photo Iavaroni played with such legends as Julius Erving when he was with the Philadelphia 76ers. Iavaroni's work ethic and enthusiasm are unquestioned. By Marlon W. Morgan ORLANDO -- Because Marc Iavaroni has worked under such coaches as Pat Riley, Mike Fratello and most recently as the lead assistant coach to Mike D'Antoni with the Phoenix Suns, D'Antoni isn't quite sure what to expect when Iavaroni calls his own plays for the first time during the 2007-08 season. Iavaroni is expected to be announced as the Grizzlies new coach at a 2 p.m. news conference today. ''He's been in all kinds of different systems,'' D'Antoni said. ''He'll have to have his own players, but he'll have his own stamp on it. It'll be interesting to see.'' One thing D'Antoni is certain about, Iavaroni, 50, is more than ready for his first head coaching gig. Iavaroni, who has had other interviews in recent years, was one of the hottest assistant coaches on the market this season, with his name mentioned with several other coaching vacancies. ''I'm really, really elated for him,'' D'Antoni said. ''I think it's great. He's ready. He'll be a great coach. It's a good situation and I hope he does well. He's ready to go. He's been ready to go for a couple of years. The opportunity finally presented itself. Rightly so, he jumped all over it.'' Iavaroni is the candidate Grizzlies president of basketball operations Jerry West had targeted since Fratello was fired in late December. Although West would not confirm Iavaroni's hiring, he did say the Suns assistant would be a great addition to the Grizzlies. ''I just think he's a great, great candidate,'' West said. ''As a matter of fact, I thought he was the best one out there. That's my personal opinion and it's only my opinion. I've always been a fan. I think he's someone, if we're fortunate enough to get him, it'll be a good thing for us.'' Former NBA player and Denver Nuggets general manager Kiki Vandeweghe used to work with Iavaroni at Hall of Fame coach Pete Newell's big man's camp. They also played against each other during Iavaroni's seven years in the NBA. He, too, believes Iavaroni will be a good fit in Memphis. ''He's a great competitor,'' Vandeweghe said. ''I would think he would do a great job. Marc is a very smart basketball guy and has a lot of enthusiasm. He'll work very hard.'' D'Antoni said Iavaroni's strengths include his work ethic, attention to detail and his teaching abilities. He went on to say that Iavaroni's abilities, combined with the Grizzlies' young talent, which includes Pau Gasol, Rudy Gay, Hakim Warrick, Kyle Lowry, Alexander Johnson, Tarence Kinsey, and the fourth pick, in next month's draft, should be a nice mix. D'Antoni quickly pointed out the Suns were one of the youngest teams in the league three years ago. Iavaroni was instrumental in helping develop that talent, among them being All-Star Amare Stoudemire, into one of the top teams in the NBA. ''You have to have talent in this league to be successful, and they have the makings of a good team. Marc will help that alone. There'll always be some growing pains, but he'll do a terrific job. ... It takes time like anything else, but he'll do great with it.'' Iavaroni's hiring leaves the Grizzlies with one other vacancy to fill, replacing current president of basketball operations Jerry West, whose last day is June 30. Vandeweghe has interviewed with Grizzlies majority owner Michael Heisley. He said he has not had any further conversations, but remains interested in the job. ''As far as I know, they're still going through some diligence,'' Vandeweghe said. Another person believed to be a candidate is Suns vice president of basketball operation David Griffin, who works under D'Antoni, also Phoenix's executive vice president of basketball operations and general manager. ''He would be another good candidate,'' D'Antoni said of Griffin. ''He's another guy that's very smart basketball-wise. He's been great.'' When asked why the Grizzlies opted to hire a coach before a general manager, West replied, ''We've got a president of basketball operations. Things will be taken care of. There's a lot of things you guys don't know that go on, and you don't need to know until they're announced.'' -- Marlon W. Morgan Browse or search for print ads Find local sales and online deals!

Lowe pitched seven scoreless innings, reached base three times and scored a run to help Los Angeles shut out the Washington Nationals for the second straight game, 5-0 on Wednesday night. Lowe (5-5) gave up three hits, struck out five and walked two while allowing only one batter past first base. He combined with relievers Jim Beimel and Rudy Seanez on a four-hitter. "The final line score looked good, but it was a struggle," Lowe said. "The outs weren't coming easy. Early in the game, the stuff wasn't there, so you kind of have to grind it out." Lowe said it took some time to find his stuff, but that he felt more comfortable after the first few innings. He retired nine if a row at one point from the third through the sixth innings. "As the game went on, it seemed like I got a little bit better," Lowe said. "Today was just a day where I was fortunate to make one good pitch per at-bat." Washington manager Manny Acta didn't seem to think Lowe had very much trouble. "He's pretty tough," Acta said. "He's got to be off his game for you to do any damage and he wasn't." Lowe also helped at the plate. He entered the game with a .105 batting average but singled once, walked twice and scored a run, reaching base in all three plate appearances. The Dodgers haven't given Lowe much support at times this season, scoring three runs or less in five of his first 11 starts. But two of Lowe's at-bats led to runs. "I tell you what, Derek was good at the plate, too," Los Angeles manager Grady Little said. "He had a couple of big walks, a base hit that contributed to some of the run scoring. It was good to see him come away from there with a win. Maybe that will get him off onto a roll." Los Angeles opened the three-game series Tuesday with a 10-0 victory and got help from starting pitcher Brad Penny at the plate in that contest. He went 2-for-2, and the Dodger starters are 3-for-3 with two walks and a sacrifice in the first two games. Lowe took care of the first seven innings, and Beimel worked the eighth and Seanez pitched the ninth. Nationals starter Mike Bacsik (1-1) allowed six hits and four runs - two earned - in six innings. The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the fifth. Luis Gonzalez led off with a double and moved up when Russell Martin of Chelsea, Que., grounded out. Andre Ethier lined an RBI double and after Lowe walked, Rafael Furcal singled home a run. Martin hit a two-run homer in the sixth for a 4-0 lead. The Dodgers got a break when Nationals shortstop Cristian Guzman misplayed Jeff Kent's one-out grounder, and Martin's two-out homer gave Los Angeles a pair of unearned runs. "I think pitching has been holding us together this year," Martin said. "(But) hitting's going to come along. We've got some guys that hit for a lot of years, and we've got some young guys who can do it, too." Lowe got a one-out walk in the fifth against reliever Ray King and later scored on Nomar Garciaparra's infield single for a 5-0 lead. The Nationals' recent offensive problems continued as they didn't even threaten. They last scored a run in the eighth inning Sunday in a loss in St. Louis. This was the first time the Nationals have been shut out in consecutive games since May 16-17, 2006, against the Chicago Cubs. Notes: Furcal has a 15-game hitting streak, tying his career best. ... Los Angeles improved to a season-best 10 games over .500. ... The Nationals are just 7-18 against teams outside the NL East. They are 14-14 against the NL East.

"You have to clean the air once in a while," said. "It's gets a little polluted at times. I think we all needed a breath of fresh air." who called the meeting, didn't want to discuss his role in it but said the reason was "obvious." "We're not playing well," he said. "[Tuesday] night was not a good game at all. We just have to turn it around. We have too good a team to be in the situation we are. We need to find a way to make it better." said he spoke to Lee after Tuesday's game about a meeting but said it was Lee's idea. "Obviously, if the team was playing really, really well, there wouldn't be a meeting," Piniella said. "You don't have meetings if you're on an eight-game winning streak. Sometimes it's good for players to talk out things without the manager and the coaches." said Tuesday, Floyd conceded the players had been playing "tight." "You start choking a little bit, start feeling not good about yourself," Floyd said. "If we didn't have a good team, I wouldn't be talking to you all right now. I'd tell you to move on. We have a good team." was given Wednesday off to get his head back together after making mental lapses behind the plate in Los Angeles and on the bases at Wrigley Field. "Just giving him the day off," Piniella said. With an off day Thursday and starting Friday against Atlanta, Barrett likely will get three days off to recover. Piniella soon must decide whether to play a more defensive-minded catcher in over Barrett, an offensive-minded catcher whose average is down to .244. flew to Delaware to consult with surgeon who operated on his right shoulder after the 2005 season. The Cubs said Miller was not injured but wanted to get Morgan's advice on whether he should continue his two-year comeback. Miller's minor-league rehab stint is over, and he will have to decide whether to try to come back after being optioned to the minors or to retire. The Cubs have made Miller available, but there have been no takers. They are responsible for his $1.5 million salary whether he pitches again or not.

According to a report on the web site Wednesday, Mark Cuban is slated to be an owner of a team in the United Football League. The league hopes to rival the NFL. Lining up with Larry Our NFL Czar: News and notes Adam Schein on hot topics Breakdowns of major moves Czar: No compassion for Vick Schrager: Ranking the off-seasons Schein: A sad situation Rookies and vets mix Bill Hambrecht, a Wall Street businessman, and Tim Armstrong, a senior executive at Google, have decided to start up a rival football league, the United Football League, according to a report on the For those worried that the UFL will lack name recognition, Hambrecht and Armstrong already have one owner lined up: Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks. And though the league is having a difficult time finding other owners, it appears Cuban is committed to the plan. The league intends to play its first preseason games in August of 2008. And where will the league find the talent necessary to attract fans? "(Former NFL coach) Bill Walsh used to tell me that the last 20 players cut from every team were almost interchangeable with the last 20 players to make the team," Hambrecht says. So far, the UFL has decided to put teams in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Mexico City. Cuban, unsurprisingly, is considering buying the team in Vegas, according to the report.

(Photos, from left: Rebecca Cook/Reuters, Jim Ruymen/Reuters, Mark Humphrey/AP, Lisa Blumenfeld/Getty Images) UPDATE, 4:55 PM ET: Kobe Bryant did away with all the diplomacy this afternoon, during a radio interview in New York. Asked if there was anything the Lakers could do to keep him, he responded: &#8220;No, bro.&#8221; More on what he said and the possible deals that would send him away at TrueHoops The N.B.A. playoffs may be registering several levels of excitement below frenzy among basketball fans, but the Lakers are trying to make up the difference off the court by tossing together a whistle-blowing star, an owner in jail and a swimsuit model in a Lakerland rumor mill unrivaled since Shaquille O&#8217;Neal left town. . The man often mentioned as the best player in the league is carrying on a furious public campaign to shake up the team and restore the general manager who stepped aside in 2000. , the former G.M. of the Lakers and current Memphis Grizzlies president is reportedly livid with Bryant for dragging him into the fray, according to a Yahoo story. He also considers the current G.M., , a protege and friend. Mr. West&#8217;s friendship with the Lakers coach, At the top of all of this is , the Lakers controlling owner and head of a family that runs the team with all the transparency of the Kremlin, according to a blog called Forum Blue &#038; Gold . Its analysis of public statements from three members of the Buss family concludes with signs that &#8220;power is shifting some.&#8221; Mr. Buss &#8220;is giving up some of his and everyone is fighting for parts of it,&#8221; particularly his son and and his daughter, Jeanie, who had a five-year romantic relationship with Mr. Jackson. As all of this unfolds, Buss, 74, was arrested last night for driving under the influence. Oh, and he was driving on the wrong side of the road with a 23-year-old swimsuit model in the passenger seat, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported . He was later released and a court date was set. It was plenty of material for the Los Angeles Times columnist T.J. Simers All right, who drove Jerry Buss to drink? His son? His daughter? His star player? Did someone tell him Smush Parker wants to return? I&#8217;ll tell you this, because I just know you&#8217;re going to ask, the young lady in the car with Buss when he was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence was old enough to drive. I can also report that her first name was not Paris or Lindsay. (That fellow named Smush is the only Laker certainly not returning next season Getting tossed back Bryant&#8217;s way are reports that he&#8217;s demanded a trade in a post headlined &#8220;The Truth,&#8221; in what he called the &#8220;truth section&#8221; of his Web site. (It &#8220;was created for times such as these,&#8221; he said). [ : Bryant has published a new post about his trade demand. Yes, it is also &#8220; It was one of many places that the master of spinning , fading away and scoring could be seen word-spinning away. &#8220;I&#8217;m not demanding anything,&#8221; he told the Riverside Press-Enterprise . &#8220;I&#8217;m just making a suggestion.&#8221; Restrained expectations such as those may be what&#8217;s in order. Howard Beck of The New York Times says that Kobe Bryant&#8217;s bid is a long shot 39 comments so far... I say trade the spoiled brat. Everyone wants to play on a winning team, and he&#8217;s had his share of good times with the Lakers. Life doesn&#8217;t always give us the chance to demand change just because things don&#8217;t go our way. Kobe&#8217;s reputation for his off-court antics have hurt the Lakers, anyway. â€” Posted by Patsy Robrego I am sure that you are on top of it but here is some more&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. â€” Posted by D 2 the B I agree with those that say trade the guy - he is the male version of lohan & hilton - ok, he is very talented, but instead of handling this crisis &#8220;off line&#8221;, he is trying to use the media to blow this thing sky high, and make it almost impossible for Mr. Buss not to trade him. It seemed to me that he had grown up a bit, after the rape accusation and publicity a few years ago. I guess he decided to get publicity the easy way, since the Lakers were eliminated by the Suns and had no shot at another title. â€” Posted by dave I&#8217;d say keep him and bench him for every last second of his contract. It may seem like a waste of money, but it is a fitting punishment. â€” Posted by Solidad Kobe needs a fresh change of scenery. But Kobe also needs a change of attitude. Kobe is THE best player in the NBA bar none! His idol M.J. had some decent players around him, as all the great players you can think of did. I would love to see him tone it down soon break Wilt Chamberlain&#8217;s 100 pt game; and win a Championship the same year. With this guy I believe it is possible. â€” Posted by joe Kobes problems on an off the court cannot be blaimed on him, the lakers promised him a rebuilt team after the departure of shaq. In his view, and in mine, the lakers are in violation of his contract. â€” Posted by nick Ummmm&#8230;who care about Kobe, the Lakers, or the NBA now or ever? The Stanley Cup finals are on and highlight the major differences between the NHL (good) and the NBA (bad). I can&#8217;t wait until Fitty Cent or some other two-bit rapper buys his own NBA franchise. Long live the NHL! â€” Posted by Thor von Loewen I have always felt that Kobe Bryant missed out by not spending at least one or two years in college before turning professional. It is obvious to me that the guy is immature.What with his rape charges in Colorado, and also the fact that he could not realise that the way to be successful in a team-sport like basketball is to work well with others.More so basketball, where one starter is 20% of the team, and a starter like Shaq, it can be argued, is almost 40%. Magic Johnson was able to co-exist with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, because he wanted to win, and Kareem was part of that winning formula. Kobe got Shaq traded, and now he has to live with it and just shut up. If you are not mature enough to realise that you do not have to have great personal relationships with people you work with, and who can make you successful beyond your dreams, then live with it and stop giving ridiculous interviews as to how you want to be traded. â€” Posted by Lucas He&#8217;s not spoiled, he&#8217;s an ALL-STAR, He&#8217;s changed his style of play to allow the rest of the team to excell, and they haven&#8217;t shown that they can do that. He&#8217;s accustomed to winning games and thats not what the team is doing. He was promised a team which could contend, which has yet to be the case. Hell if I were him, I would demand a Trade as well. I&#8217;m surprised other players aren&#8217;t doing the same on other under performing teams. Did I mention that the lakers are getting warm bodies in seats mainly on his name. Hell I live in NYC and only go to Knicks games when Kobe, Wade, or Agent &#8220;0&#8243; play. Bring Kobe to NYC, you&#8217;ll have a few hundred new season ticket purchases and constant soldout games. â€” Posted by Asa This reminds me of some reality TV show, can someone get them their own, it is LA after all, or maybe they could be on MTV&#8217;s the &#8220;Real World.&#8221; A 74-year-old and a 32-year-old model â€” viagra? Just don&#8217;t quote me on it. â€” Posted by Alex Morales Already posted, but I would also accept a Trade to the Nets.. When they move to Brooklyn, they&#8217;ll be the best team in the East with the addition of Kobe&#8230;.plus my property value will sky rocket&#8230;.. Lets Go Kobe&#8230; Lets Go Nets&#8230;.. Lets go Brooklyn â€” Posted by Asa Kobe signed a contract. Jerry Buss should make him honor it. It&#8217;s high time somebody reminds players that they must live up to the terms of agreements they negotiate and sign. â€” Posted by Mark He has reason to be pissed. And so do I, as a Laker fan. Kobe&#8217;s not the only one who was told that they would aggressively get back to the top. All of us were. I guess it finally sunk in to Kobe that the Lakers were turning in to the Florida Marlins, and that Jim/Jerry Buss didn&#8217;t have the balls to admit it. So they acted like victims, saying that the current situation was what Kobe wanted. So he&#8217;s had enough. But I guess you kobe-bashers want Kobe to be little lemmings like you are (should you getting coffee for your manager now, or at least laugh at his jokes?). You can&#8217;t relate to someone like that. Or worse, you think Hockey is a sport (as opposed to an excuse for 6th grade dropout, alcoholics to fight). â€” Posted by Steve from LA I wonder if all these blame Kobe guys have read the interview, shaq&#8217;s comments, and some of those from the columnists. It all points to Buss wanting to manke money aka Donald Sterling instead of going after Boozer, Kidd, or host of others. I also wonder if the above 5 or so reactions &#8212; all against Kobe have some incling of &#8216;a black superstar should be quiet and happy employee&#8217;. If Peyton Manning or Tom Brady were wronged like this and raked in the media and defended themselves with the what seems to be ther truth would fans react as above. A non-Kobe, non-Laker fan &#8211;Nets, actually. â€” Posted by HSP I wouldn&#8217;t think any team that already has enough good players in place to contend for a championship would want him at what is sure to be a high price. He comes with a lot of baggage, and needs the ball ALL the time. â€” Posted by Matt Cutugno TRADE HIM TO THE KNICKS. â€” Posted by webster bivens Jordan he is not. â€” Posted by APB Kobe goes, stays, plays or quits. Who cares? The NBA is yesterday. â€” Posted by Rocket Ronn Hey, Thor! You think NHL players can&#8217;t act like spoiled entitled brats? What about all the times that the US Olympic Ice Hockey team(largely made up of NHL players) doesn&#8217;t medal (or gold medal), and they huff off in a pissy fit? And what&#8217;s with implying that being a fan of basketball is synonymous with being a fan of rap? You DO understand the deeper implications of your statement are, don&#8217;t you (they&#8217;re racist, in case you didn&#8217;t). In any case, though, Kobe is a spoiled entitled brat. He even was in high school, when he demanded to be allowed to park in the faculty parking lot when other students were strictly forbidden. That doesn&#8217;t make him a bad player, though. Just a whiny one. â€” Posted by KES O.K., listen up everybody, because this is the bottom line on Kobe: Who cares? Sure he&#8217;s a superstar, but he is also an idiot. I prefer my sports heros playing their chosen sport, not exposing their mental midgetry. A fitting ending for Kobe should be for him to end his career with the Knicks, over the cap and unable to give him the championship he so desires. Playing for Isiah and the Dolans must be the equivalent of going to Hell. â€” Posted by Lee Blair I&#8217;m not going to argue with you on whether or not you think hockey is a sport; it&#8217;s obvious that if your misconceptions of that game run so deep, it&#8217;s a lost cause. What I can and will observe is that the Commissioner of the NHL hasn&#8217;t had to ask his players to leave their guns at home. â€” Posted by JN It&#8217;s amazing that some people will always think the worse of Kobe no matter what happens. Even when Shaq says he believes Kobe &#8220;1000%&#8221; when he says Kobe didn&#8217;t instigate his departure trade (and that Buss was responsible) people still won&#8217;t cut Kobe any slack. Also, another point I want to explore is that Kobe-haters often refer to Kobe as a rapist, yet I noticed that those same people &#8220;felt bad&#8221; for the Duke lacrosse team this weekend (when they lost to Hopkins in the National Championship) whose members (3 of them) were also accused of rape. I know the &#8220;race&#8221; card may be played out but why is it that people (especially white suburbia) are so willing to sympathize with white athletes over black athletes. I find this extremely hypocritical especially after reading blogs where people are so readily criticizing athletes in trouble like Pacman Jones, Michael Vick, etc&#8230; WITHOUT considering the defendant&#8217;s circumstance while standing up for white athletes (Duke lacrosse, Patrick Kerney) in similar situations. â€” Posted by Arthur Didn&#8217;t Kobe wanted to get traded at the same time that Shaq was traded to the Rockets? What happened? To the less knowedgeable it appeared that Kobe got tired of being second to Shaq. Now it is proven that he is second to Shaq. I say that its time that he acts like basketball is a team sport and that he is not the king of basketball, that&#8217;s Lebron James. Grow up Kobe. Don&#8217;t you think its time? â€” Posted by Sandra Let&#8217;s go back to right after the Lakers lost to the Pistons in 2004. Kobe said he wanted to &#8220;run&#8217;n Gun,&#8221; like the Lakers of Old. Buss wasn&#8217;t going to pay Shaq 30 million for 1 year, considering his weight problems at the time. Jackson&#8217;s offense wasn&#8217;t built around fast breaks, but on half-court movement. Phil wasn&#8217;t going to change his offense and Shaq said he wasn&#8217;t going to be a Laker with out Phil. An easy way out for Buss who didn&#8217;t want to pay Shaq anyways. Was Kobe used by Buss? Of course he was! But that doesn&#8217;t mean Kobe wasn&#8217;t complicent in the soap opera either. He didn&#8217;t want Shaq on the team either. Now, no one has ever questioned Kobe&#8217;s desire to win; he just wants to do it HIS WAY! Where other people help out just enough that his fragile ego doesn&#8217;t ger bruised. Where you have four or five guys chipping in 13-17 a night while Kobe gets 40-50. Where all his bricks get rebounded by post players who can score the aforementioned 13-17 on garbage and not take away from Kobe&#8217;s set shots. Face it, Laker fans, Kobe may have matured off the court, but he is still selfish on it. Where ever Kobe goes he will NEVER WIN A TITLE as long as he thinks everyone is supposed to help him, and not the other way around. Oh, BTW, Shaq ends up smelling like a rose, doesn&#8217;t he? A Laker fan who put the &#8220;Forum Blue and Gold away until Kobe takes his off.&#8221; Lets start rebuilding. â€” Posted by jason E. Yeah, that Kobe&#8217;s a whiner, nothing but trouble. Immature with a capital &#8220;I.&#8221; Rest of the NBA should just stay away, and let him go to Sacramento where he really belongs. I mean, we could unload the whole roster and just start over with Kobe (that big whiner). That vicious Kings-Lakers rivalry from the Shaq era is just &#8216;bygones.&#8217; Kobe will love it here.

Today it&#8217;s about money. Nothing else. The game doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s all about money. Too bad. â€” Posted by randall Also, another point I want to explore is that Kobe-haters often refer to Kobe as a rapist, yet I noticed that those same people â€œfelt badâ€ for the Duke lacrosse team this weekend (when they lost to Hopkins in the National Championship) whose members (3 of them) were also accused of rape. I know the â€œraceâ€ card may be played out but why is it that people (especially white suburbia) are so willing to sympathize with white athletes over black athletes. I find this extremely hypocritical especially after reading blogs where people are so readily criticizing athletes in trouble like Pacman Jones, Michael Vick, etcâ€¦ WITHOUT considering the defendantâ€™s circumstance while standing up for white athletes (Duke lacrosse, Patrick Kerney) in similar situations. â€” Posted by Arthur You are so right my friend. Kobe want more wins not a 7th place team. with smuch parker, terrible brown in it he wants to win and stop hating on the dude kobe a rapist yeah the duke lacrosse player were as innocent as kobe was so shut up and talk about the true subject â€” Posted by Ludger Kudos to Kobe for wanting to win&#8211;because the Lakers aren&#8217;t showing that they care about anything other than filling seats. With him there, they always will. I don&#8217;t blame him for responding to the leaked/planted story that he was the reason Shaq left. He&#8217;s had enough. Mitch Kupchak hasn&#8217;t assembled a winning team for years, so why shouldn&#8217;t he be gone? Of course, it would have been better had Kobe not mentioned Mr. West, but someone else would have. I&#8217;m not sure he has the energy for the game anymore. People always whine about the players are just about the money, but Kobe had a taste of winning, and simply wants it back. What a shame to see &#8220;showtime&#8221; reduced to this. It&#8217;s no secret Mr. Buss likes the younguns. Just read &#8220;You&#8217;ll never make love in this town again&#8221;, in which he has a starring role. â€” Posted by ej Former Oakland teammate of Reggie Jackson, Darold Knowles: &#8220;There isn&#8217;t enough mustard in the United States to cover that hot dog. Every player in the league laughs at him, but as long as he does what he does what he can do, I don&#8217;t care if he craps on the roof.&#8221; Bring him to New York. He and the Dolans deserve each other. â€” Posted by Blue & Orange Kobe didn&#8217;t need to go public&#8230;but that&#8217;s the sports world we live in&#8230;where stars are bigger than their teams. Unfortunately for the Lakers - they havne&#8217;t made a splash with Mitch Kupchak as the GM. Lakers have been too loyal to a guy who has done nothing to improve the team. â€” Posted by Jim I think Kobe going public is a sign that No one in the organization is treating him like the super star that he is. So to fight back he just blew it out of proportion. Life can be frustrating when you got what it takes to get there but you&#8217;re still here. So to sum it up, that&#8217;s the kind of situation Kobe finds himself in. However, Kobe can get whatever he wants, the same way he takes whatever shot he could on the court. â€” Posted by nickelson KB the best player in the league? Maybe if the game is 1-on-1. Otherwise, he belongs with David Thompson, George Gervin, Julius Erving, Pete Maravich and lots of other flashbulbs. Michael Jordan won with centers like Bill Weddington, Bill Cartwright and the big red-headed Australian galoot. Sure he had Scottie Pippen, but SP was a great second banana. Magic Johnson was great, in a different class altogether from KB. Kareem never won anything until Oscar Robertson showed up, and then the contest was a laugher. There&#8217;s such a thing as smart basketball, leveraging teammates. KB didn&#8217;t do it. Shaq&#8217;s record without KB proves whose championships those were. â€” Posted by Richard I dislike Kobe as much as anyone. But people are reacting as if contracts should never be renegotiated. A contract is not a moral promise. It is a deal. Both parties know that the other side may want out down the road, and at least in this case, they have a legitimate chance to negotiate for terms that will protect them if this occurs. It makes perfect sense to revisit the contract if the deal no longer suits the parties. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with negotiating for a release from the commitments of a contract, and that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s going on here. And hey, if the Lakers would take some of our sad sack players, I&#8217;d welcome Kobe with open arms.

If you&#8217;ve got so-called &#8220;former Kobe associates&#8221; spouting negative comments about KB then tell them to have the brass ones to include their names. Your cut throat story broke I guess before Shaq himself came out and said, &#8220;I support Kobe 1000% in what he has come out with&#8221;! Come on, Geek, get some real names and references and stop building your so-called stories on either innuendos or just plain BS! â€” Posted by John Widener Give Kobe what he wants. It&#8217;s his team and he&#8217;s the best shot at winning anytime soon. Kupchack, Dr. Buss, and Jim Buss need to clean their act up and do it quickly. Because of their incompetence the Lakers are wasting the peak years of one of the best players to ever enter the NBA. â€” Posted by Apratim (A Response to Poster #10) It sounds to me like Lakers owner Jerry Buss hasn&#8217;t given-up on his game&#8230;he&#8217;s still driving for the basket even if he does need an &#8220;assist&#8221;, as you suggest, in order to score. Where&#8217;s the foul? Can you blame him for wanting to put-it-up rather than hand-checking his way through the game&#8230;it&#8217;s a shame the whole team doesn&#8217;t share his competitive spirit.

Tyner, Twins sweep White Sox Jason Tyner and Torii Hunter discuss Minnesota's walk-off win, completing the three-game sweep over the White Sox. 's four-pitch, bases-loaded walk forced in the winning run with two outs in the ninth inning and sent the surging 7-6 on Wednesday for a three-game sweep. About 19 months after Chicago's World Series title, Guillen was so frustrated by another flat performance that during his latest rant he almost sounded resigned to losing his job. "I'm going to get fired? Good. Is this team going to get better having me out of there? I'd be too happy with it. But as long as I'm here, we've got to play better. As long as I'm here, we have to play better," Guillen said after the fourth straight loss by the Minnesota moved past Chicago into third place in the AL Central, rallying from a 6-1 deficit after 2 1/2 innings against by a combined 19-6 the first two nights, the won for the ninth time in 12 games thanks to a bunch of walks and bouncers - plus excellent defense and plain old good luck. "They compete as a team. They get you as a team, and that's why they win," said Guillen, who alternated between blaming himself and criticizing his players throughout his postgame remarks. Guillen has long been impressed by the , who sped by the slumping last summer on the way to their fourth division title in the last five years. But he pinned most of the afternoon's performance on the visiting team. "Offense, defense, pitching, manager, coaches, we all stink," Guillen said. (1-2) in the ninth, drew a one-out walk and moved to second when hit a chopper to for a possible double play. Konerko's throw grazed Tyner before hitting shortstop in the right knee for an error on the first baseman. "It was just a bad throw, not really a fluke," Konerko said. "I've made that play a million times." 's grounder deep in the hole, but his throw to second was not in time to force Punto. was summoned to face Hunter and walked the free-swinging slugger on four pitches to end the game. "I thought it was pathetic," Aardsma said. Hunter, who finished with three RBIs and leads the team with 45, wanted to swing the bat, of course. He lobbied for the green light when the count went to 3-0. "I saw the ump say, 'You need to come touch first base,' and I was like, 'Oh, OK,"' Hunter said. "I didn't know what to do. It was weird, man. That was something totally different. But I like it. We won." Chicago gave up 47 hits over the previous three games. While Garland allowed just five in six innings, the right-hander walked five and struck out only two. He took that 6-1 lead into the bottom of the third and walked the leadoff batter, . Punto and Cuddyer walked, too, loading the bases with one out and bringing a frustrated pitching coach, Don Cooper, out of the dugout. Morneau hit a sacrifice fly, and Hunter followed with a two-run double on the first pitch he saw to cut the lead to two. In the sixth, Garland gave up an RBI groundout to and an run-scoring single to that tied the game at 6. off the hook. After a stellar debut for Minnesota 11 days earlier when he replaced in the rotation, Baker has regressed in his last two starts. Some of his breaking balls missed the plate by a few feet and he gave up six runs and 10 hits in only three innings - including Manager Ron Gardenhire, however, was most disappointed by Baker's failure to cover first base when Morneau made a diving stop of Cintron's grounder in the second. "Those are things that you can't get away with at this level when you're trying to win ballgames," Gardenhire said. got away with it, though, by doing just about everything else right. (2-1) teamed up to throw six hitless innings in relief, and 's jumping catch against the left-field wall to take a homer away from in the top of the ninth highlighted a series of standout defensive plays in the late innings. "Guys start getting confident, and that's what happens," Gardenhire said. Of Minnesota's 26 runs in this series, 18 came with two outs. ... This was the final game as Minnesota's official scorer for Tom Mee, the first employee hired by the organization when the franchise moved from Washington before the 1961 season.

But it will be much more manageable if they have Scott Rolen and Jim Edmonds back. The two previously slumping sluggers continued their hot streaks on Wednesday night, joining with fellow "MV3" Albert Pujols to lead St. Louis to an 8-4 win over the Rockies at Coors Field. Pujols, Edmonds and Rolen combined for five extra-base hits and six RBIs, providing a much-needed boost to a lineup missing not only Molina but David Eckstein, Chris Duncan and Scott Spiezio. "Any time we play, when those three guys hit, we have a chance to score a lot of runs," said manager Tony La Russa. The offensive outburst provided Todd Wellemeyer with the support he needed to win in his first career Major League start. Wellemeyer lasted five-plus innings, allowing three runs on seven hits, striking out three and walking one. He looked shaky in the first two innings, but got through the next three without further damage. A leadoff homer in the sixth chased the right-hander. Rolen's RBI double in the first gave the Cardinals the lead, and Pujols scored on a wild pitch to make it 2-0. Colorado tied the game in the second, but Rolen doubled again in the fourth to score Edmonds, who had tripled. Edmonds picked up three-fourths of a cycle, missing only a double. Since May 14, Rolen is 17-for-47 (.362) with six doubles and a home run. He had six extra-base hits through the season's first six weeks. He has seven in the past two-plus weeks. "I haven't done much," he said. "I haven't lived up to my end of what I'm supposed to be doing. I understand that. I take responsibility. Right now I'm seeing the ball better, swinging better, and I'm being a little more selective. Hopefully I can continue that and everything will turn the corner for the whole team. I feel like I have a good base under me. I feel like my hands are working the way they should. And hopefully, I can stay consistent with that." For Wellemeyer, being handed a second lead was a boon. "That was huge," he said. "We went up 3-2, and I shut them down for three straight. Then we went up big time. So it was big." In the fifth, St. Louis broke the game open. A pair of singles set the table for Pujols, who drilled a three-run homer to center field. Edmonds followed with his fourth home run in his last six games. It was the first time all season that St. Louis hit back-to-back home runs. "We don't have but about 16 home runs between 10 of us, so I'm not surprised," quipped Edmonds. On the morning of May 8, Edmonds was batting .184 and slugging .253. Since then, he's 19-for-56 with six extra-base hits, for a .339 average and a .607 slugging percentage. "It's a long season," he said. I'm just trying to play catchup. Everybody's starting to put it together a little bit. We know that the three, four, five and probably six in this lineup have to produce for us to win." Wellemeyer finished the scoring in the big inning with a single that brought home Juan Encarnacion, who had doubled. That ended the night for Colorado starter Jason Hirsh, and made it pretty much a perfect night for Wellemeyer. "After today, I'm liking starting, getting some ABs," he said. "I love hitting." The Cards didn't score another run after the fifth, while Colorado threatened twice. After Jeff Baker's pinch-double in the seventh, So Taguchi made an impressive diving catch, then doubled Baker off to end the inning. Things got even scarier in the eighth. With two men on and the torrid Brad Hawpe at the plate, La Russa summoned Tyler Johnson -- who had permitted a homer to Hawpe one night earlier. Hawpe drilled a deep line drive that took Ryan Ludwick all the way to the wall, but Ludwick reined the ball in for the third out of the eighth. Jason Isringhausen turned in a 1-2-3 ninth. The win pulled the Cardinals back within 6 1/2 games of first-place Milwaukee in the National League Central. is a reporter for MLB.com.

The Ducks won 1-0. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) NHL notebook: Messier intrigued by N.Y. opening The Anaheim Ducks' defensive stalwarts are hurting the Ottawa Senators on offense, too. Samuel Pahlsson's shot beat Senators goalie Ray Emery with 5:44 left to give the Ducks a 1-0 victory over Ottawa on Wednesday and a 2-0 lead in the Stanley Cup finals. Pahlsson, a finalist to be the NHL's top defensive forward, joined linemate Travis Moen with winning goals in the series. They already mastered the job of shutting down Ottawa's high-flying top line and now are providing the finishing blows against the Eastern Conference champions. "We worked really hard the whole game for that one, but we couldn't get anything by Emery," Pahlsson said. "We just try to play our game, make it easy for us and hard for them. We got some goals and we don't expect that every game. It's fun." After a turnover by Dany Heatley, Pahlsson carried the puck down the right-wing boards, worked around Daniel Alfredsson, and let go a shot past defenseman Joe Corvo, who had his back to him. That matched Moen's winning tally that came with 2:51 left Monday. Saturday, the best-of-seven series will shift to Ottawa for the first time since 1927, and the Senators will have to figure out a way to break out of a scoring funk in the next two games to earn a trip back to Southern California. Teams that won the first two games at home have captured the Cup 29 of 30 times. Jean-Sebastien Giguere stopped 16 shots for his sixth postseason shutout and first this year. He leaped as time ran out and the loud duck call vibrated through a deafening arena. Emery made 30 saves for the Senators, who lost only once in each of their first three series. After a postseason low of 20 shots in the series opener, the Senators managed less of a punch in Game 2. But the game didn't lack exciting, tense play. Emery was brilliant and had the added bonus of a few quick whistles as he tried to freeze the puck. Senators Coach Bryan Murray complained after Game 1 that the Ducks delivered a few extra stick jabs after the whistle and the message was received by referees Bill McCreary and Brad Watson.

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070528.wsptduha28/BNStory/Sports/columnists&cid globeandmail.com: Duhatschek: Bettman points to game's improvements Letters to the Editor Duhatschek: Bettman points to game's improvements Globe and Mail Update May 28, 2007 at 8:08 PM EDT &#151; It wasn't a great time for the National Hockey League to take a week off last week, what with Rick Tocchet pleading guilty to running a sports-gambling ring; and the Nashville Predators getting sold to Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie. Then there was everyone's favorite snub &#151; how NBC, its national over-the-air rights holder in the United States, cut away from the deciding game of the Eastern Conference final to show what amounted to a Preakness pre-race show. Most people probably would have understood if the network had cut away from its hockey coverage to televise a two-minute race they were contractually obliged to carry. The fact that it sacrificed the overtime of a conference championship game to spend an hour reflecting on what happened to Barbaro in last year's race was too much for hockey fans to bear, contract or no contract. Accordingly, it took a brave man to set foot in front of the assembled media hordes Monday and extol the virtue of the product that he was selling. That was commissioner Gary Bettman's duty Monday and true to form, he stayed mostly on message &#151; that while things were not perfect, the NHL's challenges were "a mere fraction of what they were a few years ago." The most revealing moments came when Bettman talked about Canada and the possible return of the NHL north of the 49th parallel. Bettman essentially said the possibility of a return to the two markets that the NHL left in the 1990s &#151; Winnipeg and Quebec &#151; "intrigues me" and that while it isn't something they've studied, "it seems to me more likely than it was two, three, four or five years ago." Years ago, Winnipeg and Quebec lost their teams, largely for building reasons. Winnipeg's new facility might just make the grade by the NHL's current arena standards, while the old Colisee in Quebec most definitely would not. And in the case of either market, a deep-pockets' ownership group would be needed to underwrite the cost of the franchise. In the post-lockout NHL, the going price for a team &#151; based on last week's developments &#151; is $220-million, the price Balsillie was willing to pay to snag the Predators. Bettman spoke in very formal terms whenever Balsillie's name came up and one wonders if he imagines that Balsillie might become his Mark Cuban, a maverick willing to use his wealth and power to rock what is still a fairly wobbly NHL boat. Balsillie isn't in the lodge yet and the last time he tried to buy a team &#151; the Pittsburgh Penguins &#151; the deal broke down before a formal transfer was approved. Given what the sale price has done to franchise value, it is hard to imagine Balsillie not getting the required three-quarters approval from the board when the matter comes to a vote on June 19. It'll be harder still for the board members to restrain themselves from giving Balsillie a standing ovation. When Bettman was asked about the possibility of Tocchet's reinstatement, he answered that no decision would be made until after the league completes its own internal investigation into the case and Tocchet is sentenced by a New Jersey court. If body language and tone mean anything, things didn't look too promising for Tocchet. Nor did Bettman think much of my suggestion that Toronto needed a second NHL team. "I live in New York and I can tell you, there are downsides to multiple teams in a market." On balance, Bettman was poised and in control of the proceedings in his unofficial, semi-annual state-of-the-union address. It isn't his job to slag the league for which he fronts; and in fact, he was a little less Pollyanna about some of its problems and prospects than he has been in the past, when all was right with the league &#151; even if it wasn't. On U.S. TV, Bettman said, "obviously it could be better." On the Preakness fiasco, he said: "You can second-guess it. I do myself." He put the blame for a season that spills into June squarely on ownership, saying that most teams wanted to start the season later rather than earlier. The only other possibility would be to reduce the length of the schedule and currently, there was no appetite for that either. And for anyone thinking the end of Bettman's reign is near, they can think again. Bettman turns 54 next week and acknowledged that his current contract runs until he turns 60. He said he likes what he's doing and as long as his employers feel the same way, he isn't planning on going anywhere anytime soon. It is 14 years now with Bettman at the helm and within the first few years of his reign, the NHL lost teams in both Winnipeg and Quebec. There would be something serendipitous about a return to those markets in the latter years of his career. Intriguing too. "Sometimes intrigue is a fanciful notion," said Bettman, "but if the right circumstances presented themselves and there was interest in a real meaningful way, then we would have to seriously look at it."

The Memphis Commercial Appeal, citing an NBA source familiar with the negotiations, reported the hiring Wednesday. The Grizzlies have announced an afternoon press conference for Thursday to make a "major announcement." Iavaroni spent the last five seasons as an assistant with the Phoenix Suns. The last 3 1/2 years he served as top assistant to Suns' head coach Mike D'Antoni. Considered a defensive-oriented coach, Iavaroni has served on the staffs of Miami's Pat Riley and former Grizzlies head coach Mike Fratello. Fratello was fired by the Grizzlies after a 6-24 start to the season. Tony Barone Sr. took over on an interim basis for the remainder of the season. According to the Memphis Commercial Appeal, Iavaroni was a finalist for the position with Larry Brown, who most likely would have been the next head coach had Memphis secured one of the top two picks in the upcoming draft. However, despite having the best chance at the top slot, the Grizzlies fell all the way to fourth in the draft order.

That is one reason why the defending World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals are eight games under .500. Pujols and the Cardinals look to win consecutive road games for the first time in nearly two months on Thursday night when they finish a four-game series against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field. Pujols keyed a five-run fifth inning with a three-run homer and Todd Wellemeyer worked five solid innings in his first major league start Wednesday as the Cardinals snapped a three-game skid with an 8-4 win. Jim Edmonds also homered and Scott Rolen added two RBI doubles for St. Louis (21-29), which also ended a seven-game road losing streak. ''When those three guys hit, we have a chance to score a lot of runs,'' Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. The Cardinals became the last NL team to reach double digits in road victories. St. Louis hasn't won consecutive games away from home since it won four in a row April 8-11. Pujols knocked in more than one run for only ninth time in 50 games this season. He had 19 multiple RBI games at this point in 2006. ''We haven't swung the bats well this year,'' said Edmonds, who went 3-for-5 with the homer and a triple to raise his season average to .245. ''So we've gotten off to a slow start, and we've got a lot of making up to do.'' Wellemeyer, claimed off waivers from Kansas City on May 15, became the fourth Cardinals reliever to win as a starter, joining Braden Looper, Adam Wainwright and Brad Thompson - the team's three winningest pitchers this season. Thompson (3-1, 4.73 ERA) makes his fifth start of the season and second against Colorado (25-28). He limited the Rockies to one run and six hits in five innings on May 8, but did not factor in the decision. He has no record and a 1.80 ERA in five career appearances against Colorado. The right-hander wasn't particularly sharp Saturday against Washington, but still earned a victory after allowing three runs and 10 hits in 5 1-3 innings as the Cardinals won 8-6. St. Louis learned Wednesday that catcher Yadier Molina will miss four to six weeks with a fractured left wrist. Molina left Tuesday's game in the fourth inning after being hit by a foul tip an inning earlier. Backup Gary Bennett, who went 0-for-4 Wednesday and is batting .208, will receive most of the work in Molina's absence. Wednesday's defeat cooled off the Rockies (25-28), who were attempting to win eight in a row for the first time since a franchise-record nine-game run from Aug. 26-Sept. 2, 1997. Jason Hirsh was reached for eight runs and 10 hits in 4-2 3 innings on Wednesday after Colorado starters had allowed only 13 earned runs during the entire seven-game winning streak. Sinkerballer Aaron Cook (4-1, 4.11) has played a big role in Colorado's recent success. He has won four straight decisions and is coming off his first complete game of the season, a 6-1 victory at San Francisco on Saturday in which he limited the Giants to one run and five hits. Cook is 0-2 with a 6.75 ERA in four career starts against the Cardinals. The right-hander has struggled against Edmonds, who is 6-for-10 with two homers in their meetings.

New York state is poised to lift long-time restrictions on reselling tickets to sporting events, concerts and shows. The state Assembly has voted for the bill, and the Senate is expected to follow suit. Governor Spitzer could sign the measure by tomorrow, when the state's old anti-scalping law expires. Under the proposed rules, the state would stop capping prices for tickets sold on the secondary market. Scalpers would still be banned from selling tickets within 1,500 feet of large arenas like Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium. Smaller venues would get a similar 500-foot buffer zone. Brokers who sell large numbers of tickets would still need to get a license. But for the first time, it would be entirely legal for average fans to scalp their seats on the Internet.

( The Indians shelled Daisuke Matsuzaka and ended Boston’s season-high five-game winning streak with an 8-4 decision last night, but the Red Sox still finished May with a sparkling 20-8 record and, needless to say, maintained their huge lead in the AL East. Cleveland clipped Dice-K for two runs in the fifth and chased him with a four-run sixth highlighted by Grady Sizemore’s two-run home run into the visitors’ bullpen that gave the Indians a 6-2 lead. Matsuzaka (7-3, 4.83) gave up six runs on 12 hits in 5-2/3 innings in absorbing his first loss since April 17. He blanked the Indians for four innings on four hits before losing his touch. The Japanese import struck out four and didn’t walk anyone, throwing 106 pitches. But the 12 hits were a season high for any Sox pitcher. “I don’t think he located his fastball the way he has and the way you need to,” manager Terry Francona said. “He made a great pitch to get out of (fifth), but this lineup can hurt you. Even when he got outs, I thought he was misfiring.” Asked about his fastball command, Matsuzaka — speaking through an interpreter — said it wasn’t only his fastball, but all his pitches that gave him trouble. He said the stomach illness that forced him out of his last start after five innings in Texas (10-6 victory) wasn’t a factor. “I felt better right away, so it didn’t have any effect,” he said, smiling while saying he didn’t know what caused it. “I knew they (Indians) had a good-hitting lineup, and I tried my best to avoid extra-base hits. I tried to make adjustments in the game, but wasn’t able to. It’s a challenge. I don’t want to be a burden to my teammates. I hope to achieve a level of consistency.” Cleveland starter Paul Byrd (6-1, 3.57) earned the win, allowing two runs (one earned) on nine hits over six-plus innings. Byrd struck out only one batter, but threw 25 first-pitch strikes to 27 batters. Sixty-one of his 77 pitches were strikes. Byrd extended his streak of consecutive innings without walks to 43. “He threw a ton of strikes, it was about 80 percent at one time,” Francona said of Byrd. “We knew he wouldn’t walk anyone. You have to hit him to beat him. He is not going to give you anything.” Former Red Sox catcher Kelly Shoppach had a career-high four hits, including a solo home run, against his old teammates as Cleveland rattled 18 hits, tying Atlanta’s season high against Boston May 19. Travis Hafner had three hits, while he and Sizemore had two RBIs apiece. Mike Lowell, Dustin Pedroia and Jason Varitek had two hits each for Boston. The Sox threatened mightily in the seventh, loading the bases with none out on singles by Varitek, Alex Cora and Pedroia against Byrd, but the Cleveland bullpen came on to snuff out the threat. Right-hander Tom Mastny retired Coco Crisp when third baseman Casey Blake caught his foul pop at the edge of the visitors’ dugout. Mastny then struck out the sizzling Kevin Youkilis. Left-hander Aaron Fultz came on to retire David Ortiz on a soft liner to third after Big Papi brought the crowd of 37,091 to its feet with a blast down the right-field line that would have been a game-tying grand slam had it stayed fair. Cleveland added a pair of runs off reliever J.C. Romero in the eighth to push its lead to 8-2. Shoppach greeted Romero with a first-pitch homer off the Sports Authority sign in left, and Travis Hafner doubled home another run. Lowell belted a two-run homer off Roberto Hernandez in the eighth to cut Boston’s deficit to 8-4. The round-tripper was Lowell’s team-leading 10th of the season. Trot Nixon’s ground-rule double started the four-run sixth. David Dellucci followed with a double and Josh Barfield and Shoppach singles before Sizemore unloaded his ninth homer of the season, prompting Francona to bring on Kyle Snyder. Boston took the lead with an unearned run in the second inning. J.D. Drew reached on second baseman Barfield’s fielding error, scooted to third on Lowell’s wall double, and scored on a groundout to first by Varitek. After almost taking out the cameraman atop the left-field grandstand with a loud foul, Manny Ramirez doubled to right and took third on a wild pitch by Byrd in the fourth. He scored on Drew’s grounder to short, making it, 2-0, Boston. The Indians finally broke through against Matsuzaka in the fifth, scoring twice to tie the game at 2-2. Doubles by Sizemore and Hafner following a single by Shoppach were the key hits. Dice-K whiffed Ryan Garko on a 3-2 slider to get out of the inning. “We wanted to win that game, but we’ll take our nap (today’s off-day) and lace ‘em back up (tomorrow),” Francona said of the upcoming Yankee series.

Sometimes you have to step back. Sometimes you can try too hard," Cubs first baseman Derrek Lee said Wednesday. (Jeff Lewis/AP) Yanks snap slide with big win over Jays Tribe pound Dice-K in finale Weaver shaky but Angels rally D-backs sweep behind Johnson Zito dominant as Giants blank Mets A-Rod defends controversial shout Lowe, Dodgers blank Nationals Young brilliant; Greene powers Padres Shop for official Cubs gear Watch the Cubs on MLB.TV Come out to Wrigley Field in 2007 CHICAGO -- The Cubs, unexpectedly under .500 at this point in the season, held a 30-minute players only meeting before Wednesday's game, endorsed by manager Lou Piniella. "I think it's good," Piniella said Wednesday. "I talked to Derrek Lee about it last night after the ballgame. He talked to me about it, and I said I thought it would be a pretty good idea." "It's obvious," Lee said Wednesday. "We're not playing well. [Tuesday] night wasn't a good game at all. We have to find a way to make it better." On Tuesday, the Cubs lost, 9-4, to the Florida Marlins in a game Piniella said "might be our worst game of the year." Sloppy baserunning, untimely walks by relievers, and a lack of clutch hits all contributed to the loss, the seventh in the last nine games for the Cubs. "I don't think we're playing the way we should," third baseman Aramis Ramirez said. "What's happened this season nobody expected because of the lineup we have, the pitching we have, the money they spent and we're below .500. That's unacceptable. Hopefully we can turn things around today." "We want to win bad in here," Lee said. "Sometimes you have to step back. Sometimes you can try too hard." After Tuesday's game, catcher Michael Barrett, who was picked off at second base for the third out of an inning, said he needed to play smarter baseball. Unfortunately for the Cubs, every baserunning blunder is magnified when the team loses. "You're going to make mistakes," Lee said. "It's as simple as that. When you're not scoring runs, you have to bear down a little more." "Obviously, if the team was playing really, really well, there wouldn't be a meeting," Piniella said. "You don't have meetings if you're on an eight-game winning streak. Sometimes, it's good for the players to talk about things without the manager or coaches." The players weren't the only ones who met behind closed doors. Piniella had a nearly two-hour session with team president John McDonough, Crane Kenney, who is on the board of directors, general manager Jim Hendry and assistant general manager Randy Bush. Piniella called it a "constructive" meeting. "Everybody's on the same page," Piniella said. "Everybody wants to straighten things up and win baseball games. It's good to see. It has been a little frustrating. Everybody's on the same page and we'll just go forward." The Cubs entered Wednesday's game 22-28 and six games behind the Milwaukee Brewers in the Central Division. What's been troubling is that the team is 2-12 in one-run games, and the bullpen is 4-13. However, the team is third in the National League with a .267 average, seventh in ERA, and third in fielding. Statistically, they shouldn't be under .500. "We've lost a lot of tough games late in the game," Piniella said. "You start winning those games, you get more confident that you can win them. You've got to tack on runs. Those are important. Then, when you have leads, obviously you want to hold onto them. It's been a combination. "These kids are all trying. It's been frustrating, frustrating for everybody. A lot of times we've shot ourselves in the foot running the bases. Everybody needs to relax and do what they can do and not try to overdo." Roster moves were not discussed at the management meeting. "I've got the right mix out there," Piniella said. "It's just a question of getting the job done. I haven't asked for any more pitching, one way or another. I've got five starters and bullpen kids and some are experienced, and some are young. I'm fine with it all. I think our pitching basically has done a very representative job. We've let some games get away, but what are you going to do?" Cliff Floyd batted fourth on Wednesday for the first time. He was inserted between right-handed hitters Lee and Ramirez. "We talked about doing this a while back," Piniella said. "We'll try it and see what it looks like." "I think it's a good idea," Ramirez said. Floyd, one of the veterans on the team, said he's one of the players who needs to relax to turn things around. With one out in the ninth inning, the Cubs down 9-4, and the bases loaded Tuesday, he struck out. "We have a good team," Floyd said. "We have to believe in ourselves when we go out on the field. Like [Tuesday] night, that situation, I swung as hard as I could every time. I haven't done that in the last two weeks. I'm trying to do too much. Even if I hit a grand slam, we're still down by one. You beat yourself up about the whole at-bat. Then our star [Lee] does the same thing. That's our superstar right here. You get out of your element. For what?" It's a matter of being more patient, relaxing, and getting the job done, Floyd said. "We have to go out there and believe we can win from the first at-bat or first pitch of the game, and see how that works," he said. "If you put pressure on yourself, nothing will come out of it." Moving Floyd into the No. 4 spot could be the first step. Piniella has longed for a set lineup. "I've tried my [best] to play everybody and give everybody opportunities," he said. "It's getting to the point where we're going to have to get set. I can't do it at every position. We have to get to a point where we can get as set as we can possibly be. Just play the people who are getting the job done the best. "I've tried to be as fair and play everybody," Piniella said. "I've gotten to the point where the guys who are doing the best job are the ones who will get the most playing time. That's all I can do. I can't do any more." Because the bench is so important in the NL, Piniella has tried to give everyone playing time. The positions that are set are left field with Alfonso Soriano, first base with Lee, and third base with Ramirez. "We'll try to get as set as we can," Piniella said. "I might have to play different people at one or two positions. I don't know what else we can do. We've tried just about everything." Jason Marquis took the loss in Tuesday's game, his first since his second start of the season. He had won five straight decisions. "I just didn't make pitches when I needed to," Marquis said. "I've got to bear down when the situation gets tough like that." Marquis heard Barrett's comments and knew the catcher had shouldered the blame for the loss. "Mistakes like that are going to happen," Marquis said. "That's not the only reason we didn't win the game -- there were a lot of other reasons. Michael's a no-excuse guy. I don't think that was the turning point. "Everybody wants to live up to the expectations, especially on an individual basis. We have a lot of talent in this clubhouse and we're just not dealing right now. Everybody's trying to take it on themselves and trying to carry the team. It's tough to do that and do it by yourself. We just have to get things clicking on all cylinders." Barrett was not in the lineup Wednesday. "I'm just giving him a day off," Piniella said. Thursday also is an off-day. ...

Sports - Baseball - MLB: Yankee slugger in scandal Wed, May 30, 2007 QUOTE OF THE DAY Eligible Canadians for the MLB Draft: Yankee slugger in scandal A-Rod has sexy romp in Toronto According to the New York Post, New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez spent the night at a strip club in Toronto on Monday with a sexy blond, that wasn't his wife.(SUN PHOTO BY MARK O'NEILL) Blue Jays attack A-Rod So who was that blond? Return of Doc a boost Clark gets another shot Gibbons calls A-Rod 'bush league' New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez found himself in the middle of a scandal on Wednesday, after the New York Post ran a cover story on the all-star third baseman’s night out in Toronto with a sexy blond, who was not his wife. According to the Post, Rodriguez and the mystery woman spent Sunday night dining at a high-class steak restaurant, before hitting a local strip club and ending their night at the posh Four Seasons hotel, which incidentally was not the one his Yankee teammates had checked into for a three-game series against the Blue Jays. The rest of the Yankees were at the Park Hyatt, right across the street. The Post ran a photo of Rodriguez and his blond companion checking into the Four Seasons, which was reportedly around midnight. Rodriguez had little to say on the matter before Wednesday’s game against Toronto. “Absolutely no comment about anything personal and I certainly don’t think this will be a distraction to our team,” he told the Associated Press. Asked whether it would be a distraction to him personally, Rodriguez said, “No, I don’t think so.” Manager Joe Torre agreed: “When you get into that area, I think it’s over the line. It’s what people seem to think is important or seem to think they have to do. “In New York, there are so many more things that you talk about on a regular basis in addition to baseball,” Torre added. “When I took this job I certainly knew it wasn’t going to be about hitting and running and changing pitchers.” Torre said Rodriguez discussed the tabloid story with him. “Alex is a big boy,” Torre said. “I know how serious he takes his baseball. It really wasn’t an issue for me in the fact that he wouldn’t be ready to play tonight. “My job is to keep the distractions from carrying over onto the playing field,” Torre said. The slugger, who has a two-year-old daughter with wife Cynthia, has been a lightning rod for criticism since being dealt to the Yankees just prior to the start of the 2004 baseball season. Last July, prior to the start of a series against Toronto, The Post ran photos of Rodriguez suntanning topless in Central Park, hours before a game. In March his comments in Esquire magazine on teammate Derek Jeter sparked a controversy, when Rodriguez said: "He's never had to lead. He can just go and play and have fun. He hits second -- that's totally different than third or fourth in a lineup. You go into New York, you wanna stop Bernie (Williams) and (Paul) O'Neill. You never say, 'Don't let Derek beat us.' He's never your concern." Rodriguez’s late-night romp preceeded the Yankees' series-opening 7-2 drubbing against the Blue Jays and last night’s 3-2 loss, that was the struggling club’s fifth-straight defeat and 13th in their last 18 matches. To rub salt in the wounds the Jays Aaron Hill successfully stole home in the seventh inning, the first time in six years a Blue Jay has accomplished the feat. “It seems like we’re losing every way possible and tonight was no different,” outfielder Johnny Damon said following the game. At 21-29, the Yankees are tied for last in the American League East and are eight games under .500 for the first time since they were 11-19 on May 6, 2005, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Rodriguez is a combined 1-for-7 in the first two games of the series. Despite all the controversy, Rodriguez is leading the majors with 19 home runs and is on pace for career highs in both homers and RBIs.

Guerrero was 3-for-5 and scored twice to lead an offense that banged out 11 hits as the Angels won the series, 2-1. CHRIS PIZZELLO/THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Seattle starting pitcher Felix Hernandez didn&#8217;t have his best stuff Wednesday, allowing seven runs in six innings of a loss to L.A. ANAHEIM, Calif. &#8211; Both teams considered this something of a statement series, the chance to tell the other something it didn&#8217;t want to hear. So when the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim beat the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday, 8-6 &#8211; taking two games in this three game series &#8211; the message came across loud and clear. We have Vlad Guerrero and you don&#8217;t. Considering Guerrero began the night batting .542 with three home runs and eight RBI against Seattle this season, one might have suspected the Mariners already knew that. Then the Angels turned their right fielder loose on Felix Hernandez, and beat the Seattle ace on a night when the Mariners scored six runs. What happened? Guerrero happened. The 2004 American League Most Valuable Player singled, doubled and hit a game-breaking three-run home run against Hernandez, who saw his earned run average leap from 2.87 to 4.10. Far worse, from the Mariners&#8217; standpoint, the Angels&#8217; victory represented a two-game swing in the standings. Had they won, the Mariners would have flown home 31/2 games out of first place. Instead, they&#8217;re 51/2 back today. &#8220;We had a good trip, we went 6-4, but we had the chance to make it a great trip tonight and couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; manager Mike Hargrove said. &#8220;The way you beat this team is to get Reggie Willits and Orlando Cabrera out &#8211; the two guys hitting in front of Guerrero. &#8220;The last two nights, we couldn&#8217;t do that.&#8221; &#8220;Tonight was a battle, the hardest battle I&#8217;ve had to get through this year,&#8221; Hernandez said. What did Felix think of Guerrero? &#8220;He&#8217;s the best hitter in the game, the best I&#8217;ve ever faced,&#8221; he said. All night, it was a game of attack and counterattack, and solid young starters Hernandez and Jered Weaver were almost helpless to stop either offense. The Mariners got a run in the first inning, when Jose Guillen&#8217;s two-out single scored Raul Iba&#241;ez. The Angels countered with four runs in their half of the first, three coming on a Gary Matthews Jr. home run. And so it went, most of the evening. &#8220;I made a couple of mistakes in the first, a couple of bad pitches, and one of them was a three-run home run,&#8221; Hernandez said. &#8220;After that, I tried to hold it there, and our guys came back.&#8221; The Mariners pecked away but missed key opportunities. They scored twice in the fourth inning to make it 4-3 &#8211; but left the bases loaded when neither Jose Vidro nor Iba&#241;ez could push runs across. In the fifth, Seattle got a double from Ben Broussard, a two-out RBI double from Adrian Beltre and an RBI single from Yuniesky Betancourt, who was then caught stealing. That produced a 5-4 Seattle lead, and Hernandez &#8211; who hadn&#8217;t allowed a run since the first &#8211; appeared to have settled in on the mound. &#8220;I thought he rebounded real well after the first,&#8221; Hargrove said. &#8220;He put up zeros in the second, third and fourth innings.&#8221; Before Hernandez got an out in the fifth inning, that lead was gone. Willits walked, Cabrera singled and there he was, the man the Seattle pitching staff cannot seem to get out when it matters. Hernandez got ahead of Guerrero, who foul tipped what would have been strike three in and out of catcher Kenji Johjima&#8217;s glove. Given another pitch, Guerrero got a fastball up &#8211; and drilled it into the right field pavilion. &#8220;It was supposed to be in and it was over the plate,&#8221; Hernandez said. &#8220;He hit it way back.&#8221; Seattle tried to recover, and Iba&#241;ez doubled home a run in the sixth to make it 7-6, but after that the Angels&#8217; bullpen shut the Mariners down without a hit. One last chance arose in the ninth inning against closer Francisco Rodriguez, who walked Vidro to open the inning. Rodriguez then struck out Iba&#241;ez, struck out Guillen on a pitch in the dirt and struck out Broussard on another low pitch. &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how tough he is out there,&#8221; Vidro said of Rodriguez. &#8220;He can throw you a pitch right down the middle, then throw what looks like the same pitch &#8211; and it just breaks straight down. &#8220;I went up there taking pitches because we needed a baserunner to have a chance, and even taking those pitches was hard. He&#8217;s awfully tough.&#8221; Among the Mariners&#8217; 10 hits was a fourth-inning single by Ichiro Suzuki, extending his hitting streak to a career-best 23 consecutive games &#8211; one short of Joey Cora&#8217;s team record. He would have liked it to come in the second inning, when the Mariners opened up with back-to-back singles, then watched as Betancourt, Jose Lopez and Ichiro failed to move the runners up, let alone score them.

Unlike the most recent challenge -- the WWE-inspired XFL -- the United Football League is prepared to challenge the NFL at old-school football. But the bigger questions facing the new league are who will watch it and, more importantly, who will air it? The sports world was mildly abuzz Wednesday with the announcement that a rival league is forming to challenge the NFL. A league calling itself the United Football League includes such heavy hitters as one of the top dogs for Google Inc. and Dallas Mavericks renegade Mark Cuban as faceplates. The NFL declined comment on the matter, but thereâ€™s no reason for the NFL to be overly concerned about the potential new rival. Why? Where are they going to televise games? Both the NBA and NHL have shown why they arenâ€™t truly mainstream professional sports and each was on display last night. The NBA is at the conference championship level and if you want to see those games, you need to tune in cable channels like ESPN and TNT. Even worse is the NHL. Wednesday night was Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals and the game was carried on the cable network Versus â€“ which is hard for many casual cable TV viewers to even locate. Even when the league has broadcast games on NBC, an overtime playoff game was pushed over to Versus between the third period and the overtime. Why? So NBC could do pre-race coverage of the Preakness Stakes. In Wednesdayâ€™s Game 2, the 1-0 win by Anaheim was seen on Versus, while NBC carried two hours of a show called â€œMost Outrageous Momentsâ€ â€“ a collection of raucous bloopers and injuries. The same fate is likely to be true for the new UFL. Unlike the last attempt to challenge the NFL â€“ the ill-fated XFL â€“ football is intended to be the primary source of entertainment, not wrestlers cutting promos and cheerleaders that look like no strangers to a stripper pole. They come in with good intentions and hope to achieve the success that the AFL had as being a legitimate rival and the lesser success that the USFL enjoyed by enticing some of the top college stars away. The reality is that even the XFL attempted to make a splash in the football market, and it had a national TV contract with NBC. The NFL has successfully eliminated that loophole by incorporating all four of the major television networks in its latest TV contract as well as working its own NFL Network into the mix. CBS carries the AFC contract, FOX has the NFC contract, NBC has weekly Sunday Night games and ESPN (owned along with ABC by the Disney Corporation) holds the Monday night contract. If any of the major networks were to start carrying the UFL, the NFL could easily flex its muscle and threaten to take off the NFL in its next bid package. Having the luxury of being able to bid on contracts with your own network should be a frightening concept to anyone â€“ much less someone trying to fight against the league. Most people in the initial reaction to the UFL (aside from laughing) are saying that the league will be viewed as inferior because of the power and lure of the NFL. The belief is that the only players that will come out as blue-chip college prospects will be the greedy types that are more about money than playing football. The rest of the league will consist of players who â€œcouldnâ€™t cut itâ€ in the NFL. But more important is that, with the current television contract status of the NFL, all four major networks are involved in deals with the NFL right now and that pursuing a deal with any new league would be akin to financial suicide. With the power the NFL wields at this time, itâ€™s unlikely any TV network would want to upset the league by helping a competitor. The NFL didnâ€™t feel obligated to comment on the announcement of the UFL plan to begin play next summer. Why should they? Without a network TV deal, the new league is doomed from the start, which precludes why the NFL should comment.

Buy and sell tickets to premium and sold out events Search by events or regions: Looking to sell tickets quick? All eyes on Woods and Mickelson By Jerry Potter, USA TODAY DUBLIN, Ohio &#8212; There could be no greater dream match for golf fans, the serious and the casual, than seeing going head-to-head at the Memorial Tournament, which begins Thursday at Muirfield Village. Just having the No. 1 and 2 players in the world at any event is interesting, but having them here on ' golf course in Jack's tournament ups the ante. Woods and Mickelson said Wednesday after the Memorial pro-am that they don't necessarily consider their situation a blood feud. But they have had some icy moments, notably when they were paired together in the opening round of the 2004 Ryder Cup. "It's flattering, at least to me anyway," Mickelson said when asked about the public's perception of a rivalry. "But it's probably not flattering to him." Woods' role is more like that of Nicklaus than Palmer because after Nicklaus established himself there was a succession of players, from to Lee Trevino to Johnny Miller to , who challenged for a while but not forever. "I've had different guys make different runs," Woods said. "It was David (Duval) then Phil and Ernie (Els), Vijay (Singh), Goose (Retief Goosen), a combination of those guys through out the years. As long as I'm a part of each of those conversations I'm doing all right." Mickelson, who turns 37 on June 16, says he'd need exceptional success to even catch Woods, who is 31. Mickelson has 31 wins on the PGA Tour, three of them majors, all coming since 2004. Woods has 57 Tour wins, including 12 majors. This year Mickelson won the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and The Players, which ranks next to a major in importance. Woods has three wins. He was second in The Masters and 37th in The Players. Mickelson was 24th in The Masters. Mickelson's victory in The Players, coupled with his switch to noted teacher Butch Harmon, who tutored Woods in some of his best years, has rekindled the thoughts of a renewed rivalry. "It's a tough feat," he said of challenging Woods. "We're talking about probably the best player of all time." Mickelson said he's not even thinking about overtaking Woods in the World Golf Ranking, adding, "It'll certainly be a while before anybody has a realistic chance at taking on Tiger because of the success that he has had." Woods has won the Memorial three times; Mickelson has never won it. "It's no different than any other tournament," Mickelson said. "He's probably won other tournaments more than three." Woods and Mickelson won't be alone &#8212; the 107-player Memorial field includes the top six players in the world and eight of the top 10 &#8212; but they will be certain to boost TV ratings, and a showdown between No. 1 and No. 2 would add to the interest. When asked Tuesday about Woods' dominance, Nicklaus said, "We don't know if anybody can get to that level. Right now, nobody is."

Sports - NHL - Northern exposure Tue, May 29, 2007 QUOTE OF THE DAY Bettman eyes Winnipeg or Quebec City over Southern Ontario Commissioner Gary Bettman was intrigued with idea of the NHL returning to Winnipeg in the future. (AP File/Paul Sakuma) ANAHEIM -- Winnipeg over Waterloo? That certainly appeared to be the inference delivered yesterday by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, who seemed to suggest that the possibility of an NHL franchise returning to Manitoba or Quebec City is more realistic than the addition of another team to the southern Ontario market. In fact, the NHL commissioner seemed to sour on the notion of another team landing in the Toronto area. "It's not something I've given any thought to," Bettman said. "... I frankly think -- and I live in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area -- that it's tough for all the clubs to get media attention, particularly when they're having tough years on the ice. "There's some real downside to having multiple teams in one market." In other words, the commissioner's message seems to be: If Blackberry magnate Jim Balsillie wants to move the Nashville Predators, the NHL would rather they go to Winnipeg than Waterloo, the home of the Research In Motion CEO. Balsillie's recent purchase of the Predators must still be rubber-stamped by three-quarters of the owners. A vote could come next month. Either way, Bettman warned that all the talk regarding a potential franchise relocation of the Preds is premature. "I met with Mr. Balsillie last week and I specifically asked him whether or not he had specific plans or intentions with respect to moving this franchise and he told me that he did not," Bettman said. "So I think there has been entirely too much speculation in terms of what comes next." The previous time an American-based team moved to Canada was when the Atlanta Flames moved to Calgary in 1980. "With respect to a franchise returning to Canada, that's something that intrigues me," the NHL commissioner said. Bettman was asked why he thought it might work in Winnipeg the second time around "The combination of a salary cap and revenue sharing," he said. "Markets that couldn't afford to compete now can be more competitive. Instead of having teams with payrolls of $20 million US and teams with payrolls at $80 million, we now have a $16-million range within which everybody has to be. "We also have revenue sharing. Some teams can get double-digit in revenue sharing in any given year." Bettman was commissioner of the league when the Quebec Nordiques moved to Colorado in 1995-96 and when the Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix a year later. "We haven't studied Quebec City or Winnipeg or anywhere else in Canada, but the notion that if it could work to put a franchise back in a place where one was lost, feels good -- provided we don't wind up in a situation where we've created a prescription for another failing franchise. "So intrigued? It's obviously something I've thought about in terms of trying to make right something that one point in our history went wrong." How has the officiating been in this year's NHL playoffs? OK, but a few missed calls Disastrous, they should all be fired

(Alexander Hassenstein/Bongarts/Getty Images) CHICAGO—Well-known investment banker Bill Hambrecht and Google Inc. executive Tim Armstrong plan to launch a competitor to the National Football League next summer, The New York Times The league—to be named the United Football League—already boasts billionaire Mark Cuban, who owns the National Basketball Association&#39;s Dallas team, among its owners, the paper said. Hambrecht, Google and Cuban were not immediately available to comment. The plan is for eight teams to begin preseason games in August 2008, according to the paper. The UFL would be the latest in a series of leagues to compete with the NFL since the 1970s, including the World Football League, the United States Football League and most recently the XFL—all of which failed. An NFL spokesman declined to comment. David Carter, executive director of the USC Sports Business Institute said the effort should not be dismissed, but it will be an uphill battle to establish the new league. "The NFL is clearly so very powerful that they&#39;ve done a fantastic job of being able to fend off upstart leagues by ensuring that there are never enough open or underserviced markets available to make a start-up league successful," he said. Google V.P. of Advertising Tim Armstrong (Scott Gries/Getty Images) "On the surface, if history tells us anything, it can&#39;t possibly work," Carter added. "But—this is going to sound like Yogi Berra—history was a long time ago and now the landscape has changed. The right people properly capitalized should never be taken for granted." Success for the UFL may not mean long-term existence as a league, but a place for some of its teams as expansion members in the NFL, Carter said. Hambrecht, the founder of WR Hambrecht + Co., and Armstrong have each pledged $2 million, the paper said. The plan is to establish teams in markets where the NFL does not have one, including Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Mexico City, according to the paper. Cuban is considering taking the Las Vegas franchise. Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, reportedly also owns a franchise in the new UFL. (Brian Bahr/Getty Images) Each owner will put up $30 million for an initial half-interest in a team, with the league owning the other half, the paper said. The UFL will eventually sell shares to the public so that the league, owner and fans each own a third of each team. Hambrecht told the paper he believes the initial public offering would raise, on average, another $60 million per team, giving each about $90 million in working capital. He expects any potential owners to be wealthy and able to absorb losses for up to five years, and the new league is open to a smaller television deal with a cable networks such as USA, TNT or Comcast&#39;s Versus, according to the paper. The story said the UFL could easily fall apart and pointed out billionaire hedge fund manager T. Boone Pickens recently abandoned his intention to buy a team. Pickens was not immediately available to comment. Copyright 2000 - 2007 Epoch Times International

New York is poised to become the latest state to ease or eliminate decades-old restrictions on scalping. For the first time, it would become entirely legal in the state for average fans to scalp their seats on the Internet. And, for better or worse, they could sell those tickets at whatever price the market is willing to bear. The state assembly approved the changes Tuesday. The Senate is expected to follow suit, and Governor. Eliot Spitzer could sign the measure by Friday, when the state's old anti-scalping law expires. "If you have something to sell, you should be able to sell it for what it is truly worth," said Sean Pate, spokesman for the online ticket broker StubHub Inc., which lobbied hard for the change. Some old regulations would stay in place. Scalpers would still be banned from selling tickets within 1,500 feet of large arenas, like Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium, and within 500 feet of smaller venues. Large-volume brokers would still need to get a license, too. It's those brokers who have Russ Haven of the New York Public Interest Research Group worried. Haven argues that lifting the price caps will only prompt greedy opportunists to snap up every available seat, and then jack up prices. "I think this is a bum deal for consumers," Haven said. "As it is, seats to popular events are often selling for 10 times their face price...It may be that there will be some portion of tickets that go for less than face value, but that's not what they're all banking on."

Scenes from the NBA conference finals Check the NBA Index First-round views of the action Scenes from the second round Follow all the postseason action Grizzlies hire Suns assistant Iavaroni as head coach By Doug Haller, The Arizona Republic The Suns' offseason maneuvering began Wednesday with an expected transaction: Marc Iavaroni is leaving for greater opportunity. The Memphis Grizzlies have hired the popular Suns assistant as their head coach. Suns coach Mike D'Antoni, reached by phone, didn't find the news surprising. Iavaroni, a 14-year NBA veteran as a player and coach, has been a top coaching candidate for some time. He was strongly considered for past openings in Milwaukee and Portland and was considered the early front-runner in Memphis. "That's the thing," D'Antoni said. "Anyone who's an assistant aspires to be a head coach, and Marc's definitely paid his dues. ... I don't think there's any question (he's ready)." Iavaroni, who was unavailable for comment, spent the past five years with the Suns, the last three and a half as D'Antoni's lead assistant. During his time in Phoenix, he helped develop Suns center Amar&#233; Stoudemire and displayed a passion for defense, especially in the post. He also had a lead role in the team's postseason preparation, filling the locker room whiteboard with as much strategy, instruction and motivation as possible. "I don't think anybody has worked harder or prepared more for this opportunity," Suns assistant coach Phil Weber said. "Last year, Marc was talked about in some situations, but this year there was a lot of momentum behind him. I think it's a great opportunity for him." Iavaroni reportedly has agreed to a three-year deal to help revive the Grizzlies, who finished this past season with the league's worst record. Injuries were a constant headache, and as a result the team missed the playoffs for the first time in four seasons. Memphis is a team in transition. In December, ownership fired Mike Fratello and replaced him with Tony Barone Sr. In April, Jerry West announced he would vacate his post as president of basketball operations once his contract expires July 1. Memphis will pick fourth in the June 28 draft. For now, D'Antoni isn't concerned with filling Iavaroni's spot, adding that no timetable has been set to add a replacement. "We're just happy for Marc," he said. To report corrections and clarifications, contact Reader Editor USA TODAY welcomes your thoughts, stories and information related to this article.

"Tonight we caught a break," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich quickly conceded Wednesday, "and we realize that." It wasn't their first of the postseason, either, as you might have heard. The team from Dallas that Spurs coaches believe was "built to beat us" couldn't get out of the first round. There was a controversial suspension or two, as well as a famously bloody nose, that nudged them along in the second round. Then Wednesday, with Utah's best player forced to pull his sprained right foot out of a protective boot to play this Game 5, San Antonio surged to an effortless 19-point lead in the first quarter and closed the Jazz and a hobbling out with a 109-84 rout. "They destroyed our will to want to play," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. Lucky and really good. It's a lethal combination. You don't win championships without fortune, no matter what. That's probably why Popovich, just as in 2005 when the Spurs clinched their last trip to the NBA Finals, commemorated this victory with almost the same speech he made in Phoenix two years ago about the lottery blessing his franchise. Asked to explain how the Spurs have positioned themselves to play for a third championship in five years and fourth in nine years, Pop said: "That's an easy equation. It is It is a lot more than that, actually, but you know the Spurs. They're so annoying modest, which is yet another reason -- along with the alleged flops, chops and other Uglyball tactics that they use when necessary -- that this team gets tagged with all the Take a closer look, though, and you'll note that the Spurs cracked 100 points on this night for the sixth time in the last two series, reinforcing their growing Play At Any Pace reputation. They have Duncan looking reborn at 31 -- dominating anew largely because he's as healthy as he's been in years -- and flanked by a seasoned (25) and an increasingly spry , who's healthier himself at 29 than he seemed just weeks ago. Mix in the role players who snap together so nicely -- and Ginobili's increasingly effective countryman -- and there's little mystery why San Antonio will be comfortably favored to take down whoever wins the East. "I can't see anybody beating them," Williams said. "I'm not going to say they can't be beat, but they play so well together." Said Sloan: "They have got guys that know what they can accomplish as soon as they step on the floor. They got a lot of great pieces to a great team." "That's a tough question," said Jazz guard , who's a pretty qualified judge after numerous duels with San Antonio in his Laker years. "In terms of versatility and the ability to play different styles, I can see why people would say that. "This team is different [than previous Spurs teams], I can admit that." It has to feel a bit like 2005 all over again for the Spurs . . . and not just because of the potential Detroit rematch looming. The Lakers, as they did in '05 with the re-hiring of Phil Jackson, are smothering the playoffs with their latest off-court dramas. As my old Dallas Morning News colleague David Moore joked, San Antonio bouncing a Utah team that took the Mavs' spot in the West finals -- a team that was never supposed to get this far -- ranks as maybe the fifth-biggest story in the league right now . . . behind all of Kobe Bryant's various Trade Me/Scratch That pronouncements. We'll have to wait a whopping seven days before Game 1 of the Finals -- which can only help San Antonio, in Parker's estimation, because "we've got a lot of old guys" -- to see if these better-than-ever Spurs can win another odd-year championship and move up a spot or two. "If we don't finish in the next round," Ginobili said, "no one will remember what we did against Denver, Phoenix and Utah." Marc Stein is the senior NBA writer for ESPN.com. To e-mail him, Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs celebrates with his fiance/actress Eva Longoria after winning the West. The Beef With Kobe The constant flip-flopping -- not to mention his throwing his current teammates under the bus in such blatant and disrespectful fashion -- has made him look confused, wishy-washy and selfish. I'll give Kobe Bryant the benefit of the doubt by saying he's speaking out of emotion, but many in the public may not be so gracious. I also don't like Kobe sounding as if he's so persecuted. Again, he has a right to be upset after a "Lakers insider" blamed Shaq's departure entirely on him. I believe Kobe -- in part, because of what I've long heard elsewhere -- when he says Jerry Buss decided independently of him to trade Shaq because he didn't want to pay him $80 million. Jerry Buss, Kobe and Shaq all played a role in the demolition of that dynasty, so it's unfair and unfortunate that Kobe's shouldered the blame for three years. But Kobe wasn't the completely innocent, unaware bystander he's saying he was. If he and Shaq hadn't been at such odds, perhaps it would not have come to that. And if he had said, "if you want me back, bring Shaq back so we can continue competing for championships,'' Buss may have worked out a way to keep Shaq. There was definitely a part -- an understandable part -- of Kobe that wanted to see how far he could take a team on his own. Kobe's benchmark is Michael Jordan, and I believe Kobe wanted to see if he could win titles like Jordan did -- without a dominant big man. After winning three rings at such a young age -- not to mention the drama he had with Shaq -- I can understand Kobe wanting to see what it would be like to have his own team. Well, this is what it's like. Complete Chris Broussard blog Not Enjoying Camp Yet Chad Ford was on hand for the first full day of Orlando predraft camp. Here's who didn't fare so well: Dominic James, PG, Marquette 0 points, 0 assists in 20 minutes I think I want to take back all that lobbying I did on behalf of James this week to get him into the camp. He has speed and strength, but he was the only player here to do virtually nothing in the game. If that's not the signal he needs to go back to Marquette, I don't know what is. Daequan Cook, SG, Ohio State 6 points, 8 turnovers, 3-for-10 shooting Cook may have more raw talent than anyone else at the camp, but he's also the youngest player here and it really showed. He had poor shot selection, forced way too many plays and ended up looking very much like a kid who needs to go back to school. I know he says he's staying in the draft, and some team may take him late in the first round based on his upside, but Day 1 was a pretty big disappointment. Dominic McGuire, F, Fresno State 4 points, 2 rebounds I've never understood some of the hype going around about McGuire and he did nothing today to justify it. He struggled to score on Demetris Nichols, a guy not known as a defensive stopper. Whatever his game is, it was difficult to see in this setting. Full Chad Ford column Tim's Recurring Title Quest Duncan in fourth NBA final in nine years T 'n' T: Dynamite Together Tony Parker and Tim Duncan, who each had 21 points in Game 5 win over Utah, talk it over after finishing a game that was one big victory lap. Spurs guard Tony Parker: The outside shot might be less than deadly, but Mr. Lane Havoc has plenty to offer. In the trouncing of the Jazz, 21 points and zero turnovers gave Eva plenty to shoot for. This one was so out of reach, San Antonio fans were doing the wave in the fourth quarter. Jazz center Mehmet Okur: When Rafael Araujo is looking like a better choice in the pivot, by gosh, it's not your day. Or series. Okur, who looked stellar at times against the Rockets and Warriors, had eight points and three rebounds as his team was ushered out the playoff door. Quote of the Day: "We are in the Western Conference finals and we have guys with vacation plans. On the other side of the spectrum, you see a guy like D-Fish who flew across the country to make it back to the game. It is sad to have that. One guy on vacation, some guys having real-life stuff going on and trying to make it back and give everything he has. That's a problem we need to get fixed this summer." Jazz forward Carlos Boozer, asserting that at least one teammate had given up on the season before Game 5 . . . on the same night teammate Derek Fisher managed to make it to the arena by halftime after accompanying his infant daughter to New York for an appointment to treat her rare form of eye cancer. Complete linescore for every player How About Chicago? ... If the Lakers decide to trade him, still holds a no-trade clause that he can selectively enforce, and he would likely insist on a team that would give him an immediate shot at a title. After talking to the NBA executives all of them mentioned (at least) two teams: the Bulls and the Suns. The Bulls are the obvious choice, and a source close to the situation claims that Kobe has been eyeing Chicago for the past month as his preferred destination. To make it happen in a way that gives the Lakers sufficient value in return and keeps the Bulls competitive enough to still play for a title, here's what probably would have to happen: Bryant to Chicago for , and Victor Khryapa. To make this deal work under the cap, the Bulls also would have to re-sign to a one-year deal worth roughly $6.5 million to make the salaries match within 25 percent of each other. So in that sign-and-trade scenario Brown also would have to be included in the offer to the Lakers. If that's not enough to entice the Lakers, the Bulls also could throw in the No. 9 pick in the draft. That probably would be the best deal the Lakers could get. They would fill holes at the 2 and 3, cut several million from the cap and (if a pick's involved) get a top-10 pick in one of the best drafts in a decade. It's a little shakier for the Bulls, because would they give up two key players and replace them with one. Bryant and would be great together in the backcourt. They would still have and could re-sign restricted free agent The complete Chad Ford blog ... Or Maybe Kobe At MSG? Chris Sheridan examines possible Kobe trade destinations/scenarios: Any package presumably would begin with , whose salary is almost an identical match with 's, and then the Knicks would have to include a package of young players ( ) and (presumably) their No. 1 pick in exchange for an additional player the Lakers would want to get rid of ( Bryant has a good relationship with Isiah Thomas, who courted Bryant three summers ago when he was a free agent, and he could probably be sold on the argument that teaming him with a dominant offensive big man, , would make the Knicks immediate championship contenders. More possible Kobe deals is the King what does that make How about the young prince? No, that's right, we have a Prince. Whatever you want to call him he has appeared out of nowhere and made this a series that makes you want to fast forward to the next game. Who would have predicted that a guy who's played in only 60 games and less than a 1,000 minutes this season would have helped turn this series on its head. The previous series against New Jersey gave no indication of things to come either. He only played 11 minutes a game, shot 9-27 from the floor and went to the foul line only two times. All of a sudden he looks like on drives with his attacking style of play. Let's see we have "The Truth" and "The Answer" how about calling Gibson "The Hope?"

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18950440/&cid Fisher, Williams can't save Jazz - Wire Services - NBA - MSNBC.com Fisher, Williams can't save Jazz By By ELIZABETH WHITE SAN ANTONIO (AP) -Another dramatic midgame arrival from Derek Fisher wasn't enough for the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night. With Deron Williams struggling because of a sore foot, it was already too late for the Jazz. By the time Fisher arrived during halftime of Game 5 of Western Conference finals, the Spurs were well on their way to a 109-84 victory that sent them to the NBA finals. Without much help from their starting backcourt, the Jazz never led and trailed by as many as 29. Fisher was returning from New York, where his infant daughter underwent a procedure for a rare eye condition. He was expected to arrive before tip-off, but wasn't on the court or the bench in time. Gordan Giricek started in his place, with Dee Brown prepared to come off the bench. Williams started despite a sprained right foot, but had only seven points in the first half. He finished with just 11, well below his average from the first four games, and was visibly hobbled. Without the team-best 29.5 points Williams was scoring in the series heading into Wednesday's game, the Jazz fell apart. They were outscored 34-15 in the first quarter and trailed 55-39 at the half. Fisher had two points. Andrei Kirilenko led the Jazz with 13 points and Matt Harpring had 11. Carlos Boozer had 12 rebounds for Utah. Fisher's infant daughter, Tatum, is receiving treatment for her left eye. Fisher left the team in the second round of the playoffs for an operation in New York, then returned to the team during the third quarter of Game 2 of a second-round series against Golden State. His dramatic arrival, and his five points in overtime, helped the Jazz win that game. The club announced after Game 4 in Salt Lake City on Monday night that Fisher was leaving the team to be with Tatum during further treatment. Team spokeswoman Cindy Edman said the Fishers had a doctor's appointment Tuesday and a procedure Wednesday morning. Williams hurt his foot in the fourth quarter of Game 4. He received treatment instead of practicing Tuesday, then wore a large walking boot at the shootaround Wednesday morning. The team initially reported the injury as a sprained ankle, but corrected the diagnosis Wednesday. Williams was a game-time decision Monday night, too, but played 38 minutes and scored a team-best 27 points. Â© 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Hewitt finds the will to win Australia's Lleyton Hewitt finds another backhand winner in his stunning comeback against Argentina's Gaston Gaudio. Lleyton Hewitt kept his French Open campaign alive last night with a stunning come-from-behind win over Argentina's Gaston Gaudio. Down two sets to love, the Australian pulled out one of his trademark fightbacks to defeat the 2004 French champion 4-6, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 on centre court. The Australian is now on track to meet claycourt master Rafael Nadal in the fourth round if he can overcome Finland's Jakko Nieminen, seeded 20, who had an easy 6-1, 6-1, 6-4 win against Frenchman Mathieu Montcourt. Hewitt wore down Gaudio over three hours 28 minutes, finding his range in the third set after a slow start. His best result for the French Open was making the quarter-finals in 2001 and 2004. Last year, he made it through to the fourth round. It's been a good start to the French Open for Australians, with Samantha Stosur's liking for a challenge and cool head under pressure securing her a place in the French Open third round for the first time, uncharted territory in which she will encounter Czech No. 6 seed Nicole Vaidisova. Stosur was struggling in the third set of her second-round match against Maria Kirilenko, but came back from a rain delay to immediately convert a crucial break point and calmly complete a 6-1, 3-6, 7-5 victory over the Russian. "This tournament's always been hard for me and I'm just really, really happy to be in the third round for the first time," said Stosur, who is due to meet Vaidisova tonight (Melbourne time). "Hopefully, it won't stop here." Stosur, the No. 27 seed, went into the match having equalled her best performance at Roland Garros by making the second round, which she also achieved in 2005. But she was determined to go at least one better. "It was a very tight match and at the end, I think I got a little bit tired," the Australian said. "I knew she was kind of feeling the same thing, so it was just a matter of being out there and really moving my feet, really just enjoying the challenge. "In the end, I came up with the right shots at the right time and won." Vaidisova has played Stosur three times, all last year, and the 18-year-old world No. 10 from Prague has won every time. But the 30th-ranked Stosur has recent form on clay, having beaten then-top seed Amelie Mauresmo in the second round of the Italian Open last month. And now that she has started to enjoy playing on clay, she doesn't want to stop. "I've played Nicole a handful of times, never actually beaten her, so it will be fun to go out there and play her again," Stosur said. "Third round, I'll just go out there and enjoy it and play the way I play." The first round of these rain-hit championships was finally completed yesterday, producing an unwanted record for American men, none of whom progressed to the second round of a grand slam tournament for the first time since the Open era began in 1968. Robby Ginepri was the last of the nine to bow out, losing from two sets to one up against Argentina's Diego Hartfield. World No. 1 Roger Federer was none too pleased with proceedings, either, slamming officials for scheduling his second-round match to start and finish in murky conditions. Federer, who needs a Roland Garros title to complete the full set of majors, finished his 6-1, 6-2, 7-6 (10-8) win over French wildcard Thierry Ascione just before 9.15pm (Paris time), with Court Suzanne Lenglen almost in darkness. "When we shook hands, I told him I couldn't see him any more, it was so dark," Federer said. "The conditions were shocking. I know they want to get the matches over and done with but what I don't like is that they know I'm the favourite and they think I should win in straight sets. 'Let's get Roger's match over and done with, then he's happy, he has a day off.' But what if it doesn't turn out this way? I would be very upset. I already wasn't happy playing so late." Nor were the locals pleased, with hopes of a first French Open men's singles title since Yannick Noah nearly a quarter-of-a-century ago in tatters. French veterans Sebastien Grosjean, Arnaud Clement and Fabrice Santoro all failed to make it past the first round, to the dismay of the partisan Parisian crowds. And matters got distinctly worse when French No. 1 Richard Gasquet had a nightmare against Belgium's Kristof Vliegen, booed off centre court after losing 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, 6-1. Gael Monfils and doubles expert Michael Llodra gave the crowds something to cheer, while Mauresmo, who is short of practice having missed two months after an appendix operation, defeated American Laura Granville 6-0, 7-5. Second seed Maria Sharapova saw off the challenge of another Frenchwoman, Emilie Loit, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) in one hour 50 minutes. When you see news happening: SMS/MMS: 0406 THE AGE (0406 843 243), or us.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) ANAHEIM, Calif. &mdash; It isn't often the Los Angeles Angels get home runs from their 3-4-5 hitters in the same game. They came at the right time, because Jered Weaver didn't have his best stuff. Vladimir Guerrero hit a go-ahead, three-run shot off Felix Hernandez, Gary Matthews Jr. and Casey Kotchman hit consecutive home runs in the first, and the Angels bullpen preserved an 8-6 win over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night. "It's good, because there are going to be sometimes when we're not going to do well offensively and our pitchers pick us up and keep us in close ballgames," Guerrero said through a translator. "We have a good pitching staff, and hopefully all of us can contribute to them." Guerrero's homer was his first since May 17 at Seattle. It hasn't been easy getting good pitches to hit, because everyone is pitching around the 2004 AL MVP. Guerrero's greatest strength is he is one of the game's best bad-ball hitters. "I can't get frustrated because it's part of the game. I've been saying that for a long time," Guerrero said. "I don't get frustrated because I trust the people that hit behind me. The home runs just happen when they happen. I don't worry about when they come or when they don't come. But I'm very happy that this one came tonight." Dustin Moseley (4-0) got the win in relief of Weaver, who was pulled after 4 2-3 innings with the Angels down 5-4. After Guerrero's homer put Los Angeles ahead 7-5, Moseley pitched two innings and gave up an RBI double to Raul Ibanez that cut the Angels' edge to 7-6 in the sixth. But Scot Shields pitched a perfect eighth and Francisco Rodriguez worked the ninth for his 18th save in 19 chances. Hernandez (3-3) allowed seven runs and nine hits in seven innings. He surrendered his first three homers of the season, as the Angels took the rubber game of the series and extended their lead in the AL West to 5 1/2 games over the second-place Mariners. "We were a little disappointed because we felt we had a chance to win the game with our ace on the mound," Adrian Beltre said. "It didn't happen, but we're going to get a chance to face these guys again, and hopefully we can do better next time. We've got four months left, so one series is not going to make a difference right now." Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak to 23 games _ tying his career best in 2001. The two-time AL batting champion is within one game of the franchise record set by Joey Cora in 1997. Weaver had won his previous three starts, and the Angels gave him a 4-1 lead in the first inning. But the Mariners made it 4-all on Beltre's RBI double in the fifth and Yuniesky Betancourt followed with an RBI single that finished the right-hander. "My command just really wasn't there," Weaver said. "The off-speed stuff felt great, but I was struggling with my fastball command. I just couldn't make my pitches and they put some good swings on the ball." Pinch-hitter Robb Quinlan drove in an insurance run in the Angels seventh with a sacrifice fly that Betancourt caught. The shortstop made an over-the-shoulder catch in short left-center field and couldn't get the ball home fast enough after Reggie Willits tagged up. Guerrero had a chance to break open the game in the eighth, but struck out with the bases loaded against Brandon Morrow. The rookie reliever extended his scoreless streak to 15 2-3 consecutive innings. The Mariners wrapped up a 6-4 road trip that began with a makeup game in Cleveland and continued through Tampa Bay, Kansas City and Anaheim. When they return to Seattle, the journey will have covered 6,273 miles. "It's going to be good to get back home," Beltre said. "We finished the road trip over .500 and we could have done better, but it was a good trip." Notes:@ Angels infielder Erick Aybar started at third base for the first time in his professional career. Normally a second baseman, he made a neat play on the first batter of the game, making a diving stop on Suzuki's grounder in the hole and throwing him out from one knee. ... Angels RHP Bartolo Colon's next scheduled start on Sunday was pushed back to June 8, when the club opens a nine-game road trip at St. Louis. The 2005 AL Cy Young winner, experiencing tightness in his triceps since early this month, has allowed 15 runs in 10 2-3 innings over his last two starts.

(AP) -It isn't often the Los Angeles Angels get home runs from their 3-4-5 hitters in the same game. They came at the right time, because Jered Weaver didn't have his best stuff. Vladimir Guerrero hit a go-ahead, three-run shot off Felix Hernandez, Gary Matthews Jr. and Casey Kotchman hit consecutive home runs in the first, and the Angels bullpen preserved an 8-6 win over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night. ''It's good, because there are going to be sometimes when we're not going to do well offensively and our pitchers pick us up and keep us in close ballgames,'' Guerrero said through a translator. ''We have a good pitching staff, and hopefully all of us can contribute to them.'' Guerrero's homer was his first since May 17 at Seattle. It hasn't been easy getting good pitches to hit, because everyone is pitching around the 2004 AL MVP. Guerrero's greatest strength is he is one of the game's best bad-ball hitters. ''I can't get frustrated because it's part of the game. I've been saying that for a long time,'' Guerrero said. ''I don't get frustrated because I trust the people that hit behind me. The home runs just happen when they happen. I don't worry about when they come or when they don't come. But I'm very happy that this one came tonight.'' Dustin Moseley (4-0) got the win in relief of Weaver, who was pulled after 4 2-3 innings with the Angels down 5-4. After Guerrero's homer put Los Angeles ahead 7-5, Moseley pitched two innings and gave up an RBI double to Raul Ibanez that cut the Angels' edge to 7-6 in the sixth. But Scot Shields pitched a perfect eighth and Francisco Rodriguez worked the ninth for his 18th save in 19 chances. Hernandez (3-3) allowed seven runs and nine hits in seven innings. He surrendered his first three homers of the season, as the Angels took the rubber game of the series and extended their lead in the AL West to 5 1/2 games over the second-place Mariners. ''We were a little disappointed because we felt we had a chance to win the game with our ace on the mound,'' Adrian Beltre said. ''It didn't happen, but we're going to get a chance to face these guys again, and hopefully we can do better next time. We've got four months left, so one series is not going to make a difference right now.'' Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak to 23 games - tying his career best in 2001. The two-time AL batting champion is within one game of the franchise record set by Joey Cora in 1997. Weaver had won his previous three starts, and the Angels gave him a 4-1 lead in the first inning. But the Mariners made it 4-all on Beltre's RBI double in the fifth and Yuniesky Betancourt followed with an RBI single that finished the right-hander. ''My command just really wasn't there,'' Weaver said. ''The off-speed stuff felt great, but I was struggling with my fastball command.

Twins 7, White Sox 6 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -The Twins pieced together another small-ball comeback, leaving Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen a little jealous - and mostly furious. Torii Hunter's four-pitch, bases-loaded walk forced in the winning run with two outs in the ninth inning and sent the surging Twins past the struggling White Sox 7-6 on Wednesday for a three-game sweep. About 19 months after Chicago's World Series title, Guillen was so frustrated by another flat performance that during his latest rant he almost sounded resigned to losing his job. ''I'm going to get fired? Good. Is this team going to get better having me out of there? I'd be too happy with it. But as long as I'm here, we've got to play better. As long as I'm here, we have to play better,'' Guillen said after the fourth straight loss by the White Sox (24-24). Minnesota moved past Chicago into third place in the AL Central, rallying from a 6-1 deficit after 2 1/2 innings against Jon Garland. After beating the White Sox by a combined 19-6 the first two nights, the Twins won for the ninth time in 12 games thanks to a bunch of walks and bouncers - plus excellent defense and plain old good luck. ''They compete as a team. They get you as a team, and that's why they win,'' said Guillen, who alternated between blaming himself and criticizing his players throughout his postgame remarks. Guillen has long been impressed by the Twins, who sped by the slumping White Sox last summer on the way to their fourth division title in the last five years. But he pinned most of the afternoon's performance on the visiting team. ''Offense, defense, pitching, manager, coaches, we all stink,'' Guillen said. Facing Mike MacDougal (1-2) in the ninth, Jason Tyner drew a one-out walk and moved to second when Nick Punto hit a chopper to Paul Konerko for a possible double play. Konerko's throw grazed Tyner before hitting shortstop Alex Cintron in the right knee for an error on the first baseman. ''It was just a bad throw, not really a fluke,'' Konerko said. ''I've made that play a million times.'' Cintron fielded Michael Cuddyer's grounder deep in the hole, but his throw to second was not in time to force Punto. Boone Logan retired Justin Morneau, but David Aardsma was summoned to face Hunter and walked the free-swinging slugger on four pitches to end the game. ''I thought it was pathetic,'' Aardsma said. Hunter, who finished with three RBIs and leads the team with 45, wanted to swing the bat, of course. He lobbied for the green light when the count went to 3-0. ''I saw the ump say, 'You need to come touch first base,' and I was like, 'Oh, OK,''' Hunter said. ''I didn't know what to do. It was weird, man. That was something totally different. But I like it. We won.'' Chicago gave up 47 hits over the previous three games. While Garland allowed just five in six innings, the right-hander walked five and struck out only two. He took that 6-1 lead into the bottom of the third and walked the leadoff batter, Jason Bartlett. Punto and Cuddyer walked, too, loading the bases with one out and bringing a frustrated pitching coach, Don Cooper, out of the dugout. Morneau hit a sacrifice fly, and Hunter followed with a two-run double on the first pitch he saw to cut the lead to two. In the sixth, Garland gave up an RBI groundout to Jeff Cirillo and an run-scoring single to Chris Heintz that tied the game at 6. Heintz's hit took Scott Baker off the hook. After a stellar debut for Minnesota 11 days earlier when he replaced Sidney Ponson in the rotation, Baker has regressed in his last two starts. Some of his breaking balls missed the plate by a few feet and he gave up six runs and 10 hits in only three innings - including Rob Mackowiak's two-run homer. Manager Ron Gardenhire, however, was most disappointed by Baker's failure to cover first base when Morneau made a diving stop of Cintron's grounder in the second. ''Those are things that you can't get away with at this level when you're trying to win ballgames,'' Gardenhire said. The Twins got away with it, though, by doing just about everything else right. Jason Miller, Matt Guerrier, Pat Neshek and Joe Nathan (2-1) teamed up to throw six hitless innings in relief, and Jason Kubel's jumping catch against the left-field wall to take a homer away from Tadahito Iguchi in the top of the ninth highlighted a series of standout defensive plays in the late innings. ''Guys start getting confident, and that's what happens,'' Gardenhire said. Notes: Of Minnesota's 26 runs in this series, 18 came with two outs. ... This was the final game as Minnesota's official scorer for Tom Mee, the first employee hired by the organization when the franchise moved from Washington before the 1961 season. Mee worked in public relations and became official scorer in 1991. Newspaper Home Delivery - Subscribe Today Privacy Policy/Your California Privacy Right Add USATODAY.com RSS feeds

Skip to next paragraph Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times Gov. Eliot Spitzer met publicly with legislative leaders Wednesday for the fourth time, seeking to resolve issues before the session ends June 21. The Democratic-led Assembly passed a bill on Tuesday rolling back scalping restrictions, and the Republican-led Senate is expected to approve the bill later this week. The governor has supported the idea but has stopped short of endorsing the bill, partly to give the Yankees and Mets time to argue their case, people involved in the negotiations said. “Ticket scalping laws historically have not worked,” the governor said at an appearance on Wednesday morning. “I think permitting a free market to work its magic there is the smart approach.” The measure was supported by Broadway theater owners, licensed ticket resellers and some stadium and arena owners, who said they were losing profits to brokers, individuals and Web sites that can resell tickets at far higher prices. Consumer advocates, however, have opposed the bill, saying it would cause prices to skyrocket. The Yankees and Mets have expressed concern that holders of season tickets would resell single tickets without authorization from teams. Assemblyman Joseph D. Morelle, a Rochester Democrat who sponsored the legislation, said the Yankees wanted to be the only ones allowed to resell tickets to their games, a provision aimed at stopping season ticket holders from selling their tickets on Web sites like Mr. Morelle said he rejected the idea of letting the Yankees be the only authorized seller of their tickets because it would have defeated the purpose of the bill. “It would be unfair for us to say that we’re freeing up the secondary market while allowing producers to restrict the primary market,” he said. Officials for the Yankees and Mets did not return calls for comment. On Wednesday, the governor and legislative leaders held their fourth public meeting in four weeks to negotiate a number of issues they want to resolve before the end of the session on June 21. While the tone was more cordial than at previous meetings, the issues remain unresolved, including a proposal to expand DNA collection to all felonies and misdemeanors. One exception appears to be a bill requiring testing of people indicted on rape or sexual assault charges. Assembly Speaker said Wednesday that he would allow the bill to come to the Assembly floor before the end of the session. That greatly improves the chance that it will become law. It is supported by the governor and the Republican-led Senate and has a majority of Assembly members as co-sponsors. Currently, a conviction is required to compel an H.I.V. test. The measure has been sharply contested by some Assembly Democrats who are concerned about the civil liberties ramifications of testing suspects prior to conviction. Others believe that rape victims could get a false sense of security if suspects in their attacks test negative for H.I.V. Assemblywoman Nettie Mayersohn, a Queens Democrat and the chief sponsor of the bill in the Assembly, said victims and their doctors should be the ones to decide. “This is a decision that should be made by the woman and not by the legislators in Albany,” she said in a recent interview. The governor also vetoed three bills on Wednesday, including one that would have required contractors to post the prevailing wage rates. Mr. Spitzer argued that contractors who obey the law would be subject to unnecessary paperwork while those who do not pay the prevailing wage now would probably simply ignore the new requirement. The ticket scalping bill would allow tickets to be resold for whatever amount the market would bear. The bill also includes protections against consumer fraud. Under the existing anti-scalping law, which expires in June, licensed ticket resellers may charge up to 45 percent above the face value of tickets for events at large arenas. That law makes an exception for venues with fewer than 6,000 seats, including most Broadway theaters, limiting resale of their tickets to no more than 20 percent, or $5 over face value, whichever is greater. Until recently, that exception was supported by the League of American Theaters and Producers , a Broadway trade organization, whose members felt that an unfettered market would cause prices to go beyond the reach of all but the wealthy. But last fall, the league quietly reversed its position, arguing to a state consumer protection board that prices would not skyrocket if the ban was lifted and that the rise of sites on the Internet had already made it impossible to enforce. Steve A. Malito, a spokesman for a trade organization of licensed brokers that had lobbied to lift the ban for years, said the theater league’s change of heart had been pivotal. “It would appear that they now agree that this ultimately benefits the consumers,” Mr. Malito said. “We’re thrilled that they’ve switched their positions.” Consumer advocates said they thought the league had other motives. “Clearly, they think they can benefit financially with the repeal of anti-scalping law,” said Russ Haven, the legislative counsel for the New York Public Interest Research Group , which has opposed the repeal. Broadway has toyed in recent years with different ways to prevent losing ticket sales to brokers, such as reserving a portion of tickets to every performance and selling them at the box office as “premium tickets.” (The top ticket price to “Jersey Boys” is $121.50; a premium ticket costs $351.50.) By eliminating the caps on ticket resales, Mr. Haven said, the Broadway lobby had signaled that it could no longer beat ticket brokers and scalpers and was joining them. To crack down on street scalpers, the new law does ban the resale of tickets within 500 feet of any venue with 5,000 or fewer seats and within 1,500 feet of larger venues. However, it would allow theaters to open their own resale offices within that zone. In a statement, Charlotte St. Martin, the league’s executive director, praised the anti-fraud provisions in the bill and “the new buffer zone in the theater district that will prevent illegal ticket scalping in front of Broadway theaters.” Campbell Robertson contributed reporting from New York City.

Pujols, Cards pound Rockies Albert Pujols speaks with FSN Midwest after his two hits and three RBI helped the Cardinals snap the Rockies' seven-game win streak. But now that he's gotten a taste of starting, life won't be the same for him. "I'm liking starting," Wellemeyer said. Wellemeyer earned a victory in his first major league start, hit consecutive homers in the fifth, and St. Louis beat Colorado 8-4 Wednesday night to end the ' seven-game winning streak. Wellemeyer can now be added to the list of relievers the have successfully converted into starters this season. St. Louis has turned into winning starters in 2007. Wellemeyer had 119 career relief appearances before his first start. "That was impressive as well as the are playing," manager Tony La Russa said. Wellemeyer knows he has things to work on - like a windup. Wellemeyer (1-0) worked out of the stretch from the first pitch. The 28-year-old righty, claimed off waivers by St. Louis on May 15, lasted five innings, giving up seven hits and three runs. "It's been almost two years (since I threw from the windup)," he said. "I'm going to start throwing it on the side." Wellemeyer also had his second career hit, an RBI single in the fifth. "I'm loving hitting," he said. "I'm liking some more at-bats." The heart of the ' lineup - Pujols, Edmonds and - broke out in a big way. The trio went a combined 7-for-14 with two homers, two doubles, a triple and six RBIs. "When those three guys hit, we have a chance to score a lot of runs," La Russa said. hit back-to-back homers for the first time this season. Pujols drove a three-run homer off to left-center field - his ninth of the season - and Edmonds hit the next pitch to right for his fifth. The tied a season high with five runs in the fifth inning. "They have a good offense," said , who had three hits, including his 10th homer of the season. "Albert, Scott and Jim - those guys have been great for a long time. Those kinds of things are going to happen. You just keep playing." Rolen finished with two RBI doubles and Edmonds was 3-for-5 with a triple and single and two runs scored. The win ended St. Louis' seven-game road losing streak. were attempting to win eight in a row for the first time since Aug. 26-Sept. 2, 1997. But they're not dwelling on the streak that was halted. "We need to try to keep playing good baseball," said Holliday, who leads the majors in three-hit games with 10. hit a solo homer to right in the second inning. Hawpe has hit three homers in as many nights and has eight this season. He also drove a pitch from deep to right with two on in the eighth, but caught it with his back to the wall. Johnson gave up a homer to Hawpe the night before. La Russa said he didn't bring in Johnson for a rematch. "I think (Hawpe) has struggled with lefties and Tyler gets lefties out," La Russa explained. Hirsh (2-5) was pulled after 4 2-3 innings and giving up eight runs. He allowed a career-high 10 hits. "I didn't have my good stuff," Hirsh said. "I couldn't find my command for anything." While the heart of the St. Louis order may have broken out Wednesday night, Edmonds said it's going to take a lot more games like this to pronounce them back. "We haven't swung the bats well this year," Edmonds said. "So we've gotten off to a slow start, and we've got a lot of making up to do." found out Wednesday that catcher will be sidelined four to six weeks with a fractured left wrist.

Pedro Feliz drove in three runs and Rich Aurilia tied a career high with four hits for the Giants, who bounced back from a difficult loss in the series opener against New York. The Mets won 5-4 in 12 innings Tuesday night when Armando Benitez balked in the tying run and surrendered a game-ending homer to Carlos Delgado. Paul Lo Duca had two hits for New York, which had won four straight. Glavine went seven innings but was denied in his second attempt at career win No. 296. Lo Duca led off the seventh with a double for his 1,000th career hit but Zito retired the next three batters, striking out pinch-hitter Julio Franco to end the inning. Zito (5-5) turned in his second consecutive strong outing after struggling in back-to-back starts earlier this month. He gave up 13 runs and 12 hits in 10 innings in outings at Colorado and Oakland, then allowed one run in seven innings in a win over Houston in his last start. He struck out a season-high seven against the Mets, holding them to six hits and one walk. Jack Taschner tossed a perfect eighth and Brad Hennessey got three outs for his second save. Barry Bonds returned to the lineup for the Giants, went 1-for-3 with a walk and remains 10 shy of breaking Hank Aaron's career record of 755 homers. He was booed lustily each time he came to the plate. Bonds entered with a .329 batting average and four homers in 100 career plate appearances against Glavine, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He hit a two-out single to center against him in the first inning to put runners on first and second. After Bengie Molina walked, Feliz grounded a two-run single into left field. Bonds bounced into a double play in the third before Molina singled to right to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. Feliz then tripled off the wall in right-center to make it 3-0. Glavine (5-3) intentionally walked Bonds in the fifth and got him to groundout to first to end the seventh on his 122nd and final pitch of the game. He allowed nine hits, walked two and struck out four. Mets reliever Guillermo Mota was activated after serving the 50th and final day of his suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance. He relieved Glavine to start the eighth and received a mixed reaction of boos and cheers from the home crowd.

Shea fans have rude reception for Barry Bonds but later let returning Guillermo Mota off easy. Read Adam Rubin's Surfing the Mets Blog Read fan blog Subway Squawkers With Barry Bonds making his first Shea start of the season, convicted performance-enhancer Guillermo Mota joining the Mets after a 50-game suspension and Tom Glavine seeking win No. 296, new Giant Barry Zito seemed destined for undercard status last night. But after dozens of looping curveballs and changeups that "never seemed to get there," according to David Wright, Zito wasn't playing second banana to anyone. Backed by three early runs - all driven in by Pedro Feliz and all scored with two out - the lefthander threw seven scoreless innings, dooming the Mets to their first shutout loss of the season, 3-0, in front of 41,395. Glavine, who allowed three runs and nine hits in seven innings, deserved a better fate, a theme that is getting all too familiar - and frustrating - to the 41-year-old who is 5-3 with a 3.44 ERA. "I don't really feel like I've pitched a bad game all year," said Glavine, who has thrown at least six innings in 11 of his 12 starts. "If you told me I had a 12-game stretch coming like this, I'd take my chances that I'd have a better record than I do. "You hope it evens out." For that to happen, the Mets will have to be more productive than last night, when they had only six hits and went 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position. "We couldn't hit at all against Zito," said Carlos Beltran, who doubled in the first but was stranded. "Everything was working for him. They scored a few runs early and we couldn't get back. You can't sit on one pitch. If he feels like throwing five curveballs in a row, he can." Zito (5-5) allowed all six hits and walked one. He struck out seven, five of them looking at his big curve, which was generally clocked around 72 mph. The Mets, vulnerable last season to lefty starters, looked that way again last night, but their record this season against southpaw starters is still a robust 11-4. Zito owns two of the four wins against the Mets. While Bonds and Zito were both booed last night, Mota got a mixed reaction when he came in to start the eighth. There was another bullpen drama - the Giants used righty Brad Hennessey to close the game instead of ex-Met Armando Benitez, who balked twice and gave up a walk-off homer to Carlos Delgado in blowing Tuesday's game. The Giants scored twice in the first, but Glavine believed he was making effective pitches. "Chopper off the plate, a semi-line drive to center and a grounder in the hole. There's not a lot I can do," Glavine said. "It's one of the single most frustrating things you deal with as a pitcher. You keep making pitches, sooner or later things will get better." Sandwiched into that sequence, Glavine walked Bengie Molina on a 3-2 pitch. Feliz followed with a two-run single that snuck under Jose Reyes' glove. In the third, the Mets turned a 3-5-3 double play because Wright had moved near second base in a shift against Bonds that made Wright the only infielder on the left side of second. Bonds hit a grounder to Delgado, who started the DP. But the Giants scored a run on Feliz's triple. Glavine stuck around to throw 122 pitches, the same total as Zito, and a whopping number in this era of pitch counts. But he was working on an extra day's rest and will have another extra day before his next turn. While Glavine said he wouldn't have gone out for the seventh without those cushions, he also admitted that he wanted to stay in because he believed the Mets would score.

World number two Nadal, attempting to become the first man to win three successive titles at Roland Garros since Bjorn Borg in 1980, was in control straight away, opening up a 3-0 lead in the first set. Leading 5-1, the Spaniard was then broken but he underlined his determination by capturing Cipolla's serve immediately to take the set in 34 minutes The second set was even more one-sided, Nadal going 3-1 up, breaking Cipolla again in the sixth game before serving for the set, which he took courtesy of an astute dropshot. The 20-year-old Nadal, whose 81-match streak on clay was ended by Roger Federer in the Hamburg final earlier this month, slowed down a bit after an early break but did enough to stay in control until he earned three match points. A super cross-court forehand winner on the first ended world number 227 Cipolla's suffering in a one-sided contest that laster under two hours. Powerful left-hander Nadal, favored to challenge world number one Federer in the June 10 final, will next meet fellow Spaniard Albert Montanes or Latvia's Ernests Gulbis. Lleyton Hewitt staged a typical fightback from two sets down to beat former champion Gaston Gaudio of Argentina to advance to the third round. The Australian 14th seed looked headed for an early exit but found the inspiration to recover for a 4-6 3-6 6-2 6-4 6-2 win and a last 32 meeting with 20th-ranked Finn Jarkko Nieminen. It was the fourth time in his nine-year professional career that former world number one Hewitt had recovered from a two-sets deficit as he shoved Gaudio to his earliest exit from Roland Garros since 2001. Gaudio, who beat compatriot Guillermo Coria in the 2004 final, has endured a frustrating season but showed his prowess on clay by outsmarting Hewitt in the early stages of the match. He took the first set in 62 minutes with Hewitt unable to convert any of his four break points and followed up with the second as he closed on victory. But Hewitt is a redoubtable battler and by cutting back unforced errors he took the third with breaks in the third and seventh games. With the bit between his teeth, Hewitt leveled affairs after nearly three hours on court and there was only one winner thereafter as Gaudio's confidence waned. Hewitt broke in the first and fifth games of the decider and took the match with a love service game when Gaudio hit a lazy, tired forehand long. Hewitt is headed for a fourth round clash with defending champion Rafael Nadal, a repeat of 2006, while earlier Serbian sixth seed Novak Djokovic, tipped as an outsider for the title, needed four sets to get past French world number 306 Laurent Recouderc. Former Australian Open runner-up Marcos Baghdatis, the 16th seeded Cypriot, also made the third round with a straight sets triumph over Denmark's Kristian Pless.

By RUSTY MILLER AP Sports Writer &copy; 2007 The Associated Press DUBLIN, Ohio &mdash; Masters champion Zach Johnson is here. So are eight of the top 10 players in the world. Yet all anyone seems to notice is the looming duel between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. Both were peppered with questions about a potential showdown in this week's Memorial Tournament. Woods is No. 1 on the planet by acclaim, not even close. But that doesn't stop everybody from trying to speculate about who could sneak up and steal his crown. "I've had different guys make different runs," Woods said after Wednesday's pro-am at Muirfield Village Golf Club. "It was (David) Duval and then probably Phil and Ernie (Els), Vijay (Singh), Goose (Retief Goosen) &mdash; a combination of those guys throughout the years." With Mickelson coming off a big win at The Players Championship three weeks ago, some are saying he may be primed to challenge Woods at the Memorial and then in two weeks at the U.S. Open at Oakmont. Mickelson isn't so sure. "It's flattering &mdash; to me, anyway," he joked of the comparisons between him and Woods. "Probably not to him, but it's flattering to me." It seems that every time Mickelson gets a big win &mdash; the Masters in 2004, the PGA Championship in 2005, the Masters again in 2006 &mdash; it gets Woods' attention. A year ago, for instance, Mickelson won at Augusta and was in position to take his second major in a row before hitting that hideous drive on the final hole that cost him the Open at Winged Foot. Still grieving the loss of his father, Woods wasn't a factor there, but then turned around and won the last two majors, the British Open and PGA. With Woods facing impending fatherhood and the changes that can bring, now could be the time for Mickelson to finally challenge for the top spot in the world. Woods doesn't seem to be conceding anything, though. "As long as I'm up there in the conversation, I'm doing all right," Woods said. "I keep pushing myself pretty hard, regardless. I always try and get better. You can't stay stagnant in any sport. You've always got to keep getting better because you know the guys are training harder, they're finding their game, they're in the gym, you're getting better athletes playing the game. So you've got to keep getting better." Mickelson, leading the tour in putting average, knows how difficult the task is. "It's a tough feat. I mean, we're talking about probably the best player of all time," he said. Memorial Tournament founder Jack Nicklaus was asked if anyone is capable of pressing Woods. "All I know is that Tiger is dominating what's going on. And when he plays and when he's playing well, he is really difficult to beat," Nicklaus said. "We can say that the guys today can't finish and Tiger is the only guy that can play, or we can say that the guys today are really, really good and Tiger is just way above them. We never will have an answer for that." Either way, Mickelson is not giving up. He's lost weight, is halfway through restructuring his swing and is optimistic heading into the Memorial &mdash; a tournament Woods has won three times. Mickelson has never finished in the top three. "A lot of great players have won this tournament. I have not," he said. "It's one of the tour events that I would very much like to win." The field mirrors that of a major. Nine of the top 10 money-winners are on hand, along with former Memorial winners Els, Jim Furyk, Singh, Tom Lehman and Paul Azinger. Johnson, still on a victory lap after winning the Masters in April and the AT&T Classic two weeks ago, burns to remain in such elite company. "This is one of my favorite places to be," said Johnson, who tied for second at the Memorial a year ago, two shots behind winner Carl Pettersson. "Golfwise, I absolutely love it. If you find a complaint here, it's hard." Sorenstam's back - literally this time Is Mickelson ready to challenge Woods?

See the Bulls in action! Kobe Bryant is being traded to the Bulls. No, wait, Kobe Bryant is not being traded to the Bulls. being traded to the Bulls. No, he's not being traded to the Bulls. That's the big problem with this story. By the time you're reading this, Bryant could have asked to be traded or not traded from the Lakers six more times. This is what I know for sure: Kobe Bryant is not being traded this summer, not to anyone, no matter what he says. The Lakers will trade for someone. My guess is Jermaine O'Neal, but if that doesn't happen, or if it does and it doesn't work out, it's not inconceivable Bryant could be with the Bulls in 2008-09. On a personal level, I have to thank Bryant because this allows me to pay less attention to the miserable Eastern Conference finals going on in Detroit and Cleveland. That's the reason, I think, Bryant had a basketball breakdown this week. He has been watching someone named "Booby" Gibson become a hero for the Cavaliers and Utah's Deron Williams skip the five-year waiting period for induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame and Derek Fisher, his old teammate who couldn't break down a man with a cane off the dribble, and some guy on the Spurs with a name and looks like Fabio being celebrated and he's at his window screaming, " I'm home because I'm playing with Smush Parker and Kwame Brown. Aaaggghhh!!!" This is why we really love these guys and this game. To recap, Bryant's breakdown began last week when a Los Angeles Times reporter called to ask how things were going, and Bryant reiterated his position that he's unhappy with the team and wants the Lakers to make some big moves this summer. Given that Los Angeles doesn't have an NFL team and it still doesn't know what to make of baseball and Jack Nicholson doesn't go to those games anyway, the Times basically devoted a special section to the story. So then an ESPN reporter called, and now Bryant was into it. He offered a less-than-supportive vote of confidence for general manager Mitch Kupchak and said he wanted former general manager Jerry West back to run the team because, geez, Kupchak got us Smush Parker and Kwame Brown. West is retiring from the Memphis Grizzlies next month and didn't help matters by saying he always had been a Laker. Ooops. West, who handpicked Kupchak as his successor, quickly said he's not going anywhere. Then Bryant did his first crossover and said he was merely trying to help. "I would love for [West] to be a part of this," Bryant said. "But it's not something where I demand he comes here. All I can do is offer my thoughts. I love being a Laker. I want to retire a Laker. I want to fix this, or at least help any way I can. "I haven't demanded a trade, I haven't asked for a trade, I haven't said anything like that. That's not something I even want to think about." Then there was an anonymous quote in the Times on Tuesday that Bryant was responsible for forcing the trade of Shaquille O'Neal. Angered by that, Bryant went on local radio in Los Angeles to denounce the Lakers, saying the front office was a mess and it had misled him about plans to refurbish the team. Wednesday morning, still simmering, Bryant bubbled over and upped the volume on ESPN radio by saying he wanted to be traded, knocking Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton out of the headlines for a few hours.Reports had his agent informing the Lakers there was nothing they could do to change his mind and he had begun contacting teams, including the Bulls. A few hours later, after a conversation with Phil Jackson and undoubtedly a meditation session and some chanting, Bryant was quoted by the Los Angeles Daily News as saying: "I can only hope they do something, because I don't want to go anyplace else. I want to stay here. Phil said, `Let us try to work that out, figure things out.' That made me feel a lot better. Phil is a guy I leaned on all season for clarity and hope. When Phil and I talked, it was an emotional conversation. I want to stay here. This is my team. I love it here." Copyright & terms of service
http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/14-0&fd=R&url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/31/AR2007053100038.html&cid=1116754239&ei=m-xeRubsBY2G0gGY99jYDQ Small Ball Leads To O's Big Sweep - washingtonpost.com Find Bars & Clubs View a Sample and Sign Up House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Small Ball Leads To O's Big Sweep Orioles 3, Royals 0 Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, May 31, 2007; Page E08 KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 30 -- Corey Patterson showed the Kansas City Royals that he was bunting on the first pitch, but that didn't matter. They knew anyway. "Everybody knew I was doing it, in the whole park," Patterson said. Erik Bedard and Gil Meche had allowed only zeros for seven innings, making it clear this game would not be won by mashing the ball. The extra rest of a 1 hour, 36 minute rain delay does Erik Bedard some good as he pitches eight innings for the first time this season. (Charlie Riedel - AP) Erik Bedard goes eight innings as Baltimore gets its first of the season with a 3-0 win over the Royals to complete a road sweep. Brian Burres has been 'sneaky' in his success. The Orioles' brass must break its decade-old habit of blaming a manager for losses and hold its players accountable. Box score: Orioles 3, Royals 0 | Enhancing a Legacy Save & Share Article So third baseman Esteban German was creeping, then charging down the line, but that didn't matter either. Not the way Patterson runs, and not the way he bunted in the eighth inning, a play that set up Jay Payton's game-winning RBI single and, after a two-run insurance homer by Nick Markakis in the ninth, a 3-0 victory for the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday night. It took a while (rain delayed the start of the game 1 hour 36 minutes) and placed some undue stress on Bedard, who pitched a season-high eight innings, allowed four hits and won for the first time since April 18. "That's a long time ago," he said. After it all happened, though, the Orioles completed a sweep of the Royals and moved to one game under .500 at 26-27 -- their best record since May 11 -- having won five straight. Despite the late-game offensive heroics, Bedard was the star. He has experienced frustration adjusting to the life of an ace, having to face the league's best pitchers every start. His teammates knew of his winning drought, and they wanted to get him a win. In the end, really, he got it himself. "He sucked it up for us real good," Manager Sam Perlozzo said. "I'm sure the lack of wins is probably on his mind a little bit." Payton won the game when he sharply grounded a low slider to the left side. The pitch may have been out of the strike zone, Payton said, and he got out in front of it. But he smacked it hard enough so it skidded through the infield, just under Tony PeÃ±a Jr.'s glove. Pinch runner Freddie Bynum jogged home from third with the game's first run. "He's just a competitor," Perlozzo said. "He bears down and likes being the guy." But first, Patterson's speed allowed it to happen. He dug in against Meche in the eighth, after Ramon Hernandez walked and Bynum replaced him. Patterson took the first pitch after squaring, then nudged the second toward German. German charged almost as Meche wound up. Patterson flew out of the batter's box before the ball even landed and sprinted to first. It was a routine sacrifice bunt, but it wasn't, not how Patterson runs. German pounced on the ball and rifled it to first. Patterson beat the throw without question. Rather than the expected result, a man on second with one out, the Orioles had two men on with no out. The difference allowed Brian Roberts to lay down another bunt, this one less harrowing for Kansas City, but just as effective for the Orioles. Payton followed with his game-winner. "I love playing the game," Payton said. "That's what it's all about, trying to win." The Orioles hadn't given Bedard much, but it was enough. He pitched his best game this season, going deeper than he had before and striking out five, including his last batter. After that, he pumped his fist, a rare show of emotion. "No runs, eight innings," Bedard said. "I was happy." "I know Erik a little bit better," Perlozzo said. "I'm around him a lot. He's a lot more competitive than you think." After Bedard plowed through each inning, he had to sit in the dugout and watch Baltimore's hitters flail, which was nothing new for him. In his previous seven starts, the Orioles had scored 11 runs while he was in the game, which comes to 2.2 runs per nine innings. Bedard won none of those despite a combined 3.43 ERA. It seemed like it might happen again, as Bedard matched Meche inning for inning. He was matched up with another team's best pitcher. Late into Wednesday night, there was none better than Bedard.

Columnist Grant Boone explores the idea that Tiger Woods could create his own golf circuit, and what that would mean to the PGA TOUR and to golf fans everywhere. A Tiger Woods golf circuit could generate great ratings and still allow Woods his chase of history.

I have conflicting thoughts when I think of conflicts. I&#39;m anti-war but pro-soldier. I&#39;m pro-U.S. but not anti-everyone else. I could probably be persuaded into believing there have been times and places in which war was either justified or inevitable. I get the idea that there are truly evil people on the planet who, unchecked, will wreak havoc on innocent lives. Generally speaking, though, I think war is usually waged by individuals or groups with something significant to gain. As for what&#39;s presently going on in Iraq, I think we can all agree -- however much you like (me, on some days) or dislike (me, on others) George W. Bush -- that we haven&#39;t seen an exit strategy this poorly conceived or executed since Jean V.D. Velde at the 1999 British Open. Still, that doesn&#39;t negate the sacrifices made by the U.S. military. And the idea that someone would risk his or her life to allow me the freedom to sit here and take the occasional potshot at The First Consonant is mind-boggling. There is scarcely a greater notion concocted by humankind than that of a person laying down his or her life for another. To all of you who&#39;ve served in America&#39;s armed forces, I thank you. Second, I couldn&#39;t help but think of professional golf as I watched the Indianapolis 500, what there was of it, for a couple of reasons. One, reducing what&#39;s supposed to be the crown jewel of your sport to by 34 laps is tantamount to abdicating your throne. Imagine the USGA shortening the U.S. Open to a 54-hole event. You&#39;d sooner see David Fay in a necktie. Officials at the Indy 500, on the other hand, called the race early but still bequeathed their wreath and jug to the putative winner, Dario Franchitti. They should&#39;ve given him skim milk. It&#39;s yet another example of how one of America&#39;s great sporting events is stuck in the pits. While the weather struck a blow against the race this year, the damage sustained 11 years ago was purely self-inflicted and is the other reason I thought about golf as I watched the fits and starts in Indy. The Indianapolis 500 was once the pace car of what was then the CART series, far and away the most important of the 15 or so annual races. The field each year was filled with the best drivers of that league. CART racing at the time was a fringe sport, for sure, but its stars were utterly mainstream and their names still resonate: Foyt, Andretti, Unser. In 1996, Tony George, owner of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, brought out a monkey wrench. He not only created a rival circuit, the Indy Racing League, he went one worse and reserved most of the spots on the Indy 500 grid for drivers in his new alliance. It splintered the sport and watered down one of America&#39;s great sporting events. Case in point: the winner of the first 500 after the split was Buddy Lazier. Not exactly a name to go alongside the aforementioned appellations in the pantheon of racing heroes. It&#39;s pronounced "luh ZEER," though it&#39;s true the general sports fan has been lazier in following open wheel racing in the U.S. ever since. I thought about all of this in relation to my own conjecture of a Tiger Tour. I&#39;ve wondered, along with others, what would happen if Tiger Woods -- fully aware of the staggering disparity in television ratings between events he plays and those he doesn&#39;t -- decided to renounce his PGA Tour membership and create his own series of tournaments. He could stage whatever number he preferred -- maybe 10 to 12 -- with small, elite fields and find his own tournament sponsors and broadcast partners. CBS, NBC, and Golf Channel are already shelling out a billion dollars for PGA Tour rights even though they know Woods won&#39;t play in two-thirds of the tournaments each season. The 12-14 he does play make it worth it to them. How much would ESPN/ABC pony up for a dozen Tiger Tour events with a guarantee of Woods&#39; presence in each? Here&#39;s where this idea is disturbingly different from what happened with CART and the Indy Racing League: Tiger would still compete in each of the four major championships because none of them are run by the PGA Tour. If, for example, Augusta National decided to start its own tour and insist that golfers play those events to earn a spot in the Masters, that tournament would eventually become irrelevant if the field didn&#39;t include Woods and the other best players of the day. That&#39;s essentially what Tony George did when he made the Indy 500 a closed shop. But Tiger could have the best of both worlds: his own tour and the opportunity to continue his pursuit of the one record he cares about most, Nicklaus&#39; 18 majors. Remember, Woods can play the Masters, British Open, and PGA Championship every year as a past champion. The U.S. Open gives its winners a 10-year exemption, meaning Woods is in that field through at least 2012. That would give him six more years to win another Open and extend his free pass. Even if he didn&#39;t win another one by then, I have a hunch he could snag one of those USGA special exemptions. In creating a rival league, Woods would obviously surrender his PGA Tour membership. And even if the Tour blackballed him from The Players or World Golf Championships by rearranging the eligibility criteria, he&#39;d still have a full season playing his own tour, the four majors, and whatever Tour events he wanted on sponsors&#39; invitations. (My guess is that Woods could finagle an exemption or two from Buick.) There would be significant obstacles, not the least of which might be Tiger even considering the possibility and his chief rivals, et al, being willing to leave the PGA Tour, too. The irony, though, is that the outcome -- at least in the short run -- could actually have the opposite effect of what happened with CART and the IRL. You&#39;re telling me golf fans wouldn&#39;t watch Tiger, Phil, Ernie, Vijay, Boo (just seeing if you&#39;re still with me), and 50 other solid players duke it out for $5 million purses on classic courses like Pinehurst, Pebble, and Winged Foot? (They might have a tough time booking the TPC Sawgrass, but I bet they could get a deal on the courses currently being concocted by the good folks at Tiger Woods Design.) Of course we&#39;d watch. And we&#39;d still get Tiger and all of those players going at it in the tournaments that matter most to us and them, the majors. I&#39;m not suggesting any of this is going to happen. What I am saying is that it could happen, which is why PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem walks such a fine line. He needs to come off as his own man while at the same time making sure Woods is happy. Which might explain the FedEx Cup. For all the talk about the $10 million first prize, the most notable characteristic is the shortened season, which Woods has wanted for years. That fine line might also explain why the Tour stiffed its rank-and-file by making sure the new event in Washington, D.C., which is being hosted by Tiger and which benefits Woods&#39; eponymous foundation, has the limited field Tiger wanted. It will be interesting to see if that event, titled the AT&T National, proves to placate Woods or give him a taste of what the Tiger Tour might one day be. All of this must surely raise a flag at PGA Tour headquarters, if not red then at least a yellow for caution. Because in golf right now, just as it was for American open wheel racing a decade ago, it would appear that one man is in the driver&#39;s seat.

Hambrecht + Company has since become so threatening to traditional underwriters that they often refuse to be involved in any I.P.O. in which his firm takes part. Skip to next paragraph Illustration by David Johnson The New York Times Go to Complete Coverage » And now, at an age when most people are well into retirement, he has decided to tackle the establishment again. This time, though, the establishment isn’t Wall Street. It’s the National Football League. Bill Hambrecht, you see, is starting up a professional football league. So far, he and his partner, Tim Armstrong, a senior executive at Google, have pledged $2 million each. They’ve hired a C.E.O. and a C.O.O., both of whom cut their teeth at the National Basketball Association. They’ve got a name: the United Football League. And they’ve lined up a wealthy, well-known businessman as their first owner: , the billionaire who owns the N.B.A.’s . Like Hambrecht, Cuban loves nothing more than confronting the status quo. Obviously, the U.F.L. is still in the early planning stages. It hasn’t yet hired a single football person and is still hunting for seven more owners with Cuban’s deep pockets and contrarian mindset, so that the league can begin with eight teams. It could easily fall apart before the first kickoff. Indeed, there has already been one setback: Boone Pickens, the oilman turned-corporate-raider-turned-billionaire-hedge-fund manager, recently abandoned his intention to buy a team. But Cuban remains committed, and if all goes according to plan, the U.F.L. will play its first preseason games in August 2008. I kid you not. Hambrecht has been thinking unconventional thoughts about pro football for a long time. Back in the early 1980s, he was a minority partner in the Oakland Invaders, one of the original franchises of the late, unlamented United States Football League, a spring league that played its games during the N.F.L.’s off-season. The U.S.F.L. folded in 1985, after three seasons. “It was started by a bunch of guys who were riding high because of the S.&L. boom,” Hambrecht recalls. “As soon as the boom turned to bust, the league went broke.” Most of us would go through such an experience and conclude, Never again. Not Hambrecht. He was convinced that the U.S.F.L. could have worked with a smarter game plan and owners who were more patient. At various times he discussed a new league with NBC, CBS and Fox, but those talks went nowhere. Then one day last year, Hambrecht told Tim Armstrong, whom he met when his firm helped manage Google’s initial public offering, about his dream of a new football league. The more Armstrong heard, the more excited he got. By October, the two men had committed their $2 million, hired their first three executives (Bill Daugherty, the C.E.O.; Jon Brod, the C.O.O.; and Andrew Goldberg, a senior analyst) and begun an extensive study to see if the idea was really feasible. Let’s now take a moment to consider what the U.F.L. will be up against: a monopolistic sports league utterly unafraid to take advantage of its monopoly power. Over the years, the N.F.L. has squashed four competitors, most recently the NBC- and World Wrestling Federation-backed XFL in 2001. Right now, Arena Football is an alternate league, but it’s a marginal thing, with negligible TV ratings and an average of 12,000 fans per game. And with eight players to a side, games in the N.F.L.’s off-season and a field that looks like a hockey rink, it’s not exactly “real” football. Where others might be daunted by the N.F.L.’s success and power, though, Hambrecht came to believe its monopoly status gave him an opening. “I really started thinking hard about this after the Los Angeles Rams left to go to St. Louis and the Houston Oilers went to Nashville,” he told me over drinks recently. “Why do you leave two of the top 10 TV markets in the country for these two smaller markets?” The answer, of course, is that the N.F.L. doesn’t really have to worry about where its teams are located, since most games are televised and the bulk of the league’s revenues come from its network contracts. What’s more, with the right stadium deal and enough corporate sponsorship, team owners can make as much (or more) money in smaller cities as they can in larger ones. That’s why the N.F.L. does just fine despite not fielding a team in 21 of the country’s top 50 markets — including such enormous metropolitan areas as San Antonio, Las Vegas, Orlando and (of course) Los Angeles. Nor does the N.F.L., which now has 32 teams, have much incentive to expand. On the contrary: expansion dilutes the TV money. (Greg Aiello, the N.F.L.’s spokesman, told me that “expansion isn’t on the table right now.”) Joe Nocera is a business columnist for The New York Times.

Sports - Baseball - MLB: Twins rout ChiSox Mon, May 28, 2007 QUOTE OF THE DAY Eligible Canadians for the MLB Draft: Minnesota Twins' Jason Bartlett is hit by a pitch from Chicago White Sox starting pitcher Jose Contreras during the second inning of a baseball game, Monday, May 28, 2007, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Paul Battaglia) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The Minnesota Twins don't need any extra motivation when they play the Chicago White Sox. But if someone like A.J. Pierzynski wants to provide a little extra push, they'll take it. The Twins rallied after manager Ron Gardenhire hollered at all four umpires when Pierzynski appeared to spike first baseman Justin Morneau, turning a one-run deficit into a 10-4 win on Monday. "I guess (A.J.) woke up a sleeping dog, and you don't want to do that," Twins centre fielder Torii Hunter said. "But, A.J., I don't think he meant anything by it." Nick Punto, Hunter and Jason Tyner each had three hits and Mike Redmond drove in three runs for Minnesota. The game's intensity level rose after Pierzynski, a former Twin, possibly spiked Morneau, a native of New Westminster, B.C., while running out a double play to end the White Sox half of the sixth inning. Gardenhire stormed out of the dugout before the White Sox took the field and yelled at the umpires for about a minute. The manager said after the game that he was upset at first-base umpire John Gibson for telling the Twins' dugout to stop talking to Pierzynski. According to Gardenhire, Gibson looked in the Twins' dugout and made a motion across his throat to try and quiet the team down. Gardenhire did not appreciate the gesture. Gardenhire spoke with Pierzynski after the game and cleared up any misunderstanding. "I met with A.J. and it's over with," he said. "He explained it to me and that's good enough for me." Pierzynski was asked after the game if his reputation had anything to do with the incident. "Doesn't it always?" he said. "It's part of it. I just don't want it to turn into a big thing. I don't want it to fester. That's why I went to Gardy right away and tried to clear the air. I would never try to do anything like that. We don't want to make these guys mad. Every time we do, they score 10 runs." Either way, the incident appeared to fire up the Twins, who scored five times in its half of the sixth to take an 8-4 lead. The Twins tied it on a Punto infield single and took the lead when Hunter chopped one off the plate to for another run-scoring infield single. "You got to do what you got to do," Hunter said. "High choppers are part of the game." Redmond followed with a bases-clearing three-RBI double off Chicago reliever David Aardsma. Twins ace Johan Santana uncharacteristically coughed up an early 3-0 lead by surrendering home runs to Luis Terrero and Paul Konerko in the third and fourth innings, respectively. Chicago took a 4-3 lead on Konerko's two-RBI single in the sixth. "Four runs against (Santana) is like scoring 20 runs against anybody else," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. "But we pitched real poorly today." Santana (6-4) zeroed in after the sixth. He pitched eight innings, allowing four runs and seven hits. The reigning Cy Young winner struck out seven. A highlight-reel catch from Hunter in centre field helped, too. Hunter climbed the wall in right-centre field to rob Jim Thome of a home run in the eighth, bringing the 27,090 in the Metrodome to their feet. The Twins got to White Sox starter Jose Contreras when he is most vulnerable - the early innings. The Twins scored three times in the second inning on singles from Tyner, Punto and Michael Cuddyer. Contreras (4-5) has allowed 21 of his 34 runs this season in the first two innings. He gave up seven runs over 5 1-3 innings, allowing 10 hits. "From the beginning, Jose was really struggling to find the plate," Guillen said. "And the bullpen, they've been doing bad lately. They didn't throw the ball good." Minnesota added two more in the eighth inning, one on a throwing error by Pierzynski., who overthrew third base with Hunter stealing. The play prompted many in the Metrodome to begin a mock chant of "A.J., A.J." After the game, Morneau, downplayed the incident between him and Pierzynski. Morneau came to the plate in the bottom of the sixth, and Larry Vanover stepped in front of Pierzynski to keep things cool. "He clipped my foot a little bit, whatever," said Morneau. "He talked to me when I went up to the plate and he said he didn't know he did it. It's done." Notes: Darin Erstad extended his hitting streak to 12 and Jermaine Dye to 14 with first-inning singles. ... Santana has pitched at least five innings in 102 straight starts. ... The White Sox entered Monday's game last in the AL in batting average (.236), runs scored (188), on-base percentage (.312) and slugging percentage (.376). ... Morneau went 0-for-5 and snapped his 10-game hitting streak. What should Bud Selig do when Bonds breaks the record?

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, speaking before the start of the Stanley Cup Finals here Monday, said there is no mandate to make any changes but officials want to study the trend and the reasons behind the drop in goals. "Scoring during the regular season was off about three-tenths of a goal a game and the scoring in the playoffs is off about a goal a game," he said. "We're going to look at it with the competition committee. We're going to look at it with the [general] managers and ultimately with the Board [of Governors]," Bettman said. "The first judgment that will have to be made is, is that a significant issue and is that something we need to address?" he said. "Even-strength goals are actually up. There are less penalties, not because we're relaxing the standard, but because everybody's adjusting to it. So the number of power-play goals is where the falloff was in scoring," Bettman said. Bettman also said that the league might look more favorably upon a bid to move a team to Canada by Jim Balsillie, who has signed a letter of intent to buy the Nashville Predators after a bid to buy the Pittsburgh Penguins was rejected. Bettman stressed that no move is in the planning stages and Balsillie has told him that there are no plans to shift the team to Canada, as he had hinted might happen with the Penguins. But Bettman also said he is intrigued by the idea of having another team in hockey-mad Canada. "That's something that, while we haven't studied it, seems to be more likely than it was three, four, five years ago," Bettman said. "If the right circumstances presented themselves and there was an interest in a real meaningful, material way, it's something we would have to obviously look at seriously. But beyond that, we haven't gone to the next step," he said. Bettman did note that the Predators, who have struggled to draw fans despite a strong season on the ice, have a 14-year lease but said that an escape clause could see the team free to leave much sooner. Bettman also addressed the controversy around former Phoenix Coyotes associate coach Rick Tocchet, who on Friday pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to promote gambling and promoting gambling. "Rick Tocchet pled guilty to a Grade 3 felony. He has yet to be sentenced," Bettman said. "I'm not really in a position to say what's going to happen until there's a complete disposition of his case.

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070531.SENSNAT31/TPStory/Sports&cid globeandmail.com: Pahlsson steals the spotlight Letters to the Editor 2007 STANLEY CUP: NHL: GAME 2: DUCKS 1, SENATORS 0 Pahlsson steals the spotlight Anaheim's top checker scores game's lone goal, gives Ducks 2-0 series lead -- This has turned into a Sami Pahlsson-type of spring. The Anaheim Ducks' centre, who has found the National Hockey League playoff spotlight because of his stingy work on the defensive side of the puck, continued to lift his team with some timely offence. Pahlsson, who scored the series-winner against the Detroit Red Wings to put the Ducks into the Stanley Cup final, scored only his third goal of the playoffs on a screen shot with 5 minutes 44 seconds remaining to give the Ducks a 1-0 victory over the Ottawa Senators last night and a 2-0 lead in the series, which will shift to Ottawa for the next two games at Scotiabank Place on Saturday and Monday. The game-winning play, which transpired before a sellout crowd of 17,258 at the Honda Center, began when Senators forward Dany Heatley turned the puck over at the Anaheim blueline. Print Edition - Section Front Instead of dumping the puck in, Heatley attempted a cute pass to linemate Jason Spezza and the puck squirted to Pahlsson. Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson was unable to stymie his Swedish countryman on the backcheck and Pahlsson's shot beat Senators goaltender Ray Emery, who was screened by Ottawa defenceman Joe Corvo. &#34;On that particular play, we turned the puck over and Alfredsson couldn't get his stick on him,&#34; Senators head coach Bryan Murray said. &#34;That's been the key. We're committing turnovers and creating chances for them.&#34; The Ducks' checking line also scored the game-winner in the first game of the series, when Travis Moen put the puck into the net late in the third period on Monday. &#34;[Anaheim's] defence and checking line have been the stars so far,&#34; Murray said. In the territorial play, the Ducks completely dominated the second game. They outshot the Senators 30-16 (60-36 in the series so far), missed 18 more, while the Senators blocked 20 more. Ottawa, on the other hand, has had difficulty generating any sustained periods of offensive pressure. &#34;They keep the puck on the outside very well,&#34; Murray said. &#34;We had some good fore-checks, but couldn't take advantage of it. &#34;We have to take advantage of our home ice.&#34; Senators forward Peter Schaefer had a half-open net to shoot at with slightly more than three minutes remaining, but his rebound attempt was deflected wide off the stick of Anaheim defenceman Sean O'Donnell. Ducks goalie Jean-S&#233;bastien Gigu&#232;re earned his sixth career playoff shutout as he blanked the Senators, who have not scored in the past 90:24 of the series. The Senators showed up for the the second game with new line combinations, as Murray decided to split up his No. 1 trio of Spezza, Alfredsson and Heatley, although they were together on power plays. Spezza and Heatley played alongside tough guy Chris Neil, while Alfredsson played with centre Mike Fisher and Schaefer. The Senators' third line featured Chris Kelly between Antoine Vermette and Mike Comrie. Murray replaced fourth-liner Patrick Eaves in the lineup with Oleg Saprykin, who scored a game-winning goal early in the Eastern Conference final against the Buffalo Sabres. So how did the Ducks counteract the Senators' alterations? Head coach Randy Carlyle kept his checking specialists - Pahlsson, Rob Niedermayer and Travis Moen, the hero of the first game - against Spezza. The Ducks' No. 1 unit of Andy McDonald, Teemu Selanne and Andrew Miller went up against the Alfredsson line. Both teams had three power-play opportunities in the goalless opening 20 minutes. The Senators had a 68-second 5-on-3 advantage, during which Comrie slammed a rebound attempt off the post. The Ducks had two close calls early in the period, but Emery stopped shots by Selanne and Ryan Getzlaf. The Pahlsson line got the better of its opponents early in the second period, but either failed to finish or could not find a way to beat Emery. Spezza was reunited with Alfredsson and Heatley later in the second period, a move recommended by former Detroit Red Wings head coach Scotty Bowman when he discussed strategy with Murray earlier in the week. Bowman counselled Murray to break up his big line, only to reunite it periodically. Number of 5-on-5 goals for the Ottawa Senators during the first and second games of the Stanley Cup final. Sami Pahlsson of the Anaheim Ducks skates by Ottawa's Daniel Alfredsson to score the game-winner with less than six minutes to play in the third period. For the second game in a row, Ottawa fails to score on a 5-on-3 advantage.

http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/n/a/2007/05/30/sports/s152343D82.DTL&cid Twins' Rally Leaves Guillen Envious Twins' Rally Leaves Guillen Envious By DAVE CAMPBELL, AP Sports Writer Wednesday, May 30, 2007 (05-30) 15:23 PDT MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Twins pieced together another small-ball comeback, leaving Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen a little jealous &#8212; and mostly furious. Torii Hunter's four-pitch, bases-loaded walk forced in the winning run with two outs in the ninth inning and sent the surging Twins past the struggling White Sox 7-6 on Wednesday for a three-game sweep. About 19 months after Chicago's World Series title, Guillen was so frustrated by another flat performance that during his latest rant he almost sounded resigned to losing his job. "I'm going to get fired? Good. Is this team going to get better having me out of there? I'd be too happy with it. But as long as I'm here, we've got to play better. As long as I'm here, we have to play better," Guillen said after the fourth straight loss by the White Sox (24-24). Minnesota moved past Chicago into third place in the AL Central, rallying from a 6-1 deficit after 2 1/2 innings against Jon Garland. After beating the White Sox by a combined 19-6 the first two nights, the Twins won for the ninth time in 12 games thanks to a bunch of walks and bouncers &#8212; plus excellent defense and plain old good luck. "They compete as a team. They get you as a team, and that's why they win," said Guillen, who alternated between blaming himself and criticizing his players throughout his postgame remarks. Guillen has long been impressed by the Twins, who sped by the slumping White Sox last summer on the way to their fourth division title in the last five years. But he pinned most of the afternoon's performance on the visiting team. "Offense, defense, pitching, manager, coaches, we all stink," Guillen said. Facing Mike MacDougal (1-2) in the ninth, Jason Tyner drew a one-out walk and moved to second when Nick Punto hit a chopper to Paul Konerko for a possible double play. Konerko's throw grazed Tyner before hitting shortstop Alex Cintron in the right knee for an error on the first baseman. "It was just a bad throw, not really a fluke," Konerko said. "I've made that play a million times." Cintron fielded Michael Cuddyer's grounder deep in the hole, but his throw to second was not in time to force Punto. Boone Logan retired Justin Morneau, but David Aardsma was summoned to face Hunter and walked the free-swinging slugger on four pitches to end the game. "I thought it was pathetic," Aardsma said. Hunter, who finished with three RBIs and leads the team with 45, wanted to swing the bat, of course. He lobbied for the green light when the count went to 3-0. "I saw the ump say, 'You need to come touch first base,' and I was like, `Oh, OK,'" Hunter said. "I didn't know what to do. It was weird, man. That was something totally different. But I like it. We won." Chicago gave up 47 hits over the previous three games. While Garland allowed just five in six innings, the right-hander walked five and struck out only two. He took that 6-1 lead into the bottom of the third and walked the leadoff batter, Jason Bartlett. Punto and Cuddyer walked, too, loading the bases with one out and bringing a frustrated pitching coach, Don Cooper, out of the dugout. Morneau hit a sacrifice fly, and Hunter followed with a two-run double on the first pitch he saw to cut the lead to two. In the sixth, Garland gave up an RBI groundout to Jeff Cirillo and an run-scoring single to Chris Heintz that tied the game at 6. Heintz's hit took Scott Baker off the hook. After a stellar debut for Minnesota 11 days earlier when he replaced Sidney Ponson in the rotation, Baker has regressed in his last two starts. Some of his breaking balls missed the plate by a few feet and he gave up six runs and 10 hits in only three innings &#8212; including Rob Mackowiak's two-run homer. Manager Ron Gardenhire, however, was most disappointed by Baker's failure to cover first base when Morneau made a diving stop of Cintron's grounder in the second. "Those are things that you can't get away with at this level when you're trying to win ballgames," Gardenhire said. The Twins got away with it, though, by doing just about everything else right. Jason Miller, Matt Guerrier, Pat Neshek and Joe Nathan (2-1) teamed up to throw six hitless innings in relief, and Jason Kubel's jumping catch against the left-field wall to take a homer away from Tadahito Iguchi in the top of the ninth highlighted a series of standout defensive plays in the late innings. "Guys start getting confident, and that's what happens," Gardenhire said. Notes:@ Of Minnesota's 26 runs in this series, 18 came with two outs. ... This was the final game as Minnesota's official scorer for Tom Mee, the first employee hired by the organization when the franchise moved from Washington before the 1961 season.

That is an exaggeration, of course, but it seemed inevitable on Wednesday. Skip to next paragraph Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press, via Associated Press Umpire Chad Fairchild separating Alex Rodriguez and Blue Jays shortstop John McDonald after an infield pop fell untouched in the ninth inning. Keep up with the latest news on the on The Times’s baseball blog. Go to the Bats Blog » Times Topics: The Yankees Times Topics: The Mets Johnny Damon hit a leadoff homer in the first against Jesse Litsch as the Yankees took an early 5-0 lead. Rodriguez’s day at the ballpark began with a refusal to answer questions about his personal life, which had been splashed on the front of The New York Post. It ended with the assertion that has dogged him for four years in pinstripes: that he does not handle himself as a Yankee should. by two runs in an eventual 10-5 victory when lifted a lazy fly ball to third base with two outs in the top of the ninth inning. Third baseman Howie Clark camped under it, but he backed off just after Rodriguez ran slowly past him. Rodriguez said he shouted “Ha” as he passed Clark, who was fooled into thinking that the shortstop, John McDonald, had called for the ball. When Clark backed away, the ball dropped safely onto the turf for a run-scoring single. The Blue Jays were incensed, with umpires restraining McDonald from charging at Rodriguez. John Gibbons, the Blue Jays’ manager, had words with Rodriguez, who smiled as he stood on third base. singled in two more runs to make it a rout. “I haven’t been in the game that long,” said Gibbons, who was playing in the majors when Rodriguez was 8 years old. “Maybe I’m naïve. But, to me, it’s bush league. One thing, to everybody in this business, you always look at the Yankees and they do things right. They play hard, class operation, that’s what the Yanks are known for. That’s not Yankee baseball.” Rodriguez said he hears opposing players shouting at him on foul balls near the dugout three or four times a week. He did not admit to intentionally distracting Clark — “I don’t know what my intention was,” he said — but he pointed out that the Blue Jays had made a heady play in stealing home on Tuesday. Rodriguez said he was simply trying to win. “We’re desperate,” he said. “We haven’t won a game in a little bit now. We won the game.” It was the Yankees’ first victory in a week, and it snapped a five-game losing streak. They remain tied for last place, and they will enter this weekend’s series at Boston trailing the by 13 ½ games in the American League East. “This lifted a real cloud off us, especially with the off day tomorrow,” Manager said. “To have to carry that through the off day and into Boston would have been difficult. Hopefully, with the way we have our pitching lined up, we can start competing and have some good results.” Robinson Canó went 4 for 4 with three doubles Wednesday, and converted on his first save opportunity since May 3. Tyler Clippard wobbled through five innings for the victory, walking five and throwing 98 pitches, and Torre did not commit to leaving him in the rotation. “We know he’s probably not quite ready,” Torre said, “but he doesn’t stop competing. He works at it out there. He doesn’t stop coming at you, which is pretty impressive for a kid who’s 22 years old.” Clippard allowed three runs but made the Yankees’ first-inning outburst stand up. Johnny Damon led off with a homer, later adding a single for his 2,000th career hit. The Yankees chased the rookie Jesse Litsch, who got just two outs and allowed five runs in the first inning. It was 6-5 when Rivera bailed out an erratic Kyle Farnsworth with two outs and two on in the eighth. Lyle Overbay shattered his bat on a grounder to first to end that inning, and the Blue Jays went down in order in the ninth. Of his cutter, Rivera said, “It was moving, yes it was.” Rodriguez singled in the ninth to make it 7-5, and his verbal interference with Clark allowed the Yankees to pile on. The third base coach, Larry Bowa, said that Rodriguez did not cross a line of good sportsmanship. “If you say, ‘I got it,’ I think that’s very unacceptable,” Bowa said. “He didn’t say, ‘I got it.’ He said, ‘Hey, hey.’ They parted like the Red Sea.” Gibbons said he told Rodriguez he thought it was a bush league play, which Bowa also heard. But Rodriguez claimed not to hear anything that Gibbons or McDonald said, and not to care, either. “I could care less,” Rodriguez said. “They have their opinions. We’re looking not to get swept. It really didn’t make a difference. Mo shut them down in the ninth.” In a season that seems to get weirder every day, that, at least, was a comforting feeling for the Yankees. A second magnetic resonance imaging exam on Phil Hughes’s left ankle revealed a Grade III sprain, indicating a torn ligament. Hughes will not be allowed to throw off a mound for about six more weeks, though General Manager said the Yankees have ruled out surgery. “He can walk on it, and it doesn’t look all that bad,” Cashman said. “But it is what it is. They’ve got him in a boot. He’s been throwing with a boot on it. But it’s going to push him back, because he’s not going to be able to throw off a mound.” Cashman said Hughes’s hamstring was almost fully healed when he injured the ankle doing conditioning drills last Friday. Hughes’s timetable would make it unlikely that he could return before August. ... Joe Torre exchanged e-mail messages with , and Clemens told Torre he was looking forward to starting against the on Monday in Chicago. ... Kyle Farnsworth has just two 1-2-3 innings in 22 games this season. Next Article in Sports (2 of 26) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Young dominated the Pirates again, allowing four hits over seven innings in the San Diego Padres' 9-0 victory Wednesday night. A former Pirates farmhand, Young walked one and struck out seven. Pittsburgh has managed seven hits in 23 2-3 career innings against Young (6-3). "I think certain guys match up better against certain teams, and he obviously matches up well against us," said Jason Bay, who had one of only two extra-base hits against Young. "The three times he's thrown, obviously, we don't have a lot of him figured out yet." Mike Cameron had three hits and three RBIs and Khalil Greene's grand slam in the eighth inning gave San Diego a 7-0 lead. The Padres have won four of five and seven of nine. "It was a good win for us," Young said. "I felt good. For the most part, I was able to execute my pitches pretty well. I had decent fastball command and for me that's my bread and butter. On nights when I'm able to put my fastball where I want, I'll take my chances." Chris Duffy had two hits for the Pirates, who had won four of five. In his two previous starts against Pittsburgh &#8212; both last season &#8212; Young took a no-hitter into the sixth inning. His no-hit bid June 4 at PNC Park lasted 5 1-3 innings and he allowed two hits in eight shutout innings. On Sept. 22, in San Diego, Young lost a no-hitter with one out in the ninth on Joe Randa's two-run homer. Still, Young downplayed his supremacy over Pittsburgh. "You've got to get up for every game," Young said. "It's the big leagues and if you don't have your good stuff, teams are going to make you pay. Regardless of who it is, I just try to focus on making good pitches and try to execute my game plan. Some nights it works out and other nights it doesn't." Pittsburgh had 11 players on the roster who had faced Young before Wednesday, and they were a combined 3-for-49 (.061) against him. The Pirates went 4-for-24 against him Wednesday. "We've not been able to do much at all with him," Pirates manager Jim Tracy said. "There is deception to him, obviously, and there's something that we're not seeing." The best chance Pittsburgh had to score was in the sixth, when Paul Maholm singled with one out and Jose Bautista followed with a double. But Young got Chris Duffy to foul out down the third base line and Freddy Sanchez to fly out to center. "I don't think it's ever easy," Padres manager Bud Black said. "It just isn't. It might seem that way at times but it's not." The Padres took a 1-0 lead in the third after consecutive singles by Greene and Paul McAnulty off Maholm were followed by a sacrifice by Young and an RBI groundout by Marcus Giles. Young came up with runners on second and third and one out in the fifth. A pitch after fouling off an attempted bunt on a squeeze play, Young lined a single up the middle to score Kevin Kouzmanoff and make it 2-0. "I'm pleased with how I threw," Maholm said. "But losing, there's no consolation in saying, 'Hey I threw a good game but we lost.'" Cameron's two-out single in the eighth scored Giles and ended Maholm's night. Jonah Bayliss entered the game and walked two batters before Greene's shot to straightaway center. It was the second grand slam of the shortstop's career &#8212; the other on Sept. 17, 2005, against Washington &#8212; and second of the season for the Padres. Cameron added a two-run double in the ninth. "We're not the swiftest team or the most powerful team," Cameron said. "But we've got guys who can put a good swing on the baseball." Maholm (2-7) was charged with four runs and six hits in 7 2-3 innings with five strikeouts and two walks. The Pirates have won only three of his 11 starts this season. "He did a great job tonight, he really did," Tracy said. "He takes you into the eighth inning of a 2-0 ballgame that a starter is on the other side of the field that we've had fits with. But we were very much in the baseball game. He deserved a better fate than he got." Notes:@ Pirates OF Xavier Nady was given the night off despite hitting .391 with three home runs and 13 RBIs in his past 11 games. ... The Pirates have never won a series from the Padres at PNC Park. ... With one game remaining in the month, San Diego has allowed 65 runs over 26 games. That is the lowest total in the majors this month by 34. Get up to 50% off home delivery of the Chronicle for 12 weeks!

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) BOSTON - Even the most selective team in the league couldn't coax a walk out of Paul Byrd. Putting his pitches where he wanted, Byrd extended his walkless streak to 43 innings and threw first-pitch strikes to 25 of 27 hitters as the Cleveland Indians beat the Boston Red Sox 8-4 Wednesday night. "I don't know that I take pride in a walk streak. I take a lot of pride in making them earn their way to first base," he said. The loss snapped a five-game winning streak for Boston (36-16), which has the best record in the majors. Cleveland (32-19), with the AL's second best record, overcame a 2-0 deficit after four innings and avoided being swept in the three-game series. Byrd (6-1), who won his fifth straight decision, issued his last walk more than a month ago , to Kenny Lofton of Texas on April 26 , and has gone six games without throwing four balls on any at batter. The only Cleveland pitcher in the last 50 years with a longer streak than 43 innings is Dick Donovan, who went 45 1-3 in 1963. In 58 innings this year, Byrd has walked just three. Stopping the Red Sox from walking is impressive, considering they lead the league with 221. Cleveland catcher Kelly Shoppach said Byrd's ability to throw pitches close to the plate, but not down the middle, entices opponents to swing. "They may not get the pitches they want to hit. That's why they take them," Shoppach said. "As a pitcher and catcher, we want to attack them. We want them to swing the bat." Shoppach was the most productive swinger with a career-high four hits, including a solo homer in the eighth. The former Boston farmhand led Cleveland's season-high 18-hit attack. Daisuke Matsuzaka (7-3) allowed 12 in 5 2-3 innings. "Not only my fastball, but, overall, I think I had problems with my control," he said. Matsuzaka didn't walk anyone but left more pitches over the plate than Byrd. And he didn't get his usual support. In his previous 10 starts, the Red Sox scored 63 runs for him. But they hadn't faced Byrd yet. "We knew coming in he is not going to walk anybody," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "You have to hit him to beat him." Trailing 2-0, Byrd shut down Boston until Cleveland tied the game in the fifth and went ahead 6-2 in the sixth. "He's aggressive," Shoppach said. "If they're not knocking him all over the place, they're not giving us a reason to change our game plan." Matsuzaka had won his previous six decisions but was driven from the game in the sixth when he allowed four runs despite getting help from a poor call by second base umpire Rick Reed. Former Boston right fielder Trot Nixon led off with a double and scored the tie-breaking run on David Dellucci's double. Josh Barfield singled to left, scoring Dellucci. Shoppach then singled Barfield to second. But Barfield rounded the base and was called out trying to get back when left fielder Manny Ramirez threw behind him to Dustin Pedroia, who swiped at the runner. Barfield and manager Eric Wedge argued and replays showed Pedroia missed Barfield by a wide margin. Two pitches later, Grady Sizemore hit his ninth homer, giving Cleveland a 6-2 lead and bringing Kyle Snyder in for Matsuzaka. "I don't know if he struggled as much as they hit him," Boston catcher Jason Varitek said. "They were able to get one pitch each at-bat." Kevin Youkilis extended his hitting streak to a career-best 22 games, but his stretch of multihit games ended at nine. He made a costly out in the seventh when the Red Sox loaded the bases with no outs on three singles that knocked Byrd out of the game. Youkilis struck out for the second out before David Ortiz lined the ball just foul past the right field pole then was retired on a soft liner. Mike Lowell added a two-run homer, his 10th, in the eighth. Boston had taken a 2-0 lead on RBI grounders by Varitek in the second and J.D. Drew in the fourth. Cleveland tied it in the fifth on a single by Shoppach, a double by Sizemore, a run-scoring groundout by Casey Blake and an RBI double by Travis Hafner. Notes:@ Ramirez turned 35 years old on Wednesday. ... Cleveland starters have walked fewer than three batters in the last 16 games ... Lowell extended his home hitting streak to 22 games. ...

http://www.twincities.com/sports/ci_6024127&cid TwinCities.com - Walk puts finishing touch on the Twins' 6-run rally Working Q & A Walk puts finishing touch on the Twins' 6-run rally White Sox worn out in three-game sweep Article Last Updated: 05/31/2007 12:01:40 AM CDT A happy Torii Hunter, center, is mobbed by teammates after walking on four pitches with the bases loaded in the ninth inning to send the winning run home as the Twins beat the White Sox 7-6 Wednesday. (JOHN DOMAN, Pioneer Press) Torii Hunter didn't know what to do. He had just drawn a walk-off walk, something new for the normally swing-hungry hitter. He started toward first base, turned back toward home and wondered about the protocol. "I didn't know whether to cheer or go down the first-base line," Hunter said after the Twins' 7-6 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday at the Metrodome. "I saw the ump looking at me like, 'You need to come touch first base.' " Winning with a walk is the latest way the Twins' suddenly stout offense has found to start climbing the ranks in the American League Central. In a three-game sweep of the divisional rival White Sox, the Twins hit home runs and doubles, sacrifice flies and bunts. They drew walks, worked counts and twice won with comebacks. This is not the team that decided buzz cuts were the remedy for its struggles, but this is a still a team with buzz cuts. Earlier this week, Boof Bonser said he would like to grow his hair a bit longer. Now his team has won four straight series, and Bonser doubts his locks will be lengthened any time soon. During the Twins' six-game homestand, they scored 42 runs on 69 hits. Hunter knocked in his 45th run, second in the AL. Justin Morneau improved his home run total to 16 and is only three behind Alex Rodriguez's league-leading 19. "It comes with confidence," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "Guys start getting confident, and that's what happens. We talk about it all the time. We talk about working the counts, but it comes obviously with a confident group." Wednesday, starter Scott Baker left his team in a 6-1 hole heading into the bottom of the third inning, but those once-overwhelming deficits no longer seem so menacing. Minnesota climbed back with single after single - only one of the team's seven hits was for extra bases (Hunter's two-run double in the third) - and the bullpen was flawless, holding Chicago hitless in six innings. "That was straight Piranha right there," said Hunter, who went 2 for 4 with three runs batted in and is batting .318 for the season. The Twins' sweep put them one game ahead of Chicago in the AL Central and boosted their home record to 15-14 and their overall mark to 27-25. For Michael Cuddyer, it seems like another year but the same story. "It seemed like at the same point last year, when we went into Milwaukee and won that series, we just took off after that," Cuddyer said. "I don't know if it was the atmosphere in Milwaukee that kind of rejuvenated us, but it seemed to have done it again this year. We're starting to play better baseball now, and hopefully we can sustain. "We have the same type of mentality that we had last year where we feel like we can win every game no matter if we're up, no matter if we're down, no matter what inning it is, we feel like we have a chance to win every game. It's a great feeling. I'm glad we finally got that feeling back because to be honest with you, we didn't have it two weeks ago." Before starting the series-winning streak in Milwaukee, the Twins had won only one of their previous nine series. Now 9-3 since being swept by Cleveland, they travel to the West Coast for six games before a normally successful time of the season begins - interleague play. After playing 12 games against divisional opponents in May, the Twins won't see an AL Central team again until June 29. Last season, they dominated the National League, going 16-2 in the midst of their turnaround. Things could be different this season. The Twins take on the Brewers and New York Mets, two of the best teams in the NL, along with perennially tough Atlanta and a young, scrappy Florida club. No matter the opponent, Gardenhire said his team would continue to focus on winning each series. "Right now, we have a confident offensive team that can make some things happen," he said, "slap the ball around, take good at-bats and come up with some big hits, and we're doing those things. You just have to continue that process." Kelsie Smith can be reached at ksmith@pioneerpress.com. The Pioneer Press is pleased to let readers post comments about an article at the end of the article.

But those days are long gone now. Harang became the Reds' first six-game winner by going the distance in a 4-3 victory over Houston on Wednesday. It was Cincinnati's third straight win. Harang is 6-0 over his last seven starts against Houston, which has lost 10 straight games. "A couple of years ago, I couldn't get a ball by them," said Harang, who tossed his first complete game of the season. "I remember that well." In 2004-05, Harang started nine games against Houston and was 1-5. But the last two seasons, he's unbeaten against the Astros. "I don't know what it is," Harang said. "I don't know if I'm throwing different or not. "I just go out and try to be aggressive. It doesn't matter who I'm facing. I just try to throw strikes and make them put the ball in play." Harang allowed two earned runs on six hits while striking out seven. He retired 14 straight after allowing a second-inning single to Adam Everett. "Harang was outstanding," said Reds manager Jerry Narron, who was ejected in the first inning for arguing balls and strikes. "He has given us good outings almost every time out this year. With your No. 1 guy, that's what you're looking for. It was nice to see us play some good defense behind him too." Harang (6-2) was getting his slider past the Astros all night. "That's what [pitching coach] Dick Pole said, that my slider was real tight," Harang said. "I was able to throw it down in the zone. "I went [to bench coach] Bucky [Dent] after the seventh and told him I could finish it. I figured I have an extra day off this week, so I could run the pitch count up a little [to 105]. And they were swinging early a lot." Harang impressed his teammates. "He did a phenomenal job," center fielder Norris Hopper said. "He was just doing his thing, and they couldn't get to him." The Reds jumped to a 3-0 lead in the first inning, although they lost Narron in the process. Narron saw six pitches before being thrown out by home-plate umpire Bill Welke. Hopper, who went 3-for-4, led off the game with a double and scored on Alex Gonzalez's single. An RBI double by Ken Griffey Jr. drove in Gonzalez. Griffey scored on Adam Dunn's single. It was Dunn's 500th career RBI. Hopper has gone 6-for-8 since taking over the leadoff spot Tuesday from the injured Ryan Freel. "He just puts the bat on the ball," Narron said of Hopper. "It's great to see somebody step in and do the job for us like that. I'm happy for the guy. He has put in a lot of time in the Minor Leagues to get here." Said Hopper: "I feel real good, but it's only a couple of games. I've been waiting on this chance all year to show what I can do. Any time you get an opportunity, you have to give it your best shot. It's easy leading off when you have guys like Gonzalez and Griffey and Dunn behind you. I just have to get on base and let them knock me in." The Reds have matched their longest winning streak of the year, having last won three straight during the first week of the season (April 5-7). "That's the way we should be playing," Gonzalez said. "We know we are better than we've been playing. When you're struggling, you're struggling, and you just have to forget about it. But we've got a good team, and I think we're coming out of that [slump] now." "You can just tell the atmosphere is way different in the locker room," Hopper said. "Everybody's working hard and working together, and that's all you can ask for." is a contributor to MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.

Click me to Bettman intrigued about new Canadian team NHL commissioner, Gary Bettman speaks during a press conference before the start of Game One of the 2007 Stanley Cup finals between the Anaheim Ducks and the Ottawa Senators on May 28, 2007 at Honda Center in Anaheim, California. Photograph by : Jeff Golden/Getty Images Ken Warren, CanWest News Service Published: Tuesday, May 29, 2007 ANAHEIM, Calif. -- National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman called the prospect of adding another Canadian team "intriguing" on Monday. During his state-of-the-league address before Game 1 of the Stanley Cup final, Bettman addressed issues from weak TV ratings to a drop in NHL coverage from traditional media outlets, but his most interesting comments dealt with Jim Balsillie's tentative agreement to purchase the Nashville Predators from Craig Leopold for $220 million US. Balsillie, owner of Waterloo, Ont.-based Research in Motion, maker of the Blackberry electronic communication device, has made no secret of his desire to move an NHL team to Ontario. Earlier this season, Balsillie offered $175 million US for the Pittsburgh Penguins, but later withdrew that offer. While Bettman danced around the particulars of the pending sale, the terms of the lease between the Predators and the city of Nashville would allow an owner to move the franchise next year if the team's paid attendance doesn't top 14,000 during the 2007-'08 season. The Predators averaged 13,815 fans this season. Bettman deflected questions on whether the league's board of governors would allow a relocation of the franchise - such a move would require approval from 75 per cent of the league's governors - and the possibility that Balsillie would try to put the club in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ont. What Bettman did open up about was the potential for the NHL to return to either Winnipeg or Quebec City. The Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix in 1996, becoming the Coyotes, one year after the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver and became the Colorado Avalanche. "When we had the chance to go back to Minnesota, we did because it made sense, the right ownership, the right building situation," Bettman said. "The market was strong and vibrant. We haven't studied Quebec City or Winnipeg or anywhere else in Canada, but the notion that, if it could work to put a franchise back in a place where it was once lost, feels good. It intrigues me, it's intriguing." Bettman tempered his remarks by pointing out the league wouldn't return to any market unless its officials were satisfied all conditions were in place to ensure success. Winnipeg has only a 15,000-seat arena for the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League, and that is generally considered too small to house an NHL team, in part because the arena couldn't generate enough revenue to sustain a big-league franchise. The Nordiques left Quebec City because they couldn't find an owner willing to build a new arena to replace the aging Colisee.

Not Zito, as Giants Blank Mets - New York Times Giants 3, Mets 0 Overrated? Not Zito, as Giants Blank Mets Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 31, 2007 The guy named Barry stepped into the batter’s box last night, and the booing started almost immediately. The chants came a few seconds later. “Overrated! Overrated!” the crowd screamed. Skip to next paragraph Barton Silverman/The New York Times Barry Zito improved to 5-5. He went seven innings and gave up six hits, a walk, struck out seven and lowered his E.R.A. to 4.21. Keep up with the latest news on the on The Times’s baseball blog. Go to the Bats Blog » Times Topics: The Yankees Times Topics: The Mets Barton Silverman/The New York Times Rich Aurilia was forced out on a ball hit by Barry Bonds in the third. David Wright, who had shifted near second, completed the double play. Sitting on the bench, might have chuckled. However briefly, the fans’ disdain rerouted toward one of his teammates. Barry Zito, the left-hander who spurned the ’ free-agent offer last off-season for $51 million more, a longer contract and the chance to continue living in Northern California, had apparently rankled some folks at Shea Stadium. Then Zito went out and produced a dominant pitching performance — seven scoreless innings in the Giants’ 3-0 victory — which probably bothered them even more. Overrated? Not last night. “Obviously, he was great,” Manager Willie Randolph said after the Mets were shut out for the first time this season. Almost in the next sentence, Randolph said the same thing about his left-handed control specialist, , who remained stuck at 295 career victories. He and Zito shared eerily similar pitching lines: Over seven innings, each threw 122 pitches, 77 for strikes, but the difference came in how they handled runners on base. Zito (5-5) stranded all six base runners, while Glavine, a pitch away from ending the inning each time the Giants scored, allowed them to rally with two outs and no one on base. He allowed two runs in the first and one in the third — Pedro Feliz drove in all three — then, buoyed by an extra day’s rest, stayed in long enough to hope the offense would awaken. It never did. “When their guys are hitting ground balls, I’m doing my job,” said Glavine, who scattered nine hits. “I’m just not getting the results. There’s nothing I can say to make people understand when you go out there, do what you want to do, make the pitches and you don’t get the results. It’s one of the single most frustrating things.” In 12 starts, Glavine has five victories and a 3.44 earned run average. He acknowledged afterward that considering the way he has pitched this season, he might have expected another victory here or there. But, he added, he understands that things have a way of evening out. “Three hundred is so far away right now that it’s not even part of the equation,” Glavine said. Unlike in their last meeting, Glavine kept Bonds in the park, holding him to one hit in four plate appearances. Bonds singled, grounded into a double play, was walked intentionally and grounded out, and his single contributed to the Giants’ two-run first. After falling behind, 1-2, Bengie Molina drew a walk, loading the bases for Feliz, who grounded a two-run single past In all, Glavine needed 30 pitches to set down the Giants, continuing an unsettling trend. He has not pitched a scoreless first inning since May 8, in San Francisco, and he threw more than 29 pitches in the first for the third consecutive start. “More than anything else, it’s a streak of bad luck,” Glavine said. “I’m going to give up runs at some point, they’ve just been coming too soon.” With Zito pitching, any runs were too much. On a glorious 76-degree day, Zito strolled into the Giants’ clubhouse before the game wearing a knit cap and a fleece jacket. The attire had no effect on his mood. Cool, calm and collected as always, Zito won his second start against the Mets this month and, a few players said, looked even better this time around. When he missed, he missed down. He complemented a fastball that did not exceed 87 miles an hour with a slow curve, a slower curve and an even slower curve. Of his seven strikeouts, six came on a curveball, and Mets hitters could not adjust when he jammed them with cutters. “He’s got this late movement,” said , who had one of the Mets’ six hits. The Mets put runners on base in each of the first five innings, including the first two batters in the second, then wasted Paul Lo Duca’s leadoff double (his 1,000th career hit) in the seventh. Zito finished off his evening by striking out pinch-hitter Julio Franco looking at a menacing 66-m.p.h curveball. “It’s always great coming to New York,” said Zito, who, as a member of the , pitched nine times at Yankee Stadium. “You get all these trash-talking fans saying everything they can think of to me in the outfield. That’s what makes this place special.” Asked if heard anything original, Zito said: “Not creative at all. Just blatant expletives at me. That’s all.” Staying true to his pregame promise, Willie Randolph inserted Guillermo Mota, fresh off his 50-game suspension for violating baseball’s policy on performance-enhancing drugs. He received a mixed reaction from the crowd of 41,395, although the fans clapped and welcomed him into the dugout after he pitched an uneventful eighth inning. Mota pitched a perfect ninth, too. “It’s nice to be back,” Mota said. ... On May 17, when Moises Alou was placed on the disabled list with a strained left quadriceps, he vowed to return May 28, the first day he was eligible to come off. That day has come and gone, and Alou said he was frustrated that the injury had taken longer than expected to heal. “I guess what I did was more serious than what we thought,” Alou said. “It’s something that I thought wouldn’t take that long, and I don’t know what set me back.” The earlier projection that Alou could return by the weekend seems a little premature, he said, and a more reasonable guess is that he will be activated toward the middle of next week. Alou was more optimistic about his pending return Sunday in Florida, but he tried running Monday and still felt discomfort.

Tim Duncan and Tony Parker each scored 21 points, helping the Spurs clinch the Western Conference series 4-1 and book a place in the NBA finals for the third time in five seasons. The Spurs will play either the Detroit Pistons or the Cleveland Cavaliers in the finals, which start on June 7 in San Antonio. The Pistons and Cavaliers are tied 2-2 in the Eastern Conference finals. "It's great," told reporters. "Last year we had a tough finish. To come back this year, to put the team back together, to have a healthy year myself and to go through three really, really good teams. It's great to get back here." San Antonio were leading Utah 16-11 in the first period when they embarked on a streak that set the tone for the game. Parker scored seven consecutive points to push the advantage to 23-11 and Duncan dunked on an alley oop. Bruce Bowen connected on a three-pointer before Parker drove for another basket and in less than three minutes the Spurs had a 19-point lead. "Tonight we played great, everybody from the starting five, from the bench, everybody made shots," Parker told reporters. "I think we won that game in the first quarter, and we kept the lead the whole game." The Spurs, who have defeated the Jazz 19 consecutive times in San Antonio, led 34-15 after the first quarter and 55-39 at the half. That advantage grew to 83-56 going into the fourth. Andrei Kirilenko led the Jazz with 13 points. Deron Williams, who played with a sprained left foot, and Matt Harpring had 11 each. Carlos Boozer was held to nine points and 12 rebounds. Guard Derek Fisher missed the first half while returning from New York where is daughter is undergoing treatment for an eye condition. He was 0-3 from the floor. The finals will be the Spurs' fourth appearance in nine seasons. They won the NBA title in 1999, 2003 and 2005, but lost in the second round of the 2004 playoffs and the Western Conference semi-finals in 2006. They have seven days to prepare for another tilt at the title. . All rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Mickelson aims for hat-trick over Woods Golf by Mike Brewer Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods lock horns again in this week&rsquo;s US PGA Tour event, The Memorial, with the former rating an attractive bet at 8-1 with Ladbrokes to confirm his recent superiority over the world No.1 and claim his third win of the season. Mickelson, second to his nemesis in the world order, opened his year&rsquo;s account in the Pebble Beach Pro-Am in February but looked better than ever in just his third event since turning to Butch Harmon, Woods&rsquo; former coach, when claiming a two-shot victory in the Players&rsquo; Championship at Sawgrass this month. Woods was 37th. And, whilst he has not been a regular at Muirfield Village, Mickelson has shown a liking for the 7,366-yard track on each appearance, finishing tied-11th in 1999, tied-ninth in 2002, and tied-fourth to Carl Pettersson last year. Woods, a general 5-2 favourite, can point to a hat-trick of Memorial victories from 1999 to 2001, since when he has had three other top-four finishes before missing the event after the death of his father last year. He has won three of his seven starts this year. Vijay Singh, one shot out of a play-off at Wentworth on Sunday, and Masters champion Zach Johnson, respectively priced at 16-1 and 28-1, are others to consider in a sterling field that featues the top-ten money-winners on the PGA tour. * Town / City Save to my times Yorkshire set to haunt Phantoms Bookies expect Derby to drop straight back The Test Cricket Podcast with Mark Chapman To hell and back Alan Lee on the charismatic trainer aiming to win his first classic at Epsom Epsom trainers hoping for mini-revival on Derby day Your Browser doesn't support Inline frames She relied on an oxygen machine.

(Sports Network) - The St. Louis Cardinals try to string back-to-back wins together on the road for the first time in nearly two months this evening, when they wrap up a four-game set with the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field. St. Louis became the last NL team to reach double digits in road victories on Wednesday, as Albert Pujols and Jim Edmonds homered on two straight pitches to highlight a five-run fifth inning in the Cardinals' 8-4 win. Scott Rolen finished 2-for-5 with two RBI for the Cardinals, who snapped a seven-game road losing streak and improved to just 10-16 away from home this season. Edmonds finished 3-for-5 for St. Louis, which is just 3-11 this month on the road and has not won back-to-back away games since it won four in a row from April 8-11. Todd Wellemeyer (1-1) allowed three runs on seven hits with a walk and three strikeouts over five-plus frames in the first start of his major league career. Brad Hawpe and Matt Holliday homered for the Rockies, who saw their first seven-game win streak since September 6-12, 1998 come to an end. Jason Hirsh (2-5), who is winless in his last seven starts, gave up eight runs on 10 hits with two strikeouts and two walks in 4 2/3 innings for Colorado. Getting the call for the Cardinals tonight will be right-hander Brad Thompson, who has won two of his last three starts. Thompson improved to 3-1 on the year after he surrendered three runs and 10 hits in 5 1/3 innings Saturday against the Washington Nationals. Thompson, who is pitching to a 4.72 earned run average on the year, has yet to receive a decision against the Rockies in five career outings. His only other start against Colorado came back on May 8, when he allowed a run on six hits in five innings of his team's 4-1 win. Colorado will counter with veteran Aaron Cook, who is 4-1 with a 4.11 ERA. Cook won his fourth straight decision Saturday against the San Francisco Giants, giving up a run and five hits in his first complete game of the season. All the news was not great for the Cardinals on Wednesday, as they learned that catcher Yadier Molina will miss four-to-six weeks with a fractured left wrist. Molina, who is hitting .273, left Tuesday's game in the fourth inning after being hit by a foul tip an inning earlier. The Rockies have split their six meetings with the Cards so far this year, though St. Louis won seven of nine against Colorado last season.

The Australian, seeded 14th and one of the dark horses for the title, is known for his fighting spirit and he needed it as he claimed a 4-6 3-6 6-2 6-4 6-2 win in almost three-and-a-half hours on Philippe Chatrier court. Gaudio, the 2004 champion, looked in control when two sets up but Hewitt then launched an all-too-familiar fightback and forced the Argentinian into a raft of errors. After seeing himself pegged back level at two sets all, Gaudio trudged back to his seat as he was broken again in the opening game of the decider. Hewitt, who has not gone further than the quarter-finals at the French Open, had no further problems and set up a third-round clash with Jarkko Nieminen. The Finn, seeded 20th, thrashed France's Mathieu Montcourt 6-1 6-1 6-4 on Court 3. Marcos Baghdatis found it just as straightforward as he raced through his second-round clash. The Cypriot defeated Denmark's Kristian Pless 7-5 6-3 6-4 on Court 1 to reach the third round at Roland Garros for the first time in three attempts. He will now face Jan Hajek, who beat fellow Czech Bohdan Ulihrach in five sets. Baghdatis, seeded 16th, made his name in the tennis world by reaching the final of the Australian Open last year, before losing to Roger Federer. Meanwhile, Serbia's Novak Djokovic, the sixth seed, secured a four-set victory over Frenchman Laurent Recouderc. The 20-year-old Djokovic, a quarter-finalist at Roland Garros last year, won 6-3 3-6 6-3 6-1 on Suzanne Lenglen court.

DUCKS 1, SENATORS 0 High-flying Ducks take 2-0 lead Anaheim's Corey Perry needs some ice after he's dropped by Mike Fisher (center). (MARK J. TERRILL/ASSOCIATED PRESS) By Fluto Shinzawa, Globe Staff | ANAHEIM, Calif. -- It can be no comfort to the Ottawa Senators, now down, 2-0, in the Stanley Cup finals, that the Anaheim Ducks have turned the rink into a minefield. Last night at the Honda Center, everywhere the Senators seemed to skate, they plowed into booby traps and barbed wire set by the mischievous Ducks and general Randy Carlyle, whose tactics have given his club a two-game advantage in the best-of-seven series. "The biggest thing for us is that we're getting really good back pressure," said Anaheim checking-line wing Rob Niedermayer. "We're not giving them too many odd-man rushes. That lets our D stand up and not give them the line too much. If you give them the blue line, they're going to make pretty skilled plays out there. That's been the key for us." To counter Ottawa coach Bryan Murray's No. 1 line, Carlyle has sent out Niedermayer and fellow checkers Travis Moen and Samuel Pahlsson, and blue-line studs Chris Pronger and Scott Niedermayer, asking his players to fill the roles they've been given. Last night before 17,258, the checking line did that -- and more. Pahlsson, the former Boston centerman swapped out of town for distant memories Andrei Nazarov and Patrick Traverse, scored to power his club to a 1-0 win. It wasn't enough that Pahlsson threw a game-high four hits. Or that he helped limit Ottawa's top line -- one that's begging for a breakup upon the Senators' return to Scotiabank Place -- for six shots. Or that he won 10 of 12 faceoffs, while counterpart Jason Spezza, who's sputtered on the big stage, lost 13 of 16 draws. On top of that, Pahlsson gained control of a third-period neutral-zone Ottawa cough-up, looped around, and took off. Pahlsson shook off a backcheck by Ottawa captain Daniel Alfredsson and carried the puck down right wing, stopping short at the faceoff dot. Using Joe Corvo as a screen, Pahlsson snapped a wrist shot through the defenseman's legs and past the blocker of goalie Ray Emery at 14:16. "Great shot," said Murray. "Good play on his part." As much as the center's timely score propelled the Ducks to a second straight win, it was Pahlsson and his teammates' defensive commitment that limited the Senators to 16 shots and resulted in Anaheim counterattacks. Murray, aware that Anaheim's checking line was giving his gunners fits, juggled his lineup to get his stars away from Carlyle's defensive pests. To start the game, Murray sent Mike Fisher out with Alfredsson and Peter Schaefer, and the gritty centerman set the tone by walloping Scott Niedermayer against the boards during the opening shift. But aside from several spare shifts, Alfredsson took his usual right-wing position alongside Spezza and Dany Heatley, who nearly clicked during a five-on-three power play (the second time in two games the Senators have enjoyed a two-man advantage) in the first period. Ottawa had a handful of sparkling scoring chances during the 67-second five-on-three. Winger Mike Comrie, stationed at the right post, stared down an open net but couldn't get his stick untangled. Alfredsson uncorked a pair of shots from the point that thudded off goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere, who came far off his line to cut down the shooting angle. But Giguere's best stop of the power play came on the rare occasion that Ottawa's signature play -- Spezza sending a cross-crease pass to Heatley -- actually clicked. Heatley parked himself at the post and thought, after taking a pass from his centerman, that he had some open net. Giguere, however, shifted from right to left to stone Heatley's stuff. "I thought I was able to [make] the first save and guys were on the rebound right away," said Giguere. "We got pretty fortunate to get out of that one with no goal. We've got to stop taking penalties like that. We can't afford to do that every game. It's going to end up costing us some goals eventually." Giguere made one final game-saving stop. Alfredsson, stickhandling in the left corner, fed Spezza in front. The center gathered the pass and got off a quick shot, but Giguere, stationed correctly and in perfect butterfly position, stopped Spezza's attempt with 4:20 remaining in regulation. But Giguere's teammates made even bigger saves. Late in the third, with Giguere out of position after stopping a Corvo blast, Schaefer settled the rebound and spotted open net. Schaefer's shot, however, went wide when another ex-Bruin, defenseman Sean O'Donnell, got a piece of the puck with his stick. Then in the final minute, when Emery (30 saves) went off for an extra attacker, Alfredsson wound up and ripped a slapper from the point. The shot never got through to Giguere, as Moen hit the deck and blocked Alfredsson's cannon. "It's nice to see the three players getting rewarded for all the hard work," said Carlyle of Moen and his linemates. "They play tough minutes. A lot of times the spotlight has not been directed toward them. Right now, they're in it." Fluto Shinzawa can be reached at &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Young dominated the Pirates again, allowing four hits over seven innings in the San Diego Padres' 9-0 victory Wednesday night. A former Pirates farmhand, Young walked one and struck out seven. Pittsburgh has managed seven hits in 23 2-3 career innings against Young (6-3). ''I think certain guys match up better against certain teams, and he obviously matches up well against us,'' said Jason Bay, who had one of only two extra-base hits against Young. ''The three times he's thrown, obviously, we don't have a lot of him figured out yet.'' Mike Cameron had three hits and three RBIs and Khalil Greene's grand slam in the eighth inning gave San Diego a 7-0 lead. The Padres have won four of five and seven of nine. ''It was a good win for us,'' Young said. ''I felt good. For the most part, I was able to execute my pitches pretty well. I had decent fastball command and for me that's my bread and butter. On nights when I'm able to put my fastball where I want, I'll take my chances.'' Chris Duffy had two hits for the Pirates, who had won four of five. In his two previous starts against Pittsburgh - both last season - Young took a no-hitter into the sixth inning. His no-hit bid June 4 at PNC Park lasted 5 1-3 innings and he allowed two hits in eight shutout innings. On Sept. 22, in San Diego, Young lost a no-hitter with one out in the ninth on Joe Randa's two-run homer. Still, Young downplayed his supremacy over Pittsburgh. ''You've got to get up for every game,'' Young said. ''It's the big leagues and if you don't have your good stuff, teams are going to make you pay. Regardless of who it is, I just try to focus on making good pitches and try to execute my game plan. Some nights it works out and other nights it doesn't.'' Pittsburgh had 11 players on the roster who had faced Young before Wednesday, and they were a combined 3-for-49 (.061) against him. The Pirates went 4-for-24 against him Wednesday. ''We've not been able to do much at all with him,'' Pirates manager Jim Tracy said. ''There is deception to him, obviously, and there's something that we're not seeing.'' The best chance Pittsburgh had to score was in the sixth, when Paul Maholm singled with one out and Jose Bautista followed with a double. But Young got Chris Duffy to foul out down the third base line and Freddy Sanchez to fly out to center. ''I don't think it's ever easy,'' Padres manager Bud Black said. ''It just isn't. It might seem that way at times but it's not.'' The Padres took a 1-0 lead in the third after consecutive singles by Greene and Paul McAnulty off Maholm were followed by a sacrifice by Young and an RBI groundout by Marcus Giles. Young came up with runners on second and third and one out in the fifth. A pitch after fouling off an attempted bunt on a squeeze play, Young lined a single up the middle to score Kevin Kouzmanoff and make it 2-0. ''I'm pleased with how I threw,'' Maholm said. ''But losing, there's no consolation in saying, 'Hey I threw a good game but we lost.''' Cameron's two-out single in the eighth scored Giles and ended Maholm's night. Jonah Bayliss entered the game and walked two batters before Greene's shot to straightaway center. It was the second grand slam of the shortstop's career - the other on Sept. 17, 2005, against Washington - and second of the season for the Padres. Cameron added a two-run double in the ninth. ''We're not the swiftest team or the most powerful team,'' Cameron said. ''But we've got guys who can put a good swing on the baseball.'' Maholm (2-7) was charged with four runs and six hits in 7 2-3 innings with five strikeouts and two walks. The Pirates have won only three of his 11 starts this season. ''He did a great job tonight, he really did,'' Tracy said. ''He takes you into the eighth inning of a 2-0 ballgame that a starter is on the other side of the field that we've had fits with. But we were very much in the baseball game. He deserved a better fate than he got.'' Notes: Pirates OF Xavier Nady was given the night off despite hitting .391 with three home runs and 13 RBIs in his past 11 games. ... The Pirates have never won a series from the Padres at PNC Park. ... With one game remaining in the month, San Diego has allowed 65 runs over 26 games. That is the lowest total in the majors this month by 34. Newspaper Home Delivery - Subscribe Today Privacy Policy/Your California Privacy Right Add USATODAY.com RSS feeds

The arena's allotment of tickets sold out in about 45 minutes. The best-of-seven series against the Ottawa Senators will be begin Monday, May 28 at the Honda Center. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon) NEW YORK - The days of seeking out ticket-scalpers in the shadows, ducking into alleys and dodging police for that elusive Yankees-Red Sox seat are fading fast. New York is poised this week to become the latest state to ease or eliminate decades-old restrictions on scalping. For the first time, it would become entirely legal in the state for average fans to scalp their seats on the Internet. And, for better or worse, they could sell those tickets at what ever price the market is willing to bear. The state assembly approved the changes Tuesday. The Senate is expected to follow suit, and Gov. Eliot Spitzer could sign the measure by Friday, when the state's old anti-scalping law expires. "If you have something to sell, you should be able to sell it for what it is truly worth," said Sean Pate, spokesman for the online ticket broker StubHub Inc., which lobbied hard for the change. Some old regulations would stay in place. Scalpers would still be banned from selling tickets within 1,500 feet of large arenas, like Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium, and within 500 feet of smaller venues. Large-volume brokers would still need to get a license, too. It's those brokers who have Russ Haven of the New York Public Interest Research Group worried. Haven argues that lifting the price caps will only prompt greedy opportunists to snap up every available seat, and then jack up prices. "I think this is a bum deal for consumers," Haven said. "As it is, seats to popular events are often selling for 10 times their face price." "It may be that there will be some portion of tickets that go for less than face value, but that's not what they're all banking on," he said of the brokers and ticket agencies pushing for change. Other states have also reconsidered anti-scalping laws. Minnesota tossed its old anti-scalping laws this spring. The state previously allowed tickets to be resold only at face value. A bill that would ease Missouri's ban on selling tickets to sporting events at more than face value passed the legislature and is now before the governor. Illinois and Florida also recently did away with old anti-scalping rules, and bills to ease restrictions are under discussion in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The shift has been propelled in part by the explosion of Internet ticket sales that has made it nearly impossible for states to enforce price caps. New York's old rule limiting a seller's profits to no more than 45 percent over face value has been widely ignored online. But perhaps the biggest change was a switch in business strategy by some of the sports and entertainment companies that previously fought scalping the hardest: Realizing that a multibillion-dollar market was being left untapped, a growing number of teams and theaters have been entering the secondary ticket market themselves. The NCAA signed a deal last year to resell tournament tickets through RazorGator.com. The NBA and some NFL teams have made Ticketmaster their official reseller under an agreement that gives teams a percentage of the profit when a seat is resold. "There is obviously a business opportunity here for us," said Ticketmaster vice president Joseph Freeman. Yet to be seen is how much control sports teams, theaters and concert halls will retain over the tickets being resold. Some have pushed for legislation that would limit reselling to venue-approved brokerages, in part to cut down on the possibility of fraud. Both the New York Yankees and their archrival Boston Red Sox recently made a practice of cracking down on season ticket holders caught selling their unwanted seats on the Internet, in violation of team policy. New York's new rules, if signed in their current form, would actually ban New York sports teams from taking such punitive action. "My feeling is, if I have a ticket, and I can't go to a ballgame, I should certainly have a right to give it to my brother or my cousin , and if they want to pay me for it, why should I have to go through the Yankees to do it?" state Sen. Dean G. Skelos said.

Though approved by the PGA Tour&#44; the move riled many players. This year&#44; Nicklaus said the bunkers will be "furrowed&#44;" thus indicating that they won&#39;t be quite as difficult to escape as in 2006. Here&#39;s what else the Golden Bear had to say during an extensive interview yesterday at the tournament site in Dublin&#44; Ohio. MODERATOR: Would you like to get us started? JACK NICKLAUS: I don&#39;t know what you want me to start with. MODERATOR: Maybe talk a little bit about the golf course. JACK NICKLAUS: Okay&#44; well&#44; golf course is really good. We&#39;ll start off with that. Paul Latshaw and his crew has done a really nice job with the golf course. I sort of expect that. I think that they certainly have the talent and have produced a good golf course every year&#44; so there&#39;s no reason why they wouldn&#39;t continue to do so. And they&#39;ve had a good opportunity to do that. We&#39;ve made a couple of changes on the golf course&#44; which I&#39;m always tweaking the golf course. You know I can&#39;t leave things alone. And the only things that really have been -- that we&#39;ve done this year which are really fairly minor&#44; is that we made the bunkers at the first hole sort of really fit in with the character of the rest of the bunkers on the golf course. We felt that we needed to bring the drainage up&#44; we needed to get them -- the third bunker was way out of play and we moved it back into play down the left side&#44; a little further left and down the hole a little bit. And in an effort to basically try to just encourage the fellows to play the strategy of the golf course. The eighth hole was then more for the members. Members&#39; tees were always sort of a mess there&#44; so we said we&#39;d just get the members&#39; tees in good shape&#44; and as we did that we enlarged the back tee&#44; and it adds maybe three yards to the hole&#44; so it&#39;s not a big deal&#44; but it gives the players a little more space to play from. And the 15th hole&#44; which is a pretty good change&#44; which we&#39;ve been thinking about for years&#44; 15 with equipment has become a very short par 5&#44; actually almost par 4 length&#44; as a matter of fact there&#39;s a lot of par 4s that have been that length&#44; I think it was 501 or 503&#44; and I didn&#39;t want to make it a par 4. I just didn&#39;t think it fit to me to be a par 4 type hole. And so we decided to go back&#44; and we had bleachers behind the tee so we took the bleachers out and moved them across the creek and moved the tee back a little bit&#44; and in an effort to more or less put the driver back in the golfers&#39; hands&#44; right now most of the guys have been hitting 3-wood up to the top of the hill and playing an iron into the green. Now they feel like they have to take a driver to get to the top of the hill before they play into the green&#44; and with it being one of the probably narrowest driving holes on the golf course&#44; it&#39;s going to be exciting. And with the new bleachers that we put back there behind the tee it&#39;s going to be really neat. People are going to find it to be a popular spot because they&#39;ve got the tee shot at 15&#44; they&#39;ve got 14&#44; and they&#39;ll be around to turn backwards and look up 18&#44; so it&#39;s a nice situation there. There was a rest station behind that which we have eliminated and took out&#44; and we haven&#39;t permanently relocated that yet&#44; but we have temporary over to the left of 18 now to replace that. Outside of that&#44; we haven&#39;t done much with the golf course. The bunkers which have been in -- was a bit of a controversial issue last year. What is the Tour version of this? Let me see. I never remember the word. Oh&#44; we&#39;re rough-raking the bunkers now&#44; we&#39;re not furrowing them. What we did is last year&#44; as you may recall&#44; the couple of days or the weekend before the tournament was when the idea of furrowing the bunkers came along&#44; and that went through the Tour process&#44; the Tour approved the process&#44; as a matter of fact the Tour encouraged the process&#44; and so this year we said&#44; okay&#44; what are we going to do to make it more consistent? Last year we ended up having the rake that we had for the crew&#44; and we couldn&#39;t get a rake that size because it was too heavy for the everyday rake&#44; so we had a different size rake and the teeth were not the same size&#44; so we eliminated one of the teeth -- every other tooth on the rake&#44; which left probably a little bigger furrow than we wanted&#44; but that&#39;s really all we had. This year we&#39;re consistent with the size&#44; and we really -- I don&#39;t think the players are going to find it to be a big hazard. Actually it looks about like what the bunkers looked on the Tour for 30 years until we developed the Accuform rake&#44; which is what most of the places have used for the most -- we developed that here&#44; and most of them have used it for the last 20 years&#44; which makes the bunkers very smooth&#44; and we went back basically to the rake that used to be used on the Tour&#44; and in fact most golf courses would use anyway. It puts a little ripple in the sand. Can you get a bad lie? Yeah&#44; you&#39;d be pretty hard pressed&#44; though. I went out on Saturday with that&#44; and I got in six bunkers&#44; one was a long bunker shot and the other five I hit within a foot. I said&#44; well&#44; if I can&#39;t do that I think it&#39;s going to be pretty easy for those guys. I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll be an issue this year&#44; frankly. Q. Do you mind retracing the origins&#44; just a little history lesson&#44; on your vision for this place&#44; just from the very beginning&#44; acquiring the land&#44; why you thought Dublin was it? JACK NICKLAUS: Boy&#44; you&#39;re really asking me to go back. You&#39;re really testing me to see whether this old body and mind can remember things like that? 1966 I sat at The Masters with Ivor Young&#44; and we sat there and said&#44; wouldn&#39;t that be kind of neat to be able to bring back something to Columbus that was similar to what it was at Augusta. We thought Augusta had just done a great service to the game of golf and thought that their tournament was great and certainly would be a good model to work after. And so I asked Ivor to start looking for some land. We found about 11 sites around the area. We looked at two or three of them&#44; and actually first came up -- one of them that came up&#44; came up here. It was not very big. I think it was like 250 acres or something. Maybe 150 acres&#44; the first piece was. And it was a place that I used to come up here as a kid and hunt. I never shot anything but I hunted. I looked a lot (laughter). Anyway&#44; the -- we looked at it and I liked the terrain because I remembered the terrain walking around as a kid&#44; and then we just started expanding on that&#44; and we ended up with 1&#44;260 acres or something like that ultimately. And that was about from 1966 until we started the golf course in the early &#39;70s. We did that in a public offering with the Ohio Company. We did a $9 million offering&#44; of which most of it was due to the infrastructure and the area around this. We got $2.4 million to build the golf course. I think that was spent fairly early on. Of course then because the $2.4 million -- I think we actually did the golf course for $2.5 or $2.6&#44; but we didn&#39;t have money for the clubhouse&#44; so it was a couple years before we built a clubhouse. We opened the golf course in May of &#39;74. We had a Pro-Am -- we thought of having the tournament in &#39;75. We had a Pro-Am here in &#39;75. &#39;76 was the first Memorial Tournament. I could give you more. That&#39;s pretty much in a nutshell. Q. Let me pick up there. How difficult was it then to get a tournament on the PGA Tour? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; I brought -- Joe Dye came out here with me when the golf course was just cleared&#44; and of course he liked the property. The holes were visible from just looking at it from a -- looking through the dirt and the trees&#44; and we sort of -- Joe and I really worked out and developed the idea of what the tournament would be&#44; how it could be&#44; we developed the idea of the Captain&#39;s Club&#44; honoring players of the past. I mean&#44; all that was done before the golf course was even done. And Joe said&#44; I think you need&#44; like&#44; every other tournament to try to get on the Tour. The Tour was full&#44; so you need to pay your dues a little bit. So the Ohio Kings Island Open&#44; in Cincinnati&#44; which was at Kings Island&#44; I think we did two years down there before we transferred the event up here. That was the fore runner. That was the way he justified us having the ability to move into a prime date. Q. Well&#44; now Tiger today is speaking about his event in D.C.. Annika Sorenstam has a tournament being played this week with her name on it. I don&#39;t know what is totally involved with that. I guess the point is what is the interest or the reasons for great players having their own golf tournament? JACK NICKLAUS: I suppose they just like the game. Q. Is it that simple? JACK NICKLAUS: I think that&#39;s about it. They love the game they&#39;ve played and they want to give back a little something to that game in a way of having an event to see if they can do something the way they felt like something should be done. Other times I think it&#39;s probably a promotional thing. I have no idea. Tiger&#39;s position&#44; I don&#39;t think Tiger financially has any real reason to do something like that other than I think that Tiger wants to have the event -- probably as good an event as he can have. I haven&#39;t talked to him about it&#44; so I don&#39;t really know. Q. Well&#44; he&#39;s using it to raise money for his foundation and he wants to build a learning center on the east coast of the United States&#44; which will be somewhere in the D.C. area. That&#39;s the connection. JACK NICKLAUS: Then I think that&#39;s very nice&#44; and I think that&#39;s great. The Children&#39;s Hospital has been the recipient of our benefit from day one. Columbus Children&#39;s Hospital saved my daughter&#39;s life when she was less than a year old&#44; and we felt very strong about that&#44; and so we wanted them to be our recipient of what we did here. There may be personal reasons in doing different things. Barbara and I have always been very heavily involved in what happens with kids and try to do things involved with kids. So for the Memorial to do that and the money we&#39;ve raised here for the hospital&#44; and the hospital has been very kind to us in having a Memorial wing there and so forth and so on&#44; so I think it&#39;s worked very well. The girls here in town have been our volunteers and helped us with the tournament and so forth. It&#39;s a community gathering. Q. Are you looking forward to the Pro-Am tomorrow&#44; and what can we expect out of you? JACK NICKLAUS: No (laughter)&#44; and probably about 80. That&#39;s a pretty quick question&#44; isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m being facetious. I don&#39;t play much golf anymore. Actually&#44; I came up here this weekend just because I wanted to play the golf course&#44; and I played it. I played two days&#44; I shot 79&#44; 83. That&#39;s about my game. I played it from the back. If I play from the front tees I can shoot par or close. I just don&#39;t play anymore&#44; and so to put my golf game out for public display is not necessarily something I want to do. But&#44; you know&#44; we&#39;ll do that tomorrow. I enjoy going around. It&#39;ll be fun. I&#39;ll have a good time with -- there will be a lot of people here that have been friends of mine for a long time&#44; and they&#39;ll see my half a swing that I&#39;ve got left&#44; and that will be about it. They&#39;ll watch me for about two shots&#44; and say&#44; geez&#44; wasn&#39;t it nice to see Jack out here. Then they&#39;ll go watch somebody play golf. Q. Can you draw any parallels with an eye toward history of the big three of your era and the big three today with Woods&#44; Mickelson and Singh? Are they doing some of the same things&#44; dominating their era? JACK NICKLAUS: I have no idea what they&#39;re doing today because I really don&#39;t pay that much attention to it. I know Arnold and Gary and I&#44; we were doing something almost every week together. If we weren&#39;t playing a tournament&#44; we were playing a TV match&#44; we were playing an exhibition&#44; we were doing promotions of different things. We spent a lot of time doing things together. I don&#39;t think the guys today do that. I think that&#39;s a press thing that you guys have created if you wish to create it&#44; and I think it&#39;s -- that you&#39;re just taking the three perceived best players in the game today and calling it that. If we hadn&#39;t been the big three that we had&#44; you wouldn&#39;t know what to call it. Q. What about they&#39;re winning at a rate that could be likened to your era? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; Tiger is winning at that rate. I think Phil has obviously gotten his game back of recent days. He&#39;s played very well lately. Vijay has had a good year this year. We&#39;re delighted to have them all here. I think that the last time they played together was probably&#44; what&#44; Augusta maybe? I don&#39;t know. Maybe they might have played like Wachovia maybe. JACK NICKLAUS: Oh&#44; sure&#44; they played The Players Championship&#44; sure. Phil hasn&#39;t won here&#44; but Phil has come close here. I think the other two -- obviously Tiger has won here three times and Vijay has won here once&#44; I guess. But there&#39;s a lot of other guys playing&#44; too. We&#39;ve got a pretty darn good field this year. We&#39;ve got an excellent field&#44; and I think we&#39;ve got -- have an excellent tournament&#44; and I think we&#39;ll -- hopefully at the end of the week&#44; maybe you can write something about your big three. Q. I remember last year when you talked about furrowing the bunkers it was to try to make the bunkers more of a hazard than it had been in the past. Now when you talk about rough raking the bunkers and say it shouldn&#39;t be much of an issue&#44; I guess my question is then why do it? JACK NICKLAUS: Why do it? It&#39;ll be an issue. In other words&#44; all I&#39;ve ever wanted -- bunkers I think are meant to be a hazard&#44; okay? Why have them otherwise? If they&#39;re meant to be perfect playing conditions&#44; I suppose we ought to put them right next to the cup. The whole idea is that you put them out there to direct play around the golf course for a directional or for a penal aspect if you wish to challenge that area. That&#39;s the same thing as a water hazard or anything else&#44; a water hazard being a little bit more final than a bunker. But the whole idea of the bunker and why I did the furrowing this year or the rough raking&#44; and the rough raking will still do the same thing&#44; it&#39;ll be a place you don&#39;t want to be. It&#39;s not necessarily that I want to create a hazard that&#39;s that penal&#44; I just want them to say&#44; I&#39;m really not sure I really want to be in there because a lot of times guys will say&#44; okay&#44; it&#39;s like the 18th hole here. They look at the water hazard on one side and they&#39;ve got bunkers on the other side. They say&#44; well&#44; obviously I don&#39;t want to be in the water so I&#39;m going to make sure I tug the right side&#44; and if I put it in the bunker it&#39;s no big deal. They whip out the driver and put it in the bunker and knock it on the green. Well&#44; if they put the ball in the bunker this week on the right side&#44; they could get a decent lie or they might not get a good lie. So they&#39;re going to say&#44; hey&#44; I&#39;m not so sure I want to be in there&#44; maybe I ought to play this hole the way it&#39;s designed&#44; maybe I ought to take a 3-wood or 5-wood or 2-iron and put it down there in play and play the way the hole is designed. I&#39;m trying to get them to play the golf course the way it was designed. With today&#39;s golf equipment&#44; the only thing that I know that you try to bring the really&#44; really long hitter and the average length hitter more closely together is to take the driver out of their hands on certain occasions on the golf course. That way you get the guy who&#39;s a shorter hitter to be able to compete with a longer hitter. If you let them just stand there and wail away at it all day long&#44; then the long hitter definitely has a tremendous advantage&#44; particularly with the grooves that we have today. You heard me go through the spiel about 110 top driving accuracy of the guys a couple of years ago. They obviously felt the rough was just as good as that. Well&#44; I don&#39;t want the bunker to be part of that. I want them to think about that bunker and say&#44; okay&#44; I might hug that more than the water&#44; but I really don&#39;t want to be in there so maybe it might be prudent for me to play a 3-wood off and put it in position. That&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do. The rough raking will do that&#44; okay? But the furrows&#44; the Tour was not -- the players were not happy with being totally penalized in the furrowed bunker. Now&#44; if you look at the statistics from last year&#44; the Tour average was something like 46 and a half percent of getting up-and-down. There were like 41 and a half percent or something like that here&#44; so it really wasn&#39;t that much different. 21 of the Top 30 exceeded their own average for the year&#44; were better. Carl Pettersson won the tournament&#44; hit one bunker all week. I don&#39;t know whether that was a fairway bunker or a green side bunker. I suspect it was a green side bunker. Phil Mickelson played a couple of phenomenal shots out of the bunkers here last year. I remember the 6th hole. I remember him playing a shot out of a bunker on the 6th hole and he was sitting down in one of the furrows. Can you play it? Yeah&#44; you can play it but you&#39;ve really got to be good and you&#39;ve got to be a little bit more precise. That&#39;s all we&#39;re trying to do. It&#39;s not necessarily saying it&#39;s not a recoverable area&#44; but it&#39;s a place you don&#39;t want to be. Q. When you were talking about it at first you made it sound like even you could get out of those bunkers. JACK NICKLAUS: I was talking about the green sides. The green side bunkers are not a big issue. The fairway bunkers are really the strategy of the golf course. The green side bunkers are only maybe par 5s where you might stand back at the -- the 5th hole. I really don&#39;t think you want to put it in the bunker anyplace&#44; I don&#39;t care where the bunkers are. The 7th hole&#44; a lot of guys aim for that front bunker because it&#39;s not a very difficult bunker shot if you can get a decent lie. The 11th hole&#44; I don&#39;t think the bunkers are that big a -- to get it in that front left bunker&#44; you really -- you&#39;ve got to -- it&#39;s a heck of a lot easier to hit the green than that bunker. And I think that 15&#44; either one of the green side bunkers are okay&#44; but a lot of guys there are playing -- would be very upset putting it in those bunkers because that&#39;s a hole that really is fairly accessible in two&#44; and that would be a missed shot&#44; not a place you&#39;d be aiming for. I don&#39;t think our par 5 bunkers really fall too much in that category&#44; so it&#39;s more the tee shot -- it&#39;s more the tee shot bunkers I&#39;m concerned about. Q. You&#39;ve got a strong reputation of international players this week&#44; and there&#39;s a bunch every week it seems like on Tour. There&#39;s a thought that the stronger the PGA Tour gets with international players&#44; that it&#39;s going to hurt Europe and Australia and some of these other Tours and they aren&#39;t going to be able to stick around. Any thoughts on that&#44; and was that ever an issue during your prime years? JACK NICKLAUS: What it really means is the game is becoming a global game. It&#39;s becoming -- well&#44; first of all&#44; we&#39;ve come full circle. I mean&#44; British Isles dominated the game the turn of the last century&#44; early part of the last century. The British players&#44; when they came here&#44; I think Ouimet was sort of the change of that guard in 1913. And from that period of time&#44; the United States then coming along with along with the Jones and the Hagens and the Sneads and the Nelsons and Hogans&#44; the U.S. dominated the game for quite a while. And then the game -- I think when the European Tour really became a European Tour&#44; more and more players started coming from Australia and other places&#44; when those tours started producing good players&#44; the game became more significant outside. Now I think what you&#39;re seeing happen&#44; too&#44; is that the PGA Tour has seen that we are no longer a U.S. game and that we are a world game. I think Tim has been very successful in being able to really create another level of tournaments at the top of the PGA Tour&#44; and those tournaments are really geared to a large degree to attract international players&#44; the world tournaments and of course the major tournaments and the year-end tournaments&#44; are all geared to a large degree to bring in all the best players to play in those events. And in doing so&#44; are they going to hurt some other Tours? Probably. But they&#39;re probably also going to hurt our own Tour&#44; too. I mean&#44; if you look at the guys&#44; the top players&#44; and I think this is always the issue that you&#39;ve always got to watch out for&#44; is that the top players are going to play maybe 15 tournaments a year is probably what they play. That&#39;s about what Tiger plays&#44; they might play 20 tournaments. I think most of your players from overseas will play more than the 12 or 15. They&#39;ll probably play those tournaments here that revolve in that sort of a world-U.S. Tour is what it is&#44; but they&#39;ll go back and support their own Tour to some level. You see the Europeans go back&#44; they play Wentworth last week&#44; they&#39;ll go back and play when the British Open goes they&#39;ll play there. The European Tour I don&#39;t think will suffer a lot&#44; but probably they&#39;ll see some of their players playing more events here. You&#39;ll have the same thing with Australia and Africa and Japan. You&#39;re seeing more and more of those players playing an our Tour. But they still go back and support their own tours. But that&#39;s been the case for a long time. It&#39;s been that way for quite a while&#44; and it&#39;s becoming more so that way with the coming of these new world tournaments. Q. Is it truly a global game if all the big global events are in the U.S.? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; it&#39;s where most of the sponsors are for the money. I think that what&#39;s going to happen is that you&#39;re going to find that as the international players become stronger&#44; as events -- I think Tim and I talked this morning about it&#44; he said that he thinks we need to have more of the international move into that. He asked me an awful lot of places where we&#39;re doing golf courses around the world that might be able to house in the future what&#39;s going on. Not today&#44; but within the next five or six years he sees that happening more and the necessity to do so. If you look at the match play this year&#44; there were 64 players&#44; only 22 of them were U.S. players. You&#39;re pretty blind if you don&#39;t see that the game is a global game. So if you&#39;re going to play a global game&#44; you&#39;ve got to play globally. So the U.S. Tour will probably -- the European Tour saw that quite a while ago. They started doing that&#44; and you see them&#44; they play through South Africa&#44; they play through Asia&#44; they play Australia&#44; they play quite a few places other than Europe in their cold season. So they&#39;ve truly become a global Tour&#44; also. And I think that the result of the players they&#39;re having has been reflected in the Ryder Cup and I think it reflects in the Presidents Cup&#44; too. Q. Sounds like you&#39;re saying the European Tour is a global Tour because of where they go. The U.S. is a global Tour because of who they get. JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; if you look at Europe&#44; Europe doesn&#39;t have any warm weather. Maybe the south of Spain in -- Q. They don&#39;t get any good weather in July&#44; do they? JACK NICKLAUS: I think they do. I think 4th of July summer happens&#44; doesn&#39;t it? Maybe not the 3rd or the 5th&#44; but it happens (laughter). Anyway&#44; I think that the U.S. Tour&#44; we have a lot of warm places. We don&#39;t play in the northern part of the United States in the wintertime obviously&#44; we play in the southern part of the United States. I mean&#44; I think that you have to give Tim a chance. You know&#44; he&#39;s doing&#44; I think&#44; a terrific job for the Tour. He&#39;s really trying to -- he&#39;s working very hard to keep a lot of sponsors happy. He&#39;s working very hard to keep a lot of players happy. He&#39;s trying to figure out what is best for the Tour and how to work it and how to expand it over time&#44; and he&#39;s -- I&#39;m sure he&#39;s not hesitant to have blinders on in relationship to what you&#39;re talking about. So I think time will tell and give him a chance to do so. That&#39;s the only answer I have. I don&#39;t have another answer other than you&#39;re trying to say a global Tour shouldn&#39;t be all U.S. I think he agrees with that&#44; too. Q. Fair or unfair&#44; warranted or unwarranted&#44; do you feel like the path -- the road that Tiger has to shatter your majors record is an easier road than he&#39;s been able to take versus what you had to do to get to the mark that you got to? JACK NICKLAUS: I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s an easier road or not. I think that -- I did not have a focus on that when I was growing up. That was never a focus to me until after I was over ten tournaments&#44; and somebody even pointed it out to me that I had won 10. But Tiger had&#44; I think&#44; a tougher road in a lot of ways from the standpoint that he -- from day one&#44; that&#39;s what his goal was&#44; was to surpass my record&#44; and he&#39;s been -- the press has had that from day one. That&#39;s a lot of pressure on a guy for a long time. You look at it from that standpoint&#44; I think maybe he had a tougher way. If you look at it from the standpoint of the competition&#44; I&#39;m not sure what the answer to that is. I&#39;ve said several times and I&#39;ve said lately&#44; I don&#39;t know whether -- there was a level of competition when I played&#44; and I&#39;d say some of the time I might have been just a little bit above that. And the guys today are either at the same level we were and Tiger is up here (indicating high up)&#44; or the guys today -- I had Trevino&#44; Palmer&#44; Player&#44; Watson&#44; guys that won a lot of major championships&#44; I don&#39;t know whether the guys today would maybe be a notch below that and Tiger was up here at this notch. We don&#39;t know that&#44; but there&#39;s no way you&#39;ll ever know that. There&#39;s no way to compare it. All you know is that Tiger is dominating what&#39;s going on. And when he plays and when he&#39;s playing well&#44; he is really difficult to beat. We have seen a lot of guys not be able to finish tournaments when he&#39;s playing. Is that pushing themselves beyond the level of what they are or are they trying to reach a level that they can&#39;t attain? We don&#39;t know the answer to that. We can sit there and do all kinds of things and say that the guys today can&#39;t finish and Tiger is the only guy that can play&#44; or we can say that the guys today are really&#44; really good and Tiger is just way above them. I just don&#39;t know how to answer your question because I don&#39;t think -- we never will have an answer for that incidentally. Q. I guess you could also argue that the purses are so much now that these guys aren&#39;t relying on making the money where in your era everybody was trying to make a buck and the money wasn&#39;t going around as much as it is now. JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; we didn&#39;t play golf to make a living. We played golf to create a record so we could go make a living. The guys today make a living playing golf. I mean&#44; the prize money that they play for nowadays&#44; they don&#39;t have to do other stuff to make a living. So it&#39;s a big difference from that standpoint&#44; but that wouldn&#39;t have any difference in relation to how they play golf. I think that there is a tendency for guys&#44; I think -- and it was the same in our era&#44; that guys really are satisfied with being in the Top 5 or 10 on the Money List&#44; they have a really nice living&#44; they enjoy their family&#44; they enjoy spending time at home&#44; they don&#39;t need to push it out and play 35&#44; 40 tournaments a year. There are some guys that will do that&#44; and there&#39;s some guys that fall in that category. We had some guys that fell in that category&#44; too. But I think that&#39;s human nature. I think that&#39;s the way some people are built. Some people say I don&#39;t care about being the best player in the world. This is where I make my living&#44; I do very well and I&#39;m really good at it. Do I have to be the best? No. Do I have to sacrifice all this to be the best? Maybe not. Some of them will&#44; some of them won&#39;t. Tiger does. I think if you asked the guys on the Tour and find out who probably has the best work ethic&#44; you&#39;ll probably look and find that it&#39;s Tiger&#44; Phil and then Vijay. You&#39;re talking about your three top players probably have the best work ethic. Are there other guys that have a good work ethic? Sure. Maybe some of them don&#39;t have quite as much talent as some of the other guys&#44; but that&#39;s a question that -- and plus the fact that the game is so different. I mean&#44; the equipment we&#39;re playing today&#44; the courses we&#39;re playing&#44; the conditions were playing are so different. It&#39;s at a totally different -- not only a different era but a different game. So to answer your question&#44; there is no answer. It&#39;s all guessing from all of us. But I know one thing. Tiger is one hell of a player (laughter). Q. From an architectural standpoint&#44; what makes Oakmont so special&#44; and what about &#39;62 do you remember most&#44; just about the tournament itself? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; coming into Oakmont in &#39;62&#44; I had finished second and fourth the two previous years. I felt like I had a really&#44; really good opportunity in both of those years as an amateur to win the Open. I didn&#39;t finish in either one of those. I came into Oakmont having three seconds my first year on the Tour and finishing second the week prior to the U.S. Open&#44; having a putt at the last hole to tie&#44; which was a long putt&#44; about 35 feet&#44; but I missed it. I went to Oakmont with sort of blinders on&#44; saying that I love USGA events&#44; I love the setup of the golf course&#44; I had played Oakmont in practice and I liked Oakmont&#44; and I felt like that was my week. I had no idea -- it sounds sort of stupid&#44; but I&#39;m a 22-year-old kid&#44; wouldn&#39;t have any idea that I was in Arnold Palmer&#39;s backyard. It wouldn&#39;t have ever entered my mind. It only entered my mind that this was what I wanted to do&#44; and I felt like that was going to be my week and I played it that way. I had a good week of putting. I didn&#39;t make a lot of putts&#44; but I only three-putted one in 90 holes. But I obviously made enough. I remember I got a comment on the 17th hole of the last round&#44; I had a putt for a par after I sort of drove it up by the green and sort of fluffed a chip shot&#44; pitched it about five feet by&#44; and I got a note from Bobby Jones that said I came right out of my chair when you hit that putt. I whapped it downhill&#44; one of those&#44; about five feet. It was kind of a -- and then of course I got -- Arnold couldn&#39;t have treated me nicer during the week. We played the first two rounds together&#44; and then of course the playoff. It sort of started a rivalry&#44; as you might say&#44; in our competition. Oakmont is a good golf course&#44; a tough golf course. It&#39;s a golf course that I have no idea what they&#39;ve done to it this time. I know that they&#39;ve lengthened some stuff on it&#44; and I hate to see them lengthen it beyond because&#44; like&#44; Oakmont was the kind of golf course that you really didn&#39;t need to try to take a driver out of their hands. The golf course in its very nature took the driver out of your hands a lot of the ways it&#39;s played. So I didn&#39;t think that length was going to be all that major of a factor&#44; but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve added some length. The only conversation I get is the 8th hole&#44; which is -- JACK NICKLAUS: That I don&#39;t understand&#44; but that was already a 1-iron or a 3-wood. It was already one of the toughest par 3s you&#39;d ever want to play&#44; and I think they added 50 yards to it? Q. 36 effectively&#44; 252 to 288. JACK NICKLAUS: It wasn&#39;t 252 when I played it. It was 230-something. I thought that was pretty long. I think Oakmont has always produced a good champion. Q. Was &#39;62 that you touched on&#44; that was kind of the beginning of everything with you and Arnold. I know you&#39;re not thinking that at the time&#44; but how special in the end -- I know you said you didn&#39;t know it was Arnold&#39;s backyard&#44; but how special was that victory? Was that the spring board for you? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; I mean&#44; it&#39;s my first win. That&#39;s pretty special. How special is your first win? And how special is it if it&#39;s a U.S. Open? I don&#39;t think I have to say more than that right there. It obviously set my career up. Q. Do you remember Arnold&#39;s kind of -- I think he made the turn at the end&#44; last round&#44; Arnold was up two or three and he stubbed one at 9 and - JACK NICKLAUS: I wasn&#39;t playing with him. I have no idea what he did at that particular time. I don&#39;t even remember what I shot the last round. I don&#39;t think I shot but 71 maybe. Maybe I didn&#39;t. Maybe I shot 69&#44; I don&#39;t remember. Q. A lot has been made of the Oakmont greens. How do they relate to other U.S. Open greens? Do they weigh more on your mind? JACK NICKLAUS: They&#39;re a tough set of greens. JACK NICKLAUS: Not necessarily faster&#44; they&#39;re just a lot pitchier. Q. When you think about this tournament&#44; how much of the popularity and the prestige of this event with the fans and players is tied to you directly and your presence here&#44; and how much is the course and everything else around it? Because for instance&#44; unfortunately&#44; the Byron Nelson this year was going on without its host. How much of this event is you and how much is everything else that&#39;s been created around you? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; I&#39;d like to think the event can stand on its own two feet without me. Obviously I think it&#39;s -- it would be kind of stupid to say that I haven&#39;t been an integral part of the event. But I think that the structure of the event -- it is The Memorial Tournament&#44; it does honor the players of the past&#44; our Captain&#39;s Club has been supportive of what we&#39;ve done. They&#39;ve been our guiding light in terms of what we&#39;ve done with the direction of the tournament. It is set in place that I can be here or I don&#39;t have to be here&#44; from that standpoint. From a personal standpoint I hope I&#39;m around for a long time to enjoy it. But the -- I think today it&#39;s probably still hard to separate me from the tournament&#44; but I think as time goes on and you look at The Masters&#44; you look at the Bobby Jones was synonymous with Augusta no matter what happened there&#44; and The Masters really has lived beyond Jones&#44; even though his -- what&#39;s the right word? Even though his legacy is there and will always be there and mine will always be here. Q. Have you thought about that much ever? JACK NICKLAUS: I don&#39;t really want to think too much about it&#44; thank you&#44; right now (laughter). I&#39;m getting old enough as it is&#44; I don&#39;t want to think too much about that. That&#39;s not necessary for people to walk around every day and think about it. Q. But are there things you&#39;ve done along the years to purposely make sure this event doesn&#39;t just have to be about you? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; I think I went through that just five minutes ago with you. Everything I just said is what we did. It&#39;s not the Jack Nicklaus Open&#44; it&#39;s The Memorial Tournament. I don&#39;t see that my name needs to be involved in the tournament&#44; period&#44; I would certainly hope it isn&#39;t. But I think that&#39;s the way -- this is the way we&#39;ve tried to structure it&#44; tried to create a golf course -- and these players come back here every year&#44; they don&#39;t come back and say&#44; gee&#44; I want to go to Jack&#39;s tournament because it&#39;s Jack&#39;s tournament. They say I want to go to The Memorial Tournament because it&#39;s a great golf course and we&#39;re treated well and it&#39;s a great event. Q. Could you tell us about Kyle Reifers and your decision to give him an exemption this week? JACK NICKLAUS: I don&#39;t know Kyle very well. I had lunch with him yesterday. I&#39;ve met him on a couple of occasions&#44; but the Captain&#39;s Club does the exemptions. I have nothing to do with that&#44; zero. I set that up a long time ago for exactly that reason (laughter). I mean&#44; I get 100 letters every year from players wanting an exemption to the golf tournament&#44; and they go right to these gentlemen sitting in the back of the room here who make the selection of who the exemptions are&#44; and thank goodness you guys do that. I appreciate that very much. Q. I believe in the past you&#39;ve been - JACK NICKLAUS: I&#39;m sorry&#44; excuse me. But we&#39;re delighted to have him here. How&#39;s that? I&#39;m sorry. Q. I believe in the past you have cited the golf ball as maybe the culprit with regards to making some of the grand old courses obsolete. This year the buzz word seems to be maybe&#44; again&#44; the U-grooves and the USGA is going to possibly look at that. Do you think those clubs should be banned and the U-grooves with the ability of the players to get the ball to check&#44; how would that play into the setup of the course? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; I think that the grooves are an issue&#44; they&#39;ve always been an issue. When we talked a minute ago with the driving -- two years ago when the Top 5 were not in the top 110 of driving accuracy and they were the top players&#44; it didn&#39;t make any difference. So obviously it was more important then to hit the ball long than it was to hit it straight. Grooves will obviously play a thing. I mean&#44; I see television and I watch the guys playing out of rough like this and I see the ball go&#44; shooooom. I say&#44; God&#44; there&#39;s no way in the world we could ever do that. I guess I could do it today because I could get those clubs. I still don&#39;t play with those clubs. I play with V grooves and I have all my life just because I like the flight of a golf ball. I personally have never liked the flight of what a U groove does because it&#39;s square grooves or whatever you want to call them. Out of the rough I like to be able to take the ball and play my trajectory and throw it up softly. Sure&#44; the way they do it today&#44; they&#39;ve tried to combat the effective what they do&#44; they get them harder than they could get them&#44; with all the technical ways they can dry out greens today&#44; to where you almost need them. Do they have an advantage with them around the green? Probably so. I think the U grooves are about that much of a problem (indicating one inch)&#44; and I think regardless of what the USGA is saying&#44; I still think that the ball is 85 to 90 percent of the problem and would solve 85 to 90 percent of our problems. And then I know that the USGA and the PGA Tour and the R & A are working on golf balls that go shorter all the time. They are going through that to try and test the manufacturers who are making them to find out what results they get back from that kind of a situation. Now&#44; if they thought -- of course they&#39;re going through U grooves all the time&#44; they&#39;re going through the trampoline effect of drivers. Obviously if they took a driver and made it smaller&#44; the size of the face would make it smaller and you couldn&#39;t have the trampoline effect that you have today. All those things are factors. But I would say the U groove is probably about that much&#44; the driver is about that much and the ball is about that much. That&#39;s my own opinion. That&#39;s opinion from observation. We have had the USGA here last year and spoke to our Captain&#39;s Club and gave us a great presentation. They felt that it was probably 80 percent grooves and head and a small part ball. They do far more research than I do. I don&#39;t do research&#44; but I&#39;ve played the game and seen it played for too many years&#44; and I see what&#39;s happened. That&#39;s my feeling. That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m right&#44; but the -- and frankly&#44; I really don&#39;t care if they play exactly the same equipment today forever. The only thing that I care about is the game itself and the historical and great golf courses that we have around the world that we play that have become non-championship golf courses&#44; or if they want to keep them championship golf courses&#44; the amount of money that is spent to bring them to a new level&#44; and what it does on a daily basis to the members of those people that play the golf courses on a daily basis&#44; and how it separates the professional game of golf from the average golfer. The whole idea of the USGA and the R & A and everybody playing the same equipment&#44; they couldn&#39;t be further apart. That&#39;s the problem. In an effort to do that&#44; it&#39;s become -- they&#39;ve become like this (indicating close together) rather than like this. Q. Have you ever had to lobby players to play your tournament? Do you still lobby? JACK NICKLAUS: Never have asked a player to play. We&#39;ve been here 32 years&#44; 33 years? Never asked a player to player in 32 years. Q. One thing about the Masters that - JACK NICKLAUS: In other words&#44; to expound on that&#44; I&#39;ve always felt like if a guy -- if we produce a tournament&#44; if we produce the purse&#44; the golf course&#44; the event&#44; handle the players and the players want to come&#44; they&#39;ll come. If they don&#39;t come&#44; they&#39;ll have their own reason for not doing it&#44; and if they do come&#44; then they&#39;ll come here because of what we provided for them. Q. Last year as I recall you didn&#39;t have Tiger for sure. Is it true that the ratings were down? JACK NICKLAUS: I have no idea. I don&#39;t read ratings. I have no idea what they were. Q. Do you think if affects - JACK NICKLAUS: Do I think Tiger affects the game? JACK NICKLAUS: I think it affects any tournament. I don&#39;t think it makes any difference what tournament you&#39;re playing if Tiger doesn&#39;t play. I think if Tiger skips The Masters or the British Open this year because he&#39;s having a baby&#44; the ratings will be changed for sure. Tiger is a very popular player no matter where he&#39;s playing. I don&#39;t think it makes any difference. Q. The observation I was going to make for whatever it&#39;s worth&#44; is the Masters&#44; I think&#44; has continued -- if you look back all the great players from every era has won that tournament. How would that help you? Do you think you&#39;re close to that here with your tournament? JACK NICKLAUS: I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re driving at. Q. Well&#44; my point is&#44; I think that the Masters&#44; there&#39;s a lot of reasons why The Masters is the Masters&#44; but one very interesting thing is you can hardly name a great player of an era that hasn&#39;t won that golf tournament. JACK NICKLAUS: We&#39;re pretty close to that here I would think if you look at our winners. That&#39;s part of a good tournament. Part of a good tournament is produce good winners. But also give it the ability to have a dark horse&#44; as you might say&#44; win&#44; or an underdog&#44; however you want to call it. If you have somebody who is not necessarily given the ability to be able to get there&#44; that&#39;s -- see&#44; that&#39;s the one criticism that I&#39;ve had of recent years of Augusta is that I felt like the things they&#39;ve done to the golf course have reduced the chances of getting a broad spectrum of players from the shorter hitter to the moderate hitter to the big hitter&#44; giving them a chance to win. That&#39;s one of the reasons why I&#39;ve lengthened some things here but I&#39;ve resisted in lengthening everything here. I&#39;ve tried to create a little bit more variety in that and keep my short holes&#44; keep my -- the 3rd hole&#44; the 14th hole here&#44; the 9th hole are not very long holes&#44; and they play -- and they give the -- and our par 5s are not extremely long. And they give the average hitting pro a good chance to play it rather than just the power hitter. Now&#44; Augusta has also started to narrow it in&#44; too&#44; with the power&#44; so they&#39;re working in that direction. But I think it&#39;s still the stronger hitter that has a better chance at Augusta than the other guys. Q. With respect to Tiger&#39;s effect on the game&#44; do you think it&#39;s better for the game if he would have a rival who would measure up to him? JACK NICKLAUS: I guess if somebody can play that well. That&#39;s all it amounts to. That was the thing I was going through earlier. I said&#44; are all these guys down here and he is way up here&#44; or are all these guys down here with the list of other good players that have ever played&#44; and he&#39;s that far above them? We don&#39;t know the answer to that. We don&#39;t know if anybody can get to that level. Right now nobody is. Q. There seems to be this feeling that Phil with Butch might be capable of getting to that level. JACK NICKLAUS: (Shrugging shoulders) I guess you&#39;ll see. Phil is a very&#44; very good player&#44; been a good player for a lot of years. Phil went a long time before he won his first major. When he won his first major&#44; then he learned how to do that&#44; and he&#39;s won several since then. He is probably obviously the closest to that situation at the present time&#44; and he&#39;s still young enough that he still has years to go in that. Q. I mean&#44; you remember - JACK NICKLAUS: Is it good in the game to have more than one guy? Yes&#44; of course it is. Q. Because your rivalry with Arnold&#44; more people got interested - JACK NICKLAUS: When Arnold and Gary and I were playing&#44; it was like if one of us didn&#39;t come to the tournament&#44; the tournament was a total failure. Well&#44; at least we had three of us they were talking about. Today if Tiger doesn&#39;t come&#44; they say it&#39;s a total failure. I mean&#44; that&#39;s a pretty big burden to be put on one guy. Is that really fair? There&#39;s really an awful lot of good players that produce an awful lot of good tournaments out here&#44; good golf. Q. I guess that&#39;s a good question. A lot of tournament directors moan and complain about field sizes and who&#39;s in the field and Tiger is not there and it&#39;s a disaster. You&#39;ve run this tournament or the Captain&#39;s Club for years and years and years. Is it that important that certain players come to your event? Can&#39;t you run a successful event and a good event without having a Tiger Woods or a Phil Mickelson in it? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; we can&#44; but you guys won&#39;t let us (laughter). That&#39;s part of it. I mean&#44; did we have a successful event last year? I think we had a great event last year. Tiger wasn&#39;t here because of his father&#44; but Tiger supported us very well here. I certainly never have a complaint about Tiger. I&#39;m just delighted that he wants to come and play here. You know&#44; can we have an event without a player? Sure&#44; of course we can. Do I want to? No&#44; I want to have all the best players here. That&#39;s what we all want to have. All tournaments want that. Why wouldn&#39;t they? I&#39;m going to have a tournament next week and I&#39;m going to put up whatever prize money we&#39;re going to play for and I don&#39;t want any of the Top 10 to come because I want to see if we can -- come on. Q. My question is you said you don&#39;t look at ratings. You have the same sponsors of the event - JACK NICKLAUS: No&#44; I don&#39;t. I have no idea what our ratings were last year. My guess is they were probably down because Tiger wasn&#39;t here&#44; but I have no idea what they were&#44; and I have no idea how that related to the rest of the Tour and golf last year. I just don&#39;t have a clue. Morgan Stanley might (laughter). Q. But with everything you put into the event&#44; the event was still successful&#44; you still made a lot of money for charity&#44; and you still did everything you wanted to do? JACK NICKLAUS: Absolutely&#44; absolutely&#44; so we&#39;ve just got to get you guys to write differently (laughter). MODERATOR: Mr. Nicklaus&#44; thank you very much.

It goes deep into one issue and then bounces around to a plethora of smaller ones ... and does it all in a way that will make you feel like the prettiest girl at the cotillion. Bookmark , and visit daily. Kobe Bryant trade imbroglio ends up being very bad news for two people: Andrew Bynum and the Lakers "insider" who told the LA times that Kobe Bryant forced the Lakers to trade Shaquille O'Neal. I don't know who you are, , but right about now might be a good idea to touch up your resume. You almost cost your organization its most prized asset. In the business world, this is frowned upon. It's like an employee walking into Kentucky Fried Chicken headquarters tomorrow and announcing to that he sold his secret recipe to Boston Chicken. If Kobe wants the anonymous insider fired, then firing him should be the that the Lakers do to him. Assuming that the insider is anyone other than Jerry Buss (and who knows, it could be Buss; if you get that guy liquored up, he'll do anything ), Kobe is obviously far more important to the organization. If Kobe wants them to pour sugar in the guy's gas tank, then send Smush Parker to the store to pick up a bag of When a team has a player like Kobe Bryant, they keep him at all costs. How many players in the league are world champions, proven clutch performers, have a complete offensive game, exert themselves on defense, and can score in every conceivable way? It doesn't matter what he wants done. Do it. If it's necessary, build a Kobe Bryant statue in front the Staples center just like the Jordan statue in Chicago. In fact, it shouldn't just be a statue, it should be a fountain. Just like the one to your right, except it would be Kobe peeing on the face of the Lakers "insider." Kobe might like it, and it would look fantastic in front of Staples. The insider may be a perfectly nice man or woman, and an otherwise valuable employee. And really, it doesn't even matter if what he said about Kobe is factually accurate. What matters is that Kobe wants him gone. I hate to call for anyone to be fired, but if Kobe wants it, it's going to happen. Does the insider believe that Kobe has the juice to force a Shaq trade, but he couldn't get any The question is, though, what else does Bryant want? And this leads us back to Andrew Bynum, whose fate was sealed yesterday the second Kobe told Stephen A. Smith he wanted to be traded. Even after Kobe rescinded his request, the message will still there: he's serious about this, he's had enough front office failings, and he will continue to embarrass the organization until he's satisfied. He's forced their hand. And hey, someone had to. There's an overwhelming likelihood that Bynum is history. He's the most valuable young trade chip the Lakers have, he's been the sticking point in previous uncompleted deals, and using him as trade bait is the Lakers best chance at pacifying Kobe. A trade is still going to happen, it's just not going to be Kobe. It's going to be Bynum, for someone who Bryant likes. And that's the best thing for everyone, the Lakers organization included. There's a reason that you can't get equal value in a deal for someone like Kobe ... because any other player in the league that it's in the same stratosphere as Kobe is not going to be traded . The Lakers would've ended up taking a collection of lesser players (which never, ever works out for the team giving up the best player), draft picks (unless they're the #1 or #2 pick in this year's draft, not a surefire recipe for success), or expiring contracts to be converted to cap space (in recent years, proven to be vastly overrated). There were no options the Lakers had that would've improved their team, or even kept it afloat. Tracy McGrady? Unless he comes with a set of attachable testicles that he's never before used in his career, that's a clear and significant downgrade for the Lakers. Kevin Garnett? That's a little too " Gift of the Magi " for me. Both guys have always wanted to play with someone like the other one, but it ends up being, "Awww, I traded my Garnett to get you a Kobe!" "But I traded my Kobe to get you a Garnett!" The end result leaves both of them in the same situation they're in now. Trading him would have been a disaster. Equal value was a pipe dream, the fans would have revolted, and the organization would have lost their cash cow. And they'd have had a roster no better than that of Portland, Minnesota, Sacramento, or Memphis. Five years from now, the Lakers might be looking back on May 30th, 2007 as the day their franchise was saved. Twice. Kobe saved them the first time by spurring them into action, hopefully helping them to see that wasting the prime of the most dynamic scorer in the NBA is a bad idea. And then Phil Jackson saved them a second time by talking Kobe off the ledge and back into a Laker uniform. Kobe Bryant will take some heat for what he did yesterday. He'll be called selfish, instable, insane, etc. But if you're Kobe, how does sitting idly by while the franchise wastes your prime help anyone? He did the right thing. For himself, for the league, for the fans, and for the Lakers. Someday, they're going to thank him for it. I'm considering adding a mailbag feature to The Debriefing. No promises, we'll see how it goes. If you've got a question (about something you've read here, or about any issue on your mind, sports-related or otherwise), feel free to drop an e-mail to: Oh, you're damn right I will be watching when. I agree , that's fantastic. The black and white, the old school warriors, the stone determination on the faces, tying yesterday to today ... for a promo spot that doesn't involve the Pussycat Dolls, that's not bad, ABC. And somewhere, Craig Sager breathes a sigh of relief. That's a really nice flower on your lapel, Don Cherry... it'd be even nicer if anyone could see the damn thing. I guess Don isn't ready to let go of the " " trend just yet. They won't let him wear shorts, so he makes a whole damn suit out of it. Quickly on Spurs vs. Jazz, Game 5 ... &bull; Something I'm pretty sure the Jazz didn't want to hear today: "Leading scorer, Andrei Kirilenko." No member of the Jazz had more than 13 points. &bull; Someone owes Derek Fisher an apology. Fish went to a lot of trouble to get from his daughter's eye procedure in New York to last night's "game" in San Antonio. He didn't get there until halftime, and by then, all was over but the shouting. Actually, the shouting was over, too. The Spurs don't shout. &bull; If there's such a thing as a key stat in a complete and utter blowout, it's this: Spurs: 22 assists, 7 turnovers. Jazz: 13 assists, 12 turnovers. &bull; If you want to see a competitive NBA Finals, hop on the Pistons bandwagon. The Pistons, if they get there and they manage to bring an appropriate level of intensity, could at least compete with the Spurs. The Cavaliers would make the Jazz look like the '92 Bulls. Seriously, if the Cavs win the Eastern Finals (a real possibility, given Detroit's afore-mentioned intensity problem), the Spurs might as well face the Washington Generals. They would be the worst team the Spurs have faced yet in the playoffs by a wide, wide margin. Fair Warning, Otter ... The newest scourge of America's golf courses: . A couple of golfers were attacked on a Florida golf course by rabid otters who were pissed off about something or other. "There's a pond on that hole -- it's a short par 3," Stafford said. "(The otter) was on the grass. He or she was just staring at me. "All of a sudden he charged me and bit my ankle," she said. "There are three punctures." A word to the wise to any otters who might be reading: you better wait until I don't have a club in my hand to attack me. I'm a nature-lover, but if you're foaming at the mouth, and you snarl your otter teeth at me, I'm tattooing your adorable otter face with a titanium 3-wood. Well Hello, Brand New Professional Football League ... I cruised around a few blogs earlier looking for opinions on , the brand spankin' new football league in which Mark Cuban will own a team. And the general consensus seems to be that it will die a quick and laughable death . I'm not writing it off that quickly. Here's the biggest reason I give them a chance: the NFL's current collective bargaining agreement sucks for the players. Hockey players might even get better deals. Only signing bonuses are guaranteed, and unless you're a first-round pick, that signing bonus is going to be no great shakes. Would a guy like 2nd-round draft pick Dwayne Jarrett take a 4-year, $6 million guaranteed deal over what he's going to end up getting from the Carolina Panthers? Maybe, maybe not. But it's not a ridiculous notion. Would they be able to land any star players? Not in their prime, no. At least not right away. But aging veterans in the NFL tend to get shoved out the door. No one wants to pay an established veteran when they can get a younger guy much cheaper: it happens to running backs all the time. If the UFL existed right now, who's to say they wouldn't pay a guy like Keyshawn Johnson? Arena Football, the XFL, NFL Europa ... they pay guys beer money. It doesn't sound like the UFL is going to be that kind of venture. And basically, I believe this: doesn't do a lot of dumb things with his money. Billionaires aren't billionaires because they invest haphazardly. And the same is probably doubly true of So I think they've got some things working in their favor. If the UFL offers guaranteed money and it's competitive with what the NFL offers, I don't see why they couldn't land some talent and put a good product on the field. Of course, the other possibility is that this whole thing just turns into the best thing to ever happen to the NFL Players Union. If the UFL develops into something that looks like a real threat, the NFL would probably opt to just rework their collective bargaining agreement to up the pay and keep all decent players in the NFL. They can certainly afford to, but to this point, the NFLPA has failed to give them any reason to do so. If Jerry Porter was a Better Football Player, He Wouldn't Have This Problem ... Raiders wide receiver Jerry Porter wanted to switch numbers. He previously wore 84, and he wanted 81. He asked the league to switch. The league said he could ... for a mere $210,000 As it turns out, if you want to switch numbers, you have to reimburse the team and Reebok for the cash value of the unsold jerseys with your old number on them. Porter's getting jacked here. $210,000? What's that come out to, 105,000 jerseys? When's the last time you saw someone rocking a Jerry Porter jersey? Right now, those things aren't worth the raw fabric of which they are composed. Here's an idea, Jerry: do something to make people want to buy your jersey , and you won't have this problem. Things that would include, I don't know, actually getting on the field, catching passes, and scoring touchdowns. . Honestly, Alex, I didn't think you had this kind of craftiness in you. It's odd that I actually respect for the man on the same day he's on the front of the New York Post with a woman who isn't his wife. That probably says more about me than him. Oh well. Anyway, last night, as A-Rod was on third base, a popup fluttered in the direction of Toronto third baseman Howie Clark. As Clark was about to catch it, Rodriguez yelled. He says he yelled, "Hah!" while others say he yelled, "I got it!" Either way, it worked, and I think it's awesome. Clark dropped the ball. The Jays didn't like it. "The thing about the Yankees, one of the reasons they're so respected, is they do things right. Always have," manager John Gibbons said. "They've got a lot of pride and a lot of class. They play the game hard. "That's not Yankee pride right there," he said. "That's not the way they play. I thought it was bush league." Have you seen the standings, friend? The Yankees bush league. Was it gamesmanship by A-Rod? Yes. Was it devious? Sure. Was it unethical? Maybe. Is Howie Clark a professional who should be aware of where his teammates are and be able to block out distractions around him? Yes. Sorry, Howie. No one likes to be made to look like a chump, and I feel for you, but this is not golf. You are not entitled to silence. . I hate to do it to you, Deron, since you were playing through illness and all, but Tony Parker outscored you by 10, had 3 more assists, and turned it over 2 fewer times. If the Jazz weren't winning the point guard battle, they had no chance. Williams finished with 11 points, 2 assists, and 2 turnovers ... and he couldn't even begin to think about guarding Parker.

Calling Cleveland the worst team San Antonio will have played in the playoffs "by a wide wide margin" is simply ludicrous. I'm curious as to how Utah is better than Cleveland by any margin. Denver???

How is it that the Kobe trade demand was the big news yesterday? His team didn't win. He's part of the team. Notice how he failed to take any responsibility for that loss. Should he not have waited until his sport's biggest event be completed before becoming the media hog? The media's need to jump all over it detracted from far more newsworthy events such as the Spurs winning the Western Conference Championship. What an insult to the Spurs, the Warriors, and their fans. Yesterday, Venus Williams broke the record for the fastest serve by a woman and the Ducks won game 2 of the Stanley Cup. Those acts and other acts of athletic greatness were cast aside because some guy is whining again? Who cares if he wants to be traded? Making his tirade the sporting world's main focus resulted in the teams and individuals deserving of the attention having to take a backseat.

In fact, he didn't even get out of the fifth inning, looking shaky for the second consecutive game. Weaver started the game by getting the first two batters out, but then walked Raul Ibanez and put him on second with a wild pitch, where he was able to come around and score on Jose Guillen's shallow single, giving the Mariners a 1-0 lead. "I think my command just wasn't there," Weaver said. In the bottom of the inning the Angels bats exploded for four runs off of Seattle's young flamethrower, Felix Hernandez. The big blows coming off the bats of Gary Matthews Jr. and Casey Kotchman, who went deep back-to-back, with Matthews' blast accounting for three runs. Usually, giving Weaver four runs is like putting money in the bank, but that was not to be. "Obviously anytime you get a four-spot off of a guy like that, you want to capitalize off of it," said Weaver, annoyed at not getting the job done, but happy that the team won. Kenji Johjima and Adrian Beltre started off the second with singles, quickly putting Weaver in a hole, but he was able to get the next three batters out. When he retired the next three batters in the third it looked as if Weaver was going to pitch one of his regular games. In 27 pervious Major League starts, Weaver was 15-5 with an ERA of 2.86, and only once this season had he surrendered more than three earned runs. "Every pitcher, no matter how good they are, is going to struggle at times," said manager Mike Scioscia. With Hernandez also putting up two scoreless innings, it looked as if the two future stars were in complete command. However, when Weaver went to the mound to start the fourth, the wheels began to come off. Ben Broussard led off with a walk, followed by another Johjima single and a walk to Yuniesky Betancourt to load the bases. Singles by Jose Lopez and Ichiro Suzuki made the score 4-3 before Weaver could retire the side. "He really wasn't getting through his pitches the way he usually does, and I think it affected his command a little," said Scioscia. After Hernandez retired the Angels in order in the fourth, Weaver returned to mound, but didn't fare much better as Broussard hit a two-out double. And after Weaver finally got Johjima out, Beltre doubled home Broussard and scored himself on a single by Betancourt, ending Weaver's night. "I just couldn't make my pitches," Weaver said. The nine hits were the most he has allowed in a game this season and the 4 2/3 innings constituted his second shortest outing. "I was struggling with my fastball command, but my offspeed felt great," Weaver said. And while the outcome was not one of his better efforts, he didn't think he was as bad as the scoreboard indicated. "I put a couple of balls over the plate," he said, adding that "there were a few seeing-eye ground balls, which is unusual for me because I'm not a ground-ball pitcher, and then a few bloopers there at the end." Not the type of outing that Angel fans have become expecting to see from Weaver, and definitely not the marquee matchup that the game had been billed as, as Hernandez also had a tough night. Behind 5-4, Vladimir Guerrero put the Angels back on top in the bottom of the inning with a three-run homer. From that point, behind another strong effort by the bullpen, the Angels held on for the victory. "Everyone kind of built it up," said Weaver of his matchup with Hernandez. "But both clubs came out swinging and obviously both of us didn't go as deep as we would have wanted to." is a contributor to MLB.com.

Early yesterday afternoon, a few of the Pirates' players gathered around the clubhouse's mammoth television, checking out the Milwaukee-Atlanta matinee. Pirates starter Paul Maholm pitched 7 innings last night, giving up four runs on six hits against the Padres.. Click photo for larger image. Pirates Notebook: GM says money will not decide top pick Pirates Q&A with Dejan Kovacevic (RHP Shawn Chacon 1-0, 3.38) vs. San Diego Padres (RHP Greg Maddux 4-3, 4.20), 7:05 p.m., PNC Park. Maddux can still look like Maddux at times, but the Pirates have three players with encouraging histories against him: Freddy Sanchez is 6 for 11, Jason Bay 9 for 24 with two home runs and Jack Wilson 12 for 35. The Pirates are 3-27 when the opponent has more hits. Yes, scoreboard watching in Pittsburgh. And when the Braves pulled ahead, the room roared. "Being in second place feels pretty good," shortstop Jack Wilson said shortly thereafter. "We're here watching the Brewers, the only team ahead of us, and I'm checking out what the Cubs are doing. It's a change. It's the first time I've watched other games with any real enthusiasm, and I've been here seven years." Well, the Pirates remain second in the seedy Central Division for a second day, but Chris Young and the San Diego Padres dumped a bucket of cold water on any warm-and-fuzzy sentiment with a 9-0 annihilation last night at PNC Park. Young pitched seven scoreless innings to outlast a nearly-as-efficient Paul Maholm, Khalil Greene gave him a grand slam of support and, as a whole, the Padres performed very much like the legitimate contender they are. Suffice it to say there are miles to go before being 5 1/2 games behind the Brewers matters much. "It's going to take consistency," first baseman Adam LaRoche said after his 0 for 4 with three strikeouts cooled an 8-for-17 tear. "And that's not just consistency in winning. It's consistent pitching, consistent at-bats, good defense. If we're not doing all of that, we're not going to win a lot of series, and where we are in the standings won't matter much." "Tonight, we got beat. That's a pretty good team over there." Led, on this night, by a pretty good pitcher. Young once again dominated the Pirates, improving to 3-0 with a 0.76 ERA against the team that drafted him in 2000, then traded him for reliever Matt Herges two years later. He held them to four hits, struck out seven, and even his lone walk -- to the Pirates' hottest hitter, Jason Bay, in the seventh inning -- looked deliberate. "It's the third time we've seen Chris Young, and we haven't been able to do much with him," manager Jim Tracy said. "There's something we're obviously not seeing." There might be a reason: Young tends to start off opponents with a low fastball, taking advantage of his 6-foot-10 stature for extra downward plane, as well as a peculiarly late release point. From there, he gradually works up the ladder in the strike zone, going higher and higher with each pitch while staying with the fastball. To the batter, by all accounts, the pitches look the same. And, given that Young seldom tops 90 mph, the temptation often is too great, and the batter hacks underneath. The Pirates discussed all of the above beforehand, to no avail: Young threw 60 of 86 pitches for strikes, including a remarkable 23 that were fouled off. As LaRoche put it, "He's the only guy in the league who can get away with throwing a fastball right down the middle." "There's a deception factor there, for right-handed hitters especially," Tracy said. "We hit two balls on the screws all night." Young, now 6-3 with a 2.42 ERA, shrugged at any suggestion he might have done something special. "My fastball and command are my bread and butter," he said. "And my mechanics are pretty good right now." And his spell on the Pirates? "I'm confident every time I go out there." Maholm nearly was a match for Young, pitching into the eighth inning with San Diego ahead 2-0 on manufactured runs in the third and fifth innings. He got the first two outs of the eighth, too, and had one aboard when Jonah Bayliss replaced him and brought the rout. He issued an intentional walk, then an unintentional one to load the bases, and Greene cleared them with a drive off the top of the center-field wall that made it 7-0. Josh Sharpless gave up two more in the ninth. For Maholm, charged with four runs on six hits in his 7 innings, it was a second consecutive solid showing and another encouraging sign for the Pirates that their rotation could be deeper than just Tom Gorzelanny and Ian Snell this summer. "Paul did fine," Tracy said. "He deserved better than he got." Maholm credited a rediscovered aggressiveness early in counts. "I'm coming hard into the zone early on. If they hit it, they hit it," he said. "You do that early, then expand your strike zone and make them hit your pitch." For the right-handed relievers, though, it was more disappointment, which hardly is a surprise anymore. Salomon Torres and Matt Capps aside, the Pirates have had mostly poor bullpen work from the right side, already having discarded John Wasdin, Marty McLeary and Brian Rogers, as well as losing Shawn Chacon to the rotation. "We obviously didn't pitch very well at all, other than Damaso Marte, after Paul was out," Tracy said, referring to his lone left-handed reliever on the night. The Pirates, shut out for the fifth time, have another tall order tonight in facing Greg Maddux to try to take the series.

Piniella and team executives held a long meeting of their own before Wednesday night's game against Florida. ''Everybody's on the same page,'' Piniella said. ''It has been a little bit frustrating. But everybody's on the same page and we just go forward.'' Going forward may mean settling on a lineup. The Cubs have platoons in centre and right field and at shortstop. ''I've tried my darnedest to play everybody,'' Piniella said. ''It's getting to the point where we're going to have to get really set. I can't do it at every position. .. But just play the people who are getting the job done the best.'' The Cubs had lost seven of nine and were third in the NL Central at 22-28 after Tuesday's 9-4 defeat - certainly not the start they expected after hiring Piniella and committing about US$300 million to lure and retain players in the off-season. They're showing the same fundamental breakdowns that plagued them the past few years under former manager Dusty Baker, and there were several on Tuesday. Piniella bemoaned mistakes on the bases during his pre-game session with reporters, then watched commit two in the second inning. DeRosa got thrown out at third trying to advance from second on a grounder to short, and Barrett got picked off second. On Wednesday, reporters were not allowed into the clubhouse until about 4:15 p.m. - about 45 minutes later than normal - as players tried to figure out how to escape this funk. ''We have too good a team to be in the situation we are,'' first baseman said they're pressing - himself and Lee included. ''We've got to go out there and believe,'' Floyd said. ''If you put pressure on yourself, nothing's going to (go) right.'' Piniella said the idea for the players meeting was Lee's and that the session with management was just something they hold ''about once a month.''

Dodgers 5, Nationals 0 WASHINGTON (AP) -Derek Lowe did a little bit of everything for the Dodgers. Lowe pitched seven scoreless innings, reached base three times and scored a run to help Los Angeles shut out the Washington Nationals for the second straight game, 5-0 on Wednesday night. Lowe (5-5) gave up three hits, struck out five and walked two while allowing only one batter past first base. He combined with relievers Jim Beimel and Rudy Seanez on a four-hitter. ''The final line score looked good, but it was a struggle,'' Lowe said. ''The outs weren't coming easy. Early in the game, the stuff wasn't there, so you kind of have to grind it out.'' Lowe said it took some time to find his stuff, but that he felt more comfortable after the first few innings. He retired nine if a row at one point from the third through the sixth innings. ''As the game went on, it seemed like I got a little bit better,'' Lowe said. ''Today was just a day where I was fortunate to make one good pitch per at-bat.'' Washington manager Manny Acta didn't seem to think Lowe had very much trouble. ''He's pretty tough,'' Acta said. ''He's got to be off his game for you to do any damage and he wasn't.'' Lowe also helped at the plate. He entered the game with a .105 batting average but singled once, walked twice and scored a run, reaching base in all three plate appearances. The Dodgers haven't given Lowe much support at times this season, scoring three runs or less in five of his first 11 starts. But two of Lowe's at-bats led to runs. ''I tell you what, Derek was good at the plate, too,'' Los Angeles manager Grady Little said. ''He had a couple of big walks, a base hit that contributed to some of the run scoring. It was good to see him come away from there with a win. Maybe that will get him off onto a roll.'' Los Angeles opened the three-game series Tuesday with a 10-0 victory and got help from starting pitcher Brad Penny at the plate in that contest. He went 2-for-2, and the Dodger starters are 3-for-3 with two walks and a sacrifice in the first two games. Lowe took care of the first seven innings, and Beimel worked the eighth and Seanez pitched the ninth. Nationals starter Mike Bacsik (1-1) allowed six hits and four runs - two earned - in six innings. The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the fifth. Luis Gonzalez led off with a double and moved up when Russell Martin grounded out. Andre Ethier lined an RBI double and after Lowe walked, Rafael Furcal singled home a run. Martin hit a two-run homer in the sixth for a 4-0 lead. The Dodgers got a break when Nationals shortstop Cristian Guzman misplayed Jeff Kent's one-out grounder, and Martin's two-out homer gave Los Angeles a pair of unearned runs. ''I think pitching has been holding us together this year,'' Martin said. ''(But) hitting's going to come along. We've got some guys that hit for a lot of years, and we've got some young guys who can do it, too.'' Lowe got a one-out walk in the fifth against reliever Ray King and later scored on Nomar Garciaparra's infield single for a 5-0 lead. The Nationals' recent offensive problems continued as they didn't even threaten. They last scored a run in the eighth inning Sunday in a loss in St. Louis. This was the first time the Nationals have been shut out in consecutive games since May 16-17, 2006, against the Chicago Cubs. Notes: Furcal has a 15-game hitting streak, tying his career best. ... Los Angeles improved to a season-best 10 games over .500. ... The Nationals are just 7-18 against teams outside the NL East. They are 14-14 against the NL East.

It was the third consecutive game the Dodger starter didn't allow a run as Randy Wolf, Brad Penny and Lowe have surrendered only 12 hits in 19.1 innings resulting in three winning efforts. The trio has recorded a 4-0 record over their last two starts and have allowed three runs in 39.1 innings. By his own admission he had trouble getting into sync early in the game and although Washington didn't hit him much or score at all, he burned up a hat-full of pitches attempting to find his way back. My line score looked good, but it didn't tell the story," Lowe said after the game. "I was behind in the count early, and you're not going to win many games like that. In the third, fourth and fifth innings, I don't think I threw three breaking balls for strikes." " But when the motor started to smooth out, when his breaking ball started the "falling off the table" mode, it was just a case of how many innings Manager Grady Little would let him go. He picked up 11 ground ball outs and retired 13 of the final 15 he faced, allowing them one hit. The hit, incidentally, came via a very charitable scoring call, the obvious error bouncing out of Tony Abreu's glove, off his chest and into his hands before he made a late throw to first. After his usual early-season shakedown, he seemingly has all the belts and pulleys in working order. Last season he was 7-5, 3.88 before the All-Star break and 11-5, 3.63 after. Lowe has crafted a 2.16 ERA in six May starts, winning in four of them. And oddly enough, he's lost the two complete games he's pitched. Lowe's record is very deceptive. In his five losses, the Dodgers have scored only seven runs and in his five wins, he's allowed only six earned runs. He has eight quality starts in 12 outings and his ERA is down to 3.32. He's allowed only two home runs compared to 14 last year. The offense also seemed to take a while, finally getting on the board with a little help from the Washington infield. An error and doubles by Luis Gonzalez and Andre Ethier, plus 's single, made it 2-0 in the fifth. The hit boosted Furcal to a career-tying 15 straight games. A two-run home run to dead center by (#5) to boost the margin to 4-0 and a Lowe walk, a Furcal double and a Nomar Garciaparra single drove in the final run of the game in the seventh. Joe Beimel allowing the Nationals nothing at all in the eighth and Rudy Seanez gave up a harmless single in the ninth before closing things out. With the win, the Dodgers will win the series for the first in three tries in JFK Stadium, playing their final game tonight with their new stadium scheduled to be ready in 2008. The Dodgers jump a remarkable 10 games above .500 for the first time this season but can't shake either Arizona (- 1/2) or San Diego (-1) in the National League West. Washington can't even retire the Dodger starters. Lowe reached base in all three of his plate appearances on a single and two walks and after Penny's 2-for-2 performance the previous night, they've reached base five straight times. "There's a lot of pressure on Mark tomorrow. Hopefully he can get his first hit of the year," Lowe said, tongue firmly in cheek, of tonight's starter Mark Hendrickson. Mark Hendrickson (2-2) draws the final start of the series tonight.

Lou Piniella didn't need many words to sum up what he saw in the Florida Marlins' 9-4 victory over his slumping Cubs on Tuesday night at Wrigley Field in Chicago. "That might be our worst game of the year," said Piniella. The Cubs have lost seven of their past nine games. Piniella spoke to the media before the game about his team's bad baserunning. Then the Cubs made two blunders on the base paths. Mark DeRosa was thrown out at third base trying to advance from second on a grounder to shortstop, and Michael Barrett was picked off at second &#8212; both in the second inning. "Not a good play," Piniella said on DeRosa's choice to go to third. "Getting picked off second base, not a good play. "We just have to keep playing and turn this thing around," Piniella said. "Nobody is going to feel sorry for us. All these other teams don't [care] if we're struggling or not struggling. "We have to keep working at it &#8212; and we will. The word 'patience' is a beautiful word. You need a lot of patience. The problem is that in this business, patience is [needed] every night." The Cubs are six games below .500, tied for their season worst. LHP Randy Johnson (2-2) will make his first start in 10 days today. The Big Unit missed his last turn with forearm tendinitis. 3B Chipper Jones (sore right hand) won't play until Friday at the earliest, manager Bobby Cox said. OF Ryan Freel was released from a hospital and placed on the 15-day disabled list. OF Dewayne Wise was called up from AAA Louisville. Freel was hurt in an outfield collision Monday. SS Troy Tulowitzki leads major-league rookies in runs, hits and walks. 2B Craig Biggio's 651st double was his 2,973rd career hit. He ranks seventh in career doubles, six behind Nap Lajoie. SS Rafael Furcal extended his hitting streak to 14 games. OF Shawn Green went on the 15-day DL with a broken right foot, the first time he's been on the DL in the major leagues. 1B Ryan Howard, who recently came off the DL, scared Phillies fans when he came up limping and left in the ninth inning against Arizona. It was cramps. "My leg is fine," said last year's NL MVP. Back spasms kept SS David Eckstein out of the lineup for the third straight game. Reliever Kevin Cameron allowed a run to the Pirates, the first he has given up in 17-1/3 career innings. As expected, OF Barry Bonds didn't start. The Giants were off Monday, and manager Bruce Bochy likes the idea of getting Bonds two straight days of rest. 1B Nick Johnson, who had hoped to rejoin the Nationals by June 1, said rehabilitation of his broken right leg is taking longer than he expected and he can't predict when he'll return.

Thursday, May 31, 2007 Letters to the Editor View & Buy Photos Posted: Tuesday, May 29, 2007 - 02:06:28 pm CDT Francis quiets Cardinals as Rockies extend streak to six straight victories Colorado Rockies' Kazuo Matsui (7) covers his head as he beats the throw to St. Louis Cardinals third baseman Scott Spiezio (26) during the fifth inning of a baseball game in Denver on Monday. (AP Photo/Jack Dempsey) DENVER (AP) &#045; Jeff Francis doesn&#039;t want to analyze why he&#039;s pitching so well in May. The Colorado Rockies feel the same way about their six-game winning streak. Francis allowed five hits in 72/3 innings as the Rockies continued on their longest winning streak since 2002 with a 6-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Monday. &#8220I think we&#039;ve always expected this out of ourselves,&#8221; said Francis, who is 3-1 with a 2.23 ERA in May. &#8220Nobody motivates us more than ourselves. We&#039;re not out here winning so they&#039;re not writing bad things about us.&#8221; The Rockies had come under fire before their hot streak. Not that manager Clint Hurdle has paid any attention to the criticism. &#8220I don&#039;t read the papers,&#8221; Hurdle said. &#8220I&#039;ve heard rumblings. But you talk about staying focused on the game at hand.&#8221; Francis (4-4) can&#039;t explain why the Rockies have broken out of their funk, only saying the team has started combining their pitching and hitting. &#8220Since I&#039;ve been here, the biggest problem has been putting it together for a stretch,&#8221; Francis said. &#8220It&#039;s what we&#039;ve expected. We&#039;re not satisfied at six.&#8221; Francis had a shutout going into the eighth when Aaron Miles doubled with two outs and So Taguchi hit a two-run homer to left, his first of the season. It was Francis&#039; only mistake of the game. &#8220He did what he does with pitches like that,&#8221; Francis said. Miles was impressed with his former teammate. &#8220Everybody has the book on him and everybody has the tape,&#8221; Miles said. &#8220When he&#039;s pitching where he wants to, he&#039;s really tough. It&#039;s why he fast-forwarded through the minor leagues &#045; nobody could hit him there. &#8220He had a little bit of trouble in the beginning of his career here, but it looks like he&#039;s settling into a pretty good pitcher.&#8221; Hurdle pulled Francis after Taguchi&#039;s homer, feeling Francis didn&#039;t have anything left, even after only 99 pitches. &#8220I was pretty exhausted,&#8221; said Francis, who threw 14 scoreless innings before Taguchi&#039;s homer. &#8220I could feel the end coming out there.&#8221; Brad Hawpe had a two-run homer in the seventh and Matt Holliday had a solo homer in the first, his ninth. Kaz Matsui scored two runs on two singles and Willy Taveras finished 2-for-4 with two stolen bases. &#8220I think we&#039;re expecting to come up with the big plays in big situations,&#8221; Holliday said. &#8220We&#039;re having fun.&#8221; The Cardinals continue their road woes, having dropped 11 of their last 13 away from Busch Stadium. &#8220This game, we never really got it going,&#8221; Miles said. Francis worked his way out of a two-out jam in the sixth. He gave up singles to Miles and Taguchi and then pitched around Albert Pujols to load the bases. Scott Spiezio hit into an inning-ending force play at second. &#8220We made a lot of outs that were not quality outs,&#8221; manager Tony La Russa said. &#8220That&#039;s how I see today&#039;s game.&#8221; The Rockies see it as another step in the right direction. The team hasn&#039;t won seven games in a row since September 1998. Kip Wells (2-9) gave up 11 hits in 61/3 innings and struck out three. The Cardinals have been outscored 51-15 in his last seven starts. &#8220It was a battle the whole time,&#8221; Wells said of his outing. &#8220Obviously I had men on base pretty much every inning.&#8221; Pujols&#039; 11-game hitting streak was snapped with an 0-for-3 afternoon. Francis sparked a two-run fifth inning with a one-out double to right-center, his first extra base hit since 2005. He scored on Matsui&#039;s RBI single to left. When asked about his speed around third, Francis just rolled his eyes. &#8220Yeah, right,&#8221; he said. As for his recent success on the mound, he doesn&#039;t want to dwell on it. &#8220I&#039;ve always felt like I could go out here and win a ball game,&#8221; Francis said. &#8220Even if I&#039;m in a slump, I have confidence I&#039;m going to come out of it. When I&#039;m pitching well, like now, it&#039;s easy to roll with it.&#8221; Notes: Reliever Manny Corpas left town to attend a funeral in Panama. He&#039;s expected back Wednesday. ... David Eckstein and Scott Rolen got Monday off to heal. Eckstein missed his second straight game with tightness in his back. Rolen suffered a slight concussion Sunday when he collided with Washington&#039;s Dmitri Young at first base. All Contents Copyright &copy; 2007 News Tribune Co. All rights reserved.

You are, after all, the game that means so much to so many. I have to admit, though, it's hard to see you this way, but you don't have any reason to shy off in shame. Yes, ratings are down and people seem to be losing interest in your incarnation as the Western Conference Finals, but they just don't know what they're missing out on. It was another great game on Monday night, a heavyweight battle with both teams delivering their shots and absorbing their opponent's best until the Jazz simply couldn't take anymore. The Spurs stood victorious, winning 91 to 79 and taking a commanding 3 - 1 lead in the series. Keep your chin up, though, because they'll come around to seeing it the way I do eventually. All this means is that people don't really know who you are and maybe they're not sure why they fell in love with you in the first place. Don't believe the critics that say you aren't deep enough because those are the people that have been enticed by the shallow flashiness that too many people exhibit through you. All those attention-grabbing dunks and long-range shots are a part of who you are, but I think we both know that there's so much more to you than that. Just remember that what makes you so beautiful is your complexity combined with your intrinsic ability to synthesize such scrupulous minutiae into the game we see before our eyes. I think I know why people have slipped away from you lately, though. There aren't as many of those superstars that the NBA built itself upon left in your annual tournament and the high-octane, frenetically-paced teams have been eliminated, taking the perceived fun out of the postseason. I can see the distraction of a set of ping pong balls that will shape the future. I understand that star players making demands for change because of their team's elimination is what makes headlines. I can see that the slower pace and more physical nature of the games have a difficult time competing against the knockout right hand from Quinton "Rampage" Jackson. But the same game that people are seeing as "boring" now is the one I've been devoted to since I was eight years old. Beneath all the glitz, glamour, and offensive gimmickry lies a primed surface waiting to be appreciated before being painted upon. It was that plain grey canvas that first fueled my adoration and now holds me tightly bound to you still. It all started with understanding that you were the simplest of games, needing nothing more than a bouncing ball and preferably a pair of rubber-soled high-tops. Those weren't always available, so dudes rocking their Airwalks or church shoes would step to your court because it didn't really matter. It was all about the ball - we didn't need bats or pads or cleats or cups. All we brought to the court was our own skill and desire. Everyone learned to do everything on that court because that's what you demanded of us. You're not like those other games that require players to take up a certain responsibility and stick to that. With you, we had to learn how to pass, shoot, dribble, rebound .. we had to do it all on those blacktops. You forced no one into any kind of chore at that time like football did, where you either pass, throw, carry, or block. Everyone undertook a broad range of tasks, everyone learned the essentials, and everyone had to be respectable in each area to have any success. And as we learned how to play your game, we began to invent. People had always been inventing things throughout the course of human history, either with the purpose of improving an aspect of their lives or just stumbling upon something accidentally that had that same effect. But you were born in an age where invention became rapid because it was a deliberate pursuit, a time when a guy in Massachusetts was bored and wanted to find a way to pass his days. There was a problem and Naismith solved it by inventing you, just as The Wizard of Menlo Park was fulfilling pre-existing needs in New Jersey. Similar to the fashion you were invented with the purpose of improvement, we all used our creativity and imagination to invent the moves and stylistic dribbles that we felt would improve our game. We looked towards our idols on television and replicated their actions while adding our own spin to it, hoping that we'd establish our own signature on the game. We used whatever acrobatic ability we had to figure out how to dupe our defenders and win those meaningless games on the blacktop. Then things changed - suddenly we were playing games on hardwood courts inside of the high school gym on Sunday mornings. Now the disputes that we had about the score were settled quickly by looking at the digital scoreboard. Referees started calling these things called and we had to learn a more organized game with some guy we called Now, more than ever, there was a need for coordination between us and our teammates. You demanded it from us because when we failed to be on the same page as our team, you'd give the win to our opposition and we were forced to bitterly go home, riding in the backseat of our father's car as he tried to cheer us up and we sipped our juiceboxes. Boy, did you teach us the importance of being a team. We had to learn that the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. We realized that to play your game and have the optimal effect of the skills we honed earlier, we had to harmonize our actions like an group does their voices. Coach had to teach us how to work as a unit on the fly because there weren't pauses in the game for us to huddle up and set things up. You became a game of vertical management with our coach at the pinnacle in practice, but horizontal coordination reigned supreme during games when we each served as units working with one another, independent of our superior until time outs and breaks. Those lessons in spontaneous coordination, more commonly known as stick with me today. The chemistry of teamwork is what makes you so damn beautiful and nothing can ever change that. Because you flow like a river - continuously, with no significant stoppages or necessary switches of the field from offense to defense - we were forced to make decisions under pressure and in the moment. Our coaches could call plays all they wanted from the sidelines, but the in-game execution was on us, serving as a manifestation of hours of preparation through drills for skill development. All our coach could do was cultivate an environment that favored what he hoped would become a natural synchronization on our team. Which brings us all the way back to where we are today, watching the conclusion of Game Four between the San Antonio Spurs and Utah Jazz come to an end with Gregg Popovich forced to pry Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili away from reporters as debris rained from the stands. All these two teams have been doing for a week now has been playing fundamental, pure team basketball - artistry in motion in paying tribute to you on the premier hardwood courts of San Antonio and Salt Lake City. Duncan's angled bank shots are brushstroked lines, the utilization of the most fundamental skill in the game, adding only to his greatness with his humility in using them. Pick-and-rolls between Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer exemplify the colorful chemistry you encourage. The plays drawn up by Popovich and Jerry Sloan on those whiteboards during timeouts provide the shape of the offensive and defensive schematics for both teams that foster necessary organization. Tony Parker's fearlessness when driving to the basket, contorting his form in the lack of space between the forest of big men in the paint, epitomize the creativity and athleticism you demand. And lest we forget the sheer physicality that is leaving these competitors bruised and battered, adding texture to their skin in the form of scars, scrapes and cuts; Ginobili looks more like he played a game in Anaheim on Monday night instead of Salt Lake City. I know that it must pain you to see people not responding positively to the way the game is being played by these two teams, especially when you consider that this is the way you want the game played. The Jazz and Spurs have fully embraced their coaches' preaching the " ore" gospel, as so many different players have the ability to contribute to the ultimate goal of winning on any given night. They believe in one another, don't put pressure on themselves, and have each other's back in the same manner as team's of yore. So really, I don't see what's so boring about the product we see on the court. With the synthesis of all that minutiae and what not. I don't have any answers for you or reasons for why it is this way, but I hope you feel better in knowing that at least there are some people out there who still love you for you and not the bastardized version that we're fed all too often. I guess, with things being the way they are right now, people have just forgotten what they should be looking for. I promise I'll do my best to remind them.

They've been ''choking.'' Some admit they might be pressing to try to justify the $300 million expectations created by the Cubs' big-spending winter. So after a game Tuesday night that manager Lou Piniella said ''might be the worst game of the year,'' team leader Derrek Lee scheduled the first players-only meeting of the season for Wednesday afternoon. The 'O' is for offense Why did they need a meeting? ''That's kind of obvious,'' Lee said. It might take a while to find out whether the meeting did any good, especially considering the immediate result was another lopsided loss to the Florida Marlins. ''We just cleared the air and said some things,'' said Cliff Floyd, one of several players who called the meeting constructive. The Cubs have lost four straight, eight of 10 and 14 of their last 20 as they head into a welcome day off today. ''We just need to turn it around. We've got too good of a team,'' Lee said. ''We want to win bad in here. Sometimes you just have to step back and let things happen. Sometimes you can try too hard.'' The Cubs may have hit bottom in that area Tuesday night. Floyd admitted that with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth inning, trailing by five, he swung as hard as he could on every pitch and consequently struck out -- knowing that even with a grand slam, the Cubs still would have trailed. Lee followed with a similar at-bat and strikeout to end the game. With the loss Wednesday, the Cubs sunk to a season-worst seven games under .500. When you look at a record like that, ''You start choking a little bit,'' Floyd said. ''You start not feeling good about yourself. And if we didn't have a good team, I wouldn't even be talking to you all right now. I'd tell you to move on. ''But we've got a good team. We've just got to breathe and let it show and let it go and believe in ourselves when we go out there on the field.'' Aramis Ramirez said some players might be pressing under the weight of the expectations from all the changes and money spent in the offseason. But Mark DeRosa said: ''We knew the expectations coming in from Day 1 of spring training. You could sense the fans want it, the city wants it, the coaches want it -- we want it more than anyone. ''It's just a matter of getting back to playing good, fundamental baseball -- everyone, including myself -- and not doing just juvenile stuff out there.'' He was referring to mental mistakes, especially recently, including his brain-lock play Tuesday in which he was thrown out easily at third base trying to advance on a grounder to short. ''The talent is just overflowing in the clubhouse. It's ridiculous,'' DeRosa said. ''There's no reason this should be going on.'' The worst part might be the one-run losses. The Cubs are a major-league-worst 2-12 in one-run games. ''That starts to eat at you mentally, and guys start trying to do too much,'' DeRosa said. ''We just need to relax and realize the only way we're going to correct this thing is for everyone to come together as a team and relax and just have some fun.'' Whether the meeting suggested some players taking on leadership responsibilities that appeared to be lacking, Ramirez said: ''I don't think you need a leader. You need players to go out there and play the game and have fun and don't worry about a lot of stuff that some people are talking about. We've got the talent. We've just got to get it done.'' What's the likelihood the meeting has an effect? ''I would say they're 50-50 in my experience,'' Lee said. ''So we'll see what happens.''

Marc Iavaroni is now a rival coach in the Western Conference, set to be announced as the newest head coach of the Memphis Grizzlies on Thursday afternoon. As outlines on his bio sheet, Iavaroni just completed for his fifth season for the Suns, including the last three and a half as the lead assistant. Previously, he served as assistant coach/director of player development under Miami President/Head Coach Pat Riley from 1999-02. Iavaroni’s responsibilities consisted of all general duties of an assistant coach plus the direct responsibility of developing Heat players year round. Prior to that, he was an assistant coach under Cleveland Head Coach Mike Fratello for two seasons (1997-99), concentrating his efforts on big man development. Iavaroni, who recently assisted the USA Basketball Men’s Senior National Team in training camp as they prepared for the 2006 FIBA Men’s World Championships in Japan, owes much of his teaching expertise to his 22-year association as a student and instructor under Hall of Fame coach Pete Newell. A seven-year NBA veteran from 1982-1989, Iavaroni played for Philadelphia, San Antonio and Utah. He was a starter as a rookie on the 76ers’ 1983 World Championship team, voted one of the 10 best NBA teams of all-time. In 1984-85, he played for San Antonio and then-head coach Cotton Fitzsimmons before completing his final three seasons with the Jazz, who won the Midwest Division in 1989. Iavaroni concluded his professional career alongside current Suns Head Coach Mike D’Antoni in Milan before retiring in 1991. Iavaroni played professional overseas for five seasons in Italy and Spain, including three seasons after his college career and two seasons following his NBA career. His coaching career began as a graduate assistant coach at his alma mater, University of Virginia, helping the Cavaliers to their first Final Four team in 1981. Following his professional playing career, Iavaroni was an assistant coach at Bowling Green State for two seasons from 1992-94 under Jim Larranaga, who recently took George Mason to the 2006 Final Four. As a collegian, Iavaroni was a four-year starter and finished in 1978 ranked in Virginia’s top 10 in career scoring and rebounding. He gained first team All-Tournament honors on Virginia’s 1976 ACC Tournament championship team, an accomplishment he still considers among his most satisfying playing achievements. Iavaroni has a penchant for defense, especially with regard to big men, a position he played with the Jazz, Suns and Spurs. The move to choose Iavaroni should ease Pau Gasol's trade demands, while also fueling speculation that socks and suits won't be the only luggage Iavaroni takes along. Phoenix Vice President of Basketball Operations David Griffin longs to be an NBA general manager and his name has already been linked with opportunities in Memphis and Seattle, to name a few. Though it might be in Phoenix's best interest to remove one of D'Antoni's hats and give the GM job in Phoenix solely to Griffin, the opportunity to build something out of nothing might hold more appeal than simply keeping tabs and mildly tinkering with a solid roster already in place. Irregardless, Iavaroni has been deserving for quite some time and should make the Grizzlies a much better contender in the long run as long as he can keep the core of Gasol, Rudy Gay and Kyle Lowry together and rely on Jerry West's knowledge in next month's draft to craft a winner. Memphis had the chance to nab the top pick in the draft. Instead, the balls bounced the way of Portland, Seattle and Atlanta instead. Still, Memphis has the No. 4 pick, where they could go big with Chinese center Yi Jianlian (who was in Phoenix for Game Five of the Spurs - Suns playoff series) or replace Stromile Swift with Florida's Joakim Noah or Damon Stoudamire with Mike Conley, Jr. Barring trade, the fourth selection is the only pick Memphis has in the draft, so Iavaroni will be tested early on. Nonetheless, Iavaroni will bring Memphis fans excitement and competition ... something they haven't seen since Hubie Brown left the sideline.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/19-2&fd=R&url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/n/a/2007/05/29/sports/s222211D70.DTL&cid=1116806396&ei=m-xeRubsBY2G0gGY99jYDQ Piniella Fumes After 'Worst' Cubs Loss Piniella Fumes After 'Worst' Cubs Loss Tuesday, May 29, 2007 (05-29) 22:22 PDT Chicago (AP) -- Lou Piniella didn't need too many words to sum up what he saw Tuesday night. Jeremy Hermida hit a tiebreaking three-run homer in the fifth inning and Josh Willingham added a three-run double in the eighth to lead the Florida Marlins to a 9-4 victory over the slumping Chicago Cubs. Derrek Lee hit a solo homer and pinch-hitter Ryan Theriot added a two-run drive in the seventh for the Cubs, who have lost seven of their last nine. "That might be our worst game of the year," said Piniella, who will address the team on Wednesday about its recent poor play. After Piniella addressed the bad baserunning by the Cubs in his pregame meeting with the media, Mark DeRosa got thrown out at third, trying to advance from second on a grounder to shortstop in the second inning and Michael Barrett got picked off at second in the same inning. "Not a good play," Piniella said on DeRosa's choice to go to third. "Getting picked off second base not a good play." Dontrelle Willis (7-3) worked seven innings for Florida, allowing four runs and seven hits. Willis, a former Cubs farmhand, struck out two and walked one. He also was a starter on the 2003 championship team that eliminated the Cubs in the playoffs. "It's turned into a rivalry since 03," Willis said. Chicago led 2-0 after three innings but the Marlins pushed across two in the fourth and three in the fifth. Miguel Olivo drove in Willingham with a sacrifice fly and Willis singled in Hermida in the fourth. Hermida hit a drive to right-center off Jason Marquis in the fifth for his third homer of the season. Chicago loaded the bases with one out in the ninth but Kevin Gregg struck out Cliff Floyd and Lee to earn his sixth save. "We still had a big lead," Gregg said. "Even though they had guys on base they still had to get a couple of more guys across to get in a bad situation. We just shut it down right there and ended the rally." Marquis (5-2) allowed five runs, four earned, and eight hits in five innings to get his first loss since April 10. He had won his last five decisions. "Starting with me, I need to play smarter. It's one thing to play harder, but there is no excuse to play dumber," Barrett said. Lee broke out of a 5-for-31 slump with a drive off Willis in the first inning. It was Lee's fourth homer of the season. He also doubled in Alfonso Soriano in the third inning to make it 2-0. "I thought he (Willis) just made two bad pitches," Marlins manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "Other than that, I think all the hits were ground-ball base hits going through the infield." Notes:@ The Marlins have beat the Cubs six straight times, dating to last season. ... All of Lee's homers this season have come at Wrigley Field. ... Willis allowed his first homer of his career at Wrigley Field in 33 2-3 innings. ... Willis was 2-for-3 with an RBI.

Look for that 95-mph fastball on both sides of the plate, guard against a biting curveball and hope you hit something. There was no mystery last night, either, what with sinkerballer Derek Lowe throwing for the Dodgers, a right-hander whose sole objective is to get hitters to whack the ball into the ground, creating easy out after easy out, a demoralizing proposition for an entire lineup. Washington's Cristian Guzman makes an error on a ball hit by Jeff Kent in the sixth inning. The Dodgers scored two unearned runs in the inning; that's more scoring than the Nationals have done in two games in the series. (Jonathan Newton - The Washington Post) as the Dodgers continue to work over the Nats with a 5-0 win Wednesday night. Pitcher Shawn Hill, already on the DL for his left shoulder, will now need a second opinion on his right elbow. Right-hander Joel Hanrahan of Class AAA Columbus could be called up to start this weekend.

Check back daily and follow the progress of construction on the stadium. Save & Share Article The Nationals' sum total in those two evenings -- nine hits, no runs. Lowe dominated Washington in a 5-0 victory last night, allowing three singles in his seven innings, issuing the Nationals' second consecutive shutout to start a nine-game homestand. So repeat the refrain from 24 hours earlier, and roll out all those cliches. Good pitching beats good hitting, it wasn't our night, yada yada yada. It all resulted in a pair of games in which Penny and Lowe took what had been a rejuvenated Washington offense and flattened it. "You got to beat the best," Manager Manny Acta said. "We can't arrange the starting rotation when we're going to play opposite teams. Obviously, you want to miss both of them. But we didn't, they were on their game, and they beat us." The Nationals put just two men in scoring position in two nights. They are hitting .150 against the Dodgers. Yet they have a simple explanation: The pitchers were better. "We've just gotten beat these last two games," said right fielder Austin Kearns, who joined third baseman Ryan Zimmerman and center fielder Nook Logan in failing to get a hit the first two games of the series. "It's not like we've had our chances to win or anything. We just got beat. They hit better, they pitched better and played defense better. That's all there is to it." So much for an offensive revival, something that was widely hoped for when the Nationals hit .310 in winning five of seven games on their recent road trip. Last night's result followed a 10-0 loss to Penny on Tuesday; it was Washington's worst loss of the year. The last time the Nationals were shut out in consecutive games was last May 16-17, a pair of losses in Chicago against the Cubs. The only time it had happened at RFK since baseball returned here was in August 2005 against St. Louis. How bad have the past two nights been? At the plate, Lowe and Penny combined to go 3 for 3 with two walks, a double and a sacrifice bunt, more production than any of the Nationals' offensive regulars. Losing to those two, the anchors of the Dodgers' stellar staff, carries with it little shame. But what lies ahead makes the losses more daunting. San Diego ace Jake Peavy -- perhaps the National League's best pitcher thus far -- is due to open a three-game series here tomorrow night. Look, too, at the bigger picture in coming weeks. The Nationals travel to Minnesota next weekend, where ace lefty Johan Santana might await. They travel to Baltimore, where Erik Bedard is tough. They travel to Toronto, where Roy Halladay could be in the mix. Detroit and Justin Verlander, Cleveland and C.C. Sabathia, then back to Atlanta with John Smoltz and Tim Hudson. The rotations won't line up so they face all of those guys, but they'll see their share. Think they want to jump on Dodgers lefty Mark Hendrickson today? "We'll strap it on for him," left fielder Ryan Church said. "And then we got Peavy on Friday. But we're not overlooking tomorrow. It's going to be like that for this month. . . . We're going to see some good pitching." For the most part, they got that from their own lefty, Mike Bacsik, last night. The 29-year-old fill-in part for the Nationals' tattered rotation offered another serviceable performance, allowing four runs -- just two earned -- over his six innings. But even Bacsik, watching Lowe from the dugout, got the sense that the slightest error could make the difference. "It's human nature to know that the other team's throwing the ball good, so I got to keep this in reach," Bacsik said. Which he did through five innings, when he allowed a pair of doubles. The second, from right fielder Andre Ethier, put the Dodgers up 1-0. Then, Bacsik's first mistake: With two outs, he fell behind Lowe 3-0, then walked him on five pitches. Rafael Furcal followed with a run-scoring single that made it 2-0. Bacsik's only other mistake came an inning later, and it essentially took the Nationals out of the game. With one out, shortstop Cristian Guzman booted Jeff Kent's grounder. And with two down, Bacsik threw a 1-1 curveball inside to Dodgers catcher Russell Martin. "Pretty good pitch," Bacsik said, yet Martin clubbed it for a two-run homer that made it 4-0. That, then, was more than enough, and the Nationals filtered out of a quiet clubhouse knowing what they had just faced -- and what still lies ahead. "We have to capitalize at some point," Church said. "Good pitching, it's a test to see what you're made of."

Williams had a game-high 27 points. The Spurs beat the Jazz 91-79. (AP Photo/Douglas C. Pizac) By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer SAN ANTONIO May 30, 2007 (AP) The Utah Jazz starting backcourt of Deron Williams and Derek Fisher could miss Game 5 of the Western Conference finals against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night. Williams has a sprained right foot. Fisher was in New York on Wednesday morning while his infant daughter underwent a procedure for a rare eye condition. He was expected to arrive in the afternoon, but any delay could prevent him from making the tip-off. The status of both players will be determined at game time. The likely replacements are Dee Brown, who has played only four minutes this series, and Gordan Giricek. "I can't count on anybody until we get in the building and they put their uniform on," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. "If they can't, then we'll count on someone else. That's the way it's supposed to be." Missing either could be a stiff blow to the Jazz, who were trailing the series 3-1 and facing elimination. Williams is averaging a team-best 29.5 points and 9.3 assists this series. Fisher is averaging only 7.3 points per game and shooting 8-of-29, but he's averaging 38 minutes and is the team's most proven playoff performer. Brown is the third-string point guard, with Williams and Fisher the top two. So Brown would start only if Williams and Fisher are out. If either one is there, Giricek probably would start at shooting guard. Williams arrived at Utah's shoot-around Wednesday morning wearing a large walking boot protecting his injured foot not ankle, as the team reported Tuesday. He declined to be interviewed, except to say, "We'll see," when asked whether he expected to play. Williams also was a game-time decision for Game 4 because of a stomach ailment, but played 38 minutes and scored a team-best 27 points. Fisher's infant daughter Tatum is receiving treatment for her left eye. He left the team in the second round of the playoffs for an operation in New York, then returned to the team during the third quarter of Game 2 of a second-round series against Golden State. His dramatic arrival, and his five points in overtime, helped the Jazz win that game. Jazz's Williams, Fisher May Miss Game 5 Comment on This Story WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts.

http://www.fortwayne.com/mld/newssentinel/17304039.htm&cid News-Sentinel | 05/31/2007 | Cubs stay mum on team&#8217;s plan for lineup Tell us your story ideas Ask the Weather Expert Thursday, May 31, 2007 Posted on Thu, May. 31, 2007 Cubs stay mum on team&#8217;s plan for lineup of the Chicago Tribune CHICAGO &#8212; Two months into the season, Chicago Cubs manager Lou Piniella finally appears ready to go with a set lineup. What that lineup is or how long he will stick with it are questions only Piniella can answer, but after Wednesday night&#8217;s 9-0 loss to Florida, he wasn&#8217;t ready to divulge his master plan. &#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll draw the darn thing out of a hat,&#8221; Piniella said. After being swept by the Marlins, the Cubs dropped seven games below .500. With four straight losses and eight of their last 10, are players waiting for an eruption of Mount Lou? Asked beforehand if some players were playing themselves out of jobs, Piniella gave a cryptic response. &#8220;Look, I&#8217;ve tried &#8230; to play everybody, and give everybody opportunities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting to the point where we&#8217;re going to have to get really, really set.&#8221; Four players who may be getting fewer starts are shortstop Cesar Izturis, who&#8217;s hitting .194 with runners in scoring position, right fielder Matt Murton, who has eight RBIs, catcher Michael Barrett, who has made costly mental mistakes, and Jacque Jones, who has only one home run in 181 at-bats. Piniella said he won&#8217;t platoon certain players depending on whether a right-hander or left-hander is starting. &#8220;We&#8217;ve tried that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll try to get as set as we can, and I might have to tinker, or play different people, at one or two positions. I don&#8217;t know what else we can do We&#8217;re tried just about everything.&#8221; About the Real Cities Network Terms of Use & Privacy Statement

Either way, Charley Rosen says the Lakers have major issues, and they're not Kobe's fault."--> Posted: 15 hours ago The latest bulletin from Laker-Land is that Kobe Bryant wants to be traded &#151; and I, for one, don't blame him. Look at what's happened since Kobe and Shaq teamed up for the Lakers' last championship: Kobe wants out of town Rosen: Blame the Busses Blogjam: What's next for L.A.? Kobe has 'trust issues' Boards: Talk to Lakers fans Kriegel: The Kobe Rules Lakers owner in DUI trouble Shaq was traded because Jerry Buss didn't want to commit to a long-term, hugely expensive contract for an overweight player whose body was breaking down. On one hand, this is totally understandable. On the other hand, being able to compete at a championship level for another few seasons would easily have earned the organization a lot more money than first-round playoffs exits have done. In return for Shaq, the Lakers received Lamar Odom &#151; a notoriously soft player &#151; and a roster full of journeymen. Caron Butler, a semi-useful scorer, was then dealt to Washington for the perpetually disappointing Kwame Brown, who probably has the worst hands of any big man in the league. Phil Jackson was also given the boot, to be replaced by Rudy Tomjanovich, who was in ill-health, as well as being basically incompetent. Instead of going after the likes of Baron Davis and Ron Artest &#151; both of whom were available &#151; the Lakers broke the bank in signing Vladimir Radmanovich and re-signing Brian Cook, a pair of duds. Instead of providing Jackson with a capable point guard, Smush Parker was signed and then retained. So who's to blame for the rapid decline of the once-glorious Lakers' dynasty? 1. Jerry Buss, for giving Kobe and PJ contradictory versions of what the team's long- and short-terms plans were; for being less interested in the ruination of his team that in tooling around town in the company of hopeful starlets one-third his age; for trying to control team expenditures so that his personal life-style could be perpetuated; and, most importantly, for letting his son Jim run the team (into the ground). 2. Jim Buss, for refusing to take a chance on the kind of volatile, yet extremely talented, players that the Lakers sorely needed; for basing his player evaluations strictly on statistics; and for exhibiting stubbornness, arrogance, and the refusal to accept responsibility for his own misguided decisions &#151; characteristic of the most dangerous kind of ignoramuses. 3. Mitch "Cupcake" Kupchak, for being a dim bulb. Given the confusion and routine bungling in the front office, is it indeed possible that bringing Jerry West back to LA could save the franchise? As much as he's reiterated his plans to retire, the 69-year-old West would love to come riding into town as the savior. Equally attractive would be the prospect of being called upon to rectify Jackson's inability to re-lead the team to glory. Rightly or not, West has always been resentful of Jackson's coming to LA. Indeed, when West was still in the saddle and Jackson was unemployed after leaving Chicago, the Official Icon was asked how he'd feel about PJ's coming out of retirement to coach the Lakers. West's petulant response was this: "#%*& Phil Jackson!" Even in his dotage, however, West would be a vast improvement on Kupchak. But only if Jim Buss relinquished control of the roster and of his daddy's check book. And if West did decide to accept the role of savior, how much could he realistically accomplish? Despite his most recent surgery, Odom remains a valuable chip in any possible trades. Andrew Bynum even more so. Because of their inflated salaries and deflated skills, Radmanovich and Cook are impossible to deal. Brown's primary value is his expiring contract. That leaves the free agent market, which means that Buss Senior will have to abandon his monetary constraints and yield to the necessity of literally paying for his most recent sins of commission and omission by pumping up the payroll and suffering the surcharges. Maybe by curtailing his own personal expenditures, Buss will even be encouraged to start acting his age. In any case, there's no quick fix for the Lakers. So why should Kobe be expected to embrace spending what should be the peak years of his career care-taking a massive rebuilding effort? Perhaps the only realistic way out of the Buss mess is to grant Kobe's wishes and trade him for whatever proven All-Stars and on-track hooplings might be available. If Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar could be traded without the sky falling, then so can Kobe Bryant. The kicker here is that both Wilt and Kareem were traded to the Lakers!

STEPHEN DUNN / GETTY IMAGES Gary Matthews Jr. (24) of the Los Angeles Angels is greeted by Casey Kotchman (35) in front of Mariners catcher Kenji Johjima after Matthews hit a three-run home run in the first inning Wednesday. Geoff Baker's Mariners blog Notebook | M's Weaver not going on rehab assignment Talk about the team in Mariners forum ANAHEIM, Calif. &#8212; They fought an uphill battle all night as the opponents' drives kept leaving the park. But the Mariners simply could not avoid being beaten by the best player on the best team in the American League West. Every time Los Angeles Angels slugger Vladimir Guerrero strode to the plate Wednesday night, the runners on base in front of him left Mariners ace Felix Hernandez with no place to hide. And on a night when the Mariners needed their No. 1 starter in top form, the mistake-prone Hernandez reverted to being a 21-year-old with plenty to learn. The third home run yielded by Hernandez, a three-run Guerrero rocket in the sixth, was the difference in an 8-6 loss that erased any ground gained on the Angels in the past week. "We came here with a chance to really get close, but they played better," Mariners designated hitter Jose Vidro said. "It was tough to get those guys in front of Vladimir out." Both teams traded runs after Guerrero's fourth homer against Seattle pitching this season put Los Angeles up 7-5. Angels reliever Dustin Moseley carried the lead through the sixth and seventh &#8212; earning the win &#8212; while Scot Shields tossed a perfect eighth and Francisco Rodriguez a scoreless ninth for his 18th save. The Mariners fell 5-&#189; games behind the Angels because Hernandez served up three home runs after going 31-2/3 innings without allowing any. A pair of back-to-back, first-inning bombs to center &#8212; a three-run shot by Gary Matthews Jr. and a solo blast from Casey Kotchman &#8212; set Seattle on its heels. Then, after the Mariners rallied from 4-1 down to take a 5-4 lead and knock Angels starter Jered Weaver from the game in the fifth, Guerrero delivered the fatal blow. But the man who entered the at-bat hitting .577 off Seattle this season &#8212; with three homers, two doubles and eight runs batted in &#8212; once again had some help. Texas Rangers at Mariners, 7:05 p.m., FSN/KOMO (1000 AM) M's RHP Cha Seung Baek (2-2, 4.60) vs. RHP Vicente Padilla (2-7, 5.77). As they had been all series, the top two hitters in the Angels order, Reggie Willits and Orlando Cabrera, were standing on base. Willits got on three times, while Cabrera reached base the first four times he came up. "You've really got to concentrate there to get those hitters in front of him [Guerrero] out," Vidro said with a sigh. But the Mariners couldn't, and 39,288 fans at Angel Stadium buzzed with anticipation in the sixth. Hernandez could not afford to walk Guerrero intentionally with nobody out, or to nibble and fall behind. Hernandez jumped ahead 1-2 in the count with some nasty sliders. He even appeared to strike Guerrero out on a foul tip that catcher Kenji Johjima couldn't squeeze. But when Hernandez tried to jam Guerrero inside with a 95 mph fastball, it was lined more than 400 feet into the seats in right center. No more hopes of a series victory for the Mariners. No ground gained on a 6-4 trip that ended with Seattle a game worse off in the standings than when it headed to Cleveland last week. "I did what I wanted to do that at-bat," Hernandez said. "I threw that fastball because I wanted to. "He hit it. It was supposed to be a fastball, inside. The ball just got up in the zone and he hit it way back." All the home runs were tape-measure jobs. Matthews had crushed the ball to dead center in the first inning and Kotchman's homer was in the same vicinity. "Everything was up in the innings he got hit," Mariners manager Mike Hargrove said of Hernandez's pitches. "We'll go over it with him, that he's got to stay down." The Mariners will try to remember this trip for the good things. They will think about runners in scoring position driven home, not the eight left on base. About the 23-game hitting streak continued by Ichiro with a run-scoring single in the fourth. Not a fielder's choice grounder to third by Vidro right after, with the bases loaded and one out, to help strand three more runners. They will think about a first three-game series sweep in Kansas City. About taking five of six from the Royals and Devil Rays, then the opener here. Not about losing the final two games to fall to 2-7 against the Angels. "If we'd won tonight, it would have been a great road trip," Hargrove said. "That's what's disappointing. But the fact is, we had a good road trip." Just not good enough to make a difference.

(Adrian Wyld/AP) Yanks snap slide with big win over Jays Tribe pound Dice-K in finale Weaver shaky but Angels rally D-backs sweep behind Johnson Zito dominant as Giants blank Mets A-Rod defends controversial shout Lowe, Dodgers blank Nationals Young brilliant; Greene powers Padres &#149; Strange play in ninth Jays fight back, but can't sweep Yankees Jays notes: Clark makes unlikely return Wells, Rios vying for All-Star attention TORONTO -- Plenty of Blue Jays took the route of "no comment" on Wednesday night when approached about the latest controversy involving Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez. Toronto manager John Gibbons wasn't one of them. Sitting inside his office at Rogers Centre, Gibbons had plenty of kind words for the Yankees organization, but few for A-Rod. After all, a crucial ninth-inning play, in which Rodriguez appeared to confuse Toronto third baseman Howie Clark on a would-be inning-ending fly out, wound up costing the Jays three runs in a 10-5 loss to New York. "One thing you know about the Yankees, one of the reasons they're so respected, is they do things right," Gibbons said. "They always have. They have a lot of pride and a lot of class. They play the game hard. That's not Yankee pride right there. That's not the way they play. I thought it was bush league." The incident took place with two outs in the final inning, when the Jays were behind, 7-5. Yankees catcher Jorge Posada stepped in to face Jays rookie right-hander Brian Wolfe with Rodriguez on first base and Hideki Matsui on second. With the count at 3-2, the runners were in motion when Posada lifted a pitch from the reliever high in the air toward third base. Clark, who was called up from Triple-A Syracuse on Wednesday, camped under the ball, preparing to end the threat. As Rodriguez ran behind Clark on his way to third, he yelled out and the third baseman immediately pulled up, thinking Toronto shortstop John McDonald was calling for the ball. The baseball dropped to the turf, allowing Matsui to score. "I was under the fly ball and I thought I was called off," said the 33-year-old Clark. "It wasn't Johnny Mac. I let it drop. I was under it and I heard a 'Mine' call, so I let it go. "This is my 16th season, granted most of them are in the Minor Leagues, but that's never happened once. It happened tonight." The typically softspoken McDonald barked at Rodriguez, who stood on third base and could be seen occasionally smirking as Gibbons came on to the field to discuss the play with the umpires. After the game, McDonald declined to go into specifics about what took place as Rodriguez ran between he and Clark. "That's not really something I want to comment on," McDonald said. "I think it'd probably be better to look at the video to see, because I'm not exactly sure. You guys can draw the conclusion just from seeing the replay." Television replays, which featured slow-motion close-ups of Rodriguez's face, clearly showed him shouting something out as he ran directly behind Clark. It appeared as though he yelled, "Mine," which is what Clark indicated he heard. Rodriguez had a different version of the story altogether. "I was actually almost past third base [when I yelled]. I was surprised the ball dropped," Rodriguez said. "In a situation like that -- that play happens to me three or four times a week, except it's not at third base -- [it's] over by the dugout, foul territory. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't." Yankees manager Joe Torre added that he wasn't sure if Rodriguez tried to make it sound like he was calling off Clark, or if he simply shouted out as he sprinted toward third base. "I don't know what to feel," Torre said. "It's baseball. It's not like he said, 'I got it.' He didn't say that. He just made a noise. When catchers come over to the opposite dugout, everyone's saying, 'I got it, I got it, I got it.'" Rodriguez even went as far as comparing the play to Toronto second baseman Aaron Hill's successful steal of home during the Jays' 3-2 win Tuesday. "[The intention was] to win a game. We're desperate," Rodriguez said. "[On Tuesday] they made a great play stealing home. They did some great things yesterday, and I tip my cap to them. It's something that'll be unique -- something you don't see every day. Those guys have their opinion and our guys have ours. I'm fine with that." Regardless of what Rodriguez and Torre said, the players inside Toronto's clubhouse weren't happy at all with what took place. Blue Jays third baseman Troy Glaus, who sat out with a sore left hamstring, was quick to say he'd have some choice words for a teammate that pulled the same stunt. "You'd have to," said Glaus, who added that he had never seen a similar incident in his 10 big-league seasons. "You'd have to discuss and talk to him why that's not a good thing -- why that's not appropriate. "Not since I think 'Major League 2,' the movie [have I seen something like that]," he added with a laugh. "I've never heard of someone doing it and I've never seen anybody do it. I've never had it happen to me. It's disappointing. That's not proper." Toronto was especially disappointed because of what happened next. After Posada advanced to second on defensive indifference, Yankees designated hitter Jason Giambi drilled a pitch from Wolfe up the middle for two more New York runs. Essentially, the play turned a two-run deficit into a five-run hole for the Jays. "I don't get angry all that much," McDonald said. "It's unfortunate that us not making that play led to a few more runs and kind of put it out of reach for us in the ninth inning." Rodriguez is no stranger to on-field controversy, either. In Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series against the Red Sox, Rodriguez swatted a ball out of Boston pitcher Bronson Arroyo's glove during a play at first base. Earlier this month, Rodriguez threw a left elbow at Boston's Dustin Pedroia after the second baseman had already relayed a throw during a double play. "Who it is doesn't really matter," Glaus said. "It's just the fact that something like that happened. It's disappointing." Gibbons wasn't sure what the basis of his argument was when he headed onto the field, except to say that he didn't think it was right to do what Rodriguez had done. The baseball rulebook has plenty of guidelines for interference calls, but it doesn't specifically cover any of the verbal variety. "Maybe I'm naive, but I haven't seen that before," Gibbons said. "I don't even know if there's anything you can do -- maybe some kind of interference kind of thing. I don't know what the rulebook says. I've never seen that happen. "The Yankees have always done things right, so that surprised me." is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.

HOUSTON (AP) - Scott Hatteberg hit a solo home run in the eighth inning and Matt Belisle struck out a career-high eight Tuesday night to lead the Cincinnati Reds to a 2-1 victory over Houston, the Astros' ninth consecutive loss. Belisle (5-4) allowed only two hits after Adam Everett's RBI triple that was nearly an inside-the-park homer. Belisle, a native of Austin, Texas, threw 102 pitches in 7 2-3 innings, his longest outing since a complete-game victory over Pittsburgh on April 28. Adam Dunn knocked in a run with a sacrifice fly for the Reds, who won on the road for the third time in their last 12 games away from home. David Weathers got Carlos Lee to ground into a game-ending double play with the bases loaded in the ninth to pick up his 10th save. Jason Jennings gave up three hits with three strikeouts in his first start for Houston since April 8. Jennings was on the disabled list with tendinitis in his right throwing elbow. Chad Qualls (4-2) replaced Brad Lidge to start the seventh and took the loss. The Astros have lost nine in a row for the first time since September 1996. They lost to the Reds for just the third time in 10 meetings. Craig Biggio doubled with two outs in the second and scored the Astros' only run. Everett hit a sinking liner to center and the ball skidded past Norris Hopper when he couldn't make a diving catch. Hopper chased down the ball and hit Brandon Phillips with a relay throw as Everett rounded third. The throw home to Chad Moeller was high, but the catcher swiped the sliding Everett for the out at the plate. Jennings retired nine in a row after giving up three hits and walking two in the first two innings. He struck out Moeller and Belisle to end the fifth and was finished after 79 pitches. Rick White relieved to start the sixth and gave up a double to Hopper and a single to Hatteberg. Left-hander Trever Miller came on and walked Ken Griffey Jr. to load the bases. Lidge, who hadn't pitched since bruising his knee in San Francisco on May 21, replaced Miller and struck out Phillips. Dunn then flew out to deep center to score Hopper and tie it at 1. Belisle retired 11 consecutive Astros, four on strikeouts, after Morgan Ensberg's two-out single in the third. Lee ended the streak in the seventh with a one-out single to left, but Hunter Pence grounded into an inning-ending double play. With one out in the eighth, Hatteberg hammered Qualls' 2-0 pitch into the Astros' bullpen in right center. It was Hatteberg's fifth homer of the season and his second in three days. He hit career homer No. 100 against Pittsburgh on Saturday. Belisle got the first two outs of the eighth and was relieved by left-hander Jon Coutlangus, who struck out Jason Lane. Notes: Hopper led off and started in center field, both effects of his collision with Ryan Freel on Monday. The Reds placed Freel on the 15-day disabled list before the game.

Not Zito, as Giants Blank Mets Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 31, 2007 The guy named Barry stepped into the batter’s box last night, and the booing started almost immediately. The chants came a few seconds later. “Overrated! Overrated!” the crowd screamed. Skip to next paragraph Barton Silverman/The New York Times Barry Zito improved to 5-5. He went seven innings and gave up six hits, a walk, struck out seven and lowered his E.R.A. to 4.21. Keep up with the latest news on the on The Times’s baseball blog. Go to the Bats Blog » Times Topics: The Yankees Times Topics: The Mets Barton Silverman/The New York Times Rich Aurilia was forced out on a ball hit by Barry Bonds in the third. David Wright, who had shifted near second, completed the double play. Sitting on the bench, might have chuckled. However briefly, the fans’ disdain rerouted toward one of his teammates. Barry Zito, the left-hander who spurned the ’ free-agent offer last off-season for $51 million more, a longer contract and the chance to continue living in Northern California, had apparently rankled some folks at Shea Stadium. Then Zito went out and produced a dominant pitching performance — seven scoreless innings in the Giants’ 3-0 victory — which probably bothered them even more. Overrated? Not last night. “Obviously, he was great,” Manager Willie Randolph said after the Mets were shut out for the first time this season. Almost in the next sentence, Randolph said the same thing about his left-handed control specialist, , who remained stuck at 295 career victories. He and Zito shared eerily similar pitching lines: Over seven innings, each threw 122 pitches, 77 for strikes, but the difference came in how they handled runners on base. Zito (5-5) stranded all six base runners, while Glavine, a pitch away from ending the inning each time the Giants scored, allowed them to rally with two outs and no one on base. He allowed two runs in the first and one in the third — Pedro Feliz drove in all three — then, buoyed by an extra day’s rest, stayed in long enough to hope the offense would awaken. It never did. “When their guys are hitting ground balls, I’m doing my job,” said Glavine, who scattered nine hits. “I’m just not getting the results. There’s nothing I can say to make people understand when you go out there, do what you want to do, make the pitches and you don’t get the results. It’s one of the single most frustrating things.” In 12 starts, Glavine has five victories and a 3.44 earned run average. He acknowledged afterward that considering the way he has pitched this season, he might have expected another victory here or there. But, he added, he understands that things have a way of evening out. “Three hundred is so far away right now that it’s not even part of the equation,” Glavine said. Unlike in their last meeting, Glavine kept Bonds in the park, holding him to one hit in four plate appearances. Bonds singled, grounded into a double play, was walked intentionally and grounded out, and his single contributed to the Giants’ two-run first. After falling behind, 1-2, Bengie Molina drew a walk, loading the bases for Feliz, who grounded a two-run single past In all, Glavine needed 30 pitches to set down the Giants, continuing an unsettling trend. He has not pitched a scoreless first inning since May 8, in San Francisco, and he threw more than 29 pitches in the first for the third consecutive start. “More than anything else, it’s a streak of bad luck,” Glavine said. “I’m going to give up runs at some point, they’ve just been coming too soon.” With Zito pitching, any runs were too much. On a glorious 76-degree day, Zito strolled into the Giants’ clubhouse before the game wearing a knit cap and a fleece jacket. The attire had no effect on his mood. Cool, calm and collected as always, Zito won his second start against the Mets this month and, a few players said, looked even better this time around. When he missed, he missed down. He complemented a fastball that did not exceed 87 miles an hour with a slow curve, a slower curve and an even slower curve. Of his seven strikeouts, six came on a curveball, and Mets hitters could not adjust when he jammed them with cutters. “He’s got this late movement,” said , who had one of the Mets’ six hits. The Mets put runners on base in each of the first five innings, including the first two batters in the second, then wasted Paul Lo Duca’s leadoff double (his 1,000th career hit) in the seventh. Zito finished off his evening by striking out pinch-hitter Julio Franco looking at a menacing 66-m.p.h curveball. “It’s always great coming to New York,” said Zito, who, as a member of the , pitched nine times at Yankee Stadium. “You get all these trash-talking fans saying everything they can think of to me in the outfield. That’s what makes this place special.” Asked if heard anything original, Zito said: “Not creative at all. Just blatant expletives at me. That’s all.” Staying true to his pregame promise, Willie Randolph inserted Guillermo Mota, fresh off his 50-game suspension for violating baseball’s policy on performance-enhancing drugs. He received a mixed reaction from the crowd of 41,395, although the fans clapped and welcomed him into the dugout after he pitched an uneventful eighth inning. Mota pitched a perfect ninth, too. “It’s nice to be back,” Mota said. ... On May 17, when Moises Alou was placed on the disabled list with a strained left quadriceps, he vowed to return May 28, the first day he was eligible to come off. That day has come and gone, and Alou said he was frustrated that the injury had taken longer than expected to heal. “I guess what I did was more serious than what we thought,” Alou said. “It’s something that I thought wouldn’t take that long, and I don’t know what set me back.” The earlier projection that Alou could return by the weekend seems a little premature, he said, and a more reasonable guess is that he will be activated toward the middle of next week. Alou was more optimistic about his pending return Sunday in Florida, but he tried running Monday and still felt discomfort.

Send a Letter to the Editor Corporate Photo Sales, Copyright Herald Sun Cartoons & Caricatures Memorabilia & Limited Editions Back Issues & Home Delivery Herald Sun - Sell your car for FREE Place a classified newspaper ad June 01, 2007 12:00am A LINESWOMAN'S error almost led to the unravelling of Lleyton Hewitt last night, before his fighting nature helped rescue his French Open campaign. Hewitt prevailed in five sets, beating 2004 French Open champion, Argentine Gaston Gaudio, 4-6 3-6 6-2 6-4 6-2 in more than 3 1/2 hours. It was another match Hewitt can add to his lengthening list of gritty claycourt performances where he has fought back against adversity. This time the setback came when the first set took an awkward deviation on the strength of a lineswoman's incorrect call. Gaudio was serving at 30-30 in the seventh game when Hewitt's forehand was wrongly called out. The Australian 14th seed had set the point up beautifully, working Gaudio to a section of court where he would be unable to counter Hewitt's return. However the lineswoman called the ball out, giving Gaudio a lucky reprieve. The error cost Hewitt a break point in a match that was waiting for somebody to falter. Chair umpire Pascal Maria did not need to cross the court fuly before he turned and reversed the call, ordering the point to be replayed. On the replayed point, Gaudio struck the net cord but the ball toppled over, giving him game point, which he converted. The frustration of such a missed opportunity temporarily side-tracked Hewitt. Serving in the next game, he fell behind 15-40 before surrendering the game at 30-40 when he found the net to give Gaudio the break. As is his way, Hewitt immediately turned and attended to his racquet strings, bottling the frustration inside. But it certainly affected him. Gaudio held serve to take the set 6-4 and broke Hewitt in the first service game of the second, going on to take the set 6-3. While he appeared no different in manner, Hewitt was obviously still trying to sort out his demons. It was a major turnaround. Both had slugged back and forth early on, feeling their way, and at times Hewitt had threatened to crack as the passionate Gaudio took to screaming at himself, as early as the fourth game. But the frustrations eroded just enough of Hewitt's concentration to open the door for the Argentine. Now a set up and with a break in the second, all the running was with Gaudio. It wasn't until Hewitt broke for the first time in the third game of the third set that his fire returned. While Hewitt suddenly carried himself differently, Gaudio double-faulted four times, failed to reach even a break point and generally walked like a schoolboy kicking stones. By the time the set was over, Hewitt had broken him again, and when Gaudio double-faulted to drop the opening game of the fourth, the door was not only open, Hewitt was leading the band through.

Orlando Cabrera wouldn't let them. Cabrera, who bats in front of Guerrero, went 3-for-4 with a walk, meaning the Mariners didn't have many opportunities to walk Guerrero, a man who pounds Seattle pitching. The Mariners battled back from an early 4-1 deficit to take a 5-4 lead in the fifth, but Felix Hernandez was about to discover the trouble with pitching to Guerrero. Hernandez had no choice once Reggie Willits and Cabrera reached base with none out. And Guerrero had no choice but to hit a three-run homer that was the pivotal blow in the Angels' 8-6 win. Whatever the Angels need against the Mariners, Guerrero gives them "Cabrera was the guy we had to get out, and we didn't," catcher Kenji Johjima said. "Because we didn't get him out, we had to face Guerrero." Guerrero is a good hitter at the worst of times. He's hitting .350 this year. But when you compare that number with what he's doing against Seattle -- 16-for-29, .552 this year -- Guerrero is in a slump against everybody else. "He's the best hitter I've ever faced," Hernandez said after the Mariners completed a 6-4 road trip, leaving them in second place, 5 1/2 games behind the Angels. "But I'm looking forward to seeing him again." The plan coming into the series was to walk Guerrero whenever possible. There were two intentional walks issued Tuesday, but for the most part Cabrera forced Seattle to pitch to Guerrero by collecting eight hits and two walks in 14 trips to the plate during the series. "We kept throwing the ball up and out over the plate to him," manager Mike Hargrove said. "That hurt." It didn't hurt as much as Guerrero's homer. With that one swing, the Angels won two of three from the Mariners instead of losing two of three. It's a two-game swing in the standings; Seattle could have been 3 1/2 games behind. They started the trip five games back. "We went 6-4, so it was a good trip," Hargrove said. "Anytime you go on the road and you win more than you lose, it's a good trip. If we'd won tonight, it would have been a great trip." Hernandez said he felt good going into the game. But he had trouble keeping the ball down in the strike zone, and when he didn't the Angels made him pay. The first indication of trouble was Gary Matthews Jr.'s three-run homer in the first, which was followed by a Casey Kotchman homer for a quick 4-1 Angels lead. The Mariners, who finished with 10 hits, clawed their way back with two runs in the fourth, but they left the bases loaded. They got two more in the fifth to take the lead and another in the sixth after Guerrero's homer, but that was the end of the line. Seattle, which has scored 98 of its 242 runs (40 percent) in the middle three innings, then shut down, getting just one base runner the rest of the night. That was DH Jose Vidro, who walked to open the ninth against closer Frankie Rodriguez. The Mariners brought the tying run to the plate three times, but they may as well have left their bats in the dugout. Rodriguez threw sliders in the dirt to Raul Ibanez, Jose Guillen and Ben Broussard, and all three went down swinging. The Mariners left Southern California disappointed but not distraught. One more win against the Angels would have made this a superb trip. But to win six of 10 in the middle of 23 games without a day off isn't shabby. And, hey, the Mariners are 23-17 against every team not named the Angels, and the Anaheim crew isn't on the schedule again until the final week of July, so the schedule is looking better. Maybe by then the Mariners will have come up with a way to get Guerrero out. Or, at least, shut Cabrera down. It was another nice night (69 degrees) in Southern California. STAR OF THE GAME: SS Orlando Cabrera went 3-for-4 with a walk and was in the middle of every Angels rally, forcing Seattle to pitch to the man who bats behind him, RF Vladimir Guerrero. PLAY OF THE GAME: Guerrero, who already had two singles, unloaded a three-run homer against RHP Felix Hernandez to lift the Angels from a 5-4 deficit to a 7-5 lead they never relinquished. Hernandez hadn't allowed a home run in 31 1/3 innings, but Wednesday the Angels tagged him for three, one each by CF Gary Matthews Jr., 1B Casey Kotchman and Guerrero. Matthews and Guerrero hit three-run shots. Hernandez wasn't at his best, giving up nine hits in six innings. RHP Sean Green let the Angels tack on a run before RHP Brandon Morrow took over. The Mariners came back from Tuesday's five-hit effort with 10 hits and six runs, but that proved insufficient as the Mariners didn't hit a single home run Wednesday against the three by the Angels. Kenji Johjima and 3B Adrian Beltre both had a couple of hits, and CF Ichiro Suzuki (23 games) and SS Yuniesky Betancourt (11 games) stretched out their hitting streaks. CF Matthews made a couple of well-above-average catches in center to keep the Mariners from scoring more than they did in the fourth and fifth. SS Betancourt was caught stealing on a hit-and-run to close out the fifth inning. 7:05 p.m., Safeco Field Add P-I Baseball headlines to Usual suspect does in M's Mariners Notebook: Shoulder improvement a relief for Ibanez Rainiers' Lehr in command Another impressive outing for Haren AL Notes: Twins push back Mauer's return NL Notes: Cardinals' Molina sidelined 4-6 weeks Angels fly by M's Mariners Notebook: M's up in air about whom they'll draft Jones' homers lead Rainiers Beckett picks up where he left off 'Stray-Rod?'

Red Sox Nation was counting on Matsuzaka to trigger a three-game sweep over the visitors from Cleveland. After all, he was the centerpiece of General Manager Theo Epstein's winter shopping spree and came into the game with a 7-2 record. Besides, the Red Sox -- and moreso their fans -- have a certain sense of entitlement: The thinking goes, ``Matsuzaka vs. Paul Byrd? Who are you kidding?'' But things don't always go according to form. It took the Indians the better part of six innings, but in the end, they dismembered Matsuzaka and left town with an 8-4 win. ``I think there was a little something extra for me to stop the slide,'' Byrd said. ``We're in first place, and there's a team one or two games behind us. So it's extra pressure, but that's why I came here.'' The Tribe lost two series on its nine-game trip to Kansas City, Detroit and Boston and still returned home with a 5-4 record, thanks to winning all three from the Tigers. ``These guys really played their tails off the whole trip,'' manager Eric Wedge said. ``We played pretty good baseball, even here. Boston just beat us the first two games.'' Byrd (6-1, 3.57 ERA) stopped the Sox's vaunted lineup cold for six innings, allowing one earned run (two total) and six hits. But in the seventh, he was stung for three consecutive singles and left with the bases loaded and nobody out. But even though the top of the lineup was set to face Byrd's replacement, Tom Mastny, the Sox failed to score. Mastny retired Coco Crisp and Kevin Youkilis, and Aaron Fultz induced David Ortiz to hit a semi line drive to Casey Blake at third. ``I would have liked to get through the seventh to give the bullpen a break,'' Byrd said. ``But it just wasn't in the cards.'' Byrd threw only 77 pitches and ran his string of walkless innings to 43. It helped that he threw first-pitch strikes to 25 of the 27 batters he faced. ``I take a lot of pride in making guys earn they way to first base,'' Byrd said. ``I'm not concerned with a personal streak. ``And the streak might have ended (in the fifth) against David Ortiz. There were two outs, and I threw the first pitch off the plate, but he swung and popped it up. If I had gone 2-and-0, I probably would have walked him.'' For four innings, Matsuzaka almost looked like a $103 million pitcher, the total paid by the Red Sox in salary and compensation to his former team in Japan. But Tribe batsmen saw enough pitches over that span to figure something out. And in the fifth and sixth innings, Matsuzaka looked more like a guy who should be earning the major- league minimum. Even before the Indians struck for their first two runs in the fifth, Matsuzaka got himself into and out of trouble. His most serious jam came in the first inning, when the Tribe loaded the bases (usually a bad sign) with one out, and Trot Nixon bounced into a double play. Matsuzaka's fortunes began to wane in the fifth. Kelly Shoppach kick-started the offense with a one-out single and stopped at third on Grady Sizemore's double. Casey Blake's ground out to short was enough to score Shoppach, and Travis Hafner's double brought Sizemore around. ``Matsuzaka really threw everything from the outset,'' Wedge said. ``We needed to see that. Once we did, we made some adjustments. I'm not going to tell you guys what they were.'' Things went south for Matsuzaka (7-3, 4.83 ERA) in the sixth. Even with a base-running mistake by Josh Barfield, he gave up four runs on five hits in the sixth inning. Included in the barrage were doubles by Nixon and David Dellucci, plus a two-run homer by Sizemore. In the middle of the rally, Barfield singled home Dellucci and advanced to second on Shoppach's second single of the game. But Barfield rounded second, and Manny Ramirez threw him out before he could get back to the bag. Except he didn't. Replays were conclusive in showing that second baseman Dustin Pedroia missed the tag, something that umpire Rick Reed didn't notice. Matsuzaka, who left after Sizemore's homer, was charged with six runs, 12 hits -- including six for extra bases -- and no walks. The 12 hits allowed are a Red Sox season high (Curt Schilling also gave up 12). ``He wasn't locating like he can, like he has, like he will,'' Sox manager Terry Francona said. Shoppach had four hits, including a home run, and Hafner doubled twice and singled, which might be a sign that he is finally emerging from his lengthy slump. According to Shoppach, there was no secret formula to making Matsuzaka a victim. ``We deserve a little credit for hitting a tough pitcher and getting him out of there a little early,'' he said. ``You just put your nose in there and get some hits.''

Unfortunately for the Red Sox, Daisuke Matsuzaka was not the lecturer. stymied the Sox with uncanny command and location while Matsuzaka allowed six runs on a season-high 12 hits and was yanked in the middle of an inning for the first time as a big leaguer as the Indians avoided a sweep by beating the Sox, 8-4, in the finale of a three-game series between the ALâ€™s top two teams in front of another sellout crowd of 37,091. The Sox, who began the day tied with the Indians for second in the AL in runs scored (276), had plenty of opportunities against Byrd, who took the concept of pitching to contact to an impressive extreme. He allowed nine hits and struck out one as the Sox swung and missed at just three of his 77 pitches. But Byrd avoided the big hit as he mixed and matchâ€”he complemented his mid-to-high 80s fastball with a cutter, slider, changeup and curveballâ€”on the corners of the strike zone. He opened the game with nine straight strikes, threw a first-pitch strike to 25 of the 27 batters he faced and went to a three-ball count just once as he extended his streak of innings without a walk to 43. He threw 61 strikes overall. â€œMan, I tell you what: I looked up at one point and I think he had close to 80 percent strikes,â€ said. â€œWe knew coming in heâ€™s not going to walk anybody. He has a lot of deception to his delivery and he threw a ton of strikes. Adding and subtracting, staying out of the middle. That was the kind of pitcher we expected. You have to hit him to beat him. Heâ€™s not going to give you anything.â€ The Sox were 1-for-11 with runners on base in the first six innings against Byrd, who surrendered RBI groundouts to in the second and in the fourth. â€œ[When] he has men in scoring position, he expands the zone just enough [so] that you are so aggressive that he gets you out,â€ said. â€œHeâ€™s a good pitcher.â€ Matsuzaka, meanwhile, worked out of trouble himself by stranding four runners in scoring position through four scoreless innings. But Matsuzaka allowed eight hitsâ€”five for extra basesâ€”to the final 11 batters he faced as the Indians tied the game with two runs in the fifth and surged ahead with four in the sixth. crushed Matsuzakaâ€™s final pitch over the right field fence for a two-run homer. â€œI didnâ€™t think he located his fastball like he has and like you need to against a team like Cleveland, with that lineup,â€ Francona said. â€œLeft a slider over the plate to Sizemore for the home runâ€¦against a lineup like that, if you donâ€™t consistently make pitches, they have that chance to hurt you. Even some of the fastballs [on which] he got outs tonight, e misfired on the other side of the plate and got outs. He wasnâ€™t locating like he can, like he has, like he will.â€ , back in the lineup after missing three games due to sore legs and dehydration, nearly tied the game with one swing of the bat in the seventh. Three consecutive singles in a span of six pitches to open the inning chased Byrd, but on a pop-out to third and struck out the scorching (extended his hitting streak to 22 games with a third-inning single) before left-hander came on to face Ortiz, who fouled off five pitchesâ€”including one he wrapped just right of the Pesky Poleâ€”before he lined out to to end the threat. â€œWe took some good swings, we just werenâ€™t able to really get things going all together at once [against Byrd],â€ Varitek said. â€œAnd then when we did, he was out of the game and they got two big outs right away. David had a heckuva at-bat. Just didnâ€™t come through. [Fultz] made a good pitch.â€ hit his first Fenway Park homer to spark a two-run eighth for the Indians, who racked up a season-high 18 hits. hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the frame for the Sox, whose AL East lead dropped to 10 Â½ gamesâ€”the first time since May 23 their lead has decreased.

As New York's Alex Rodriguez ran past Clark on the basepath, he yelled something that caused Clark to think he was being called off the play by shortstop John McDonald. The ball fell in and a run scored. Blue Jays stats, more Blue Jays 2007 schedule Photo gallery: Spring training Video: Jays fielding drills Shout leads to botched fielding play by Clark May 31, 2007 04:30 AM The Yankees left Toronto as victors. But that might be slim comfort as the team's biggest star heads out with his reputation in tatters after an on-field incident last night everyone connected with the Jays say is a first in their experience. With two out in the ninth and the Yankees on their way to a 10-5 win, Jorge Posada launched a sky-high pop-up. As substitute Jays third baseman Howie Clark settled under the ball, Alex Rodriguez ran past him on the basepath. Video replays clearly showed Rodriguez yelling something that was variously described by Jays on the field at the time as "Mine!" or "I got it!" Clark thought he was being called off by shortstop John McDonald. So he stepped out of the way and it fell in as another run scored. "I was under the fly ball and I thought I was called off ... and I let it drop. I heard a `Mine!' call," Clark said. Rodriguez admitted yelling, but denied calling for the ball. "I just said, `Ha!' ... that's it." Asked if he said, `Mine' or `Got it,' Rodriguez said, "I would never say that, that's not true. Basically guys, I could care less (what the Jays think). They have their opinions and we're looking at not getting swept. It was nothing personal. But I couldn't care less. My (teammates) in here think it's good." Rodriguez, earlier in the day, had to deal with a allegation that he had been spotted at a hotel and a Toronto strip club with a "mystery blonde." Rodriguez is married. After the controversial play, Jays manager John Gibbons stepped on the field to discuss it with the umpires. Distracting a fielder with a shout is a grey area in baseball, a no-no enforced by sportsmanship rather than the rulebook. "One of the reasons (the Yankees) are so respected is they've got a lot of pride, they do things right," Gibbons said, almost sadly. "That's not Yankee pride right there. I thought it was bush league. But it worked." "I don't know how to feel," Yankees manager Joe Torre said. "It's the game of baseball. It's not like he said, `I got it.' He didn't say that. He made a noise." The Yankees superstar seemed unabashed after the play, pushing away third base umpire Chad Fairchild as the official seemed to chide him. Rodriguez stood on third wearing a slight grin. "I don't get angry all that much," McDonald said, clearly biting his lip. "I don't remember a situation like that happening before." The Jays had battled gamely to climb back into the fray after going down five runs in the first. Rookie Jesse Litsch was rocked early and often and Gibbons yanked him after only two-thirds of an inning and five runs.

The United Football League hopes to field teams in eight cities that have no NFL franchises, including Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Mexico City. The founders are counting on fan support and a cable television deal to make the league profitable after five years. Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, already has signed on as team owner, according to a report Wednesday in the New York Times. But taking on the NFL, among the most popular leagues in professional sports and a television ratings juggernaut, is risky. A number of upstarts have tried and failed, such as the XFL, which folded in 2001 after one season, the United States Football League, which finished the last of its three seasons in 1985, and the World Football League, which survived two seasons in the 1970s. "The odds are against any competitive league that goes up against the NFL," said Dan Rascher, associate professor of sports management at the University of San Francisco. "Maybe if they play in the off-season -- there's plenty of football fans who want to see football 12 months a year." Hambrecht and Armstrong were unavailable for comment. The NFL declined a request for an interview. The new league is still in the early planning stages and is without players, coaches or much of an executive staff beyond two dot-com entrepreneurs who previously worked for the National Basketball Association. The likelihood of a UFL team in the Bay Area is remote, given that there already are two established NFL franchises in the area to compete against -- the Oakland Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers. Aside from Cuban, who is known for his bombast and iconoclastic business sense, no other owners are lined up for the league. Boone Pickens, a Texas billionaire, had intended to buy a team but recently pulled out, according to the Times. Owners would pay $30 million for an initial half-interest in a team, and the league would own the other half. Teams later would sell shares to the public in an effort to raise an additional $60 million per franchise. Star players, who demand multi-million-dollar salaries, are not likely to be recruited by the new league. Rather, lower tier players, including those cut from the NFL, will fill the ranks and be paid lower salaries. Rascher supported the new league's strategy to target cities without NFL teams, saying that many large markets with existing stadiums are hungry for football. Keeping ticket prices low may lure fans who are loathe to pay for the NFL's pricier seats. The New York Times first reported about the new league Wednesday. A Hambrecht spokeswoman confirmed that the article was accurate. Hambrecht is the founder and chief executive of WR Hambrecht + Co, an investment bank known for championing initial public offerings that are priced in an auction rather than in back-room deals. He also was a minority investor in the USFL's Oakland Invaders until the league shut. Armstrong is president of Google's advertising sales in North America and recently invested in a professional lacrosse franchise in Boston. Both men have pledged $2 million for the league. In doing so, they join a long list of successful businessmen who have tried their hands at professional sports, including Cuban and Oracle's Larry Ellison, who races yachts. Arena Football is now the only challenger to the NFL, and only to a limited extent. The upstart league, which plays in arenas that have a much smaller capacity than stadiums, fields eight-man teams and hold its season in the spring, so it doesn't compete with the NFL.

He didn't give up any runs at all. Outpitching Kansas City's Gil Meche, Bedard allowed four hits in eight innings Wednesday night and led Baltimore to a 3-0 victory, the fifth straight win for the Orioles and the seventh loss in a row for the hapless Royals. ''It's always tough when it's 0-0 late in the game,'' Bedard said. ''But you just stay in there and battle and good things will happen.'' Winless since April 18, Bedard (4-3) had five strikeouts and two walks in his longest outing of the season. Only one runner got past second against the left-hander. Jay Payton broke up the scoreless duel with an RBI single in the eighth and Nick Markakis, inserted into right field for defensive purposes, hit a two-run homer in the ninth off Zack Greinke. Meche (3-4) bounced back from his worst outing of the year to throw one of his best games since joining Kansas City. ''Gil was terrific,'' said Royals' manager Buddy Bell, who was ejected in the top of the eighth for arguing with Marty Foster after the home plate umpire had thrown out Emil Brown for arguing a called third strike. ''It's hard to win when you don't score any runs,'' Bell said. ''He gave us what we needed, but we couldn't do anything with Bedard.'' After matching Bedard with seven shutout innings, Meche departed when Payton grounded an RBI single through the hole into left with one out in the eighth. The right-hander gave up four hits and one run in 7 1-3 innings. He walked four and had five strikeouts after allowing seven runs and 11 hits in 4 1-3 innings his previous start. ''Coming out of a slump against Bedard is not an easy thing to do,'' Meche said. ''He just beat us.'' Chris Ray pitched a perfect ninth for his 12th save in 15 chances. Rain delayed the game at the start 1 hour, 36 minutes, then the pitchers did their best to get the fans home quickly. The game took 2:31. It had been so long since his last win, Bedard said he couldn't remember when it happened. ''I know it was a long time ago,'' he said. But frustration, he added, is ''part of the game.'' ''It happened the first two years. It happened last year. It happens every year,'' he said. ''You go through a span where you don't win for four or five games in a row, then you win five in a row. It's part of the game.'' Ramon Hernandez walked leading off the eighth for the Orioles, whose five-game winning streak is their longest of the season. Corey Patterson was safe at first when he laid down a bunt and beat the throw to the bag. The runners moved up on Brian Roberts' sacrifice bunt, and then Payton's single broke the scoreless tie. Greinke came in for Meche and struck out the next two batters, Miguel Tejada and Aubrey Huff, on six pitches, but surrendered a single to Kevin Millar ahead of Markakis' home run. Meche's lower back had tightened up in his previous start, rendering him ineffective. But facing a Baltimore lineup which had scored 31 runs and hit .315 while winning four in a row, he was dominant for seven innings. Mora singled leading off the second, then the right-hander retired 16 in a row before walking Roberts to lead off the sixth. The seven-game skid is the longest of the year for the Royals, who again have reclaimed the worst record in the majors. In getting swept three games by the Orioles, the Royals managed only three runs and 12 hits. They now begin a seven-game road trip to Tampa Bay and Cleveland. ''They're all frustrated,'' Bell said of his players. ''And I'm right there with them.'' Notes: Baltimore LHP Jamie Walker was passing out cigars celebrating the birth of his fourth child. He'd been away for two days to be with wife Natalie. ... Bell hadn't been thrown out of a game since April 9 at Toronto.

TIGER'S HAD HIS PHIL OF RIVALRY TALK Subscribe to RSS Feed Click here for all the latest golf scores Click here for European Tour calendar Click here for US Tour calendar Click here for more golf news Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson are both playing the Jack Nicklaus-hosted Memorial tournament in Ohio for the first time since 2002, and although fans will be desperate for the pair to do battle at the top of the leaderboard, Woods has downplayed the duel. Fans and media have long craved a legitimate rivalry between Woods and someone else, and for a while it looked like they had found one, as Mickelson won the 2005 PGA Championship and 2006 Masters. But after 'Lefty' melted on the final hole of the 2006 United States, making double bogey to hand Geoff Ogilvy victory, the rivalry had to be put on hold as Mickelson went into a mini slump. At the recent Players Championship, however, Mickelson was back to his brilliant best, blowing away the field barely a month after starting a swing renovation with new coach Butch Harmon. Whether he has the staying power to become a long-term rival to Woods remains to be seen, and Woods for one appears to have doubts. "Ever since I've been on tour they've been looking for a rivalry for me. I've had guys make different runs," said Woods, reeling off names such as David Duval, Ernie Els, Vijay Singh and Retief Goosen. Woods noted that Nicklaus had rivalries during his career with the likes of Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Tom Weiskopf and Johnny Miller, but noted that true rivalries are sustained by long-term excellence. "You've got to do it a number of times to get that reputation," he said. "Watson and Trevino (beat) Jack, but they didn't do it one time, they did it a number of times. Repeatability is the key. You can't just do it once." Mickelson, for his part, was not interested in talking rivalry with Woods, no doubt aware that it does not pay to give the man any extra motivation. "It's flattering, to me anyway (but) probably not to him," Mickelson quipped. "I mean we're talking about probably the best player of all time." That said, Mickelson thinks there is plenty of room for improvement as he continues to refine his swing with Harmon. "We're probably halfway through," he said. "We have one or two more things I want to implement, but it's just taking a little bit of time to feel comfortable, especially in competition." Woods and Mickelson will play the Memorial with one eye on the United States Open, to be played in two weeks at Oakmont. They are both resuming from a fortnight off, but whereas Mickelson practised hard, Woods hardly touched a club, due to a myriad of sponsor commitments. Instead, he focused on his fitness regiment, confident there is plenty of time to get his swing back in the groove before the year's second major. "You've got to pick one or the other, and I picked getting my body in shape for the run to the U.S. Open," said Woods, who will take next week off to focus on his game."

Buy and sell tickets to premium and sold out events Search by events or regions: Looking to sell tickets quick? Byrd's pinpoint control helps Tribe win By Howard Ulman, AP Sports Writer BOSTON &#151; Even the most selective team in the league couldn't coax a walk out of Paul Byrd. Putting his pitches where he wanted, Byrd extended his walkless streak to 43 innings and threw first-pitch strikes to 25 of 27 hitters as the Cleveland Indians beat the Boston Red Sox 8-4 Wednesday night. "I don't know that I take pride in a walk streak. I take a lot of pride in making them earn their way to first base," he said. The loss snapped a five-game winning streak for Boston (36-16), which has the best record in the majors. Cleveland (32-19), with the AL's second best record, overcame a 2-0 deficit after four innings and avoided being swept in the three-game series. Byrd (6-1), who won his fifth straight decision, issued his last walk more than a month ago -- to Kenny Lofton of Texas on April 26 -- and has gone six games without throwing four balls on any at batter. The only Cleveland pitcher in the last 50 years with a longer streak than 43 innings is Dick Donovan, who went 45 1-3 in 1963. In 58 innings this year, Byrd has walked just three. Stopping the Red Sox from walking is impressive, considering they lead the league with 221. Cleveland catcher Kelly Shoppach said Byrd's ability to throw pitches close to the plate, but not down the middle, entices opponents to swing. "They may not get the pitches they want to hit. That's why they take them," Shoppach said. "As a pitcher and catcher, we want to attack them. We want them to swing the bat." Shoppach was the most productive swinger with a career-high four hits, including a solo homer in the eighth. The former Boston farmhand led Cleveland's season-high 18-hit attack. Daisuke Matsuzaka (7-3) allowed 12 in 5 2-3 innings. "Not only my fastball, but, overall, I think I had problems with my control," he said. Matsuzaka didn't walk anyone but left more pitches over the plate than Byrd. And he didn't get his usual support. In his previous 10 starts, the Red Sox scored 63 runs for him. But they hadn't faced Byrd yet. "We knew coming in he is not going to walk anybody," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "You have to hit him to beat him." Trailing 2-0, Byrd shut down Boston until Cleveland tied the game in the fifth and went ahead 6-2 in the sixth. "He's aggressive," Shoppach said. "If they're not knocking him all over the place, they're not giving us a reason to change our game plan." Matsuzaka had won his previous six decisions but was driven from the game in the sixth when he allowed four runs despite getting help from a poor call by second base umpire Rick Reed. Former Boston right fielder Trot Nixon led off with a double and scored the tie-breaking run on David Dellucci's double. Josh Barfield singled to left, scoring Dellucci. Shoppach then singled Barfield to second. But Barfield rounded the base and was called out trying to get back when left fielder Manny Ramirez threw behind him to Dustin Pedroia, who swiped at the runner. Barfield and manager Eric Wedge argued and replays showed Pedroia missed Barfield by a wide margin. Two pitches later, Grady Sizemore hit his ninth homer, giving Cleveland a 6-2 lead and bringing Kyle Snyder in for Matsuzaka. "I don't know if he struggled as much as they hit him," Boston catcher Jason Varitek said. "They were able to get one pitch each at-bat." Kevin Youkilis extended his hitting streak to a career-best 22 games, but his stretch of multihit games ended at nine. He made a costly out in the seventh when the Red Sox loaded the bases with no outs on three singles that knocked Byrd out of the game. Youkilis struck out for the second out before David Ortiz lined the ball just foul past the right field pole then was retired on a soft liner. Mike Lowell added a two-run homer, his 10th, in the eighth. Boston had taken a 2-0 lead on RBI grounders by Varitek in the second and J.D. Drew in the fourth. Cleveland tied it in the fifth on a single by Shoppach, a double by Sizemore, a run-scoring groundout by Casey Blake and an RBI double by Travis Hafner. Notes:@ Ramirez turned 35 years old on Wednesday. ... Cleveland starters have walked fewer than three batters in the last 16 games ... Lowell extended his home hitting streak to 22 games. ...

NEW YORK - Barry Zito was the highest profile free agent pitcher on the market this winter, the New York Mets had a glaring need in their rotation, and their fans are used to getting spendy gifts at Christmas. Maybe that's why Mets fans showered Zito with colorful language while the Giants left-hander warmed up in the Shea Stadium bullpen Wednesday night. "It's always great coming to New York," Zito said. "You get all those trash talkers saying everything they can think of. That's what makes this place special." Zito showed them what they're missing. He held the high-powered Mets lineup scoreless over seven innings and struck out a season-high seven batters in a 3-0 victory at Flushing Meadows. The Mets hadn't been shut out this season. It was an important bounce-back victory for the Giants, who lost in 12 innings Tuesday night when Armando Benitez had a balk-a-thon on the mound. Brad Hennessey became the closer Wednesday because Benitez had an inflamed right knee. It was an important prove-it start for Zito, especially after anonymous Mets officials chirped about his tame fastball and decried the &#36;126 million the Giants showered upon him. "You know, I don't really want to pitch with any kind of vendetta against people," Zito said. "For me, it's just about being aggressive, throwing strikes and hoping for the best." Zito's 84 mph fastball worked just fine because he spotted it on the corners and dropped in both varieties of his breaking ball for strikes. He walked only one batter and he gave the Giants innings on a day they needed to go light on their bullpen. Since walking seven in his May 18 loss at Oakland, Zito is 2-0 and has issued just three walks over 14 innings. "A lot was said about him pitching here, but we needed it," Giants Manager Bruce Bochy said. "He can pitch. He'll throw a lot of great back-to-back games. That's why we got him. He showed what he's about tonight." Zito had a good support network behind him. Pedro Feliz hit a two-out, two-run single off Tom Glavine in the first inning and lined an RBI triple in the third. Bengie Molina worked an eight-pitch walk in the first to extend the rally; Molina also singled on a lengthy at-bat ahead of Feliz's triple. Shortstop Omar Vizquel was 0 for 4 but contributed an assortment of highlight plays, including bare-handed pickups to throw out Endy Chavez in the first and Damion Easley in the fourth. And Rich Aurilia broke out of a 5-for-51 slump by tying his career high with four hits. Aurilia, whose stiff neck is coming around, said he made adjustments after teammates noticed a flaw in his approach. Barry Bonds singled and scored in the first inning but otherwise had a quiet 1-for-3 night with an intentional walk. Bonds was just as nondescript before the game, when he relented to the New York media throng and repeated his non-thoughts on the home run record, Bud Selig and Hank Aaron. After the game, the cameras and reporters awaited the other Barry. New York might be special, but it's not easy being a visible baseball star here. You needed only to look at the cover of Wednesday's New York Post, which splashed photos of Yankees star Alex Rodriguez getting into a hotel elevator with a blond woman who wasn't his wife. The headlines were "Stray-Rod" and "A-Rod's A Yankee Doodle Randy." The fans in the outfield at Shea weren't nearly as clever. "Nah, not creative at all," Zito said. "Just blatant expletives right at me." Contact Andrew Baggarly at abaggarly@mercurynews.com The Mercury News is pleased to let readers post comments about an article at the end of the article.

The league -- to be named the United Football League -- already boasts billionaire Mark Cuban, who owns the National Basketball Association's Dallas team, among its owners, the paper said. Hambrecht, Google and Cuban were not immediately available to comment. The plan is for eight teams to begin preseason games in August 2008, according to the paper. The UFL would be the latest in a series of leagues to compete with the NFL since the 1970s, including the World Football League, the United States Football League and most recently the XFL -- all of which failed. An NFL spokesman declined to comment. David Carter, executive director of the USC Sports Business Institute said the effort should not be dismissed, but it will be an uphill battle to establish the new league. "The NFL is clearly so very powerful that they've done a fantastic job of being able to fend off upstart leagues by ensuring that there are never enough open or underserviced markets available to make a start-up league successful," he said. "On the surface, if history tells us anything, it can't possibly work," Carter added. "But -- this is going to sound like Yogi Berra -- history was a long time ago and now the landscape has changed. The right people properly capitalized should never be taken for granted." Success for the UFL may not mean long-term existence as a league, but a place for some of its teams as expansion members in the NFL, Carter said. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Hewitt climbs off the canvas again Back from the red &#133; Lleyton Hewitt celebrates after his gritty come-from-behind win against Gaston Gaudio at Roland Garros. PARIS: A trademark Lleyton Hewitt fightback put the Australian into the third round of the French Open with victory over 2004 champion Gaston Gaudio. No.14 seed Hewitt relishes a dogfight and he got just that on Thursday, heaving himself up from two-sets-to-love down to beat the Argentine 4-6, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 in three hours and 28 minutes. He next meets Finnish No.20 seed Jarkko Nieminen, who beat Frenchman Mathieu Montcourt in straight sets. Hewitt had looked down for the count after Gaudio established his dominance early in the match. The world No.72 converted the second of two break points in the ninth game of the first set to take a 5-4 lead and claimed the opener on his own serve with a smash. Gaudio kept the momentum, breaking Hewitt in the opening game of the second set when the Australian hit a backhand wide, charging on to eventually take a two-sets-to-love lead. Hewitt then dragged himself back into the match in the third game of the third set when Gaudio handed him a break with a double fault. It was all he needed to spark a remarkable resurgence. The 26-year-old baseliner went on to convert the second of two break points against Gaudio in the seventh game with a sharp return and Hewitt closed out the set with a backhand that shot past his opponent. Two double faults by Gaudio in the opening game of the fourth set gave Hewitt an early break. Hewitt's famed calls of "C'mon!" had barely been audible to that point, but when he saved break point in the second game, the volume increased markedly. He sent down a 205kmh bullet for set point and levelled at two sets all with a forehand down the line. Hewitt broke Gaudio in the opening game of the decider when the former world No.5 sent a backhand long and the Australian won his next service game to love with an ace. Hewitt broke Gaudio again in the fifth game and again won his service game to love before serving for the match. He brought up three match points with an ace and converted the first when Gaudio sent a forehand long. In other second-round matches No.16 seed Marcos Baghdatis beat Kristian Pless 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 while 20-year-old Serbian prodigy Novak Djokovic, the No.6 seed, beat Laurent Recouderc 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1. Meanwhile, top seed Roger Federer was furious with French Open officials who scheduled his second-round match to start and finish in the murky Paris gloom. The world No.1, who needs a Roland Garros title to complete the set of grand slams, rounded off his 6-1, 6-2, 7-6 (10-8) victory over French wildcard Thierry Ascione just before 9.15pm local time on Wednesday with Court Suzanne Lenglen in near-darkness. "When we shook hands, I told him I couldn't see him anymore it was so dark," Federer said. "The conditions were shocking. I know they want to get the matches over and done with, but what I don't like is that they know I'm the favourite and they think I should win in straight sets. 'Let's get Roger's match over and done with, then he's happy, he has a day off'. But what if it doesn't turn out this way? I would be very upset. I already wasn't happy playing so late. "I hate playing into dawn. I can hardly see the ball. You start stressing out. I can't believe other players were still playing after me because it was so dark." Federer was referring to France's Edouard Roger-Vasselin's five-set win over Radek Stepanek, which didn't finish until 9:30pm. The Swiss star said the situation reminded him of his heartbreaking semi-final defeat to Rafael Nadal in 2005, which was played in similar dismal conditions. On that occasion, Federer wanted the match called off for the day. "I wanted to stop that match, but there was pressure from the crowd, from television, from my opponent - and if you don't agree with your opponent, you're stupid." At one stage on Wednesday, Federer looked as if he would have the match wrapped up quickly as he raced to a two-set lead inside 48 minutes as the world No.168 was outclassed. But Federer wasted two match points in the ninth game of the third set and three more in the subsequent tie-breaker before he managed to move into the third round, where he faces Italy's Potito Starace. Federer, attempting to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 - and just the third man in history - to hold all four grand slam titles at the same time, was playing for the third day in a row after rain forced his first-round victory over America's Michael Russell to start on Monday and finish on Tuesday. But he showed no signs of fatigue, closing out the first set in 22 minutes, allowing Ascione just four points on his serve. send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today Hewitt climbs off the canvas again Back from the red &#133; Lleyton Hewitt celebrates after his gritty come-from-behind win against Gaston Gaudio at Roland Garros.

(Gettyimages.com) The startling trade demand of arguably the NBAâ€™s best player looks to be the sensation of this summer in the world of US sports. This we did not foresee. The NBA&rsquo;s best player, in his prime, asking for a trade. The greats before him (Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson) all stayed with one team through their whole career, or at least through their most productive years. The closest thing we&rsquo;ve had in the recent past is Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal&rsquo;s two moving projects, yet both times the move was not all that unexpected. Shaq was alienated by the fans and team management in Orlando. In some strange way, he always was only second after Penny Hardaway. Thus his move to Los Angeles was seen as a must. His way out of LA was a minor shock, but considering the fact that he was starting to show wear and tear L.A.&rsquo;s move was seen as being at least some parts right. It&rsquo;s ironic that Kobe&rsquo;s trade demand has quite a lot to do with how the organization (mis)handled the Shaq trade. The possible impact of this is unfathomable. I&rsquo;m pretty much 100% sure that every single team&rsquo;s management is holding extra meetings, working the phones, trying to find a scenario where they would get Kobe. With that in mind I have tried to get the most realistic trade possibility for each team. Here are the results: Josh Childress, Marvin Williams, Joe Johnson and this year&rsquo;s No. 3 draft pick for Kobe and Ronnie Turiaf Why it could happen: The Lakers would get exactly what they would most covet for Bryant - a host of young, extremely talented, players and a high draft pick. An extra plus goes to the fact that the Hawks are in the Eastern Conference, far-far away from Los Angeles. The league office would also love this move, as it would energize a Hawks franchise that has been in lethargy for many years. Why it won&rsquo;t happen: Kobe can nix any deal and he knows he can do better than a team featuring Josh Smith and a bunch of unknowns. Gerald Green, Sebastian Telfair, Brian Scalabrine, Theo Ratliff and many first round draft picks for Kobe and Ronnie Tuiaf Why it could happen: The Lakers could pair up fellow draftees Green and Andrew Bynum plus Ratliff would mean tremendous cap relief after next season. Add in a No. 5 pick from this season and a bunch of future No. 1s and it helps ease the pain that the loss of Bryant would mean. Meanwhile Boston would become an immediate contender with the duo of Paul Pierce and Kobe. Bryant would also be moving from one historical team to the next. Why it won&rsquo;t happen: You think the Lakers would aid arch nemesis Boston in getting back into the upper echelon of the NBA? Fat chance of that ever happening, although it is still better than sending Bryant to their crosstown rivals. Brevin Knight, Sean May, Derek Anderson, Gerald Wallace for Kobe Why it could happen: It is an enticing package of players who fit into the triangle offense orchestrated by Phil Jackson and a player that is fast becoming a dominant force. Wallace is the type of energy guy who would become a fan favorite in La-La land. Meanwhile Kobe would anchor a talented young team with Emeka Okafor, Raymond Felton and Adam Morisson. Why it won&rsquo;t happen: The Lakers will probably not settle for such a package whilst I can not see how the Bobcats would give up any more than that. : Chris Duhon, Ben Gordon, Andres Nocioni and New York&rsquo;s first round pick for Kobe and Jordan Farmar Why it could happen: The Lakers get key pieces for a running team, a top ten pick and they send Kobe to the Eastern Conference. The Bulls get Kobe &ndash; isn&rsquo;t that enough? In the East whoever gets Bryant instantly becomes a beast, at least that is what Chicago would hope for with such a trade. Why it won&rsquo;t happen: Chicago could become the winner of the Bryant sweepstakes, but it would probably take the inclusion of Luol Deng. It might be too steep a price but Chicago seems determined to win now, and Kobe could help them immensely. : Larry Hughes, Shannon Brown, Drew Gooden, Daniel Gibson multiple draft picks for Kobe and Vladimir Radmanovic Why it could happen : Just imagine Kobe and LeBron James playing alongside each other. A dream come true, right? All the while the Lakers get useful players, possible cap relief and draft picks, plus they get to unload Vlad-Rad&rsquo;s dreadful contract. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : The Lakers certainly can get better offers than what the Cavs can offer. : Jason Terry, Jerry Stackhouse, Devin Harris, draft picks for Kobe and Smush Parker or Jordan Farmar. Why it could happen : The Mavs have enough valuable pieces to make this deal work. After a first round exit in this year&rsquo;s post season they certainly have to consider trades, even if they did win a record number of games. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : For Dallas to remain at the top of this strong Western Conference they should keep energetic Josh Howard and superstar Dirk Nowitzki. I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Lakers would want one of the two especially since they are keeping Kobe in their conference with such a move. : Allen Iverson, Nene, J.R. Smith for Kobe Bryant and Kwame Brown. Why it could happen : The Lakers manage to move Kwame&rsquo;s scary contract. They also get a dominant scorer and a strong post player for Bryant. Denver would pair Carmelo Anthony with Kobe. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Denver is in the west. A.I. is aging. Otherwise this is seemingly a solid move. Richard Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince, Nazr Mohammed for Kobe and Radmanovic. Why it could happen: Radmanovic&rsquo;s contract gets unloaded. Hamilton and Prince combined would provide the same amount of defense and offense that Kobe would. The Pistons need to re-sign Chauncey Billups. Together with Rasheed Wallace and Kobe they would be the best threesome in the league. Oh, and Detroit would finally get that true go-to guy they&rsquo;ve been lacking. Why it won&rsquo;t happen: If the Pistons win the title, they will not be aggressive enough with trade offers. If they fail at any point in the play-offs then something might just get done. : Stephen Jackson, Patrick O&rsquo;Bryant, Baron Davis for Kobe and Radmanovic. Why it could happen : Bad contract being unloaded. Baron is probably the closest to Kobe as far as willing a hopeless team to win. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Kobe will nix this if Baron is moved. The Warriors can&rsquo;t offer much else to make the numbers work. : Tracy McGrady and a first round pick for Kobe. Why it could happen : The only feasible straight up trade scenario. T-Mac gets almost as much hype as Kobe and he is close to reaching that upper echelon Kobe already has. Meanwhile Bryant is not only an upgrade for the Rockets, but he is far less injury prone than T-Mac. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : It is too logical for both teams, although I would love to see what Phil Jackson could add to T-Mac&rsquo;s game. : Danny Granger, Mike Dunleavy, Troy Murphy, Jamal Tinsley for Kobe, Brian Cook and Maurice Evans. Why it could happen : Kobe would love to team up with his friend, Jermaine O&rsquo;Neil. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : The Pacers do not have enough to make this work. : Tim Thomas, Sam Cassell, Corey Magette and draft picks for Kobe. Why it could happen : This trade would make sense. The Lakers get cap relief, a solid bench contributor and a talented youngster. The Clippers get Kobe. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Never in a million years would the Lakers help the Clippers! : Rudy Gay, Stromile Swift, Dahntay Jones, Mike Miller and this year&rsquo;s no 4 pick for Kobe and Maurice Evans. Why it could happen : A last favour for Jerry West? Why it won&rsquo;t happen : The Grizzlies do not have enough pieces. Include Gasol and Kobe will not be willing to go there, exclude him and the Lakers want no part of the deal. : Half the roster (mostly Posey, Jason Williams, Antoine Walker) for Kobe and parts to make salaries match. Why it could happen : Beats me. The Lakers would probably help Miami to another title with any such move. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Shaq and Wade are off the table, and the Lakers do not need the has-beens Miami has to offer. Michael Redd, Ruben Patterson and first round pick for Kobe. Why it could happen : In essence you switch Redd for Kobe as far as Milwaukee is concerned. As for the Lakers they get good defense from Patterson, masterful shooting from Redd and a high draft pick. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Redd could team with Bynum in another system, but with the triangle in place, they lack the passing skills necessary. : Randy Foye, Rashad McCants, Ricky Davis, Justin Reed, Mike James and draft picks for Kobe, Why it could happen : The Lakers would get half a team for Kobe, which seems about right. Davis&rsquo; contract means cap relief next summer whilst Foye and McCants are young and talented. Kobe would team with Kevin Garnett to create the top duo in the NBA. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : It still does not seem like fair value for Kobe. Neither Foye nor McCants are set to become superstars so there isn&rsquo;t enough upside to make this work. : Richard Jefferson, Jason Collins, Marcus Williams and draft picks for Kobe and Jordan Farmar. Why it could happen: Williams has been learning from Jason Kidd and he seems like a very good future starter. Jefferson is the youngest of the Nets&rsquo; big three, Collins brings hard nosed defense to a team severely needing it. I don&rsquo;t think I need to explain just how great a Kobe, Vince Carter, Jason Kidd trio could be. Why it won&rsquo;t happen: Carter cannot be included because he can nix any deal and he certainly will not approve moving to a Lakers team with less talent than his worst Raptors teams. The trade stated here works under the cap rules, but is it enough to entice the Lakers? : Stephon Marbury, Channing Frye, Renaldo Balkman and draft picks for Kobe and Radmanovic. Why it could happen : The Knicks are always in win-now mode, meaning they would send every first round pick they have until 2020 to get Bryant if that is what it takes. This package has star power and young talent plus as many draft picks as the Lakers want. With Kobe, Eddy Curry and David Lee the Knicks would be huge contenders to represent the East in the finals. Why it won&rsquo;t happen: We are talking about Isiah Thomas the GM, not Isiah Thomas the coach &ndash; enough said! Peja Stojakovic, Desmond Mason, draft picks for Kobe. Why it could happen : Everyone wans to help New Orleans in their first full season back home, why shouldn&rsquo;t the Lakers be in a giving mood. Just imagine Chris Paul dishing to Kobe. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : It would take the inclusion of David West and/or Chris Paul to make this deal work. There&rsquo;s no way the Hornets should give up that much for anybody. : Darko Milicic, Grant Hill, JJ Redick, draft picks for Kobe. Why it could happen : Hill is a short term fix, Milicic is a work in progress, but the chance of pairing him with Bynum could be enticing. Dwight Howard with Kobe? Dreamy! Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Hill would never agree to this sign and trade. He&rsquo;ll either retire or go to a contender. The Lakers will not be contending sans Kobe. : Andre Miller, Kyle Korver, Joe Smith, draft picks for Kobe. Why it could happen : Miller has played hard wherever he was. He also is capable of making a team overachieve. Allen Iverson never managed to get it going with Andre Iguodala, Kobe could however be the Jordan to his Pippen. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : If this goes to a bidding war Philly do not have enough pieces, but they do have the advantage of being Kobe&rsquo;s home town. : Shawn Marion, Boris Diaw, Marcus Banks for Kobe and Ronnie Turiaf. Why it could happen : The Suns&rsquo; package is valued high. Marion is an All-Star, Diaw is an all-around all-world talent, Banks might not have fit in well with the Suns&rsquo; style, but physically he is the perfect player for the triangle offence. I can not even fathom Kobe in the free flowing system of Mike D&rsquo;Antoni alongside Steve Nash. This would be too good to be true. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : The Suns are a top divisional rival of the Lakers, so they pretty much can forget about getting Bryant for anything less than Amare Stoudemire, and even that is a longshot. Darius Miles, Zach Randolph, Brandon Roy, future draft picks for Kobe. Why it could happen : The Blazers definitely keep this year&rsquo;s pick to select Greg Oden. Add Kobe and this is a contender straight away. The Lakers get this year&rsquo;s rookie of the year and an all-star next to the extremely talented but troublesome Miles. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Portland plays in the west. Plus the Lakers would hold out for Oden if they were to deal with the Blazers. Kenny Thomas, Ron Artest, Kevin Martin, John Salmons for Kobe and Farmar. Why it could happen : You&rsquo;re teaming up Mike Bibby, Brad Miller and Kobe &ndash; that is a devastating trio. Meanwhile the Lakers get quality starters for four positions and two of them are borderline All-Stars. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Same as the Suns, as division rivals it is going to be tough for the Kings to get into the bidding. : Brent Barry, Manu Ginobili, Robert Horry for Kobe. Why it could happen: Because the salaries match. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : After the Clippers, the most unlikely team the Lakers would deal with is the Spurs. Just forget this one unless Duncan is on the table, and he will never be. : Rashard Lewis and the Kevin Durant pick for Kobe. Why it could happen : Believe me, the Lakers would love it if Seattle were to offer this trade. Teaming up Ray Allen and Kobe would at the very least be interesting. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Kobe will not want to go to a team so badly in limbo as the Sonics. : Rasho Nesterovic, Anthony Parker, Jos&eacute; Calderon, Juan Dixon, Morris Peterson for Kobe and Brian Cook. Why it could happen : Another scenario where the Lakers get almost half of a whole team. Every single one of these players are hard workers and team players. Kobe paired with Bosh and TJ Ford would tear the East apart. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : This is the best the Raptors can realistically offer, plus Kobe probably does not want to be north of the border. : Andrei Kirilenko, Matt Harpring, draft picks for Kobe and Maurice Evans. Why it could happen : A perfect fantasy trade from last season. Kobe teaming up with the Carlos Boozer-Derron Williams duo is a scary thought. Kind of like imagining Jordan together with John Stockton and Karl Malone. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : I don&rsquo;t think I need to explain this: Kobe is not going to Salt Lake City. : Gilbert Arenas, Jarvis Hayes, Etan Thomas, draft picks for Kobe. Why it could happen : One of the best value deals. Agent Zero would probably love to show that he&rsquo;s better than Kobe by taking the Lakers to the second round of the play-offs. Whilst that is a longshot, imagine Antawn Jamison, Caron Butler and Kobe running Eddie Jordan&rsquo;s smooth offense together. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Actually, this one is feasible, but if there is a bidding war, as expected, the Wizards would be reluctant to include anyone else. So just where will Kobe end up? We might not know for quite a while, but there&rsquo;s a better chance of him landing with a team in the Eastern Conference. Of course, this is a Knicks fan talking here, so I might just be pressing my luck . . . Where do you think Kobe will end up? Post your thoughts below or submit your own article to Sportingo.

A visual tour of the battle for NHL supremacy between the Ducks and Senators A nation of rabid hockey fans watching the game on CBC (the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) on Wednesday got a lengthy close-up of Ottawa winger Mike Comrie, sitting on the Senators bench in recovery mode. Blood flowed slowly from both nostrils after an elbow from Anaheimâ€™s Francois Beauchemin, and a Senators trainer stood behind Comrie, working feverishly to stop the bleeding. Welcome to Bryan Murrayâ€™s world. The Ottawa Senators head coach needs to stop the bleeding â€” not now, but right now â€” with his Senators suddenly trailing this Stanley Cup finals 2-0. His team lost Game 2 by a 1-0 score, and for all intents and purposes, their season and another Canadian run at a Stanley Cup will hang in the balance Saturday night in Ottawa, where Game 3 will be played. Ottawa needs to win four of the next five games to salvage this Cup run, a Herculean task against an Anaheim team that looks oh so good right now. â€œWe just have to take advantage of home-ice advantage,â€ Murray said after the game. â€œWe've played well in our own building. We have to do it â€” absolutely have to do it this time â€” and give ourselves a chance to come back here and get one.â€ Murray has goaltending in spades, with Ray Emery playing his guts out in Game 2. But the girl that brought the Senators to this dance â€” their top line of Jason Spezza, Daniel Alfredsson and Dany Heatley â€” has suddenly lost her step in the face of Anaheimâ€™s tenacious checking unit centered by the hero of Game 2, goal scorer Samuel Pahlsson. For the second straight game, the Ducks checking line shut the Spezza line down while firing home the game-winning goal in the third period. In Game 1 it was Travis Moen, while last night Samuel Pahlsson lapped up a Heatley turnover near center ice, hopped in over the blue-line and snapped an unassisted goal that broke a scoreless tie at 14:16 of the third period. The puck went through defenseman Joe Corvoâ€™s legs before sneaking over the right pad and under the stick of goalie Ray Emery, who had played like a champion to hold an overmatched Senators team in the game. â€œOf course, itâ€™s fun to score the goal,â€ Pahlsson said. â€œBut itâ€™s always about winning in the playoffs. It doesnâ€™t really matter who does it.â€ We now have three days to marvel about what a fine team Brian Burke has built here in SoCal. The pressing issue as the series moves north, however, is what happened to the Senators? They won each of their first three series in five games, and Spezzaâ€™s line was far and away the most productive unit in these NHL playoffs â€” until now. Ducks lead Senators 2-0 Stanley Cup HQ: Matchups, outlook, more Check it out: Ducks' Pahlsson hero in Game 2 Opinion: Sens' stars must stop the bleeding Ducks' 'D' delivers again Sens' top line fading Expert: Senators won't be able to duck Ducks Opinion: Giguere aids family, then Ducks Discussion boards: Sound off on series If those three players donâ€™t start producing â€” again, not now but right now â€” the Senators will be the third Canadian team in as many playoff years to try and fail at bringing the old silver bowl back home. Last year Edmonton lost a seven-game final to Carolina, and in â€˜04 â€” with the lockout year in between â€” Tampa Bay beat Calgary in seven as well. â€œObviously,â€ said Spezza, who wasnâ€™t very good in Game 1 or 2 in Anaheim. â€œWeâ€™re the top line on the team, weâ€™ve been scoring up to this point, and weâ€™re expected to score goals. â€œItâ€™s not through lack of effort,â€ he added. â€œWeâ€™re trying.

Shaquille O'Neal and coach Phil Jackson have gone in-and-out of Kobe Bryant's career with the Lakers. Bryant's statistics with them: O'Neal (1996-97 to 1998-99) O'Neal and Jackson (1999-2000 to 2003-04) Jackson (2005-06 to 2006-07) Source: USA TODAY research TIMELINE: HOW KOBE, LAKERS GOT TO TRADE TALKS Two weeks after Kobe Bryant is drafted out of high school No. 13 overall by Charlotte, he is acquired in trade by Los Angeles Lakers GM Jerry West for Vlade Divac. Lakers sign free agent Shaquille O'Neal. Phil Jackson named Lakers head coach. With O'Neal and Bryant leading way, Jackson's Lakers win first of three consecutive NBA titles, beating Indiana 4-2. A short time later, West retires as GM and Mitch Kupchak takes over. With Bryant averaging 29.4 points in playoffs, Lakers beat Philadelphia 4-1 for second consecutive title. Lakers sweep New Jersey to win third NBA title in row. Bryant averages career-high 32.1 points in playoffs, but Lakers fall to San Antonio in Western Conference semifinals. Bryant is arrested and charged with sexual assault alleged in June at Colorado resort. Last season together for Bryant, O'Neal and Jackson is filled with turmoil -- including ongoing distraction of Bryant's sexual-assault case where he often shuttled between Colorado court proceedings and Lakers games. Yet Lakers make it to NBA Finals before falling to Detroit 4-1. After season, Jackson resigns, O'Neal is traded to Miami and Bryant signs $136 million deal. Sexual-assault case against Bryant is dropped when prosecutor says accuser could not advance case. Accuser later files civil suit that is settled for undisclosed amount. Lakers, without Jackson and O'Neal, miss the playoffs for only second time in 29 years. Jackson returns as head coach of Lakers. Bryant averages 35.4 points, the NBA's best in nearly 20 years. Jan. 22 he scores 81 against Toronto, second all time to Wilt Chamberlain's 100. Lakers are eliminated in first round by Phoenix after leading 3-1. O'Neal's Miami Heat, meanwhile, win first NBA title. he didn't tell ESPN in recent interview that he wanted West back and in full control or he would ask to be traded. "I would love for him to be a part of this," Bryant says. "But it's not something where I demand he comes here. ... I love being a Laker. I want to retire a Laker. I want to fix this thing or at least help any way I can." Bryant becomes infuriated after quotes Lakers "insider" as saying it was Bryant's insistence on getting away from O'Neal that prompted O'Neal's trade to Miami. Bryant tells ESPN Radio, "I would like to be traded. ... Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative." -- Bryant talks about meeting with owner Jerry Buss: "I went up to his penthouse suite. (Buss) looks me dead in the face and says, 'Kobe, I am not going to re-sign Shaq. I am not about to pay him $30 million a year or $80 million over three years. No way in hell. ... This is my decision. It's independent of you. My mind is made up. It doesn't matter to me what you do in free agency because I do not want to pay (Shaq).' " -- O'Neal responds to Bryant. "I believe Kobe 100%. Absolutely. There's no doubt in my mind Kobe is telling the truth. I believe him a thousand percent." -- Later Wednesday, after Bryant talks with Jackson, "I always dreamed about retiring as a Laker. I just hope and hope that something can be resolved. Something can be figured out. Just something so I can stay here." Is Kobe Bryant trade bait, or a Laker for life? By David DuPree, USA TODAY sent shockwaves through the NBA on Wednesday when he said in a radio interview he wanted to be traded from the Los Angeles Lakers. Reverberations continued even after the league's biggest star said later in another ESPN Radio interview he wanted to retire as a Laker. Audio of interview; Kobe's blog shows change of heart David DuPree assesses Kobe situation in chat transcript Bryant said the Lakers misled him about building an elite team and he no longer trusts them. On his website, he said he was frustrated by a newspaper report that said he was behind "That place is a mess," Bryant said, referring to the Lakers' front office. "If we're not making strides here to improve this team right now, to be aggressive in that nature, then what's the point of having me here? "I would like to be traded, yeah," continued Bryant, who has led the league in scoring the last two seasons. "Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative. It's rough man, but I don't see how you can rebuild that trust." In response to Bryant's trade talks, Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss issued the following statement: "We are aware of the media reports. However, Kobe has not told us directly that he wants to be traded. We have made it very clear that we are building our team around Kobe and that we intend for him to be a Laker his entire career. "We will speak directly to Kobe, and until we do that, we will not comment publicly about this." The two sides have a lot to discuss, as Bryant seemed to allow room for reconciliation after talking to Lakers coach Phil Jackson. "When Phil and I spoke, he was optimistic and determined that we'll both be back," Bryant told ESPN Radio. "Phil is somebody I listen to. I lean on him a lot. He assured me things are going to be OK. Things are going to be all right. &#8230; Which was very encouraging. I don't want to go anywhere else. I want to be here for the rest of my career." Feelings built up for Bryant: 's best explanation of the roller-coaster-like ride he led the Los Angeles Lakers on begins with feeling betrayed by the team. Bryant wrote on his website that he became infuriated Tuesday when the Los Angeles Times quoted "a Lakers insider" saying it was Bryant's insistence on not wanting to play any longer with that prompted the center's trade to the Miami Heat. That report, combined with his feeling that the Lakers were not building a contender, led to him saying Wednesday he wanted to be traded. Hours later he said he hoped something could be worked out. The Lakers haven't made a major trade, had a significant free agent signing or scored a draft coup since the O'Neal trade. After winning 20 playoff series and three NBA championships from 2000 to 2004, they have won only four postseason games in the last three years. They finished seventh in the Western Conference the last two seasons and were eliminated by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the playoffs both times. "Kobe is a very competitive guy and a team guy, but he wants to win," said Jack Ramsay, an ESPN analyst. "It would be a rarity for a team with that composition of players (Lakers current roster) to be a contending team. They're doing as well as they can by making the playoffs and taking Phoenix to seven games last year, which is commendable." Bryant wrote on his website Wednesday that Lakers owner Jerry Buss told him O'Neal was being traded for financial reasons and because of O'Neal's declining skills. Bryant was adamant that he had nothing to do with O'Neal's leaving and said he could no longer trust the team. "The more I thought about the future, the more I became convinced that the Lakers and me just have two different visions for the future," Bryant wrote. "The Lakers are pursuing a longer-term plan that is different from what Dr. Buss shared with me at the time I re-signed as a free agent. "I have seen that plan unfold for the last three years and watched great trade opportunities come and go and have seen free agents passed on. That has led to the Lakers not winning a playoff series. "All of that was frustrating in itself, but then this week to have someone 'inside' the Laker organization try to blame me in the media for us not being a contender right now &#8212; that is what brought me to my current position today." If Bryant, who turns 29 in August, goes on the trading block (he has a no-trade option in his contract, which means he can refuse any deal if it isn't to a team of his liking), it could cause a feeding frenzy. Ramsay says it's possible Bryant could still be traded. "I read in the Dallas paper Tuesday, the headline on the sports page was, 'Go for Kobe, and if it takes Dirk, it's worth it,' " Ramsay said. "That's a huge, huge statement. But I think teams will think in that direction. He's an amazing player, and there aren't any quite like him." Bryant was the only player in the league to average at least 30 points (31.6) and was an All-NBA first-team and NBA all-defensive first-team selection. Bryant has spent his entire 11-year NBA career with the Lakers. Only one active player, and his 12 seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves, has a longer tenure with one team. Three significant issues face any team looking to acquire : salary-cap limitations, who they are willing to give up and what it would do to team chemistry. Here are five possible front-runners (in order of likelihood): &#8212; The Knicks need a star to return the thrill to Madison Square Garden. Money is no object, and they have the players to give up to make a deal work, such as center &#8212; The Bulls have plenty of young talent to offer, but they may have their sights set on the Minnesota Timberwolves' . They'll have salary cap space. Unwilling to part with small forward in a possible deal for , they may do it to get Bryant. Also to offer: shooting guard &#8212; Owner Mark Cuban is still smarting from the Mavericks' first-round ouster and may feel a need to get into the Kobe sweepstakes and keep MVP , though the Los Angeles Lakers would almost certainly demand him. A package of guard might pique the Lakers' interest. &#8212; Clearly rebuilding, the Bobcats have good young players (Raymond Felton, calling the shots, Bryant knows everything would be done to get the right pieces around him. &#8212; A homecoming might be attractive to Bryant. The 76ers, with three first-round picks in next month's draft and small forward and rising young star , have plenty of pieces to entice the Lakers.

The Astros try to avoid matching the longest losing streak in franchise history when they conclude their three-game home set with the Cincinnati Reds on Thursday night. Cincinnati (21-33) owns the worst record in the NL, but Houston (21-31) is closing in on that dubious distinction after dropping the first two games of this series. Wednesday night's 4-3 defeat was the 10th in a row for the Astros - their longest skid since dropping a franchise-record 11 straight from Aug. 17-28, 1995. Poor hitting has been the biggest reason for the Astros' latest slump. Houston has scored only 20 total runs in the 10 defeats, while batting .216 overall and .193 with runners in scoring position. ''I don't ever remember it being quite this bad,'' Astros manager Phil Garner said. ''This is getting borderline stupid, too. We stung the ball really well and got nothing for it. Guys went to the plate and just didn't get anything.'' The Astros will try to get their offense back on track against struggling Cincinnati starter Bronson Arroyo (2-5, 4.01 ERA). In each of his last two starts, Arroyo has given up four runs in the first inning while letting the opposition bat around. The right-hander walked five batters and hit another while throwing a whopping 82 pitches in the two opening frames, demonstrating a puzzling lack of command for a pitcher who had yielded three earned runs or fewer in his previous eight starts. ''I don't know,'' catcher David Ross said as he tried to explain why Arroyo is scuffling. ''I wish I had the answers. He 's not getting the pitches he wants over for strikes. He's getting behind in the count, and when he does get ahead, he's not putting guys away. ''It's one of those things where you turn around and you don't really know what happened.'' Arroyo has pitched well in two starts against Houston this season, going 1-0 while allowing only three runs and eight hits over 14 innings. He earned the win at Minute Maid Park on May 1, when he yielded one run and three hits over seven innings of Cincinnati's 11-2 victory. The Astros also send a slumping pitcher to the mound in Woody Williams (1-7, 5.65). The 40-year-old right-hander and Houston native signed with the team last fall, but his return to his hometown has not gone well. Williams has received three or fewer runs of support in 10 of his 11 outings, but that is not entirely to blame for his poor record. He has allowed opponents to bat .293 against him this season, and is 0-2 with a 7.31 ERA and five home runs allowed over his last three outings. On Friday, Williams lasted only five innings and gave up four runs in a 13-3 loss at Arizona. Reds right fielder Ken Griffey Jr. has had great success against Williams, hitting .382 (13-for-34) with five homers, eight walks and a .500 on-base percentage versus the right-hander. Griffey went 1-for-4 with an RBI double Wednesday, snapping a stretch of four games without driving in a run.

Click me to Baseball roundup: Tuesday's action on the diamonds Pittsburgh Pirates' Freddie Sanchez, right, is tagged out by San Diego Padres second baseman Oscar Robles as he tries to advance to second after hitting an RBI single in the third inning of the baseball game in Pittsburgh, Tuesday. (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic) Published: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 (CP) - Jason Bay followed up his award-winning week with another big game. Hours after being named the National League's player of the week, the native of Trail, B.C., had two hits, including his eighth homer, in the Pittsburgh Pirates' 4-1 win over the San Diego Padres on Tuesday. It was Bay's hit his third homer in his past five games. He's 12-for-24 with three home runs and 11 RBIs in his past seven games. And with the Pirates winning, his recent excellent play means that much more. "A lot of times in the past you go on a little hot streak, and it doesn't mean as much because you're not winning," Bay said. "This has coincided with us winning so I think it means a little bit more." Elsewhere in the NL it was: Arizona 11 Philadelphia 5, Los Angeles 10 Washington 0, New York 5 San Francisco 4 (12 innings), Florida 9 Chicago 4, Cincinnati 2 Houston 1, Milwaukee 5 Atlanta 4 and Colorado 8 St. Louis 3. At Pittsburgh, Tom Gorzelanny lowered his ERA to 2.39 after overcoming a shaky first inning. Bay acknowledged that the left-hander is Pittsburgh's leader on the mound. "I'm not going to say he came out of nowhere," Bay said, "but he's our bona fide guy right now. He's our stopper. It's nice to have that guy that goes out there every single day and you're thinking he's going to throw a gem and give you a chance to win." Josh Bard went 3-for-4 and Jose Cruz had two hits for the Padres, who had won three in a row and six of seven. Gorzelanny (6-3) scattered seven hits while allowing the one run, striking out four and walking three as the Pirates won for the fourth time in five games. Gorzelanny allowed only eight earned runs in his six starts in May. "I'm still a long ways from being established," said Gorzelanny, who is in his second full season in the majors. "And I'm just going to go out there, do my thing, work hard. I know there's still a lot of things I have to work on, especially with my pitch count." That negative aspect of his game was on display in the first inning, when Gorzelanny threw 34 pitches and loaded the bases before escaping unscathed. "He showed tremendous signs of a very mature guy out there," Pirates manager Jim Tracy said. "In the first inning of the game it looks like 'How far are we going to be able to get with him with 34 pitches in the first inning?' He just kept battling. This guy finds ways. "He kept getting better as the night goes on." The only run he allowed was a sacrifice fly by Termel Sledge that scored Kevin Kouzmanoff in the sixth. Other than the first inning, he twice stranded runners at second base. The last batter Gorzelanny faced was Adrian Gonzalez, with a runner on and two outs in the seventh. Gorzelanny struck him out with his 120th pitch. "You've got to give credit to their guy," San Diego manager Bud Black said. "He wobbled a little bit but made a couple of pitches that get them out of the inning. A hit in that inning with a couple of guys on would have been nice but Gorzelanny hung in there and made some pitches.

Either that or baseball fans in Houston are in for a long, miserable summer at the ballpark. The season slipped a little closer toward becoming a certified disaster Wednesday night when the Astros again struggled to score and plunged to their 10th consecutive loss, 4-3 to the Cincinnati Reds at Minute Maid Park. The defeat dropped the Astros (21-31) to 10 games under .500 and one game ahead of the last-place Reds in the National League Central. It's their longest losing streak since they dropped a club-record 11 consecutive games from Aug. 17-28, 1995. "That's how many? Ten? And really in crappy fashion," manager Phil Garner said. "We have not hit the ball. We went a bunch of times without scoring runs when (Roger Clemens) was pitching, and I called that stupid, but this is bordering on stupid now, too. This is really ridiculous." The Astros have given up more runs (72) during their losing streak than they have hits (71). They managed just six hits, including two doubles, against Reds starter Aaron Harang, who needed only 105 pitches to throw his ninth career complete game. Harang retired 14 in a row in one stretch and sent down the final six batters he faced, retiring the Astros in order on seven pitches in the ninth. "It's a pretty frustrating time for us," said second baseman Craig Biggio, who made two errors. "I've seen a couple of guys struggle a little bit, but not as many as we have right now, and that's frustrating. We need to get this monkey off our back and get a 'W' and hopefully get more guys contributing and pitching in and doing the little things to win baseball games." The Astros fell behind 3-0 in the first inning before many in the crowd of 31,904 had found their seats. Considering how poorly the offense has been performing, the hopes for a comeback were bleak. Somehow, the players remain positive. "I'm coming out each day more and more fired up," third baseman Morgan Ensberg said. "I recognize this is a flat-out dogfight, this is a battle, and I refuse to give in. I'm not going to lie down. I'm going to go out there and do absolutely everything I can to do something positive." The first three Reds hitters reached and scored against Astros starter Wandy Rodriguez (2-5), who labored through five innings. Norris Hopper doubled and scored on Alex Gonzalez's single, and Ken Griffey Jr. drove home Gonzalez with a double and scored on Adam Dunn's single to make it 3-0. "I started really rough, but I tried to fight back and keep the game close so we could tie it," Rodriguez said. "The first inning I had a few bad pitches, but I came back and was able to hit my spots." Carlos Lee recorded his 46th RBI of the season in the bottom of the first with a double to score Ensberg. Cincinnati took a 4-1 lead in the sixth when Hopper scored from first on a Gonzalez double, though it appeared shortstop Adam Everett had a shot to throw him out at the plate with his relay throw. "I was a little surprised," Garner said. "I thought we were going to get him." Harang (6-2) had retired 14 in a row, including striking out the side in the fifth, before Lee led off the seventh with a single. Hunter Pence reached on an error, and Everett singled to center one out later to score Lee and get the Astros within 4-2. But the Astros couldn't get closer in the inning as pinch hitters Mike Lamb and Orlando Palmeiro both popped out to short. The Astros sliced the deficit to 4-3 in the eighth. Biggio led off with a double to right — his 2,974th career hit — and scored on Berkman's sizzling grounder to short that Gonzalez was surprisingly able to stop. That was one of three balls the Astros struck hard late in the game but right at Reds defenders. "Every night I come to the ballpark thinking this is the night we're going to throw together 20 hits and 55 runs, and sooner or later you're going to catch up," Garner said.

Owner Craig Leipold has signed a letter of intent to sell the Predators to Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie, a deal with a closing date of June 30. The National Hockey League's free-agent window opens the very next day. Email to a friend Nashville has seven players set to become unrestricted free agents, including captain Kimmo Timonen and forwards Paul Kariya and Peter Forsberg. The NHL's board of governors still has to approve the sale, leaving players and agents in need of answers from the team and general manager David Poile. "I don't think the league wants David Poile to hit July 1 not knowing who his owner is and not knowing what direction it's going to go in," Timonen's agent, Bill Zito, said yesterday. "We have a 100-point team, and now, all of the sudden, it's going to disintegrate because of the timing of legalities? That doesn't make any sense." Poile and Leipold both declined interview requests yesterday. Poile was said to be awaiting direction. Rumours have swirled around the franchise since Balsillie's purchase agreement was announced last week. There has been talk the Predators could move to Winnipeg, Hamilton or to Balsillie's base near Waterloo -- talk that will likely continue despite NHL commissioner Gary Bettman's claim on Monday that it "is not going anywhere." "I know if I was a free agent thinking about signing that would be the first question I'd be asking," Nashville centre Jason Arnott told The Tennessean. The Predators were already going to face a challenge in resigning at least a couple of their marquee names, especially Timonen, who is primed for the largest payday of his career after registering at least 40 points for the fifth straight year. The 32-year-old defenceman made US$2.28-million last season, but is thought to be looking at the deal fellow defenceman Andrei Markov signed with the Montreal Canadiens on Monday as comparable. Markov signed a four-year contract reported to be worth US$23-million. Forsberg is also weighing his options. "He's had all these health issues for a couple of years," agent Don Baizley said yesterday. "And he's got to, first of all, find out whether they can be resolved to the point that he can play at the level he expects of himself. And I don't think that's a decision that he's going to make any time soon." Baizley did say his clients -- Forsberg and Kariya -- would also want to know about Nashville's situation. "I really think it's going to be business as usual," NHL player agent Allan Walsh said. "I don't feel that the sale is going to impact much on players' decisions to sign there, one way or the other. Management has been very stable and very consistent over the years and if you listen to what is being said on the NHL side, and on the ownership side, it does not appear that franchise move is imminent."

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/c/a/2007/05/31/GIANTS.TMP&cid Giants rebound from tough loss Giants rebound from tough loss Henry Schulman, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, May 30, 2007 (05-30) 20:43 PDT New York -- - You could argue from now until the next ice age whether Barry Zito was worth $126 million, but you cannot dispute that he was worth his weight in diamonds to the woebegone Giants on Wednesday night. One night after a loss that sucked the oxygen from their blood and the joy from their souls, the Giants needed a little nourishment and Zito gave them a seven-course feast. He blanked the New York Mets for seven innings, defining the term "stopper," in a 3-0 victory that ended his team's losing streak at four games. "It was awesome, outstanding," said shortstop Omar Vizquel, who contributed four excellent defensive plays. "I think he knew he needed to turn it on tonight and he did, in New York, against a good team. He wanted to show everybody out here what he was all about. It was a great outcome for him." Some pitchers say all wins are the same. Zito recognized this one was not, that after Tuesday's 12-inning balk-a-palooza he had to stand 11 feet high against 295-game winner Tom Glavine, because that is what an ace is supposed to do. "I take that seriously," Zito said. "In 2002 with Oakland I had a real good record after losses (13-1). That's something the team feeds off of. When we had a losing streak, the team could rely on me. It's an important role." Zito allowed six hits, walked one and struck out a season-high seven for his second consecutive victory and his second win against the Mets. He swore he does not want to pitch "with a vendetta against people," but here is a fact: Before the Giants sent the Brinks truck to Zito's driveway, he was negotiating with the Mets. A little birdie spread word that Zito no longer was an ace and no better than a middle-rotation starter, perhaps to drive his price down. Zito believed the birdie had "M-E-T-S" written across its chest. Commanding his curveball and rarely making Bengie Molina move his glove, Zito held Tuesday heroes Jose Reyes and Carlos Delgado hitless in five at-bats combined. No Met reached third base. After throwing 122 pitches, Zito gave way to Jack Taschner for a scoreless eighth, and Brad Hennessey fanned Delgado to start a perfect ninth for his third career save, a good audition should the Giants decide to try another closer. The vilified Armando Benitez was said to be unavailable with swelling in his right knee, which needed to be drained. Pedro Feliz drove in all three runs in rallies that began with two outs. He hit a bases-loaded single on a 3-2 pitch in the first inning that scored Rich Aurilia and Barry Bonds, who each had singled. In the third, Molina singled and scored from first on Feliz's triple off the center-field wall. Feliz had been 2-for-12 lifetime against Glavine. Feliz hit each ball when he was ahead in the count. Perhaps he is learning from Molina, who bats ahead of him and wears pitchers out. Molina saw eight pitches when he walked in the first inning to load the bases and 10 more when he singled in the third. "He is a grinder," manager Bruce Bochy said of his catcher. "He competes so well. He gets great at-bats and he never gives away at-bats. He battles all the time. We know about the clutch hits, and even when he doesn't get a hit, he knows how to build the count up and use all fields." Perhaps the best development for the Giants was Aurilia's 4-for-4 night, coming toward the end of what he described Tuesday as "one of the worst months I've had in a long time." He was 9-for-67 in May before facing Glavine. "I think I matched my last three-week total for hits tonight," Aurilia said. "I made a few adjustments in the cage before the game with the staff. There were a couple of things my teammates saw. It was great to actually implement it and have it work. Hopefully, I can keep it up." The team hopes Zito can keep it up, too. He has allowed one run in his last 14 innings to improve to 5-5. Vizquel faced Zito in the American League and was asked if the left-hander looks the same from behind now as he did when Vizquel used to face him from the batter's box. Vizquel thought for a second and said, "I see a bigger ass now." E-mail Henry Schulman at This article appeared on page Get up to 50% off home delivery of the Chronicle for 12 weeks!

Briefing Room 2007 NFL Draft order NFL Hall of Fame Mavs' owner Cuban says pro football demand is greater than supply Updated: May 31, 2007, 1:03 AM ET owner Mark Cuban is part of a group considering formation of a football league that would compete with the NFL for players drafted lower than the second round. The league, still very much in the preliminary stage, would play its games on Friday nights. The NFL does not play then because of the potential conflict with high school football. "It's a pretty simple concept," Cuban said in an e-mail to The Associated Press. "We think there is more demand for pro football than supply." It's a pretty simple concept. We think there is more demand for pro football than supply. The proposal was first disclosed by The New York Times on its Web site, which said it was the idea of Bill Hambrecht, a Wall Street investor who was a minority partner in the Oakland Invaders of the USFL, which played in the spring from 1983-85. Sharon Smith, a spokeswoman for Hambrecht and Company, had no comment and said Hambrecht was traveling and unavailable to talk about the idea. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said he was aware of the proposed league, but had no further comment. On his blog, Cuban explained how the new league, dubbed the UFL, would actually be good for the NFL. "The NFL wants and needs competition," Cuban wrote. "They have grown so big and powerful that every move they make is scrutinized by local or federal officials. A competitor allows them to point to us and explain that their moves are for competitive reasons rather than the move of a monopoly." There have been numerous leagues that have tried to compete with the NFL and a few that actually played games, starting with the AFL, which began in 1960 and fully merged with the NFL a decade later. It included such current franchises as New England, Oakland, Kansas City, San Diego, Buffalo, the New York Jets and Denver. More recently came the World Football League in the early 1970s, which raided the NFL for such stars as Larry Csonka. Then came the USFL, which played in the spring before folding after receiving only $3 in an antitrust "victory" over the NFL. The USFL featured such future Hall of Famers as Jim Kelly, Reggie White and Steve Young, but lost millions of dollars trying to compete for players. It also had internal struggles among a majority of owners who wanted to stay in the spring, and the best known among them, Donald Trump, who wanted to move to the fall and try to force a merger with the NFL. The most recent pro football league was the XFL, founded by the World Wrestling Federation and televised by NBC. The XFL lasted just three months in the spring of 2001 and was best known for a player named Rod Smart, called "He Hate Me," who later played as a return man and backup running back in the NFL. So far, the proposed new league is in its infancy and Cuban is the only potential owner for what the founders hope will be an eight-team league. Cuban said in his e-mail he believes the salary cap makes it easier to compete financially with the NFL because of the salary imbalance that leaves lower-level players with lower salaries. That would allow the new league to fill its rosters with players taken lower than the second round, as well as late NFL cuts and free agents who escape the NFL draft. Many such players, including , a sixth-round pick of New England, have become NFL stars. "That's not to say it will be easy. It won't," Cuban wrote. "We still have to cover quite a bit of ground and have a lot of milestones to hit. That said, if we can get the right owners I obviously think we can make this work." The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The senate is expected approve a bill that would lift long-time restrictions on reselling tickets to sporting events, concerts and shows. The state Assembly has already voted for the bill, which could be signed into law tomorrow, when the state's old anti-scalping law expires. Under the proposed rules, the state would stop capping prices for tickets sold on the secondary market. Scalpers would still be banned from selling tickets within 1,500 feet of large arenas. But for the first time, it would be entirely legal for average fans to scalp their seats on the Internet.

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/c/a/2007/05/31/FOOTBALL.TMP&cid New league looking to challenge the NFL New league looking to challenge the NFL Verne Kopytoff, Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday, May 31, 2007 A rival to the National Football League, funded by prominent San Francisco investment banker Bill Hambrecht and Google Inc. executive Tim Armstrong, is being planned for next summer, according to a spokeswoman for Hambrecht. The United Football League hopes to field teams in eight cities that have no NFL franchises, including Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Mexico City. The founders are counting on fan support and a cable television deal to make the league profitable after five years. Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, already has signed on as team owner, according to a report Wednesday in the New York Times. But taking on the NFL, among the most popular leagues in professional sports and a television ratings juggernaut, is risky. A number of upstarts have tried and failed, such as the XFL, which folded in 2001 after one season, the United States Football League, which finished the last of its three seasons in 1985, and the World Football League, which survived two seasons in the 1970s. "The odds are against any competitive league that goes up against the NFL," said Dan Rascher, associate professor of sports management at the University of San Francisco. "Maybe if they play in the off-season -- there's plenty of football fans who want to see football 12 months a year." Hambrecht and Armstrong were unavailable for comment. The NFL declined a request for an interview. The new league is still in the early planning stages and is without players, coaches or much of an executive staff beyond two dot-com entrepreneurs who previously worked for the National Basketball Association. The likelihood of a UFL team in the Bay Area is remote, given that there already are two established NFL franchises in the area to compete against -- the Oakland Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers. Aside from Cuban, who is known for his bombast and iconoclastic business sense, no other owners are lined up for the league. Boone Pickens, a Texas billionaire, had intended to buy a team but recently pulled out, according to the Times. Owners would pay $30 million for an initial half-interest in a team, and the league would own the other half. Teams later would sell shares to the public in an effort to raise an additional $60 million per franchise. Star players, who demand multi-million-dollar salaries, are not likely to be recruited by the new league. Rather, lower tier players, including those cut from the NFL, will fill the ranks and be paid lower salaries. Rascher supported the new league's strategy to target cities without NFL teams, saying that many large markets with existing stadiums are hungry for football. Keeping ticket prices low may lure fans who are loathe to pay for the NFL's pricier seats. The New York Times first reported about the new league Wednesday. A Hambrecht spokeswoman confirmed that the article was accurate. Hambrecht is the founder and chief executive of WR Hambrecht + Co, an investment bank known for championing initial public offerings that are priced in an auction rather than in back-room deals. He also was a minority investor in the USFL's Oakland Invaders until the league shut. Armstrong is president of Google's advertising sales in North America and recently invested in a professional lacrosse franchise in Boston. Both men have pledged $2 million for the league. In doing so, they join a long list of successful businessmen who have tried their hands at professional sports, including Cuban and Oracle's Larry Ellison, who races yachts. Arena Football is now the only challenger to the NFL, and only to a limited extent. The upstart league, which plays in arenas that have a much smaller capacity than stadiums, fields eight-man teams and hold its season in the spring, so it doesn't compete with the NFL.
