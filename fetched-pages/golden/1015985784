One night after a loss that sucked the oxygen from their blood and the joy from their souls, the Giants needed a little nourishment and Zito gave them a seven-course feast. He blanked the New York Mets for seven innings, defining the term "stopper," in a 3-0 victory that ended his team's losing streak at four games. "It was awesome, outstanding," said shortstop Omar Vizquel, who contributed four excellent defensive plays. "I think he knew he needed to turn it on tonight and he did, in New York, against a good team. He wanted to show everybody out here what he was all about. It was a great outcome for him." Some pitchers say all wins are the same. Zito recognized this one was not, that after Tuesday's 12-inning balk-a-palooza he had to stand 11 feet high against 295-game winner Tom Glavine, because that is what an ace is supposed to do. "I take that seriously," Zito said. "In 2002 with Oakland I had a real good record after losses (13-1). That's something the team feeds off of. When we had a losing streak, the team could rely on me. It's an important role." Zito allowed six hits, walked one and struck out a season-high seven for his second consecutive victory and his second win against the Mets. He swore he does not want to pitch "with a vendetta against people," but here is a fact: Before the Giants sent the Brinks truck to Zito's driveway, he was negotiating with the Mets. A little birdie spread word that Zito no longer was an ace and no better than a middle-rotation starter, perhaps to drive his price down. Zito believed the birdie had "M-E-T-S" written across its chest. Commanding his curveball and rarely making Bengie Molina move his glove, Zito held Tuesday heroes Jose Reyes and Carlos Delgado hitless in five at-bats combined. No Met reached third base. After throwing 122 pitches, Zito gave way to Jack Taschner for a scoreless eighth, and Brad Hennessey fanned Delgado to start a perfect ninth for his third career save, a good audition should the Giants decide to try another closer. The vilified Armando Benitez was said to be unavailable with swelling in his right knee, which needed to be drained. Pedro Feliz drove in all three runs in rallies that began with two outs. He hit a bases-loaded single on a 3-2 pitch in the first inning that scored Rich Aurilia and Barry Bonds, who each had singled. In the third, Molina singled and scored from first on Feliz's triple off the center-field wall. Feliz had been 2-for-12 lifetime against Glavine. Feliz hit each ball when he was ahead in the count. Perhaps he is learning from Molina, who bats ahead of him and wears pitchers out. Molina saw eight pitches when he walked in the first inning to load the bases and 10 more when he singled in the third. "He is a grinder," manager Bruce Bochy said of his catcher. "He competes so well. He gets great at-bats and he never gives away at-bats. He battles all the time. We know about the clutch hits, and even when he doesn't get a hit, he knows how to build the count up and use all fields." Perhaps the best development for the Giants was Aurilia's 4-for-4 night, coming toward the end of what he described Tuesday as "one of the worst months I've had in a long time." He was 9-for-67 in May before facing Glavine. "I think I matched my last three-week total for hits tonight," Aurilia said. "I made a few adjustments in the cage before the game with the staff. There were a couple of things my teammates saw. It was great to actually implement it and have it work. Hopefully, I can keep it up." The team hopes Zito can keep it up, too. He has allowed one run in his last 14 innings to improve to 5-5. Vizquel faced Zito in the American League and was asked if the left-hander looks the same from behind now as he did when Vizquel used to face him from the batter's box. Vizquel thought for a second and said, "I see a bigger ass now." E-mail Henry Schulman at This article appeared on page Get up to 50% off home delivery of the Chronicle for 12 weeks!

Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Jesse Litsch, left, and Sal Fasano react to a play against the New York Yankees during the first inning of last night's game. Toronto's Litsch pounded early ending Jays' two-game win streak TORONTO (May 31, 2007) The Toronto Blue Jays found a way to make things interesting last night after reality kicked rookie Jesse Litsch right in the gut. Litsch, a mere 22 and the toast of the town two weeks ago when he pitched a gem in his big-league debut, was pounded for five runs and failed to escape the first inning. His teammates nearly rallied against the shaky New York Yankees, pulling within one a two-run shot by Matt Stairs in the seventh, but ultimately fell short in a 10-5 loss. Some more dubious on-field antics by Alex Rodriguez in the ninth gave things a nasty turn. The Yankees scored four in the inning, three of them after Rodriguez seemed to yell "Mine!" while running past third baseman Howie Clark as he settled under Jorge Posada's pop fly. Instead of an inning-ending out with the score 7-5, Clark flinched and dropped the ball, allowing another run to score. Shortstop John McDonald immediately began jawing at Rodriguez and had to be restrained by Clark. Manager John Gibbons ran out to argue the play with the umpires and later shouted at Rodriguez as he walked off the field. Jason Giambi followed with a two-run single that made it 10-5. It wouldn't be the first time Rodriguez pulled such a stunt on the field. In Game 6 of the 2004 ALCS versus Boston, he slapped at pitcher Bronson Arroyo's glove on a play at first base. The defeat ended a modest two-game win streak for the Blue Jays (24-28) before a crowd of 29,187 and temporarily stopped the bleeding for the nine-time AL East-champion Yankees. New York (22-29) had lost five straight and 13 of 18 coming into this one and woke up yesterday morning to find pictures of Rodriguez at his hotel with a woman that wasn't his wife splashed all over the New York Post under the headline, "Stray-Rod." It could have been another dagger for an already reeling team but they instead took out some frustration against Litsch (1-2), whose spot on the roster is in doubt with ace Roy Halladay set to come off the disabled list to start against Chicago.

The Anaheim Ducks' centre, who has found the National Hockey League playoff spotlight because of his stingy work on the defensive side of the puck, continued to lift his team with some timely offence. Pahlsson, who scored the series-winner against the Detroit Red Wings to put the Ducks into the Stanley Cup final, scored only his third goal of the playoffs on a screen shot with 5 minutes 44 seconds remaining to give the Ducks a 1-0 victory over the Ottawa Senators last night and a 2-0 lead in the series, which will shift to Ottawa for the next two games at Scotiabank Place on Saturday and Monday. The game-winning play, which transpired before a sellout crowd of 17,258 at the Honda Center, began when Senators forward Dany Heatley turned the puck over at the Anaheim blueline. Print Edition - Section Front History not on Ottawa's side now Rodriguez's call-out leaves Jays fuming Yankees light up Litsch to avoid sweep Allen faces challenge for starter's job Montreal club ready to add another chapter to its rich history Go to the section Instead of dumping the puck in, Heatley attempted a cute pass to linemate Jason Spezza and the puck squirted to Pahlsson. Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson was unable to stymie his Swedish countryman on the backcheck and Pahlsson's shot beat Senators goaltender Ray Emery, who was screened by Ottawa defenceman Joe Corvo. &#34;On that particular play, we turned the puck over and Alfredsson couldn't get his stick on him,&#34; Senators head coach Bryan Murray said. &#34;That's been the key. We're committing turnovers and creating chances for them.&#34; The Ducks' checking line also scored the game-winner in the first game of the series, when Travis Moen put the puck into the net late in the third period on Monday. &#34;[Anaheim's] defence and checking line have been the stars so far,&#34; Murray said. In the territorial play, the Ducks completely dominated the second game. They outshot the Senators 30-16 (60-36 in the series so far), missed 18 more, while the Senators blocked 20 more. Ottawa, on the other hand, has had difficulty generating any sustained periods of offensive pressure. &#34;They keep the puck on the outside very well,&#34; Murray said. &#34;We had some good fore-checks, but couldn't take advantage of it. &#34;We have to take advantage of our home ice.&#34; Senators forward Peter Schaefer had a half-open net to shoot at with slightly more than three minutes remaining, but his rebound attempt was deflected wide off the stick of Anaheim defenceman Sean O'Donnell. Ducks goalie Jean-S&#233;bastien Gigu&#232;re earned his sixth career playoff shutout as he blanked the Senators, who have not scored in the past 90:24 of the series. The Senators showed up for the the second game with new line combinations, as Murray decided to split up his No. 1 trio of Spezza, Alfredsson and Heatley, although they were together on power plays. Spezza and Heatley played alongside tough guy Chris Neil, while Alfredsson played with centre Mike Fisher and Schaefer. The Senators' third line featured Chris Kelly between Antoine Vermette and Mike Comrie. Murray replaced fourth-liner Patrick Eaves in the lineup with Oleg Saprykin, who scored a game-winning goal early in the Eastern Conference final against the Buffalo Sabres. So how did the Ducks counteract the Senators' alterations? Head coach Randy Carlyle kept his checking specialists - Pahlsson, Rob Niedermayer and Travis Moen, the hero of the first game - against Spezza. The Ducks' No. 1 unit of Andy McDonald, Teemu Selanne and Andrew Miller went up against the Alfredsson line. Both teams had three power-play opportunities in the goalless opening 20 minutes. The Senators had a 68-second 5-on-3 advantage, during which Comrie slammed a rebound attempt off the post. The Ducks had two close calls early in the period, but Emery stopped shots by Selanne and Ryan Getzlaf. The Pahlsson line got the better of its opponents early in the second period, but either failed to finish or could not find a way to beat Emery. Spezza was reunited with Alfredsson and Heatley later in the second period, a move recommended by former Detroit Red Wings head coach Scotty Bowman when he discussed strategy with Murray earlier in the week. Bowman counselled Murray to break up his big line, only to reunite it periodically. Number of 5-on-5 goals for the Ottawa Senators during the first and second games of the Stanley Cup final. Sami Pahlsson of the Anaheim Ducks skates by Ottawa's Daniel Alfredsson to score the game-winner with less than six minutes to play in the third period.

The Grizzlies declined to provide more details about the news conference. The Commercial Appeal newspaper, citing unidentified sources close to the search, reported that the Grizzlies have agreed to a three-year deal with Iavaroni. A news conference is scheduled for 3 p.m. ET Thursday. An assistant to Grizzlies owner Michael Heisley told The Associated Press he was unavailable for comment. Iavaroni, who joined the Suns coaching staff in 2002, is a 14-year veteran of the NBA as a player and coach. He was an assistant and director of player development for the under Pat Riley before joining the Suns. Memphis finished the season at 22-60, for the worst record in the league, and ended up a disappointing fourth in the June 28 draft lottery. At 6-24, the Grizzlies fired former coach Mike Fratello in December, replacing him with Tony Barone Sr., the team's director of player personnel. Barone's appointment was announced as temporary and he is expected to return to non-coaching duties with the franchise. The disappointing season, which began with star sidelined with a foot injury, followed three straight trips to the NBA playoffs. The Grizzlies moved to Memphis in 2001 and under president Jerry West, who joined the team the following year, made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history in 2004. The Grizzlies were swept in all three playoff appearances, however, and have the league's longest postseason losing streak. West has said he will leave the Grizzlies when his contract expires July 1. Iavaroni was an NBA player from 1982-1989 with Philadelphia, San Antonio and Utah. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

"I know it was a long time ago," Bedard said. He was reminded that it was April 18 at Tampa Bay. "That's a long time," Bedard said. It's not because he had been pitching poorly, but quite the contrary. In his first five May starts, he was 0-1 with a 2.12 earned run average, allowing just eight runs and 21 hits in 34 innings. The Orioles, however, scored but 12 runs in those five starts. Bedard is back in the 'W' column after throwing eight scoreless innings in a 3-0 victory over the Royals on Wednesday night. The Orioles have won five straight in a season for the first time since an eight-game winning streak in April, 2005. "I'm sure the lack of wins has been on his mind a little bit," Orioles manager Sam Perlozzo said. "I thought it was a great effort tonight from him. We hung in there and persevered." Bedard said "it's part of the game," to go through a stretch of winless starts. "It happened last year," he said. "It happens every year; you go through a span where you won't win five or six games in a row and then you'll win four or five in a row." The Orioles managed just one hit off Royals starter Gil Meche in the first six innings and neither team scored in the first seven innings. "It's always tough when it zero-zero late in the game," Bedard said. Ramon Hernandez led off the eighth with a walk and Freddie Bynum ran for him. Manager Sam Perlozzo ordered Corey Patterson to put down a sacrifice bunt and the speedy Patterson beat it out. "I had to sacrifice and everybody in the whole park knew I was doing it," Patterson said. "I got the sign. I just really concentrated on getting it down. I had a pretty good touch on it and since I run pretty good, [I] was able to beat it out. We have a lot better chance there with runners on first and second with no outs than a runner at second with one out, so I was glad to contribute to that." Brian Roberts' sacrifice bunt advanced the runners to second and third. With the infield in Jay Payton wormed a single to left to score Bynum to break the scoreless deadlock. "I think he [Payton] likes the stage a little bit," Perlozzo said. "He likes being the guy. That's good. I hope that rubs off on everyone." Said Payton, "I was fortunate to get the ball through the infield and help us win a ball game. I think it was a slider and down. It probably wasn't even a strike. I was looking to stay back and hit the ball up the middle and got in front of it a little bit and found a hole." Bedard held the Royals to four singles, walked two and struck out five, throwing 112 pitches before departing after eight innings, which matches his career high. "Bedard has been phenomenal," Payton said. "It's nice to get him a win. He's been pitching great for us and we haven't been able to push a lot of runs across for him. When you're the ace of the staff, a lot of times you run against the other's team ace and run into some hard luck." In sweeping the three games at Kauffman Stadium, the Orioles' trio of Steve Trachsel, Jeremy Guthrie and Bedard limited the Royals to 12 hits and three runs in 24 innings. Nick Markakis, who was inserted as a defensive replacement in the eighth, hit a two-run homer in the ninth off reliever Zack Greinke for the final runs. Bedard pitched out of a jam in the third when John Buck and Tony Pena Jr. singled, putting runners on the corners with one out. Bedard struck out Esteban German and retired David DeJesus on a soft liner to Roberts to strand the runners. "To get out of trouble early is really the key in pitching," Bedard said. "I made some good pitches at the right time and I got them out." Chris Ray worked a flawless ninth, striking out one, to log his 12th save in 14 opportunities. Rain delayed the start of the game for 96 minutes, but not the inevitable: the Orioles improving to 6-0 against the Royals this season. is a contributor to MLB.com This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.

It did, however, help the New York Yankees snap a five-game losing streak. Rodriguez distracted Toronto third baseman Howie Clark by shouting at him on a key popup in the ninth inning, touching off arguments all over the field, and the Yankees beat the Blue Jays 10-5 Wednesday night. "I just said, 'Hah!' That's it," Rodriguez said. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't." "I don't know what my intention was," he said. "I didn't say, 'I got it' or anything like that." Clark claimed Rodriguez called for the ball. "I heard a 'Mine' call and so I let it go," Clark said. "What do you do? It makes you mad." In other AL games it was, Minnesota 7, Chicago 6; Oakland 6, Texas 1; Cleveland 8, Boston 4; Tampa Bay 5, Detroit 3; Baltimore 3, Kansas City 0; and Los Angeles 8, Seattle 6. At Toronto, Rodriguez hit an RBI single with two outs in the ninth that made it 7-5. Jorge Posada followed with a high infield pop and Rodriguez ran hard, cutting between Clark and shortstop John McDonald. Replays showed Rodriguez shouting something, and Clark backed off at the last second. McDonald was only a few steps behind Clark, but couldn't make the catch and ball dropped for an RBI single. After the play, McDonald started jawing with Rodriguez, and third base umpire Chad Fairchild got between them. Blue Jays manager John Gibbons came out to argue, and exchanged words with Rodriguez and third base coach Larry Bowa before leaving the field as plate umpire Eric Cooper intervened. Rodriguez stayed on the bag with a smirk. "The thing about the Yankees, one of the reasons they're so respected, is they do things right. Always have," Gibbons said. "They've got a lot of pride and a lot of class. They play the game hard. "That's not Yankee pride right there. That's not the way they play. I thought it was bush league." Clark said he'd never seen &#8212; or heard &#8212; that play before. "This is my 16th season and it's never happened once," he said. As Jason Giambi stepped up to hit after the popup, he seemed to get into it with catcher Jason Phillips and Cooper settled them down. Giambi followed with a two-run single. When the game ended, many of the Blue Jays stayed on the bench, staring at Rodriguez and the Yankees. Rodriguez brushed aside the Blue Jays' anger, saying the Yankees were "desperate" for a win. "Honestly, I couldn't care less," he said. "They have their opinions. We're looking not to be swept." Rodriguez said he's often heckled by opposing players. "That play happens to me three or four times a week, except it's not at third base, it's over in foul territory by the dugout," Rodriguez said. The Yankees didn't quite know what to think. "I wasn't sure that was allowed," outfielder Johnny Damon said. "If it is, maybe we'll keep on doing it." Said manager Joe Torre: "I don't know what to feel for it. It's not like he said, 'I got it.'" New York took a quick lead against rookie Jesse Litsch (1-2), scoring five times in the first inning. Yankees rookie Tyler Clippard (2-1) gave up three runs and four hits over five innings. Twins 7, White Sox 6 At Minneapolis, Torii Hunter walked with the bases loaded in the ninth inning, forcing in the winning run and lifting the Twins over the struggling White Sox for a three-game sweep. The Twins handed the White Sox their fourth straight loss and moved past Chicago into third place in the AL Central. Mike MacDougal (1-2) took the loss when walked Hunter on four pitches. Joe Nathan (2-1) entered in the ninth and pitched a 1-2-3 inning. Athletics 6, Rangers 1 Dan Haren won his sixth straight decision and Dan Johnson drove in three runs for host Oakland. Haren (6-2) lowered his ERA to an AL-leading 1.64. He gave up four hits in eight innings. Sammy Sosa went 0-for-4 and remained two home runs from becoming the fifth player to reach the 600 mark. Texas called up John Koronka (0-2) from Triple-A Oklahoma to make the start. Devil Rays 5, Tigers 3 James Shields settled after a shaky first inning to throw the second complete game of his career, Elijah Dukes and Brendan Harris backed the right-hander with solo homers for host Tampa Bay. Shields (4-0) yielded three runs and five hits in the opening inning, then allowed just three runners to reach base over the next eight innings. He earned his first win in nearly four weeks. Dukes hit his 10th homer of the season in the fifth and Harris snapped a 3-3 tie against left-hander Nate Robertson (4-5) in the sixth. Indians 8, Red Sox 4 Paul Byrd won his fifth straight decision and extended his streak without issuing a walk to 43 innings, and visiting Cleveland rallied for the win. The loss snapped a five-game winning streak for Boston (36-16), which has the best record in the majors. Cleveland (32-19), with the AL's second best record, avoided being swept in the three-game series. Boston led 2-0 after four innings, but Cleveland tied the game in the fifth and went ahead 6-2 in the sixth against Daisuke Matsuzaka (7-3). Byrd (6-1) has gone six games since his last walk. Royals 3, Orioles 0 Erik Bedard won a matchup of staff aces with Gil Meche and Nick Markakis hit a two-run homer, leading visiting Baltimore to its fifth straight victory. Bedard (4-3) went a season-long eight innings and gave up only four hits, with five strikeouts and two walks. Chris Ray pitched a perfect ninth for his 12th save. Meche (3-4) allowed one run in 7 1-3 innings as Kansas City lost its seventh straight.

(AP) - Jeremy Guthrie wasn&#39;t trying to insult the hapless Kansas City Royals. He was only being honest. "I was missing up, I was throwing breaking balls down. I was up and down and all over the place except where I needed to be," the Baltimore starter said. "Today was a tough day." But fortunately for him, anyone facing Kansas City these days hardly needs his best stuff. A scuffling Guthrie and two relievers combined on a three-hitter last night and led the Orioles to a 6-2 victory, handing the frustrated Royals their sixth straight loss. Guthrie (3-1) went seven innings, and then Chad Bradford and Chris Ray each pitched a scoreless inning of relief. The Royals held a hitters-only meeting before the game - only to have their bats collapse again. In this six-game slide, they&#39;re hitting only .193 and have been outscored 51-14, and manager Buddy Bell is sounding as if he&#39;s out of patience. "It&#39;s time we quit giving the other guys a whole lot of credit," Bell said. "Guthrie had a good fastball. Our swings in this ballpark are a little longer than on the road, for whatever reason." Ramon Hernandez drove in two runs for the Orioles, who won their fourth in a row after losing four of five. "Tonight, I battled through almost every inning, except maybe the seventh and first," said Guthrie, who gave up three hits, with one walk and three strikeouts. Jorge De La Rosa (4-5) gave up eight hits and five runs in five-plus innings. He was relieved after Kevin Millar and Melvin Mora reached beginning the sixth. The Royals took their first lead in a game since Saturday when Mark Teahen homered with two outs in the first. But the lead lasted only until Baltimore scored two in the second on Millar&#39;s solo home run and Hernandez&#39;s RBI single. Hernandez, who hit a grand slam Monday night, also singled home a run in the sixth as the Orioles notched their fourth four-game winning streak. Manager Sam Perlozzo said Guthrie gave him no argument when he pulled him. "He persevered," he said. "There were a couple of innings he just couldn&#39;t get any sink. But he went out and pitched. He was mentally exhausted trying to get back in gear and when he was done, he was done." Shane Costa, placed in the leadoff spot for the first time this year, drove in the Royals&#39; second run with a sacrifice fly in the third. Back-to-back doubles by Miguel Tejada and Aubrey Huff put the Orioles on top 3-1 in the third. With no outs in the sixth, Hernandez grounded a single off reliever Jimmy Gobble just past the outstretched glove of Angel Berroa, making his second start at shortstop. Millar easily scored from third, and Mora raced home from second when left fielder Costa short-hopped the throw into the infield, KC&#39;s first error in six games. Hernandez went to third on Brian Roberts&#39; single and scored when Nick Markakis grounded back to Gobble, who failed to field the ball cleanly and tried an underhanded scoop to the plate that was too late to get the runner. The play was ruled a fielder&#39;s choice. "We caught a break on both those plays," Perlozzo said. Notes: The start of the game was delayed 26 minutes by rain. ... The Orioles committed their league-leading fifth balk.

Hewitt the comeback king Hewitt took almost three hours to defeat former French Open champion Gaston Gaudio [GALLO/GETTY] Lleyton Hewitt came from two sets down to defeat 2004 champion Gaston Gaudio 4-6, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 in a gruelling five-set match in the third round of the French Open on Thursday. Hewitt's stunning comeback victory was the fourth time in his career, and the second time in successive Grand Slams, that he has performed such a turnaround. "He's one of the toughest second round draws you can get here," Hewitt said of his opponent. "At the end of the second set, I was just trying to focus on the third. I wasn't even thinking about the fourth or fifth sets. I needed to keep my focus. "You never know what you are going to get with him. He has ups and downs. I had to make sure that I didn't have any of those downs. "But he's a great shotmaker. I just had to hang in there and try and take my chances when they came up." While the Australian looks forward to a third round clash against Finland's Jarkko Nieminen, the result looks likely to hasten the 28-year-old Gaudio's decision to ponder retirement. "I'm getting used to such a frustrating experience," he said. "I served well in the first two sets. "But he broke my serve in the third game of the third set and after that I couldn't play anymore." The Argentinian, who has slipped to 72 in the world after once reaching as high five, had already expressed his frustration at life on the tour after a dismal 2007 where he has only once won two matches in a row. Hewitt looked destined to suffer his worst performance in Paris since making a first round exit on his debut in 1999 when he went two sets down, with the first going for 62 minutes. The Australian failed to convert any of his four break points before Gaudio, who beat compatriot Guillermo Coria in a memorable five-set 2004 final, soon took a two-set lead. However if anyone was going to stage a comeback, it was Hewitt, and the 14th seed cut back on unforced errors in the third set which he took with breaks in the third and seventh games and then levelled the contest against a ragged Gaudio by snatching the fourth as the Argentinian's game imploded. Hewitt broke in the first and fifth games of the deciding set and took the match with a love service game after three hours and 28 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier when Gaudio hit a lazy, tired forehand long. Hewitt had to come back from two sets down to beat Michael Russell in the first round of this year's Australian Open. His first such dramatic recovery came against Guillermo Canas in the fourth round at Roland Garros in 2001, and the second was in 2003 when he beat Roger Federer in a Davis Cup semi-final.

Click me to Kobe Bryant asks to be traded from Lakers NBA star Kobe Bryant has reportedly asked the Lakers to be traded. Photograph by : CP File Photo John Nadel, The Canadian Press Published: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 LOS ANGELES â€” Kobe Bryant asked to be traded from the Lakers on Wednesday, a day after calling the teamâ€™s front office â€œa mess.â€ He said there was nothing the Lakers could do to change his mind. â€œI would like to be traded, yeah,â€ Bryant told ESPN radio. â€œTough as it is to come to that conclusion, thereâ€™s no other alternative. Itâ€™s rough man, but I donâ€™t see how you can rebuild that trust. I just donâ€™t know how you can move forward in that type of situation.â€ Bryant, who helped the Lakers win three consecutive NBA championships, has four years left on the seven-year, US$136.4-million contract he signed July 15, 2004. That was a day after Shaquille Oâ€™Neal was traded to the Miami Heat. Bryant became infuriated Tuesday when a Los Angeles Times columnist quoted what he called a Lakers insider as saying it was Bryantâ€™s insistence on getting away from Oâ€™Neal that prompted the trade to Miami. Bryant, the NBAâ€™s leading scorer the past two seasons, said he spoke with Phil Jackson on Tuesday, and the coach told him he was being let go because the Lakers were committed to reducing payroll and rebuilding long-term. â€œThey said nothing to me about a long-term plan â€” absolutely nothing,â€ Bryant told KLAC radio, the Lakersâ€™ flagship station. â€œThey told Phil one thing and they told me another. Actions speak louder than words.â€ â€œItâ€™s a trust thing,â€ he added. â€œTheyâ€™re in a long-term plan that I had no idea about.â€ Bryantâ€™s agent, Rob Pelinka, did not respond to several messages left by The Associated Press. Bryant, an 11-year veteran who turns 29 in August, urged the team at seasonâ€™s end to do what it takes to get back into contention. He essentially repeated those comments last weekend in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. On Sunday, he suggested former Lakers general manager Jerry West should return. West left the team in the summer of 2000 and was succeeded by current GM Mitch Kupchak. West, an employee of the Lakers for about 40 years as a player, coach and executive, is under contract as the Memphis Grizzliesâ€™ president until July 1. He turned 69 this week and has remained a close friend of Kupchakâ€™s. West has said he has â€œno plans to seek employment with any other organization.â€ It was West who brought Bryant to the Lakers, trading centre Vlade Divac to Charlotte in the summer of 1996 for the rights to Bryant â€” the 13th pick in the NBA draft. Bryant was only 17 at the time. On Tuesday, Bryant did a series of radio interviews bashing the Lakers. He contended owner Jerry Buss misled him three years ago, saying the team would try immediately to rejoin the NBAâ€™s elite. â€œThat place is a mess,â€ Bryant said, referring to the Lakersâ€™ front office. â€œIf weâ€™re not making strides here to improve this team right now, to be aggressive in that nature, then whatâ€™s the point of having me here?â€ The 74-year-old Buss was arrested Tuesday in Carlsbad for investigation of driving under the influence of alcohol. He was released later in the day. Bryant earned $17.72 million last season and is owed $88.6 million over the next four years. He can terminate his contract following the 2008-09 season â€” a move that would leave $47.8 million on the table. By requesting a trade, Bryant would obviously waive his no-trade clause, but he has a trade clause in his contract that is believed to add about $13 million to his total contract value, a cost to be absorbed by any team that acquires him. That money would be paid like a signing bonus and would not count toward the salary cap. The Lakers had to pay a similar fee to Lamar Odom when they acquired him from Miami three years ago, paying him about $8 million. The Lakers won championships from 2000-02 and reached the NBA final again in 2004, losing to the Detroit Pistons in five games. The team was broken up at that time. Oâ€™Neal was traded, Jackson left and other stalwarts â€” Karl Malone, Gary Payton, Derek Fisher, Robert Horry and Rick Fox â€” went elsewhere or retired. The Lakers failed to make the playoffs the following season. With Jackson returning before the 2005-06 campaign, they finished seventh in the Western Conference in each of the past two years, but were eliminated by Phoenix in the first round of the playoffs. The Lakers appeared to be a title contender through the first half of this season, going 26-13 despite several injuries to key players. But they lost 27 of their last 43 games to finish 42-40 before losing to the Suns in five games. â€œPersonally for me, itâ€™s beyond frustration â€” three years and still being at ground zero,â€ Bryant said a day after the playoffs ended. â€œThis summerâ€™s a big summer. We have to see what direction we want to take as an organization and make those steps and make them now.â€ Bryant has made the all-star team in each of the past nine seasons, clearly establishing himself as an NBA great before age 30. Only one active NBA player, Kevin Garnett, has a longer tenure with one team than Bryant. Garnett has played 12 seasons for Minnesota. The Lakers won 20 playoff series from 2000-04 but have won four post-season games and no series in the past three years. Since Oâ€™Neal left, theyâ€™ve received little from the draft, trades or free agency. Bryant has stated repeatedly in the past that he was a Lakersâ€™ fan since childhood, and wanted to be a Laker for life. But the Oâ€™Neal matter and his feeling of being misled by Buss appear have changed things. â€œThe fact of the matter is that many people donâ€™t know what really went down when I was approaching free agency because I have stayed quiet about it this whole time,â€ Bryant wrote on his website. â€œThe real facts are that Dr. Buss requested a meeting with me during the â€™04 season long before I opted out of my contract, and he told me he had already decided not to extend Shaq, as he was concerned about Shaqâ€™s age, fitness and contract demands. â€œDr. Buss made it clear that his decision was final, his mind was made up, and no matter what I decided to do with free agency, he was still going to move Shaq.â€ Oâ€™Neal said on the Philadelphia Inquirerâ€™s website he believed Bryant â€œ100 per cent.â€ Bryant said he was considering signing with the Clippers and Chicago Bulls three years ago before hearing from Buss. â€œDr. Buss promised me he would rebuild right away, and I believed him,â€ Bryant wrote. â€œThat is why I put my trust in the Lakers. But when stuff like this is coming from the `inside,â€™ all I can do is hope that someone from the `insideâ€™ comes forward to support me and set straight the facts of what really happened.

The Cards will try to tie the four-game midweek series at two wins each in Thursday nightâ€™s finale. In his first-ever MLB start, (0-0, 2.70 as a Card) bested former Houston Astro (2-4, 4.30) on Wednesday night as the 21-29 Cards halted the Rockies' seven-game winning streak and their own three-game skid. Hereâ€™s how they did it. was hit by a pitch and failed to convert with one out in the top of the first inning. However, did not let Hirsh off the ropes. His two-out double into the left field corner scored Taguchi. The rattled rookie uncorked a wild pitch with his very next offering, as finally one of â€™s wild swings did some good, as all the wildness enabled Pujols to dash in from third. Leading off for the Rockies, former Met reached base and promptly stole second, as scorched a ball that almost took Wellemeyerâ€™s head off to put runners on the corners. Matsui scored on a 4-6-3 twin killing to cut the lead to 2-1 Cards. The Cardsâ€™ lead was short-lived as blasted a solo home run into the right field seats to tie the game in the second. The same Rockies keyed a two-out threat in the third. Tulowitzki shot another screamer past Wellemeyer for a single. A hit and run single by Hawpe put runners at the corners. That set the table for , who was retired on a fly ball to left. In the fourth, Edmonds collected a leadoff standup triple as the veteran centerfielder dove and missed his sinking liner. As the ball rolled to the wall, I thought the Edmonds of old might have circled the bases. The next pitch was turned into a one-hopper off the wall in left center â€“ an RBI double by Scott Rolen to retake the lead. The Cards batted around in the fifth. Miles and Taguchi both singled to lead off the inning. Pujols slammed his ninth home run of the year to dead center on the first pitch of his at-bat. Edmonds put the very next offering into the bullpen in right. The pair of 400-plus-foot home runs made the score 7-2. Encarnacion hustled a double to left center with one down. â€™s blast up against the wall. It was just a few feet from being a two-run home run. The Rox gambled by walking Kennedy with first base open, but Wellemeyerâ€™s RBI single blew up the strategy and ended Hirshâ€™s night. He was charged with all eight runs. Matt Holliday homered to start Coloradoâ€™s fifth, which ended Wellemeyerâ€™s night. He allowed three runs on seven hits in five-plus innings. After took over for the seventh. A RBI double charged to Franklin closed the gap to 8-4. Franklin was asked to pitch a second inning, which may or may not have future rotation implications. Holliday singled with one out in the eighth. A wild throw by Kennedy pulled Miles off the second base bag on Heltonâ€™s grounder, so instead of an inning-ending double play, two runners were on. Franklin fanned Atkins before came in to face Hawpe, who took Ryen Ludwick to the wall in right for the catch. That would be the Rockiesâ€™ last threat of the evening. A forgotten man in this series so far, Jason Isrnghausen, closed out the Rockies in the ninth in order. It was a non-save situation. - Closing out the four-game series Thursday night, (3-1, 4.73) faces Aaron Cook (4-1, 4.11). The Cards have their work cut out for them as Cook hasnâ€™t lost in his last seven starts. - With the win Wednesday, the Cardinals took a 68-67 lead over the Rockies in career head-to-head games. The Cards are 34-36 lifetime at Coors Field. - When the big boys hit, the Cards win. Simple as that. The former â€œMV3â€ went 7-for-14 with a walk in Wednesdayâ€™s victory. - Albert Pujols went 2-for-4 with three RBI and two runs scored, including a home run. His average is back up to .296. - Scott Rolen had three hits in Tuesday nightâ€™s game and two more Wednesday. He has hits in seven straight and nine of his last ten contests. His average has climbed to .252 since he started the last homestand on the 22nd at .209. - Jim Edmonds hit his fourth home run in five starts Wednesday night and has had at least one hit in 11 of his last 16 games. Edmonds went 3-for-5 on the evening. - I donâ€™t want to get the cart ahead of the horse, but I have to admit that the photo of Wellemeyer above sort of reminds me of another journeyman and ex-Cubs reliever, turned effective starter in St. Louis, then turned into trade bait. I am talking about Kent Bottenfield. See any resemblance? Maybe time will tellâ€¦ Brian Walton can be reached via email at brwalton@earthlink.net. Â© 2007 stlcardinals.scout.com. All rights reserved.

Samuel Pahlsson's goal in the 3rd period was all Anaheim needed in the 1-0 win. Late in the third period Ducks forward Samuel Pahlsson pounced on a neutral zone turnover, raced into the Senators zone and, using Ottawa blueliner Joe Corvo as a screen, fired a hard shot that beat Sens goalie Ray Emery to the stick side for the winner.

Rob Niedermayer, Teemu Selanne, Corey Perry and Ryan Getzlaf had three or more shots. Their checking forwards, particularly Pahlsson and Niedermayer, did a terrific job defensively in shutting down the Senators forwards for the second straight game. Anaheim's blueliners used their physical advantage to once again neutralize the Senators' scoring forwards at even strength, particularly by clearing rebounds and blocking shots. Chris Pronger, Scott Niedermayer and Francois Beachemin again logged big minutes and were instrumental in keeping the Senators off the board. Of the four times the Ducks were penalized, only one was assessed to a defenseman (Pronger), indicative of the more-disciplined effort by their defensemen in shutting down their opponents. For the second straight game, Jean-Sebastien Giguere wasn't tested very much, facing only 16 shots, but came up big on the few scoring chances the Senators had on him. The Ducks again failed to score on the power play but their penalty killers were more effective in this game by shutting down Ottawa's power play. They also outdrew the Senators in the faceoff circle 30-21. Samuel Pahlsson, for both his superb job in checking Ottawa's top line as well as scoring the game's only goal. The only minor point in an otherwise superb performance by the Ducks is their continued inability to score on the power play, but if they keep playing as well throughout the remainder of the series as they did in Game 2, it probably won't matter. For the second straight game, the Senators top line of Daniel Alfredsson, Jason Spezza and Dany Heatley were unable to score. In fact, this was unquestionably that line's worst performance of the playoffs. They got no help from their secondary scorers. Ottawa's forwards keep losing the battles along the boards, failed to generate enough scoring pressure on the Ducks and appeared unable to drive to the net against the Ducks physical defense. They again failed to get the puck deep into the Anaheim zone and win the footraces to the pucks. For the second straight game the Senators blueliners struggled against the physical forechecking of the Ducks, coughing up the puck, failing to clear their zone or generate breakout passes, or win the battles along the boards and in front of their net. Offensively they were unable to get enough pucks through on their point shots. If not for Ray Emery, the Senators would've been blown out of the building. He again faced lots of rubber, stopping 30 of 31 shots, and had no chance on the Pahlsson goal, as he was screened by his defenseman. He did his best for the second straight game to give his team a chance to win. Their penalty killing remains one of their few bright spots in this series, effectively killing off four Anaheim power plays. Their own power play, however, came up snake eyes in this game. Everywhere except in goal and on the penalty kill. The Ducks dominated the Senators, who actually played worse in this game than in Game 1. They can't use the long layoff prior to this series as an excuse for this stinker. They played more physically in this game, but they came up short everywhere else. The Ducks have taken away Ottawa's speed advantage and if they can't regain it as well as improve the rest of their game, this series could be a short one.

A-Rod makes himself heard Johnny Damon is greeted by Alex Rodriguez after leading off the game with a home run. A-Rod later found himself in the middle of another controversy. (MIKE CASSESE/REUTERS) By Associated Press | Alex Rodriguez helped the New York Yankees end their five-game losing streak with his bat -- and his mouth. Rodriguez distracted Toronto third baseman Howie Clark on a key popup late in the game, touching off arguments all over the field, and the Yankees beat the Blue Jays, 10-5, last night in Toronto. Rodriguez hit an RBI single with two outs in the ninth that made it 7-5. Jorge Posada followed with a high infield pop and Rodriguez ran hard, cutting between Clark and shortstop John McDonald. Replays showed Rodriguez shouting something, and Clark backed off at the last second. McDonald was only a few steps behind Clark, but couldn't make the catch and the ball dropped for an RBI single. "I just said, 'Hah!' That's it," Rodriguez said. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't." McDonald started jawing with Rodriguez, and third base umpire Chad Fairchild got between them. Toronto manager John Gibbons came out to argue and exchanged words with Rodriguez and third base coach Larry Bowa before leaving the field as plate umpire Eric Cooper intervened. Rodriguez stayed on the bag with a smirk. When Jason Giambi stepped up to hit, he seemed to get into it with catcher Jason Phillips and Cooper settled them down. Giambi followed with a two-run single. When the game ended, many of the Blue Jays stayed on the bench, staring at Rodriguez and the Yankees. "They have their opinions," Rodriguez said, adding he pulled the trick to help the Yankees "win a game. We're desperate." Rodriguez said three or four times each week, opponents shout at him while he pursues foul pops near their dugout. "It's not like he said, 'I got it,' " Yankees manager Joe Torre said. Johnny Damon led off with a home run for the Yankees, who avoided falling nine games under .500 for the first time since they were 20-29 after play June 20, 1995, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. New York took a quick lead against rookie Jesse Litsch (1-2), scoring five times in the first inning. Yankees rookie Tyler Clippard (2-1) gave up three runs and four hits over five innings. Angels 8, Mariners 6 -- Vladimir Guerrero hit a go-ahead, three-run homer and Francisco Rodriguez notched his 18th save in 19 chances for host Los Angeles. Devil Rays 5, Tigers 3 -- James Shields (4-0) settled down after a shaky first inning to throw the second complete game of his career, and Elijah Dukes and Brendan Harris backed the righthander with solo homers for host Tampa Bay. Orioles 3, Royals 0 -- Erik Bedard won a matchup of staff aces with Gil Meche and Nick Markakis hit a two-run homer, leading Baltimore past host Kansas City for the Orioles' fifth-straight win. Athletics 6, Rangers 1 -- Dan Haren (6-2) won his sixth straight decision and Dan Johnson drove in three runs for host Oakland. Phillies 4, Diamondbacks 3 -- At Philadelphia, 43-year-old Randy Johnson (4-3) returned from tendinitis to toss one-hit, shutout ball over six innings, and Eric Byrnes homered twice to lead Arizona to its seventh straight win. Former Seattle teammates Johnson and the 44-year-old Jamie Moyer (5-4) combined to set a record for the matchup of the oldest lefties in history. At a combined 88 years 90 days, Johnson and Moyer broke the record set the last time these two faced off in early May. Braves 9, Brewers 3 -- Brian McCann hit a go-ahead, three-run double in a seven-run eighth inning, and Atlanta sent host Milwaukee to its seventh loss in eight games. Reds 4, Astros 3 -- Aaron Harang (6-2) pitched a six-hitter for his first complete game of the season, and Cincinnati handed host Houston its 10th consecutive loss. Dodgers 5, Nationals 0 -- Derek Lowe (5-5) pitched seven scoreless innings, reached base three times, and scored once as Los Angeles shut out host Washington for the second straight game. Marlins 9, Cubs 0 -- Dan Uggla homered twice, and Miguel Cabrera and Josh Willingham went deep to lead Florida at Chicago. Giants 3, Mets 0 -- Barry Zito (5-5) outpitched Tom Glavine (5-3) over seven sharp innings and San Francisco snapped a four-game losing streak with a win at New York. Cardinals 8, Rockies 4 -- Todd Wellemeyer earned a victory in his first major league start and Albert Pujols and Jim Edmonds hit back-to-back homers in the fifth to help St. Louis end host Colorado's seven-game winning streak.

Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Bedard throws down aces as Orioles win By DOUG TUCKER AP Sports Writer Article Launched: 05/30/2007 09:35:48 PM PDT Click photo to enlarge Baltimore Orioles' Nick Markakis watches his ball after hitting a two-run home run during the ninth inning of a baseball game against the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday, May 30, 2007, in Kansas City, Mo. The Orioles won 3-0, sweeping the Royals in a three-game series. KANSAS CITY, Mo.- Giving up only eight earned runs in his previous 34 innings hadn't produced a win, so Erik Bedard took the next logical step. He didn't give up any runs at all. Outpitching Kansas City's Gil Meche, Bedard allowed four hits in eight innings Wednesday night and led Baltimore to a 3-0 victory, the fifth straight win for the Orioles and the seventh loss in a row for the hapless Royals. "It's always tough when it's 0-0 late in the game," Bedard said. "But you just stay in there and battle and good things will happen." Winless since April 18, Bedard (4-3) had five strikeouts and two walks in his longest outing of the season. Only one runner got past second against the left-hander. Jay Payton broke up the scoreless duel with an RBI single in the eighth and Nick Markakis, inserted into right field for defensive purposes, hit a two-run homer in the ninth off Zack Greinke. Meche (3-4) bounced back from his worst outing of the year to throw one of his best games since joining Kansas City. "Gil was terrific," said Royals' manager Buddy Bell, who was ejected in the top of the eighth for arguing with Marty Foster after the home plate umpire had thrown out Emil Brown for arguing a called third strike. "It's hard to win when you don't score any runs," Bell said. "He gave us what we needed, but we couldn't do anything with Bedard." After matching Bedard with seven shutout innings, Meche departed when Payton grounded an RBI single through the hole into left with one out in the eighth. The right-hander gave up four hits and one run in 7 1-3 innings. He walked four and had five strikeouts after allowing seven runs and 11 hits in 4 1-3 innings his previous start. "Coming out of a slump against Bedard is not an easy thing to do," Meche said. "He just beat us." Chris Ray pitched a perfect ninth for his 12th save in 15 chances. Rain delayed the game at the start 1 hour, 36 minutes, then the pitchers did their best to get the fans home quickly. The game took 2:31. It had been so long since his last win, Bedard said he couldn't remember when it happened. "I know it was a long time ago," he said. But frustration, he added, is "part of the game." "It happened the first two years. It happened last year. It happens every year," he said. "You go through a span where you don't win for four or five games in a row, then you win five in a row. It's part of the game." Ramon Hernandez walked leading off the eighth for the Orioles, whose five-game winning streak is their longest of the season. Corey Patterson was safe at first when he laid down a bunt and beat the throw to the bag. The runners moved up on Brian Roberts' sacrifice bunt, and then Payton's single broke the scoreless tie. Greinke came in for Meche and struck out the next two batters, Miguel Tejada and Aubrey Huff, on six pitches, but surrendered a single to Kevin Millar ahead of Markakis' home run. Meche's lower back had tightened up in his previous start, rendering him ineffective. But facing a Baltimore lineup which had scored 31 runs and hit .315 while winning four in a row, he was dominant for seven innings. Mora singled leading off the second, then the right-hander retired 16 in a row before walking Roberts to lead off the sixth. The seven-game skid is the longest of the year for the Royals, who again have reclaimed the worst record in the majors. In getting swept three games by the Orioles, the Royals managed only three runs and 12 hits. They now begin a seven-game road trip to Tampa Bay and Cleveland. "They're all frustrated," Bell said of his players. "And I'm right there with them." Notes:@ Baltimore LHP Jamie Walker was passing out cigars celebrating the birth of his fourth child. He'd been away for two days to be with wife Natalie. ... Bell hadn't been thrown out of a game since April 9 at Toronto.

The best minutes of the meeting occurred soon after Barry Zito had banked the Giants' 3-0 win over Tom Glavine and the Mets. Zito, a couple of weeks past his 29th birthday and now the winner of 107 games, was asked whether he could relate to the 41-year-old Glavine's 295. "I have to relate to his big-league service time first," said Zito, grinning. "That's a long run, man. He's been on the field and staying healthy forever. "The wins are impressive and amazing, but if you can stay healthy that many years and compete, my hat's off to him." Across the bowels of the ballpark, Glavine's hat also came off. "He pitches," Glavine said of Zito, that starkest of compliments which is the highest praise inside clubhouse walls. "He changes speeds and locations. He isn't a guy who is overpowering, but those are the guys I love to watch. "I just wish I didn't have to watch him against me." From everywhere except possibly the Mets' dugout, the view was impressive, as Zito pitched the first seven innings of the first shutout of the Mets in 56 games, since Sept. 26, 2006. When Zito became a free agent in October following a 102-63 run in Oakland, many assumed his rock-star bearings would lead him to New York. This was a place, they reasoned, where he would enjoy pitching. Well, no kidding. ... Wednesday night brought his first opportunity to pitch in Flushing, and he certainly appeared to enjoy the occasion. Showing up the Mets, however, was not part of his agenda. The Mets' offseason pursuit ended with their decision that the left-hander did not merit the $126 million price (over seven seasons) eventually paid by the Giants. "I don't want to pitch with any vendetta," said Zito, slowly shaking his head. "For me, it's just being aggressive and throwing strikes and hoping for the best." Zito even enjoyed the pregame as much as the game. Running around in the outfield before entering the bullpen to warm up, he received the verbal bouquets of Mets fans. "It's always great to come to New York and get all those trash-talkers who were on me in the outfield today," Zito said, "saying everything they could think of. "No, they weren't creative at all. Just throwing blatant expletives right at me." Soon enough, Zito was throwing quality stuff at those fans' heroes. Enough quality stuff to bar Glavine's road to 296, and to leave his elder shrugging shoulders in resignation. In the aftermath, Glavine was cornered into explaining defeat. But he hadn't lost; allow three runs in seven innings, and you've done a job worthy of a "W." Except, Zito wouldn't let him win. Glavine retraced a maddening first inning of one line-drive hit to the outfield -- by Barry Bonds, which the pitcher degraded to "semi-line drive to the outfield" -- and a couple of others dribbled through the infield, including a two-run single by Pedro Feliz. Feliz's single was huge, and effectively brought the night to a premature conclusion. Because, San Francisco's pitcher is a walking contradiction to that romantic notion that baseball games slowly build toward climax. Glavine's rationale -- "I'm always going to give up runs, so I just got them out of the way earlier" -- was sound, with one major exception. Zito simply does not surrender leads. Not even modest ones. In 50 starts since the beginning of the 2005 season, he now is 33-4 when given at least two runs. Which Feliz's roller under shortstop Jose Reyes' diving glove did. "I had to make those early runs work," Zito said. "I knew Glavine has been tough." Indeed, if not for tough luck, Glavine wouldn't have any luck at all. At his current pace, he will participate in one memorable game after another, while remaining stuck on 295 wins. In his previous start, he had dropped a 2-1 gem to John Smoltz, his onetime swing man on the Braves posse. Now this whitewash by Zito, one of the worthy successors to the left-handed throne he occupies. "Maybe," Glavine said, those ground hits still bouncing around in his mind, "I've got to get them to hit the ball harder." Satisfaction in one room, frustration in the other ... and nothing but admiration down the middle. It was a remarkable evening, when one remembers that Glavine won his first of 295 when Zito was a nine-year-old in third grade. On Wednesday night, the generations fused into a remarkable duel. Glavine is chasing 300, and Zito may never get too far on the other side of 200. The hill is just too steep, the way his craft has changed. But for one night, at least, they were peers. And as a tandem, they were peerless. is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.

Belisle (5-4) allowed only two hits after Adam Everett's RBI triple that was nearly an inside-the-park homer. Belisle, a native of Austin, threw 102 pitches in 7 2/3 innings, his longest outing since a complete-game victory over Pittsburgh on April 28. Adam Dunn knocked in a run with a sacrifice fly for the Reds, who won on the road for the third time in their last 12 games away from home. David Weathers got Carlos Lee to ground into a game-ending double play with the bases loaded in the ninth to pick up his 10th save. Jason Jennings gave up three hits with three strikeouts in his first start for Houston since April 8. Jennings was on the disabled list with tendinitis in his right throwing elbow. Chad Qualls (4-2) replaced Brad Lidge to start the seventh and took the loss. The Astros have lost nine in a row for the first time since September 1996. They lost to the Reds for just the third time in 10 meetings. Craig Biggio doubled with two outs in the second and scored the Astros' only run. Everett hit a sinking liner to center and the ball skidded past Norris Hopper when he couldn't make a diving catch. Hopper chased down the ball and hit Brandon Phillips with a relay throw as Everett rounded third. The throw home to Chad Moeller was high, but the catcher swiped the sliding Everett for the out at the plate. Jennings retired nine in a row after giving up three hits and walking two in the first two innings. He struck out Moeller and Belisle to end the fifth and was finished after 79 pitches. Rick White relieved to start the sixth and gave up a double to Hopper and a single to Hatteberg. Left-hander Trever Miller came on and walked Ken Griffey Jr. to load the bases. Lidge, who hadn't pitched since bruising his knee in San Francisco on May 21, replaced Miller and struck out Phillips. Dunn then flew out to deep center to score Hopper and tie it at 1. With one out in the eighth, Hatteberg hammered Qualls' 2-0 pitch into the Astros' bullpen in right center. It was Hatteberg's fifth homer of the season and his second in three days. He hit career homer No. 100 against Pittsburgh on Saturday. Diamondbacks 11, Phillies 5: PHILADELPHIA - Orlando Hudson had four hits and drove in four runs, Micah Owings pitched five effective innings Tuesday night to lead Arizona over Philadelphia 11-5, the Diamondbacks' sixth straight victory. Pirates 4, Padres 1: PITTSBURGH - Tom Gorzelanny scattered seven hits over seven innings to lead Pittsburgh, which won for the fourth time in five games. Gorzelanny (6-3), who gave up one run, entered the game third in the NL with a 2.51 ERA. He lowered that to 2.39. Dodgers 10, Nationals 0: WASHINGTON - Brad Penny scattered four singles over 6 1/3 innings and Juan Pierre had a career-high four extra-base hits for Los Angeles. Red Sox 4, Indians 2: BOSTON - Josh Beckett returned from the disabled list to win his eighth consecutive decision, pitching seven innings of three-hit ball to lead Boston to a 4-2 victory over Cleveland on Tuesday night. Blue Jays 3, Yankees 2: TORONTO - New York's losing streak reached five as Alex Rios hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the eighth inning for Toronto. New York (21-29) has lost 13 of 18 and dropped a season-high 14 1/2 games behind first-place Boston in the AL East. The Yankees are tied for last in the division with Tampa Bay. Tigers 14, Devil Rays 2: ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - Gary Sheffield homered twice and drove in five runs, and Jeremy Bonderman won his fourth straight start for Detroit. Sheffield's 34th multihomer game helped the Tigers stop a four-game losing streak. He has 467 homers, moving him past Dave Winfield into sole possession of 29th place on the all-time list. Orioles 6, Royals 2: KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Jeremy Guthrie pitched seven strong innings and Ramon Hernandez drove in two runs as Baltimore handed Kansas City its sixth straight loss. Twins 9, White Sox 2: MINNEAPOLIS - Justin Morneau homered and drove in four runs for Minnesota in its third straight win.

After catching a shutout for the second consecutive night, Martin was barely asked about the two-run homer he slugged in support of Derek Lowe's 5-0 win over the Nationals on Wednesday night. When the questioning implied that the Dodgers can't be an elite team with a "weak" offense, Martin politely dissented. "If you say it like that, yeah, I'm part of that offense, so I take it a little personally," he said. "It's not just our pitching that's winning games. Pitching has held us together this year, but we've got guys that have hit for a lot of years. I don't think that's a problem here. I've got lot of confidence in our hitters. We're going to be OK. "People can say whatever they want, but we're a good hitting team. We don't have that one big power hitter -- a [Albert] Pujols or a Ryan Howard -- but we've got guys who can hit 20 homers. Add them up and we've got some power." Martin's fourth homer of the year cleared the center-field fence. He hit 10 last year while spending the first month of the season in the Minor Leagues. "The most I've ever hit are 15, but I've got the power to hit home runs," Martin said. "It's an approach. I'm sure I could hit more, but my average (.303) would drop more. It's just hitting them when you need to." Luis Gonzalez, whose six home runs are second to Jeff Kent's eight, had a pair of hits and scored the Dodgers' first run. "We're starting to swing the bats well throughout the lineup," Gonzalez said. "Everybody critiques about our power outage, but we have guys that put the ball in play and make things happen. Our two leadoff hitters on top create havoc for the other team and open holes for the rest of us hitters. We have professional hitters up and down. When they put this team together, they knew what they were getting. We may not look like superstars, but we grind it out and play hard." Of course, there's always the pitching. Lowe allowed three singles over seven innings, and the only Nationals baserunner to reach second base did so on an error. Following Brad Penny's 10-0 victory the previous night, Lowe and relievers Joe Beimel and Rudy Seanez pitched the Dodgers to consecutive shutouts for the first time in exactly three years (May 29-30 against Arizona). Penny and Lowe have not been scored upon in each of their last two starts covering 26 1/3 innings. Randy Wolf has allowed two runs in his last two starts (13 innings). Jason Schmidt could return from the disabled list in a week to 10 days, further strengthening the rotation. Lowe came away from this a .500 pitcher (5-5), and talk about a deceptive record. In his five losses, the Dodgers have scored only seven runs. Now in his five wins, he's allowed only six earned runs. He has eight quality starts in 12 outings and his ERA is down to 3.32. He's allowed only two home runs compared to 14 last year. Despite that, Lowe said this one was "a struggle." He walked two, but went deep enough in counts to throw 112 pitches. "I've pitched better this year and not gotten as good results," Lowe said. "The defense played extremely well, Nomar [Garciaparra] made four or five tremendous plays. Russell stayed with me and did a good job of coaxing me through it. Early on, my stuff wasn't there and I had to grind it out. The outs weren't coming easy. "In games like this, it's good that it was zero-zero for so long [through four innings] because it made me concentrate harder on every single pitch. As the game went on, it seemed to get better. The offense gave me a big lift with the four runs." Following Penny's 2-for-2 night at the plate, Lowe also got involved in the offense with a single and a pair of walks, prolonging the two-run fifth inning with one of them off Mike Bacsik and starting the seventh-inning rally with the other, then scoring on Garciaparra's single off the foot of pitcher Saul Rivera. "There's a lot of pressure on Mark tomorrow. Hopefully he can get his first hit of the year," Lowe said of Thursday night starter Mark Hendrickson. Garciaparra, whose home run drought reached 146 at-bats, fielded five balls hit his way, robbing Nook Logan of extra bases in the second inning and likely saving the shutout. So what if the Dodgers cannot trade for a power hitter between now and the trade deadline? Will it be enough to load up on pitching and create runs any which way? "Absolutely," said Lowe. "It's National League baseball, pitching and defense wins. And last year, Penny didn't start a game in the playoffs. Look at the way he's pitching, who would want to face him?

CARUSO Associated Press Writer &copy; 2007 The Associated Press NEW YORK &mdash; The days of seeking out ticket-scalpers in the shadows, ducking into alleys and dodging police for that elusive Yankees-Red Sox seat are fading fast. New York is poised this week to become the latest state to ease or eliminate decades-old restrictions on scalping. For the first time, it would become entirely legal in the state for average fans to scalp their seats on the Internet. And, for better or worse, they could sell those tickets at what ever price the market is willing to bear. The state assembly approved the changes Tuesday. The Senate is expected to follow suit, and Gov. Eliot Spitzer could sign the measure by Friday, when the state's old anti-scalping law expires. "If you have something to sell, you should be able to sell it for what it is truly worth," said Sean Pate, spokesman for the online ticket broker StubHub Inc., which lobbied hard for the change. Some old regulations would stay in place. Scalpers would still be banned from selling tickets within 1,500 feet of large arenas, like Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium, and within 500 feet of smaller venues. Large-volume brokers would still need to get a license, too. It's those brokers who have Russ Haven of the New York Public Interest Research Group worried. Haven argues that lifting the price caps will only prompt greedy opportunists to snap up every available seat, and then jack up prices. "I think this is a bum deal for consumers," Haven said. "As it is, seats to popular events are often selling for 10 times their face price." "It may be that there will be some portion of tickets that go for less than face value, but that's not what they're all banking on," he said of the brokers and ticket agencies pushing for change. Other states have also reconsidered anti-scalping laws. Minnesota tossed its old anti-scalping laws this spring. The state previously allowed tickets to be resold only at face value. A bill that would ease Missouri's ban on selling tickets to sporting events at more than face value passed the legislature and is now before the governor. Illinois and Florida also recently did away with old anti-scalping rules, and bills to ease restrictions are under discussion in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The shift has been propelled in part by the explosion of Internet ticket sales that has made it nearly impossible for states to enforce price caps. New York's old rule limiting a seller's profits to no more than 45 percent over face value has been widely ignored online. But perhaps the biggest change was a switch in business strategy by some of the sports and entertainment companies that previously fought scalping the hardest: Realizing that a multibillion-dollar market was being left untapped, a growing number of teams and theaters have been entering the secondary ticket market themselves. The NCAA signed a deal last year to resell tournament tickets through RazorGator.com. The NBA and some NFL teams have made Ticketmaster their official reseller under an agreement that gives teams a percentage of the profit when a seat is resold. "There is obviously a business opportunity here for us," said Ticketmaster vice president Joseph Freeman. Yet to be seen is how much control sports teams, theaters and concert halls will retain over the tickets being resold. Some have pushed for legislation that would limit reselling to venue-approved brokerages, in part to cut down on the possibility of fraud. Both the New York Yankees and their archrival Boston Red Sox recently made a practice of cracking down on season ticket holders caught selling their unwanted seats on the Internet, in violation of team policy. New York's new rules, if signed in their current form, would actually ban New York sports teams from taking such punitive action. "My feeling is, if I have a ticket, and I can't go to a ballgame, I should certainly have a right to give it to my brother or my cousin &mdash; and if they want to pay me for it, why should I have to go through the Yankees to do it?" state Sen. Dean G. Skelos said.

Give the Gift of SI Faces in the Crowd Grizzlies hire Iavaroni as new coach Posted: Wednesday May 30, 2007 3:31PM; Updated: Wednesday May 30, 2007 3:31PM By Jack McCallum, SI.com have hired Phoenix assistant Marc Iavaroni as their new head coach, SI.com has learned. An official announcement is expected Thursday. Iavaroni was widely considered to be the Grizzlies' top choice after nothing came out of an early interview between the club and Larry Brown. Iavaroni and Dave Griffin, the Suns' vice president, were considered to be a package deal, but the Grizzlies had not hired Griffin for a front-office role as of Wednesday morning. The Suns reportedly want Griffin to stay on through the draft, which might discourage Memphis' interest in him as it tries to replace team president Jerry West, who will leave at the end of June. Iavaroni was schooled in the control system of Pat Riley in Miami, where he was an assistant coach, and is widely recognized as a defensive specialist, though Iavaroni has said he has come to appreciate the up-tempo offense run by Suns coach Mike D'Antoni.

NEW YORK - Barry Zito had the New York Mets on his short list when he was looking at teams as a free agent in the offseason. He opted for a big deal with the San Francisco Giants, insisting it was nothing personal. He sure looked composed against the Mets on Wednesday night, outpitching Tom Glavine over seven sharp innings to help the Giants snap a four-game losing streak with a 3-0 victory. â€œI donâ€™t really want to pitch with any kind of vendetta against people,â€ Zito said of facing New York. â€œYou know for me itâ€™s just about being aggressive and throwing strikes and hope for the best.â€ Pedro Feliz drove in three runs and Rich Aurilia tied a career high with four hits for the Giants, who bounced back from a difficult loss in the series opener against New York. The Mets won 5-4 in 12 innings Tuesday night when Armando Benitez balked in the tying run and surrendered a game-ending homer to Carlos Delgado. â€œThatâ€™s a tough one, losing in extra innings, especially when you have the lead,â€ Giants manager Bruce Bochy said, â€œand to bounce back, play well, get a win, thatâ€™s huge for the club.â€ Paul Lo Duca had two hits for New York, which had won four straight. It was the first time the Mets had been shut out this season. Glavine went seven innings but was denied in his second attempt at career win No. 296. â€œIt was just a streak of bad luck early in the game,â€ Glavine said. Lo Duca led off the seventh with a double for his 1,000th career hit but Zito retired the next three batters, striking out pinch-hitter Julio Franco to end the inning. Zito (5-5) turned in his second consecutive strong outing after struggling in back-to-back starts earlier this month. He gave up 13 runs and 12 hits in 10 innings in outings at Colorado and Oakland, then allowed one run in seven innings in a win over Houston in his last start. Zito, who beat the Mets for the second time this season, said he tried to be too fine against Oakland. â€œYouâ€™ve just got to throw at these guys and be aggressive in the zone, let them get themselves out instead of trying to be too perfect,â€ said Zito, who left the Athletics for a $126 million, seven-year deal with San Francisco. â€œThatâ€™s kind of been my approach the last couple days.â€ He struck out a season-high seven against the Mets, holding them to six hits and one walk. Jack Taschner tossed a perfect eighth and Brad Hennessey got three outs for his second save. Barry Bonds returned to the lineup for the Giants, went 1-for-3 with a walk and remains 10 shy of breaking Hank Aaronâ€™s career record of 755 homers. He was booed lustily each time he came to the plate. Bonds entered with a .329 batting average and four homers in 100 career plate appearances against Glavine, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He hit a two-out single to center against him in the first inning to put runners on first and second. After Bengie Molina walked, Feliz grounded a two-run single into left field. Slide show: Week in Sports Pictures Week in Sports Pictures Sports fans riot and show their elfin side, while flips, turns and wipeouts punctuate motor sports this week. â€œYouâ€™ve got to be very patient,â€ Bonds said about facing Glavine. â€œThe bottom line is if youâ€™re not patient, heâ€™s going to kill you. But if he makes a mistake, Iâ€™m going to kill him. If he doesnâ€™t make a mistake, heâ€™s going to win.â€ Bonds bounced into a double play in the third before Molina singled to right to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. Feliz then tripled off the wall in right-center to make it 3-0. Glavine (5-3) intentionally walked Bonds in the fifth and got him to groundout to first to end the seventh on his 122nd and final pitch of the game. He allowed nine hits, walked two and struck out four. â€œI thought he pitched pretty well,â€ Mets manager Willie Randolph said. â€œThey found some holes. We felt we could score some runs but once Zito got in a groove it was tough.â€ Mets reliever Guillermo Mota was activated after serving the 50th and final game of his suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance. He relieved Glavine to start the eighth and received a mixed reaction of boos and cheers from the home crowd. â€œIt was nice to be back,â€ said Mota, who threw two scoreless innings Giants SS Omar Vizquel made two slick, barehanded plays in the first four innings. ... The Mets optioned RHP Ambiorix Burgos to Triple-A New Orleans to make room for Mota on the roster. ... Philadelphia, Detroit and Baltimore are the only three teams in the majors that havenâ€™t been shut out this season. ...

DUBLIN, Ohio - Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus were side by side on the practice range Wednesday, the two most prolific major champions in golf who looked nothing alike except for the sweat pouring off their faces on a steamy day at Muirfield Village. Nicklaus was warming up for the pro-am, the closest he gets to competition these days. Woods was shaking off rust as he tries to win for the fourth time this year, with one eye on the U.S. Open in two weeks. There are amazing parallels in their careers, from green jackets at Augusta National to the two claret jugs at St. Andrews. They were the youngest of their eras to complete the career Grand Slam. Both were 30 when their fathers died, and both went on to win the British Open that summer. Perhaps the most glaring difference was their rivals. Nicklaus had rivals with staying power that stretched over two decades, from Arnold Palmer to Gary Player, Lee Trevino to Tom Watson. Woodsâ€™ rivals seem to come and go like fashion trends â€” David Duval in 1999, Phil Mickelson in 2001, Ernie Els in 2002, Vijay Singh in 2004, nobody in 2000. After his pro-am round at the Memorial, Woods recalled talking to Nicklaus about rivalries. â€œHe said that as long as youâ€™re part of the conversation over 20 years,â€ Woods said with a smile, â€œthen youâ€™re doing all right.â€ Mickelson has joined the conversation again. A week after Woods won the Wachovia Championship, Mickelson won The Players Championship. They are 1-2 in the world ranking and on the PGA Tour money list. Both return to action this week at the Memorial, which has a 107-man field with the focus squarely on two players. â€œHeâ€™s playing better, no doubt about that,â€ Woods said. Mickelson has 31 victories on the PGA Tour â€” no one has more among active players except Woods â€” and now is working with Butch Harmon, the celebrated swing coach who refined and then retooled Woodsâ€™ swing at the start of his career. Of all the rivalries Woods has faced, this is the most natural, even he says that his biggest rival is himself. Slide show: Week in Sports Pictures Week in Sports Pictures Sports fans riot and show their elfin side, while flips, turns and wipeouts punctuate motor sports this week. â€œI keep pushing myself pretty hard regardless,â€ he said. â€œI always try and get better. You canâ€™t stay stagnant in any sport. Youâ€™ve always got to keep getting better, because you know the guys are training harder; theyâ€™re refining their game.â€ Asked about their renewed rivalry, Mickelson said it was flattering. â€œTo me, anyway,â€ he quickly added. â€œProbably not to him, but itâ€™s flattering to me.â€ Mickelson began working with Harmon right before the Byron Nelson Championship at the end of April, and the results have been on the upswing. He was third at the Nelson, third at Wachovia and won The Players. With the U.S. Open approaching, former U.S. Open champion Johnny Miller gives Mickelson the edge.

Baseball roundup: Tuesday's action on the diamonds Baseball roundup: Tuesday's action on the diamonds May 30, 2007 - 1:16 Pittsburgh Pirates' Freddie Sanchez, right, is tagged out by San Diego Padres second baseman Oscar Robles as he tries to advance to second after hitting an RBI single in the third inning. (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic) (CP) - Jason Bay followed up his award-winning week with another big game. Hours after being named the National League's player of the week, the native of Trail, B.C., had two hits, including his eighth homer, in the Pittsburgh Pirates' 4-1 win over the San Diego Padres on Tuesday. It was Bay's hit his third homer in his past five games. He's 12-for-24 with three home runs and 11 RBIs in his past seven games. And with the Pirates winning, his recent excellent play means that much more. "A lot of times in the past you go on a little hot streak, and it doesn't mean as much because you're not winning," Bay said. "This has coincided with us winning so I think it means a little bit more." Elsewhere in the NL it was: Arizona 11 Philadelphia 5, Los Angeles 10 Washington 0, New York 5 San Francisco 4 (12 innings), Florida 9 Chicago 4, Cincinnati 2 Houston 1, Milwaukee 5 Atlanta 4 and Colorado 8 St. Louis 3. At Pittsburgh, Tom Gorzelanny lowered his ERA to 2.39 after overcoming a shaky first inning. Bay acknowledged that the left-hander is Pittsburgh's leader on the mound. "I'm not going to say he came out of nowhere," Bay said, "but he's our bona fide guy right now. He's our stopper. It's nice to have that guy that goes out there every single day and you're thinking he's going to throw a gem and give you a chance to win." Josh Bard went 3-for-4 and Jose Cruz had two hits for the Padres, who had won three in a row and six of seven. Gorzelanny (6-3) scattered seven hits while allowing the one run, striking out four and walking three as the Pirates won for the fourth time in five games. Gorzelanny allowed only eight earned runs in his six starts in May. "I'm still a long ways from being established," said Gorzelanny, who is in his second full season in the majors. "And I'm just going to go out there, do my thing, work hard. I know there's still a lot of things I have to work on, especially with my pitch count." That negative aspect of his game was on display in the first inning, when Gorzelanny threw 34 pitches and loaded the bases before escaping unscathed. "He showed tremendous signs of a very mature guy out there," Pirates manager Jim Tracy said. "In the first inning of the game it looks like 'How far are we going to be able to get with him with 34 pitches in the first inning?' He just kept battling. This guy finds ways. "He kept getting better as the night goes on." The only run he allowed was a sacrifice fly by Termel Sledge that scored Kevin Kouzmanoff in the sixth. Other than the first inning, he twice stranded runners at second base. The last batter Gorzelanny faced was Adrian Gonzalez, with a runner on and two outs in the seventh. Gorzelanny struck him out with his 120th pitch. "You've got to give credit to their guy," San Diego manager Bud Black said. "He wobbled a little bit but made a couple of pitches that get them out of the inning. A hit in that inning with a couple of guys on would have been nice but Gorzelanny hung in there and made some pitches. "I can see why this guy has a two-and-a-half ERA, he's got good stuff. He's got a lot of things going for him." Jose Bautista helped the Pirates take an early lead against David Wells. He singled and scored on Xavier Nady's single in the first, and doubled and scored on Freddy Sanchez's single in the third to make it 2-0. Wells (2-3) allowed two runs and eight hits in five innings, walked one and struck out two. The Padres have scored only seven runs in his past four starts. Diamondbacks 11 Phillies 5 At Philadelphia, Orlando Hudson had four hits and drove in four runs while Micah Owings pitched five effective innings to lead Arizona over the Phillies. Dodgers 10 Nationals 0 At Washington, Brad Penny scattered four singles over 6 1-3 innings and Juan Pierre had a career-high four extra-base hits for Los Angeles. Mets 5 Giants 4 (12 innings) At New York, Carlos Delgado hit his second homer of the game for the Mets moments after Jose Reyes provoked excitable San Francisco reliever Armando Benitez to balk home the tying run in the 12th inning. Marlins 9 Cubs 4 At Chicago, Jeremy Hermida hit a tiebreaking three-run homer in the fifth inning and Josh Willingham added a three-run double in the eighth to lead Florida. Reds 2 Astros 1 At Houston, Scott Hatteberg hit a solo home run in the eighth and Matt Belisle struck out a career-high eight for Cincinnati, which handed the Astros their ninth consecutive loss. Brewers 5 Braves 4 At Milwaukee, Ben Sheets brushed off a poor first inning to get the win and Prince Fielder hit his NL-leading 17th homer for the Brewers, who snapped a six-game losing streak by beating Atlanta. Rockies 8 Cardinals 3 At Denver, Yorvit Torrealba hit a grand slam and Rodrigo Lopez struck out a season-high seven in six innings as Colorado won its seventh straight. The New York Yankees are finding new ways to lose as they suffer through a crippling slump. Aaron Hill stole home, sliding in safely ahead of Andy Pettitte's throw in the seventh, and Alex Rios had a go-ahead sacrifice fly to help the Toronto Blue Jays beat New York 3-2 Tuesday night. "It seems like we're losing every way possible and tonight was no different," Johnny Damon said. The Yankees (21-29) have lost five straight and 13 of 18 to fall eight games under .500 for the first time since they were 11-19 on May 6, 2005, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. "You can envision us struggling, just not this long," Derek Jeter said. "Every team scuffles at times but we've been scuffling for a long time now." Boston's 4-2 victory over Cleveland on Tuesday dropped the Yankees a season-high 14½ games behind the Red Sox in the AL East. "It's certainly not getting any easier for us," manager Joe Torre said. "We just have to keep plugging. It's a mountain to climb right now." Elsewhere in the AL it was: Boston 4 Cleveland 2, Detroit 14 Tampa Bay 2, Baltimore 6 Kansas City 2, Minnesota 9 Chicago 2, Texas 4 Oakland 0 and Los Angeles 4 Seattle 1. At Toronto, Adam Lind led off the eighth with a double off Pettitte, went to third on a sacrifice and scored on Rios' fly ball to centre off reliever Scott Proctor. Proctor threw his glove in the dugout after getting the final out of the inning. Pettitte (3-4) allowed three runs and six hits over 7 1-3 innings. He struck out three and walked one. "He's not getting any support from us right now and neither are any of our other pitchers," Damon said. Jeremy Accardo (1-0) pitched 1 2-3 innings for the win. Hill's steal in the seventh gave the Blue Jays a 2-1 lead. Singles by Frank Thomas and Hill put runners at first and second with one out. Jason Phillips then grounded to third baseman Alex Rodriguez, who stepped on the bag to force out Thomas. Rodriguez threw to first to try to retire Phillips, who collided with Josh Phelps as the throw arrived, knocking the ball loose and allowing Hill to advance to third. With the count 1-1 to Royce Clayton, Hill took a walking lead, then broke for the plate. Facing away, Pettitte didn't notice until catcher Jorge Posada stepped out and waved his right arm. Pettitte threw home but Hill slid in safely ahead of the tag. "I saw him running right away," Posada said. "I stood up and was screaming but obviously the fans were screaming too." Pettitte said he hesitated for a split second because he thought the umpire had called a balk. "I didn't feel like I hesitated for that long for a guy to be able to steal home on me," Pettitte said. "He must have been a way off third base. Unless I'm losing my mind, I thought the umpire threw his hands up in the air, too. I'm not real sure. "To be out of the stretch, what can you say? That's embarrassing." Hill said third base coach Brian Butterfield told the Blue Jays before the game that Pettitte was vulnerable to a steal of home. "I definitely felt my heart beating," Hill said. "I've never done it before and I didn't know what was going to happen. I just pictured the umpire calling me safe to hopefully give me a little better boost." It was Toronto's first steal of home since Shea Hillenbrand did it Aug. 6, 2005, against the Yankees. "I didn't think you could lose an American League ballgame like that," Pettitte said. "Every little thing is costing us games and we're not doing a whole lot to get it done." New York went 1-for-7 with runners in scoring position, and is 1-for-13 in its past two games. "We're just not swinging the bats," Jeter said. "We sprinkle hits here and there but we're just not getting the job done." Torre said the losing streak has left his team feeling tense. "Everybody seems to want to do it themselves and you can't do it that way," Torre said. "We need to have a game where we can have a little fun. We haven't been able to do that and it's based on the fact that we seem to keep fighting uphill all the time." Red Sox 4 Indians 2 At Boston, Josh Beckett returned from the disabled list to win his eighth consecutive decision, pitching seven innings of three-hit ball to lead the Red Sox to a victory over Cleveland. Tigers 14 Devil Rays 2 At St. Petersburg, Fla., Gary Sheffield homered twice and drove in five runs, and Jeremy Bonderman won his fourth straight start for Detroit. Orioles 6 Royals 2 At Kansas City, Mo., Jeremy Guthrie pitched seven strong innings and Ramon Hernandez drove in two runs as Baltimore handed the Royals their sixth straight loss. Twins 9 White Sox 2 At Minneapolis, Justin Morneau of New Westminster, B.C., homered and drove in four runs for Minnesota in its third straight win. Rangers 4 Athletics 0 At Oakland, Calif., Sammy Sosa lined a two-run single that got by charging left fielder Shannon Stewart, breaking a scoreless tie in the sixth and helping Texas end a season-worst six-game losing streak. Angels 4 Mariners 1 At Anaheim, Calif., Ervin Santana allowed one run over seven innings and Shea Hillenbrand hit a two-run homer as Los Angeles beat Seattle.

Giants 3, Mets 0 NEW YORK (AP) -Barry Zito had the New York Mets on his short list when he was looking at teams as a free agent in the offseason. He opted for a big deal with the San Francisco Giants, insisting it was nothing personal. He sure looked composed against the Mets on Wednesday night, outpitching Tom Glavine over seven sharp innings to help the Giants snap a four-game losing streak with a 3-0 victory. ''I don't really want to pitch with any kind of vendetta against people,'' Zito said of facing New York. ''You know for me it's just about being aggressive and throwing strikes and hope for the best.'' Pedro Feliz drove in three runs and Rich Aurilia tied a career high with four hits for the Giants, who bounced back from a difficult loss in the series opener against New York. The Mets won 5-4 in 12 innings Tuesday night when Armando Benitez balked in the tying run and surrendered a game-ending homer to Carlos Delgado. ''That's a tough one, losing in extra innings, especially when you have the lead,'' Giants manager Bruce Bochy said, ''and to bounce back, play well, get a win, that's huge for the club.'' Paul Lo Duca had two hits for New York, which had won four straight. It was the first time the Mets had been shut out this season. Glavine went seven innings but was denied in his second attempt at career win No. 296. ''It was just a streak of bad luck early in the game,'' Glavine said. Lo Duca led off the seventh with a double for his 1,000th career hit but Zito retired the next three batters, striking out pinch-hitter Julio Franco to end the inning. Zito (5-5) turned in his second consecutive strong outing after struggling in back-to-back starts earlier this month. He gave up 13 runs and 12 hits in 10 innings in outings at Colorado and Oakland, then allowed one run in seven innings in a win over Houston in his last start. Zito, who beat the Mets for the second time this season, said he tried to be too fine against Oakland. ''You've just got to throw at these guys and be aggressive in the zone, let them get themselves out instead of trying to be too perfect,'' said Zito, who left the Athletics for a $126 million, seven-year deal with San Francisco. ''That's kind of been my approach the last couple days.'' He struck out a season-high seven against the Mets, holding them to six hits and one walk. Jack Taschner tossed a perfect eighth and Brad Hennessey got three outs for his second save. Barry Bonds returned to the lineup for the Giants, went 1-for-3 with a walk and remains 10 shy of breaking Hank Aaron's career record of 755 homers. He was booed lustily each time he came to the plate. Bonds entered with a .329 batting average and four homers in 100 career plate appearances against Glavine, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He hit a two-out single to center against him in the first inning to put runners on first and second. After Bengie Molina walked, Feliz grounded a two-run single into left field. ''You've got to be very patient,'' Bonds said about facing Glavine. ''The bottom line is if you're not patient, he's going to kill you. But if he makes a mistake, I'm going to kill him. If he doesn't make a mistake, he's going to win.'' Bonds bounced into a double play in the third before Molina singled to right to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. Feliz then tripled off the wall in right-center to make it 3-0. Glavine (5-3) intentionally walked Bonds in the fifth and got him to groundout to first to end the seventh on his 122nd and final pitch of the game. He allowed nine hits, walked two and struck out four. ''I thought he pitched pretty well,'' Mets manager Willie Randolph said. ''They found some holes. We felt we could score some runs but once Zito got in a groove it was tough.'' Mets reliever Guillermo Mota was activated after serving the 50th and final game of his suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance. He relieved Glavine to start the eighth and received a mixed reaction of boos and cheers from the home crowd. ''It was nice to be back,'' said Mota, who threw two scoreless innings Notes: Giants SS Omar Vizquel made two slick, barehanded plays in the first four innings. ... The Mets optioned RHP Ambiorix Burgos to Triple-A New Orleans to make room for Mota on the roster. ... Philadelphia, Detroit and Baltimore are the only three teams in the majors that haven't been shut out this season. ... Mets 2B Jose Valentin (knee) went 3-for-5 with a walk in an extended spring training game in Port St. Lucie, Fla.

But after watching his team's latest debacle -- a 7-6 loss at Minnesota in which the Sox blew a five-run lead, extended their losing streak to four games and dropped to the .500 mark for the season -- he hinted that changes could be looming. "If we have to shake up this ballclub, we will," Guillen declared after watching reliever David Aardsma walk Torii Hunter on four pitches with two outs and the bases loaded in the ninth inning. "At least Kenny Williams will," he said of the general manager. "I'm sitting here and watching since July of last year to right now, the same &#091;stuff&#093;. If I'm going to get fired, good. If this team's going to get better with me out of here, I'll be happy. But as long as I'm here, we have to play better." Williams will have plenty to assess after concluding a one-week trip to the minor leagues. More moves could be made to shore up the unreliable bullpen. In Wednesday's loss, slumping Mike MacDougal fueled the Twins' winning rally with a walk to Jason Tyner. Guillen pulled no punches after the Sox were swept at the Metrodome and outscored 26-12. He said the Twins made the Sox look "like Little Leaguers" and repeatedly used the word "embarrassing" to describe their play. "It's not early anymore," catcher A.J. Pierzynski said. "It's frustrating because we think we're a better team than this, that we're a better hitting team and a better pitching team. And we proved that we pitch at times and can hit at times." The Sox fell to 24-24 after Jon Garland walked a season-high five batters. Sox pitchers walked eight total, and five of them scored. Also, five of the Twins' seven runs came with two outs. Moreover, the once-dependable rotation has an 0-4 record and an 8.31 ERA in its last six starts. And the Sox lineup went hitless after the third inning. With each loss, the postgame mood has been quieter. "We've been winning a lot of series other than obviously this one, but it hasn't seemed like we've been winning a lot of games," Aardsma said. "We've been going out there and winning, but it doesn't seem like it because we always seem to leave ourselves down. We'll pull ourselves out of it, but we have to do it game-by-game." Before the game, Guillen said Darin Erstad, Jim Thome, Jermaine Dye and Paul Konerko were the only position players with secure spots in the lineup. He expanded the responsibility to the entire roster after the game. "I will take the blame like I always do," Guillen said. "In the meanwhile, the 25 guys we have, they had better look themselves in the mirror." Garland also absorbed his share of blame. "I absolutely &#091;stunk&#093;," he said, adding an off-color adverb for emphasis. "That's the only way to describe it." Guillen described his pregame session as a wake-up call. "If people think there are going to be trades here, they start playing better," Guillen he said. "If you're going to get traded, play better because they're not going to trade names, they're going to trade players to help someone else win." For the record, scouts from the San Francisco Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers watched the Sox during various stages of the three-game series at the Metrodome. But they also could have been looking at the Twins, who certainly outperformed the Sox in all categories. "They play as a team, they compete as a team, they get you as a team," Guillen said, reiterating his admiration for the Twins. "That's why they win, and that's why they have five or six division titles, because they earn it. Nobody gives it to them. "They deserve credit. They showed up and kicked us. If we continue to play like that, it's not only going to be the Twins, it's going to be everybody in the American League taking advantage of us."

http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/05/31/ap3772858.html&cid Bedard Throws Down Aces As Orioles Win - Forbes.com Bedard Throws Down Aces As Orioles Win 05.31.07, 1:27 AM ET Giving up only eight earned runs in his previous 34 innings hadn't produced a win, so Erik Bedard took the next logical step. He didn't give up any runs at all. Outpitching Kansas City's Gil Meche, Bedard allowed four hits in eight innings Wednesday night and led Baltimore to a 3-0 victory, the fifth straight win for the Orioles and the seventh loss in a row for the hapless Royals. "It's always tough when it's 0-0 late in the game," Bedard said. "But you just stay in there and battle and good things will happen." Winless since April 18, Bedard (4-3) had five strikeouts and two walks in his longest outing of the season. Only one runner got past second against the left-hander. Jay Payton broke up the scoreless duel with an RBI single in the eighth and Nick Markakis, inserted into right field for defensive purposes, hit a two-run homer in the ninth off Zack Greinke. Meche (3-4) bounced back from his worst outing of the year to throw one of his best games since joining Kansas City. "Gil was terrific," said Royals' manager Buddy Bell, who was ejected in the top of the eighth for arguing with Marty Foster after the home plate umpire had thrown out Emil Brown for arguing a called third strike. "It's hard to win when you don't score any runs," Bell said. "He gave us what we needed, but we couldn't do anything with Bedard." After matching Bedard with seven shutout innings, Meche departed when Payton grounded an RBI single through the hole into left with one out in the eighth. The right-hander gave up four hits and one run in 7 1-3 innings. He walked four and had five strikeouts after allowing seven runs and 11 hits in 4 1-3 innings his previous start. "Coming out of a slump against Bedard is not an easy thing to do," Meche said. "He just beat us." Chris Ray pitched a perfect ninth for his 12th save in 15 chances. Rain delayed the game at the start 1 hour, 36 minutes, then the pitchers did their best to get the fans home quickly. The game took 2:31. It had been so long since his last win, Bedard said he couldn't remember when it happened. "I know it was a long time ago," he said. But frustration, he added, is "part of the game." "It happened the first two years. It happened last year. It happens every year," he said. "You go through a span where you don't win for four or five games in a row, then you win five in a row. It's part of the game." Ramon Hernandez walked leading off the eighth for the Orioles, whose five-game winning streak is their longest of the season. Corey Patterson was safe at first when he laid down a bunt and beat the throw to the bag. The runners moved up on Brian Roberts' sacrifice bunt, and then Payton's single broke the scoreless tie. Greinke came in for Meche and struck out the next two batters, Miguel Tejada and Aubrey Huff, on six pitches, but surrendered a single to Kevin Millar ahead of Markakis' home run. Meche's lower back had tightened up in his previous start, rendering him ineffective. But facing a Baltimore lineup which had scored 31 runs and hit .315 while winning four in a row, he was dominant for seven innings. Mora singled leading off the second, then the right-hander retired 16 in a row before walking Roberts to lead off the sixth. The seven-game skid is the longest of the year for the Royals, who again have reclaimed the worst record in the majors. In getting swept three games by the Orioles, the Royals managed only three runs and 12 hits. They now begin a seven-game road trip to Tampa Bay and Cleveland. "They're all frustrated," Bell said of his players. "And I'm right there with them." Notes:@ Baltimore LHP Jamie Walker was passing out cigars celebrating the birth of his fourth child. He'd been away for two days to be with wife Natalie. ... Bell hadn't been thrown out of a game since April 9 at Toronto. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/nyregion/31albany.html&cid Albany Close to Agreement to Ease Ticket Resale Limits - New York Times Albany Close to Agreement to Ease Ticket Resale Limits Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 31, 2007 ALBANY, May 30 — Gov. and state lawmakers are close to reaching agreement on dismantling laws that limit the resale of tickets to musicals, plays, concerts and sports events, but concerns raised recently by the Yankees and Mets appear to have held up a final deal. Skip to next paragraph Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times Gov. Eliot Spitzer met publicly with legislative leaders Wednesday for the fourth time, seeking to resolve issues before the session ends June 21. The Democratic-led Assembly passed a bill on Tuesday rolling back scalping restrictions, and the Republican-led Senate is expected to approve the bill later this week. The governor has supported the idea but has stopped short of endorsing the bill, partly to give the Yankees and Mets time to argue their case, people involved in the negotiations said. “Ticket scalping laws historically have not worked,” the governor said at an appearance on Wednesday morning. “I think permitting a free market to work its magic there is the smart approach.” The measure was supported by Broadway theater owners, licensed ticket resellers and some stadium and arena owners, who said they were losing profits to brokers, individuals and Web sites that can resell tickets at far higher prices. Consumer advocates, however, have opposed the bill, saying it would cause prices to skyrocket. The Yankees and Mets have expressed concern that holders of season tickets would resell single tickets without authorization from teams. Assemblyman Joseph D. Morelle, a Rochester Democrat who sponsored the legislation, said the Yankees wanted to be the only ones allowed to resell tickets to their games, a provision aimed at stopping season ticket holders from selling their tickets on Web sites like Mr. Morelle said he rejected the idea of letting the Yankees be the only authorized seller of their tickets because it would have defeated the purpose of the bill. “It would be unfair for us to say that we’re freeing up the secondary market while allowing producers to restrict the primary market,” he said. Officials for the Yankees and Mets did not return calls for comment. On Wednesday, the governor and legislative leaders held their fourth public meeting in four weeks to negotiate a number of issues they want to resolve before the end of the session on June 21. While the tone was more cordial than at previous meetings, the issues remain unresolved, including a proposal to expand DNA collection to all felonies and misdemeanors. One exception appears to be a bill requiring testing of people indicted on rape or sexual assault charges. Assembly Speaker said Wednesday that he would allow the bill to come to the Assembly floor before the end of the session. That greatly improves the chance that it will become law. It is supported by the governor and the Republican-led Senate and has a majority of Assembly members as co-sponsors. Currently, a conviction is required to compel an H.I.V. test. The measure has been sharply contested by some Assembly Democrats who are concerned about the civil liberties ramifications of testing suspects prior to conviction. Others believe that rape victims could get a false sense of security if suspects in their attacks test negative for H.I.V. Assemblywoman Nettie Mayersohn, a Queens Democrat and the chief sponsor of the bill in the Assembly, said victims and their doctors should be the ones to decide. “This is a decision that should be made by the woman and not by the legislators in Albany,” she said in a recent interview. The governor also vetoed three bills on Wednesday, including one that would have required contractors to post the prevailing wage rates. Mr. Spitzer argued that contractors who obey the law would be subject to unnecessary paperwork while those who do not pay the prevailing wage now would probably simply ignore the new requirement. The ticket scalping bill would allow tickets to be resold for whatever amount the market would bear. The bill also includes protections against consumer fraud. Under the existing anti-scalping law, which expires in June, licensed ticket resellers may charge up to 45 percent above the face value of tickets for events at large arenas. That law makes an exception for venues with fewer than 6,000 seats, including most Broadway theaters, limiting resale of their tickets to no more than 20 percent, or $5 over face value, whichever is greater. Until recently, that exception was supported by the League of American Theaters and Producers , a Broadway trade organization, whose members felt that an unfettered market would cause prices to go beyond the reach of all but the wealthy. But last fall, the league quietly reversed its position, arguing to a state consumer protection board that prices would not skyrocket if the ban was lifted and that the rise of sites on the Internet had already made it impossible to enforce. Steve A. Malito, a spokesman for a trade organization of licensed brokers that had lobbied to lift the ban for years, said the theater league’s change of heart had been pivotal. “It would appear that they now agree that this ultimately benefits the consumers,” Mr. Malito said. “We’re thrilled that they’ve switched their positions.” Consumer advocates said they thought the league had other motives. “Clearly, they think they can benefit financially with the repeal of anti-scalping law,” said Russ Haven, the legislative counsel for the New York Public Interest Research Group , which has opposed the repeal. Broadway has toyed in recent years with different ways to prevent losing ticket sales to brokers, such as reserving a portion of tickets to every performance and selling them at the box office as “premium tickets.” (The top ticket price to “Jersey Boys” is $121.50; a premium ticket costs $351.50.) By eliminating the caps on ticket resales, Mr. Haven said, the Broadway lobby had signaled that it could no longer beat ticket brokers and scalpers and was joining them. To crack down on street scalpers, the new law does ban the resale of tickets within 500 feet of any venue with 5,000 or fewer seats and within 1,500 feet of larger venues. However, it would allow theaters to open their own resale offices within that zone. In a statement, Charlotte St. Martin, the league’s executive director, praised the anti-fraud provisions in the bill and “the new buffer zone in the theater district that will prevent illegal ticket scalping in front of Broadway theaters.” Campbell Robertson contributed reporting from New York City.

Editor of The Cincinnati Post Editor of The Kentucky Post Kentucky Post City Editor Who needs a bullpen? Starters on a roll as Reds win 3rd straight By C. Trent Rosecrans Reds starter Aaron Harang allowed only six hits in his complete-game performance Wednesday. His record is now 6-2. 6 pitches, then the old heave-ho Wednesday's game: Reds 4, Astros 3 Diamondbacks win duel of aging lefties A-Rod's bark bites Blue Jays Norris Hopper dives for home plate in front of Houston catcher Brad Ausmus with the eventual winning run in the sixth inning Wednesday night. Actress Ashley Judd kissed her husband, race car driver Dario Franchitti, after he threw out the ceremonial pitch. Following the seventh inning, Reds starter Aaron Harang told bench coach Bucky Dent - filling in for the ejected manager Jerry Narron - that he was going to finish Wednesday night's game with the Astros. It didn't matter that Harang had just given up his first two hits since the second inning and a run in the Astros' seventh inning. Wednesday night's game belonged to him. Harang gave up another run in the eighth, but retired the Astros in order in the ninth to give Cincinnati a 4-3 victory at Minute Maid Park. The Reds won their third game in a row and sent Houston to its 10th consecutive loss. Harang's outing was the third outstanding showing by a Reds pitcher in a row. Kyle Lohse started the run with a shutout against the Pirates on Monday, Matt Belisle went 7 2/3, allowing four hits and a run on Tuesday in Houston and on Wednesday, Harang allowed six hits and three runs (two earned) in his complete-game performance. None of the three walked a single batter in that stretch. "You want to do better than the guy the night before," Harang said. "We got on Belisle because he couldn't finish it off. It's been a fun time, we're throwing the ball well and rolling." Bronson Arroyo is next in line for the Reds against the 1-7 Woody Williams tonight. Williams' lone victory is against Cincinnati. The Astros are experiencing the malaise that had been infesting the Reds' clubhouse before the current mini-streak. Houston is one loss shy of the franchise record of 11 losses in a row set in August of 1995. The Reds, on the other hand, have won three in a row for the first time since the end of April and first day of May. Cincinnati's turned it around (for the time being, at least) with strong starting pitching and impressive defense, including a spectacular diving stop and throw by third baseman Edwin Encarnacion in the eighth inning. In the 12 games since Encarnacion was recalled from Class AAA Louisville, he has yet to make an error. "I try to do anything to help the team win games," said Encarnacion, who reached base twice Wednesday night on errors by Houston second baseman Craig Biggio. "That's one of the keys to win games, play solid defense and get good pitching." Another key has been good starts - in both the tops and bottoms of innings. Cincinnati leadoff man Norris Hopper has reached base in eight of his nine plate appearances since taking over the position for the injured Ryan Freel on Tuesday. Wednesday, Hopper led off the game with a double, which sparked a three-run outburst to give Harang a comfortable lead with which to work. Hopper then scored the eventual game-winning run in the sixth after he earned a two-out walk -his first walk of the season - and scored on shortstop Alex Gonzalez's double to make it 4-1. "I've been leading off all my life, so I'm pretty comfortable with that role," said Hopper. "With Gonzalez, (Ken) Griffey and (Adam) Dunn hitting behind you, if you get on base, you're going to score. So that's what I try to do. When you get on base, that puts a lot of pressure on the defense, and they've got to be on their toes. You never know when you're going to go for that (stolen) bag, or whatever." That's exactly why Harang was successful, catcher David Ross said. Harang allowed only two batters leading off an inning to reach base - Carlos Lee singled in the seventh and Biggio doubled to start the eighth. Both Lee and Biggio scored in those innings. "It's all about starting off innings, when you get the first batter out, it's a big load off your shoulders," Ross said. "That's when you can cruise a little bit. (Harang) seemed to get that first guy out every inning. It seems like in the past, when we're struggling, that leadoff guy gets on. Then the manager has a ton of things he can do, he can hit-and-run, he can bunt a guy over, he can send him. Then all the bloops we had, some of those are because we're holding the guy on first and it goes over the first baseman's head or something like that." That didn't happen against the Astros on Wednesday. After getting Biggio to lead off the game, Morgan Ensberg singled and then scored on Lee's two-out double. Harang retired right fielder Luke Scott to start the second before Adam Everett singled. Everett would be the last Houston base runner until Lee's seventh-inning single as Harang retired 14 Astros in a row. "You throw strikes and get ahead and good things happen," said Harang, who struck out seven batters. "I was throwing a pretty good sinker today and slider had a good, tight downward movement to it. I threw a couple of good changeups." Harang's gone eight or more innings in three of his last four starts and improved his record to 6-2 on the season. "That's why management was smart and locked him up for a bunch of years - they knew," Ross said of the off- season extension signed by Harang. "He's a good pitcher and he's not afraid. That's what I like, he doesn't change his game for a hitter. His game plan is to go after the zone, if you're going to beat him, you've got to go at him. He's a fun guy to catch because he's so aggressive." Pitching performances like that have also made it fun for the Reds - as has winning. Winning wasn't something the team didn't do much of this month, winning just nine games in May headed into the final day of the month. While still owners of the National League's worst record at 21-33, the Reds could move into a tie for fifth in the National League Central with Houston with a victory today and enter today 8½ games behind slumping Milwaukee. The Reds would also own a percentage-points lead over the Astros for avoiding the dubious title of the NL's worst team. "You can just tell the atmosphere in the locker room is way different than it was five days ago," said Hopper, whose average is up to .321. "Coming off a couple of wins, everyone's hustling and playing hard and that's all you can ask for." Search our site by keyword: Your Guide to the City: Letters to the editors The Enquirer.

http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/05/29/ap3768034.html&cid Pirates Win Behind Emerging Ace - Forbes.com Pirates Win Behind Emerging Ace 05.29.07, 11:57 PM ET Tom Gorzelanny overcame a shaky start and kept himself among the National League's ERA leaders. Gorzelanny, who entered the game third in the NL with a 2.51 ERA, lowered that number to 2.39 after overcoming a shaky first inning to work seven solid innings in the Pittsburgh Pirates' 4-1 victory over the San Diego Padres on Tuesday night . Pirates outfielder Jason Bay, who kept his own hot streak going with two hits, including his eighth homer, acknowledged that the left-hander is Pittsburgh's leader on the mound. "I'm not going to say he came out of nowhere," Bay said, "but he's our bona fide guy right now. He's our stopper. It's nice to have that guy that goes out there every single day and you're thinking he's going to throw a gem and give you a chance to win." Josh Bard went 3-for-4 and Jose Cruz had two hits for the Padres, who had won three in a row and six of seven. Gorzelanny (6-3) scattered seven hits while allowing the one run, striking out four and walking three as the Pirates won for the fourth time in five games. Gorzelanny allowed only eight earned runs in his six starts in May. "I'm still a long ways from being established," said Gorzelanny, who is in his second full season in the majors. "And I'm just going to go out there, do my thing, work hard. I know there's still a lot of things I have to work on, especially with my pitch count." That negative aspect of his game was on display in the first inning, when Gorzelanny threw 34 pitches and loaded the bases before escaping unscathed. "He showed tremendous signs of a very mature guy out there," Pirates manager Jim Tracy said. "In the first inning of the game it looks like `How far are we going to be able to get with him with 34 pitches in the first inning?' He just kept battling. This guy finds ways. "He kept getting better as the night goes on." The only run he allowed was a sacrifice fly by Termel Sledge that scored Kevin Kouzmanoff in the sixth. Other than the first inning, he twice stranded runners at second base. The last batter Gorzelanny faced was Adrian Gonzalez, with a runner on and two outs in the seventh. Gorzelanny struck him out with his 120th pitch. "You've got to give credit to their guy," San Diego manager Bud Black said. "He wobbled a little bit but made a couple of pitches that get them out of the inning. A hit in that inning with a couple of guys on would have been nice but Gorzelanny hung in there and made some pitches. "I can see why this guy has a two-and-a-half ERA, he's got good stuff. He's got a lot of things going for him." Jose Bautista helped the Pirates take an early lead against David Wells. He singled and scored on Xavier Nady's single in the first, and doubled and scored on Freddy Sanchez's single in the third to make it 2-0. Bay hit his third homer in his past five games to answer San Diego's run in the sixth - the first homer Padres reliever Cla Meredith had allowed in 21 appearances this season. Bay, who was named NL player of the week earlier Tuesday, is 12-for-24 with three home runs and 11 RBIs in his past seven games. "A lot of times in the past you go on a little hot streak, and it doesn't mean as much because you're not winning," Bay said. "This has coincided with us winning so I think it means a little bit more." Wells (2-3) allowed two runs and eight hits in five innings, walked one and struck out two. The Padres have scored only seven runs in his past four starts. "I would never point the finger at my teammates for a lack of run support because these guys are going out there ... trying to score," Wells said. "And that's all you can do. I threw the pitches so I'm the one to blame." The Pirates added an insurance run in the eighth against Kevin Cameron, the first run he allowed in 17 1-3 career innings. Adam LaRoche - who had three hits - singled in Bay. Salomon Torres pitched the ninth for his 12th save. Notes:@ San Diego 2B Marcus Giles was ejected by first base umpire Joe West before the bottom of the second began. Giles was called out on strikes by plate umpire C.B. Bucknor in the top of the inning on a ball that could have been low. ... Oscar Robles, Giles' replacement, was originally called out on a sinking line drive to left that television replays showed Bay trapped. After Black came out to argue the call, the umpires gathered and reversed it, giving Robles a single. Tracy then argued, to no avail. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Eliot L. Spitzer supports the measure. Click to view a larger picture State to end price cap on brokered tickets - NEWS ALBANY BUREAU Updated: 05/31/07 7:26 AM ALBANY &#8212; A measure ending current price caps on how much scalpers and brokers can charge on tickets to sports and entertainment events is moving toward final approval by state lawmakers and Gov. Eliot L. Spitzer. A day after the measure was overwhelmingly approved by the Assembly, the governor Wednesday added his voice of support to bring a free-market system to the booming business of ticket reselling that has been bolstered in recent years by an assortment of Internet sites. The Senate is expected to approve the legislation today. The measure, depending on which side is believed in the debate, will either end up cutting or sharply raising the price of tickets to sports, theatrical and entertainment events that are resold by individuals, scalpers and ticket reselling outlets, such as StubHub. &#8220;Competition means lower prices,&#8221; said Sen. Dean Skelos, a Nassau County Republican and sponsor of the bill likely to be approved today in the Senate. After an intense lobbying campaign, which featured the likes of everyone from eBay to the Buffalo Bills and New York Yankees and some of Albany&#8217;s most influential lobbying firms, the legislative agreement ends a longtime price cap that now prohibits resellers from charging more than 45 percent above a ticket&#8217;s face value for events in venues with more than 6,000 seats. The Assembly on Tuesday passed the bill, 102-34. Critics say the measure will open the floodgates to price gouging by scalpers and ticket resale companies. But promoters insist a free market system will keep ticket prices from going sky high and could, depending on supply and demand pressures, cut resale prices. The governor said the regulation has been difficult to enforce, especially with a booming ticket resale business on the Internet. Further, he said the law &#8220;doesn&#8217;t make sense&#8221; to apply price controls on the so-called secondary ticket market when there is no cap placed by the state on a ticket&#8217;s first point of sale by arena and theater box offices. The governor did not if he would definitely sign the legislation, but he made clear his support, calling it &#8220;smart judgment&#8221; to let the current limits expire. In a floor debate in the Assembly Tuesday, detractors said the measure will have one effect: higher ticket prices, especially on moderate-income families who already find themselves being priced out of the regular ticket market. It will lift the cap that now applies to an array of ticket resellers, from eBay listings to TicketExchange, the Bills&#8217; ticket resell program. Assemblyman Sam Hoyt, DBuffalo, said officials with the Buffalo Bills earlier had urged him to vote against the measure; he said the Buffalo Sabres had remained neutral on the bill. Citing the difficulties of the Buffalo Bills to flourish in a smaller NFL market city, Hoyt said he did not want to back any effort that could hurt the team. &#8220;I&#8217;m very cautious about supporting any measure that may in face impact the economic strength of a particular industry, especially in this case the Buffalo Bills,&#8221; he told his colleagues Tuesday. Hoyt later acknowledged the Bills may have softened earlier opposition with the introduction of some amendments to the measure. Officials with the Bills and Sabres declined comment Wednesday. Lawmakers from downstate, meanwhile, lamented the effect on families being able to afford Broadway plays and other cultural events. &#8220;I think this bill is a real mistake. I think the wrongs that it will do are not what are in the minds of the [bill&#8217;s] sponsors, but the wrongs that it will do are very much in the minds of those pushing this bill,&#8221; said Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, D-Manhattan. Supporters say New York &#8212; in the face of ticket resales from brokers in states with no price caps and an increasing number of Internet ticket sales outlets &#8212; has been unable to enforce its own price cap law. &#8220;Market restrictions by statute, I believe, are no longer applicable in this day and age,&#8221; said Assemblyman Joseph Morelle, a Rochester Democrat who sponsored the measure in the Assembly. The online company eBay, in a memo backing the bill, said current law prevents New Yorkers from buying tickets beyond the price cap. &#8220;Many New Yorkers are therefore unable to purchase tickets to their favorite sporting events, concerns or other large entertainment venues while non-New Yorkers can purchase the tickets without any restrictions,&#8221; the company&#8217;s lobbying memo said. It said the measure replaces a system with &#8220;an arbitrary price cap&#8221; to ticket sales led by &#8220;traditional market forces.&#8221; Current law includes two caps: the 45 percent above face value for events in venues with more than 6,000 seats and a 25 cap above face value for tickets to events in venues with fewer than 6,000 seats. The legislation also: &#8226; Ends current local government licensure of ticket resale brokers, placing the role under the state Department of State. Those selling fewer than five tickets per event are not considered brokers and don&#8217;t have to register. &#8226; Prohibits restrictions being placed on fans by the operators of venues, such as professional sports teams, involving such things as the sale of season tickets to resale companies. The Yankees last year moved against a number of season ticket holders who tried to resell tickets on StubHub. &#8226; Keeps intact a 1,500-foot buffer zone around large arenas, and sets a new, 500-foot buffer for venues with fewer than 500 seats, inside which ticket scalping is illegal. New York state&#8217;s big sports teams &#8212; including the Bills, Sabres, Rangers, Yankees, Knicks and Mets &#8212; opposed the measure a month ago over concerns involving a season ticket holder provision. The teams were concerned the bill would limit their ability to cut off a season ticket holder who engaged in illegal or fraudulent acts when reselling tickets, such as selling one ticket to two different buyers. Legislative sources said the Yankees also were pressing to ensure that only they could be the resellers of tickets to Yankees games. The final version makes clear that the ticket holder &#8212; not the team &#8212; has the say over how a ticket can be resold. But it also included an amendment giving teams authority to discipline ticket holders who abuse ticket reselling. On Saturday, the pro teams added their support to the bill and the Assembly quickly pushed the measure to the floor. The current ticket scalping law is set to expire Friday.

http://www.sbsun.com/sports/ci_6025537&cid San Bernardino County Sun - Lowe leads Dodgers to 2nd shutout Lowe leads Dodgers to 2nd shutout Tony Jackson, Staff Writer Article Launched: 05/31/2007 12:14:58 AM PDT WASHINGTON - If this wasn't Derek Lowe at his finest, then pity the Washington Nationals if they ever do run into the vintage version. On a Wednesday night when he couldn't locate his breaking ball, Lowe managed seven shutout innings and 11 ground-ball outs in a 5-0 victory over the Nationals in front of 22,360 at RFK Stadium. With that, the Dodgers assured themselves of winning a series for the first and last time in the three-year lifespan of this ballpark, where they will make their final appearance tonight. In winning the first two games, the Dodgers have outscored the Nationals 15-0, marking the first time they have turned in consecutive shutouts in three years. "The final line score looked good, but it didn't tell the whole story," Lowe said. "I was (behind in counts) 3-1, 2-0, and you're not going to win many games like that. But you just have to trust your stuff and feel like it's going to come around." By the time the Dodgers staked him to a 2-0 lead in the fifth - the second run scoring on an RBI single by Rafael Furcal to run his hitting streak to a career best-tying 15 games - it had come around for Lowe, who retired 13 of his final 15 batters while allowing just one hit, an infield single by Guzman in the fifth that could have been ruled an error on rookie third baseman Tony Abreu.

The offense couldn't get caught up in the intrigue of getting its first look at Japanese import Daisuke Matsuzaka and his six-pitch assortment. And in a crucial juncture of the ballgame in the bottom of the seventh, Aaron Fultz couldn't succumb to the pressure of pitching to David Ortiz with the bases loaded. Had the Indians faltered in either of those two segments, they might not have basked in the glow of an 8-4 victory in which they avoided a three-game sweep at the hands of the Red Sox and finished up a nine-game, three-city road trip with a 5-4 record. "The guys really played their tails off this whole trip," manager Eric Wedge said. "Those were three hard-fought games here. I thought we played good baseball here." But while the baseball might have been good, the Tribe's results the first two nights were far from satisfactory. So when Paul Byrd got the ball in opposition of Dice-K, Byrd knew it was an important start. "I think it means a little extra when you're trying to stop a slide," Byrd said. "And I think it means something extra when you're in first place and you have a team a game or two behind you. It's a little extra pressure." The Indians' lead in the American League Central is now 2 1/2 games over the Tigers -- their opponent this weekend at Jacobs Field -- in large part because of Byrd's efforts in the face of that pressure. Byrd won his fourth start in a row with another aggressive attack of the strike zone. He threw a first-pitch strike to 25 of the 27 batters he faced in six-plus innings, and, as has become the standard, he didn't walk anybody, running his streak without allowing a free pass to 43 innings. "He controlled the ballgame again," Wedge said of Byrd. "He made pitches when he had to and stayed away from the big inning." The Indians put together two big innings in support of Byrd -- one on the offensive end against Matsuzaka and the other when Byrd left behind a bases-loaded jam in the seventh. Dice-K was putting together an effective, if not efficient, outing against the Tribe through four innings of work. But the Indians erased a 2-0 deficit in the fifth to set up a sixth inning in which their bats, which had been downright stagnant the first two games of this series, really came alive. Trot Nixon opened the sixth with a double, and David Dellucci followed that one out later with a double of his own to drive Nixon in and give the Indians their first lead of the series, 3-2. "David had a big hit for us," Wedge said. "He's a guy I'm rooting for, and he's starting to come around." Dellucci came around to score on a Josh Barfield single that would have been a double, had Barfield not overrun second and got caught off the bag by Manny Ramirez's throw from left and Dustin Pedroia's phantom tag. No matter, though. With two outs, the Indians continued to unload with Kelly Shoppach's single and Grady Sizemore's two-run homer to right. Just like that, it was a 6-2 ballgame and Matsuzaka was gone. The Indians had been interested in seeing what a $103.11 million investment could buy, and they seemed to have no trouble adjusting to Dice-K's stuff. "We've all faced great pitchers many times," said Shoppach, who had a four-hit night. "With our offense, there's no giving in. We deserve a little bit of credit of putting our nose in there and getting after some tough pitches against a tough pitcher and chasing him out of there earlier than the last two guys [Curt Schilling and Josh Beckett]." The way Byrd was pitching, he didn't look as though he'd be chased early. He threw just 71 pitches through six innings, and he had what seemed to be a comfortable cushion. But in the bottom of the seventh, the Red Sox got to Byrd in the form of three straight singles with none out. Wedge yanked his starter and put in Tom Mastny, who wasted no time getting Coco Crisp to pop out into foul territory and striking out Kevin Youkilis. The biggest threat, though, was still looming in the form of Ortiz. While game-tying grand slams might not be an everyday occurrence, they seem to be a distinct possibility whenever Big Papi steps to the plate in such situations. This situation was placed in the hands of Fultz, who had struggled with his command throughout this road trip. "The one thing you have to do is slow the game down," Fultz said. "You take a deep breath and go after him." In a nine-pitch at-bat, that's just what Fultz did. And Ortiz nearly took him deep when he hammered a fastball down the right-field line. Fortunately for Fultz, it sliced foul. Fultz's next offering was a 2-2 curveball, and Ortiz lined it weakly to Casey Blake at third with the final out. "It wasn't a very good swing," Fultz said. "Anytime you can get a guy like that out and it's not a very good swing, that's good." The Indians, who pounded out a season-high 18 hits on this night, had to label this a good road trip, given that they're in a stretch of 20 games in 20 days and they swept the division-rival Tigers along the way. "We knew this was going to be a challenging stretch for us," Wedge said. "Our guys were up for it." is a reporter for MLB.com.

(AP) When a bouncing puck found Travis Moen in the slot, he was every bit as dangerous as Teemu Selanne, instead of the checker he's paid to be. Ottawa goalie Ray Emery can't stop a shot by Anaheim's Andy McDonald in first-period action of Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals on Monday. Anaheim won 3-2. Moen wasted no time and snapped a shot past Ray Emery with 2:51 left, giving the Ducks a 3-2 victory over the Senators in the Stanley Cup finals opener Monday night. Moen's fifth goal of the playoffs came after Ryan Getzlaf's tying goal 11:25 earlier erased the 2-1 lead Ottawa carried into the third period. Rob Niedermayer kept the play alive with a sweeping move behind the net, then nudged the puck in his checking linemate's direction. "It was kind of bouncing and I got lucky," Moen said. "I caught it on the way down, got a lucky shot and it went in. It was huge. "I think every kid dreams of scoring a goal to win a game in the Stanley Cup final." The 36-year-old Selanne, playing in the finals for the first time in his 14-year career, was goalless. He led Anaheim this season with 48 goals and 94 points. In the first matchup of the teams this season, Moen, along with Niedermayer and Samuel Pahlsson, held the Senators' top line of Daniel Alfredsson, Jason Spezza and Dany Heatley to two assists and handed Ottawa its first series-opening loss in these playoffs. Mike Fisher staked the Senators to a 1-0 lead in the first period with a power-play goal on Ottawa's first shot, and defenseman Wade Redden also scored on the man advantage in the second. Andy McDonald netted a goal in the first for the Ducks, who will look to take a 2-0 lead at home on Wednesday night. The Senators appeared ready to win their first Stanley Cup finals game since the franchise was reborn in 1992, but Anaheim fought back and stole it away. Ottawa lost only one game in each of its other three playoff series and now faces its first deficit. "I thought we came out pretty good the first 10 minutes," Heatley said. "After a layoff, you can't duplicate game situations. I don't think we're using it as an excuse, I just don't think we played up to our capabilities." Ottawa went without a shot from the 5:36 mark of the first until the end of the period and finished with three. "It's not so much what they did, it's what we didn't do as a line," Spezza said. "We didn't have as much jump." Jean-Sebastien Giguere made 18 saves overall to improve to 10-3 in the playoffs. Getzlaf's goal put the Ducks in a great position: Anaheim is 13-0 in the playoffs when scoring at least twice. Then Moen put them right where they want to be &#8212; ahead in the finals. As thrilled as the sellout crowd was in the arena, it was nowhere near the excitement back in Saskatchewan, where his family and friends camped out in front of the TV to see him play.

And they're doing it against one of their biggest rivals. Justin Morneau homered and drove in four runs and the Twins beat the Chicago White Sox 9-2 Tuesday night for their third straight win. Morneau went 3-for-4 and Jason Kubel added a two-run homer to complement another strong start from Boof Bonser. Michael Cuddyer and Luis Castillo each had three hits. "We're starting to turn it around," Torii Hunter said. "All cylinders are clicking. Man, that'd be big if we can sweep tomorrow. You're talking about the Chicago White Sox." Chicago's struggling pitching staff has allowed 47 hits over the last three games. White Sox pitchers allowed a season-worst 16 hits for the second consecutive game, and walked seven. "Pitching will dictate the game and the last two games the starters and relievers have done a real poor job," Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen said. "Since we've been here, we've played real poorly. They've done the opposite. They've outplayed us right now." Minnesota (26-25) has won six of seven to move over .500 for the first time since May 9. It has won four straight series. Morneau's towering home run in the third clanked off the scoreboard in right field and gave Minnesota a 3-1 lead. Kubel hit a two-run drive to right-center later in the inning. Morneau barely missed another homer in the fourth when his long fly ball hit high off the wall in right. He added a two-run double in the fifth, prompting the Metrodome crowd to begin a chant of "MVP! MVP!" "It's almost like he's expected to hit a home run every time now," Cuddyer said of the reigning AL MVP. Perhaps just as promising as the Twins' rediscovered offense is the emergence of Bonser as a legitimate No. 2 starter behind ace Johan Santana. Bonser (4-1) didn't win his first game until his eighth start this season, but has since rattled off four in a row. The 6-foot-4, 260-pounder entered the game third in the AL in strikeouts per nine innings and fanned six in 6 2-3 innings against Chicago, lowering his ERA to 3.61. He left to a standing ovation in the sixth after loading the bases and walking in a run. "The record part of it is overrated," said Twins catcher Mike Redmond, who left in the eighth inning after being hit by a pitch in the left elbow. He should be OK. "To me, he's been pretty consistent all year. It's nice to score some runs for him. He deserves it." John Danks (3-5) lasted just 3 1-3 innings for the White Sox, allowing six runs and nine hits. Danks was 3-0 with a 1.89 ERA in his three previous starts. He earned his first major league win over the Twins on May 9, giving up one run and three hits in 6 2-3 innings. "I don't know what happened. That's the only way to describe it," Danks said. "I just stunk. Whenever I would get ahead in the count, I wasn't able to throw the pitch I wanted to." Castillo has hit safely in 18 of his last 20 games and tallied his 1,500th career hit with a single in the sixth inning. Twins manager Ron Gardenhire announced after the game that the team will call up prospect Kevin Slowey to start Friday's game against Oakland. Slowey is 6-2 with a 1.54 ERA for Triple-A Rochester. An official roster move will be made after Wednesday's game. Slowey replaces Ramon Ortiz, who was demoted to the bullpen after his last start and pitched a perfect ninth inning in his first relief appearance Tuesday. Notes:@ Chicago's Darin Erstad extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a single to lead off the game. ... Tuesday marked the one-year anniversary of Castillo's last error. Castillo's major league record of errorless games at second base now stands at 138. ... The Twins were retired in order for the first time the entire series in the seventh inning. ... Chicago slugger Jermaine Dye had his 14-game hitting streak snapped. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. &#8212; The buzz among the dozens of NBA executives and coaches sitting in the stands at the Milk House gym on the Disney Wide World of Sports complex had nothing to do with the 62 prospects gathered at the league's predraft camp. It had everything to do with the trade demands from Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant &#8212; trade demands that appeared to be short-lived but rose from the dead later in the day. When Charlotte part-owner Michael Jordan entered the building for the predraft camp's afternoon session, he spotted Memphis general manager Jerry West sitting in the stands. "How you doing, kiddo?" Jordan yelled from the balcony. "So, you're in the middle of all of this turmoil?" West shrugged his shoulders and replied: "Help." Lakers GM Mitch Kupchak, who sat a few feet away, is the third member of a sordid Los Angeles triangle that was created by Bryant. In the morning, the Lakers star told ESPN radio "I would like to be traded, yeah. Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative." A few hours later, he backtracked from those statements in subsequent radio interviews and implied that he wants West, whose contract with the Grizzlies expires June 30, to return to Los Angeles where he played and built Lakers teams that won three championships in the 1990s. Still later, Bryant spoke to the Los Angeles Times and reversed positions again, repeating his desire for a trade. A daily rundown on the three players with Northwest connections at the predraft camp Oregon G Aaron Brooks: The former Franklin High star went a long ways to proving he's more than a scorer, recording five assists and six rebounds in leading his team to a 78-67 victory. "There's no way he's a first-round guy. I don't see that. Second round? Maybe. If you're looking for an energy guy to come off your bench, then he makes sense. But he's 6-foot and he's a 2-guard." Nevada G Marcelus Kemp: The Garfield High grad did little to improve his chances, failing to convince scouts he's more than a scorer. Scored 11 points on 5-for-10 shooting, including a long three-pointer. "Another year [in school] wouldn't hurt. He can still go back because he didn't sign with an agent." Boise State G Coby Karl: For long stretches, he was the best player on the court despite a strong performance from Pittsburgh center Aaron Gray. Though likely an off guard in the NBA, Karl played point guard because no one else on his team could handle the position. He led his squad to a blowout victory and finished with 11 points. "He showed some of the little things that make him a potential NBA player. He ran the team well. He liked passing the ball. He has an understanding of things and a good basketball IQ, but he has to show other scouts other things." "Nothing's changed," Bryant told the paper. "It's just a matter of I don't want to go no place else. I don't have much of a choice. When things like this go down, you just sit back. What can I do? It's like a broken record." The Los Angeles Times reporter then asked Bryant if he still wanted to be traded, to which Bryant quickly and firmly replied: "yes." After hearing his early morning trade demand, many executives at the camp contemplated trading for Bryant. "I guess there's no harm in dreaming," Boston general manager Danny Ainge said before laughing. "I don't think you'd be doing your job, if you didn't give it some thought. We'll see what happens there and that's about all I can say." Like a dozen other NBA teams, the Sonics were briefly in the middle of Bryant trade rumors, primarily because they own the second pick in next month's NBA draft. One report had Seattle signing free agent Rashard Lewis, then trading him or Ray Allen to the Lakers along with the No. 2 pick for Bryant. On Tuesday, president Lenny Wilkens said he'd listen to offers for the second pick, but admitted that he'd only part with the pick in a "blockbuster deal." Greg Oden or Kevin Durant? New York coach Isiah Thomas said the choice isn't as clear-cut as many might believe and considers himself a big fan of the Texas freshman forward. "He's unlike anybody that I've ever seen," Thomas said. "I've never seen a guy quite like him. I've never seen a 6-11 guy do this. I've seen [Kevin] Garnett. I've seen [Dirk] Nowitzki and I've seen all the 6-10, 6-11 supposedly mobile kind of guys. But he [Durant] takes it to another level." Thomas lavished praise on Durant, but NBA rules prohibited him from responding to reports of New York's interest in Lewis. When asked if the Knicks will have an active offseason acquiring free agents and making trades, he said: "I'm listening. If there's a way we can upgrade our team, we definitely will. We're not in a hurry to do anything. The waters are still in Knicks camp. Slow and steady wins the race. We're not looking to make any mistakes. We'll be cautious and very conservative." &#8226; If the Sonics do not renew assistant ' contract today as expected, then he may land in Charlotte on Lewis, who played three seasons in the NBA, spent 1-&#189; seasons in Charlotte. Sonics assistant has drawn interest from Milwaukee. Contrary to an earlier report, New York assistant said the Sonics have not contacted him. &#8226; Despite an invitation, Arizona G , who prepped at Roosevelt High, is a curious no-show at the camp. Calls to Williams' agent said he is unaware why Williams did not attend. Oregon guard , who worked out with Williams in Las Vegas this month, said he thought Williams would arrive on Saturday for physicals and testing. &#8226; Three weeks ago, Durant signed with the Upper Deck trading-card company. Terms were not released, but an industry source said Durant received a $5.5 million deal. , Durant and other top prospects will take part in a media interview session today.

This one tough for him to stomach Matsuzaka not pleased after loss By Christopher L. Gasper, Globe Staff | This time it wasn't his stomach that left Daisuke Matsuzaka feeling queasy. It was the Cleveland Indians' offense. During his last start in Texas, the Japanese sensation was seen dry-heaving in the dugout runway. No need for the Pepto-Bismol this time, just better command. Trying to join teammate Josh Beckett as an eight-game winner, Matsuzaka (7-3) instead suffered his first loss since April 17 as the Indians battered him for six runs (all earned) and 12 hits in 5 2/3 innings to avoid a series sweep and snap the Red Sox' five-game winning streak with an 8-4 victory last night at Fenway Park. The hits tied Curt Schilling for the most allowed by a Sox starter this season, and the loss snapped Matsuzaka's six-game winning streak, the longest by a Red Sox rookie since Aaron Sele reeled off six straight in 1993. Matsuzaka, who saw his ERA climb to 4.83, dismissed the notion that his nausea in the Lone Star State contributed to his outing last night. "I don't think it had any specific effect," said Matsuzaka through translator Masa Hoshino. "I was able to prepare for this start as I usually do." Matsuzaka danced in and out of trouble before the Indians tagged him for four runs in the sixth to turn a 2-2 deadlock into a 6-2 lead and force him out of the game. Cleveland sent eight men to the plate in the inning, and the big blow was a two-run homer into the visitors' bullpen by center fielder Grady Sizemore, who entered last night 0 for 7 in the series. "Against a lineup like that, if you don't consistently make pitches, they have that chance to hurt you," said manager Terry Francona. "Even some of the fastballs he got outs on tonight he misfired on the other side of the plate and [still] got outs. But he wasn't locating it like he can, like he has, like he will." Matsuzaka, who struck out four and walked none, continued a disturbing trend by being bitten by a big inning. He has seen 18 of his 39 earned runs come in just four innings this season and has allowed four or more runs in an inning four times. Last Friday, it was five runs in the fourth against the Rangers. However, catcher Jason Varitek said that all of Matsuzaka's problems can't be blamed on a seeming inability to stop the bleeding at times. "It's been different things," said Varitek. "He's gotten burned on different pitches. I don't think it's that as much as just getting over the hump and getting through innings. We've gotten through innings like that, too, very much so. The two-run homer was more big than the other two runs." Matsuzaka had only one 1-2-3 inning, the third. He loaded the bases in the first before getting Trot Nixon to ground into a double play and stranded Josh Barfield, who singled and stole second, in the second. Cleveland broke through in the fifth against the $103.1 million man to erase a 2-0 Boston lead. Former Sox prospect Kelly Shoppach, who had a career-high four hits, started things with a single. He came around on a Casey Blake ground out. Cleveland got another run when Travis Hafner plated Sizemore, who had doubled to left, with another double to left. Things got dicier for Daisuke in the sixth when five of the six batters he faced belted hits. Cleveland finished with a season-high 18 hits. Matsuzaka acknowledged that he is still trying to find the consistency he had with the Seibu Lions in Japan. "I'm trying to improve my game overall, and it is a challenge," he said. "I'm always keeping in mind that I want to avoid being a burden to my teammates. I hope I can achieve that level of consistency sooner rather than later." So do the Red Sox. But for now, it's important to remember that no matter his price tag or Green Monster-sized hype, Matsuzaka is not like Pedro Mart&#xED;nez, who came to Boston with a Cy Young Award already on his r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;. He is a rookie pitcher feeling his way in the big leagues. His teammates haven't lost sight of that, even if others have. "It's tough to look at him as a rookie because of who he is and everything, even though he is," said Varitek. "He's gone through adjustments -- new teams, new faces, new lineups, new everything. It's all new, and sometimes you forget that because of all the hype he came in with." Christopher L. Gasper can be reached at &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingsports/ci_6025585&cid San Jose Mercury News - Guerrero's 3-run homer lifts Angels 8-6 san jose / valley start / stop paper (From the last 24 hours) ACLU targets planner of so-called CIA torture flights Prosecutors: Aptos woman lived high life on &#36;1.5 million stolen... Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Guerrero's 3-run homer lifts Angels 8-6 Article Launched: 05/30/2007 11:29:29 PM PDT ANAHEIM, Calif.- It isn't often the Los Angeles Angels get home runs from their 3-4-5 hitters in the same game. They came at the right time, because Jered Weaver didn't have his best stuff. Vladimir Guerrero hit a go-ahead, three-run shot off Felix Hernandez, Gary Matthews Jr. and Casey Kotchman hit consecutive home runs in the first, and the Angels bullpen preserved an 8-6 win over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night. "It's good, because there are going to be sometimes when we're not going to do well offensively and our pitchers pick us up and keep us in close ballgames," Guerrero said through a translator. "We have a good pitching staff, and hopefully all of us can contribute to them." Guerrero's homer was his first since May 17 at Seattle. It hasn't been easy getting good pitches to hit, because everyone is pitching around the 2004 AL MVP. Guerrero's greatest strength is he is one of the game's best bad-ball hitters. "I can't get frustrated because it's part of the game. I've been saying that for a long time," Guerrero said. "I don't get frustrated because I trust the people that hit behind me. The home runs just happen when they happen. I don't worry about when they come or when they don't come. But I'm very happy that this one came tonight." Dustin Moseley (4-0) got the win in relief of Weaver, who was pulled after 4 2-3 innings with the Angels down 5-4. After Guerrero's homer put Los Angeles ahead 7-5, Moseley pitched two innings and gave up an RBI double to Raul Ibanez that cut the Angels' edge to 7-6 in the sixth. But Scot Shields pitched a perfect eighth and Francisco Rodriguez worked the ninth for his 18th save in 19 chances. Hernandez (3-3) allowed seven runs and nine hits in seven innings. He surrendered his first three homers of the season, as the Angels took the rubber game of the series and extended their lead in the AL West to 5 1/2 games over the second-place Mariners. "We were a little disappointed because we felt we had a chance to win the game with our ace on the mound," Adrian Beltre said. "It didn't happen, but we're going to get a chance to face these guys again, and hopefully we can do better next time. We've got four months left, so one series is not going to make a difference right now." Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak to 23 games&mdash;tying his career best in 2001. The two-time AL batting champion is within one game of the franchise record set by Joey Cora in 1997. Weaver had won his previous three starts, and the Angels gave him a 4-1 lead in the first inning. But the Mariners made it 4-all on Beltre's RBI double in the fifth and Yuniesky Betancourt followed with an RBI single that finished the right-hander. "My command just really wasn't there," Weaver said. "The off-speed stuff felt great, but I was struggling with my fastball command. I just couldn't make my pitches and they put some good swings on the ball." Pinch-hitter Robb Quinlan drove in an insurance run in the Angels seventh with a sacrifice fly that Betancourt caught. The shortstop made an over-the-shoulder catch in short left-center field and couldn't get the ball home fast enough after Reggie Willits tagged up. Guerrero had a chance to break open the game in the eighth, but struck out with the bases loaded against Brandon Morrow. The rookie reliever extended his scoreless streak to 15 2-3 consecutive innings. The Mariners wrapped up a 6-4 road trip that began with a makeup game in Cleveland and continued through Tampa Bay, Kansas City and Anaheim. When they return to Seattle, the journey will have covered 6,273 miles. "It's going to be good to get back home," Beltre said. "We finished the road trip over .500 and we could have done better, but it was a good trip." Notes:@ Angels infielder Erick Aybar started at third base for the first time in his professional career. Normally a second baseman, he made a neat play on the first batter of the game, making a diving stop on Suzuki's grounder in the hole and throwing him out from one knee. ... Angels RHP Bartolo Colon's next scheduled start on Sunday was pushed back to June 8, when the club opens a nine-game road trip at St. Louis. The 2005 AL Cy Young winner, experiencing tightness in his triceps since early this month, has allowed 15 runs in 10 2-3 innings over his last two starts.

Peavy, who has skyrocketed to the top of nearly everyone's Cy Young watch list, might well be the toast of the National League these days, but Young certainly isn't far behind, in case anyone has noticed this much. You can bet the Pirates did Wednesday night, though they certainly weren't the first to get a taste of Young's dominant stuff -- especially during his blissful run in May that ended as well as it started. Young limited the Pirates to four hits over seven scoreless innings as the Padres defeated Pittsburgh, 9-0, before a crowd of 12,734 which probably wouldn't have been happy to hear that the 6-foot-10 right-hander was once property of the Pirates. "I thought Chris threw the ball very well again," Padres manager Bud Black said. "I think he's on a nice roll. His mechanics, his confidence, his stuff is all coming together. I think we are seeing the results of that in his performance. He's throwing the ball great." It was difficult to tell if Black was talking about the victory by the Padres (30-22) on this night in particular, or Young's fantastic run in May that saw him go 4-1 with a no-decision and a scant 1.13 ERA. His overall ERA has dropped from 4.33 on April 26 to 2.42. "This is the third time since the beginning of last season that we have seen him and we've not been able to do much at all with him," Pittsburgh manager Jim Tracy said. "There is deception with him obviously, and there is something with him that we're not seeing. "I think the size of the man, his deception, his slider seems to be very difficult for our right-handed hitters. We've had very little success with this guy." Indeed, Tracy is right. Young is 3-0 with a 0.76 ERA in his last three starts against the Pirates, including the start last season that saw him finish two outs shy of a no-hitter against the team that drafted him in 2000 only to ship him off to Montreal two years later for, gulp, Matt Herges. Not that any of this interests Young, his dominance over the Pirates or the fact he fared as well as he did in May. April, May ... September, it doesn't really matter much to Young when he pitches well as it does how often he pitches well. After a hiccup in April -- Young was 2-2 with a 4.33 ERA after his first five starts -- he's shifted into Chris Young circa 2006 mode, when he didn't lose a road start all season and ranked among the league leaders in several pitching categories. Young looked every bit like that 2006 model, making quick work of the Pirates (23-29), facing 16 batters over the first five innings. He didn't allow a runner to reach base until the sixth inning when, with one out and runners at second and third, he got Chris Duffy to pop out to shortstop Khalil Greene in foul territory and then got the defending National League batting champion, Freddy Sanchez, to ground out to end the inning. No sweat, or, at least, it didn't look like much of one. "I felt good for the most part and I was able to execute my pitches pretty well," he said. "I had command of my fastball ... that's my bread and butter." That and his slider, a pitch that has shown plenty of bite to it in May. It's a pitch that he used to finish off hitters in his last start on May 24 against the Cubs when he struck out 10 batters. Young had seven strikeouts on Wednesday, many coming on the slider when hitters were geared toward sitting on his fastball. "When you're having guys swing and miss or swing at as many fastballs as he does, it makes all his other stuff that much more effective," Pirates left fielder Jason Bay said. "He has a very deceptive fastball ... and it worked well for him." So did Young's bat, which provided a big-at-the-moment RBI single up the middle, after a botched suicide squeeze attempt in the fifth inning, that gave the Padres a 2-0 advantage. That was the score entering the eighth inning when the Padres scored five runs -- four on Greene's grand slam over the wall in center field. Greene's hit with the bases loaded snapped a 5-for-42 San Diego slump with the bases loaded in 2007. And while that hit alone merely raised the club's average this season with the bases full from .125 to .139, it certainly felt much bigger. "Sometimes, I think we try to get it all at once," said Padres center fielder Mike Cameron, who had three hits and knocked in three runs. "Tonight was collectively pretty good." Especially for Greene, who came into the game hitting .214. While Young has flourished in May, Greene has been mired in what seems like a month-long funk. He was hitting just .153 in May before Wednesday. And while one swing certainly gave the Padres something they haven't had much of this season -- an abundance of runs -- Greene was pragmatic about the offense. "I don't think we're an overly dynamic team as far as scoring runs," he said. "I think we are going to score runs throughout the season, but I don't think it will be five, six or seven runs a game." They might not have to, not with Peavy (7-1) -- who conducted an interview with Sports Illustrated and taped a segment for ESPN's "Rome is Burning" on Wednesday -- and Young, who might just be the best 1-2 punch in the National League, let alone baseball. is a reporter for MLB.com.

Owner Craig Leipold bought the Predators for $80 million and could sell the team for $220 million. That's a $140 million profit. A silo full of milk and cheese. Leipold said he lost $70 million during his tenure, so that's a $70 million profit for buying a hockey team in Tennessee and living in Wisconsin. SHOT OF THE WEEK Every week, we present an NHL photo and I provide a caption. E-mail me your suggestions (include your name and hometown/state) and the next week we will use the best ones and provide a new photo. "Dude, where's my Zamboni?" (Getty Image) "Ar, there be whales here." -- J.D. Frankland (El Segundo, Calif.) "Vodka!?! I am gonna get Alfie for this!" "Darn this New Jersey tap water!" -- Nick Krieger (Washington Twp., N.J.) Ray's latest ploy to keep the crease clear -- Dentyne Ice. -- Chris Neufeld (Kadena Air Base -- Okinawa, Japan) "God bless you. I hope an anvil falls on your head tomorrow." (AP Photo) being laughed out of a bar in 1972 if you said, "Someday, a guy who lives in Wisconsin will get an expansion team in Nashville, sell it a few years later and make $70 million." I bet you would have gotten a can of Blatz or Schlitz shoved up your left nostril out of sheer stupidity. So, as Leipold prepares to leave with his $70 million bag of money, Predators season-ticket holders are out tens of thousands of dollars in tickets, parking, bad beer and hideous uniforms. It's the same old story. And look who is back in town. Our boy, Jim Balsillie! After agreeing in principal to buy the Predators from Leipold this past week, it is seems likely that he will work hard to get his team and move it to Kansas City, Las Vegas, Winnipeg or Ontario. He can help his boy Phil Anschutz get his team in Kansas City, get a state-of-the-art arena built for him in Vegas with the potential for revenue stream or bring a team to Canada and receive hero worship. One of those things will likely happen, whether it's after next season or in the future. Bet on the Preds leaving after the 2007-08 campaign. That was the plan in Pittsburgh, and now that's the plan in Nashville. attendance in Nashville does not average at least 14,000 next season, and the city can buy all of those tickets, the Preds can pay an exit fee of $18 million to get out of their arena lease and leave Music City USA. Balsillie has $18 million in his glove compartment. Also, the Preds had fewer than 9,000 season-ticket subscribers despite the success of the team, which amassed 110 points this season (tied with Anaheim for third best in the NHL). Next season, the Predators will not be the third-best team in the NHL. I would suspect nearly all of their key unrestricted free agents will walk. will sell their homes now and look to move elsewhere. Forsberg will just check out of the local Hampton Inn. There is too much uncertainty with the team. Will they be in Nashville one more season? Two? Three? Will they find a way to leave in July?! Who knows? We do know that losing those four players will change the Predators' place in the standings. The Predators can then bring up the financial losses and shed more payroll by trading existing contracts for draft picks. ( The Preds do not have a first-round pick this June.) The message will then be clear that the Predators want to move. Neither the fans nor the city will continue to shell out hard-earned money in an attempt to play a game of financial chicken with a billionaire. "Let's all buy Predators tickets, watch them lose to Columbus 5-1 and keep the Preds in Nashville!" Bucci believes that time is running out for Predators fans in Nashville. It will be a lost year. Listen, I don't care what Balsillie does with the team. Nashville has shown it probably isn't an NHL city. Fewer than 9,000 season tickets for a 110-point team might be good for arena football or indoor lacrosse or the WNBA, but the NHL isn't like any of those leagues. There are other markets that will produce much larger season-ticket numbers. I've been writing for years that I'm all for another team moving to Canada. That's where the NFL-like passion is, and certainly Ontario can support another NHL team. Kansas City is the favorite because it has a rent-free arena ready to go and Balsillie can hook up his boys in the Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG). If the arena in Winnipeg is NHL caliber in terms of amenities and revenue, it has a shot. Otherwise, Balsillie has to get going and get an arena deal soon for it to be built in time for the 2008-09 season. Perhaps, he already has the framework in place. One way or another, things will likely take shape soon. Whatever the case, turn out the lights Nashville, the party's over. Well, after eight months, here we are. The final series. A best-of-seven for the Stanley Cup. Both teams won 48 games during the regular season and both have won 12 playoff games. One team, one coach, one city will be changed (for the near NHL future, anyway). One team will be able to say, for the rest of their lives, I am a Stanley Cup champion. That is huge. Unbelievably huge. The ASH line of has separated themselves from every other line in hockey. If Ottawa wins this finals series in five games, then it will be an ASH Wednesday. It's hard, however, to believe Anaheim could possibly lose four of five games to anyone. I'm picking Ottawa in this series because of the big line, and the fact that Anaheim continues to lean on 22-year-old , which is always dangerous. That's a lot of responsibility for a young player. Gary A. Vasquez/US Presswire Jean-Sebastien Giguere will have to continue to be a rock in net if the Ducks are to have any chance in the Cup finals. Anaheim has the better goalie and two Hall of Fame defensemen. They have a Hall of Famer in , who should find some holes in if he can get quality chances. And that's the question. Ottawa has lots of speed, lots of jam and plays terrific defense. Anaheim does not have a prolific offense. That sets up well for the Senators. But Ottawa has yet to face a scary, physical team this postseason. Pittsburgh, New Jersey and Buffalo are not scary teams. Anaheim is scary. Spezza, Heatley and Alfredsson won't have it easy against the Ducks. They will get physically pounded in this series. will enjoy playing the Ducks because he becomes an important figure in terms of responding to their physical play. I also get a sense is going to do something big in this series. It seems tailor-made for him, too. These are two great teams. I'd love to see a seven-game series and the thick drama it would provide as players on both teams look for their first Stanley Cup. Anaheim can win this series if is out of his mind, but I think Ottawa will win because: &#8226; The Senators are a very good defensive team that can score. &#8226; Their defense is very rugged. More rugged than Minnesota, Vancouver and Detroit. &#8226; Ottawa has had easy travel. You could hitchhike to Pittsburgh, New Jersey and Buffalo. &#8226; Alfredsson, Heatley and Spezza are top-shelf players, possibly Hall of Famers. They have good size, good reach and are flying right now. They will score power-play goals. In the end, it's a coin flip. These are two great teams. The games will probably be low scoring and close. I think if Ottawa splits in Anaheim, it will come back home and win two there and control the series. Anaheim will be looking to punch Ottawa in the face, kill some early-series power plays and wear down a Senators team that hasn't had a street fight. How the games are called is a huge factor. If the game is called close, it favors Ottawa. If the refs let them play, it favors Anaheim. I'll say they call it close and Ottawa wins in six. The San Jose Sharks' recipe for offseason success? Re-sign to New York for Marc Staal and then trade back to Chicago for a bag of pucks. Now, use that cap space created to sign Drury or Briere. Finally, hand Ron Wilson his pink slip and hire Pat Burns. Problem solved. I see no reason to make a coaching change in San Jose. They need more personality on the back end and I would be very careful about trading a talent like Patrick Marleau. What will happen with Bertuzzi and the Red Wings? Do the Wings take a chance and sign him even with his bad back? Wings fans have been complaining that he didn't contribute enough. A lot of hockey fans, including Wings fans, are still very much against him for the incident. I have mixed feelings myself. I can't throw in my support for him until he proves his back has healed, and I think sometimes his poor play is the result of guilt over that cheap shot. Your thoughts? Osan AB, South Korea I would only sign for a very low salary and at one-year intervals. His health and demeanor are not worth any long-term investment. I'm a long-time reader, but this is my first time to write in. I've been moving around Texas the past few months, switching between going to school, doing an internship and visiting my parents at home. It's been getting more and more frustrating trying to watch the playoffs. First, a few of the Stars-Canucks games were only aired on Fox Sports Net, and got preempted by early-season Astros games down in Houston. Then, later playoff rounds were played on Versus. I find out that my cable provider has changed Versus to a secondary channel, and is thus not provided with the basic 100-channel package. When can we hope to see the NHL where it belongs, on ESPN again, if ever? I don't know how sports TV contracts work; could the NHL and ESPN at least agree on a deal to show the playoffs? The NHL doesn't deserve to be treated on the same level as the Professional Bull Riders Association. Fort Worth/College Station/Houston, Texas Versus is the exclusive cable provider for the NHL. ESPN has always been interested in the NHL, but at a price that makes sense to those making the decisions. The NHL can come back to ESPN any time they want. I don't know what heaven is going to be like, but I'll bet I'll feel something like I do right now. I'm so happy my Ducks are in the dance. I think we've got a great shot at winning. I look at Ottawa and don't see the offense outside of their big three, and they'll have to look at Pronger and Niedermayer and Beauchemin and O'Donnell every shift. I think they can be corralled, and with Giggy playing like he is, where is their scoring? On the other hand, Emery has been good, but he's no Backstrom, Luongo or Hasek. I think the Ducks win in five, right here in Disneyland. Good analysis, Rik. Both teams are playing the best opponent they have seen thus far. If someone doesn't step up, either team could win a quick series because both teams are so good. Sometimes in a matchup like this, where two good teams meet, one gets the upper hand early and just rolls. I have read in numerous places that the Penguins will be players in the free-agent market this offseason (including your May 22 mailbag). However, after many years of payroll slashing, I find it hard to believe the team would go after guys like Forsberg, Kariya or Timonen. Even the local Pittsburgh papers have them focusing on their own guys (Recchi, Roberts) and even trying to pry Alexei Morozov back from Europe. All of these deals would be short term and relatively cheap. While I agree that these guys would make the team much better going into next year -- what is it that has the non-Pittsburgh media excited about the Pens in free agency? Crosby and the lads were good all year, and I think Ray Shero is not going to tinker with the lineup as much as some suspect. What are your thoughts? The Penguins need more scoring and better defensive acumen up front and in front of . But the Penguins will get better every year because they are so young, and young teams normally get smarter, stronger and better. Add the right players as the young players simply improve, and the Penguins can make huge steps quickly. The Penguins need a winger for . They also need some defensemen who have the ability to choke a raccoon to death with their bare hands. If you are the Flyers, do you keep the second pick or trade it? If you keep it, who do you take? If you trade it, to whom and for what? Listen to your scouts and pick the best player. You can't beat the value of a young, fast, talented player who you only have to pay $850,000-900,000 a year. Unless a team blows you away, and that happens sometimes, keep collecting assets. After three rounds of having you pick against my Sens, I am disquieted to see that you took the Sens in the finals. If we go down, it's on you. As a Wings fan, it was heartbreaking to see the team get close to getting its prestige back this season with a deep playoff run that ended too soon. However, the team still has a lot of good, young talent and prospects in all positions, but the goalie position is one that is interesting. Hasek is 40-whatever, Osgood has shown to be a good backup these days and still is waiting for his chance. What do you think the Wings will do next season to secure the net? I think they might take a run at John Buccigross' e-mail address -- for questions, comments or crosschecks -- is john.buccigross@espn.com.

http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/n/a/2007/05/29/sports/s222211D70.DTL&cid Piniella Fumes After 'Worst' Cubs Loss Piniella Fumes After 'Worst' Cubs Loss Tuesday, May 29, 2007 (05-29) 22:22 PDT Chicago (AP) -- Lou Piniella didn't need too many words to sum up what he saw Tuesday night. Jeremy Hermida hit a tiebreaking three-run homer in the fifth inning and Josh Willingham added a three-run double in the eighth to lead the Florida Marlins to a 9-4 victory over the slumping Chicago Cubs. Derrek Lee hit a solo homer and pinch-hitter Ryan Theriot added a two-run drive in the seventh for the Cubs, who have lost seven of their last nine. "That might be our worst game of the year," said Piniella, who will address the team on Wednesday about its recent poor play. After Piniella addressed the bad baserunning by the Cubs in his pregame meeting with the media, Mark DeRosa got thrown out at third, trying to advance from second on a grounder to shortstop in the second inning and Michael Barrett got picked off at second in the same inning. "Not a good play," Piniella said on DeRosa's choice to go to third. "Getting picked off second base not a good play." Dontrelle Willis (7-3) worked seven innings for Florida, allowing four runs and seven hits. Willis, a former Cubs farmhand, struck out two and walked one. He also was a starter on the 2003 championship team that eliminated the Cubs in the playoffs. "It's turned into a rivalry since 03," Willis said. Chicago led 2-0 after three innings but the Marlins pushed across two in the fourth and three in the fifth. Miguel Olivo drove in Willingham with a sacrifice fly and Willis singled in Hermida in the fourth. Hermida hit a drive to right-center off Jason Marquis in the fifth for his third homer of the season. Chicago loaded the bases with one out in the ninth but Kevin Gregg struck out Cliff Floyd and Lee to earn his sixth save. "We still had a big lead," Gregg said. "Even though they had guys on base they still had to get a couple of more guys across to get in a bad situation. We just shut it down right there and ended the rally." Marquis (5-2) allowed five runs, four earned, and eight hits in five innings to get his first loss since April 10. He had won his last five decisions. "Starting with me, I need to play smarter. It's one thing to play harder, but there is no excuse to play dumber," Barrett said. Lee broke out of a 5-for-31 slump with a drive off Willis in the first inning. It was Lee's fourth homer of the season. He also doubled in Alfonso Soriano in the third inning to make it 2-0. "I thought he (Willis) just made two bad pitches," Marlins manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "Other than that, I think all the hits were ground-ball base hits going through the infield." Notes:@ The Marlins have beat the Cubs six straight times, dating to last season. ... All of Lee's homers this season have come at Wrigley Field. ... Willis allowed his first homer of his career at Wrigley Field in 33 2-3 innings. ... Willis was 2-for-3 with an RBI.

Hewitt, a former number one whose game is coming together again, is on the opposite career track of Argentine Gaudio, whose form has slid badly since his highlight Roland Garros title three years ago. The 28-year-old Argentine has had a misery season with reports of retirement also being considered. The 14th-seeded Hewitt may have hastened that process with his fight-back second-round victory in three hours, 28 minutes. On his back foot in the early stages against Gaudio, who came in with 21 Roland Garros wins, Hewitt dug in for the kind of tennis scrap that he appreciates. With Davis Cup captain John Fitzgerald looking on, the former US Open and Wimbledon winner got himself back into contention as he claimed the third set after two hours and 17 minutes of battle. It took another hour-plus for the Aussie to move through, piling on three love games in the deciding fifth set and advancing on the first of three match points to lift his record at the event to 21-7. Sixth seed Novak Djokovic had to overcome a bout of negativity before knocking out the lowest-ranked player remaining in the draw, reaching the third round 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 over Laurent Recourderc. "I'm not so happy with my two performances here," said Djokovic. "But the positive thing is that I've won two matches, two rounds. "It was not easy, I'm favourite even in the next match (against Olivier Patience of France). So I'll try to do my best and start playing better." The Serb was joined as a winner by former Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis, with the 16th seed defeating Dane Kristian Pless 7-5, 6-3, 6-4. "It was a tricky match today," said Baghdatis, based in the city where he learend his tennis. "The 11 a.m. start changed by rhythm of sleeping, waking up early in the morning. "In the first couple of games, I didn't feel good going on court. I was a bit stressed. Slowly, slowly I found the rhythm and the way to win. So that's the most important thing." Djokovic kept pace as he pulled level with Rafael Nadal on 37 season wins, the most on the ATP. Qualifier Recourderc, ranked 306, showed spirit but was ultimately overpowered by the young talent who cracked the Top five for the first time a month ago. Roland Garros was the venue of Djokovic's best Grand Slam showing when he reached the quarter-finals a year ago, retiring with a back injury after two sets against Nadal. He has also three titles so far this season - the same as Roger Federer and second behind Nadal on four. Djokovic fired five aces and broke six times as he advanced on a dry and partly cloudy day at Roland Garros after a week of rain interruptions. In women's play, the Serbian momentum was boosted by seventh seed Ana Ivanovic, who beat Sania Mirza of India 6-1, 6-4. Swiss 14th seed Patty Schnyder moved through to the third round over Kateryna Bondarenko of the Ukraine 6-3, 6-2. The Post Publishing Public Co., Ltd. 2006 Printed display ad enquiries to:

Salem-News.com is the Publisher of Frontline-News Pahlsson Goal Gives Ducks 2-0 Stanley Cup Lead The Senators never were able to mount much of an offensive challenge in Game 2, being out-shot 31-16 in the game. ANAHEIM, Calif. - Sammy Pahlsson, a finalist for the Selke Trophy as the NHLâ€™s top defensive forward, was the offensive hero for Anaheim Wednesday night, scoring the lone goal of Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Final as the Ducks blanked the Ottawa Senators, 1-0, to grab a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. Pahlsson took advantage of a neutral-zone turnover by Ottawaâ€™s Dany Heatley to gain the Senatorsâ€™ zone with some speed. Racing past Daniel Alfredsson, Pahlsson snapped a shot from the dot of the right circle through the legs of defenseman Joe Corvo and past the stick side of goalie Ray Emery for the goal at 14:16 of the third period. â€Well, the goal was a turnover,â€ Pahlsson said. â€œI skated down the wing and stepped once inside and shot it through the legs of the defenseman and somehow, it went in.â€ There was no somehow about it. The shot was a big-time effort that slipped inside the far post. â€That line from the beginning of the year have been able to give us quality minutes,â€ Ducks coach Randy Carlyle said of the Pahlsson, Rob Niedermayer, Travis Moen unit. â€œAnd as you know in the playoffs, everybody steps up the defensive aspect of the game at least 20 to 25 percent. And always, people separate themselves on the offensive side. Itâ€™s nice to see that these three players are getting rewarded for hard work. â€The one thing about those guys, the play the tough minutes and a lot of time the spotlight has not been directed toward them. Right now, theyâ€™re earning that.â€ Losing the game was a bitter pill for Emery, who was fabulous in defeat and was deserving of a better fate. After a 3-2 loss in Game 1, Emery said he would be better, and he was. The Senators, who put some pressure on the Anaheim goal late, never were able to mount much of an offensive challenge in Game 2, being out-shot 31-16 in the game. â€It was a great shot,â€ Senators coach Bryan Murray said of Pahlssonâ€™s game-winner. â€œHe got Corvo turned around. He tried to do something with the stick, got spun, and he used Corvo as a screen and hit inside the post. Great shot. Great play on his part.â€ Now, the Senators have to battle history as well as the Ducks. Of the 30 home teams who have won the first two games of the Stanley Cup Final since the series became a best-of-seven affair in 1939, 29 have gone on to capture the Cup. The Sens will now call upon the ghosts of the 1971 Montreal Canadiens, who came back from the 0-2 deficit to win in seven games. Goalie J.S. Giguere was his indomitable self for the Ducks, getting to every shot that came his way. He has allowed just two goals in two games of the Final, while Emery has surrendered four goals in two games. Giguere was at his best during a multiple-save flurry during a 5-on-3 advantage for Ottawa. â€I just wanted to make sure that I would approach it with a lot of energy,â€ Giguere said. â€œI thought I was able to do the first save and guys were on the rebound right away. So, we got pretty fortunate that we were able to get out of that one with no goals.â€ Pahlsson is making quite a name for himself in this Final series. Known as a defensive whiz, his line, along with Niedermayer and Game 1 hero Moen, has made the Sensâ€™ top line of Alfredsson, Heatley and Jason Spezza disappear. â€Well, you know, we obviously want to focus on that top line and our checking line has done a great job of being physical against them,â€ Anaheim defenseman Chris Pronger said. â€œMaking them work inside on the puck and making them play defense. It's the best way to counteract offensive players.â€ â€Weâ€™re definitely counting on a couple of guys to be big-time players for us,â€ Murray said of his top scorers. â€œAnd they played much better tonight. But they didnâ€™t create much in the way of offense. Iâ€™m hoping when we get home, we can do a little juggling and it will come. â€But yeah, Iâ€™m concerned,â€ Murray continued. â€œThey have to help us win games on the road, as well as at home.â€ â€We've been scoring to this point and we're expected to score goals,â€ Spezza said. â€œIt's not a lack of effort. We're trying. We're getting pucks. We did a little better job of getting pucks on net and deep today. We didn't score those early goals. We know we have to be better, though.â€ The Senators now hope home cooking pays some dividends, returning to Ottawa for Game 3 Saturday night (8 p.m. ET, NBC, CBC, RDS, NHL Radio) and then again on Monday night as they try to get back into the series. â€Well, it's disappointing to not get a win down here,â€ Senators defenseman Chris Phillips said. â€œBut we can't hang our heads. There's a lot of pride in this room and we're going home now. We've got two games at home to even out the series.â€ â€We've kind of done our job,â€ Pronger said. â€œWe've won our two home games, and let's face it, you're supposed to win your home games. Now it's in their court. We're going to expect, obviously, a tougher environment in their building, and certainly their crowd will be behind them and cheering them on. So it will be a difficult atmosphere for sure.â€ Emery kept the Senators in the game in the second period as Ottawa was out-shot 14-4 in that period and 26-11 over the first 40 minutes. The second period began like it was in a lull after the physical and fast first 20 minutes, but as the clock ticked off the seconds, the Ducks got their second wind and began to press the advantage around Emery. Rob Niedermayer saw a backhand shot stopped by Emery and Todd Marchant grabbed the rebound and dominated the remainder of the shift. Emery snapped out a right pad at 11:40 to deny a testing drive by Corey Perry. Emery then made another key stop on Rob Niedermayer at the 10:00 mark. The Emery show continued with 6:54 left in the second as the Senators goalie made a huge save on Perry and the ensuing stuffer from Rob Niedermayer. With defenseman Tom Preissing off for tripping at 18:04, the Ducks had the man advantage and Emery made a nice save and clear on a point shot from Chris Pronger. The hits just kept coming in the scoreless first period almost as if Game 1 never ended. So, too, did the parade to the penalty box that made both coaches unhappy in Game 1. Shots in the first were 12-7 for the Ducks as both goalies made several key saves, especially on power plays, to keep the period scoreless. Ottawaâ€™s Mike Comrie was boxed for boarding at 2:17 and the Senators were able to kill off the penalty without too much difficulty. Anaheimâ€™s Drew Miller was called for interference at 5:40, another man-advantage that didnâ€™t prove especially troublesome. Anton Volchenkov threw a thundering hit on Corey Perry at 8:05, but was called for boarding, opening the door for some testing shots by the Ducks. First, Ryan Getzlaf was denied off a slick feed from Teemu Selanne. Moments later, Getzlaf was stropped again by Emery who clamped his glove on the rebound. Emery then got his right shoulder on a point drive shot from Pronger and then threw out his right pad to deny Selanne late in the power play. The Ducks dodged a huge bullet when Shawn Thornton was called for charging at 12:31 and was followed to the box by Pronger for slashing at 13:24, giving the Senators a 5-on-3 edge for 1:08. In that span, the Senators threw everything at Giguere, who responded with some tremendous save, including multiple stops on Alfredsson and Mike Comrie. The crowd roared as Pronger returned to the ice to kill off the remainder of the penalty time. â€We have to stop taking penalties like that, especially going down five-on-three,â€ Giguere said. â€œWe canâ€™t afford to do that every game. Itâ€™s going to end up costing us some goals eventually.â€ Anaheim finished off the remainder of the first on the power play after Mike Fisher was called for roughing Corey Perry at 18:06, a power play that carried over to the second period.

Iavaroni will be named the Grizzlies head coach today. Associated Press file photo Iavaroni played with such legends as Julius Erving when he was with the Philadelphia 76ers. Iavaroni's work ethic and enthusiasm are unquestioned. By Marlon W. Morgan ORLANDO -- Because Marc Iavaroni has worked under such coaches as Pat Riley, Mike Fratello and most recently as the lead assistant coach to Mike D'Antoni with the Phoenix Suns, D'Antoni isn't quite sure what to expect when Iavaroni calls his own plays for the first time during the 2007-08 season. Iavaroni is expected to be announced as the Grizzlies new coach at a 2 p.m. news conference today. ''He's been in all kinds of different systems,'' D'Antoni said. ''He'll have to have his own players, but he'll have his own stamp on it. It'll be interesting to see.'' One thing D'Antoni is certain about, Iavaroni, 50, is more than ready for his first head coaching gig. Iavaroni, who has had other interviews in recent years, was one of the hottest assistant coaches on the market this season, with his name mentioned with several other coaching vacancies. ''I'm really, really elated for him,'' D'Antoni said. ''I think it's great. He's ready. He'll be a great coach. It's a good situation and I hope he does well. He's ready to go. He's been ready to go for a couple of years. The opportunity finally presented itself. Rightly so, he jumped all over it.'' Iavaroni is the candidate Grizzlies president of basketball operations Jerry West had targeted since Fratello was fired in late December. Although West would not confirm Iavaroni's hiring, he did say the Suns assistant would be a great addition to the Grizzlies. ''I just think he's a great, great candidate,'' West said. ''As a matter of fact, I thought he was the best one out there. That's my personal opinion and it's only my opinion. I've always been a fan. I think he's someone, if we're fortunate enough to get him, it'll be a good thing for us.'' Former NBA player and Denver Nuggets general manager Kiki Vandeweghe used to work with Iavaroni at Hall of Fame coach Pete Newell's big man's camp. They also played against each other during Iavaroni's seven years in the NBA. He, too, believes Iavaroni will be a good fit in Memphis. ''He's a great competitor,'' Vandeweghe said. ''I would think he would do a great job. Marc is a very smart basketball guy and has a lot of enthusiasm. He'll work very hard.'' D'Antoni said Iavaroni's strengths include his work ethic, attention to detail and his teaching abilities. He went on to say that Iavaroni's abilities, combined with the Grizzlies' young talent, which includes Pau Gasol, Rudy Gay, Hakim Warrick, Kyle Lowry, Alexander Johnson, Tarence Kinsey, and the fourth pick, in next month's draft, should be a nice mix. D'Antoni quickly pointed out the Suns were one of the youngest teams in the league three years ago. Iavaroni was instrumental in helping develop that talent, among them being All-Star Amare Stoudemire, into one of the top teams in the NBA. ''You have to have talent in this league to be successful, and they have the makings of a good team. Marc will help that alone. There'll always be some growing pains, but he'll do a terrific job. ... It takes time like anything else, but he'll do great with it.'' Iavaroni's hiring leaves the Grizzlies with one other vacancy to fill, replacing current president of basketball operations Jerry West, whose last day is June 30. Vandeweghe has interviewed with Grizzlies majority owner Michael Heisley. He said he has not had any further conversations, but remains interested in the job. ''As far as I know, they're still going through some diligence,'' Vandeweghe said. Another person believed to be a candidate is Suns vice president of basketball operation David Griffin, who works under D'Antoni, also Phoenix's executive vice president of basketball operations and general manager. ''He would be another good candidate,'' D'Antoni said of Griffin. ''He's another guy that's very smart basketball-wise. He's been great.'' When asked why the Grizzlies opted to hire a coach before a general manager, West replied, ''We've got a president of basketball operations. Things will be taken care of. There's a lot of things you guys don't know that go on, and you don't need to know until they're announced.'' -- Marlon W. Morgan Browse or search for print ads Find local sales and online deals!

Lowe pitched seven scoreless innings, reached base three times and scored a run to help Los Angeles shut out the Washington Nationals for the second straight game, 5-0 on Wednesday night. Lowe (5-5) gave up three hits, struck out five and walked two while allowing only one batter past first base. He combined with relievers Jim Beimel and Rudy Seanez on a four-hitter. "The final line score looked good, but it was a struggle," Lowe said. "The outs weren't coming easy. Early in the game, the stuff wasn't there, so you kind of have to grind it out." Lowe said it took some time to find his stuff, but that he felt more comfortable after the first few innings. He retired nine if a row at one point from the third through the sixth innings. "As the game went on, it seemed like I got a little bit better," Lowe said. "Today was just a day where I was fortunate to make one good pitch per at-bat." Washington manager Manny Acta didn't seem to think Lowe had very much trouble. "He's pretty tough," Acta said. "He's got to be off his game for you to do any damage and he wasn't." Lowe also helped at the plate. He entered the game with a .105 batting average but singled once, walked twice and scored a run, reaching base in all three plate appearances. The Dodgers haven't given Lowe much support at times this season, scoring three runs or less in five of his first 11 starts. But two of Lowe's at-bats led to runs. "I tell you what, Derek was good at the plate, too," Los Angeles manager Grady Little said. "He had a couple of big walks, a base hit that contributed to some of the run scoring. It was good to see him come away from there with a win. Maybe that will get him off onto a roll." Los Angeles opened the three-game series Tuesday with a 10-0 victory and got help from starting pitcher Brad Penny at the plate in that contest. He went 2-for-2, and the Dodger starters are 3-for-3 with two walks and a sacrifice in the first two games. Lowe took care of the first seven innings, and Beimel worked the eighth and Seanez pitched the ninth. Nationals starter Mike Bacsik (1-1) allowed six hits and four runs - two earned - in six innings. The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the fifth. Luis Gonzalez led off with a double and moved up when Russell Martin of Chelsea, Que., grounded out. Andre Ethier lined an RBI double and after Lowe walked, Rafael Furcal singled home a run. Martin hit a two-run homer in the sixth for a 4-0 lead. The Dodgers got a break when Nationals shortstop Cristian Guzman misplayed Jeff Kent's one-out grounder, and Martin's two-out homer gave Los Angeles a pair of unearned runs. "I think pitching has been holding us together this year," Martin said. "(But) hitting's going to come along. We've got some guys that hit for a lot of years, and we've got some young guys who can do it, too." Lowe got a one-out walk in the fifth against reliever Ray King and later scored on Nomar Garciaparra's infield single for a 5-0 lead. The Nationals' recent offensive problems continued as they didn't even threaten. They last scored a run in the eighth inning Sunday in a loss in St. Louis. This was the first time the Nationals have been shut out in consecutive games since May 16-17, 2006, against the Chicago Cubs. Notes: Furcal has a 15-game hitting streak, tying his career best. ... Los Angeles improved to a season-best 10 games over .500. ... The Nationals are just 7-18 against teams outside the NL East. They are 14-14 against the NL East.

"Obviously, if the team was playing really, really well, there wouldn't be a meeting," Piniella said. "You don't have meetings if you're on an eight-game winning streak.

According to a report on the web site Wednesday, Mark Cuban is slated to be an owner of a team in the United Football League. The league hopes to rival the NFL. Lining up with Larry Our NFL Czar: News and notes Adam Schein on hot topics Breakdowns of major moves Czar: No compassion for Vick Schrager: Ranking the off-seasons Schein: A sad situation Rookies and vets mix Bill Hambrecht, a Wall Street businessman, and Tim Armstrong, a senior executive at Google, have decided to start up a rival football league, the United Football League, according to a report on the For those worried that the UFL will lack name recognition, Hambrecht and Armstrong already have one owner lined up: Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks. And though the league is having a difficult time finding other owners, it appears Cuban is committed to the plan. The league intends to play its first preseason games in August of 2008. And where will the league find the talent necessary to attract fans? "(Former NFL coach) Bill Walsh used to tell me that the last 20 players cut from every team were almost interchangeable with the last 20 players to make the team," Hambrecht says. So far, the UFL has decided to put teams in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Mexico City. Cuban, unsurprisingly, is considering buying the team in Vegas, according to the report.

(Photos, from left: Rebecca Cook/Reuters, Jim Ruymen/Reuters, Mark Humphrey/AP, Lisa Blumenfeld/Getty Images) UPDATE, 4:55 PM ET: Kobe Bryant did away with all the diplomacy this afternoon, during a radio interview in New York. Asked if there was anything the Lakers could do to keep him, he responded: &#8220;No, bro.&#8221; More on what he said and the possible deals that would send him away at TrueHoops The N.B.A. playoffs may be registering several levels of excitement below frenzy among basketball fans, but the Lakers are trying to make up the difference off the court by tossing together a whistle-blowing star, an owner in jail and a swimsuit model in a Lakerland rumor mill unrivaled since Shaquille O&#8217;Neal left town. . The man often mentioned as the best player in the league is carrying on a furious public campaign to shake up the team and restore the general manager who stepped aside in 2000. , the former G.M. of the Lakers and current Memphis Grizzlies president is reportedly livid with Bryant for dragging him into the fray, according to a Yahoo story. He also considers the current G.M., , a protege and friend. Mr. West&#8217;s friendship with the Lakers coach, At the top of all of this is , the Lakers controlling owner and head of a family that runs the team with all the transparency of the Kremlin, according to a blog called Forum Blue &#038; Gold . Its analysis of public statements from three members of the Buss family concludes with signs that &#8220;power is shifting some.&#8221; Mr. Buss &#8220;is giving up some of his and everyone is fighting for parts of it,&#8221; particularly his son and and his daughter, Jeanie, who had a five-year romantic relationship with Mr. Jackson. As all of this unfolds, Buss, 74, was arrested last night for driving under the influence. Oh, and he was driving on the wrong side of the road with a 23-year-old swimsuit model in the passenger seat, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported . He was later released and a court date was set. It was plenty of material for the Los Angeles Times columnist T.J. Simers All right, who drove Jerry Buss to drink? His son? His daughter? His star player? Did someone tell him Smush Parker wants to return? I&#8217;ll tell you this, because I just know you&#8217;re going to ask, the young lady in the car with Buss when he was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence was old enough to drive. I can also report that her first name was not Paris or Lindsay. (That fellow named Smush is the only Laker certainly not returning next season Getting tossed back Bryant&#8217;s way are reports that he&#8217;s demanded a trade in a post headlined &#8220;The Truth,&#8221; in what he called the &#8220;truth section&#8221; of his Web site. (It &#8220;was created for times such as these,&#8221; he said). [ : Bryant has published a new post about his trade demand. Yes, it is also &#8220; It was one of many places that the master of spinning , fading away and scoring could be seen word-spinning away. &#8220;I&#8217;m not demanding anything,&#8221; he told the Riverside Press-Enterprise . &#8220;I&#8217;m just making a suggestion.&#8221; Restrained expectations such as those may be what&#8217;s in order. Howard Beck of The New York Times says that Kobe Bryant&#8217;s bid is a long shot 39 comments so far... I say trade the spoiled brat. Everyone wants to play on a winning team, and he&#8217;s had his share of good times with the Lakers. Life doesn&#8217;t always give us the chance to demand change just because things don&#8217;t go our way. Kobe&#8217;s reputation for his off-court antics have hurt the Lakers, anyway. â€” Posted by Patsy Robrego I am sure that you are on top of it but here is some more&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. â€” Posted by D 2 the B I agree with those that say trade the guy - he is the male version of lohan & hilton - ok, he is very talented, but instead of handling this crisis &#8220;off line&#8221;, he is trying to use the media to blow this thing sky high, and make it almost impossible for Mr. Buss not to trade him. It seemed to me that he had grown up a bit, after the rape accusation and publicity a few years ago. I guess he decided to get publicity the easy way, since the Lakers were eliminated by the Suns and had no shot at another title. â€” Posted by dave I&#8217;d say keep him and bench him for every last second of his contract. It may seem like a waste of money, but it is a fitting punishment. â€” Posted by Solidad Kobe needs a fresh change of scenery. But Kobe also needs a change of attitude. Kobe is THE best player in the NBA bar none! His idol M.J. had some decent players around him, as all the great players you can think of did. I would love to see him tone it down soon break Wilt Chamberlain&#8217;s 100 pt game; and win a Championship the same year. With this guy I believe it is possible. â€” Posted by joe Kobes problems on an off the court cannot be blaimed on him, the lakers promised him a rebuilt team after the departure of shaq. In his view, and in mine, the lakers are in violation of his contract. â€” Posted by nick Ummmm&#8230;who care about Kobe, the Lakers, or the NBA now or ever? The Stanley Cup finals are on and highlight the major differences between the NHL (good) and the NBA (bad). I can&#8217;t wait until Fitty Cent or some other two-bit rapper buys his own NBA franchise. Long live the NHL! â€” Posted by Thor von Loewen I have always felt that Kobe Bryant missed out by not spending at least one or two years in college before turning professional. It is obvious to me that the guy is immature.What with his rape charges in Colorado, and also the fact that he could not realise that the way to be successful in a team-sport like basketball is to work well with others.More so basketball, where one starter is 20% of the team, and a starter like Shaq, it can be argued, is almost 40%. Magic Johnson was able to co-exist with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, because he wanted to win, and Kareem was part of that winning formula. Kobe got Shaq traded, and now he has to live with it and just shut up. If you are not mature enough to realise that you do not have to have great personal relationships with people you work with, and who can make you successful beyond your dreams, then live with it and stop giving ridiculous interviews as to how you want to be traded. â€” Posted by Lucas He&#8217;s not spoiled, he&#8217;s an ALL-STAR, He&#8217;s changed his style of play to allow the rest of the team to excell, and they haven&#8217;t shown that they can do that. He&#8217;s accustomed to winning games and thats not what the team is doing. He was promised a team which could contend, which has yet to be the case. Hell if I were him, I would demand a Trade as well. I&#8217;m surprised other players aren&#8217;t doing the same on other under performing teams. Did I mention that the lakers are getting warm bodies in seats mainly on his name. Hell I live in NYC and only go to Knicks games when Kobe, Wade, or Agent &#8220;0&#8243; play. Bring Kobe to NYC, you&#8217;ll have a few hundred new season ticket purchases and constant soldout games. â€” Posted by Asa This reminds me of some reality TV show, can someone get them their own, it is LA after all, or maybe they could be on MTV&#8217;s the &#8220;Real World.&#8221; A 74-year-old and a 32-year-old model â€” viagra? Just don&#8217;t quote me on it. â€” Posted by Alex Morales Already posted, but I would also accept a Trade to the Nets.. When they move to Brooklyn, they&#8217;ll be the best team in the East with the addition of Kobe&#8230;.plus my property value will sky rocket&#8230;.. Lets Go Kobe&#8230; Lets Go Nets&#8230;.. Lets go Brooklyn â€” Posted by Asa Kobe signed a contract. Jerry Buss should make him honor it. It&#8217;s high time somebody reminds players that they must live up to the terms of agreements they negotiate and sign. â€” Posted by Mark He has reason to be pissed. And so do I, as a Laker fan. Kobe&#8217;s not the only one who was told that they would aggressively get back to the top. All of us were. I guess it finally sunk in to Kobe that the Lakers were turning in to the Florida Marlins, and that Jim/Jerry Buss didn&#8217;t have the balls to admit it. So they acted like victims, saying that the current situation was what Kobe wanted. So he&#8217;s had enough. But I guess you kobe-bashers want Kobe to be little lemmings like you are (should you getting coffee for your manager now, or at least laugh at his jokes?). You can&#8217;t relate to someone like that. Or worse, you think Hockey is a sport (as opposed to an excuse for 6th grade dropout, alcoholics to fight). â€” Posted by Steve from LA I wonder if all these blame Kobe guys have read the interview, shaq&#8217;s comments, and some of those from the columnists. It all points to Buss wanting to manke money aka Donald Sterling instead of going after Boozer, Kidd, or host of others. I also wonder if the above 5 or so reactions &#8212; all against Kobe have some incling of &#8216;a black superstar should be quiet and happy employee&#8217;. If Peyton Manning or Tom Brady were wronged like this and raked in the media and defended themselves with the what seems to be ther truth would fans react as above. A non-Kobe, non-Laker fan &#8211;Nets, actually. â€” Posted by HSP I wouldn&#8217;t think any team that already has enough good players in place to contend for a championship would want him at what is sure to be a high price. He comes with a lot of baggage, and needs the ball ALL the time. â€” Posted by Matt Cutugno TRADE HIM TO THE KNICKS. â€” Posted by webster bivens Jordan he is not. â€” Posted by APB Kobe goes, stays, plays or quits. Who cares? The NBA is yesterday. â€” Posted by Rocket Ronn Hey, Thor! You think NHL players can&#8217;t act like spoiled entitled brats? What about all the times that the US Olympic Ice Hockey team(largely made up of NHL players) doesn&#8217;t medal (or gold medal), and they huff off in a pissy fit? And what&#8217;s with implying that being a fan of basketball is synonymous with being a fan of rap? You DO understand the deeper implications of your statement are, don&#8217;t you (they&#8217;re racist, in case you didn&#8217;t). In any case, though, Kobe is a spoiled entitled brat. He even was in high school, when he demanded to be allowed to park in the faculty parking lot when other students were strictly forbidden. That doesn&#8217;t make him a bad player, though. Just a whiny one. â€” Posted by KES O.K., listen up everybody, because this is the bottom line on Kobe: Who cares? Sure he&#8217;s a superstar, but he is also an idiot. I prefer my sports heros playing their chosen sport, not exposing their mental midgetry. A fitting ending for Kobe should be for him to end his career with the Knicks, over the cap and unable to give him the championship he so desires. Playing for Isiah and the Dolans must be the equivalent of going to Hell. â€” Posted by Lee Blair I&#8217;m not going to argue with you on whether or not you think hockey is a sport; it&#8217;s obvious that if your misconceptions of that game run so deep, it&#8217;s a lost cause. What I can and will observe is that the Commissioner of the NHL hasn&#8217;t had to ask his players to leave their guns at home. â€” Posted by JN It&#8217;s amazing that some people will always think the worse of Kobe no matter what happens. Even when Shaq says he believes Kobe &#8220;1000%&#8221; when he says Kobe didn&#8217;t instigate his departure trade (and that Buss was responsible) people still won&#8217;t cut Kobe any slack. Also, another point I want to explore is that Kobe-haters often refer to Kobe as a rapist, yet I noticed that those same people &#8220;felt bad&#8221; for the Duke lacrosse team this weekend (when they lost to Hopkins in the National Championship) whose members (3 of them) were also accused of rape. I know the &#8220;race&#8221; card may be played out but why is it that people (especially white suburbia) are so willing to sympathize with white athletes over black athletes. I find this extremely hypocritical especially after reading blogs where people are so readily criticizing athletes in trouble like Pacman Jones, Michael Vick, etc&#8230; WITHOUT considering the defendant&#8217;s circumstance while standing up for white athletes (Duke lacrosse, Patrick Kerney) in similar situations. â€” Posted by Arthur Didn&#8217;t Kobe wanted to get traded at the same time that Shaq was traded to the Rockets? What happened? To the less knowedgeable it appeared that Kobe got tired of being second to Shaq. Now it is proven that he is second to Shaq. I say that its time that he acts like basketball is a team sport and that he is not the king of basketball, that&#8217;s Lebron James. Grow up Kobe. Don&#8217;t you think its time? â€” Posted by Sandra Let&#8217;s go back to right after the Lakers lost to the Pistons in 2004. Kobe said he wanted to &#8220;run&#8217;n Gun,&#8221; like the Lakers of Old. Buss wasn&#8217;t going to pay Shaq 30 million for 1 year, considering his weight problems at the time. Jackson&#8217;s offense wasn&#8217;t built around fast breaks, but on half-court movement. Phil wasn&#8217;t going to change his offense and Shaq said he wasn&#8217;t going to be a Laker with out Phil. An easy way out for Buss who didn&#8217;t want to pay Shaq anyways. Was Kobe used by Buss? Of course he was! But that doesn&#8217;t mean Kobe wasn&#8217;t complicent in the soap opera either. He didn&#8217;t want Shaq on the team either. Now, no one has ever questioned Kobe&#8217;s desire to win; he just wants to do it HIS WAY! Where other people help out just enough that his fragile ego doesn&#8217;t ger bruised. Where you have four or five guys chipping in 13-17 a night while Kobe gets 40-50. Where all his bricks get rebounded by post players who can score the aforementioned 13-17 on garbage and not take away from Kobe&#8217;s set shots. Face it, Laker fans, Kobe may have matured off the court, but he is still selfish on it. Where ever Kobe goes he will NEVER WIN A TITLE as long as he thinks everyone is supposed to help him, and not the other way around. Oh, BTW, Shaq ends up smelling like a rose, doesn&#8217;t he? A Laker fan who put the &#8220;Forum Blue and Gold away until Kobe takes his off.&#8221; Lets start rebuilding. â€” Posted by jason E. Yeah, that Kobe&#8217;s a whiner, nothing but trouble. Immature with a capital &#8220;I.&#8221; Rest of the NBA should just stay away, and let him go to Sacramento where he really belongs. I mean, we could unload the whole roster and just start over with Kobe (that big whiner). That vicious Kings-Lakers rivalry from the Shaq era is just &#8216;bygones.&#8217; Kobe will love it here. Really. A little hot in the summer, but otherwise&#8230; â€” Posted by Paul from Sacto Hockey???!!!1?#@##@@@&#8230;Where&#8217;d that loser come from? â€” Posted by mr vic In the 70&#8217;s and early 80&#8217;s basketball was about finesse and a commitment to your team. Today it&#8217;s about money. Nothing else. The game doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s all about money. Too bad. â€” Posted by randall Also, another point I want to explore is that Kobe-haters often refer to Kobe as a rapist, yet I noticed that those same people â€œfelt badâ€ for the Duke lacrosse team this weekend (when they lost to Hopkins in the National Championship) whose members (3 of them) were also accused of rape. I know the â€œraceâ€ card may be played out but why is it that people (especially white suburbia) are so willing to sympathize with white athletes over black athletes. I find this extremely hypocritical especially after reading blogs where people are so readily criticizing athletes in trouble like Pacman Jones, Michael Vick, etcâ€¦ WITHOUT considering the defendantâ€™s circumstance while standing up for white athletes (Duke lacrosse, Patrick Kerney) in similar situations. â€” Posted by Arthur You are so right my friend. Kobe want more wins not a 7th place team. with smuch parker, terrible brown in it he wants to win and stop hating on the dude kobe a rapist yeah the duke lacrosse player were as innocent as kobe was so shut up and talk about the true subject â€” Posted by Ludger Kudos to Kobe for wanting to win&#8211;because the Lakers aren&#8217;t showing that they care about anything other than filling seats. With him there, they always will. I don&#8217;t blame him for responding to the leaked/planted story that he was the reason Shaq left. He&#8217;s had enough. Mitch Kupchak hasn&#8217;t assembled a winning team for years, so why shouldn&#8217;t he be gone? Of course, it would have been better had Kobe not mentioned Mr. West, but someone else would have. I&#8217;m not sure he has the energy for the game anymore. People always whine about the players are just about the money, but Kobe had a taste of winning, and simply wants it back. What a shame to see &#8220;showtime&#8221; reduced to this. It&#8217;s no secret Mr. Buss likes the younguns. Just read &#8220;You&#8217;ll never make love in this town again&#8221;, in which he has a starring role. â€” Posted by ej Former Oakland teammate of Reggie Jackson, Darold Knowles: &#8220;There isn&#8217;t enough mustard in the United States to cover that hot dog. Every player in the league laughs at him, but as long as he does what he does what he can do, I don&#8217;t care if he craps on the roof.&#8221; Bring him to New York. He and the Dolans deserve each other. â€” Posted by Blue & Orange Kobe didn&#8217;t need to go public&#8230;but that&#8217;s the sports world we live in&#8230;where stars are bigger than their teams. Unfortunately for the Lakers - they havne&#8217;t made a splash with Mitch Kupchak as the GM. Lakers have been too loyal to a guy who has done nothing to improve the team. â€” Posted by Jim I think Kobe going public is a sign that No one in the organization is treating him like the super star that he is. So to fight back he just blew it out of proportion. Life can be frustrating when you got what it takes to get there but you&#8217;re still here. So to sum it up, that&#8217;s the kind of situation Kobe finds himself in. However, Kobe can get whatever he wants, the same way he takes whatever shot he could on the court. â€” Posted by nickelson KB the best player in the league? Maybe if the game is 1-on-1. Otherwise, he belongs with David Thompson, George Gervin, Julius Erving, Pete Maravich and lots of other flashbulbs. Michael Jordan won with centers like Bill Weddington, Bill Cartwright and the big red-headed Australian galoot. Sure he had Scottie Pippen, but SP was a great second banana. Magic Johnson was great, in a different class altogether from KB. Kareem never won anything until Oscar Robertson showed up, and then the contest was a laugher. There&#8217;s such a thing as smart basketball, leveraging teammates. KB didn&#8217;t do it. Shaq&#8217;s record without KB proves whose championships those were. â€” Posted by Richard I dislike Kobe as much as anyone. But people are reacting as if contracts should never be renegotiated. A contract is not a moral promise. It is a deal. Both parties know that the other side may want out down the road, and at least in this case, they have a legitimate chance to negotiate for terms that will protect them if this occurs. It makes perfect sense to revisit the contract if the deal no longer suits the parties. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with negotiating for a release from the commitments of a contract, and that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s going on here. And hey, if the Lakers would take some of our sad sack players, I&#8217;d welcome Kobe with open arms. Bring us a winner for a change, Isiah!!! â€” Posted by JH Knicks would become a winning team once more.Come to New York &#8220;Super Star Kobe.&#8221;You will get a lot of Love. â€” Posted by D.Samuels Nobody in life is guaranteed a happy ending. Just another crybaby&#8230;.can we change subjects now? â€” Posted by eddie You damn &#8220;foreigners&#8221; always stick your noses into something you know little or naught about!!!! If you&#8217;ve got so-called &#8220;former Kobe associates&#8221; spouting negative comments about KB then tell them to have the brass ones to include their names. Your cut throat story broke I guess before Shaq himself came out and said, &#8220;I support Kobe 1000% in what he has come out with&#8221;! Come on, Geek, get some real names and references and stop building your so-called stories on either innuendos or just plain BS! â€” Posted by John Widener Give Kobe what he wants. It&#8217;s his team and he&#8217;s the best shot at winning anytime soon. Kupchack, Dr. Buss, and Jim Buss need to clean their act up and do it quickly. Because of their incompetence the Lakers are wasting the peak years of one of the best players to ever enter the NBA. â€” Posted by Apratim (A Response to Poster #10) It sounds to me like Lakers owner Jerry Buss hasn&#8217;t given-up on his game&#8230;he&#8217;s still driving for the basket even if he does need an &#8220;assist&#8221;, as you suggest, in order to score. Where&#8217;s the foul? Can you blame him for wanting to put-it-up rather than hand-checking his way through the game&#8230;it&#8217;s a shame the whole team doesn&#8217;t share his competitive spirit. And as for Kobe Bryant, spoiled-brat or not, the Lakers need a shake-up! â€” Posted by Tex Reed Required (will not be published) Comments are moderated and will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

Tyner, Twins sweep White Sox Jason Tyner and Torii Hunter discuss Minnesota's walk-off win, completing the three-game sweep over the White Sox. 's four-pitch, bases-loaded walk forced in the winning run with two outs in the ninth inning and sent the surging 7-6 on Wednesday for a three-game sweep. About 19 months after Chicago's World Series title, Guillen was so frustrated by another flat performance that during his latest rant he almost sounded resigned to losing his job. "I'm going to get fired? Good. Is this team going to get better having me out of there? I'd be too happy with it. But as long as I'm here, we've got to play better. As long as I'm here, we have to play better," Guillen said after the fourth straight loss by the Minnesota moved past Chicago into third place in the AL Central, rallying from a 6-1 deficit after 2 1/2 innings against by a combined 19-6 the first two nights, the won for the ninth time in 12 games thanks to a bunch of walks and bouncers - plus excellent defense and plain old good luck. "They compete as a team. They get you as a team, and that's why they win," said Guillen, who alternated between blaming himself and criticizing his players throughout his postgame remarks. Guillen has long been impressed by the , who sped by the slumping last summer on the way to their fourth division title in the last five years. But he pinned most of the afternoon's performance on the visiting team. "Offense, defense, pitching, manager, coaches, we all stink," Guillen said. (1-2) in the ninth, drew a one-out walk and moved to second when hit a chopper to for a possible double play. Konerko's throw grazed Tyner before hitting shortstop in the right knee for an error on the first baseman. "It was just a bad throw, not really a fluke," Konerko said. "I've made that play a million times." 's grounder deep in the hole, but his throw to second was not in time to force Punto. was summoned to face Hunter and walked the free-swinging slugger on four pitches to end the game. "I thought it was pathetic," Aardsma said. Hunter, who finished with three RBIs and leads the team with 45, wanted to swing the bat, of course. He lobbied for the green light when the count went to 3-0. "I saw the ump say, 'You need to come touch first base,' and I was like, 'Oh, OK,"' Hunter said. "I didn't know what to do. It was weird, man. That was something totally different. But I like it. We won." Chicago gave up 47 hits over the previous three games. While Garland allowed just five in six innings, the right-hander walked five and struck out only two. He took that 6-1 lead into the bottom of the third and walked the leadoff batter, . Punto and Cuddyer walked, too, loading the bases with one out and bringing a frustrated pitching coach, Don Cooper, out of the dugout. Morneau hit a sacrifice fly, and Hunter followed with a two-run double on the first pitch he saw to cut the lead to two. In the sixth, Garland gave up an RBI groundout to and an run-scoring single to that tied the game at 6. off the hook. After a stellar debut for Minnesota 11 days earlier when he replaced in the rotation, Baker has regressed in his last two starts. Some of his breaking balls missed the plate by a few feet and he gave up six runs and 10 hits in only three innings - including Manager Ron Gardenhire, however, was most disappointed by Baker's failure to cover first base when Morneau made a diving stop of Cintron's grounder in the second. "Those are things that you can't get away with at this level when you're trying to win ballgames," Gardenhire said. got away with it, though, by doing just about everything else right. (2-1) teamed up to throw six hitless innings in relief, and 's jumping catch against the left-field wall to take a homer away from in the top of the ninth highlighted a series of standout defensive plays in the late innings. "Guys start getting confident, and that's what happens," Gardenhire said. Of Minnesota's 26 runs in this series, 18 came with two outs. ... This was the final game as Minnesota's official scorer for Tom Mee, the first employee hired by the organization when the franchise moved from Washington before the 1961 season. Mee worked in public relations and became official scorer in 1991.

(Jack Dempsey/AP) &#149; Pujols' three-run homer &#149; Rolen goes 2-for-5 &#149; Taguchi's sliding catch &#149; Pujols, Edmonds go back-to-back Cards notes: Duncan, Spiezio still ailing Big inning downs Hirsh, win streak Rox notes: Win streak a total team effort Yanks snap slide with big win over Jays Tribe pound Dice-K in finale Weaver shaky but Angels rally D-backs sweep behind Johnson Zito dominant as Giants blank Mets A-Rod defends controversial shout Lowe, Dodgers blank Nationals Young brilliant; Greene powers Padres &#149; Pujols' three-run homer &#149; Taguchi's sliding catch &#149; Rolen goes 2-for-5 Cards notes: Duncan, Spiezio still ailing DENVER -- Dealing without catcher Yadier Molina will not be easy for the Cardinals. But it will be much more manageable if they have Scott Rolen and Jim Edmonds back. The two previously slumping sluggers continued their hot streaks on Wednesday night, joining with fellow "MV3" Albert Pujols to lead St. Louis to an 8-4 win over the Rockies at Coors Field. Pujols, Edmonds and Rolen combined for five extra-base hits and six RBIs, providing a much-needed boost to a lineup missing not only Molina but David Eckstein, Chris Duncan and Scott Spiezio. "Any time we play, when those three guys hit, we have a chance to score a lot of runs," said manager Tony La Russa. The offensive outburst provided Todd Wellemeyer with the support he needed to win in his first career Major League start. Wellemeyer lasted five-plus innings, allowing three runs on seven hits, striking out three and walking one. He looked shaky in the first two innings, but got through the next three without further damage. A leadoff homer in the sixth chased the right-hander. Rolen's RBI double in the first gave the Cardinals the lead, and Pujols scored on a wild pitch to make it 2-0. Colorado tied the game in the second, but Rolen doubled again in the fourth to score Edmonds, who had tripled. Edmonds picked up three-fourths of a cycle, missing only a double. Since May 14, Rolen is 17-for-47 (.362) with six doubles and a home run. He had six extra-base hits through the season's first six weeks. He has seven in the past two-plus weeks. "I haven't done much," he said. "I haven't lived up to my end of what I'm supposed to be doing. I understand that. I take responsibility. Right now I'm seeing the ball better, swinging better, and I'm being a little more selective. Hopefully I can continue that and everything will turn the corner for the whole team. I feel like I have a good base under me. I feel like my hands are working the way they should. And hopefully, I can stay consistent with that." For Wellemeyer, being handed a second lead was a boon. "That was huge," he said. "We went up 3-2, and I shut them down for three straight. Then we went up big time. So it was big." In the fifth, St. Louis broke the game open. A pair of singles set the table for Pujols, who drilled a three-run homer to center field. Edmonds followed with his fourth home run in his last six games. It was the first time all season that St. Louis hit back-to-back home runs. "We don't have but about 16 home runs between 10 of us, so I'm not surprised," quipped Edmonds. On the morning of May 8, Edmonds was batting .184 and slugging .253. Since then, he's 19-for-56 with six extra-base hits, for a .339 average and a .607 slugging percentage. "It's a long season," he said. I'm just trying to play catchup. Everybody's starting to put it together a little bit. We know that the three, four, five and probably six in this lineup have to produce for us to win." Wellemeyer finished the scoring in the big inning with a single that brought home Juan Encarnacion, who had doubled. That ended the night for Colorado starter Jason Hirsh, and made it pretty much a perfect night for Wellemeyer. "After today, I'm liking starting, getting some ABs," he said. "I love hitting." The Cards didn't score another run after the fifth, while Colorado threatened twice. After Jeff Baker's pinch-double in the seventh, So Taguchi made an impressive diving catch, then doubled Baker off to end the inning. Things got even scarier in the eighth. With two men on and the torrid Brad Hawpe at the plate, La Russa summoned Tyler Johnson -- who had permitted a homer to Hawpe one night earlier. Hawpe drilled a deep line drive that took Ryan Ludwick all the way to the wall, but Ludwick reined the ball in for the third out of the eighth. Jason Isringhausen turned in a 1-2-3 ninth. The win pulled the Cardinals back within 6 1/2 games of first-place Milwaukee in the National League Central. is a reporter for MLB.com.

The Ducks won 1-0. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) NHL notebook: Messier intrigued by N.Y. opening The Anaheim Ducks' defensive stalwarts are hurting the Ottawa Senators on offense, too. Samuel Pahlsson's shot beat Senators goalie Ray Emery with 5:44 left to give the Ducks a 1-0 victory over Ottawa on Wednesday and a 2-0 lead in the Stanley Cup finals. Pahlsson, a finalist to be the NHL's top defensive forward, joined linemate Travis Moen with winning goals in the series. They already mastered the job of shutting down Ottawa's high-flying top line and now are providing the finishing blows against the Eastern Conference champions. "We worked really hard the whole game for that one, but we couldn't get anything by Emery," Pahlsson said. "We just try to play our game, make it easy for us and hard for them. We got some goals and we don't expect that every game. It's fun." After a turnover by Dany Heatley, Pahlsson carried the puck down the right-wing boards, worked around Daniel Alfredsson, and let go a shot past defenseman Joe Corvo, who had his back to him. That matched Moen's winning tally that came with 2:51 left Monday. Saturday, the best-of-seven series will shift to Ottawa for the first time since 1927, and the Senators will have to figure out a way to break out of a scoring funk in the next two games to earn a trip back to Southern California. Teams that won the first two games at home have captured the Cup 29 of 30 times. Jean-Sebastien Giguere stopped 16 shots for his sixth postseason shutout and first this year. He leaped as time ran out and the loud duck call vibrated through a deafening arena. Emery made 30 saves for the Senators, who lost only once in each of their first three series. After a postseason low of 20 shots in the series opener, the Senators managed less of a punch in Game 2. But the game didn't lack exciting, tense play. Emery was brilliant and had the added bonus of a few quick whistles as he tried to freeze the puck. Senators Coach Bryan Murray complained after Game 1 that the Ducks delivered a few extra stick jabs after the whistle and the message was received by referees Bill McCreary and Brad Watson.

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070528.wsptduha28/BNStory/Sports/columnists&cid globeandmail.com: Duhatschek: Bettman points to game's improvements Letters to the Editor Duhatschek: Bettman points to game's improvements Globe and Mail Update May 28, 2007 at 8:08 PM EDT &#151; It wasn't a great time for the National Hockey League to take a week off last week, what with Rick Tocchet pleading guilty to running a sports-gambling ring; and the Nashville Predators getting sold to Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie. Then there was everyone's favorite snub &#151; how NBC, its national over-the-air rights holder in the United States, cut away from the deciding game of the Eastern Conference final to show what amounted to a Preakness pre-race show. Most people probably would have understood if the network had cut away from its hockey coverage to televise a two-minute race they were contractually obliged to carry. The fact that it sacrificed the overtime of a conference championship game to spend an hour reflecting on what happened to Barbaro in last year's race was too much for hockey fans to bear, contract or no contract. Accordingly, it took a brave man to set foot in front of the assembled media hordes Monday and extol the virtue of the product that he was selling. That was commissioner Gary Bettman's duty Monday and true to form, he stayed mostly on message &#151; that while things were not perfect, the NHL's challenges were "a mere fraction of what they were a few years ago." The most revealing moments came when Bettman talked about Canada and the possible return of the NHL north of the 49th parallel. Bettman essentially said the possibility of a return to the two markets that the NHL left in the 1990s &#151; Winnipeg and Quebec &#151; "intrigues me" and that while it isn't something they've studied, "it seems to me more likely than it was two, three, four or five years ago." Years ago, Winnipeg and Quebec lost their teams, largely for building reasons. Winnipeg's new facility might just make the grade by the NHL's current arena standards, while the old Colisee in Quebec most definitely would not. And in the case of either market, a deep-pockets' ownership group would be needed to underwrite the cost of the franchise. In the post-lockout NHL, the going price for a team &#151; based on last week's developments &#151; is $220-million, the price Balsillie was willing to pay to snag the Predators. Bettman spoke in very formal terms whenever Balsillie's name came up and one wonders if he imagines that Balsillie might become his Mark Cuban, a maverick willing to use his wealth and power to rock what is still a fairly wobbly NHL boat. Balsillie isn't in the lodge yet and the last time he tried to buy a team &#151; the Pittsburgh Penguins &#151; the deal broke down before a formal transfer was approved. Given what the sale price has done to franchise value, it is hard to imagine Balsillie not getting the required three-quarters approval from the board when the matter comes to a vote on June 19. It'll be harder still for the board members to restrain themselves from giving Balsillie a standing ovation. When Bettman was asked about the possibility of Tocchet's reinstatement, he answered that no decision would be made until after the league completes its own internal investigation into the case and Tocchet is sentenced by a New Jersey court. If body language and tone mean anything, things didn't look too promising for Tocchet. Nor did Bettman think much of my suggestion that Toronto needed a second NHL team. "I live in New York and I can tell you, there are downsides to multiple teams in a market." On balance, Bettman was poised and in control of the proceedings in his unofficial, semi-annual state-of-the-union address. It isn't his job to slag the league for which he fronts; and in fact, he was a little less Pollyanna about some of its problems and prospects than he has been in the past, when all was right with the league &#151; even if it wasn't. On U.S. TV, Bettman said, "obviously it could be better." On the Preakness fiasco, he said: "You can second-guess it. I do myself." He put the blame for a season that spills into June squarely on ownership, saying that most teams wanted to start the season later rather than earlier. The only other possibility would be to reduce the length of the schedule and currently, there was no appetite for that either. And for anyone thinking the end of Bettman's reign is near, they can think again. Bettman turns 54 next week and acknowledged that his current contract runs until he turns 60. He said he likes what he's doing and as long as his employers feel the same way, he isn't planning on going anywhere anytime soon. It is 14 years now with Bettman at the helm and within the first few years of his reign, the NHL lost teams in both Winnipeg and Quebec. There would be something serendipitous about a return to those markets in the latter years of his career. Intriguing too. "Sometimes intrigue is a fanciful notion," said Bettman, "but if the right circumstances presented themselves and there was interest in a real meaningful way, then we would have to seriously look at it."

The Memphis Commercial Appeal, citing an NBA source familiar with the negotiations, reported the hiring Wednesday. The Grizzlies have announced an afternoon press conference for Thursday to make a "major announcement." Iavaroni spent the last five seasons as an assistant with the Phoenix Suns. The last 3 1/2 years he served as top assistant to Suns' head coach Mike D'Antoni. Considered a defensive-oriented coach, Iavaroni has served on the staffs of Miami's Pat Riley and former Grizzlies head coach Mike Fratello. Fratello was fired by the Grizzlies after a 6-24 start to the season. Tony Barone Sr. took over on an interim basis for the remainder of the season. According to the Memphis Commercial Appeal, Iavaroni was a finalist for the position with Larry Brown, who most likely would have been the next head coach had Memphis secured one of the top two picks in the upcoming draft. However, despite having the best chance at the top slot, the Grizzlies fell all the way to fourth in the draft order.

That is one reason why the defending World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals are eight games under .500. Pujols and the Cardinals look to win consecutive road games for the first time in nearly two months on Thursday night when they finish a four-game series against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field. Pujols keyed a five-run fifth inning with a three-run homer and Todd Wellemeyer worked five solid innings in his first major league start Wednesday as the Cardinals snapped a three-game skid with an 8-4 win. Jim Edmonds also homered and Scott Rolen added two RBI doubles for St. Louis (21-29), which also ended a seven-game road losing streak. ''When those three guys hit, we have a chance to score a lot of runs,'' Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. The Cardinals became the last NL team to reach double digits in road victories. St. Louis hasn't won consecutive games away from home since it won four in a row April 8-11. Pujols knocked in more than one run for only ninth time in 50 games this season. He had 19 multiple RBI games at this point in 2006. ''We haven't swung the bats well this year,'' said Edmonds, who went 3-for-5 with the homer and a triple to raise his season average to .245. ''So we've gotten off to a slow start, and we've got a lot of making up to do.'' Wellemeyer, claimed off waivers from Kansas City on May 15, became the fourth Cardinals reliever to win as a starter, joining Braden Looper, Adam Wainwright and Brad Thompson - the team's three winningest pitchers this season. Thompson (3-1, 4.73 ERA) makes his fifth start of the season and second against Colorado (25-28). He limited the Rockies to one run and six hits in five innings on May 8, but did not factor in the decision. He has no record and a 1.80 ERA in five career appearances against Colorado. The right-hander wasn't particularly sharp Saturday against Washington, but still earned a victory after allowing three runs and 10 hits in 5 1-3 innings as the Cardinals won 8-6. St. Louis learned Wednesday that catcher Yadier Molina will miss four to six weeks with a fractured left wrist. Molina left Tuesday's game in the fourth inning after being hit by a foul tip an inning earlier. Backup Gary Bennett, who went 0-for-4 Wednesday and is batting .208, will receive most of the work in Molina's absence. Wednesday's defeat cooled off the Rockies (25-28), who were attempting to win eight in a row for the first time since a franchise-record nine-game run from Aug. 26-Sept. 2, 1997. Jason Hirsh was reached for eight runs and 10 hits in 4-2 3 innings on Wednesday after Colorado starters had allowed only 13 earned runs during the entire seven-game winning streak. Sinkerballer Aaron Cook (4-1, 4.11) has played a big role in Colorado's recent success. He has won four straight decisions and is coming off his first complete game of the season, a 6-1 victory at San Francisco on Saturday in which he limited the Giants to one run and five hits. Cook is 0-2 with a 6.75 ERA in four career starts against the Cardinals. The right-hander has struggled against Edmonds, who is 6-for-10 with two homers in their meetings.

Scalpers would still be banned from selling tickets within 1,500 feet of large arenas like Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium. Smaller venues would get a similar 500-foot buffer zone. Brokers who sell large numbers of tickets would still need to get a license. But for the first time, it would be entirely legal for average fans to scalp their seats on the Internet.

( The Indians shelled Daisuke Matsuzaka and ended Boston’s season-high five-game winning streak with an 8-4 decision last night, but the Red Sox still finished May with a sparkling 20-8 record and, needless to say, maintained their huge lead in the AL East. Cleveland clipped Dice-K for two runs in the fifth and chased him with a four-run sixth highlighted by Grady Sizemore’s two-run home run into the visitors’ bullpen that gave the Indians a 6-2 lead. Matsuzaka (7-3, 4.83) gave up six runs on 12 hits in 5-2/3 innings in absorbing his first loss since April 17. He blanked the Indians for four innings on four hits before losing his touch. The Japanese import struck out four and didn’t walk anyone, throwing 106 pitches. But the 12 hits were a season high for any Sox pitcher. “I don’t think he located his fastball the way he has and the way you need to,” manager Terry Francona said. “He made a great pitch to get out of (fifth), but this lineup can hurt you. Even when he got outs, I thought he was misfiring.” Asked about his fastball command, Matsuzaka — speaking through an interpreter — said it wasn’t only his fastball, but all his pitches that gave him trouble. He said the stomach illness that forced him out of his last start after five innings in Texas (10-6 victory) wasn’t a factor. “I felt better right away, so it didn’t have any effect,” he said, smiling while saying he didn’t know what caused it. “I knew they (Indians) had a good-hitting lineup, and I tried my best to avoid extra-base hits. I tried to make adjustments in the game, but wasn’t able to. It’s a challenge. I don’t want to be a burden to my teammates. I hope to achieve a level of consistency.” Cleveland starter Paul Byrd (6-1, 3.57) earned the win, allowing two runs (one earned) on nine hits over six-plus innings. Byrd struck out only one batter, but threw 25 first-pitch strikes to 27 batters. Sixty-one of his 77 pitches were strikes. Byrd extended his streak of consecutive innings without walks to 43. “He threw a ton of strikes, it was about 80 percent at one time,” Francona said of Byrd. “We knew he wouldn’t walk anyone. You have to hit him to beat him. He is not going to give you anything.” Former Red Sox catcher Kelly Shoppach had a career-high four hits, including a solo home run, against his old teammates as Cleveland rattled 18 hits, tying Atlanta’s season high against Boston May 19. Travis Hafner had three hits, while he and Sizemore had two RBIs apiece. Mike Lowell, Dustin Pedroia and Jason Varitek had two hits each for Boston. The Sox threatened mightily in the seventh, loading the bases with none out on singles by Varitek, Alex Cora and Pedroia against Byrd, but the Cleveland bullpen came on to snuff out the threat. Right-hander Tom Mastny retired Coco Crisp when third baseman Casey Blake caught his foul pop at the edge of the visitors’ dugout. Mastny then struck out the sizzling Kevin Youkilis. Left-hander Aaron Fultz came on to retire David Ortiz on a soft liner to third after Big Papi brought the crowd of 37,091 to its feet with a blast down the right-field line that would have been a game-tying grand slam had it stayed fair. Cleveland added a pair of runs off reliever J.C. Romero in the eighth to push its lead to 8-2. Shoppach greeted Romero with a first-pitch homer off the Sports Authority sign in left, and Travis Hafner doubled home another run. Lowell belted a two-run homer off Roberto Hernandez in the eighth to cut Boston’s deficit to 8-4. The round-tripper was Lowell’s team-leading 10th of the season. Trot Nixon’s ground-rule double started the four-run sixth. David Dellucci followed with a double and Josh Barfield and Shoppach singles before Sizemore unloaded his ninth homer of the season, prompting Francona to bring on Kyle Snyder. Boston took the lead with an unearned run in the second inning. J.D. Drew reached on second baseman Barfield’s fielding error, scooted to third on Lowell’s wall double, and scored on a groundout to first by Varitek. After almost taking out the cameraman atop the left-field grandstand with a loud foul, Manny Ramirez doubled to right and took third on a wild pitch by Byrd in the fourth. He scored on Drew’s grounder to short, making it, 2-0, Boston. The Indians finally broke through against Matsuzaka in the fifth, scoring twice to tie the game at 2-2. Doubles by Sizemore and Hafner following a single by Shoppach were the key hits. Dice-K whiffed Ryan Garko on a 3-2 slider to get out of the inning. “We wanted to win that game, but we’ll take our nap (today’s off-day) and lace ‘em back up (tomorrow),” Francona said of the upcoming Yankee series.

Sometimes you have to step back. Sometimes you can try too hard," Cubs first baseman Derrek Lee said Wednesday. (Jeff Lewis/AP) Yanks snap slide with big win over Jays Tribe pound Dice-K in finale Weaver shaky but Angels rally D-backs sweep behind Johnson Zito dominant as Giants blank Mets A-Rod defends controversial shout Lowe, Dodgers blank Nationals Young brilliant; Greene powers Padres Shop for official Cubs gear Watch the Cubs on MLB.TV Come out to Wrigley Field in 2007 CHICAGO -- The Cubs, unexpectedly under .500 at this point in the season, held a 30-minute players only meeting before Wednesday's game, endorsed by manager Lou Piniella. "I think it's good," Piniella said Wednesday. "I talked to Derrek Lee about it last night after the ballgame. He talked to me about it, and I said I thought it would be a pretty good idea." "It's obvious," Lee said Wednesday. "We're not playing well. [Tuesday] night wasn't a good game at all. We have to find a way to make it better." On Tuesday, the Cubs lost, 9-4, to the Florida Marlins in a game Piniella said "might be our worst game of the year." Sloppy baserunning, untimely walks by relievers, and a lack of clutch hits all contributed to the loss, the seventh in the last nine games for the Cubs. "I don't think we're playing the way we should," third baseman Aramis Ramirez said. "What's happened this season nobody expected because of the lineup we have, the pitching we have, the money they spent and we're below .500. That's unacceptable. Hopefully we can turn things around today." "We want to win bad in here," Lee said. "Sometimes you have to step back. Sometimes you can try too hard." After Tuesday's game, catcher Michael Barrett, who was picked off at second base for the third out of an inning, said he needed to play smarter baseball. Unfortunately for the Cubs, every baserunning blunder is magnified when the team loses. "You're going to make mistakes," Lee said. "It's as simple as that. When you're not scoring runs, you have to bear down a little more." "Obviously, if the team was playing really, really well, there wouldn't be a meeting," Piniella said. "You don't have meetings if you're on an eight-game winning streak. Sometimes, it's good for the players to talk about things without the manager or coaches." The players weren't the only ones who met behind closed doors. Piniella had a nearly two-hour session with team president John McDonough, Crane Kenney, who is on the board of directors, general manager Jim Hendry and assistant general manager Randy Bush. Piniella called it a "constructive" meeting. "Everybody's on the same page," Piniella said. "Everybody wants to straighten things up and win baseball games. It's good to see. It has been a little frustrating. Everybody's on the same page and we'll just go forward." The Cubs entered Wednesday's game 22-28 and six games behind the Milwaukee Brewers in the Central Division. What's been troubling is that the team is 2-12 in one-run games, and the bullpen is 4-13. However, the team is third in the National League with a .267 average, seventh in ERA, and third in fielding. Statistically, they shouldn't be under .500. "We've lost a lot of tough games late in the game," Piniella said. "You start winning those games, you get more confident that you can win them. You've got to tack on runs. Those are important. Then, when you have leads, obviously you want to hold onto them. It's been a combination. "These kids are all trying. It's been frustrating, frustrating for everybody. A lot of times we've shot ourselves in the foot running the bases. Everybody needs to relax and do what they can do and not try to overdo." Roster moves were not discussed at the management meeting. "I've got the right mix out there," Piniella said. "It's just a question of getting the job done. I haven't asked for any more pitching, one way or another. I've got five starters and bullpen kids and some are experienced, and some are young. I'm fine with it all. I think our pitching basically has done a very representative job. We've let some games get away, but what are you going to do?" Cliff Floyd batted fourth on Wednesday for the first time. He was inserted between right-handed hitters Lee and Ramirez. "We talked about doing this a while back," Piniella said. "We'll try it and see what it looks like." "I think it's a good idea," Ramirez said. Floyd, one of the veterans on the team, said he's one of the players who needs to relax to turn things around. With one out in the ninth inning, the Cubs down 9-4, and the bases loaded Tuesday, he struck out. "We have a good team," Floyd said. "We have to believe in ourselves when we go out on the field. Like [Tuesday] night, that situation, I swung as hard as I could every time. I haven't done that in the last two weeks. I'm trying to do too much. Even if I hit a grand slam, we're still down by one. You beat yourself up about the whole at-bat. Then our star [Lee] does the same thing. That's our superstar right here. You get out of your element. For what?" It's a matter of being more patient, relaxing, and getting the job done, Floyd said. "We have to go out there and believe we can win from the first at-bat or first pitch of the game, and see how that works," he said. "If you put pressure on yourself, nothing will come out of it." Moving Floyd into the No. 4 spot could be the first step. Piniella has longed for a set lineup. "I've tried my [best] to play everybody and give everybody opportunities," he said. "It's getting to the point where we're going to have to get set. I can't do it at every position. We have to get to a point where we can get as set as we can possibly be. Just play the people who are getting the job done the best. "I've tried to be as fair and play everybody," Piniella said. "I've gotten to the point where the guys who are doing the best job are the ones who will get the most playing time. That's all I can do. I can't do any more." Because the bench is so important in the NL, Piniella has tried to give everyone playing time. The positions that are set are left field with Alfonso Soriano, first base with Lee, and third base with Ramirez. "We'll try to get as set as we can," Piniella said. "I might have to play different people at one or two positions. I don't know what else we can do. We've tried just about everything." Jason Marquis took the loss in Tuesday's game, his first since his second start of the season. He had won five straight decisions. "I just didn't make pitches when I needed to," Marquis said. "I've got to bear down when the situation gets tough like that." Marquis heard Barrett's comments and knew the catcher had shouldered the blame for the loss. "Mistakes like that are going to happen," Marquis said. "That's not the only reason we didn't win the game -- there were a lot of other reasons. Michael's a no-excuse guy. I don't think that was the turning point. "Everybody wants to live up to the expectations, especially on an individual basis. We have a lot of talent in this clubhouse and we're just not dealing right now. Everybody's trying to take it on themselves and trying to carry the team. It's tough to do that and do it by yourself. We just have to get things clicking on all cylinders." Barrett was not in the lineup Wednesday. "I'm just giving him a day off," Piniella said. Thursday also is an off-day. ...

Sports - Baseball - MLB: Yankee slugger in scandal Wed, May 30, 2007 QUOTE OF THE DAY Eligible Canadians for the MLB Draft: Yankee slugger in scandal A-Rod has sexy romp in Toronto According to the New York Post, New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez spent the night at a strip club in Toronto on Monday with a sexy blond, that wasn't his wife.(SUN PHOTO BY MARK O'NEILL) Blue Jays attack A-Rod So who was that blond? Return of Doc a boost Clark gets another shot Gibbons calls A-Rod 'bush league' New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez found himself in the middle of a scandal on Wednesday, after the New York Post ran a cover story on the all-star third baseman’s night out in Toronto with a sexy blond, who was not his wife. According to the Post, Rodriguez and the mystery woman spent Sunday night dining at a high-class steak restaurant, before hitting a local strip club and ending their night at the posh Four Seasons hotel, which incidentally was not the one his Yankee teammates had checked into for a three-game series against the Blue Jays. The rest of the Yankees were at the Park Hyatt, right across the street. The Post ran a photo of Rodriguez and his blond companion checking into the Four Seasons, which was reportedly around midnight. Rodriguez had little to say on the matter before Wednesday’s game against Toronto. “Absolutely no comment about anything personal and I certainly don’t think this will be a distraction to our team,” he told the Associated Press. Asked whether it would be a distraction to him personally, Rodriguez said, “No, I don’t think so.” Manager Joe Torre agreed: “When you get into that area, I think it’s over the line. It’s what people seem to think is important or seem to think they have to do. “In New York, there are so many more things that you talk about on a regular basis in addition to baseball,” Torre added. “When I took this job I certainly knew it wasn’t going to be about hitting and running and changing pitchers.” Torre said Rodriguez discussed the tabloid story with him. “Alex is a big boy,” Torre said. “I know how serious he takes his baseball. It really wasn’t an issue for me in the fact that he wouldn’t be ready to play tonight. “My job is to keep the distractions from carrying over onto the playing field,” Torre said. The slugger, who has a two-year-old daughter with wife Cynthia, has been a lightning rod for criticism since being dealt to the Yankees just prior to the start of the 2004 baseball season. Last July, prior to the start of a series against Toronto, The Post ran photos of Rodriguez suntanning topless in Central Park, hours before a game. In March his comments in Esquire magazine on teammate Derek Jeter sparked a controversy, when Rodriguez said: "He's never had to lead. He can just go and play and have fun. He hits second -- that's totally different than third or fourth in a lineup. You go into New York, you wanna stop Bernie (Williams) and (Paul) O'Neill. You never say, 'Don't let Derek beat us.' He's never your concern." Rodriguez’s late-night romp preceeded the Yankees' series-opening 7-2 drubbing against the Blue Jays and last night’s 3-2 loss, that was the struggling club’s fifth-straight defeat and 13th in their last 18 matches. To rub salt in the wounds the Jays Aaron Hill successfully stole home in the seventh inning, the first time in six years a Blue Jay has accomplished the feat. “It seems like we’re losing every way possible and tonight was no different,” outfielder Johnny Damon said following the game. At 21-29, the Yankees are tied for last in the American League East and are eight games under .500 for the first time since they were 11-19 on May 6, 2005, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Rodriguez is a combined 1-for-7 in the first two games of the series. Despite all the controversy, Rodriguez is leading the majors with 19 home runs and is on pace for career highs in both homers and RBIs. Rodriguez is currently fifth among active major leaguers with 483 career homers. - with files from the Associated Press What should Bud Selig do when Bonds breaks the record?

The News Tribune, Tacoma, WA - Thursday, May 31st, 2007 9:14 AM BLOG: The Prep Blog Wall Street Journal Sunday Letters to the editor BLOG: Inside the Editorial Page Nation & World Photos Bars & night life BLOG: Bring the Noise With the Strykers in Iraq Inside the Editorial Page Online in the South Sound Riding Around the Sound Open House: Real estate Today's full text obituaries Place an In Memoriam Way too much Guerrero Slugger torches Hernandez, M&#8217;s as Angels take two of three LARRY LARUE; The News Tribune Published: May 31st, 2007 01:00 AM Vlad Guerrero points skyward after his three-run homer in the fifth inning. Guerrero was 3-for-5 and scored twice to lead an offense that banged out 11 hits as the Angels won the series, 2-1. CHRIS PIZZELLO/THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Seattle starting pitcher Felix Hernandez didn&#8217;t have his best stuff Wednesday, allowing seven runs in six innings of a loss to L.A. ANAHEIM, Calif. &#8211; Both teams considered this something of a statement series, the chance to tell the other something it didn&#8217;t want to hear. So when the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim beat the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday, 8-6 &#8211; taking two games in this three game series &#8211; the message came across loud and clear. We have Vlad Guerrero and you don&#8217;t. Considering Guerrero began the night batting .542 with three home runs and eight RBI against Seattle this season, one might have suspected the Mariners already knew that. Then the Angels turned their right fielder loose on Felix Hernandez, and beat the Seattle ace on a night when the Mariners scored six runs. What happened? Guerrero happened. The 2004 American League Most Valuable Player singled, doubled and hit a game-breaking three-run home run against Hernandez, who saw his earned run average leap from 2.87 to 4.10. Far worse, from the Mariners&#8217; standpoint, the Angels&#8217; victory represented a two-game swing in the standings. Had they won, the Mariners would have flown home 31/2 games out of first place. Instead, they&#8217;re 51/2 back today. &#8220;We had a good trip, we went 6-4, but we had the chance to make it a great trip tonight and couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; manager Mike Hargrove said. &#8220;The way you beat this team is to get Reggie Willits and Orlando Cabrera out &#8211; the two guys hitting in front of Guerrero. &#8220;The last two nights, we couldn&#8217;t do that.&#8221; &#8220;Tonight was a battle, the hardest battle I&#8217;ve had to get through this year,&#8221; Hernandez said. What did Felix think of Guerrero? &#8220;He&#8217;s the best hitter in the game, the best I&#8217;ve ever faced,&#8221; he said. All night, it was a game of attack and counterattack, and solid young starters Hernandez and Jered Weaver were almost helpless to stop either offense. The Mariners got a run in the first inning, when Jose Guillen&#8217;s two-out single scored Raul Iba&#241;ez. The Angels countered with four runs in their half of the first, three coming on a Gary Matthews Jr. home run. And so it went, most of the evening. &#8220;I made a couple of mistakes in the first, a couple of bad pitches, and one of them was a three-run home run,&#8221; Hernandez said. &#8220;After that, I tried to hold it there, and our guys came back.&#8221; The Mariners pecked away but missed key opportunities. They scored twice in the fourth inning to make it 4-3 &#8211; but left the bases loaded when neither Jose Vidro nor Iba&#241;ez could push runs across. In the fifth, Seattle got a double from Ben Broussard, a two-out RBI double from Adrian Beltre and an RBI single from Yuniesky Betancourt, who was then caught stealing. That produced a 5-4 Seattle lead, and Hernandez &#8211; who hadn&#8217;t allowed a run since the first &#8211; appeared to have settled in on the mound. &#8220;I thought he rebounded real well after the first,&#8221; Hargrove said. &#8220;He put up zeros in the second, third and fourth innings.&#8221; Before Hernandez got an out in the fifth inning, that lead was gone. Willits walked, Cabrera singled and there he was, the man the Seattle pitching staff cannot seem to get out when it matters. Hernandez got ahead of Guerrero, who foul tipped what would have been strike three in and out of catcher Kenji Johjima&#8217;s glove. Given another pitch, Guerrero got a fastball up &#8211; and drilled it into the right field pavilion. &#8220;It was supposed to be in and it was over the plate,&#8221; Hernandez said. &#8220;He hit it way back.&#8221; Seattle tried to recover, and Iba&#241;ez doubled home a run in the sixth to make it 7-6, but after that the Angels&#8217; bullpen shut the Mariners down without a hit. One last chance arose in the ninth inning against closer Francisco Rodriguez, who walked Vidro to open the inning. Rodriguez then struck out Iba&#241;ez, struck out Guillen on a pitch in the dirt and struck out Broussard on another low pitch. &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how tough he is out there,&#8221; Vidro said of Rodriguez. &#8220;He can throw you a pitch right down the middle, then throw what looks like the same pitch &#8211; and it just breaks straight down. &#8220;I went up there taking pitches because we needed a baserunner to have a chance, and even taking those pitches was hard. He&#8217;s awfully tough.&#8221; Among the Mariners&#8217; 10 hits was a fourth-inning single by Ichiro Suzuki, extending his hitting streak to a career-best 23 consecutive games &#8211; one short of Joey Cora&#8217;s team record. He would have liked it to come in the second inning, when the Mariners opened up with back-to-back singles, then watched as Betancourt, Jose Lopez and Ichiro failed to move the runners up, let alone score them.

Unlike the most recent challenge -- the WWE-inspired XFL -- the United Football League is prepared to challenge the NFL at old-school football. But the bigger questions facing the new league are who will watch it and, more importantly, who will air it? The sports world was mildly abuzz Wednesday with the announcement that a rival league is forming to challenge the NFL. A league calling itself the United Football League includes such heavy hitters as one of the top dogs for Google Inc. and Dallas Mavericks renegade Mark Cuban as faceplates. The NFL declined comment on the matter, but thereâ€™s no reason for the NFL to be overly concerned about the potential new rival. Why? Where are they going to televise games? Both the NBA and NHL have shown why they arenâ€™t truly mainstream professional sports and each was on display last night. The NBA is at the conference championship level and if you want to see those games, you need to tune in cable channels like ESPN and TNT. Even worse is the NHL. Wednesday night was Game 2 of the Stanley Cup finals and the game was carried on the cable network Versus â€“ which is hard for many casual cable TV viewers to even locate. Even when the league has broadcast games on NBC, an overtime playoff game was pushed over to Versus between the third period and the overtime. Why? So NBC could do pre-race coverage of the Preakness Stakes. In Wednesdayâ€™s Game 2, the 1-0 win by Anaheim was seen on Versus, while NBC carried two hours of a show called â€œMost Outrageous Momentsâ€ â€“ a collection of raucous bloopers and injuries. The same fate is likely to be true for the new UFL. Unlike the last attempt to challenge the NFL â€“ the ill-fated XFL â€“ football is intended to be the primary source of entertainment, not wrestlers cutting promos and cheerleaders that look like no strangers to a stripper pole. They come in with good intentions and hope to achieve the success that the AFL had as being a legitimate rival and the lesser success that the USFL enjoyed by enticing some of the top college stars away. The reality is that even the XFL attempted to make a splash in the football market, and it had a national TV contract with NBC. The NFL has successfully eliminated that loophole by incorporating all four of the major television networks in its latest TV contract as well as working its own NFL Network into the mix. CBS carries the AFC contract, FOX has the NFC contract, NBC has weekly Sunday Night games and ESPN (owned along with ABC by the Disney Corporation) holds the Monday night contract. If any of the major networks were to start carrying the UFL, the NFL could easily flex its muscle and threaten to take off the NFL in its next bid package. Having the luxury of being able to bid on contracts with your own network should be a frightening concept to anyone â€“ much less someone trying to fight against the league. Most people in the initial reaction to the UFL (aside from laughing) are saying that the league will be viewed as inferior because of the power and lure of the NFL. The belief is that the only players that will come out as blue-chip college prospects will be the greedy types that are more about money than playing football. The rest of the league will consist of players who â€œcouldnâ€™t cut itâ€ in the NFL. But more important is that, with the current television contract status of the NFL, all four major networks are involved in deals with the NFL right now and that pursuing a deal with any new league would be akin to financial suicide. With the power the NFL wields at this time, itâ€™s unlikely any TV network would want to upset the league by helping a competitor. The NFL didnâ€™t feel obligated to comment on the announcement of the UFL plan to begin play next summer. Why should they? Without a network TV deal, the new league is doomed from the start, which precludes why the NFL should comment.

Buy and sell tickets to premium and sold out events Search by events or regions: Looking to sell tickets quick? All eyes on Woods and Mickelson By Jerry Potter, USA TODAY DUBLIN, Ohio &#8212; There could be no greater dream match for golf fans, the serious and the casual, than seeing going head-to-head at the Memorial Tournament, which begins Thursday at Muirfield Village. Just having the No. 1 and 2 players in the world at any event is interesting, but having them here on ' golf course in Jack's tournament ups the ante. Woods and Mickelson said Wednesday after the Memorial pro-am that they don't necessarily consider their situation a blood feud. But they have had some icy moments, notably when they were paired together in the opening round of the 2004 Ryder Cup. "It's flattering, at least to me anyway," Mickelson said when asked about the public's perception of a rivalry. "But it's probably not flattering to him." Woods' role is more like that of Nicklaus than Palmer because after Nicklaus established himself there was a succession of players, from to Lee Trevino to Johnny Miller to , who challenged for a while but not forever. "I've had different guys make different runs," Woods said. "It was David (Duval) then Phil and Ernie (Els), Vijay (Singh), Goose (Retief Goosen), a combination of those guys through out the years. As long as I'm a part of each of those conversations I'm doing all right." Mickelson, who turns 37 on June 16, says he'd need exceptional success to even catch Woods, who is 31. Mickelson has 31 wins on the PGA Tour, three of them majors, all coming since 2004. Woods has 57 Tour wins, including 12 majors. This year Mickelson won the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and The Players, which ranks next to a major in importance. Woods has three wins. He was second in The Masters and 37th in The Players. Mickelson was 24th in The Masters. Mickelson's victory in The Players, coupled with his switch to noted teacher Butch Harmon, who tutored Woods in some of his best years, has rekindled the thoughts of a renewed rivalry. "It's a tough feat," he said of challenging Woods. "We're talking about probably the best player of all time." Mickelson said he's not even thinking about overtaking Woods in the World Golf Ranking, adding, "It'll certainly be a while before anybody has a realistic chance at taking on Tiger because of the success that he has had." Woods has won the Memorial three times; Mickelson has never won it. "It's no different than any other tournament," Mickelson said. "He's probably won other tournaments more than three." Woods and Mickelson won't be alone &#8212; the 107-player Memorial field includes the top six players in the world and eight of the top 10 &#8212; but they will be certain to boost TV ratings, and a showdown between No. 1 and No. 2 would add to the interest. When asked Tuesday about Woods' dominance, Nicklaus said, "We don't know if anybody can get to that level. Right now, nobody is."

Sports - NHL - Northern exposure Tue, May 29, 2007 QUOTE OF THE DAY Bettman eyes Winnipeg or Quebec City over Southern Ontario Commissioner Gary Bettman was intrigued with idea of the NHL returning to Winnipeg in the future. (AP File/Paul Sakuma) ANAHEIM -- Winnipeg over Waterloo? That certainly appeared to be the inference delivered yesterday by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, who seemed to suggest that the possibility of an NHL franchise returning to Manitoba or Quebec City is more realistic than the addition of another team to the southern Ontario market. In fact, the NHL commissioner seemed to sour on the notion of another team landing in the Toronto area. "It's not something I've given any thought to," Bettman said. "... I frankly think -- and I live in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area -- that it's tough for all the clubs to get media attention, particularly when they're having tough years on the ice. "There's some real downside to having multiple teams in one market." In other words, the commissioner's message seems to be: If Blackberry magnate Jim Balsillie wants to move the Nashville Predators, the NHL would rather they go to Winnipeg than Waterloo, the home of the Research In Motion CEO. Balsillie's recent purchase of the Predators must still be rubber-stamped by three-quarters of the owners. A vote could come next month. Either way, Bettman warned that all the talk regarding a potential franchise relocation of the Preds is premature. "I met with Mr. Balsillie last week and I specifically asked him whether or not he had specific plans or intentions with respect to moving this franchise and he told me that he did not," Bettman said. "So I think there has been entirely too much speculation in terms of what comes next." The previous time an American-based team moved to Canada was when the Atlanta Flames moved to Calgary in 1980. "With respect to a franchise returning to Canada, that's something that intrigues me," the NHL commissioner said. Bettman was asked why he thought it might work in Winnipeg the second time around "The combination of a salary cap and revenue sharing," he said. "Markets that couldn't afford to compete now can be more competitive. Instead of having teams with payrolls of $20 million US and teams with payrolls at $80 million, we now have a $16-million range within which everybody has to be. "We also have revenue sharing. Some teams can get double-digit in revenue sharing in any given year." Bettman was commissioner of the league when the Quebec Nordiques moved to Colorado in 1995-96 and when the Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix a year later. "We haven't studied Quebec City or Winnipeg or anywhere else in Canada, but the notion that if it could work to put a franchise back in a place where one was lost, feels good -- provided we don't wind up in a situation where we've created a prescription for another failing franchise. "So intrigued? It's obviously something I've thought about in terms of trying to make right something that one point in our history went wrong." How has the officiating been in this year's NHL playoffs? OK, but a few missed calls Disastrous, they should all be fired

(Alexander Hassenstein/Bongarts/Getty Images) CHICAGO—Well-known investment banker Bill Hambrecht and Google Inc. executive Tim Armstrong plan to launch a competitor to the National Football League next summer, The New York Times The league—to be named the United Football League—already boasts billionaire Mark Cuban, who owns the National Basketball Association&#39;s Dallas team, among its owners, the paper said. Hambrecht, Google and Cuban were not immediately available to comment. The plan is for eight teams to begin preseason games in August 2008, according to the paper. The UFL would be the latest in a series of leagues to compete with the NFL since the 1970s, including the World Football League, the United States Football League and most recently the XFL—all of which failed. An NFL spokesman declined to comment. David Carter, executive director of the USC Sports Business Institute said the effort should not be dismissed, but it will be an uphill battle to establish the new league. "The NFL is clearly so very powerful that they&#39;ve done a fantastic job of being able to fend off upstart leagues by ensuring that there are never enough open or underserviced markets available to make a start-up league successful," he said. Google V.P. of Advertising Tim Armstrong (Scott Gries/Getty Images) "On the surface, if history tells us anything, it can&#39;t possibly work," Carter added. "But—this is going to sound like Yogi Berra—history was a long time ago and now the landscape has changed. The right people properly capitalized should never be taken for granted." Success for the UFL may not mean long-term existence as a league, but a place for some of its teams as expansion members in the NFL, Carter said. Hambrecht, the founder of WR Hambrecht + Co., and Armstrong have each pledged $2 million, the paper said. The plan is to establish teams in markets where the NFL does not have one, including Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Mexico City, according to the paper. Cuban is considering taking the Las Vegas franchise. Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, reportedly also owns a franchise in the new UFL. (Brian Bahr/Getty Images) Each owner will put up $30 million for an initial half-interest in a team, with the league owning the other half, the paper said. The UFL will eventually sell shares to the public so that the league, owner and fans each own a third of each team. Hambrecht told the paper he believes the initial public offering would raise, on average, another $60 million per team, giving each about $90 million in working capital. He expects any potential owners to be wealthy and able to absorb losses for up to five years, and the new league is open to a smaller television deal with a cable networks such as USA, TNT or Comcast&#39;s Versus, according to the paper. The story said the UFL could easily fall apart and pointed out billionaire hedge fund manager T. Boone Pickens recently abandoned his intention to buy a team. Pickens was not immediately available to comment. Copyright 2000 - 2007 Epoch Times International

New York is poised to become the latest state to ease or eliminate decades-old restrictions on scalping. For the first time, it would become entirely legal in the state for average fans to scalp their seats on the Internet. And, for better or worse, they could sell those tickets at whatever price the market is willing to bear. The state assembly approved the changes Tuesday. The Senate is expected to follow suit, and Governor. Eliot Spitzer could sign the measure by Friday, when the state's old anti-scalping law expires. "If you have something to sell, you should be able to sell it for what it is truly worth," said Sean Pate, spokesman for the online ticket broker StubHub Inc., which lobbied hard for the change. Some old regulations would stay in place. Scalpers would still be banned from selling tickets within 1,500 feet of large arenas, like Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium, and within 500 feet of smaller venues. Large-volume brokers would still need to get a license, too. It's those brokers who have Russ Haven of the New York Public Interest Research Group worried. Haven argues that lifting the price caps will only prompt greedy opportunists to snap up every available seat, and then jack up prices. "I think this is a bum deal for consumers," Haven said. "As it is, seats to popular events are often selling for 10 times their face price...It may be that there will be some portion of tickets that go for less than face value, but that's not what they're all banking on."

Scenes from the NBA conference finals Check the NBA Index First-round views of the action Scenes from the second round Follow all the postseason action Grizzlies hire Suns assistant Iavaroni as head coach By Doug Haller, The Arizona Republic The Suns' offseason maneuvering began Wednesday with an expected transaction: Marc Iavaroni is leaving for greater opportunity. The Memphis Grizzlies have hired the popular Suns assistant as their head coach. Suns coach Mike D'Antoni, reached by phone, didn't find the news surprising. Iavaroni, a 14-year NBA veteran as a player and coach, has been a top coaching candidate for some time. He was strongly considered for past openings in Milwaukee and Portland and was considered the early front-runner in Memphis. "That's the thing," D'Antoni said. "Anyone who's an assistant aspires to be a head coach, and Marc's definitely paid his dues. ... I don't think there's any question (he's ready)." Iavaroni, who was unavailable for comment, spent the past five years with the Suns, the last three and a half as D'Antoni's lead assistant. During his time in Phoenix, he helped develop Suns center Amar&#233; Stoudemire and displayed a passion for defense, especially in the post. He also had a lead role in the team's postseason preparation, filling the locker room whiteboard with as much strategy, instruction and motivation as possible. "I don't think anybody has worked harder or prepared more for this opportunity," Suns assistant coach Phil Weber said. "Last year, Marc was talked about in some situations, but this year there was a lot of momentum behind him. I think it's a great opportunity for him." Iavaroni reportedly has agreed to a three-year deal to help revive the Grizzlies, who finished this past season with the league's worst record. Injuries were a constant headache, and as a result the team missed the playoffs for the first time in four seasons. Memphis is a team in transition. In December, ownership fired Mike Fratello and replaced him with Tony Barone Sr. In April, Jerry West announced he would vacate his post as president of basketball operations once his contract expires July 1. Memphis will pick fourth in the June 28 draft. For now, D'Antoni isn't concerned with filling Iavaroni's spot, adding that no timetable has been set to add a replacement. "We're just happy for Marc," he said. To report corrections and clarifications, contact Reader Editor USA TODAY welcomes your thoughts, stories and information related to this article.

"Tonight we caught a break," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich quickly conceded Wednesday, "and we realize that." It wasn't their first of the postseason, either, as you might have heard. The team from Dallas that Spurs coaches believe was "built to beat us" couldn't get out of the first round. There was a controversial suspension or two, as well as a famously bloody nose, that nudged them along in the second round. Then Wednesday, with Utah's best player forced to pull his sprained right foot out of a protective boot to play this Game 5, San Antonio surged to an effortless 19-point lead in the first quarter and closed the Jazz and a hobbling out with a 109-84 rout. "They destroyed our will to want to play," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. Lucky and really good. It's a lethal combination. You don't win championships without fortune, no matter what. That's probably why Popovich, just as in 2005 when the Spurs clinched their last trip to the NBA Finals, commemorated this victory with almost the same speech he made in Phoenix two years ago about the lottery blessing his franchise. Asked to explain how the Spurs have positioned themselves to play for a third championship in five years and fourth in nine years, Pop said: "That's an easy equation. It is It is a lot more than that, actually, but you know the Spurs. They're so annoying modest, which is yet another reason -- along with the alleged flops, chops and other Uglyball tactics that they use when necessary -- that this team gets tagged with all the Take a closer look, though, and you'll note that the Spurs cracked 100 points on this night for the sixth time in the last two series, reinforcing their growing Play At Any Pace reputation. They have Duncan looking reborn at 31 -- dominating anew largely because he's as healthy as he's been in years -- and flanked by a seasoned (25) and an increasingly spry , who's healthier himself at 29 than he seemed just weeks ago. Mix in the role players who snap together so nicely -- and Ginobili's increasingly effective countryman -- and there's little mystery why San Antonio will be comfortably favored to take down whoever wins the East. "I can't see anybody beating them," Williams said. "I'm not going to say they can't be beat, but they play so well together." Said Sloan: "They have got guys that know what they can accomplish as soon as they step on the floor. They got a lot of great pieces to a great team." "That's a tough question," said Jazz guard , who's a pretty qualified judge after numerous duels with San Antonio in his Laker years. "In terms of versatility and the ability to play different styles, I can see why people would say that. "This team is different [than previous Spurs teams], I can admit that." It has to feel a bit like 2005 all over again for the Spurs . . . and not just because of the potential Detroit rematch looming. The Lakers, as they did in '05 with the re-hiring of Phil Jackson, are smothering the playoffs with their latest off-court dramas. As my old Dallas Morning News colleague David Moore joked, San Antonio bouncing a Utah team that took the Mavs' spot in the West finals -- a team that was never supposed to get this far -- ranks as maybe the fifth-biggest story in the league right now . . . behind all of Kobe Bryant's various Trade Me/Scratch That pronouncements. We'll have to wait a whopping seven days before Game 1 of the Finals -- which can only help San Antonio, in Parker's estimation, because "we've got a lot of old guys" -- to see if these better-than-ever Spurs can win another odd-year championship and move up a spot or two. "If we don't finish in the next round," Ginobili said, "no one will remember what we did against Denver, Phoenix and Utah." Marc Stein is the senior NBA writer for ESPN.com. To e-mail him, Tony Parker of the San Antonio Spurs celebrates with his fiance/actress Eva Longoria after winning the West. The Beef With Kobe The constant flip-flopping -- not to mention his throwing his current teammates under the bus in such blatant and disrespectful fashion -- has made him look confused, wishy-washy and selfish. I'll give Kobe Bryant the benefit of the doubt by saying he's speaking out of emotion, but many in the public may not be so gracious. I also don't like Kobe sounding as if he's so persecuted. Again, he has a right to be upset after a "Lakers insider" blamed Shaq's departure entirely on him. I believe Kobe -- in part, because of what I've long heard elsewhere -- when he says Jerry Buss decided independently of him to trade Shaq because he didn't want to pay him $80 million. Jerry Buss, Kobe and Shaq all played a role in the demolition of that dynasty, so it's unfair and unfortunate that Kobe's shouldered the blame for three years. But Kobe wasn't the completely innocent, unaware bystander he's saying he was. If he and Shaq hadn't been at such odds, perhaps it would not have come to that. And if he had said, "if you want me back, bring Shaq back so we can continue competing for championships,'' Buss may have worked out a way to keep Shaq. There was definitely a part -- an understandable part -- of Kobe that wanted to see how far he could take a team on his own. Kobe's benchmark is Michael Jordan, and I believe Kobe wanted to see if he could win titles like Jordan did -- without a dominant big man. After winning three rings at such a young age -- not to mention the drama he had with Shaq -- I can understand Kobe wanting to see what it would be like to have his own team. Well, this is what it's like. Complete Chris Broussard blog Not Enjoying Camp Yet Chad Ford was on hand for the first full day of Orlando predraft camp. Here's who didn't fare so well: Dominic James, PG, Marquette 0 points, 0 assists in 20 minutes I think I want to take back all that lobbying I did on behalf of James this week to get him into the camp. He has speed and strength, but he was the only player here to do virtually nothing in the game. If that's not the signal he needs to go back to Marquette, I don't know what is. Daequan Cook, SG, Ohio State 6 points, 8 turnovers, 3-for-10 shooting Cook may have more raw talent than anyone else at the camp, but he's also the youngest player here and it really showed. He had poor shot selection, forced way too many plays and ended up looking very much like a kid who needs to go back to school. I know he says he's staying in the draft, and some team may take him late in the first round based on his upside, but Day 1 was a pretty big disappointment. Dominic McGuire, F, Fresno State 4 points, 2 rebounds I've never understood some of the hype going around about McGuire and he did nothing today to justify it. He struggled to score on Demetris Nichols, a guy not known as a defensive stopper. Whatever his game is, it was difficult to see in this setting. Full Chad Ford column Tim's Recurring Title Quest Duncan in fourth NBA final in nine years T 'n' T: Dynamite Together Tony Parker and Tim Duncan, who each had 21 points in Game 5 win over Utah, talk it over after finishing a game that was one big victory lap. Spurs guard Tony Parker: The outside shot might be less than deadly, but Mr. Lane Havoc has plenty to offer. In the trouncing of the Jazz, 21 points and zero turnovers gave Eva plenty to shoot for. This one was so out of reach, San Antonio fans were doing the wave in the fourth quarter. Jazz center Mehmet Okur: When Rafael Araujo is looking like a better choice in the pivot, by gosh, it's not your day. Or series. Okur, who looked stellar at times against the Rockets and Warriors, had eight points and three rebounds as his team was ushered out the playoff door. Quote of the Day: "We are in the Western Conference finals and we have guys with vacation plans. On the other side of the spectrum, you see a guy like D-Fish who flew across the country to make it back to the game. It is sad to have that. One guy on vacation, some guys having real-life stuff going on and trying to make it back and give everything he has. That's a problem we need to get fixed this summer." Jazz forward Carlos Boozer, asserting that at least one teammate had given up on the season before Game 5 . . . on the same night teammate Derek Fisher managed to make it to the arena by halftime after accompanying his infant daughter to New York for an appointment to treat her rare form of eye cancer. Complete linescore for every player How About Chicago? ... If the Lakers decide to trade him, still holds a no-trade clause that he can selectively enforce, and he would likely insist on a team that would give him an immediate shot at a title. After talking to the NBA executives all of them mentioned (at least) two teams: the Bulls and the Suns. The Bulls are the obvious choice, and a source close to the situation claims that Kobe has been eyeing Chicago for the past month as his preferred destination. To make it happen in a way that gives the Lakers sufficient value in return and keeps the Bulls competitive enough to still play for a title, here's what probably would have to happen: Bryant to Chicago for , and Victor Khryapa. To make this deal work under the cap, the Bulls also would have to re-sign to a one-year deal worth roughly $6.5 million to make the salaries match within 25 percent of each other. So in that sign-and-trade scenario Brown also would have to be included in the offer to the Lakers. If that's not enough to entice the Lakers, the Bulls also could throw in the No. 9 pick in the draft. That probably would be the best deal the Lakers could get. They would fill holes at the 2 and 3, cut several million from the cap and (if a pick's involved) get a top-10 pick in one of the best drafts in a decade. It's a little shakier for the Bulls, because would they give up two key players and replace them with one. Bryant and would be great together in the backcourt. They would still have and could re-sign restricted free agent The complete Chad Ford blog ... Or Maybe Kobe At MSG? Chris Sheridan examines possible Kobe trade destinations/scenarios: Any package presumably would begin with , whose salary is almost an identical match with 's, and then the Knicks would have to include a package of young players ( ) and (presumably) their No. 1 pick in exchange for an additional player the Lakers would want to get rid of ( Bryant has a good relationship with Isiah Thomas, who courted Bryant three summers ago when he was a free agent, and he could probably be sold on the argument that teaming him with a dominant offensive big man, , would make the Knicks immediate championship contenders. More possible Kobe deals is the King what does that make How about the young prince? No, that's right, we have a Prince. Whatever you want to call him he has appeared out of nowhere and made this a series that makes you want to fast forward to the next game. Who would have predicted that a guy who's played in only 60 games and less than a 1,000 minutes this season would have helped turn this series on its head. The previous series against New Jersey gave no indication of things to come either. He only played 11 minutes a game, shot 9-27 from the floor and went to the foul line only two times. All of a sudden he looks like on drives with his attacking style of play. Let's see we have "The Truth" and "The Answer" how about calling Gibson "The Hope?" As in he has given every bench player in the league some hope. The complete Jim O'Brien blog "Best Spurs ever? We'll see"
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18950440/&cid Fisher, Williams can't save Jazz - Wire Services - NBA - MSNBC.com Fisher, Williams can't save Jazz By By ELIZABETH WHITE SAN ANTONIO (AP) -Another dramatic midgame arrival from Derek Fisher wasn't enough for the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night. With Deron Williams struggling because of a sore foot, it was already too late for the Jazz. By the time Fisher arrived during halftime of Game 5 of Western Conference finals, the Spurs were well on their way to a 109-84 victory that sent them to the NBA finals. Without much help from their starting backcourt, the Jazz never led and trailed by as many as 29. Fisher was returning from New York, where his infant daughter underwent a procedure for a rare eye condition. He was expected to arrive before tip-off, but wasn't on the court or the bench in time. Gordan Giricek started in his place, with Dee Brown prepared to come off the bench. Williams started despite a sprained right foot, but had only seven points in the first half. He finished with just 11, well below his average from the first four games, and was visibly hobbled. Without the team-best 29.5 points Williams was scoring in the series heading into Wednesday's game, the Jazz fell apart. They were outscored 34-15 in the first quarter and trailed 55-39 at the half. Fisher had two points. Andrei Kirilenko led the Jazz with 13 points and Matt Harpring had 11. Carlos Boozer had 12 rebounds for Utah. Fisher's infant daughter, Tatum, is receiving treatment for her left eye. Fisher left the team in the second round of the playoffs for an operation in New York, then returned to the team during the third quarter of Game 2 of a second-round series against Golden State. His dramatic arrival, and his five points in overtime, helped the Jazz win that game. The club announced after Game 4 in Salt Lake City on Monday night that Fisher was leaving the team to be with Tatum during further treatment. Team spokeswoman Cindy Edman said the Fishers had a doctor's appointment Tuesday and a procedure Wednesday morning. Williams hurt his foot in the fourth quarter of Game 4. He received treatment instead of practicing Tuesday, then wore a large walking boot at the shootaround Wednesday morning. The team initially reported the injury as a sprained ankle, but corrected the diagnosis Wednesday. Williams was a game-time decision Monday night, too, but played 38 minutes and scored a team-best 27 points. Â© 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Hewitt finds the will to win Australia's Lleyton Hewitt finds another backhand winner in his stunning comeback against Argentina's Gaston Gaudio. Lleyton Hewitt kept his French Open campaign alive last night with a stunning come-from-behind win over Argentina's Gaston Gaudio. Down two sets to love, the Australian pulled out one of his trademark fightbacks to defeat the 2004 French champion 4-6, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 on centre court. The Australian is now on track to meet claycourt master Rafael Nadal in the fourth round if he can overcome Finland's Jakko Nieminen, seeded 20, who had an easy 6-1, 6-1, 6-4 win against Frenchman Mathieu Montcourt. Hewitt wore down Gaudio over three hours 28 minutes, finding his range in the third set after a slow start. His best result for the French Open was making the quarter-finals in 2001 and 2004. Last year, he made it through to the fourth round. It's been a good start to the French Open for Australians, with Samantha Stosur's liking for a challenge and cool head under pressure securing her a place in the French Open third round for the first time, uncharted territory in which she will encounter Czech No. 6 seed Nicole Vaidisova. Stosur was struggling in the third set of her second-round match against Maria Kirilenko, but came back from a rain delay to immediately convert a crucial break point and calmly complete a 6-1, 3-6, 7-5 victory over the Russian. "This tournament's always been hard for me and I'm just really, really happy to be in the third round for the first time," said Stosur, who is due to meet Vaidisova tonight (Melbourne time). "Hopefully, it won't stop here." Stosur, the No. 27 seed, went into the match having equalled her best performance at Roland Garros by making the second round, which she also achieved in 2005. But she was determined to go at least one better. "It was a very tight match and at the end, I think I got a little bit tired," the Australian said. "I knew she was kind of feeling the same thing, so it was just a matter of being out there and really moving my feet, really just enjoying the challenge. "In the end, I came up with the right shots at the right time and won." Vaidisova has played Stosur three times, all last year, and the 18-year-old world No. 10 from Prague has won every time. But the 30th-ranked Stosur has recent form on clay, having beaten then-top seed Amelie Mauresmo in the second round of the Italian Open last month. And now that she has started to enjoy playing on clay, she doesn't want to stop. "I've played Nicole a handful of times, never actually beaten her, so it will be fun to go out there and play her again," Stosur said. "Third round, I'll just go out there and enjoy it and play the way I play." The first round of these rain-hit championships was finally completed yesterday, producing an unwanted record for American men, none of whom progressed to the second round of a grand slam tournament for the first time since the Open era began in 1968. Robby Ginepri was the last of the nine to bow out, losing from two sets to one up against Argentina's Diego Hartfield. World No. 1 Roger Federer was none too pleased with proceedings, either, slamming officials for scheduling his second-round match to start and finish in murky conditions. Federer, who needs a Roland Garros title to complete the full set of majors, finished his 6-1, 6-2, 7-6 (10-8) win over French wildcard Thierry Ascione just before 9.15pm (Paris time), with Court Suzanne Lenglen almost in darkness. "When we shook hands, I told him I couldn't see him any more, it was so dark," Federer said. "The conditions were shocking. I know they want to get the matches over and done with but what I don't like is that they know I'm the favourite and they think I should win in straight sets. 'Let's get Roger's match over and done with, then he's happy, he has a day off.' But what if it doesn't turn out this way? I would be very upset. I already wasn't happy playing so late." Nor were the locals pleased, with hopes of a first French Open men's singles title since Yannick Noah nearly a quarter-of-a-century ago in tatters. French veterans Sebastien Grosjean, Arnaud Clement and Fabrice Santoro all failed to make it past the first round, to the dismay of the partisan Parisian crowds. And matters got distinctly worse when French No. 1 Richard Gasquet had a nightmare against Belgium's Kristof Vliegen, booed off centre court after losing 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, 6-1. Gael Monfils and doubles expert Michael Llodra gave the crowds something to cheer, while Mauresmo, who is short of practice having missed two months after an appendix operation, defeated American Laura Granville 6-0, 7-5. Second seed Maria Sharapova saw off the challenge of another Frenchwoman, Emilie Loit, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) in one hour 50 minutes. When you see news happening: SMS/MMS: 0406 THE AGE (0406 843 243), or us.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) ANAHEIM, Calif. &mdash; It isn't often the Los Angeles Angels get home runs from their 3-4-5 hitters in the same game. They came at the right time, because Jered Weaver didn't have his best stuff. Vladimir Guerrero hit a go-ahead, three-run shot off Felix Hernandez, Gary Matthews Jr. and Casey Kotchman hit consecutive home runs in the first, and the Angels bullpen preserved an 8-6 win over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night. "It's good, because there are going to be sometimes when we're not going to do well offensively and our pitchers pick us up and keep us in close ballgames," Guerrero said through a translator. "We have a good pitching staff, and hopefully all of us can contribute to them." Guerrero's homer was his first since May 17 at Seattle. It hasn't been easy getting good pitches to hit, because everyone is pitching around the 2004 AL MVP. Guerrero's greatest strength is he is one of the game's best bad-ball hitters. "I can't get frustrated because it's part of the game. I've been saying that for a long time," Guerrero said. "I don't get frustrated because I trust the people that hit behind me. The home runs just happen when they happen. I don't worry about when they come or when they don't come. But I'm very happy that this one came tonight." Dustin Moseley (4-0) got the win in relief of Weaver, who was pulled after 4 2-3 innings with the Angels down 5-4. After Guerrero's homer put Los Angeles ahead 7-5, Moseley pitched two innings and gave up an RBI double to Raul Ibanez that cut the Angels' edge to 7-6 in the sixth. But Scot Shields pitched a perfect eighth and Francisco Rodriguez worked the ninth for his 18th save in 19 chances. Hernandez (3-3) allowed seven runs and nine hits in seven innings. He surrendered his first three homers of the season, as the Angels took the rubber game of the series and extended their lead in the AL West to 5 1/2 games over the second-place Mariners. "We were a little disappointed because we felt we had a chance to win the game with our ace on the mound," Adrian Beltre said. "It didn't happen, but we're going to get a chance to face these guys again, and hopefully we can do better next time. We've got four months left, so one series is not going to make a difference right now." Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak to 23 games _ tying his career best in 2001. The two-time AL batting champion is within one game of the franchise record set by Joey Cora in 1997. Weaver had won his previous three starts, and the Angels gave him a 4-1 lead in the first inning. But the Mariners made it 4-all on Beltre's RBI double in the fifth and Yuniesky Betancourt followed with an RBI single that finished the right-hander. "My command just really wasn't there," Weaver said. "The off-speed stuff felt great, but I was struggling with my fastball command. I just couldn't make my pitches and they put some good swings on the ball." Pinch-hitter Robb Quinlan drove in an insurance run in the Angels seventh with a sacrifice fly that Betancourt caught. The shortstop made an over-the-shoulder catch in short left-center field and couldn't get the ball home fast enough after Reggie Willits tagged up. Guerrero had a chance to break open the game in the eighth, but struck out with the bases loaded against Brandon Morrow. The rookie reliever extended his scoreless streak to 15 2-3 consecutive innings. The Mariners wrapped up a 6-4 road trip that began with a makeup game in Cleveland and continued through Tampa Bay, Kansas City and Anaheim. When they return to Seattle, the journey will have covered 6,273 miles. "It's going to be good to get back home," Beltre said. "We finished the road trip over .500 and we could have done better, but it was a good trip." Notes:@ Angels infielder Erick Aybar started at third base for the first time in his professional career. Normally a second baseman, he made a neat play on the first batter of the game, making a diving stop on Suzuki's grounder in the hole and throwing him out from one knee. ... Angels RHP Bartolo Colon's next scheduled start on Sunday was pushed back to June 8, when the club opens a nine-game road trip at St. Louis. The 2005 AL Cy Young winner, experiencing tightness in his triceps since early this month, has allowed 15 runs in 10 2-3 innings over his last two starts.

(AP) -It isn't often the Los Angeles Angels get home runs from their 3-4-5 hitters in the same game. They came at the right time, because Jered Weaver didn't have his best stuff. Vladimir Guerrero hit a go-ahead, three-run shot off Felix Hernandez, Gary Matthews Jr. and Casey Kotchman hit consecutive home runs in the first, and the Angels bullpen preserved an 8-6 win over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night. ''It's good, because there are going to be sometimes when we're not going to do well offensively and our pitchers pick us up and keep us in close ballgames,'' Guerrero said through a translator. ''We have a good pitching staff, and hopefully all of us can contribute to them.'' Guerrero's homer was his first since May 17 at Seattle. It hasn't been easy getting good pitches to hit, because everyone is pitching around the 2004 AL MVP. Guerrero's greatest strength is he is one of the game's best bad-ball hitters. ''I can't get frustrated because it's part of the game. I've been saying that for a long time,'' Guerrero said. ''I don't get frustrated because I trust the people that hit behind me. The home runs just happen when they happen. I don't worry about when they come or when they don't come. But I'm very happy that this one came tonight.'' Dustin Moseley (4-0) got the win in relief of Weaver, who was pulled after 4 2-3 innings with the Angels down 5-4. After Guerrero's homer put Los Angeles ahead 7-5, Moseley pitched two innings and gave up an RBI double to Raul Ibanez that cut the Angels' edge to 7-6 in the sixth. But Scot Shields pitched a perfect eighth and Francisco Rodriguez worked the ninth for his 18th save in 19 chances. Hernandez (3-3) allowed seven runs and nine hits in seven innings. He surrendered his first three homers of the season, as the Angels took the rubber game of the series and extended their lead in the AL West to 5 1/2 games over the second-place Mariners. ''We were a little disappointed because we felt we had a chance to win the game with our ace on the mound,'' Adrian Beltre said. ''It didn't happen, but we're going to get a chance to face these guys again, and hopefully we can do better next time. We've got four months left, so one series is not going to make a difference right now.'' Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak to 23 games - tying his career best in 2001. The two-time AL batting champion is within one game of the franchise record set by Joey Cora in 1997. Weaver had won his previous three starts, and the Angels gave him a 4-1 lead in the first inning. But the Mariners made it 4-all on Beltre's RBI double in the fifth and Yuniesky Betancourt followed with an RBI single that finished the right-hander. ''My command just really wasn't there,'' Weaver said. ''The off-speed stuff felt great, but I was struggling with my fastball command. I just couldn't make my pitches and they put some good swings on the ball.'' Pinch-hitter Robb Quinlan drove in an insurance run in the Angels seventh with a sacrifice fly that Betancourt caught. The shortstop made an over-the-shoulder catch in short left-center field and couldn't get the ball home fast enough after Reggie Willits tagged up. Guerrero had a chance to break open the game in the eighth, but struck out with the bases loaded against Brandon Morrow. The rookie reliever extended his scoreless streak to 15 2-3 consecutive innings. The Mariners wrapped up a 6-4 road trip that began with a makeup game in Cleveland and continued through Tampa Bay, Kansas City and Anaheim. When they return to Seattle, the journey will have covered 6,273 miles. ''It's going to be good to get back home,'' Beltre said. ''We finished the road trip over .500 and we could have done better, but it was a good trip.'' Notes: Angels infielder Erick Aybar started at third base for the first time in his professional career. Normally a second baseman, he made a neat play on the first batter of the game, making a diving stop on Suzuki's grounder in the hole and throwing him out from one knee. ... Angels RHP Bartolo Colon's next scheduled start on Sunday was pushed back to June 8, when the club opens a nine-game road trip at St. Louis. The 2005 AL Cy Young winner, experiencing tightness in his triceps since early this month, has allowed 15 runs in 10 2-3 innings over his last two starts.

Twins 7, White Sox 6 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -The Twins pieced together another small-ball comeback, leaving Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen a little jealous - and mostly furious. Torii Hunter's four-pitch, bases-loaded walk forced in the winning run with two outs in the ninth inning and sent the surging Twins past the struggling White Sox 7-6 on Wednesday for a three-game sweep. About 19 months after Chicago's World Series title, Guillen was so frustrated by another flat performance that during his latest rant he almost sounded resigned to losing his job. ''I'm going to get fired? Good. Is this team going to get better having me out of there? I'd be too happy with it. But as long as I'm here, we've got to play better. As long as I'm here, we have to play better,'' Guillen said after the fourth straight loss by the White Sox (24-24). Minnesota moved past Chicago into third place in the AL Central, rallying from a 6-1 deficit after 2 1/2 innings against Jon Garland. After beating the White Sox by a combined 19-6 the first two nights, the Twins won for the ninth time in 12 games thanks to a bunch of walks and bouncers - plus excellent defense and plain old good luck. ''They compete as a team. They get you as a team, and that's why they win,'' said Guillen, who alternated between blaming himself and criticizing his players throughout his postgame remarks. Guillen has long been impressed by the Twins, who sped by the slumping White Sox last summer on the way to their fourth division title in the last five years. But he pinned most of the afternoon's performance on the visiting team. ''Offense, defense, pitching, manager, coaches, we all stink,'' Guillen said. Facing Mike MacDougal (1-2) in the ninth, Jason Tyner drew a one-out walk and moved to second when Nick Punto hit a chopper to Paul Konerko for a possible double play. Konerko's throw grazed Tyner before hitting shortstop Alex Cintron in the right knee for an error on the first baseman. ''It was just a bad throw, not really a fluke,'' Konerko said. ''I've made that play a million times.'' Cintron fielded Michael Cuddyer's grounder deep in the hole, but his throw to second was not in time to force Punto. Boone Logan retired Justin Morneau, but David Aardsma was summoned to face Hunter and walked the free-swinging slugger on four pitches to end the game. ''I thought it was pathetic,'' Aardsma said. Hunter, who finished with three RBIs and leads the team with 45, wanted to swing the bat, of course. He lobbied for the green light when the count went to 3-0. ''I saw the ump say, 'You need to come touch first base,' and I was like, 'Oh, OK,''' Hunter said. ''I didn't know what to do. It was weird, man. That was something totally different. But I like it. We won.'' Chicago gave up 47 hits over the previous three games. While Garland allowed just five in six innings, the right-hander walked five and struck out only two. He took that 6-1 lead into the bottom of the third and walked the leadoff batter, Jason Bartlett. Punto and Cuddyer walked, too, loading the bases with one out and bringing a frustrated pitching coach, Don Cooper, out of the dugout. Morneau hit a sacrifice fly, and Hunter followed with a two-run double on the first pitch he saw to cut the lead to two. In the sixth, Garland gave up an RBI groundout to Jeff Cirillo and an run-scoring single to Chris Heintz that tied the game at 6. Heintz's hit took Scott Baker off the hook. After a stellar debut for Minnesota 11 days earlier when he replaced Sidney Ponson in the rotation, Baker has regressed in his last two starts. Some of his breaking balls missed the plate by a few feet and he gave up six runs and 10 hits in only three innings - including Rob Mackowiak's two-run homer. Manager Ron Gardenhire, however, was most disappointed by Baker's failure to cover first base when Morneau made a diving stop of Cintron's grounder in the second. ''Those are things that you can't get away with at this level when you're trying to win ballgames,'' Gardenhire said. The Twins got away with it, though, by doing just about everything else right. Jason Miller, Matt Guerrier, Pat Neshek and Joe Nathan (2-1) teamed up to throw six hitless innings in relief, and Jason Kubel's jumping catch against the left-field wall to take a homer away from Tadahito Iguchi in the top of the ninth highlighted a series of standout defensive plays in the late innings. ''Guys start getting confident, and that's what happens,'' Gardenhire said. Notes: Of Minnesota's 26 runs in this series, 18 came with two outs. ... This was the final game as Minnesota's official scorer for Tom Mee, the first employee hired by the organization when the franchise moved from Washington before the 1961 season. Mee worked in public relations and became official scorer in 1991. Newspaper Home Delivery - Subscribe Today Privacy Policy/Your California Privacy Right Add USATODAY.com RSS feeds

Pujols, Cards pound Rockies Albert Pujols speaks with FSN Midwest after his two hits and three RBI helped the Cardinals snap the Rockies' seven-game win streak. But now that he's gotten a taste of starting, life won't be the same for him. "I'm liking starting," Wellemeyer said. Wellemeyer earned a victory in his first major league start, hit consecutive homers in the fifth, and St. Louis beat Colorado 8-4 Wednesday night to end the ' seven-game winning streak. Wellemeyer can now be added to the list of relievers the have successfully converted into starters this season. St. Louis has turned into winning starters in 2007. Wellemeyer had 119 career relief appearances before his first start. "That was impressive as well as the are playing," manager Tony La Russa said. Wellemeyer knows he has things to work on - like a windup. Wellemeyer (1-0) worked out of the stretch from the first pitch. The 28-year-old righty, claimed off waivers by St. Louis on May 15, lasted five innings, giving up seven hits and three runs. "It's been almost two years (since I threw from the windup)," he said. "I'm going to start throwing it on the side." Wellemeyer also had his second career hit, an RBI single in the fifth. "I'm loving hitting," he said. "I'm liking some more at-bats." The heart of the ' lineup - Pujols, Edmonds and - broke out in a big way. The trio went a combined 7-for-14 with two homers, two doubles, a triple and six RBIs. "When those three guys hit, we have a chance to score a lot of runs," La Russa said. hit back-to-back homers for the first time this season. Pujols drove a three-run homer off to left-center field - his ninth of the season - and Edmonds hit the next pitch to right for his fifth. The tied a season high with five runs in the fifth inning. "They have a good offense," said , who had three hits, including his 10th homer of the season. "Albert, Scott and Jim - those guys have been great for a long time. Those kinds of things are going to happen. You just keep playing." Rolen finished with two RBI doubles and Edmonds was 3-for-5 with a triple and single and two runs scored. The win ended St. Louis' seven-game road losing streak. were attempting to win eight in a row for the first time since Aug. 26-Sept. 2, 1997. But they're not dwelling on the streak that was halted. "We need to try to keep playing good baseball," said Holliday, who leads the majors in three-hit games with 10. hit a solo homer to right in the second inning. Hawpe has hit three homers in as many nights and has eight this season. He also drove a pitch from deep to right with two on in the eighth, but caught it with his back to the wall. Johnson gave up a homer to Hawpe the night before. La Russa said he didn't bring in Johnson for a rematch. "I think (Hawpe) has struggled with lefties and Tyler gets lefties out," La Russa explained. Hirsh (2-5) was pulled after 4 2-3 innings and giving up eight runs. He allowed a career-high 10 hits. "I didn't have my good stuff," Hirsh said. "I couldn't find my command for anything." While the heart of the St. Louis order may have broken out Wednesday night, Edmonds said it's going to take a lot more games like this to pronounce them back. "We haven't swung the bats well this year," Edmonds said. "So we've gotten off to a slow start, and we've got a lot of making up to do." found out Wednesday that catcher will be sidelined four to six weeks with a fractured left wrist.

Pedro Feliz drove in three runs and Rich Aurilia tied a career high with four hits for the Giants, who bounced back from a difficult loss in the series opener against New York. The Mets won 5-4 in 12 innings Tuesday night when Armando Benitez balked in the tying run and surrendered a game-ending homer to Carlos Delgado. Paul Lo Duca had two hits for New York, which had won four straight. Glavine went seven innings but was denied in his second attempt at career win No. 296. Lo Duca led off the seventh with a double for his 1,000th career hit but Zito retired the next three batters, striking out pinch-hitter Julio Franco to end the inning. Zito (5-5) turned in his second consecutive strong outing after struggling in back-to-back starts earlier this month. He gave up 13 runs and 12 hits in 10 innings in outings at Colorado and Oakland, then allowed one run in seven innings in a win over Houston in his last start. He struck out a season-high seven against the Mets, holding them to six hits and one walk. Jack Taschner tossed a perfect eighth and Brad Hennessey got three outs for his second save. Barry Bonds returned to the lineup for the Giants, went 1-for-3 with a walk and remains 10 shy of breaking Hank Aaron's career record of 755 homers. He was booed lustily each time he came to the plate. Bonds entered with a .329 batting average and four homers in 100 career plate appearances against Glavine, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He hit a two-out single to center against him in the first inning to put runners on first and second. After Bengie Molina walked, Feliz grounded a two-run single into left field. Bonds bounced into a double play in the third before Molina singled to right to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. Feliz then tripled off the wall in right-center to make it 3-0. Glavine (5-3) intentionally walked Bonds in the fifth and got him to groundout to first to end the seventh on his 122nd and final pitch of the game. He allowed nine hits, walked two and struck out four. Mets reliever Guillermo Mota was activated after serving the 50th and final day of his suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance. He relieved Glavine to start the eighth and received a mixed reaction of boos and cheers from the home crowd.

Shea fans have rude reception for Barry Bonds but later let returning Guillermo Mota off easy. Read Adam Rubin's Surfing the Mets Blog Read fan blog Subway Squawkers With Barry Bonds making his first Shea start of the season, convicted performance-enhancer Guillermo Mota joining the Mets after a 50-game suspension and Tom Glavine seeking win No. 296, new Giant Barry Zito seemed destined for undercard status last night. But after dozens of looping curveballs and changeups that "never seemed to get there," according to David Wright, Zito wasn't playing second banana to anyone. Backed by three early runs - all driven in by Pedro Feliz and all scored with two out - the lefthander threw seven scoreless innings, dooming the Mets to their first shutout loss of the season, 3-0, in front of 41,395. Glavine, who allowed three runs and nine hits in seven innings, deserved a better fate, a theme that is getting all too familiar - and frustrating - to the 41-year-old who is 5-3 with a 3.44 ERA. "I don't really feel like I've pitched a bad game all year," said Glavine, who has thrown at least six innings in 11 of his 12 starts. "If you told me I had a 12-game stretch coming like this, I'd take my chances that I'd have a better record than I do. "You hope it evens out." For that to happen, the Mets will have to be more productive than last night, when they had only six hits and went 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position. "We couldn't hit at all against Zito," said Carlos Beltran, who doubled in the first but was stranded. "Everything was working for him. They scored a few runs early and we couldn't get back. You can't sit on one pitch. If he feels like throwing five curveballs in a row, he can." Zito (5-5) allowed all six hits and walked one. He struck out seven, five of them looking at his big curve, which was generally clocked around 72 mph. The Mets, vulnerable last season to lefty starters, looked that way again last night, but their record this season against southpaw starters is still a robust 11-4. Zito owns two of the four wins against the Mets. While Bonds and Zito were both booed last night, Mota got a mixed reaction when he came in to start the eighth. There was another bullpen drama - the Giants used righty Brad Hennessey to close the game instead of ex-Met Armando Benitez, who balked twice and gave up a walk-off homer to Carlos Delgado in blowing Tuesday's game. The Giants scored twice in the first, but Glavine believed he was making effective pitches. "Chopper off the plate, a semi-line drive to center and a grounder in the hole. There's not a lot I can do," Glavine said. "It's one of the single most frustrating things you deal with as a pitcher. You keep making pitches, sooner or later things will get better." Sandwiched into that sequence, Glavine walked Bengie Molina on a 3-2 pitch. Feliz followed with a two-run single that snuck under Jose Reyes' glove. In the third, the Mets turned a 3-5-3 double play because Wright had moved near second base in a shift against Bonds that made Wright the only infielder on the left side of second. Bonds hit a grounder to Delgado, who started the DP. But the Giants scored a run on Feliz's triple. Glavine stuck around to throw 122 pitches, the same total as Zito, and a whopping number in this era of pitch counts. But he was working on an extra day's rest and will have another extra day before his next turn. While Glavine said he wouldn't have gone out for the seventh without those cushions, he also admitted that he wanted to stay in because he believed the Mets would score. "It was a beautiful night," Willie Randolph said. "There was nothing taxing about how he was going out there."

But now that he's gotten a taste of starting, life won't be the same for him. "I'm liking starting," Wellemeyer said. Wellemeyer earned a victory in his first major league start, Albert Pujols and Jim Edmonds hit consecutive homers in the fifth, and St. Louis beat Colorado 8-4 Wednesday night to end the Rockies' seven-game winning streak. Wellemeyer can now be added to the list of relievers the Cardinals have successfully converted into starters this season. St. Louis has turned Braden Looper, Brad Thompson and Adam Wainwright into winning starters in 2007. Wellemeyer had 119 career relief appearances before his first start. "That was impressive as well as the Rockies are playing," manager Tony La Russa said. Wellemeyer knows he has things to work on - like a windup. Wellemeyer (1-0) worked out of the stretch from the first pitch. The 28-year-old righty, claimed off waivers by St. Louis on May 15, lasted five innings, giving up seven hits and three runs. "It's been almost two years (since I threw from the windup)," he said. "I'm going to start throwing it on the side." Wellemeyer also had his second career hit, an RBI single in the fifth. "I'm loving hitting," he said. "I'm liking some more at-bats." The heart of the Cardinals' lineup - Pujols, Edmonds and Scott Rolen - broke out in a big way. The trio went a combined 7-for-14 with two homers, two doubles, a triple and six RBIs. "When those three guys hit, we have a chance to score a lot of runs," La Russa said. The Cardinals hit back-to-back homers for the first time this season. Pujols drove a three-run homer off Jason Hirsh to left-center field - his ninth of the season - and Edmonds hit the next pitch to right for his fifth. The Cardinals tied a season high with five runs in the fifth inning. "They have a good offense," said Matt Holliday, who had three hits, including his 10th homer of the season. "Albert, Scott and Jim - those guys have been great for a long time. Those kinds of things are going to happen. You just keep playing." Rolen finished with two RBI doubles and Edmonds was 3-for-5 with a triple and single and two runs scored. The win ended St. Louis' seven-game road losing streak. The Rockies were attempting to win eight in a row for the first time since Aug. 26-Sept. 2, 1997. But they're not dwelling on the streak that was halted. "We need to try to keep playing good baseball," said Holliday, who leads the majors in three-hit games with 10. Brad Hawpe hit a solo homer to right in the second inning. Hawpe has hit three homers in as many nights and has eight this season. He also drove a pitch from Tyler Johnson deep to right with two on in the eighth, but Ryan Ludwick caught it with his back to the wall. Johnson gave up a homer to Hawpe the night before. La Russa said he didn't bring in Johnson for a rematch. "I think (Hawpe) has struggled with lefties and Tyler gets lefties out," La Russa explained. Hirsh (2-5) was pulled after 4 2-3 innings and giving up eight runs. He allowed a career-high 10 hits. "I didn't have my good stuff," Hirsh said. "I couldn't find my command for anything." While the heart of the St. Louis order may have broken out Wednesday night, Edmonds said it's going to take a lot more games like this to pronounce them back. "We haven't swung the bats well this year," Edmonds said. "So we've gotten off to a slow start, and we've got a lot of making up to do." The Cardinals found out Wednesday that catcher Yadier Molina will be sidelined four to six weeks with a fractured left wrist. The team placed Molina on the 15-day disabled list and purchased the contract of catcher Brian Esposito from Triple-A Memphis. Molina left Tuesday's game in the fourth inning after being hit by a foul tip an inning earlier. Gary Bennett will get a bulk of the work. "We can win with him catching," La Russa said. And another converted reliever as a starting pitcher. "Anytime you can get a win in your first start, it's good," Wellemeyer said.

World number two Nadal, attempting to become the first man to win three successive titles at Roland Garros since Bjorn Borg in 1980, was in control straight away, opening up a 3-0 lead in the first set. Leading 5-1, the Spaniard was then broken but he underlined his determination by capturing Cipolla's serve immediately to take the set in 34 minutes The second set was even more one-sided, Nadal going 3-1 up, breaking Cipolla again in the sixth game before serving for the set, which he took courtesy of an astute dropshot. The 20-year-old Nadal, whose 81-match streak on clay was ended by Roger Federer in the Hamburg final earlier this month, slowed down a bit after an early break but did enough to stay in control until he earned three match points. A super cross-court forehand winner on the first ended world number 227 Cipolla's suffering in a one-sided contest that laster under two hours. Powerful left-hander Nadal, favored to challenge world number one Federer in the June 10 final, will next meet fellow Spaniard Albert Montanes or Latvia's Ernests Gulbis. Lleyton Hewitt staged a typical fightback from two sets down to beat former champion Gaston Gaudio of Argentina to advance to the third round. The Australian 14th seed looked headed for an early exit but found the inspiration to recover for a 4-6 3-6 6-2 6-4 6-2 win and a last 32 meeting with 20th-ranked Finn Jarkko Nieminen. It was the fourth time in his nine-year professional career that former world number one Hewitt had recovered from a two-sets deficit as he shoved Gaudio to his earliest exit from Roland Garros since 2001. Gaudio, who beat compatriot Guillermo Coria in the 2004 final, has endured a frustrating season but showed his prowess on clay by outsmarting Hewitt in the early stages of the match. He took the first set in 62 minutes with Hewitt unable to convert any of his four break points and followed up with the second as he closed on victory. But Hewitt is a redoubtable battler and by cutting back unforced errors he took the third with breaks in the third and seventh games. With the bit between his teeth, Hewitt leveled affairs after nearly three hours on court and there was only one winner thereafter as Gaudio's confidence waned. Hewitt broke in the first and fifth games of the decider and took the match with a love service game when Gaudio hit a lazy, tired forehand long. Hewitt is headed for a fourth round clash with defending champion Rafael Nadal, a repeat of 2006, while earlier Serbian sixth seed Novak Djokovic, tipped as an outsider for the title, needed four sets to get past French world number 306 Laurent Recouderc. Former Australian Open runner-up Marcos Baghdatis, the 16th seeded Cypriot, also made the third round with a straight sets triumph over Denmark's Kristian Pless.

By RUSTY MILLER AP Sports Writer &copy; 2007 The Associated Press DUBLIN, Ohio &mdash; Masters champion Zach Johnson is here. So are eight of the top 10 players in the world. Yet all anyone seems to notice is the looming duel between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. Both were peppered with questions about a potential showdown in this week's Memorial Tournament. Woods is No. 1 on the planet by acclaim, not even close. But that doesn't stop everybody from trying to speculate about who could sneak up and steal his crown. "I've had different guys make different runs," Woods said after Wednesday's pro-am at Muirfield Village Golf Club. "It was (David) Duval and then probably Phil and Ernie (Els), Vijay (Singh), Goose (Retief Goosen) &mdash; a combination of those guys throughout the years." With Mickelson coming off a big win at The Players Championship three weeks ago, some are saying he may be primed to challenge Woods at the Memorial and then in two weeks at the U.S. Open at Oakmont. Mickelson isn't so sure. "It's flattering &mdash; to me, anyway," he joked of the comparisons between him and Woods. "Probably not to him, but it's flattering to me." It seems that every time Mickelson gets a big win &mdash; the Masters in 2004, the PGA Championship in 2005, the Masters again in 2006 &mdash; it gets Woods' attention. A year ago, for instance, Mickelson won at Augusta and was in position to take his second major in a row before hitting that hideous drive on the final hole that cost him the Open at Winged Foot. Still grieving the loss of his father, Woods wasn't a factor there, but then turned around and won the last two majors, the British Open and PGA. With Woods facing impending fatherhood and the changes that can bring, now could be the time for Mickelson to finally challenge for the top spot in the world. Woods doesn't seem to be conceding anything, though. "As long as I'm up there in the conversation, I'm doing all right," Woods said. "I keep pushing myself pretty hard, regardless. I always try and get better. You can't stay stagnant in any sport. You've always got to keep getting better because you know the guys are training harder, they're finding their game, they're in the gym, you're getting better athletes playing the game. So you've got to keep getting better." Mickelson, leading the tour in putting average, knows how difficult the task is. "It's a tough feat. I mean, we're talking about probably the best player of all time," he said. Memorial Tournament founder Jack Nicklaus was asked if anyone is capable of pressing Woods. "All I know is that Tiger is dominating what's going on. And when he plays and when he's playing well, he is really difficult to beat," Nicklaus said. "We can say that the guys today can't finish and Tiger is the only guy that can play, or we can say that the guys today are really, really good and Tiger is just way above them. We never will have an answer for that." Either way, Mickelson is not giving up. He's lost weight, is halfway through restructuring his swing and is optimistic heading into the Memorial &mdash; a tournament Woods has won three times. Mickelson has never finished in the top three. "A lot of great players have won this tournament. I have not," he said. "It's one of the tour events that I would very much like to win." The field mirrors that of a major. Nine of the top 10 money-winners are on hand, along with former Memorial winners Els, Jim Furyk, Singh, Tom Lehman and Paul Azinger. Johnson, still on a victory lap after winning the Masters in April and the AT&T Classic two weeks ago, burns to remain in such elite company. "This is one of my favorite places to be," said Johnson, who tied for second at the Memorial a year ago, two shots behind winner Carl Pettersson. "Golfwise, I absolutely love it. If you find a complaint here, it's hard." Sorenstam's back - literally this time Is Mickelson ready to challenge Woods?

See the Bulls in action! Kobe Bryant is being traded to the Bulls. No, wait, Kobe Bryant is not being traded to the Bulls. being traded to the Bulls. No, he's not being traded to the Bulls. That's the big problem with this story. By the time you're reading this, Bryant could have asked to be traded or not traded from the Lakers six more times. This is what I know for sure: Kobe Bryant is not being traded this summer, not to anyone, no matter what he says. The Lakers will trade for someone. My guess is Jermaine O'Neal, but if that doesn't happen, or if it does and it doesn't work out, it's not inconceivable Bryant could be with the Bulls in 2008-09. On a personal level, I have to thank Bryant because this allows me to pay less attention to the miserable Eastern Conference finals going on in Detroit and Cleveland. That's the reason, I think, Bryant had a basketball breakdown this week. He has been watching someone named "Booby" Gibson become a hero for the Cavaliers and Utah's Deron Williams skip the five-year waiting period for induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame and Derek Fisher, his old teammate who couldn't break down a man with a cane off the dribble, and some guy on the Spurs with a name and looks like Fabio being celebrated and he's at his window screaming, " I'm home because I'm playing with Smush Parker and Kwame Brown. Aaaggghhh!!!" This is why we really love these guys and this game. To recap, Bryant's breakdown began last week when a Los Angeles Times reporter called to ask how things were going, and Bryant reiterated his position that he's unhappy with the team and wants the Lakers to make some big moves this summer. Given that Los Angeles doesn't have an NFL team and it still doesn't know what to make of baseball and Jack Nicholson doesn't go to those games anyway, the Times basically devoted a special section to the story. So then an ESPN reporter called, and now Bryant was into it. He offered a less-than-supportive vote of confidence for general manager Mitch Kupchak and said he wanted former general manager Jerry West back to run the team because, geez, Kupchak got us Smush Parker and Kwame Brown. West is retiring from the Memphis Grizzlies next month and didn't help matters by saying he always had been a Laker. Ooops. West, who handpicked Kupchak as his successor, quickly said he's not going anywhere. Then Bryant did his first crossover and said he was merely trying to help. "I would love for [West] to be a part of this," Bryant said. "But it's not something where I demand he comes here. All I can do is offer my thoughts. I love being a Laker. I want to retire a Laker. I want to fix this, or at least help any way I can. "I haven't demanded a trade, I haven't asked for a trade, I haven't said anything like that. That's not something I even want to think about." Then there was an anonymous quote in the Times on Tuesday that Bryant was responsible for forcing the trade of Shaquille O'Neal. Angered by that, Bryant went on local radio in Los Angeles to denounce the Lakers, saying the front office was a mess and it had misled him about plans to refurbish the team. Wednesday morning, still simmering, Bryant bubbled over and upped the volume on ESPN radio by saying he wanted to be traded, knocking Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton out of the headlines for a few hours.Reports had his agent informing the Lakers there was nothing they could do to change his mind and he had begun contacting teams, including the Bulls. A few hours later, after a conversation with Phil Jackson and undoubtedly a meditation session and some chanting, Bryant was quoted by the Los Angeles Daily News as saying: "I can only hope they do something, because I don't want to go anyplace else. I want to stay here. Phil said, `Let us try to work that out, figure things out.' That made me feel a lot better. Phil is a guy I leaned on all season for clarity and hope. When Phil and I talked, it was an emotional conversation. I want to stay here. This is my team. I love it here." Copyright & terms of service

They knew anyway. "Everybody knew I was doing it, in the whole park," Patterson said. Erik Bedard and Gil Meche had allowed only zeros for seven innings, making it clear this game would not be won by mashing the ball. The extra rest of a 1 hour, 36 minute rain delay does Erik Bedard some good as he pitches eight innings for the first time this season. (Charlie Riedel - AP) Erik Bedard goes eight innings as Baltimore gets its first of the season with a 3-0 win over the Royals to complete a road sweep. Brian Burres has been 'sneaky' in his success. The Orioles' brass must break its decade-old habit of blaming a manager for losses and hold its players accountable. Box score: Orioles 3, Royals 0 | Enhancing a Legacy Save & Share Article So third baseman Esteban German was creeping, then charging down the line, but that didn't matter either. Not the way Patterson runs, and not the way he bunted in the eighth inning, a play that set up Jay Payton's game-winning RBI single and, after a two-run insurance homer by Nick Markakis in the ninth, a 3-0 victory for the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday night. It took a while (rain delayed the start of the game 1 hour 36 minutes) and placed some undue stress on Bedard, who pitched a season-high eight innings, allowed four hits and won for the first time since April 18. "That's a long time ago," he said. After it all happened, though, the Orioles completed a sweep of the Royals and moved to one game under .500 at 26-27 -- their best record since May 11 -- having won five straight. Despite the late-game offensive heroics, Bedard was the star. He has experienced frustration adjusting to the life of an ace, having to face the league's best pitchers every start. His teammates knew of his winning drought, and they wanted to get him a win. In the end, really, he got it himself. "He sucked it up for us real good," Manager Sam Perlozzo said. "I'm sure the lack of wins is probably on his mind a little bit." Payton won the game when he sharply grounded a low slider to the left side. The pitch may have been out of the strike zone, Payton said, and he got out in front of it. But he smacked it hard enough so it skidded through the infield, just under Tony PeÃ±a Jr.'s glove. Pinch runner Freddie Bynum jogged home from third with the game's first run. "He's just a competitor," Perlozzo said. "He bears down and likes being the guy." But first, Patterson's speed allowed it to happen. He dug in against Meche in the eighth, after Ramon Hernandez walked and Bynum replaced him. Patterson took the first pitch after squaring, then nudged the second toward German. German charged almost as Meche wound up. Patterson flew out of the batter's box before the ball even landed and sprinted to first. It was a routine sacrifice bunt, but it wasn't, not how Patterson runs. German pounced on the ball and rifled it to first. Patterson beat the throw without question. Rather than the expected result, a man on second with one out, the Orioles had two men on with no out. The difference allowed Brian Roberts to lay down another bunt, this one less harrowing for Kansas City, but just as effective for the Orioles. Payton followed with his game-winner. "I love playing the game," Payton said. "That's what it's all about, trying to win." The Orioles hadn't given Bedard much, but it was enough. He pitched his best game this season, going deeper than he had before and striking out five, including his last batter. After that, he pumped his fist, a rare show of emotion. "No runs, eight innings," Bedard said. "I was happy." "I know Erik a little bit better," Perlozzo said. "I'm around him a lot. He's a lot more competitive than you think." After Bedard plowed through each inning, he had to sit in the dugout and watch Baltimore's hitters flail, which was nothing new for him. In his previous seven starts, the Orioles had scored 11 runs while he was in the game, which comes to 2.2 runs per nine innings. Bedard won none of those despite a combined 3.43 ERA. It seemed like it might happen again, as Bedard matched Meche inning for inning. He was matched up with another team's best pitcher. Late into Wednesday night, there was none better than Bedard.

Columnist Grant Boone explores the idea that Tiger Woods could create his own golf circuit, and what that would mean to the PGA TOUR and to golf fans everywhere. A Tiger Woods golf circuit could generate great ratings and still allow Woods his chase of history. (Getty Images) Stanford leads Coastal Carolina as the men&#39;s NCAA finals get under way Ferguson on Golf: Jack and Tiger are at home on the range at Muirfield Memorial Notebook: Case of beer gets the best of Parnevik&#39;s toe After two months off, Sorenstam is ready to play again at the Ginn Tribute A year after barely missing a 59, Archer returns to the Wales Open Grant Boone, special to PGA.com 05.30.2007 08:48 pm (ET) First off, I&#39;m going to risk being trite to extend admittedly generic but heartfelt Memorial Day thanks to anyone and everyone who&#39;s put himself or herself in harm&#39;s way on behalf of this nation. I have conflicting thoughts when I think of conflicts. I&#39;m anti-war but pro-soldier. I&#39;m pro-U.S. but not anti-everyone else. I could probably be persuaded into believing there have been times and places in which war was either justified or inevitable. I get the idea that there are truly evil people on the planet who, unchecked, will wreak havoc on innocent lives. Generally speaking, though, I think war is usually waged by individuals or groups with something significant to gain. As for what&#39;s presently going on in Iraq, I think we can all agree -- however much you like (me, on some days) or dislike (me, on others) George W. Bush -- that we haven&#39;t seen an exit strategy this poorly conceived or executed since Jean V.D. Velde at the 1999 British Open. Still, that doesn&#39;t negate the sacrifices made by the U.S. military. And the idea that someone would risk his or her life to allow me the freedom to sit here and take the occasional potshot at The First Consonant is mind-boggling. There is scarcely a greater notion concocted by humankind than that of a person laying down his or her life for another. To all of you who&#39;ve served in America&#39;s armed forces, I thank you. Second, I couldn&#39;t help but think of professional golf as I watched the Indianapolis 500, what there was of it, for a couple of reasons. One, reducing what&#39;s supposed to be the crown jewel of your sport to by 34 laps is tantamount to abdicating your throne. Imagine the USGA shortening the U.S. Open to a 54-hole event. You&#39;d sooner see David Fay in a necktie. Officials at the Indy 500, on the other hand, called the race early but still bequeathed their wreath and jug to the putative winner, Dario Franchitti. They should&#39;ve given him skim milk. It&#39;s yet another example of how one of America&#39;s great sporting events is stuck in the pits. While the weather struck a blow against the race this year, the damage sustained 11 years ago was purely self-inflicted and is the other reason I thought about golf as I watched the fits and starts in Indy. The Indianapolis 500 was once the pace car of what was then the CART series, far and away the most important of the 15 or so annual races. The field each year was filled with the best drivers of that league. CART racing at the time was a fringe sport, for sure, but its stars were utterly mainstream and their names still resonate: Foyt, Andretti, Unser. In 1996, Tony George, owner of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, brought out a monkey wrench. He not only created a rival circuit, the Indy Racing League, he went one worse and reserved most of the spots on the Indy 500 grid for drivers in his new alliance. It splintered the sport and watered down one of America&#39;s great sporting events. Case in point: the winner of the first 500 after the split was Buddy Lazier. Not exactly a name to go alongside the aforementioned appellations in the pantheon of racing heroes. It&#39;s pronounced "luh ZEER," though it&#39;s true the general sports fan has been lazier in following open wheel racing in the U.S. ever since. I thought about all of this in relation to my own conjecture of a Tiger Tour. I&#39;ve wondered, along with others, what would happen if Tiger Woods -- fully aware of the staggering disparity in television ratings between events he plays and those he doesn&#39;t -- decided to renounce his PGA Tour membership and create his own series of tournaments. He could stage whatever number he preferred -- maybe 10 to 12 -- with small, elite fields and find his own tournament sponsors and broadcast partners. CBS, NBC, and Golf Channel are already shelling out a billion dollars for PGA Tour rights even though they know Woods won&#39;t play in two-thirds of the tournaments each season. The 12-14 he does play make it worth it to them. How much would ESPN/ABC pony up for a dozen Tiger Tour events with a guarantee of Woods&#39; presence in each? Here&#39;s where this idea is disturbingly different from what happened with CART and the Indy Racing League: Tiger would still compete in each of the four major championships because none of them are run by the PGA Tour. If, for example, Augusta National decided to start its own tour and insist that golfers play those events to earn a spot in the Masters, that tournament would eventually become irrelevant if the field didn&#39;t include Woods and the other best players of the day. That&#39;s essentially what Tony George did when he made the Indy 500 a closed shop. But Tiger could have the best of both worlds: his own tour and the opportunity to continue his pursuit of the one record he cares about most, Nicklaus&#39; 18 majors. Remember, Woods can play the Masters, British Open, and PGA Championship every year as a past champion. The U.S. Open gives its winners a 10-year exemption, meaning Woods is in that field through at least 2012. That would give him six more years to win another Open and extend his free pass. Even if he didn&#39;t win another one by then, I have a hunch he could snag one of those USGA special exemptions. In creating a rival league, Woods would obviously surrender his PGA Tour membership. And even if the Tour blackballed him from The Players or World Golf Championships by rearranging the eligibility criteria, he&#39;d still have a full season playing his own tour, the four majors, and whatever Tour events he wanted on sponsors&#39; invitations. (My guess is that Woods could finagle an exemption or two from Buick.) There would be significant obstacles, not the least of which might be Tiger even considering the possibility and his chief rivals, et al, being willing to leave the PGA Tour, too. The irony, though, is that the outcome -- at least in the short run -- could actually have the opposite effect of what happened with CART and the IRL. You&#39;re telling me golf fans wouldn&#39;t watch Tiger, Phil, Ernie, Vijay, Boo (just seeing if you&#39;re still with me), and 50 other solid players duke it out for $5 million purses on classic courses like Pinehurst, Pebble, and Winged Foot? (They might have a tough time booking the TPC Sawgrass, but I bet they could get a deal on the courses currently being concocted by the good folks at Tiger Woods Design.) Of course we&#39;d watch. And we&#39;d still get Tiger and all of those players going at it in the tournaments that matter most to us and them, the majors. I&#39;m not suggesting any of this is going to happen. What I am saying is that it could happen, which is why PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem walks such a fine line. He needs to come off as his own man while at the same time making sure Woods is happy. Which might explain the FedEx Cup. For all the talk about the $10 million first prize, the most notable characteristic is the shortened season, which Woods has wanted for years. That fine line might also explain why the Tour stiffed its rank-and-file by making sure the new event in Washington, D.C., which is being hosted by Tiger and which benefits Woods&#39; eponymous foundation, has the limited field Tiger wanted. It will be interesting to see if that event, titled the AT&T National, proves to placate Woods or give him a taste of what the Tiger Tour might one day be. All of this must surely raise a flag at PGA Tour headquarters, if not red then at least a yellow for caution.

Hambrecht + Company has since become so threatening to traditional underwriters that they often refuse to be involved in any I.P.O. in which his firm takes part. Skip to next paragraph Illustration by David Johnson The New York Times Go to Complete Coverage » And now, at an age when most people are well into retirement, he has decided to tackle the establishment again. This time, though, the establishment isn’t Wall Street. It’s the National Football League. Bill Hambrecht, you see, is starting up a professional football league. So far, he and his partner, Tim Armstrong, a senior executive at Google, have pledged $2 million each. They’ve hired a C.E.O. and a C.O.O., both of whom cut their teeth at the National Basketball Association. They’ve got a name: the United Football League. And they’ve lined up a wealthy, well-known businessman as their first owner: , the billionaire who owns the N.B.A.’s . Like Hambrecht, Cuban loves nothing more than confronting the status quo. Obviously, the U.F.L. is still in the early planning stages. It hasn’t yet hired a single football person and is still hunting for seven more owners with Cuban’s deep pockets and contrarian mindset, so that the league can begin with eight teams. It could easily fall apart before the first kickoff. Indeed, there has already been one setback: Boone Pickens, the oilman turned-corporate-raider-turned-billionaire-hedge-fund manager, recently abandoned his intention to buy a team. But Cuban remains committed, and if all goes according to plan, the U.F.L. will play its first preseason games in August 2008. I kid you not. Hambrecht has been thinking unconventional thoughts about pro football for a long time. Back in the early 1980s, he was a minority partner in the Oakland Invaders, one of the original franchises of the late, unlamented United States Football League, a spring league that played its games during the N.F.L.’s off-season. The U.S.F.L. folded in 1985, after three seasons. “It was started by a bunch of guys who were riding high because of the S.&L. boom,” Hambrecht recalls. “As soon as the boom turned to bust, the league went broke.” Most of us would go through such an experience and conclude, Never again. Not Hambrecht. He was convinced that the U.S.F.L. could have worked with a smarter game plan and owners who were more patient. At various times he discussed a new league with NBC, CBS and Fox, but those talks went nowhere. Then one day last year, Hambrecht told Tim Armstrong, whom he met when his firm helped manage Google’s initial public offering, about his dream of a new football league. The more Armstrong heard, the more excited he got. By October, the two men had committed their $2 million, hired their first three executives (Bill Daugherty, the C.E.O.; Jon Brod, the C.O.O.; and Andrew Goldberg, a senior analyst) and begun an extensive study to see if the idea was really feasible. Let’s now take a moment to consider what the U.F.L. will be up against: a monopolistic sports league utterly unafraid to take advantage of its monopoly power. Over the years, the N.F.L. has squashed four competitors, most recently the NBC- and World Wrestling Federation-backed XFL in 2001. Right now, Arena Football is an alternate league, but it’s a marginal thing, with negligible TV ratings and an average of 12,000 fans per game. And with eight players to a side, games in the N.F.L.’s off-season and a field that looks like a hockey rink, it’s not exactly “real” football. Where others might be daunted by the N.F.L.’s success and power, though, Hambrecht came to believe its monopoly status gave him an opening. “I really started thinking hard about this after the Los Angeles Rams left to go to St. Louis and the Houston Oilers went to Nashville,” he told me over drinks recently. “Why do you leave two of the top 10 TV markets in the country for these two smaller markets?” The answer, of course, is that the N.F.L. doesn’t really have to worry about where its teams are located, since most games are televised and the bulk of the league’s revenues come from its network contracts. What’s more, with the right stadium deal and enough corporate sponsorship, team owners can make as much (or more) money in smaller cities as they can in larger ones. That’s why the N.F.L. does just fine despite not fielding a team in 21 of the country’s top 50 markets — including such enormous metropolitan areas as San Antonio, Las Vegas, Orlando and (of course) Los Angeles. Nor does the N.F.L., which now has 32 teams, have much incentive to expand. On the contrary: expansion dilutes the TV money. (Greg Aiello, the N.F.L.’s spokesman, told me that “expansion isn’t on the table right now.”) Joe Nocera is a business columnist for The New York Times.

Sports - Baseball - MLB: Twins rout ChiSox Mon, May 28, 2007 QUOTE OF THE DAY Eligible Canadians for the MLB Draft: Minnesota Twins' Jason Bartlett is hit by a pitch from Chicago White Sox starting pitcher Jose Contreras during the second inning of a baseball game, Monday, May 28, 2007, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Paul Battaglia) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The Minnesota Twins don't need any extra motivation when they play the Chicago White Sox. But if someone like A.J. Pierzynski wants to provide a little extra push, they'll take it. The Twins rallied after manager Ron Gardenhire hollered at all four umpires when Pierzynski appeared to spike first baseman Justin Morneau, turning a one-run deficit into a 10-4 win on Monday. "I guess (A.J.) woke up a sleeping dog, and you don't want to do that," Twins centre fielder Torii Hunter said. "But, A.J., I don't think he meant anything by it." Nick Punto, Hunter and Jason Tyner each had three hits and Mike Redmond drove in three runs for Minnesota. The game's intensity level rose after Pierzynski, a former Twin, possibly spiked Morneau, a native of New Westminster, B.C., while running out a double play to end the White Sox half of the sixth inning. Gardenhire stormed out of the dugout before the White Sox took the field and yelled at the umpires for about a minute. The manager said after the game that he was upset at first-base umpire John Gibson for telling the Twins' dugout to stop talking to Pierzynski. According to Gardenhire, Gibson looked in the Twins' dugout and made a motion across his throat to try and quiet the team down. Gardenhire did not appreciate the gesture. Gardenhire spoke with Pierzynski after the game and cleared up any misunderstanding. "I met with A.J. and it's over with," he said. "He explained it to me and that's good enough for me." Pierzynski was asked after the game if his reputation had anything to do with the incident. "Doesn't it always?" he said. "It's part of it. I just don't want it to turn into a big thing. I don't want it to fester. That's why I went to Gardy right away and tried to clear the air. I would never try to do anything like that. We don't want to make these guys mad. Every time we do, they score 10 runs." Either way, the incident appeared to fire up the Twins, who scored five times in its half of the sixth to take an 8-4 lead. The Twins tied it on a Punto infield single and took the lead when Hunter chopped one off the plate to for another run-scoring infield single. "You got to do what you got to do," Hunter said. "High choppers are part of the game." Redmond followed with a bases-clearing three-RBI double off Chicago reliever David Aardsma. Twins ace Johan Santana uncharacteristically coughed up an early 3-0 lead by surrendering home runs to Luis Terrero and Paul Konerko in the third and fourth innings, respectively. Chicago took a 4-3 lead on Konerko's two-RBI single in the sixth. "Four runs against (Santana) is like scoring 20 runs against anybody else," White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen said. "But we pitched real poorly today." Santana (6-4) zeroed in after the sixth. He pitched eight innings, allowing four runs and seven hits. The reigning Cy Young winner struck out seven. A highlight-reel catch from Hunter in centre field helped, too. Hunter climbed the wall in right-centre field to rob Jim Thome of a home run in the eighth, bringing the 27,090 in the Metrodome to their feet. The Twins got to White Sox starter Jose Contreras when he is most vulnerable - the early innings. The Twins scored three times in the second inning on singles from Tyner, Punto and Michael Cuddyer. Contreras (4-5) has allowed 21 of his 34 runs this season in the first two innings. He gave up seven runs over 5 1-3 innings, allowing 10 hits. "From the beginning, Jose was really struggling to find the plate," Guillen said. "And the bullpen, they've been doing bad lately. They didn't throw the ball good." Minnesota added two more in the eighth inning, one on a throwing error by Pierzynski., who overthrew third base with Hunter stealing. The play prompted many in the Metrodome to begin a mock chant of "A.J., A.J." After the game, Morneau, downplayed the incident between him and Pierzynski. Morneau came to the plate in the bottom of the sixth, and Larry Vanover stepped in front of Pierzynski to keep things cool. "He clipped my foot a little bit, whatever," said Morneau. "He talked to me when I went up to the plate and he said he didn't know he did it. It's done." Notes: Darin Erstad extended his hitting streak to 12 and Jermaine Dye to 14 with first-inning singles. ... Santana has pitched at least five innings in 102 straight starts. ... The White Sox entered Monday's game last in the AL in batting average (.236), runs scored (188), on-base percentage (.312) and slugging percentage (.376). ... Morneau went 0-for-5 and snapped his 10-game hitting streak. What should Bud Selig do when Bonds breaks the record?

NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, speaking before the start of the Stanley Cup Finals here Monday, said there is no mandate to make any changes but officials want to study the trend and the reasons behind the drop in goals. "Scoring during the regular season was off about three-tenths of a goal a game and the scoring in the playoffs is off about a goal a game," he said. "We're going to look at it with the competition committee. We're going to look at it with the [general] managers and ultimately with the Board [of Governors]," Bettman said. "The first judgment that will have to be made is, is that a significant issue and is that something we need to address?" he said. "Even-strength goals are actually up. There are less penalties, not because we're relaxing the standard, but because everybody's adjusting to it. So the number of power-play goals is where the falloff was in scoring," Bettman said. Bettman also said that the league might look more favorably upon a bid to move a team to Canada by Jim Balsillie, who has signed a letter of intent to buy the Nashville Predators after a bid to buy the Pittsburgh Penguins was rejected. Bettman stressed that no move is in the planning stages and Balsillie has told him that there are no plans to shift the team to Canada, as he had hinted might happen with the Penguins. But Bettman also said he is intrigued by the idea of having another team in hockey-mad Canada. "That's something that, while we haven't studied it, seems to be more likely than it was three, four, five years ago," Bettman said. "If the right circumstances presented themselves and there was an interest in a real meaningful, material way, it's something we would have to obviously look at seriously. But beyond that, we haven't gone to the next step," he said. Bettman did note that the Predators, who have struggled to draw fans despite a strong season on the ice, have a 14-year lease but said that an escape clause could see the team free to leave much sooner. Bettman also addressed the controversy around former Phoenix Coyotes associate coach Rick Tocchet, who on Friday pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to promote gambling and promoting gambling. "Rick Tocchet pled guilty to a Grade 3 felony. He has yet to be sentenced," Bettman said. "I'm not really in a position to say what's going to happen until there's a complete disposition of his case.

http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/n/a/2007/05/30/sports/s152343D82.DTL&cid Twins' Rally Leaves Guillen Envious Twins' Rally Leaves Guillen Envious By DAVE CAMPBELL, AP Sports Writer Wednesday, May 30, 2007 (05-30) 15:23 PDT MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Twins pieced together another small-ball comeback, leaving Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen a little jealous &#8212; and mostly furious. Torii Hunter's four-pitch, bases-loaded walk forced in the winning run with two outs in the ninth inning and sent the surging Twins past the struggling White Sox 7-6 on Wednesday for a three-game sweep. About 19 months after Chicago's World Series title, Guillen was so frustrated by another flat performance that during his latest rant he almost sounded resigned to losing his job. "I'm going to get fired? Good. Is this team going to get better having me out of there? I'd be too happy with it. But as long as I'm here, we've got to play better. As long as I'm here, we have to play better," Guillen said after the fourth straight loss by the White Sox (24-24). Minnesota moved past Chicago into third place in the AL Central, rallying from a 6-1 deficit after 2 1/2 innings against Jon Garland. After beating the White Sox by a combined 19-6 the first two nights, the Twins won for the ninth time in 12 games thanks to a bunch of walks and bouncers &#8212; plus excellent defense and plain old good luck. "They compete as a team. They get you as a team, and that's why they win," said Guillen, who alternated between blaming himself and criticizing his players throughout his postgame remarks. Guillen has long been impressed by the Twins, who sped by the slumping White Sox last summer on the way to their fourth division title in the last five years. But he pinned most of the afternoon's performance on the visiting team. "Offense, defense, pitching, manager, coaches, we all stink," Guillen said. Facing Mike MacDougal (1-2) in the ninth, Jason Tyner drew a one-out walk and moved to second when Nick Punto hit a chopper to Paul Konerko for a possible double play. Konerko's throw grazed Tyner before hitting shortstop Alex Cintron in the right knee for an error on the first baseman. "It was just a bad throw, not really a fluke," Konerko said. "I've made that play a million times." Cintron fielded Michael Cuddyer's grounder deep in the hole, but his throw to second was not in time to force Punto. Boone Logan retired Justin Morneau, but David Aardsma was summoned to face Hunter and walked the free-swinging slugger on four pitches to end the game. "I thought it was pathetic," Aardsma said. Hunter, who finished with three RBIs and leads the team with 45, wanted to swing the bat, of course. He lobbied for the green light when the count went to 3-0. "I saw the ump say, 'You need to come touch first base,' and I was like, `Oh, OK,'" Hunter said. "I didn't know what to do. It was weird, man. That was something totally different. But I like it. We won." Chicago gave up 47 hits over the previous three games. While Garland allowed just five in six innings, the right-hander walked five and struck out only two. He took that 6-1 lead into the bottom of the third and walked the leadoff batter, Jason Bartlett. Punto and Cuddyer walked, too, loading the bases with one out and bringing a frustrated pitching coach, Don Cooper, out of the dugout. Morneau hit a sacrifice fly, and Hunter followed with a two-run double on the first pitch he saw to cut the lead to two. In the sixth, Garland gave up an RBI groundout to Jeff Cirillo and an run-scoring single to Chris Heintz that tied the game at 6. Heintz's hit took Scott Baker off the hook. After a stellar debut for Minnesota 11 days earlier when he replaced Sidney Ponson in the rotation, Baker has regressed in his last two starts. Some of his breaking balls missed the plate by a few feet and he gave up six runs and 10 hits in only three innings &#8212; including Rob Mackowiak's two-run homer. Manager Ron Gardenhire, however, was most disappointed by Baker's failure to cover first base when Morneau made a diving stop of Cintron's grounder in the second. "Those are things that you can't get away with at this level when you're trying to win ballgames," Gardenhire said. The Twins got away with it, though, by doing just about everything else right. Jason Miller, Matt Guerrier, Pat Neshek and Joe Nathan (2-1) teamed up to throw six hitless innings in relief, and Jason Kubel's jumping catch against the left-field wall to take a homer away from Tadahito Iguchi in the top of the ninth highlighted a series of standout defensive plays in the late innings. "Guys start getting confident, and that's what happens," Gardenhire said. Notes:@ Of Minnesota's 26 runs in this series, 18 came with two outs. ... This was the final game as Minnesota's official scorer for Tom Mee, the first employee hired by the organization when the franchise moved from Washington before the 1961 season. Mee worked in public relations and became official scorer in 1991. Get up to 50% off home delivery of the Chronicle for 12 weeks!

That is an exaggeration, of course, but it seemed inevitable on Wednesday. Skip to next paragraph Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press, via Associated Press Umpire Chad Fairchild separating Alex Rodriguez and Blue Jays shortstop John McDonald after an infield pop fell untouched in the ninth inning. Keep up with the latest news on the on The Times’s baseball blog. Go to the Bats Blog » Times Topics: The Yankees Times Topics: The Mets Johnny Damon hit a leadoff homer in the first against Jesse Litsch as the Yankees took an early 5-0 lead. Rodriguez’s day at the ballpark began with a refusal to answer questions about his personal life, which had been splashed on the front of The New York Post. It ended with the assertion that has dogged him for four years in pinstripes: that he does not handle himself as a Yankee should. by two runs in an eventual 10-5 victory when lifted a lazy fly ball to third base with two outs in the top of the ninth inning. Third baseman Howie Clark camped under it, but he backed off just after Rodriguez ran slowly past him. Rodriguez said he shouted “Ha” as he passed Clark, who was fooled into thinking that the shortstop, John McDonald, had called for the ball. When Clark backed away, the ball dropped safely onto the turf for a run-scoring single. The Blue Jays were incensed, with umpires restraining McDonald from charging at Rodriguez. John Gibbons, the Blue Jays’ manager, had words with Rodriguez, who smiled as he stood on third base. singled in two more runs to make it a rout. “I haven’t been in the game that long,” said Gibbons, who was playing in the majors when Rodriguez was 8 years old. “Maybe I’m naïve. But, to me, it’s bush league. One thing, to everybody in this business, you always look at the Yankees and they do things right. They play hard, class operation, that’s what the Yanks are known for. That’s not Yankee baseball.” Rodriguez said he hears opposing players shouting at him on foul balls near the dugout three or four times a week. He did not admit to intentionally distracting Clark — “I don’t know what my intention was,” he said — but he pointed out that the Blue Jays had made a heady play in stealing home on Tuesday. Rodriguez said he was simply trying to win. “We’re desperate,” he said. “We haven’t won a game in a little bit now. We won the game.” It was the Yankees’ first victory in a week, and it snapped a five-game losing streak. They remain tied for last place, and they will enter this weekend’s series at Boston trailing the by 13 ½ games in the American League East. “This lifted a real cloud off us, especially with the off day tomorrow,” Manager said. “To have to carry that through the off day and into Boston would have been difficult. Hopefully, with the way we have our pitching lined up, we can start competing and have some good results.” Robinson Canó went 4 for 4 with three doubles Wednesday, and converted on his first save opportunity since May 3. Tyler Clippard wobbled through five innings for the victory, walking five and throwing 98 pitches, and Torre did not commit to leaving him in the rotation. “We know he’s probably not quite ready,” Torre said, “but he doesn’t stop competing. He works at it out there. He doesn’t stop coming at you, which is pretty impressive for a kid who’s 22 years old.” Clippard allowed three runs but made the Yankees’ first-inning outburst stand up. Johnny Damon led off with a homer, later adding a single for his 2,000th career hit. The Yankees chased the rookie Jesse Litsch, who got just two outs and allowed five runs in the first inning. It was 6-5 when Rivera bailed out an erratic Kyle Farnsworth with two outs and two on in the eighth. Lyle Overbay shattered his bat on a grounder to first to end that inning, and the Blue Jays went down in order in the ninth. Of his cutter, Rivera said, “It was moving, yes it was.” Rodriguez singled in the ninth to make it 7-5, and his verbal interference with Clark allowed the Yankees to pile on. The third base coach, Larry Bowa, said that Rodriguez did not cross a line of good sportsmanship. “If you say, ‘I got it,’ I think that’s very unacceptable,” Bowa said. “He didn’t say, ‘I got it.’ He said, ‘Hey, hey.’ They parted like the Red Sea.” Gibbons said he told Rodriguez he thought it was a bush league play, which Bowa also heard. But Rodriguez claimed not to hear anything that Gibbons or McDonald said, and not to care, either. “I could care less,” Rodriguez said. “They have their opinions. We’re looking not to get swept. It really didn’t make a difference. Mo shut them down in the ninth.” In a season that seems to get weirder every day, that, at least, was a comforting feeling for the Yankees. A second magnetic resonance imaging exam on Phil Hughes’s left ankle revealed a Grade III sprain, indicating a torn ligament. Hughes will not be allowed to throw off a mound for about six more weeks, though General Manager said the Yankees have ruled out surgery. “He can walk on it, and it doesn’t look all that bad,” Cashman said. “But it is what it is. They’ve got him in a boot. He’s been throwing with a boot on it. But it’s going to push him back, because he’s not going to be able to throw off a mound.” Cashman said Hughes’s hamstring was almost fully healed when he injured the ankle doing conditioning drills last Friday. Hughes’s timetable would make it unlikely that he could return before August. ... Joe Torre exchanged e-mail messages with , and Clemens told Torre he was looking forward to starting against the on Monday in Chicago. ... Kyle Farnsworth has just two 1-2-3 innings in 22 games this season. Next Article in Sports (2 of 26) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Young dominated the Pirates again, allowing four hits over seven innings in the San Diego Padres' 9-0 victory Wednesday night. A former Pirates farmhand, Young walked one and struck out seven. Pittsburgh has managed seven hits in 23 2-3 career innings against Young (6-3). "I think certain guys match up better against certain teams, and he obviously matches up well against us," said Jason Bay, who had one of only two extra-base hits against Young. "The three times he's thrown, obviously, we don't have a lot of him figured out yet." Mike Cameron had three hits and three RBIs and Khalil Greene's grand slam in the eighth inning gave San Diego a 7-0 lead. The Padres have won four of five and seven of nine. "It was a good win for us," Young said. "I felt good. For the most part, I was able to execute my pitches pretty well. I had decent fastball command and for me that's my bread and butter. On nights when I'm able to put my fastball where I want, I'll take my chances." Chris Duffy had two hits for the Pirates, who had won four of five. In his two previous starts against Pittsburgh &#8212; both last season &#8212; Young took a no-hitter into the sixth inning. His no-hit bid June 4 at PNC Park lasted 5 1-3 innings and he allowed two hits in eight shutout innings. On Sept. 22, in San Diego, Young lost a no-hitter with one out in the ninth on Joe Randa's two-run homer. Still, Young downplayed his supremacy over Pittsburgh. "You've got to get up for every game," Young said. "It's the big leagues and if you don't have your good stuff, teams are going to make you pay. Regardless of who it is, I just try to focus on making good pitches and try to execute my game plan. Some nights it works out and other nights it doesn't." Pittsburgh had 11 players on the roster who had faced Young before Wednesday, and they were a combined 3-for-49 (.061) against him. The Pirates went 4-for-24 against him Wednesday. "We've not been able to do much at all with him," Pirates manager Jim Tracy said. "There is deception to him, obviously, and there's something that we're not seeing." The best chance Pittsburgh had to score was in the sixth, when Paul Maholm singled with one out and Jose Bautista followed with a double. But Young got Chris Duffy to foul out down the third base line and Freddy Sanchez to fly out to center. "I don't think it's ever easy," Padres manager Bud Black said. "It just isn't. It might seem that way at times but it's not." The Padres took a 1-0 lead in the third after consecutive singles by Greene and Paul McAnulty off Maholm were followed by a sacrifice by Young and an RBI groundout by Marcus Giles. Young came up with runners on second and third and one out in the fifth. A pitch after fouling off an attempted bunt on a squeeze play, Young lined a single up the middle to score Kevin Kouzmanoff and make it 2-0. "I'm pleased with how I threw," Maholm said. "But losing, there's no consolation in saying, 'Hey I threw a good game but we lost.'" Cameron's two-out single in the eighth scored Giles and ended Maholm's night. Jonah Bayliss entered the game and walked two batters before Greene's shot to straightaway center. It was the second grand slam of the shortstop's career &#8212; the other on Sept. 17, 2005, against Washington &#8212; and second of the season for the Padres. Cameron added a two-run double in the ninth. "We're not the swiftest team or the most powerful team," Cameron said. "But we've got guys who can put a good swing on the baseball." Maholm (2-7) was charged with four runs and six hits in 7 2-3 innings with five strikeouts and two walks. The Pirates have won only three of his 11 starts this season. "He did a great job tonight, he really did," Tracy said. "He takes you into the eighth inning of a 2-0 ballgame that a starter is on the other side of the field that we've had fits with. But we were very much in the baseball game. He deserved a better fate than he got." Notes:@ Pirates OF Xavier Nady was given the night off despite hitting .391 with three home runs and 13 RBIs in his past 11 games. ... The Pirates have never won a series from the Padres at PNC Park. ... With one game remaining in the month, San Diego has allowed 65 runs over 26 games.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) BOSTON - Even the most selective team in the league couldn't coax a walk out of Paul Byrd. Putting his pitches where he wanted, Byrd extended his walkless streak to 43 innings and threw first-pitch strikes to 25 of 27 hitters as the Cleveland Indians beat the Boston Red Sox 8-4 Wednesday night. "I don't know that I take pride in a walk streak. I take a lot of pride in making them earn their way to first base," he said. The loss snapped a five-game winning streak for Boston (36-16), which has the best record in the majors. Cleveland (32-19), with the AL's second best record, overcame a 2-0 deficit after four innings and avoided being swept in the three-game series. Byrd (6-1), who won his fifth straight decision, issued his last walk more than a month ago , to Kenny Lofton of Texas on April 26 , and has gone six games without throwing four balls on any at batter. The only Cleveland pitcher in the last 50 years with a longer streak than 43 innings is Dick Donovan, who went 45 1-3 in 1963. In 58 innings this year, Byrd has walked just three. Stopping the Red Sox from walking is impressive, considering they lead the league with 221. Cleveland catcher Kelly Shoppach said Byrd's ability to throw pitches close to the plate, but not down the middle, entices opponents to swing. "They may not get the pitches they want to hit. That's why they take them," Shoppach said. "As a pitcher and catcher, we want to attack them. We want them to swing the bat." Shoppach was the most productive swinger with a career-high four hits, including a solo homer in the eighth. The former Boston farmhand led Cleveland's season-high 18-hit attack. Daisuke Matsuzaka (7-3) allowed 12 in 5 2-3 innings. "Not only my fastball, but, overall, I think I had problems with my control," he said. Matsuzaka didn't walk anyone but left more pitches over the plate than Byrd. And he didn't get his usual support. In his previous 10 starts, the Red Sox scored 63 runs for him. But they hadn't faced Byrd yet. "We knew coming in he is not going to walk anybody," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "You have to hit him to beat him." Trailing 2-0, Byrd shut down Boston until Cleveland tied the game in the fifth and went ahead 6-2 in the sixth. "He's aggressive," Shoppach said. "If they're not knocking him all over the place, they're not giving us a reason to change our game plan." Matsuzaka had won his previous six decisions but was driven from the game in the sixth when he allowed four runs despite getting help from a poor call by second base umpire Rick Reed. Former Boston right fielder Trot Nixon led off with a double and scored the tie-breaking run on David Dellucci's double. Josh Barfield singled to left, scoring Dellucci. Shoppach then singled Barfield to second. But Barfield rounded the base and was called out trying to get back when left fielder Manny Ramirez threw behind him to Dustin Pedroia, who swiped at the runner. Barfield and manager Eric Wedge argued and replays showed Pedroia missed Barfield by a wide margin. Two pitches later, Grady Sizemore hit his ninth homer, giving Cleveland a 6-2 lead and bringing Kyle Snyder in for Matsuzaka. "I don't know if he struggled as much as they hit him," Boston catcher Jason Varitek said. "They were able to get one pitch each at-bat." Kevin Youkilis extended his hitting streak to a career-best 22 games, but his stretch of multihit games ended at nine. He made a costly out in the seventh when the Red Sox loaded the bases with no outs on three singles that knocked Byrd out of the game. Youkilis struck out for the second out before David Ortiz lined the ball just foul past the right field pole then was retired on a soft liner. Mike Lowell added a two-run homer, his 10th, in the eighth. Boston had taken a 2-0 lead on RBI grounders by Varitek in the second and J.D. Drew in the fourth. Cleveland tied it in the fifth on a single by Shoppach, a double by Sizemore, a run-scoring groundout by Casey Blake and an RBI double by Travis Hafner. Notes:@ Ramirez turned 35 years old on Wednesday. ... Cleveland starters have walked fewer than three batters in the last 16 games ... Lowell extended his home hitting streak to 22 games. ... Blake and Pedroia extended their hitting streaks to 10 games.

The only Cleveland pitcher in the last 50 years with a longer streak than 43 innings is Dick Donovan, who went 45 1-3 in 1963. In 58 innings this year, Byrd has walked just three. Stopping the Red Sox from walking is impressive, considering they lead the league with 221. Cleveland catcher Kelly Shoppach said Byrd's ability to throw pitches close to the plate, but not down the middle, entices opponents to swing. "They may not get the pitches they want to hit. That's why they take them," Shoppach said. "As a pitcher and catcher, we want to attack them. We want them to swing the bat." Shoppach was the most productive swinger with a career-high four hits, including a solo homer in the eighth. The former Boston farmhand led Cleveland's season-high 18-hit attack. Daisuke Matsuzaka (7-3) allowed 12 in 5 2-3 innings. "Not only my fastball, but, overall, I think I had problems with my control," he said. Matsuzaka didn't walk anyone but left more pitches over the plate than Byrd. And he didn't get his usual support. In his previous 10 starts, the Red Sox scored 63 runs for him. But they hadn't faced Byrd yet. "We knew coming in he is not going to walk anybody," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "You have to hit him to beat him." Trailing 2-0, Byrd shut down Boston until Cleveland tied the game in the fifth and went ahead 6-2 in the sixth. "He's aggressive," Shoppach said. "If they're not knocking him all over the place, they're not giving us a reason to change our game plan." Matsuzaka had won his previous six decisions but was driven from the game in the sixth when he allowed four runs despite getting help from a poor call by second base umpire Rick Reed. Former Boston right fielder Trot Nixon led off with a double and scored the tie-breaking run on David Dellucci's double. Josh Barfield singled to left, scoring Dellucci. Shoppach then singled Barfield to second. But Barfield rounded the base and was called out trying to get back when left fielder Manny Ramirez threw behind him to Dustin Pedroia, who swiped at the runner. Barfield and manager Eric Wedge argued and replays showed Pedroia missed Barfield by a wide margin. Two pitches later, Grady Sizemore hit his ninth homer, giving Cleveland a 6-2 lead and bringing Kyle Snyder in for Matsuzaka. "I don't know if he struggled as much as they hit him," Boston catcher Jason Varitek said. "They were able to get one pitch each at-bat." Kevin Youkilis extended his hitting streak to a career-best 22 games, but his stretch of multihit games ended at nine. He made a costly out in the seventh when the Red Sox loaded the bases with no outs on three singles that knocked Byrd out of the game. Youkilis struck out for the second out before David Ortiz lined the ball just foul past the right field pole then was retired on a soft liner. Mike Lowell added a two-run homer, his 10th, in the eighth. Boston had taken a 2-0 lead on RBI grounders by Varitek in the second and J.D. Drew in the fourth. Cleveland tied it in the fifth on a single by Shoppach, a double by Sizemore, a run-scoring groundout by Casey Blake and an RBI double by Travis Hafner.

http://www.twincities.com/sports/ci_6024127&cid TwinCities.com - Walk puts finishing touch on the Twins' 6-run rally Working Q & A Walk puts finishing touch on the Twins' 6-run rally White Sox worn out in three-game sweep Article Last Updated: 05/31/2007 12:01:40 AM CDT A happy Torii Hunter, center, is mobbed by teammates after walking on four pitches with the bases loaded in the ninth inning to send the winning run home as the Twins beat the White Sox 7-6 Wednesday. (JOHN DOMAN, Pioneer Press) Torii Hunter didn't know what to do. He had just drawn a walk-off walk, something new for the normally swing-hungry hitter. He started toward first base, turned back toward home and wondered about the protocol. "I didn't know whether to cheer or go down the first-base line," Hunter said after the Twins' 7-6 victory over the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday at the Metrodome. "I saw the ump looking at me like, 'You need to come touch first base.' " Winning with a walk is the latest way the Twins' suddenly stout offense has found to start climbing the ranks in the American League Central. In a three-game sweep of the divisional rival White Sox, the Twins hit home runs and doubles, sacrifice flies and bunts. They drew walks, worked counts and twice won with comebacks. This is not the team that decided buzz cuts were the remedy for its struggles, but this is a still a team with buzz cuts. Earlier this week, Boof Bonser said he would like to grow his hair a bit longer. Now his team has won four straight series, and Bonser doubts his locks will be lengthened any time soon. During the Twins' six-game homestand, they scored 42 runs on 69 hits. Hunter knocked in his 45th run, second in the AL. Justin Morneau improved his home run total to 16 and is only three behind Alex Rodriguez's league-leading 19. "It comes with confidence," Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. "Guys start getting confident, and that's what happens. We talk about it all the time. We talk about working the counts, but it comes obviously with a confident group." Wednesday, starter Scott Baker left his team in a 6-1 hole heading into the bottom of the third inning, but those once-overwhelming deficits no longer seem so menacing. Minnesota climbed back with single after single - only one of the team's seven hits was for extra bases (Hunter's two-run double in the third) - and the bullpen was flawless, holding Chicago hitless in six innings. "That was straight Piranha right there," said Hunter, who went 2 for 4 with three runs batted in and is batting .318 for the season. The Twins' sweep put them one game ahead of Chicago in the AL Central and boosted their home record to 15-14 and their overall mark to 27-25. For Michael Cuddyer, it seems like another year but the same story. "It seemed like at the same point last year, when we went into Milwaukee and won that series, we just took off after that," Cuddyer said. "I don't know if it was the atmosphere in Milwaukee that kind of rejuvenated us, but it seemed to have done it again this year. We're starting to play better baseball now, and hopefully we can sustain. "We have the same type of mentality that we had last year where we feel like we can win every game no matter if we're up, no matter if we're down, no matter what inning it is, we feel like we have a chance to win every game. It's a great feeling. I'm glad we finally got that feeling back because to be honest with you, we didn't have it two weeks ago." Before starting the series-winning streak in Milwaukee, the Twins had won only one of their previous nine series. Now 9-3 since being swept by Cleveland, they travel to the West Coast for six games before a normally successful time of the season begins - interleague play. After playing 12 games against divisional opponents in May, the Twins won't see an AL Central team again until June 29. Last season, they dominated the National League, going 16-2 in the midst of their turnaround. Things could be different this season. The Twins take on the Brewers and New York Mets, two of the best teams in the NL, along with perennially tough Atlanta and a young, scrappy Florida club. No matter the opponent, Gardenhire said his team would continue to focus on winning each series. "Right now, we have a confident offensive team that can make some things happen," he said, "slap the ball around, take good at-bats and come up with some big hits, and we're doing those things. You just have to continue that process." Kelsie Smith can be reached at ksmith@pioneerpress.com. The Pioneer Press is pleased to let readers post comments about an article at the end of the article.

But those days are long gone now. Harang became the Reds' first six-game winner by going the distance in a 4-3 victory over Houston on Wednesday. It was Cincinnati's third straight win. Harang is 6-0 over his last seven starts against Houston, which has lost 10 straight games. "A couple of years ago, I couldn't get a ball by them," said Harang, who tossed his first complete game of the season. "I remember that well." In 2004-05, Harang started nine games against Houston and was 1-5. But the last two seasons, he's unbeaten against the Astros. "I don't know what it is," Harang said. "I don't know if I'm throwing different or not. "I just go out and try to be aggressive. It doesn't matter who I'm facing. I just try to throw strikes and make them put the ball in play." Harang allowed two earned runs on six hits while striking out seven. He retired 14 straight after allowing a second-inning single to Adam Everett. "Harang was outstanding," said Reds manager Jerry Narron, who was ejected in the first inning for arguing balls and strikes. "He has given us good outings almost every time out this year. With your No. 1 guy, that's what you're looking for. It was nice to see us play some good defense behind him too." Harang (6-2) was getting his slider past the Astros all night. "That's what [pitching coach] Dick Pole said, that my slider was real tight," Harang said. "I was able to throw it down in the zone. "I went [to bench coach] Bucky [Dent] after the seventh and told him I could finish it. I figured I have an extra day off this week, so I could run the pitch count up a little [to 105]. And they were swinging early a lot." Harang impressed his teammates. "He did a phenomenal job," center fielder Norris Hopper said. "He was just doing his thing, and they couldn't get to him." The Reds jumped to a 3-0 lead in the first inning, although they lost Narron in the process. Narron saw six pitches before being thrown out by home-plate umpire Bill Welke. Hopper, who went 3-for-4, led off the game with a double and scored on Alex Gonzalez's single. An RBI double by Ken Griffey Jr. drove in Gonzalez. Griffey scored on Adam Dunn's single. It was Dunn's 500th career RBI. Hopper has gone 6-for-8 since taking over the leadoff spot Tuesday from the injured Ryan Freel. "He just puts the bat on the ball," Narron said of Hopper. "It's great to see somebody step in and do the job for us like that. I'm happy for the guy. He has put in a lot of time in the Minor Leagues to get here." Said Hopper: "I feel real good, but it's only a couple of games. I've been waiting on this chance all year to show what I can do. Any time you get an opportunity, you have to give it your best shot. It's easy leading off when you have guys like Gonzalez and Griffey and Dunn behind you. I just have to get on base and let them knock me in." The Reds have matched their longest winning streak of the year, having last won three straight during the first week of the season (April 5-7). "That's the way we should be playing," Gonzalez said. "We know we are better than we've been playing. When you're struggling, you're struggling, and you just have to forget about it. But we've got a good team, and I think we're coming out of that [slump] now." "You can just tell the atmosphere is way different in the locker room," Hopper said. "Everybody's working hard and working together, and that's all you can ask for." is a contributor to MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.

Click me to Bettman intrigued about new Canadian team NHL commissioner, Gary Bettman speaks during a press conference before the start of Game One of the 2007 Stanley Cup finals between the Anaheim Ducks and the Ottawa Senators on May 28, 2007 at Honda Center in Anaheim, California. Photograph by : Jeff Golden/Getty Images Ken Warren, CanWest News Service Published: Tuesday, May 29, 2007 ANAHEIM, Calif. -- National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman called the prospect of adding another Canadian team "intriguing" on Monday. During his state-of-the-league address before Game 1 of the Stanley Cup final, Bettman addressed issues from weak TV ratings to a drop in NHL coverage from traditional media outlets, but his most interesting comments dealt with Jim Balsillie's tentative agreement to purchase the Nashville Predators from Craig Leopold for $220 million US. Balsillie, owner of Waterloo, Ont.-based Research in Motion, maker of the Blackberry electronic communication device, has made no secret of his desire to move an NHL team to Ontario. Earlier this season, Balsillie offered $175 million US for the Pittsburgh Penguins, but later withdrew that offer. While Bettman danced around the particulars of the pending sale, the terms of the lease between the Predators and the city of Nashville would allow an owner to move the franchise next year if the team's paid attendance doesn't top 14,000 during the 2007-'08 season. The Predators averaged 13,815 fans this season. Bettman deflected questions on whether the league's board of governors would allow a relocation of the franchise - such a move would require approval from 75 per cent of the league's governors - and the possibility that Balsillie would try to put the club in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ont. What Bettman did open up about was the potential for the NHL to return to either Winnipeg or Quebec City. The Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix in 1996, becoming the Coyotes, one year after the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver and became the Colorado Avalanche. "When we had the chance to go back to Minnesota, we did because it made sense, the right ownership, the right building situation," Bettman said. "The market was strong and vibrant. We haven't studied Quebec City or Winnipeg or anywhere else in Canada, but the notion that, if it could work to put a franchise back in a place where it was once lost, feels good. It intrigues me, it's intriguing." Bettman tempered his remarks by pointing out the league wouldn't return to any market unless its officials were satisfied all conditions were in place to ensure success. Winnipeg has only a 15,000-seat arena for the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League, and that is generally considered too small to house an NHL team, in part because the arena couldn't generate enough revenue to sustain a big-league franchise. The Nordiques left Quebec City because they couldn't find an owner willing to build a new arena to replace the aging Colisee.

Not Zito, as Giants Blank Mets - New York Times Giants 3, Mets 0 Overrated? Not Zito, as Giants Blank Mets Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 31, 2007 The guy named Barry stepped into the batter’s box last night, and the booing started almost immediately. The chants came a few seconds later. “Overrated! Overrated!” the crowd screamed. Skip to next paragraph Barton Silverman/The New York Times Barry Zito improved to 5-5. He went seven innings and gave up six hits, a walk, struck out seven and lowered his E.R.A. to 4.21. Keep up with the latest news on the on The Times’s baseball blog. Go to the Bats Blog » Times Topics: The Yankees Times Topics: The Mets Barton Silverman/The New York Times Rich Aurilia was forced out on a ball hit by Barry Bonds in the third. David Wright, who had shifted near second, completed the double play. Sitting on the bench, might have chuckled. However briefly, the fans’ disdain rerouted toward one of his teammates. Barry Zito, the left-hander who spurned the ’ free-agent offer last off-season for $51 million more, a longer contract and the chance to continue living in Northern California, had apparently rankled some folks at Shea Stadium. Then Zito went out and produced a dominant pitching performance — seven scoreless innings in the Giants’ 3-0 victory — which probably bothered them even more. Overrated? Not last night. “Obviously, he was great,” Manager Willie Randolph said after the Mets were shut out for the first time this season. Almost in the next sentence, Randolph said the same thing about his left-handed control specialist, , who remained stuck at 295 career victories. He and Zito shared eerily similar pitching lines: Over seven innings, each threw 122 pitches, 77 for strikes, but the difference came in how they handled runners on base. Zito (5-5) stranded all six base runners, while Glavine, a pitch away from ending the inning each time the Giants scored, allowed them to rally with two outs and no one on base. He allowed two runs in the first and one in the third — Pedro Feliz drove in all three — then, buoyed by an extra day’s rest, stayed in long enough to hope the offense would awaken. It never did. “When their guys are hitting ground balls, I’m doing my job,” said Glavine, who scattered nine hits. “I’m just not getting the results. There’s nothing I can say to make people understand when you go out there, do what you want to do, make the pitches and you don’t get the results. It’s one of the single most frustrating things.” In 12 starts, Glavine has five victories and a 3.44 earned run average. He acknowledged afterward that considering the way he has pitched this season, he might have expected another victory here or there. But, he added, he understands that things have a way of evening out. “Three hundred is so far away right now that it’s not even part of the equation,” Glavine said. Unlike in their last meeting, Glavine kept Bonds in the park, holding him to one hit in four plate appearances. Bonds singled, grounded into a double play, was walked intentionally and grounded out, and his single contributed to the Giants’ two-run first. After falling behind, 1-2, Bengie Molina drew a walk, loading the bases for Feliz, who grounded a two-run single past In all, Glavine needed 30 pitches to set down the Giants, continuing an unsettling trend. He has not pitched a scoreless first inning since May 8, in San Francisco, and he threw more than 29 pitches in the first for the third consecutive start. “More than anything else, it’s a streak of bad luck,” Glavine said. “I’m going to give up runs at some point, they’ve just been coming too soon.” With Zito pitching, any runs were too much. On a glorious 76-degree day, Zito strolled into the Giants’ clubhouse before the game wearing a knit cap and a fleece jacket. The attire had no effect on his mood. Cool, calm and collected as always, Zito won his second start against the Mets this month and, a few players said, looked even better this time around. When he missed, he missed down. He complemented a fastball that did not exceed 87 miles an hour with a slow curve, a slower curve and an even slower curve. Of his seven strikeouts, six came on a curveball, and Mets hitters could not adjust when he jammed them with cutters. “He’s got this late movement,” said , who had one of the Mets’ six hits. The Mets put runners on base in each of the first five innings, including the first two batters in the second, then wasted Paul Lo Duca’s leadoff double (his 1,000th career hit) in the seventh. Zito finished off his evening by striking out pinch-hitter Julio Franco looking at a menacing 66-m.p.h curveball. “It’s always great coming to New York,” said Zito, who, as a member of the , pitched nine times at Yankee Stadium. “You get all these trash-talking fans saying everything they can think of to me in the outfield. That’s what makes this place special.” Asked if heard anything original, Zito said: “Not creative at all. Just blatant expletives at me. That’s all.” Staying true to his pregame promise, Willie Randolph inserted Guillermo Mota, fresh off his 50-game suspension for violating baseball’s policy on performance-enhancing drugs. He received a mixed reaction from the crowd of 41,395, although the fans clapped and welcomed him into the dugout after he pitched an uneventful eighth inning. Mota pitched a perfect ninth, too. “It’s nice to be back,” Mota said. ... On May 17, when Moises Alou was placed on the disabled list with a strained left quadriceps, he vowed to return May 28, the first day he was eligible to come off. That day has come and gone, and Alou said he was frustrated that the injury had taken longer than expected to heal. “I guess what I did was more serious than what we thought,” Alou said. “It’s something that I thought wouldn’t take that long, and I don’t know what set me back.” The earlier projection that Alou could return by the weekend seems a little premature, he said, and a more reasonable guess is that he will be activated toward the middle of next week. Alou was more optimistic about his pending return Sunday in Florida, but he tried running Monday and still felt discomfort.

Tim Duncan and Tony Parker each scored 21 points, helping the Spurs clinch the Western Conference series 4-1 and book a place in the NBA finals for the third time in five seasons. The Spurs will play either the Detroit Pistons or the Cleveland Cavaliers in the finals, which start on June 7 in San Antonio. The Pistons and Cavaliers are tied 2-2 in the Eastern Conference finals. "It's great," told reporters. "Last year we had a tough finish. To come back this year, to put the team back together, to have a healthy year myself and to go through three really, really good teams. It's great to get back here." San Antonio were leading Utah 16-11 in the first period when they embarked on a streak that set the tone for the game. Parker scored seven consecutive points to push the advantage to 23-11 and Duncan dunked on an alley oop. Bruce Bowen connected on a three-pointer before Parker drove for another basket and in less than three minutes the Spurs had a 19-point lead. "Tonight we played great, everybody from the starting five, from the bench, everybody made shots," Parker told reporters. "I think we won that game in the first quarter, and we kept the lead the whole game." The Spurs, who have defeated the Jazz 19 consecutive times in San Antonio, led 34-15 after the first quarter and 55-39 at the half. That advantage grew to 83-56 going into the fourth. Andrei Kirilenko led the Jazz with 13 points. Deron Williams, who played with a sprained left foot, and Matt Harpring had 11 each. Carlos Boozer was held to nine points and 12 rebounds. Guard Derek Fisher missed the first half while returning from New York where is daughter is undergoing treatment for an eye condition. He was 0-3 from the floor. The finals will be the Spurs' fourth appearance in nine seasons. They won the NBA title in 1999, 2003 and 2005, but lost in the second round of the 2004 playoffs and the Western Conference semi-finals in 2006. They have seven days to prepare for another tilt at the title. . All rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Mickelson aims for hat-trick over Woods Golf by Mike Brewer Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods lock horns again in this week&rsquo;s US PGA Tour event, The Memorial, with the former rating an attractive bet at 8-1 with Ladbrokes to confirm his recent superiority over the world No.1 and claim his third win of the season. Mickelson, second to his nemesis in the world order, opened his year&rsquo;s account in the Pebble Beach Pro-Am in February but looked better than ever in just his third event since turning to Butch Harmon, Woods&rsquo; former coach, when claiming a two-shot victory in the Players&rsquo; Championship at Sawgrass this month. Woods was 37th. And, whilst he has not been a regular at Muirfield Village, Mickelson has shown a liking for the 7,366-yard track on each appearance, finishing tied-11th in 1999, tied-ninth in 2002, and tied-fourth to Carl Pettersson last year. Woods, a general 5-2 favourite, can point to a hat-trick of Memorial victories from 1999 to 2001, since when he has had three other top-four finishes before missing the event after the death of his father last year. He has won three of his seven starts this year. Vijay Singh, one shot out of a play-off at Wentworth on Sunday, and Masters champion Zach Johnson, respectively priced at 16-1 and 28-1, are others to consider in a sterling field that featues the top-ten money-winners on the PGA tour. * Town / City Save to my times Yorkshire set to haunt Phantoms Bookies expect Derby to drop straight back The Test Cricket Podcast with Mark Chapman To hell and back Alan Lee on the charismatic trainer aiming to win his first classic at Epsom Epsom trainers hoping for mini-revival on Derby day Your Browser doesn't support Inline frames She relied on an oxygen machine.

(Sports Network) - The St. Louis Cardinals try to string back-to-back wins together on the road for the first time in nearly two months this evening, when they wrap up a four-game set with the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field. St. Louis became the last NL team to reach double digits in road victories on Wednesday, as Albert Pujols and Jim Edmonds homered on two straight pitches to highlight a five-run fifth inning in the Cardinals' 8-4 win. Scott Rolen finished 2-for-5 with two RBI for the Cardinals, who snapped a seven-game road losing streak and improved to just 10-16 away from home this season. Edmonds finished 3-for-5 for St. Louis, which is just 3-11 this month on the road and has not won back-to-back away games since it won four in a row from April 8-11. Todd Wellemeyer (1-1) allowed three runs on seven hits with a walk and three strikeouts over five-plus frames in the first start of his major league career. Brad Hawpe and Matt Holliday homered for the Rockies, who saw their first seven-game win streak since September 6-12, 1998 come to an end. Jason Hirsh (2-5), who is winless in his last seven starts, gave up eight runs on 10 hits with two strikeouts and two walks in 4 2/3 innings for Colorado. Getting the call for the Cardinals tonight will be right-hander Brad Thompson, who has won two of his last three starts. Thompson improved to 3-1 on the year after he surrendered three runs and 10 hits in 5 1/3 innings Saturday against the Washington Nationals. Thompson, who is pitching to a 4.72 earned run average on the year, has yet to receive a decision against the Rockies in five career outings. His only other start against Colorado came back on May 8, when he allowed a run on six hits in five innings of his team's 4-1 win. Colorado will counter with veteran Aaron Cook, who is 4-1 with a 4.11 ERA. Cook won his fourth straight decision Saturday against the San Francisco Giants, giving up a run and five hits in his first complete game of the season. All the news was not great for the Cardinals on Wednesday, as they learned that catcher Yadier Molina will miss four-to-six weeks with a fractured left wrist. Molina, who is hitting .273, left Tuesday's game in the fourth inning after being hit by a foul tip an inning earlier. The Rockies have split their six meetings with the Cards so far this year, though St. Louis won seven of nine against Colorado last season.

The Australian, seeded 14th and one of the dark horses for the title, is known for his fighting spirit and he needed it as he claimed a 4-6 3-6 6-2 6-4 6-2 win in almost three-and-a-half hours on Philippe Chatrier court. Gaudio, the 2004 champion, looked in control when two sets up but Hewitt then launched an all-too-familiar fightback and forced the Argentinian into a raft of errors. After seeing himself pegged back level at two sets all, Gaudio trudged back to his seat as he was broken again in the opening game of the decider. Hewitt, who has not gone further than the quarter-finals at the French Open, had no further problems and set up a third-round clash with Jarkko Nieminen. The Finn, seeded 20th, thrashed France's Mathieu Montcourt 6-1 6-1 6-4 on Court 3. Marcos Baghdatis found it just as straightforward as he raced through his second-round clash. The Cypriot defeated Denmark's Kristian Pless 7-5 6-3 6-4 on Court 1 to reach the third round at Roland Garros for the first time in three attempts. He will now face Jan Hajek, who beat fellow Czech Bohdan Ulihrach in five sets. Baghdatis, seeded 16th, made his name in the tennis world by reaching the final of the Australian Open last year, before losing to Roger Federer. Meanwhile, Serbia's Novak Djokovic, the sixth seed, secured a four-set victory over Frenchman Laurent Recouderc. The 20-year-old Djokovic, a quarter-finalist at Roland Garros last year, won 6-3 3-6 6-3 6-1 on Suzanne Lenglen court.

DUCKS 1, SENATORS 0 High-flying Ducks take 2-0 lead Anaheim's Corey Perry needs some ice after he's dropped by Mike Fisher (center). (MARK J. TERRILL/ASSOCIATED PRESS) By Fluto Shinzawa, Globe Staff | ANAHEIM, Calif. -- It can be no comfort to the Ottawa Senators, now down, 2-0, in the Stanley Cup finals, that the Anaheim Ducks have turned the rink into a minefield. Last night at the Honda Center, everywhere the Senators seemed to skate, they plowed into booby traps and barbed wire set by the mischievous Ducks and general Randy Carlyle, whose tactics have given his club a two-game advantage in the best-of-seven series. "The biggest thing for us is that we're getting really good back pressure," said Anaheim checking-line wing Rob Niedermayer. "We're not giving them too many odd-man rushes. That lets our D stand up and not give them the line too much. If you give them the blue line, they're going to make pretty skilled plays out there. That's been the key for us." To counter Ottawa coach Bryan Murray's No. 1 line, Carlyle has sent out Niedermayer and fellow checkers Travis Moen and Samuel Pahlsson, and blue-line studs Chris Pronger and Scott Niedermayer, asking his players to fill the roles they've been given. Last night before 17,258, the checking line did that -- and more. Pahlsson, the former Boston centerman swapped out of town for distant memories Andrei Nazarov and Patrick Traverse, scored to power his club to a 1-0 win. It wasn't enough that Pahlsson threw a game-high four hits. Or that he helped limit Ottawa's top line -- one that's begging for a breakup upon the Senators' return to Scotiabank Place -- for six shots. Or that he won 10 of 12 faceoffs, while counterpart Jason Spezza, who's sputtered on the big stage, lost 13 of 16 draws. On top of that, Pahlsson gained control of a third-period neutral-zone Ottawa cough-up, looped around, and took off. Pahlsson shook off a backcheck by Ottawa captain Daniel Alfredsson and carried the puck down right wing, stopping short at the faceoff dot. Using Joe Corvo as a screen, Pahlsson snapped a wrist shot through the defenseman's legs and past the blocker of goalie Ray Emery at 14:16. "Great shot," said Murray. "Good play on his part." As much as the center's timely score propelled the Ducks to a second straight win, it was Pahlsson and his teammates' defensive commitment that limited the Senators to 16 shots and resulted in Anaheim counterattacks. Murray, aware that Anaheim's checking line was giving his gunners fits, juggled his lineup to get his stars away from Carlyle's defensive pests. To start the game, Murray sent Mike Fisher out with Alfredsson and Peter Schaefer, and the gritty centerman set the tone by walloping Scott Niedermayer against the boards during the opening shift. But aside from several spare shifts, Alfredsson took his usual right-wing position alongside Spezza and Dany Heatley, who nearly clicked during a five-on-three power play (the second time in two games the Senators have enjoyed a two-man advantage) in the first period. Ottawa had a handful of sparkling scoring chances during the 67-second five-on-three. Winger Mike Comrie, stationed at the right post, stared down an open net but couldn't get his stick untangled. Alfredsson uncorked a pair of shots from the point that thudded off goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere, who came far off his line to cut down the shooting angle. But Giguere's best stop of the power play came on the rare occasion that Ottawa's signature play -- Spezza sending a cross-crease pass to Heatley -- actually clicked. Heatley parked himself at the post and thought, after taking a pass from his centerman, that he had some open net. Giguere, however, shifted from right to left to stone Heatley's stuff. "I thought I was able to [make] the first save and guys were on the rebound right away," said Giguere. "We got pretty fortunate to get out of that one with no goal. We've got to stop taking penalties like that. We can't afford to do that every game. It's going to end up costing us some goals eventually." Giguere made one final game-saving stop. Alfredsson, stickhandling in the left corner, fed Spezza in front. The center gathered the pass and got off a quick shot, but Giguere, stationed correctly and in perfect butterfly position, stopped Spezza's attempt with 4:20 remaining in regulation. But Giguere's teammates made even bigger saves. Late in the third, with Giguere out of position after stopping a Corvo blast, Schaefer settled the rebound and spotted open net. Schaefer's shot, however, went wide when another ex-Bruin, defenseman Sean O'Donnell, got a piece of the puck with his stick. Then in the final minute, when Emery (30 saves) went off for an extra attacker, Alfredsson wound up and ripped a slapper from the point. The shot never got through to Giguere, as Moen hit the deck and blocked Alfredsson's cannon. "It's nice to see the three players getting rewarded for all the hard work," said Carlyle of Moen and his linemates. "They play tough minutes. A lot of times the spotlight has not been directed toward them. Right now, they're in it." Fluto Shinzawa can be reached at &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Young dominated the Pirates again, allowing four hits over seven innings in the San Diego Padres' 9-0 victory Wednesday night. A former Pirates farmhand, Young walked one and struck out seven. Pittsburgh has managed seven hits in 23 2-3 career innings against Young (6-3). ''I think certain guys match up better against certain teams, and he obviously matches up well against us,'' said Jason Bay, who had one of only two extra-base hits against Young. ''The three times he's thrown, obviously, we don't have a lot of him figured out yet.'' Mike Cameron had three hits and three RBIs and Khalil Greene's grand slam in the eighth inning gave San Diego a 7-0 lead. The Padres have won four of five and seven of nine. ''It was a good win for us,'' Young said. ''I felt good. For the most part, I was able to execute my pitches pretty well. I had decent fastball command and for me that's my bread and butter. On nights when I'm able to put my fastball where I want, I'll take my chances.'' Chris Duffy had two hits for the Pirates, who had won four of five. In his two previous starts against Pittsburgh - both last season - Young took a no-hitter into the sixth inning. His no-hit bid June 4 at PNC Park lasted 5 1-3 innings and he allowed two hits in eight shutout innings. On Sept. 22, in San Diego, Young lost a no-hitter with one out in the ninth on Joe Randa's two-run homer. Still, Young downplayed his supremacy over Pittsburgh. ''You've got to get up for every game,'' Young said. ''It's the big leagues and if you don't have your good stuff, teams are going to make you pay. Regardless of who it is, I just try to focus on making good pitches and try to execute my game plan. Some nights it works out and other nights it doesn't.'' Pittsburgh had 11 players on the roster who had faced Young before Wednesday, and they were a combined 3-for-49 (.061) against him. The Pirates went 4-for-24 against him Wednesday. ''We've not been able to do much at all with him,'' Pirates manager Jim Tracy said. ''There is deception to him, obviously, and there's something that we're not seeing.'' The best chance Pittsburgh had to score was in the sixth, when Paul Maholm singled with one out and Jose Bautista followed with a double. But Young got Chris Duffy to foul out down the third base line and Freddy Sanchez to fly out to center. ''I don't think it's ever easy,'' Padres manager Bud Black said. ''It just isn't. It might seem that way at times but it's not.'' The Padres took a 1-0 lead in the third after consecutive singles by Greene and Paul McAnulty off Maholm were followed by a sacrifice by Young and an RBI groundout by Marcus Giles. Young came up with runners on second and third and one out in the fifth. A pitch after fouling off an attempted bunt on a squeeze play, Young lined a single up the middle to score Kevin Kouzmanoff and make it 2-0. ''I'm pleased with how I threw,'' Maholm said. ''But losing, there's no consolation in saying, 'Hey I threw a good game but we lost.''' Cameron's two-out single in the eighth scored Giles and ended Maholm's night. Jonah Bayliss entered the game and walked two batters before Greene's shot to straightaway center. It was the second grand slam of the shortstop's career - the other on Sept. 17, 2005, against Washington - and second of the season for the Padres. Cameron added a two-run double in the ninth. ''We're not the swiftest team or the most powerful team,'' Cameron said. ''But we've got guys who can put a good swing on the baseball.'' Maholm (2-7) was charged with four runs and six hits in 7 2-3 innings with five strikeouts and two walks. The Pirates have won only three of his 11 starts this season. ''He did a great job tonight, he really did,'' Tracy said. ''He takes you into the eighth inning of a 2-0 ballgame that a starter is on the other side of the field that we've had fits with. But we were very much in the baseball game. He deserved a better fate than he got.'' Notes: Pirates OF Xavier Nady was given the night off despite hitting .391 with three home runs and 13 RBIs in his past 11 games. ... The Pirates have never won a series from the Padres at PNC Park. ... With one game remaining in the month, San Diego has allowed 65 runs over 26 games. That is the lowest total in the majors this month by 34. Newspaper Home Delivery - Subscribe Today Privacy Policy/Your California Privacy Right Add USATODAY.com RSS feeds

(AP Photo/Reed Saxon) NEW YORK - The days of seeking out ticket-scalpers in the shadows, ducking into alleys and dodging police for that elusive Yankees-Red Sox seat are fading fast. New York is poised this week to become the latest state to ease or eliminate decades-old restrictions on scalping. For the first time, it would become entirely legal in the state for average fans to scalp their seats on the Internet. And, for better or worse, they could sell those tickets at what ever price the market is willing to bear. The state assembly approved the changes Tuesday. The Senate is expected to follow suit, and Gov. Eliot Spitzer could sign the measure by Friday, when the state's old anti-scalping law expires. "If you have something to sell, you should be able to sell it for what it is truly worth," said Sean Pate, spokesman for the online ticket broker StubHub Inc., which lobbied hard for the change. Some old regulations would stay in place. Scalpers would still be banned from selling tickets within 1,500 feet of large arenas, like Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium, and within 500 feet of smaller venues. Large-volume brokers would still need to get a license, too. It's those brokers who have Russ Haven of the New York Public Interest Research Group worried. Haven argues that lifting the price caps will only prompt greedy opportunists to snap up every available seat, and then jack up prices. "I think this is a bum deal for consumers," Haven said. "As it is, seats to popular events are often selling for 10 times their face price." "It may be that there will be some portion of tickets that go for less than face value, but that's not what they're all banking on," he said of the brokers and ticket agencies pushing for change. Other states have also reconsidered anti-scalping laws. Minnesota tossed its old anti-scalping laws this spring. The state previously allowed tickets to be resold only at face value. A bill that would ease Missouri's ban on selling tickets to sporting events at more than face value passed the legislature and is now before the governor. Illinois and Florida also recently did away with old anti-scalping rules, and bills to ease restrictions are under discussion in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The shift has been propelled in part by the explosion of Internet ticket sales that has made it nearly impossible for states to enforce price caps. New York's old rule limiting a seller's profits to no more than 45 percent over face value has been widely ignored online. But perhaps the biggest change was a switch in business strategy by some of the sports and entertainment companies that previously fought scalping the hardest: Realizing that a multibillion-dollar market was being left untapped, a growing number of teams and theaters have been entering the secondary ticket market themselves. The NCAA signed a deal last year to resell tournament tickets through RazorGator.com. The NBA and some NFL teams have made Ticketmaster their official reseller under an agreement that gives teams a percentage of the profit when a seat is resold. "There is obviously a business opportunity here for us," said Ticketmaster vice president Joseph Freeman. Yet to be seen is how much control sports teams, theaters and concert halls will retain over the tickets being resold. Some have pushed for legislation that would limit reselling to venue-approved brokerages, in part to cut down on the possibility of fraud. Both the New York Yankees and their archrival Boston Red Sox recently made a practice of cracking down on season ticket holders caught selling their unwanted seats on the Internet, in violation of team policy. New York's new rules, if signed in their current form, would actually ban New York sports teams from taking such punitive action. "My feeling is, if I have a ticket, and I can't go to a ballgame, I should certainly have a right to give it to my brother or my cousin , and if they want to pay me for it, why should I have to go through the Yankees to do it?" state Sen. Dean G. Skelos said.

Though approved by the PGA Tour&#44; the move riled many players. This year&#44; Nicklaus said the bunkers will be "furrowed&#44;" thus indicating that they won&#39;t be quite as difficult to escape as in 2006. Here&#39;s what else the Golden Bear had to say during an extensive interview yesterday at the tournament site in Dublin&#44; Ohio. MODERATOR: Would you like to get us started? JACK NICKLAUS: I don&#39;t know what you want me to start with. MODERATOR: Maybe talk a little bit about the golf course. JACK NICKLAUS: Okay&#44; well&#44; golf course is really good. We&#39;ll start off with that. Paul Latshaw and his crew has done a really nice job with the golf course. I sort of expect that. I think that they certainly have the talent and have produced a good golf course every year&#44; so there&#39;s no reason why they wouldn&#39;t continue to do so. And they&#39;ve had a good opportunity to do that. We&#39;ve made a couple of changes on the golf course&#44; which I&#39;m always tweaking the golf course. You know I can&#39;t leave things alone. And the only things that really have been -- that we&#39;ve done this year which are really fairly minor&#44; is that we made the bunkers at the first hole sort of really fit in with the character of the rest of the bunkers on the golf course. We felt that we needed to bring the drainage up&#44; we needed to get them -- the third bunker was way out of play and we moved it back into play down the left side&#44; a little further left and down the hole a little bit. And in an effort to basically try to just encourage the fellows to play the strategy of the golf course. The eighth hole was then more for the members. Members&#39; tees were always sort of a mess there&#44; so we said we&#39;d just get the members&#39; tees in good shape&#44; and as we did that we enlarged the back tee&#44; and it adds maybe three yards to the hole&#44; so it&#39;s not a big deal&#44; but it gives the players a little more space to play from. And the 15th hole&#44; which is a pretty good change&#44; which we&#39;ve been thinking about for years&#44; 15 with equipment has become a very short par 5&#44; actually almost par 4 length&#44; as a matter of fact there&#39;s a lot of par 4s that have been that length&#44; I think it was 501 or 503&#44; and I didn&#39;t want to make it a par 4. I just didn&#39;t think it fit to me to be a par 4 type hole. And so we decided to go back&#44; and we had bleachers behind the tee so we took the bleachers out and moved them across the creek and moved the tee back a little bit&#44; and in an effort to more or less put the driver back in the golfers&#39; hands&#44; right now most of the guys have been hitting 3-wood up to the top of the hill and playing an iron into the green. Now they feel like they have to take a driver to get to the top of the hill before they play into the green&#44; and with it being one of the probably narrowest driving holes on the golf course&#44; it&#39;s going to be exciting. And with the new bleachers that we put back there behind the tee it&#39;s going to be really neat. People are going to find it to be a popular spot because they&#39;ve got the tee shot at 15&#44; they&#39;ve got 14&#44; and they&#39;ll be around to turn backwards and look up 18&#44; so it&#39;s a nice situation there. There was a rest station behind that which we have eliminated and took out&#44; and we haven&#39;t permanently relocated that yet&#44; but we have temporary over to the left of 18 now to replace that. Outside of that&#44; we haven&#39;t done much with the golf course. The bunkers which have been in -- was a bit of a controversial issue last year. What is the Tour version of this? Let me see. I never remember the word. Oh&#44; we&#39;re rough-raking the bunkers now&#44; we&#39;re not furrowing them. What we did is last year&#44; as you may recall&#44; the couple of days or the weekend before the tournament was when the idea of furrowing the bunkers came along&#44; and that went through the Tour process&#44; the Tour approved the process&#44; as a matter of fact the Tour encouraged the process&#44; and so this year we said&#44; okay&#44; what are we going to do to make it more consistent? Last year we ended up having the rake that we had for the crew&#44; and we couldn&#39;t get a rake that size because it was too heavy for the everyday rake&#44; so we had a different size rake and the teeth were not the same size&#44; so we eliminated one of the teeth -- every other tooth on the rake&#44; which left probably a little bigger furrow than we wanted&#44; but that&#39;s really all we had. This year we&#39;re consistent with the size&#44; and we really -- I don&#39;t think the players are going to find it to be a big hazard. Actually it looks about like what the bunkers looked on the Tour for 30 years until we developed the Accuform rake&#44; which is what most of the places have used for the most -- we developed that here&#44; and most of them have used it for the last 20 years&#44; which makes the bunkers very smooth&#44; and we went back basically to the rake that used to be used on the Tour&#44; and in fact most golf courses would use anyway. It puts a little ripple in the sand. Can you get a bad lie? Yeah&#44; you&#39;d be pretty hard pressed&#44; though. I went out on Saturday with that&#44; and I got in six bunkers&#44; one was a long bunker shot and the other five I hit within a foot. I said&#44; well&#44; if I can&#39;t do that I think it&#39;s going to be pretty easy for those guys. I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll be an issue this year&#44; frankly. Q. Do you mind retracing the origins&#44; just a little history lesson&#44; on your vision for this place&#44; just from the very beginning&#44; acquiring the land&#44; why you thought Dublin was it? JACK NICKLAUS: Boy&#44; you&#39;re really asking me to go back. You&#39;re really testing me to see whether this old body and mind can remember things like that? 1966 I sat at The Masters with Ivor Young&#44; and we sat there and said&#44; wouldn&#39;t that be kind of neat to be able to bring back something to Columbus that was similar to what it was at Augusta. We thought Augusta had just done a great service to the game of golf and thought that their tournament was great and certainly would be a good model to work after. And so I asked Ivor to start looking for some land. We found about 11 sites around the area. We looked at two or three of them&#44; and actually first came up -- one of them that came up&#44; came up here. It was not very big. I think it was like 250 acres or something. Maybe 150 acres&#44; the first piece was. And it was a place that I used to come up here as a kid and hunt. I never shot anything but I hunted. I looked a lot (laughter). Anyway&#44; the -- we looked at it and I liked the terrain because I remembered the terrain walking around as a kid&#44; and then we just started expanding on that&#44; and we ended up with 1&#44;260 acres or something like that ultimately. And that was about from 1966 until we started the golf course in the early &#39;70s. We did that in a public offering with the Ohio Company. We did a $9 million offering&#44; of which most of it was due to the infrastructure and the area around this. We got $2.4 million to build the golf course. I think that was spent fairly early on. Of course then because the $2.4 million -- I think we actually did the golf course for $2.5 or $2.6&#44; but we didn&#39;t have money for the clubhouse&#44; so it was a couple years before we built a clubhouse. We opened the golf course in May of &#39;74. We had a Pro-Am -- we thought of having the tournament in &#39;75. We had a Pro-Am here in &#39;75. &#39;76 was the first Memorial Tournament. I could give you more. That&#39;s pretty much in a nutshell. Q. Let me pick up there. How difficult was it then to get a tournament on the PGA Tour? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; I brought -- Joe Dye came out here with me when the golf course was just cleared&#44; and of course he liked the property. The holes were visible from just looking at it from a -- looking through the dirt and the trees&#44; and we sort of -- Joe and I really worked out and developed the idea of what the tournament would be&#44; how it could be&#44; we developed the idea of the Captain&#39;s Club&#44; honoring players of the past. I mean&#44; all that was done before the golf course was even done. And Joe said&#44; I think you need&#44; like&#44; every other tournament to try to get on the Tour. The Tour was full&#44; so you need to pay your dues a little bit. So the Ohio Kings Island Open&#44; in Cincinnati&#44; which was at Kings Island&#44; I think we did two years down there before we transferred the event up here. That was the fore runner. That was the way he justified us having the ability to move into a prime date. Q. Well&#44; now Tiger today is speaking about his event in D.C.. Annika Sorenstam has a tournament being played this week with her name on it. I don&#39;t know what is totally involved with that. I guess the point is what is the interest or the reasons for great players having their own golf tournament? JACK NICKLAUS: I suppose they just like the game. Q. Is it that simple? JACK NICKLAUS: I think that&#39;s about it. They love the game they&#39;ve played and they want to give back a little something to that game in a way of having an event to see if they can do something the way they felt like something should be done. Other times I think it&#39;s probably a promotional thing. I have no idea. Tiger&#39;s position&#44; I don&#39;t think Tiger financially has any real reason to do something like that other than I think that Tiger wants to have the event -- probably as good an event as he can have. I haven&#39;t talked to him about it&#44; so I don&#39;t really know. Q. Well&#44; he&#39;s using it to raise money for his foundation and he wants to build a learning center on the east coast of the United States&#44; which will be somewhere in the D.C. area. That&#39;s the connection. JACK NICKLAUS: Then I think that&#39;s very nice&#44; and I think that&#39;s great. The Children&#39;s Hospital has been the recipient of our benefit from day one. Columbus Children&#39;s Hospital saved my daughter&#39;s life when she was less than a year old&#44; and we felt very strong about that&#44; and so we wanted them to be our recipient of what we did here. There may be personal reasons in doing different things. Barbara and I have always been very heavily involved in what happens with kids and try to do things involved with kids. So for the Memorial to do that and the money we&#39;ve raised here for the hospital&#44; and the hospital has been very kind to us in having a Memorial wing there and so forth and so on&#44; so I think it&#39;s worked very well. The girls here in town have been our volunteers and helped us with the tournament and so forth. It&#39;s a community gathering. Q. Are you looking forward to the Pro-Am tomorrow&#44; and what can we expect out of you? JACK NICKLAUS: No (laughter)&#44; and probably about 80. That&#39;s a pretty quick question&#44; isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m being facetious. I don&#39;t play much golf anymore. Actually&#44; I came up here this weekend just because I wanted to play the golf course&#44; and I played it. I played two days&#44; I shot 79&#44; 83. That&#39;s about my game. I played it from the back. If I play from the front tees I can shoot par or close. I just don&#39;t play anymore&#44; and so to put my golf game out for public display is not necessarily something I want to do. But&#44; you know&#44; we&#39;ll do that tomorrow. I enjoy going around. It&#39;ll be fun. I&#39;ll have a good time with -- there will be a lot of people here that have been friends of mine for a long time&#44; and they&#39;ll see my half a swing that I&#39;ve got left&#44; and that will be about it. They&#39;ll watch me for about two shots&#44; and say&#44; geez&#44; wasn&#39;t it nice to see Jack out here. Then they&#39;ll go watch somebody play golf. Q. Can you draw any parallels with an eye toward history of the big three of your era and the big three today with Woods&#44; Mickelson and Singh? Are they doing some of the same things&#44; dominating their era? JACK NICKLAUS: I have no idea what they&#39;re doing today because I really don&#39;t pay that much attention to it. I know Arnold and Gary and I&#44; we were doing something almost every week together. If we weren&#39;t playing a tournament&#44; we were playing a TV match&#44; we were playing an exhibition&#44; we were doing promotions of different things. We spent a lot of time doing things together. I don&#39;t think the guys today do that. I think that&#39;s a press thing that you guys have created if you wish to create it&#44; and I think it&#39;s -- that you&#39;re just taking the three perceived best players in the game today and calling it that. If we hadn&#39;t been the big three that we had&#44; you wouldn&#39;t know what to call it. Q. What about they&#39;re winning at a rate that could be likened to your era? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; Tiger is winning at that rate. I think Phil has obviously gotten his game back of recent days. He&#39;s played very well lately. Vijay has had a good year this year. We&#39;re delighted to have them all here. I think that the last time they played together was probably&#44; what&#44; Augusta maybe? I don&#39;t know. Maybe they might have played like Wachovia maybe. JACK NICKLAUS: Oh&#44; sure&#44; they played The Players Championship&#44; sure. Phil hasn&#39;t won here&#44; but Phil has come close here. I think the other two -- obviously Tiger has won here three times and Vijay has won here once&#44; I guess. But there&#39;s a lot of other guys playing&#44; too. We&#39;ve got a pretty darn good field this year. We&#39;ve got an excellent field&#44; and I think we&#39;ve got -- have an excellent tournament&#44; and I think we&#39;ll -- hopefully at the end of the week&#44; maybe you can write something about your big three. Q. I remember last year when you talked about furrowing the bunkers it was to try to make the bunkers more of a hazard than it had been in the past. Now when you talk about rough raking the bunkers and say it shouldn&#39;t be much of an issue&#44; I guess my question is then why do it? JACK NICKLAUS: Why do it? It&#39;ll be an issue. In other words&#44; all I&#39;ve ever wanted -- bunkers I think are meant to be a hazard&#44; okay? Why have them otherwise? If they&#39;re meant to be perfect playing conditions&#44; I suppose we ought to put them right next to the cup. The whole idea is that you put them out there to direct play around the golf course for a directional or for a penal aspect if you wish to challenge that area. That&#39;s the same thing as a water hazard or anything else&#44; a water hazard being a little bit more final than a bunker. But the whole idea of the bunker and why I did the furrowing this year or the rough raking&#44; and the rough raking will still do the same thing&#44; it&#39;ll be a place you don&#39;t want to be. It&#39;s not necessarily that I want to create a hazard that&#39;s that penal&#44; I just want them to say&#44; I&#39;m really not sure I really want to be in there because a lot of times guys will say&#44; okay&#44; it&#39;s like the 18th hole here. They look at the water hazard on one side and they&#39;ve got bunkers on the other side. They say&#44; well&#44; obviously I don&#39;t want to be in the water so I&#39;m going to make sure I tug the right side&#44; and if I put it in the bunker it&#39;s no big deal. They whip out the driver and put it in the bunker and knock it on the green. Well&#44; if they put the ball in the bunker this week on the right side&#44; they could get a decent lie or they might not get a good lie. So they&#39;re going to say&#44; hey&#44; I&#39;m not so sure I want to be in there&#44; maybe I ought to play this hole the way it&#39;s designed&#44; maybe I ought to take a 3-wood or 5-wood or 2-iron and put it down there in play and play the way the hole is designed. I&#39;m trying to get them to play the golf course the way it was designed. With today&#39;s golf equipment&#44; the only thing that I know that you try to bring the really&#44; really long hitter and the average length hitter more closely together is to take the driver out of their hands on certain occasions on the golf course. That way you get the guy who&#39;s a shorter hitter to be able to compete with a longer hitter. If you let them just stand there and wail away at it all day long&#44; then the long hitter definitely has a tremendous advantage&#44; particularly with the grooves that we have today. You heard me go through the spiel about 110 top driving accuracy of the guys a couple of years ago. They obviously felt the rough was just as good as that. Well&#44; I don&#39;t want the bunker to be part of that. I want them to think about that bunker and say&#44; okay&#44; I might hug that more than the water&#44; but I really don&#39;t want to be in there so maybe it might be prudent for me to play a 3-wood off and put it in position. That&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do. The rough raking will do that&#44; okay? But the furrows&#44; the Tour was not -- the players were not happy with being totally penalized in the furrowed bunker. Now&#44; if you look at the statistics from last year&#44; the Tour average was something like 46 and a half percent of getting up-and-down. There were like 41 and a half percent or something like that here&#44; so it really wasn&#39;t that much different. 21 of the Top 30 exceeded their own average for the year&#44; were better. Carl Pettersson won the tournament&#44; hit one bunker all week. I don&#39;t know whether that was a fairway bunker or a green side bunker. I suspect it was a green side bunker. Phil Mickelson played a couple of phenomenal shots out of the bunkers here last year. I remember the 6th hole. I remember him playing a shot out of a bunker on the 6th hole and he was sitting down in one of the furrows. Can you play it? Yeah&#44; you can play it but you&#39;ve really got to be good and you&#39;ve got to be a little bit more precise. That&#39;s all we&#39;re trying to do. It&#39;s not necessarily saying it&#39;s not a recoverable area&#44; but it&#39;s a place you don&#39;t want to be. Q. When you were talking about it at first you made it sound like even you could get out of those bunkers. JACK NICKLAUS: I was talking about the green sides. The green side bunkers are not a big issue. The fairway bunkers are really the strategy of the golf course. The green side bunkers are only maybe par 5s where you might stand back at the -- the 5th hole. I really don&#39;t think you want to put it in the bunker anyplace&#44; I don&#39;t care where the bunkers are. The 7th hole&#44; a lot of guys aim for that front bunker because it&#39;s not a very difficult bunker shot if you can get a decent lie. The 11th hole&#44; I don&#39;t think the bunkers are that big a -- to get it in that front left bunker&#44; you really -- you&#39;ve got to -- it&#39;s a heck of a lot easier to hit the green than that bunker. And I think that 15&#44; either one of the green side bunkers are okay&#44; but a lot of guys there are playing -- would be very upset putting it in those bunkers because that&#39;s a hole that really is fairly accessible in two&#44; and that would be a missed shot&#44; not a place you&#39;d be aiming for. I don&#39;t think our par 5 bunkers really fall too much in that category&#44; so it&#39;s more the tee shot -- it&#39;s more the tee shot bunkers I&#39;m concerned about. Q. You&#39;ve got a strong reputation of international players this week&#44; and there&#39;s a bunch every week it seems like on Tour. There&#39;s a thought that the stronger the PGA Tour gets with international players&#44; that it&#39;s going to hurt Europe and Australia and some of these other Tours and they aren&#39;t going to be able to stick around. Any thoughts on that&#44; and was that ever an issue during your prime years? JACK NICKLAUS: What it really means is the game is becoming a global game. It&#39;s becoming -- well&#44; first of all&#44; we&#39;ve come full circle. I mean&#44; British Isles dominated the game the turn of the last century&#44; early part of the last century. The British players&#44; when they came here&#44; I think Ouimet was sort of the change of that guard in 1913. And from that period of time&#44; the United States then coming along with along with the Jones and the Hagens and the Sneads and the Nelsons and Hogans&#44; the U.S. dominated the game for quite a while. And then the game -- I think when the European Tour really became a European Tour&#44; more and more players started coming from Australia and other places&#44; when those tours started producing good players&#44; the game became more significant outside. Now I think what you&#39;re seeing happen&#44; too&#44; is that the PGA Tour has seen that we are no longer a U.S. game and that we are a world game. I think Tim has been very successful in being able to really create another level of tournaments at the top of the PGA Tour&#44; and those tournaments are really geared to a large degree to attract international players&#44; the world tournaments and of course the major tournaments and the year-end tournaments&#44; are all geared to a large degree to bring in all the best players to play in those events. And in doing so&#44; are they going to hurt some other Tours? Probably. But they&#39;re probably also going to hurt our own Tour&#44; too. I mean&#44; if you look at the guys&#44; the top players&#44; and I think this is always the issue that you&#39;ve always got to watch out for&#44; is that the top players are going to play maybe 15 tournaments a year is probably what they play. That&#39;s about what Tiger plays&#44; they might play 20 tournaments. I think most of your players from overseas will play more than the 12 or 15. They&#39;ll probably play those tournaments here that revolve in that sort of a world-U.S. Tour is what it is&#44; but they&#39;ll go back and support their own Tour to some level. You see the Europeans go back&#44; they play Wentworth last week&#44; they&#39;ll go back and play when the British Open goes they&#39;ll play there. The European Tour I don&#39;t think will suffer a lot&#44; but probably they&#39;ll see some of their players playing more events here. You&#39;ll have the same thing with Australia and Africa and Japan. You&#39;re seeing more and more of those players playing an our Tour. But they still go back and support their own tours. But that&#39;s been the case for a long time. It&#39;s been that way for quite a while&#44; and it&#39;s becoming more so that way with the coming of these new world tournaments. Q. Is it truly a global game if all the big global events are in the U.S.? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; it&#39;s where most of the sponsors are for the money. I think that what&#39;s going to happen is that you&#39;re going to find that as the international players become stronger&#44; as events -- I think Tim and I talked this morning about it&#44; he said that he thinks we need to have more of the international move into that. He asked me an awful lot of places where we&#39;re doing golf courses around the world that might be able to house in the future what&#39;s going on. Not today&#44; but within the next five or six years he sees that happening more and the necessity to do so. If you look at the match play this year&#44; there were 64 players&#44; only 22 of them were U.S. players. You&#39;re pretty blind if you don&#39;t see that the game is a global game. So if you&#39;re going to play a global game&#44; you&#39;ve got to play globally. So the U.S. Tour will probably -- the European Tour saw that quite a while ago. They started doing that&#44; and you see them&#44; they play through South Africa&#44; they play through Asia&#44; they play Australia&#44; they play quite a few places other than Europe in their cold season. So they&#39;ve truly become a global Tour&#44; also. And I think that the result of the players they&#39;re having has been reflected in the Ryder Cup and I think it reflects in the Presidents Cup&#44; too. Q. Sounds like you&#39;re saying the European Tour is a global Tour because of where they go. The U.S. is a global Tour because of who they get. JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; if you look at Europe&#44; Europe doesn&#39;t have any warm weather. Maybe the south of Spain in -- Q. They don&#39;t get any good weather in July&#44; do they? JACK NICKLAUS: I think they do. I think 4th of July summer happens&#44; doesn&#39;t it? Maybe not the 3rd or the 5th&#44; but it happens (laughter). Anyway&#44; I think that the U.S. Tour&#44; we have a lot of warm places. We don&#39;t play in the northern part of the United States in the wintertime obviously&#44; we play in the southern part of the United States. I mean&#44; I think that you have to give Tim a chance. You know&#44; he&#39;s doing&#44; I think&#44; a terrific job for the Tour. He&#39;s really trying to -- he&#39;s working very hard to keep a lot of sponsors happy. He&#39;s working very hard to keep a lot of players happy. He&#39;s trying to figure out what is best for the Tour and how to work it and how to expand it over time&#44; and he&#39;s -- I&#39;m sure he&#39;s not hesitant to have blinders on in relationship to what you&#39;re talking about. So I think time will tell and give him a chance to do so. That&#39;s the only answer I have. I don&#39;t have another answer other than you&#39;re trying to say a global Tour shouldn&#39;t be all U.S. I think he agrees with that&#44; too. Q. Fair or unfair&#44; warranted or unwarranted&#44; do you feel like the path -- the road that Tiger has to shatter your majors record is an easier road than he&#39;s been able to take versus what you had to do to get to the mark that you got to? JACK NICKLAUS: I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s an easier road or not. I think that -- I did not have a focus on that when I was growing up. That was never a focus to me until after I was over ten tournaments&#44; and somebody even pointed it out to me that I had won 10. But Tiger had&#44; I think&#44; a tougher road in a lot of ways from the standpoint that he -- from day one&#44; that&#39;s what his goal was&#44; was to surpass my record&#44; and he&#39;s been -- the press has had that from day one. That&#39;s a lot of pressure on a guy for a long time. You look at it from that standpoint&#44; I think maybe he had a tougher way. If you look at it from the standpoint of the competition&#44; I&#39;m not sure what the answer to that is. I&#39;ve said several times and I&#39;ve said lately&#44; I don&#39;t know whether -- there was a level of competition when I played&#44; and I&#39;d say some of the time I might have been just a little bit above that. And the guys today are either at the same level we were and Tiger is up here (indicating high up)&#44; or the guys today -- I had Trevino&#44; Palmer&#44; Player&#44; Watson&#44; guys that won a lot of major championships&#44; I don&#39;t know whether the guys today would maybe be a notch below that and Tiger was up here at this notch. We don&#39;t know that&#44; but there&#39;s no way you&#39;ll ever know that. There&#39;s no way to compare it. All you know is that Tiger is dominating what&#39;s going on. And when he plays and when he&#39;s playing well&#44; he is really difficult to beat. We have seen a lot of guys not be able to finish tournaments when he&#39;s playing. Is that pushing themselves beyond the level of what they are or are they trying to reach a level that they can&#39;t attain? We don&#39;t know the answer to that. We can sit there and do all kinds of things and say that the guys today can&#39;t finish and Tiger is the only guy that can play&#44; or we can say that the guys today are really&#44; really good and Tiger is just way above them. I just don&#39;t know how to answer your question because I don&#39;t think -- we never will have an answer for that incidentally. Q. I guess you could also argue that the purses are so much now that these guys aren&#39;t relying on making the money where in your era everybody was trying to make a buck and the money wasn&#39;t going around as much as it is now. JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; we didn&#39;t play golf to make a living. We played golf to create a record so we could go make a living. The guys today make a living playing golf. I mean&#44; the prize money that they play for nowadays&#44; they don&#39;t have to do other stuff to make a living. So it&#39;s a big difference from that standpoint&#44; but that wouldn&#39;t have any difference in relation to how they play golf. I think that there is a tendency for guys&#44; I think -- and it was the same in our era&#44; that guys really are satisfied with being in the Top 5 or 10 on the Money List&#44; they have a really nice living&#44; they enjoy their family&#44; they enjoy spending time at home&#44; they don&#39;t need to push it out and play 35&#44; 40 tournaments a year. There are some guys that will do that&#44; and there&#39;s some guys that fall in that category. We had some guys that fell in that category&#44; too. But I think that&#39;s human nature. I think that&#39;s the way some people are built. Some people say I don&#39;t care about being the best player in the world. This is where I make my living&#44; I do very well and I&#39;m really good at it. Do I have to be the best? No. Do I have to sacrifice all this to be the best? Maybe not. Some of them will&#44; some of them won&#39;t. Tiger does. I think if you asked the guys on the Tour and find out who probably has the best work ethic&#44; you&#39;ll probably look and find that it&#39;s Tiger&#44; Phil and then Vijay. You&#39;re talking about your three top players probably have the best work ethic. Are there other guys that have a good work ethic? Sure. Maybe some of them don&#39;t have quite as much talent as some of the other guys&#44; but that&#39;s a question that -- and plus the fact that the game is so different. I mean&#44; the equipment we&#39;re playing today&#44; the courses we&#39;re playing&#44; the conditions were playing are so different. It&#39;s at a totally different -- not only a different era but a different game. So to answer your question&#44; there is no answer. It&#39;s all guessing from all of us. But I know one thing. Tiger is one hell of a player (laughter). Q. From an architectural standpoint&#44; what makes Oakmont so special&#44; and what about &#39;62 do you remember most&#44; just about the tournament itself? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; coming into Oakmont in &#39;62&#44; I had finished second and fourth the two previous years. I felt like I had a really&#44; really good opportunity in both of those years as an amateur to win the Open. I didn&#39;t finish in either one of those. I came into Oakmont having three seconds my first year on the Tour and finishing second the week prior to the U.S. Open&#44; having a putt at the last hole to tie&#44; which was a long putt&#44; about 35 feet&#44; but I missed it. I went to Oakmont with sort of blinders on&#44; saying that I love USGA events&#44; I love the setup of the golf course&#44; I had played Oakmont in practice and I liked Oakmont&#44; and I felt like that was my week. I had no idea -- it sounds sort of stupid&#44; but I&#39;m a 22-year-old kid&#44; wouldn&#39;t have any idea that I was in Arnold Palmer&#39;s backyard. It wouldn&#39;t have ever entered my mind. It only entered my mind that this was what I wanted to do&#44; and I felt like that was going to be my week and I played it that way. I had a good week of putting. I didn&#39;t make a lot of putts&#44; but I only three-putted one in 90 holes. But I obviously made enough. I remember I got a comment on the 17th hole of the last round&#44; I had a putt for a par after I sort of drove it up by the green and sort of fluffed a chip shot&#44; pitched it about five feet by&#44; and I got a note from Bobby Jones that said I came right out of my chair when you hit that putt. I whapped it downhill&#44; one of those&#44; about five feet. It was kind of a -- and then of course I got -- Arnold couldn&#39;t have treated me nicer during the week. We played the first two rounds together&#44; and then of course the playoff. It sort of started a rivalry&#44; as you might say&#44; in our competition. Oakmont is a good golf course&#44; a tough golf course. It&#39;s a golf course that I have no idea what they&#39;ve done to it this time. I know that they&#39;ve lengthened some stuff on it&#44; and I hate to see them lengthen it beyond because&#44; like&#44; Oakmont was the kind of golf course that you really didn&#39;t need to try to take a driver out of their hands. The golf course in its very nature took the driver out of your hands a lot of the ways it&#39;s played. So I didn&#39;t think that length was going to be all that major of a factor&#44; but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve added some length. The only conversation I get is the 8th hole&#44; which is -- JACK NICKLAUS: That I don&#39;t understand&#44; but that was already a 1-iron or a 3-wood. It was already one of the toughest par 3s you&#39;d ever want to play&#44; and I think they added 50 yards to it? Q. 36 effectively&#44; 252 to 288. JACK NICKLAUS: It wasn&#39;t 252 when I played it. It was 230-something. I thought that was pretty long. I think Oakmont has always produced a good champion. Q. Was &#39;62 that you touched on&#44; that was kind of the beginning of everything with you and Arnold. I know you&#39;re not thinking that at the time&#44; but how special in the end -- I know you said you didn&#39;t know it was Arnold&#39;s backyard&#44; but how special was that victory? Was that the spring board for you? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; I mean&#44; it&#39;s my first win. That&#39;s pretty special. How special is your first win? And how special is it if it&#39;s a U.S. Open? I don&#39;t think I have to say more than that right there. It obviously set my career up. Q. Do you remember Arnold&#39;s kind of -- I think he made the turn at the end&#44; last round&#44; Arnold was up two or three and he stubbed one at 9 and - JACK NICKLAUS: I wasn&#39;t playing with him. I have no idea what he did at that particular time. I don&#39;t even remember what I shot the last round. I don&#39;t think I shot but 71 maybe. Maybe I didn&#39;t. Maybe I shot 69&#44; I don&#39;t remember. Q. A lot has been made of the Oakmont greens. How do they relate to other U.S. Open greens? Do they weigh more on your mind? JACK NICKLAUS: They&#39;re a tough set of greens. JACK NICKLAUS: Not necessarily faster&#44; they&#39;re just a lot pitchier. Q. When you think about this tournament&#44; how much of the popularity and the prestige of this event with the fans and players is tied to you directly and your presence here&#44; and how much is the course and everything else around it? Because for instance&#44; unfortunately&#44; the Byron Nelson this year was going on without its host. How much of this event is you and how much is everything else that&#39;s been created around you? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; I&#39;d like to think the event can stand on its own two feet without me. Obviously I think it&#39;s -- it would be kind of stupid to say that I haven&#39;t been an integral part of the event. But I think that the structure of the event -- it is The Memorial Tournament&#44; it does honor the players of the past&#44; our Captain&#39;s Club has been supportive of what we&#39;ve done. They&#39;ve been our guiding light in terms of what we&#39;ve done with the direction of the tournament. It is set in place that I can be here or I don&#39;t have to be here&#44; from that standpoint. From a personal standpoint I hope I&#39;m around for a long time to enjoy it. But the -- I think today it&#39;s probably still hard to separate me from the tournament&#44; but I think as time goes on and you look at The Masters&#44; you look at the Bobby Jones was synonymous with Augusta no matter what happened there&#44; and The Masters really has lived beyond Jones&#44; even though his -- what&#39;s the right word? Even though his legacy is there and will always be there and mine will always be here. Q. Have you thought about that much ever? JACK NICKLAUS: I don&#39;t really want to think too much about it&#44; thank you&#44; right now (laughter). I&#39;m getting old enough as it is&#44; I don&#39;t want to think too much about that. That&#39;s not necessary for people to walk around every day and think about it. Q. But are there things you&#39;ve done along the years to purposely make sure this event doesn&#39;t just have to be about you? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; I think I went through that just five minutes ago with you. Everything I just said is what we did. It&#39;s not the Jack Nicklaus Open&#44; it&#39;s The Memorial Tournament. I don&#39;t see that my name needs to be involved in the tournament&#44; period&#44; I would certainly hope it isn&#39;t. But I think that&#39;s the way -- this is the way we&#39;ve tried to structure it&#44; tried to create a golf course -- and these players come back here every year&#44; they don&#39;t come back and say&#44; gee&#44; I want to go to Jack&#39;s tournament because it&#39;s Jack&#39;s tournament. They say I want to go to The Memorial Tournament because it&#39;s a great golf course and we&#39;re treated well and it&#39;s a great event. Q. Could you tell us about Kyle Reifers and your decision to give him an exemption this week? JACK NICKLAUS: I don&#39;t know Kyle very well. I had lunch with him yesterday. I&#39;ve met him on a couple of occasions&#44; but the Captain&#39;s Club does the exemptions. I have nothing to do with that&#44; zero. I set that up a long time ago for exactly that reason (laughter). I mean&#44; I get 100 letters every year from players wanting an exemption to the golf tournament&#44; and they go right to these gentlemen sitting in the back of the room here who make the selection of who the exemptions are&#44; and thank goodness you guys do that. I appreciate that very much. Q. I believe in the past you&#39;ve been - JACK NICKLAUS: I&#39;m sorry&#44; excuse me. But we&#39;re delighted to have him here. How&#39;s that? I&#39;m sorry. Q. I believe in the past you have cited the golf ball as maybe the culprit with regards to making some of the grand old courses obsolete. This year the buzz word seems to be maybe&#44; again&#44; the U-grooves and the USGA is going to possibly look at that. Do you think those clubs should be banned and the U-grooves with the ability of the players to get the ball to check&#44; how would that play into the setup of the course? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; I think that the grooves are an issue&#44; they&#39;ve always been an issue. When we talked a minute ago with the driving -- two years ago when the Top 5 were not in the top 110 of driving accuracy and they were the top players&#44; it didn&#39;t make any difference. So obviously it was more important then to hit the ball long than it was to hit it straight. Grooves will obviously play a thing. I mean&#44; I see television and I watch the guys playing out of rough like this and I see the ball go&#44; shooooom. I say&#44; God&#44; there&#39;s no way in the world we could ever do that. I guess I could do it today because I could get those clubs. I still don&#39;t play with those clubs. I play with V grooves and I have all my life just because I like the flight of a golf ball. I personally have never liked the flight of what a U groove does because it&#39;s square grooves or whatever you want to call them. Out of the rough I like to be able to take the ball and play my trajectory and throw it up softly. Sure&#44; the way they do it today&#44; they&#39;ve tried to combat the effective what they do&#44; they get them harder than they could get them&#44; with all the technical ways they can dry out greens today&#44; to where you almost need them. Do they have an advantage with them around the green? Probably so. I think the U grooves are about that much of a problem (indicating one inch)&#44; and I think regardless of what the USGA is saying&#44; I still think that the ball is 85 to 90 percent of the problem and would solve 85 to 90 percent of our problems. And then I know that the USGA and the PGA Tour and the R & A are working on golf balls that go shorter all the time. They are going through that to try and test the manufacturers who are making them to find out what results they get back from that kind of a situation. Now&#44; if they thought -- of course they&#39;re going through U grooves all the time&#44; they&#39;re going through the trampoline effect of drivers. Obviously if they took a driver and made it smaller&#44; the size of the face would make it smaller and you couldn&#39;t have the trampoline effect that you have today. All those things are factors. But I would say the U groove is probably about that much&#44; the driver is about that much and the ball is about that much. That&#39;s my own opinion. That&#39;s opinion from observation. We have had the USGA here last year and spoke to our Captain&#39;s Club and gave us a great presentation. They felt that it was probably 80 percent grooves and head and a small part ball. They do far more research than I do. I don&#39;t do research&#44; but I&#39;ve played the game and seen it played for too many years&#44; and I see what&#39;s happened. That&#39;s my feeling. That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m right&#44; but the -- and frankly&#44; I really don&#39;t care if they play exactly the same equipment today forever. The only thing that I care about is the game itself and the historical and great golf courses that we have around the world that we play that have become non-championship golf courses&#44; or if they want to keep them championship golf courses&#44; the amount of money that is spent to bring them to a new level&#44; and what it does on a daily basis to the members of those people that play the golf courses on a daily basis&#44; and how it separates the professional game of golf from the average golfer. The whole idea of the USGA and the R & A and everybody playing the same equipment&#44; they couldn&#39;t be further apart. That&#39;s the problem. In an effort to do that&#44; it&#39;s become -- they&#39;ve become like this (indicating close together) rather than like this. Q. Have you ever had to lobby players to play your tournament? Do you still lobby? JACK NICKLAUS: Never have asked a player to play. We&#39;ve been here 32 years&#44; 33 years? Never asked a player to player in 32 years. Q. One thing about the Masters that - JACK NICKLAUS: In other words&#44; to expound on that&#44; I&#39;ve always felt like if a guy -- if we produce a tournament&#44; if we produce the purse&#44; the golf course&#44; the event&#44; handle the players and the players want to come&#44; they&#39;ll come. If they don&#39;t come&#44; they&#39;ll have their own reason for not doing it&#44; and if they do come&#44; then they&#39;ll come here because of what we provided for them. Q. Last year as I recall you didn&#39;t have Tiger for sure. Is it true that the ratings were down? JACK NICKLAUS: I have no idea. I don&#39;t read ratings. I have no idea what they were. Q. Do you think if affects - JACK NICKLAUS: Do I think Tiger affects the game? JACK NICKLAUS: I think it affects any tournament. I don&#39;t think it makes any difference what tournament you&#39;re playing if Tiger doesn&#39;t play. I think if Tiger skips The Masters or the British Open this year because he&#39;s having a baby&#44; the ratings will be changed for sure. Tiger is a very popular player no matter where he&#39;s playing. I don&#39;t think it makes any difference. Q. The observation I was going to make for whatever it&#39;s worth&#44; is the Masters&#44; I think&#44; has continued -- if you look back all the great players from every era has won that tournament. How would that help you? Do you think you&#39;re close to that here with your tournament? JACK NICKLAUS: I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re driving at. Q. Well&#44; my point is&#44; I think that the Masters&#44; there&#39;s a lot of reasons why The Masters is the Masters&#44; but one very interesting thing is you can hardly name a great player of an era that hasn&#39;t won that golf tournament. JACK NICKLAUS: We&#39;re pretty close to that here I would think if you look at our winners. That&#39;s part of a good tournament. Part of a good tournament is produce good winners. But also give it the ability to have a dark horse&#44; as you might say&#44; win&#44; or an underdog&#44; however you want to call it. If you have somebody who is not necessarily given the ability to be able to get there&#44; that&#39;s -- see&#44; that&#39;s the one criticism that I&#39;ve had of recent years of Augusta is that I felt like the things they&#39;ve done to the golf course have reduced the chances of getting a broad spectrum of players from the shorter hitter to the moderate hitter to the big hitter&#44; giving them a chance to win. That&#39;s one of the reasons why I&#39;ve lengthened some things here but I&#39;ve resisted in lengthening everything here. I&#39;ve tried to create a little bit more variety in that and keep my short holes&#44; keep my -- the 3rd hole&#44; the 14th hole here&#44; the 9th hole are not very long holes&#44; and they play -- and they give the -- and our par 5s are not extremely long. And they give the average hitting pro a good chance to play it rather than just the power hitter. Now&#44; Augusta has also started to narrow it in&#44; too&#44; with the power&#44; so they&#39;re working in that direction. But I think it&#39;s still the stronger hitter that has a better chance at Augusta than the other guys. Q. With respect to Tiger&#39;s effect on the game&#44; do you think it&#39;s better for the game if he would have a rival who would measure up to him? JACK NICKLAUS: I guess if somebody can play that well. That&#39;s all it amounts to. That was the thing I was going through earlier. I said&#44; are all these guys down here and he is way up here&#44; or are all these guys down here with the list of other good players that have ever played&#44; and he&#39;s that far above them? We don&#39;t know the answer to that. We don&#39;t know if anybody can get to that level. Right now nobody is. Q. There seems to be this feeling that Phil with Butch might be capable of getting to that level. JACK NICKLAUS: (Shrugging shoulders) I guess you&#39;ll see. Phil is a very&#44; very good player&#44; been a good player for a lot of years. Phil went a long time before he won his first major. When he won his first major&#44; then he learned how to do that&#44; and he&#39;s won several since then. He is probably obviously the closest to that situation at the present time&#44; and he&#39;s still young enough that he still has years to go in that. Q. I mean&#44; you remember - JACK NICKLAUS: Is it good in the game to have more than one guy? Yes&#44; of course it is. Q. Because your rivalry with Arnold&#44; more people got interested - JACK NICKLAUS: When Arnold and Gary and I were playing&#44; it was like if one of us didn&#39;t come to the tournament&#44; the tournament was a total failure. Well&#44; at least we had three of us they were talking about. Today if Tiger doesn&#39;t come&#44; they say it&#39;s a total failure. I mean&#44; that&#39;s a pretty big burden to be put on one guy. Is that really fair? There&#39;s really an awful lot of good players that produce an awful lot of good tournaments out here&#44; good golf. Q. I guess that&#39;s a good question. A lot of tournament directors moan and complain about field sizes and who&#39;s in the field and Tiger is not there and it&#39;s a disaster. You&#39;ve run this tournament or the Captain&#39;s Club for years and years and years. Is it that important that certain players come to your event? Can&#39;t you run a successful event and a good event without having a Tiger Woods or a Phil Mickelson in it? JACK NICKLAUS: Well&#44; we can&#44; but you guys won&#39;t let us (laughter). That&#39;s part of it. I mean&#44; did we have a successful event last year? I think we had a great event last year. Tiger wasn&#39;t here because of his father&#44; but Tiger supported us very well here. I certainly never have a complaint about Tiger. I&#39;m just delighted that he wants to come and play here. You know&#44; can we have an event without a player? Sure&#44; of course we can. Do I want to? No&#44; I want to have all the best players here. That&#39;s what we all want to have. All tournaments want that. Why wouldn&#39;t they? I&#39;m going to have a tournament next week and I&#39;m going to put up whatever prize money we&#39;re going to play for and I don&#39;t want any of the Top 10 to come because I want to see if we can -- come on. Q. My question is you said you don&#39;t look at ratings. You have the same sponsors of the event - JACK NICKLAUS: No&#44; I don&#39;t. I have no idea what our ratings were last year. My guess is they were probably down because Tiger wasn&#39;t here&#44; but I have no idea what they were&#44; and I have no idea how that related to the rest of the Tour and golf last year. I just don&#39;t have a clue. Morgan Stanley might (laughter). Q. But with everything you put into the event&#44; the event was still successful&#44; you still made a lot of money for charity&#44; and you still did everything you wanted to do? JACK NICKLAUS: Absolutely&#44; absolutely&#44; so we&#39;ve just got to get you guys to write differently (laughter). MODERATOR: Mr. Nicklaus&#44; thank you very much.

It goes deep into one issue and then bounces around to a plethora of smaller ones ... and does it all in a way that will make you feel like the prettiest girl at the cotillion. Bookmark , and visit daily. Kobe Bryant trade imbroglio ends up being very bad news for two people: Andrew Bynum and the Lakers "insider" who told the LA times that Kobe Bryant forced the Lakers to trade Shaquille O'Neal. I don't know who you are, , but right about now might be a good idea to touch up your resume. You almost cost your organization its most prized asset. In the business world, this is frowned upon. It's like an employee walking into Kentucky Fried Chicken headquarters tomorrow and announcing to that he sold his secret recipe to Boston Chicken. If Kobe wants the anonymous insider fired, then firing him should be the that the Lakers do to him. Assuming that the insider is anyone other than Jerry Buss (and who knows, it could be Buss; if you get that guy liquored up, he'll do anything ), Kobe is obviously far more important to the organization. If Kobe wants them to pour sugar in the guy's gas tank, then send Smush Parker to the store to pick up a bag of When a team has a player like Kobe Bryant, they keep him at all costs. How many players in the league are world champions, proven clutch performers, have a complete offensive game, exert themselves on defense, and can score in every conceivable way? It doesn't matter what he wants done. Do it. If it's necessary, build a Kobe Bryant statue in front the Staples center just like the Jordan statue in Chicago. In fact, it shouldn't just be a statue, it should be a fountain. Just like the one to your right, except it would be Kobe peeing on the face of the Lakers "insider." Kobe might like it, and it would look fantastic in front of Staples. The insider may be a perfectly nice man or woman, and an otherwise valuable employee. And really, it doesn't even matter if what he said about Kobe is factually accurate. What matters is that Kobe wants him gone. I hate to call for anyone to be fired, but if Kobe wants it, it's going to happen. Does the insider believe that Kobe has the juice to force a Shaq trade, but he couldn't get any The question is, though, what else does Bryant want? And this leads us back to Andrew Bynum, whose fate was sealed yesterday the second Kobe told Stephen A. Smith he wanted to be traded. Even after Kobe rescinded his request, the message will still there: he's serious about this, he's had enough front office failings, and he will continue to embarrass the organization until he's satisfied. He's forced their hand. And hey, someone had to. There's an overwhelming likelihood that Bynum is history. He's the most valuable young trade chip the Lakers have, he's been the sticking point in previous uncompleted deals, and using him as trade bait is the Lakers best chance at pacifying Kobe. A trade is still going to happen, it's just not going to be Kobe. It's going to be Bynum, for someone who Bryant likes. And that's the best thing for everyone, the Lakers organization included. There's a reason that you can't get equal value in a deal for someone like Kobe ... because any other player in the league that it's in the same stratosphere as Kobe is not going to be traded . The Lakers would've ended up taking a collection of lesser players (which never, ever works out for the team giving up the best player), draft picks (unless they're the #1 or #2 pick in this year's draft, not a surefire recipe for success), or expiring contracts to be converted to cap space (in recent years, proven to be vastly overrated). There were no options the Lakers had that would've improved their team, or even kept it afloat. Tracy McGrady? Unless he comes with a set of attachable testicles that he's never before used in his career, that's a clear and significant downgrade for the Lakers. Kevin Garnett? That's a little too " Gift of the Magi " for me. Both guys have always wanted to play with someone like the other one, but it ends up being, "Awww, I traded my Garnett to get you a Kobe!" "But I traded my Kobe to get you a Garnett!" The end result leaves both of them in the same situation they're in now. Trading him would have been a disaster. Equal value was a pipe dream, the fans would have revolted, and the organization would have lost their cash cow. And they'd have had a roster no better than that of Portland, Minnesota, Sacramento, or Memphis. Five years from now, the Lakers might be looking back on May 30th, 2007 as the day their franchise was saved. Twice. Kobe saved them the first time by spurring them into action, hopefully helping them to see that wasting the prime of the most dynamic scorer in the NBA is a bad idea. And then Phil Jackson saved them a second time by talking Kobe off the ledge and back into a Laker uniform. Kobe Bryant will take some heat for what he did yesterday. He'll be called selfish, instable, insane, etc. But if you're Kobe, how does sitting idly by while the franchise wastes your prime help anyone? He did the right thing. For himself, for the league, for the fans, and for the Lakers. Someday, they're going to thank him for it. I'm considering adding a mailbag feature to The Debriefing. No promises, we'll see how it goes. If you've got a question (about something you've read here, or about any issue on your mind, sports-related or otherwise), feel free to drop an e-mail to: Oh, you're damn right I will be watching when. I agree , that's fantastic. The black and white, the old school warriors, the stone determination on the faces, tying yesterday to today ... for a promo spot that doesn't involve the Pussycat Dolls, that's not bad, ABC. And somewhere, Craig Sager breathes a sigh of relief. That's a really nice flower on your lapel, Don Cherry... it'd be even nicer if anyone could see the damn thing. I guess Don isn't ready to let go of the " " trend just yet. They won't let him wear shorts, so he makes a whole damn suit out of it. Quickly on Spurs vs. Jazz, Game 5 ... &bull; Something I'm pretty sure the Jazz didn't want to hear today: "Leading scorer, Andrei Kirilenko." No member of the Jazz had more than 13 points. &bull; Someone owes Derek Fisher an apology. Fish went to a lot of trouble to get from his daughter's eye procedure in New York to last night's "game" in San Antonio. He didn't get there until halftime, and by then, all was over but the shouting. Actually, the shouting was over, too. The Spurs don't shout. &bull; If there's such a thing as a key stat in a complete and utter blowout, it's this: Spurs: 22 assists, 7 turnovers. Jazz: 13 assists, 12 turnovers. &bull; If you want to see a competitive NBA Finals, hop on the Pistons bandwagon. The Pistons, if they get there and they manage to bring an appropriate level of intensity, could at least compete with the Spurs. The Cavaliers would make the Jazz look like the '92 Bulls. Seriously, if the Cavs win the Eastern Finals (a real possibility, given Detroit's afore-mentioned intensity problem), the Spurs might as well face the Washington Generals. They would be the worst team the Spurs have faced yet in the playoffs by a wide, wide margin. Fair Warning, Otter ... The newest scourge of America's golf courses: . A couple of golfers were attacked on a Florida golf course by rabid otters who were pissed off about something or other. "There's a pond on that hole -- it's a short par 3," Stafford said. "(The otter) was on the grass. He or she was just staring at me. "All of a sudden he charged me and bit my ankle," she said. "There are three punctures." A word to the wise to any otters who might be reading: you better wait until I don't have a club in my hand to attack me. I'm a nature-lover, but if you're foaming at the mouth, and you snarl your otter teeth at me, I'm tattooing your adorable otter face with a titanium 3-wood. Well Hello, Brand New Professional Football League ... I cruised around a few blogs earlier looking for opinions on , the brand spankin' new football league in which Mark Cuban will own a team. And the general consensus seems to be that it will die a quick and laughable death . I'm not writing it off that quickly. Here's the biggest reason I give them a chance: the NFL's current collective bargaining agreement sucks for the players. Hockey players might even get better deals. Only signing bonuses are guaranteed, and unless you're a first-round pick, that signing bonus is going to be no great shakes. Would a guy like 2nd-round draft pick Dwayne Jarrett take a 4-year, $6 million guaranteed deal over what he's going to end up getting from the Carolina Panthers? Maybe, maybe not. But it's not a ridiculous notion. Would they be able to land any star players? Not in their prime, no. At least not right away. But aging veterans in the NFL tend to get shoved out the door. No one wants to pay an established veteran when they can get a younger guy much cheaper: it happens to running backs all the time. If the UFL existed right now, who's to say they wouldn't pay a guy like Keyshawn Johnson? Arena Football, the XFL, NFL Europa ... they pay guys beer money. It doesn't sound like the UFL is going to be that kind of venture. And basically, I believe this: doesn't do a lot of dumb things with his money. Billionaires aren't billionaires because they invest haphazardly. And the same is probably doubly true of So I think they've got some things working in their favor. If the UFL offers guaranteed money and it's competitive with what the NFL offers, I don't see why they couldn't land some talent and put a good product on the field. Of course, the other possibility is that this whole thing just turns into the best thing to ever happen to the NFL Players Union. If the UFL develops into something that looks like a real threat, the NFL would probably opt to just rework their collective bargaining agreement to up the pay and keep all decent players in the NFL. They can certainly afford to, but to this point, the NFLPA has failed to give them any reason to do so. If Jerry Porter was a Better Football Player, He Wouldn't Have This Problem ... Raiders wide receiver Jerry Porter wanted to switch numbers. He previously wore 84, and he wanted 81. He asked the league to switch. The league said he could ... for a mere $210,000 As it turns out, if you want to switch numbers, you have to reimburse the team and Reebok for the cash value of the unsold jerseys with your old number on them. Porter's getting jacked here. $210,000? What's that come out to, 105,000 jerseys? When's the last time you saw someone rocking a Jerry Porter jersey? Right now, those things aren't worth the raw fabric of which they are composed. Here's an idea, Jerry: do something to make people want to buy your jersey , and you won't have this problem. Things that would include, I don't know, actually getting on the field, catching passes, and scoring touchdowns. . Honestly, Alex, I didn't think you had this kind of craftiness in you. It's odd that I actually respect for the man on the same day he's on the front of the New York Post with a woman who isn't his wife. That probably says more about me than him. Oh well. Anyway, last night, as A-Rod was on third base, a popup fluttered in the direction of Toronto third baseman Howie Clark. As Clark was about to catch it, Rodriguez yelled. He says he yelled, "Hah!" while others say he yelled, "I got it!" Either way, it worked, and I think it's awesome. Clark dropped the ball. The Jays didn't like it. "The thing about the Yankees, one of the reasons they're so respected, is they do things right. Always have," manager John Gibbons said. "They've got a lot of pride and a lot of class. They play the game hard. "That's not Yankee pride right there," he said. "That's not the way they play. I thought it was bush league." Have you seen the standings, friend? The Yankees bush league. Was it gamesmanship by A-Rod? Yes. Was it devious? Sure. Was it unethical? Maybe. Is Howie Clark a professional who should be aware of where his teammates are and be able to block out distractions around him? Yes. Sorry, Howie. No one likes to be made to look like a chump, and I feel for you, but this is not golf. You are not entitled to silence. . I hate to do it to you, Deron, since you were playing through illness and all, but Tony Parker outscored you by 10, had 3 more assists, and turned it over 2 fewer times. If the Jazz weren't winning the point guard battle, they had no chance. Williams finished with 11 points, 2 assists, and 2 turnovers ... and he couldn't even begin to think about guarding Parker.

Calling Cleveland the worst team San Antonio will have played in the playoffs "by a wide wide margin" is simply ludicrous. I'm curious as to how Utah is better than Cleveland by any margin. Denver??? The Cavs beat the Spurs twice this season and match up well with them. Counting out Lebron in the playoffs is foolish and has proven to be in every series he's ever played in. Stop hating. on May 31st 2007 by Akron P 4. A Kobe statue peeing on someone? Apparently he DOES shoot it that high. on May 31st 2007 by Joel O's 5. Well, if Denver got AI, there's no reason to think that Kobe might end up on a team with another superstar already... on May 31st 2007 by Joel O's 6. How is it that the Kobe trade demand was the big news yesterday? His team didn't win. He's part of the team. Notice how he failed to take any responsibility for that loss. Should he not have waited until his sport's biggest event be completed before becoming the media hog? The media's need to jump all over it detracted from far more newsworthy events such as the Spurs winning the Western Conference Championship. What an insult to the Spurs, the Warriors, and their fans. Yesterday, Venus Williams broke the record for the fastest serve by a woman and the Ducks won game 2 of the Stanley Cup. Those acts and other acts of athletic greatness were cast aside because some guy is whining again? Who cares if he wants to be traded? Making his tirade the sporting world's main focus resulted in the teams and individuals deserving of the attention having to take a backseat.

In fact, he didn't even get out of the fifth inning, looking shaky for the second consecutive game. Weaver started the game by getting the first two batters out, but then walked Raul Ibanez and put him on second with a wild pitch, where he was able to come around and score on Jose Guillen's shallow single, giving the Mariners a 1-0 lead. "I think my command just wasn't there," Weaver said. In the bottom of the inning the Angels bats exploded for four runs off of Seattle's young flamethrower, Felix Hernandez. The big blows coming off the bats of Gary Matthews Jr. and Casey Kotchman, who went deep back-to-back, with Matthews' blast accounting for three runs. Usually, giving Weaver four runs is like putting money in the bank, but that was not to be. "Obviously anytime you get a four-spot off of a guy like that, you want to capitalize off of it," said Weaver, annoyed at not getting the job done, but happy that the team won. Kenji Johjima and Adrian Beltre started off the second with singles, quickly putting Weaver in a hole, but he was able to get the next three batters out. When he retired the next three batters in the third it looked as if Weaver was going to pitch one of his regular games. In 27 pervious Major League starts, Weaver was 15-5 with an ERA of 2.86, and only once this season had he surrendered more than three earned runs. "Every pitcher, no matter how good they are, is going to struggle at times," said manager Mike Scioscia. With Hernandez also putting up two scoreless innings, it looked as if the two future stars were in complete command. However, when Weaver went to the mound to start the fourth, the wheels began to come off. Ben Broussard led off with a walk, followed by another Johjima single and a walk to Yuniesky Betancourt to load the bases. Singles by Jose Lopez and Ichiro Suzuki made the score 4-3 before Weaver could retire the side. "He really wasn't getting through his pitches the way he usually does, and I think it affected his command a little," said Scioscia. After Hernandez retired the Angels in order in the fourth, Weaver returned to mound, but didn't fare much better as Broussard hit a two-out double. And after Weaver finally got Johjima out, Beltre doubled home Broussard and scored himself on a single by Betancourt, ending Weaver's night. "I just couldn't make my pitches," Weaver said. The nine hits were the most he has allowed in a game this season and the 4 2/3 innings constituted his second shortest outing. "I was struggling with my fastball command, but my offspeed felt great," Weaver said. And while the outcome was not one of his better efforts, he didn't think he was as bad as the scoreboard indicated. "I put a couple of balls over the plate," he said, adding that "there were a few seeing-eye ground balls, which is unusual for me because I'm not a ground-ball pitcher, and then a few bloopers there at the end." Not the type of outing that Angel fans have become expecting to see from Weaver, and definitely not the marquee matchup that the game had been billed as, as Hernandez also had a tough night. Behind 5-4, Vladimir Guerrero put the Angels back on top in the bottom of the inning with a three-run homer. From that point, behind another strong effort by the bullpen, the Angels held on for the victory. "Everyone kind of built it up," said Weaver of his matchup with Hernandez. "But both clubs came out swinging and obviously both of us didn't go as deep as we would have wanted to." is a contributor to MLB.com.

Early yesterday afternoon, a few of the Pirates' players gathered around the clubhouse's mammoth television, checking out the Milwaukee-Atlanta matinee. Pirates starter Paul Maholm pitched 7 innings last night, giving up four runs on six hits against the Padres.. Click photo for larger image. Pirates Notebook: GM says money will not decide top pick Pirates Q&A with Dejan Kovacevic (RHP Shawn Chacon 1-0, 3.38) vs. San Diego Padres (RHP Greg Maddux 4-3, 4.20), 7:05 p.m., PNC Park. Maddux can still look like Maddux at times, but the Pirates have three players with encouraging histories against him: Freddy Sanchez is 6 for 11, Jason Bay 9 for 24 with two home runs and Jack Wilson 12 for 35. The Pirates are 3-27 when the opponent has more hits. Yes, scoreboard watching in Pittsburgh. And when the Braves pulled ahead, the room roared. "Being in second place feels pretty good," shortstop Jack Wilson said shortly thereafter. "We're here watching the Brewers, the only team ahead of us, and I'm checking out what the Cubs are doing. It's a change. It's the first time I've watched other games with any real enthusiasm, and I've been here seven years." Well, the Pirates remain second in the seedy Central Division for a second day, but Chris Young and the San Diego Padres dumped a bucket of cold water on any warm-and-fuzzy sentiment with a 9-0 annihilation last night at PNC Park. Young pitched seven scoreless innings to outlast a nearly-as-efficient Paul Maholm, Khalil Greene gave him a grand slam of support and, as a whole, the Padres performed very much like the legitimate contender they are. Suffice it to say there are miles to go before being 5 1/2 games behind the Brewers matters much. "It's going to take consistency," first baseman Adam LaRoche said after his 0 for 4 with three strikeouts cooled an 8-for-17 tear. "And that's not just consistency in winning. It's consistent pitching, consistent at-bats, good defense. If we're not doing all of that, we're not going to win a lot of series, and where we are in the standings won't matter much." "Tonight, we got beat. That's a pretty good team over there." Led, on this night, by a pretty good pitcher. Young once again dominated the Pirates, improving to 3-0 with a 0.76 ERA against the team that drafted him in 2000, then traded him for reliever Matt Herges two years later. He held them to four hits, struck out seven, and even his lone walk -- to the Pirates' hottest hitter, Jason Bay, in the seventh inning -- looked deliberate. "It's the third time we've seen Chris Young, and we haven't been able to do much with him," manager Jim Tracy said. "There's something we're obviously not seeing." There might be a reason: Young tends to start off opponents with a low fastball, taking advantage of his 6-foot-10 stature for extra downward plane, as well as a peculiarly late release point. From there, he gradually works up the ladder in the strike zone, going higher and higher with each pitch while staying with the fastball. To the batter, by all accounts, the pitches look the same. And, given that Young seldom tops 90 mph, the temptation often is too great, and the batter hacks underneath. The Pirates discussed all of the above beforehand, to no avail: Young threw 60 of 86 pitches for strikes, including a remarkable 23 that were fouled off. As LaRoche put it, "He's the only guy in the league who can get away with throwing a fastball right down the middle." "There's a deception factor there, for right-handed hitters especially," Tracy said. "We hit two balls on the screws all night." Young, now 6-3 with a 2.42 ERA, shrugged at any suggestion he might have done something special. "My fastball and command are my bread and butter," he said. "And my mechanics are pretty good right now." And his spell on the Pirates? "I'm confident every time I go out there." Maholm nearly was a match for Young, pitching into the eighth inning with San Diego ahead 2-0 on manufactured runs in the third and fifth innings. He got the first two outs of the eighth, too, and had one aboard when Jonah Bayliss replaced him and brought the rout. He issued an intentional walk, then an unintentional one to load the bases, and Greene cleared them with a drive off the top of the center-field wall that made it 7-0. Josh Sharpless gave up two more in the ninth. For Maholm, charged with four runs on six hits in his 7 innings, it was a second consecutive solid showing and another encouraging sign for the Pirates that their rotation could be deeper than just Tom Gorzelanny and Ian Snell this summer. "Paul did fine," Tracy said. "He deserved better than he got." Maholm credited a rediscovered aggressiveness early in counts. "I'm coming hard into the zone early on. If they hit it, they hit it," he said. "You do that early, then expand your strike zone and make them hit your pitch." For the right-handed relievers, though, it was more disappointment, which hardly is a surprise anymore. Salomon Torres and Matt Capps aside, the Pirates have had mostly poor bullpen work from the right side, already having discarded John Wasdin, Marty McLeary and Brian Rogers, as well as losing Shawn Chacon to the rotation. "We obviously didn't pitch very well at all, other than Damaso Marte, after Paul was out," Tracy said, referring to his lone left-handed reliever on the night.

Piniella and team executives held a long meeting of their own before Wednesday night's game against Florida. ''Everybody's on the same page,'' Piniella said. ''It has been a little bit frustrating. But everybody's on the same page and we just go forward.'' Going forward may mean settling on a lineup. The Cubs have platoons in centre and right field and at shortstop. ''I've tried my darnedest to play everybody,'' Piniella said. ''It's getting to the point where we're going to have to get really set. I can't do it at every position. .. But just play the people who are getting the job done the best.'' The Cubs had lost seven of nine and were third in the NL Central at 22-28 after Tuesday's 9-4 defeat - certainly not the start they expected after hiring Piniella and committing about US$300 million to lure and retain players in the off-season. They're showing the same fundamental breakdowns that plagued them the past few years under former manager Dusty Baker, and there were several on Tuesday. Piniella bemoaned mistakes on the bases during his pre-game session with reporters, then watched commit two in the second inning. DeRosa got thrown out at third trying to advance from second on a grounder to short, and Barrett got picked off second. On Wednesday, reporters were not allowed into the clubhouse until about 4:15 p.m. - about 45 minutes later than normal - as players tried to figure out how to escape this funk. ''We have too good a team to be in the situation we are,'' first baseman said they're pressing - himself and Lee included. ''We've got to go out there and believe,'' Floyd said. ''If you put pressure on yourself, nothing's going to (go) right.'' Piniella said the idea for the players meeting was Lee's and that the session with management was just something they hold ''about once a month.''

Dodgers 5, Nationals 0 WASHINGTON (AP) -Derek Lowe did a little bit of everything for the Dodgers. Lowe pitched seven scoreless innings, reached base three times and scored a run to help Los Angeles shut out the Washington Nationals for the second straight game, 5-0 on Wednesday night. Lowe (5-5) gave up three hits, struck out five and walked two while allowing only one batter past first base. He combined with relievers Jim Beimel and Rudy Seanez on a four-hitter. ''The final line score looked good, but it was a struggle,'' Lowe said. ''The outs weren't coming easy. Early in the game, the stuff wasn't there, so you kind of have to grind it out.'' Lowe said it took some time to find his stuff, but that he felt more comfortable after the first few innings. He retired nine if a row at one point from the third through the sixth innings. ''As the game went on, it seemed like I got a little bit better,'' Lowe said. ''Today was just a day where I was fortunate to make one good pitch per at-bat.'' Washington manager Manny Acta didn't seem to think Lowe had very much trouble. ''He's pretty tough,'' Acta said. ''He's got to be off his game for you to do any damage and he wasn't.'' Lowe also helped at the plate. He entered the game with a .105 batting average but singled once, walked twice and scored a run, reaching base in all three plate appearances. The Dodgers haven't given Lowe much support at times this season, scoring three runs or less in five of his first 11 starts. But two of Lowe's at-bats led to runs. ''I tell you what, Derek was good at the plate, too,'' Los Angeles manager Grady Little said. ''He had a couple of big walks, a base hit that contributed to some of the run scoring. It was good to see him come away from there with a win. Maybe that will get him off onto a roll.'' Los Angeles opened the three-game series Tuesday with a 10-0 victory and got help from starting pitcher Brad Penny at the plate in that contest. He went 2-for-2, and the Dodger starters are 3-for-3 with two walks and a sacrifice in the first two games. Lowe took care of the first seven innings, and Beimel worked the eighth and Seanez pitched the ninth. Nationals starter Mike Bacsik (1-1) allowed six hits and four runs - two earned - in six innings. The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the fifth. Luis Gonzalez led off with a double and moved up when Russell Martin grounded out. Andre Ethier lined an RBI double and after Lowe walked, Rafael Furcal singled home a run. Martin hit a two-run homer in the sixth for a 4-0 lead. The Dodgers got a break when Nationals shortstop Cristian Guzman misplayed Jeff Kent's one-out grounder, and Martin's two-out homer gave Los Angeles a pair of unearned runs. ''I think pitching has been holding us together this year,'' Martin said. ''(But) hitting's going to come along. We've got some guys that hit for a lot of years, and we've got some young guys who can do it, too.'' Lowe got a one-out walk in the fifth against reliever Ray King and later scored on Nomar Garciaparra's infield single for a 5-0 lead. The Nationals' recent offensive problems continued as they didn't even threaten. They last scored a run in the eighth inning Sunday in a loss in St. Louis. This was the first time the Nationals have been shut out in consecutive games since May 16-17, 2006, against the Chicago Cubs. Notes: Furcal has a 15-game hitting streak, tying his career best. ... Los Angeles improved to a season-best 10 games over .500. ... The Nationals are just 7-18 against teams outside the NL East. They are 14-14 against the NL East.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/5-5&fd=R&url=http://dodgers.scout.com/2/647904.html&cid=1116778987&ei=m-xeRubsBY2G0gGY99jYDQ Scout.com: Lowe Handles Nats With Ease Lowe Handles Nats With Ease Martin congratulated on home run Posted May 31, 2007 Derek Lowe (5-5), hopefully slipping into his second-half mode, didn't have his best command but that would be hard to sell to the Nationals after he allowed them only three hits over seven innings and Los Angeles ran their record in the nation' capital to 2-0 over 18 innings, allowing nine hits and outscoring the hosts 15-0. It was the third consecutive game the Dodger starter didn't allow a run as Randy Wolf, Brad Penny and Lowe have surrendered only 12 hits in 19.1 innings resulting in three winning efforts. The trio has recorded a 4-0 record over their last two starts and have allowed three runs in 39.1 innings. By his own admission he had trouble getting into sync early in the game and although Washington didn't hit him much or score at all, he burned up a hat-full of pitches attempting to find his way back. My line score looked good, but it didn't tell the story," Lowe said after the game. "I was behind in the count early, and you're not going to win many games like that. In the third, fourth and fifth innings, I don't think I threw three breaking balls for strikes." " But when the motor started to smooth out, when his breaking ball started the "falling off the table" mode, it was just a case of how many innings Manager Grady Little would let him go. He picked up 11 ground ball outs and retired 13 of the final 15 he faced, allowing them one hit. The hit, incidentally, came via a very charitable scoring call, the obvious error bouncing out of Tony Abreu's glove, off his chest and into his hands before he made a late throw to first. After his usual early-season shakedown, he seemingly has all the belts and pulleys in working order. Last season he was 7-5, 3.88 before the All-Star break and 11-5, 3.63 after. Lowe has crafted a 2.16 ERA in six May starts, winning in four of them. And oddly enough, he's lost the two complete games he's pitched. Lowe's record is very deceptive. In his five losses, the Dodgers have scored only seven runs and in his five wins, he's allowed only six earned runs. He has eight quality starts in 12 outings and his ERA is down to 3.32. He's allowed only two home runs compared to 14 last year. The offense also seemed to take a while, finally getting on the board with a little help from the Washington infield. An error and doubles by Luis Gonzalez and Andre Ethier, plus 's single, made it 2-0 in the fifth. The hit boosted Furcal to a career-tying 15 straight games. A two-run home run to dead center by (#5) to boost the margin to 4-0 and a Lowe walk, a Furcal double and a Nomar Garciaparra single drove in the final run of the game in the seventh. Joe Beimel allowing the Nationals nothing at all in the eighth and Rudy Seanez gave up a harmless single in the ninth before closing things out. With the win, the Dodgers will win the series for the first in three tries in JFK Stadium, playing their final game tonight with their new stadium scheduled to be ready in 2008. The Dodgers jump a remarkable 10 games above .500 for the first time this season but can't shake either Arizona (- 1/2) or San Diego (-1) in the National League West. Washington can't even retire the Dodger starters. Lowe reached base in all three of his plate appearances on a single and two walks and after Penny's 2-for-2 performance the previous night, they've reached base five straight times. "There's a lot of pressure on Mark tomorrow. Hopefully he can get his first hit of the year," Lowe said, tongue firmly in cheek, of tonight's starter Mark Hendrickson. Mark Hendrickson (2-2) draws the final start of the series tonight.

Lou Piniella didn't need many words to sum up what he saw in the Florida Marlins' 9-4 victory over his slumping Cubs on Tuesday night at Wrigley Field in Chicago. "That might be our worst game of the year," said Piniella. The Cubs have lost seven of their past nine games. Piniella spoke to the media before the game about his team's bad baserunning. Then the Cubs made two blunders on the base paths. Mark DeRosa was thrown out at third base trying to advance from second on a grounder to shortstop, and Michael Barrett was picked off at second &#8212; both in the second inning. "Not a good play," Piniella said on DeRosa's choice to go to third. "Getting picked off second base, not a good play. "We just have to keep playing and turn this thing around," Piniella said. "Nobody is going to feel sorry for us. All these other teams don't [care] if we're struggling or not struggling. "We have to keep working at it &#8212; and we will. The word 'patience' is a beautiful word. You need a lot of patience. The problem is that in this business, patience is [needed] every night." The Cubs are six games below .500, tied for their season worst. LHP Randy Johnson (2-2) will make his first start in 10 days today. The Big Unit missed his last turn with forearm tendinitis. 3B Chipper Jones (sore right hand) won't play until Friday at the earliest, manager Bobby Cox said. OF Ryan Freel was released from a hospital and placed on the 15-day disabled list. OF Dewayne Wise was called up from AAA Louisville. Freel was hurt in an outfield collision Monday. SS Troy Tulowitzki leads major-league rookies in runs, hits and walks. 2B Craig Biggio's 651st double was his 2,973rd career hit. He ranks seventh in career doubles, six behind Nap Lajoie. SS Rafael Furcal extended his hitting streak to 14 games. OF Shawn Green went on the 15-day DL with a broken right foot, the first time he's been on the DL in the major leagues. 1B Ryan Howard, who recently came off the DL, scared Phillies fans when he came up limping and left in the ninth inning against Arizona. It was cramps. "My leg is fine," said last year's NL MVP. Back spasms kept SS David Eckstein out of the lineup for the third straight game. Reliever Kevin Cameron allowed a run to the Pirates, the first he has given up in 17-1/3 career innings. As expected, OF Barry Bonds didn't start. The Giants were off Monday, and manager Bruce Bochy likes the idea of getting Bonds two straight days of rest. 1B Nick Johnson, who had hoped to rejoin the Nationals by June 1, said rehabilitation of his broken right leg is taking longer than he expected and he can't predict when he'll return.

Thursday, May 31, 2007 Letters to the Editor View & Buy Photos Posted: Tuesday, May 29, 2007 - 02:06:28 pm CDT Francis quiets Cardinals as Rockies extend streak to six straight victories Colorado Rockies' Kazuo Matsui (7) covers his head as he beats the throw to St. Louis Cardinals third baseman Scott Spiezio (26) during the fifth inning of a baseball game in Denver on Monday. (AP Photo/Jack Dempsey) DENVER (AP) &#045; Jeff Francis doesn&#039;t want to analyze why he&#039;s pitching so well in May. The Colorado Rockies feel the same way about their six-game winning streak. Francis allowed five hits in 72/3 innings as the Rockies continued on their longest winning streak since 2002 with a 6-2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Monday. &#8220I think we&#039;ve always expected this out of ourselves,&#8221; said Francis, who is 3-1 with a 2.23 ERA in May. &#8220Nobody motivates us more than ourselves. We&#039;re not out here winning so they&#039;re not writing bad things about us.&#8221; The Rockies had come under fire before their hot streak. Not that manager Clint Hurdle has paid any attention to the criticism. &#8220I don&#039;t read the papers,&#8221; Hurdle said. &#8220I&#039;ve heard rumblings. But you talk about staying focused on the game at hand.&#8221; Francis (4-4) can&#039;t explain why the Rockies have broken out of their funk, only saying the team has started combining their pitching and hitting. &#8220Since I&#039;ve been here, the biggest problem has been putting it together for a stretch,&#8221; Francis said. &#8220It&#039;s what we&#039;ve expected. We&#039;re not satisfied at six.&#8221; Francis had a shutout going into the eighth when Aaron Miles doubled with two outs and So Taguchi hit a two-run homer to left, his first of the season. It was Francis&#039; only mistake of the game. &#8220He did what he does with pitches like that,&#8221; Francis said. Miles was impressed with his former teammate. &#8220Everybody has the book on him and everybody has the tape,&#8221; Miles said. &#8220When he&#039;s pitching where he wants to, he&#039;s really tough. It&#039;s why he fast-forwarded through the minor leagues &#045; nobody could hit him there. &#8220He had a little bit of trouble in the beginning of his career here, but it looks like he&#039;s settling into a pretty good pitcher.&#8221; Hurdle pulled Francis after Taguchi&#039;s homer, feeling Francis didn&#039;t have anything left, even after only 99 pitches. &#8220I was pretty exhausted,&#8221; said Francis, who threw 14 scoreless innings before Taguchi&#039;s homer. &#8220I could feel the end coming out there.&#8221; Brad Hawpe had a two-run homer in the seventh and Matt Holliday had a solo homer in the first, his ninth. Kaz Matsui scored two runs on two singles and Willy Taveras finished 2-for-4 with two stolen bases. &#8220I think we&#039;re expecting to come up with the big plays in big situations,&#8221; Holliday said. &#8220We&#039;re having fun.&#8221; The Cardinals continue their road woes, having dropped 11 of their last 13 away from Busch Stadium. &#8220This game, we never really got it going,&#8221; Miles said. Francis worked his way out of a two-out jam in the sixth. He gave up singles to Miles and Taguchi and then pitched around Albert Pujols to load the bases. Scott Spiezio hit into an inning-ending force play at second. &#8220We made a lot of outs that were not quality outs,&#8221; manager Tony La Russa said. &#8220That&#039;s how I see today&#039;s game.&#8221; The Rockies see it as another step in the right direction. The team hasn&#039;t won seven games in a row since September 1998. Kip Wells (2-9) gave up 11 hits in 61/3 innings and struck out three. The Cardinals have been outscored 51-15 in his last seven starts. &#8220It was a battle the whole time,&#8221; Wells said of his outing. &#8220Obviously I had men on base pretty much every inning.&#8221; Pujols&#039; 11-game hitting streak was snapped with an 0-for-3 afternoon. Francis sparked a two-run fifth inning with a one-out double to right-center, his first extra base hit since 2005. He scored on Matsui&#039;s RBI single to left. When asked about his speed around third, Francis just rolled his eyes. &#8220Yeah, right,&#8221; he said. As for his recent success on the mound, he doesn&#039;t want to dwell on it. &#8220I&#039;ve always felt like I could go out here and win a ball game,&#8221; Francis said. &#8220Even if I&#039;m in a slump, I have confidence I&#039;m going to come out of it. When I&#039;m pitching well, like now, it&#039;s easy to roll with it.&#8221; Notes: Reliever Manny Corpas left town to attend a funeral in Panama. He&#039;s expected back Wednesday. ... David Eckstein and Scott Rolen got Monday off to heal. Eckstein missed his second straight game with tightness in his back. Rolen suffered a slight concussion Sunday when he collided with Washington&#039;s Dmitri Young at first base. All Contents Copyright &copy; 2007 News Tribune Co. All rights reserved.

You are, after all, the game that means so much to so many. I have to admit, though, it's hard to see you this way, but you don't have any reason to shy off in shame. Yes, ratings are down and people seem to be losing interest in your incarnation as the Western Conference Finals, but they just don't know what they're missing out on. It was another great game on Monday night, a heavyweight battle with both teams delivering their shots and absorbing their opponent's best until the Jazz simply couldn't take anymore. The Spurs stood victorious, winning 91 to 79 and taking a commanding 3 - 1 lead in the series. Keep your chin up, though, because they'll come around to seeing it the way I do eventually. All this means is that people don't really know who you are and maybe they're not sure why they fell in love with you in the first place. Don't believe the critics that say you aren't deep enough because those are the people that have been enticed by the shallow flashiness that too many people exhibit through you. All those attention-grabbing dunks and long-range shots are a part of who you are, but I think we both know that there's so much more to you than that. Just remember that what makes you so beautiful is your complexity combined with your intrinsic ability to synthesize such scrupulous minutiae into the game we see before our eyes. I think I know why people have slipped away from you lately, though. There aren't as many of those superstars that the NBA built itself upon left in your annual tournament and the high-octane, frenetically-paced teams have been eliminated, taking the perceived fun out of the postseason. I can see the distraction of a set of ping pong balls that will shape the future. I understand that star players making demands for change because of their team's elimination is what makes headlines. I can see that the slower pace and more physical nature of the games have a difficult time competing against the knockout right hand from Quinton "Rampage" Jackson. But the same game that people are seeing as "boring" now is the one I've been devoted to since I was eight years old. Beneath all the glitz, glamour, and offensive gimmickry lies a primed surface waiting to be appreciated before being painted upon. It was that plain grey canvas that first fueled my adoration and now holds me tightly bound to you still. It all started with understanding that you were the simplest of games, needing nothing more than a bouncing ball and preferably a pair of rubber-soled high-tops. Those weren't always available, so dudes rocking their Airwalks or church shoes would step to your court because it didn't really matter. It was all about the ball - we didn't need bats or pads or cleats or cups. All we brought to the court was our own skill and desire. Everyone learned to do everything on that court because that's what you demanded of us. You're not like those other games that require players to take up a certain responsibility and stick to that. With you, we had to learn how to pass, shoot, dribble, rebound .. we had to do it all on those blacktops. You forced no one into any kind of chore at that time like football did, where you either pass, throw, carry, or block. Everyone undertook a broad range of tasks, everyone learned the essentials, and everyone had to be respectable in each area to have any success. And as we learned how to play your game, we began to invent. People had always been inventing things throughout the course of human history, either with the purpose of improving an aspect of their lives or just stumbling upon something accidentally that had that same effect. But you were born in an age where invention became rapid because it was a deliberate pursuit, a time when a guy in Massachusetts was bored and wanted to find a way to pass his days. There was a problem and Naismith solved it by inventing you, just as The Wizard of Menlo Park was fulfilling pre-existing needs in New Jersey. Similar to the fashion you were invented with the purpose of improvement, we all used our creativity and imagination to invent the moves and stylistic dribbles that we felt would improve our game. We looked towards our idols on television and replicated their actions while adding our own spin to it, hoping that we'd establish our own signature on the game. We used whatever acrobatic ability we had to figure out how to dupe our defenders and win those meaningless games on the blacktop. Then things changed - suddenly we were playing games on hardwood courts inside of the high school gym on Sunday mornings. Now the disputes that we had about the score were settled quickly by looking at the digital scoreboard. Referees started calling these things called and we had to learn a more organized game with some guy we called Now, more than ever, there was a need for coordination between us and our teammates. You demanded it from us because when we failed to be on the same page as our team, you'd give the win to our opposition and we were forced to bitterly go home, riding in the backseat of our father's car as he tried to cheer us up and we sipped our juiceboxes. Boy, did you teach us the importance of being a team. We had to learn that the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. We realized that to play your game and have the optimal effect of the skills we honed earlier, we had to harmonize our actions like an group does their voices. Coach had to teach us how to work as a unit on the fly because there weren't pauses in the game for us to huddle up and set things up. You became a game of vertical management with our coach at the pinnacle in practice, but horizontal coordination reigned supreme during games when we each served as units working with one another, independent of our superior until time outs and breaks. Those lessons in spontaneous coordination, more commonly known as stick with me today. The chemistry of teamwork is what makes you so damn beautiful and nothing can ever change that. Because you flow like a river - continuously, with no significant stoppages or necessary switches of the field from offense to defense - we were forced to make decisions under pressure and in the moment. Our coaches could call plays all they wanted from the sidelines, but the in-game execution was on us, serving as a manifestation of hours of preparation through drills for skill development. All our coach could do was cultivate an environment that favored what he hoped would become a natural synchronization on our team. Which brings us all the way back to where we are today, watching the conclusion of Game Four between the San Antonio Spurs and Utah Jazz come to an end with Gregg Popovich forced to pry Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili away from reporters as debris rained from the stands. All these two teams have been doing for a week now has been playing fundamental, pure team basketball - artistry in motion in paying tribute to you on the premier hardwood courts of San Antonio and Salt Lake City. Duncan's angled bank shots are brushstroked lines, the utilization of the most fundamental skill in the game, adding only to his greatness with his humility in using them. Pick-and-rolls between Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer exemplify the colorful chemistry you encourage. The plays drawn up by Popovich and Jerry Sloan on those whiteboards during timeouts provide the shape of the offensive and defensive schematics for both teams that foster necessary organization. Tony Parker's fearlessness when driving to the basket, contorting his form in the lack of space between the forest of big men in the paint, epitomize the creativity and athleticism you demand. And lest we forget the sheer physicality that is leaving these competitors bruised and battered, adding texture to their skin in the form of scars, scrapes and cuts; Ginobili looks more like he played a game in Anaheim on Monday night instead of Salt Lake City. I know that it must pain you to see people not responding positively to the way the game is being played by these two teams, especially when you consider that this is the way you want the game played. The Jazz and Spurs have fully embraced their coaches' preaching the " ore" gospel, as so many different players have the ability to contribute to the ultimate goal of winning on any given night. They believe in one another, don't put pressure on themselves, and have each other's back in the same manner as team's of yore. So really, I don't see what's so boring about the product we see on the court. With the synthesis of all that minutiae and what not. I don't have any answers for you or reasons for why it is this way, but I hope you feel better in knowing that at least there are some people out there who still love you for you and not the bastardized version that we're fed all too often. I guess, with things being the way they are right now, people have just forgotten what they should be looking for. I promise I'll do my best to remind them.

They've been ''choking.'' Some admit they might be pressing to try to justify the $300 million expectations created by the Cubs' big-spending winter. So after a game Tuesday night that manager Lou Piniella said ''might be the worst game of the year,'' team leader Derrek Lee scheduled the first players-only meeting of the season for Wednesday afternoon. The 'O' is for offense Why did they need a meeting? ''That's kind of obvious,'' Lee said. It might take a while to find out whether the meeting did any good, especially considering the immediate result was another lopsided loss to the Florida Marlins. ''We just cleared the air and said some things,'' said Cliff Floyd, one of several players who called the meeting constructive. The Cubs have lost four straight, eight of 10 and 14 of their last 20 as they head into a welcome day off today. ''We just need to turn it around. We've got too good of a team,'' Lee said. ''We want to win bad in here. Sometimes you just have to step back and let things happen. Sometimes you can try too hard.'' The Cubs may have hit bottom in that area Tuesday night. Floyd admitted that with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth inning, trailing by five, he swung as hard as he could on every pitch and consequently struck out -- knowing that even with a grand slam, the Cubs still would have trailed. Lee followed with a similar at-bat and strikeout to end the game. With the loss Wednesday, the Cubs sunk to a season-worst seven games under .500. When you look at a record like that, ''You start choking a little bit,'' Floyd said. ''You start not feeling good about yourself. And if we didn't have a good team, I wouldn't even be talking to you all right now. I'd tell you to move on. ''But we've got a good team. We've just got to breathe and let it show and let it go and believe in ourselves when we go out there on the field.'' Aramis Ramirez said some players might be pressing under the weight of the expectations from all the changes and money spent in the offseason. But Mark DeRosa said: ''We knew the expectations coming in from Day 1 of spring training. You could sense the fans want it, the city wants it, the coaches want it -- we want it more than anyone. ''It's just a matter of getting back to playing good, fundamental baseball -- everyone, including myself -- and not doing just juvenile stuff out there.'' He was referring to mental mistakes, especially recently, including his brain-lock play Tuesday in which he was thrown out easily at third base trying to advance on a grounder to short. ''The talent is just overflowing in the clubhouse. It's ridiculous,'' DeRosa said. ''There's no reason this should be going on.'' The worst part might be the one-run losses. The Cubs are a major-league-worst 2-12 in one-run games. ''That starts to eat at you mentally, and guys start trying to do too much,'' DeRosa said. ''We just need to relax and realize the only way we're going to correct this thing is for everyone to come together as a team and relax and just have some fun.'' Whether the meeting suggested some players taking on leadership responsibilities that appeared to be lacking, Ramirez said: ''I don't think you need a leader. You need players to go out there and play the game and have fun and don't worry about a lot of stuff that some people are talking about. We've got the talent. We've just got to get it done.'' What's the likelihood the meeting has an effect? ''I would say they're 50-50 in my experience,'' Lee said. ''So we'll see what happens.''

Marc Iavaroni is now a rival coach in the Western Conference, set to be announced as the newest head coach of the Memphis Grizzlies on Thursday afternoon. As outlines on his bio sheet, Iavaroni just completed for his fifth season for the Suns, including the last three and a half as the lead assistant. Previously, he served as assistant coach/director of player development under Miami President/Head Coach Pat Riley from 1999-02. Iavaroni’s responsibilities consisted of all general duties of an assistant coach plus the direct responsibility of developing Heat players year round. Prior to that, he was an assistant coach under Cleveland Head Coach Mike Fratello for two seasons (1997-99), concentrating his efforts on big man development. Iavaroni, who recently assisted the USA Basketball Men’s Senior National Team in training camp as they prepared for the 2006 FIBA Men’s World Championships in Japan, owes much of his teaching expertise to his 22-year association as a student and instructor under Hall of Fame coach Pete Newell. A seven-year NBA veteran from 1982-1989, Iavaroni played for Philadelphia, San Antonio and Utah. He was a starter as a rookie on the 76ers’ 1983 World Championship team, voted one of the 10 best NBA teams of all-time. In 1984-85, he played for San Antonio and then-head coach Cotton Fitzsimmons before completing his final three seasons with the Jazz, who won the Midwest Division in 1989. Iavaroni concluded his professional career alongside current Suns Head Coach Mike D’Antoni in Milan before retiring in 1991. Iavaroni played professional overseas for five seasons in Italy and Spain, including three seasons after his college career and two seasons following his NBA career. His coaching career began as a graduate assistant coach at his alma mater, University of Virginia, helping the Cavaliers to their first Final Four team in 1981. Following his professional playing career, Iavaroni was an assistant coach at Bowling Green State for two seasons from 1992-94 under Jim Larranaga, who recently took George Mason to the 2006 Final Four. As a collegian, Iavaroni was a four-year starter and finished in 1978 ranked in Virginia’s top 10 in career scoring and rebounding. He gained first team All-Tournament honors on Virginia’s 1976 ACC Tournament championship team, an accomplishment he still considers among his most satisfying playing achievements. Iavaroni has a penchant for defense, especially with regard to big men, a position he played with the Jazz, Suns and Spurs. The move to choose Iavaroni should ease Pau Gasol's trade demands, while also fueling speculation that socks and suits won't be the only luggage Iavaroni takes along. Phoenix Vice President of Basketball Operations David Griffin longs to be an NBA general manager and his name has already been linked with opportunities in Memphis and Seattle, to name a few. Though it might be in Phoenix's best interest to remove one of D'Antoni's hats and give the GM job in Phoenix solely to Griffin, the opportunity to build something out of nothing might hold more appeal than simply keeping tabs and mildly tinkering with a solid roster already in place. Irregardless, Iavaroni has been deserving for quite some time and should make the Grizzlies a much better contender in the long run as long as he can keep the core of Gasol, Rudy Gay and Kyle Lowry together and rely on Jerry West's knowledge in next month's draft to craft a winner. Memphis had the chance to nab the top pick in the draft. Instead, the balls bounced the way of Portland, Seattle and Atlanta instead. Still, Memphis has the No. 4 pick, where they could go big with Chinese center Yi Jianlian (who was in Phoenix for Game Five of the Spurs - Suns playoff series) or replace Stromile Swift with Florida's Joakim Noah or Damon Stoudamire with Mike Conley, Jr. Barring trade, the fourth selection is the only pick Memphis has in the draft, so Iavaroni will be tested early on. Nonetheless, Iavaroni will bring Memphis fans excitement and competition ... something they haven't seen since Hubie Brown left the sideline.

Look for that 95-mph fastball on both sides of the plate, guard against a biting curveball and hope you hit something. There was no mystery last night, either, what with sinkerballer Derek Lowe throwing for the Dodgers, a right-hander whose sole objective is to get hitters to whack the ball into the ground, creating easy out after easy out, a demoralizing proposition for an entire lineup. Washington's Cristian Guzman makes an error on a ball hit by Jeff Kent in the sixth inning. The Dodgers scored two unearned runs in the inning; that's more scoring than the Nationals have done in two games in the series. (Jonathan Newton - The Washington Post) as the Dodgers continue to work over the Nats with a 5-0 win Wednesday night. Pitcher Shawn Hill, already on the DL for his left shoulder, will now need a second opinion on his right elbow. Right-hander Joel Hanrahan of Class AAA Columbus could be called up to start this weekend. Box score: Dodgers 5, Nationals 0 will visit renowned orthopedist James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala., on Monday to check on his right rotator cuff, which put him on the disabled list May 8. "I'm still not feeling good at all," Wagner said. Added GM Jim Bowden, "I think the fact that he hasn't made any progress is probably not a good sign." was back in the lineup -- and batting cleanup -- after sitting out Tuesday with back pain. moved from fourth to sixth. Errors for 3B Ryan Zimmerman, third-most among NL third basemen. Zimmerman had 15 errors last year. He's our best hitter right now. " -- Nationals Manager , on Dmitri Young. Barry Svrluga provides the Postgame audio from Barry Svrluga and video from Washington Post Live. A crowd of 40,389 pack into RFK Stadium to open up the 2007 baseball season. Manny Acta returns home. Check back daily and follow the progress of construction on the stadium. Save & Share Article The Nationals' sum total in those two evenings -- nine hits, no runs. Lowe dominated Washington in a 5-0 victory last night, allowing three singles in his seven innings, issuing the Nationals' second consecutive shutout to start a nine-game homestand. So repeat the refrain from 24 hours earlier, and roll out all those cliches. Good pitching beats good hitting, it wasn't our night, yada yada yada. It all resulted in a pair of games in which Penny and Lowe took what had been a rejuvenated Washington offense and flattened it. "You got to beat the best," Manager Manny Acta said. "We can't arrange the starting rotation when we're going to play opposite teams. Obviously, you want to miss both of them. But we didn't, they were on their game, and they beat us." The Nationals put just two men in scoring position in two nights. They are hitting .150 against the Dodgers. Yet they have a simple explanation: The pitchers were better. "We've just gotten beat these last two games," said right fielder Austin Kearns, who joined third baseman Ryan Zimmerman and center fielder Nook Logan in failing to get a hit the first two games of the series. "It's not like we've had our chances to win or anything. We just got beat. They hit better, they pitched better and played defense better. That's all there is to it." So much for an offensive revival, something that was widely hoped for when the Nationals hit .310 in winning five of seven games on their recent road trip. Last night's result followed a 10-0 loss to Penny on Tuesday; it was Washington's worst loss of the year. The last time the Nationals were shut out in consecutive games was last May 16-17, a pair of losses in Chicago against the Cubs. The only time it had happened at RFK since baseball returned here was in August 2005 against St. Louis. How bad have the past two nights been? At the plate, Lowe and Penny combined to go 3 for 3 with two walks, a double and a sacrifice bunt, more production than any of the Nationals' offensive regulars. Losing to those two, the anchors of the Dodgers' stellar staff, carries with it little shame. But what lies ahead makes the losses more daunting. San Diego ace Jake Peavy -- perhaps the National League's best pitcher thus far -- is due to open a three-game series here tomorrow night. Look, too, at the bigger picture in coming weeks. The Nationals travel to Minnesota next weekend, where ace lefty Johan Santana might await. They travel to Baltimore, where Erik Bedard is tough. They travel to Toronto, where Roy Halladay could be in the mix. Detroit and Justin Verlander, Cleveland and C.C. Sabathia, then back to Atlanta with John Smoltz and Tim Hudson. The rotations won't line up so they face all of those guys, but they'll see their share. Think they want to jump on Dodgers lefty Mark Hendrickson today? "We'll strap it on for him," left fielder Ryan Church said. "And then we got Peavy on Friday. But we're not overlooking tomorrow. It's going to be like that for this month. . . . We're going to see some good pitching." For the most part, they got that from their own lefty, Mike Bacsik, last night. The 29-year-old fill-in part for the Nationals' tattered rotation offered another serviceable performance, allowing four runs -- just two earned -- over his six innings. But even Bacsik, watching Lowe from the dugout, got the sense that the slightest error could make the difference. "It's human nature to know that the other team's throwing the ball good, so I got to keep this in reach," Bacsik said. Which he did through five innings, when he allowed a pair of doubles. The second, from right fielder Andre Ethier, put the Dodgers up 1-0. Then, Bacsik's first mistake: With two outs, he fell behind Lowe 3-0, then walked him on five pitches. Rafael Furcal followed with a run-scoring single that made it 2-0. Bacsik's only other mistake came an inning later, and it essentially took the Nationals out of the game. With one out, shortstop Cristian Guzman booted Jeff Kent's grounder. And with two down, Bacsik threw a 1-1 curveball inside to Dodgers catcher Russell Martin. "Pretty good pitch," Bacsik said, yet Martin clubbed it for a two-run homer that made it 4-0. That, then, was more than enough, and the Nationals filtered out of a quiet clubhouse knowing what they had just faced -- and what still lies ahead. "We have to capitalize at some point," Church said. "Good pitching, it's a test to see what you're made of."

Pizac) By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer SAN ANTONIO May 30, 2007 (AP) The Utah Jazz starting backcourt of Deron Williams and Derek Fisher could miss Game 5 of the Western Conference finals against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night. Williams has a sprained right foot. Fisher was in New York on Wednesday morning while his infant daughter underwent a procedure for a rare eye condition. He was expected to arrive in the afternoon, but any delay could prevent him from making the tip-off. The status of both players will be determined at game time. The likely replacements are Dee Brown, who has played only four minutes this series, and Gordan Giricek. "I can't count on anybody until we get in the building and they put their uniform on," Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. "If they can't, then we'll count on someone else. That's the way it's supposed to be." Missing either could be a stiff blow to the Jazz, who were trailing the series 3-1 and facing elimination. Williams is averaging a team-best 29.5 points and 9.3 assists this series. Fisher is averaging only 7.3 points per game and shooting 8-of-29, but he's averaging 38 minutes and is the team's most proven playoff performer. Brown is the third-string point guard, with Williams and Fisher the top two. So Brown would start only if Williams and Fisher are out. If either one is there, Giricek probably would start at shooting guard. Williams arrived at Utah's shoot-around Wednesday morning wearing a large walking boot protecting his injured foot not ankle, as the team reported Tuesday. He declined to be interviewed, except to say, "We'll see," when asked whether he expected to play. Williams also was a game-time decision for Game 4 because of a stomach ailment, but played 38 minutes and scored a team-best 27 points. Fisher's infant daughter Tatum is receiving treatment for her left eye. He left the team in the second round of the playoffs for an operation in New York, then returned to the team during the third quarter of Game 2 of a second-round series against Golden State. His dramatic arrival, and his five points in overtime, helped the Jazz win that game. Jazz's Williams, Fisher May Miss Game 5 Comment on This Story WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts.

http://www.fortwayne.com/mld/newssentinel/17304039.htm&cid News-Sentinel | 05/31/2007 | Cubs stay mum on team&#8217;s plan for lineup Tell us your story ideas Ask the Weather Expert Thursday, May 31, 2007 Posted on Thu, May. 31, 2007 Cubs stay mum on team&#8217;s plan for lineup of the Chicago Tribune CHICAGO &#8212; Two months into the season, Chicago Cubs manager Lou Piniella finally appears ready to go with a set lineup. What that lineup is or how long he will stick with it are questions only Piniella can answer, but after Wednesday night&#8217;s 9-0 loss to Florida, he wasn&#8217;t ready to divulge his master plan. &#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll draw the darn thing out of a hat,&#8221; Piniella said. After being swept by the Marlins, the Cubs dropped seven games below .500. With four straight losses and eight of their last 10, are players waiting for an eruption of Mount Lou? Asked beforehand if some players were playing themselves out of jobs, Piniella gave a cryptic response. &#8220;Look, I&#8217;ve tried &#8230; to play everybody, and give everybody opportunities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting to the point where we&#8217;re going to have to get really, really set.&#8221; Four players who may be getting fewer starts are shortstop Cesar Izturis, who&#8217;s hitting .194 with runners in scoring position, right fielder Matt Murton, who has eight RBIs, catcher Michael Barrett, who has made costly mental mistakes, and Jacque Jones, who has only one home run in 181 at-bats. Piniella said he won&#8217;t platoon certain players depending on whether a right-hander or left-hander is starting. &#8220;We&#8217;ve tried that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll try to get as set as we can, and I might have to tinker, or play different people, at one or two positions. I don&#8217;t know what else we can do We&#8217;re tried just about everything.&#8221; About the Real Cities Network Terms of Use & Privacy Statement

Either way, Charley Rosen says the Lakers have major issues, and they're not Kobe's fault."--> Posted: 15 hours ago The latest bulletin from Laker-Land is that Kobe Bryant wants to be traded &#151; and I, for one, don't blame him. Look at what's happened since Kobe and Shaq teamed up for the Lakers' last championship: Kobe wants out of town Rosen: Blame the Busses Blogjam: What's next for L.A.? Kobe has 'trust issues' Boards: Talk to Lakers fans Kriegel: The Kobe Rules Lakers owner in DUI trouble Shaq was traded because Jerry Buss didn't want to commit to a long-term, hugely expensive contract for an overweight player whose body was breaking down. On one hand, this is totally understandable. On the other hand, being able to compete at a championship level for another few seasons would easily have earned the organization a lot more money than first-round playoffs exits have done. In return for Shaq, the Lakers received Lamar Odom &#151; a notoriously soft player &#151; and a roster full of journeymen. Caron Butler, a semi-useful scorer, was then dealt to Washington for the perpetually disappointing Kwame Brown, who probably has the worst hands of any big man in the league. Phil Jackson was also given the boot, to be replaced by Rudy Tomjanovich, who was in ill-health, as well as being basically incompetent. Instead of going after the likes of Baron Davis and Ron Artest &#151; both of whom were available &#151; the Lakers broke the bank in signing Vladimir Radmanovich and re-signing Brian Cook, a pair of duds. Instead of providing Jackson with a capable point guard, Smush Parker was signed and then retained. So who's to blame for the rapid decline of the once-glorious Lakers' dynasty? 1. Jerry Buss, for giving Kobe and PJ contradictory versions of what the team's long- and short-terms plans were; for being less interested in the ruination of his team that in tooling around town in the company of hopeful starlets one-third his age; for trying to control team expenditures so that his personal life-style could be perpetuated; and, most importantly, for letting his son Jim run the team (into the ground). 2. Jim Buss, for refusing to take a chance on the kind of volatile, yet extremely talented, players that the Lakers sorely needed; for basing his player evaluations strictly on statistics; and for exhibiting stubbornness, arrogance, and the refusal to accept responsibility for his own misguided decisions &#151; characteristic of the most dangerous kind of ignoramuses. 3. Mitch "Cupcake" Kupchak, for being a dim bulb. Given the confusion and routine bungling in the front office, is it indeed possible that bringing Jerry West back to LA could save the franchise? As much as he's reiterated his plans to retire, the 69-year-old West would love to come riding into town as the savior. Equally attractive would be the prospect of being called upon to rectify Jackson's inability to re-lead the team to glory. Rightly or not, West has always been resentful of Jackson's coming to LA. Indeed, when West was still in the saddle and Jackson was unemployed after leaving Chicago, the Official Icon was asked how he'd feel about PJ's coming out of retirement to coach the Lakers. West's petulant response was this: "#%*& Phil Jackson!" Even in his dotage, however, West would be a vast improvement on Kupchak. But only if Jim Buss relinquished control of the roster and of his daddy's check book. And if West did decide to accept the role of savior, how much could he realistically accomplish? Despite his most recent surgery, Odom remains a valuable chip in any possible trades. Andrew Bynum even more so. Because of their inflated salaries and deflated skills, Radmanovich and Cook are impossible to deal. Brown's primary value is his expiring contract. That leaves the free agent market, which means that Buss Senior will have to abandon his monetary constraints and yield to the necessity of literally paying for his most recent sins of commission and omission by pumping up the payroll and suffering the surcharges. Maybe by curtailing his own personal expenditures, Buss will even be encouraged to start acting his age. In any case, there's no quick fix for the Lakers. So why should Kobe be expected to embrace spending what should be the peak years of his career care-taking a massive rebuilding effort? Perhaps the only realistic way out of the Buss mess is to grant Kobe's wishes and trade him for whatever proven All-Stars and on-track hooplings might be available. If Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar could be traded without the sky falling, then so can Kobe Bryant. The kicker here is that both Wilt and Kareem were traded to the Lakers!

STEPHEN DUNN / GETTY IMAGES Gary Matthews Jr. (24) of the Los Angeles Angels is greeted by Casey Kotchman (35) in front of Mariners catcher Kenji Johjima after Matthews hit a three-run home run in the first inning Wednesday. Geoff Baker's Mariners blog Notebook | M's Weaver not going on rehab assignment Talk about the team in Mariners forum ANAHEIM, Calif. &#8212; They fought an uphill battle all night as the opponents' drives kept leaving the park. But the Mariners simply could not avoid being beaten by the best player on the best team in the American League West. Every time Los Angeles Angels slugger Vladimir Guerrero strode to the plate Wednesday night, the runners on base in front of him left Mariners ace Felix Hernandez with no place to hide. And on a night when the Mariners needed their No. 1 starter in top form, the mistake-prone Hernandez reverted to being a 21-year-old with plenty to learn. The third home run yielded by Hernandez, a three-run Guerrero rocket in the sixth, was the difference in an 8-6 loss that erased any ground gained on the Angels in the past week. "We came here with a chance to really get close, but they played better," Mariners designated hitter Jose Vidro said. "It was tough to get those guys in front of Vladimir out." Both teams traded runs after Guerrero's fourth homer against Seattle pitching this season put Los Angeles up 7-5. Angels reliever Dustin Moseley carried the lead through the sixth and seventh &#8212; earning the win &#8212; while Scot Shields tossed a perfect eighth and Francisco Rodriguez a scoreless ninth for his 18th save. The Mariners fell 5-&#189; games behind the Angels because Hernandez served up three home runs after going 31-2/3 innings without allowing any. A pair of back-to-back, first-inning bombs to center &#8212; a three-run shot by Gary Matthews Jr. and a solo blast from Casey Kotchman &#8212; set Seattle on its heels. Then, after the Mariners rallied from 4-1 down to take a 5-4 lead and knock Angels starter Jered Weaver from the game in the fifth, Guerrero delivered the fatal blow. But the man who entered the at-bat hitting .577 off Seattle this season &#8212; with three homers, two doubles and eight runs batted in &#8212; once again had some help. Texas Rangers at Mariners, 7:05 p.m., FSN/KOMO (1000 AM) M's RHP Cha Seung Baek (2-2, 4.60) vs. RHP Vicente Padilla (2-7, 5.77). As they had been all series, the top two hitters in the Angels order, Reggie Willits and Orlando Cabrera, were standing on base. Willits got on three times, while Cabrera reached base the first four times he came up. "You've really got to concentrate there to get those hitters in front of him [Guerrero] out," Vidro said with a sigh. But the Mariners couldn't, and 39,288 fans at Angel Stadium buzzed with anticipation in the sixth. Hernandez could not afford to walk Guerrero intentionally with nobody out, or to nibble and fall behind. Hernandez jumped ahead 1-2 in the count with some nasty sliders. He even appeared to strike Guerrero out on a foul tip that catcher Kenji Johjima couldn't squeeze. But when Hernandez tried to jam Guerrero inside with a 95 mph fastball, it was lined more than 400 feet into the seats in right center. No more hopes of a series victory for the Mariners. No ground gained on a 6-4 trip that ended with Seattle a game worse off in the standings than when it headed to Cleveland last week. "I did what I wanted to do that at-bat," Hernandez said. "I threw that fastball because I wanted to. "He hit it. It was supposed to be a fastball, inside. The ball just got up in the zone and he hit it way back." All the home runs were tape-measure jobs. Matthews had crushed the ball to dead center in the first inning and Kotchman's homer was in the same vicinity. "Everything was up in the innings he got hit," Mariners manager Mike Hargrove said of Hernandez's pitches. "We'll go over it with him, that he's got to stay down." The Mariners will try to remember this trip for the good things. They will think about runners in scoring position driven home, not the eight left on base. About the 23-game hitting streak continued by Ichiro with a run-scoring single in the fourth. Not a fielder's choice grounder to third by Vidro right after, with the bases loaded and one out, to help strand three more runners. They will think about a first three-game series sweep in Kansas City. About taking five of six from the Royals and Devil Rays, then the opener here. Not about losing the final two games to fall to 2-7 against the Angels. "If we'd won tonight, it would have been a great road trip," Hargrove said. "That's what's disappointing. But the fact is, we had a good road trip." Just not good enough to make a difference.

(Adrian Wyld/AP) Yanks snap slide with big win over Jays Tribe pound Dice-K in finale Weaver shaky but Angels rally D-backs sweep behind Johnson Zito dominant as Giants blank Mets A-Rod defends controversial shout Lowe, Dodgers blank Nationals Young brilliant; Greene powers Padres &#149; Strange play in ninth Jays fight back, but can't sweep Yankees Jays notes: Clark makes unlikely return Wells, Rios vying for All-Star attention TORONTO -- Plenty of Blue Jays took the route of "no comment" on Wednesday night when approached about the latest controversy involving Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez. Toronto manager John Gibbons wasn't one of them. Sitting inside his office at Rogers Centre, Gibbons had plenty of kind words for the Yankees organization, but few for A-Rod. After all, a crucial ninth-inning play, in which Rodriguez appeared to confuse Toronto third baseman Howie Clark on a would-be inning-ending fly out, wound up costing the Jays three runs in a 10-5 loss to New York. "One thing you know about the Yankees, one of the reasons they're so respected, is they do things right," Gibbons said. "They always have. They have a lot of pride and a lot of class. They play the game hard. That's not Yankee pride right there. That's not the way they play. I thought it was bush league." The incident took place with two outs in the final inning, when the Jays were behind, 7-5. Yankees catcher Jorge Posada stepped in to face Jays rookie right-hander Brian Wolfe with Rodriguez on first base and Hideki Matsui on second. With the count at 3-2, the runners were in motion when Posada lifted a pitch from the reliever high in the air toward third base. Clark, who was called up from Triple-A Syracuse on Wednesday, camped under the ball, preparing to end the threat. As Rodriguez ran behind Clark on his way to third, he yelled out and the third baseman immediately pulled up, thinking Toronto shortstop John McDonald was calling for the ball. The baseball dropped to the turf, allowing Matsui to score. "I was under the fly ball and I thought I was called off," said the 33-year-old Clark. "It wasn't Johnny Mac. I let it drop. I was under it and I heard a 'Mine' call, so I let it go. "This is my 16th season, granted most of them are in the Minor Leagues, but that's never happened once. It happened tonight." The typically softspoken McDonald barked at Rodriguez, who stood on third base and could be seen occasionally smirking as Gibbons came on to the field to discuss the play with the umpires. After the game, McDonald declined to go into specifics about what took place as Rodriguez ran between he and Clark. "That's not really something I want to comment on," McDonald said. "I think it'd probably be better to look at the video to see, because I'm not exactly sure. You guys can draw the conclusion just from seeing the replay." Television replays, which featured slow-motion close-ups of Rodriguez's face, clearly showed him shouting something out as he ran directly behind Clark. It appeared as though he yelled, "Mine," which is what Clark indicated he heard. Rodriguez had a different version of the story altogether. "I was actually almost past third base [when I yelled]. I was surprised the ball dropped," Rodriguez said. "In a situation like that -- that play happens to me three or four times a week, except it's not at third base -- [it's] over by the dugout, foul territory. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't." Yankees manager Joe Torre added that he wasn't sure if Rodriguez tried to make it sound like he was calling off Clark, or if he simply shouted out as he sprinted toward third base. "I don't know what to feel," Torre said. "It's baseball. It's not like he said, 'I got it.' He didn't say that. He just made a noise. When catchers come over to the opposite dugout, everyone's saying, 'I got it, I got it, I got it.'" Rodriguez even went as far as comparing the play to Toronto second baseman Aaron Hill's successful steal of home during the Jays' 3-2 win Tuesday. "[The intention was] to win a game. We're desperate," Rodriguez said. "[On Tuesday] they made a great play stealing home. They did some great things yesterday, and I tip my cap to them. It's something that'll be unique -- something you don't see every day. Those guys have their opinion and our guys have ours. I'm fine with that." Regardless of what Rodriguez and Torre said, the players inside Toronto's clubhouse weren't happy at all with what took place. Blue Jays third baseman Troy Glaus, who sat out with a sore left hamstring, was quick to say he'd have some choice words for a teammate that pulled the same stunt. "You'd have to," said Glaus, who added that he had never seen a similar incident in his 10 big-league seasons. "You'd have to discuss and talk to him why that's not a good thing -- why that's not appropriate. "Not since I think 'Major League 2,' the movie [have I seen something like that]," he added with a laugh. "I've never heard of someone doing it and I've never seen anybody do it. I've never had it happen to me. It's disappointing. That's not proper." Toronto was especially disappointed because of what happened next. After Posada advanced to second on defensive indifference, Yankees designated hitter Jason Giambi drilled a pitch from Wolfe up the middle for two more New York runs. Essentially, the play turned a two-run deficit into a five-run hole for the Jays. "I don't get angry all that much," McDonald said. "It's unfortunate that us not making that play led to a few more runs and kind of put it out of reach for us in the ninth inning." Rodriguez is no stranger to on-field controversy, either. In Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series against the Red Sox, Rodriguez swatted a ball out of Boston pitcher Bronson Arroyo's glove during a play at first base. Earlier this month, Rodriguez threw a left elbow at Boston's Dustin Pedroia after the second baseman had already relayed a throw during a double play. "Who it is doesn't really matter," Glaus said. "It's just the fact that something like that happened. It's disappointing." Gibbons wasn't sure what the basis of his argument was when he headed onto the field, except to say that he didn't think it was right to do what Rodriguez had done. The baseball rulebook has plenty of guidelines for interference calls, but it doesn't specifically cover any of the verbal variety. "Maybe I'm naive, but I haven't seen that before," Gibbons said. "I don't even know if there's anything you can do -- maybe some kind of interference kind of thing. I don't know what the rulebook says. I've never seen that happen. "The Yankees have always done things right, so that surprised me." is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.

HOUSTON (AP) - Scott Hatteberg hit a solo home run in the eighth inning and Matt Belisle struck out a career-high eight Tuesday night to lead the Cincinnati Reds to a 2-1 victory over Houston, the Astros' ninth consecutive loss. Belisle (5-4) allowed only two hits after Adam Everett's RBI triple that was nearly an inside-the-park homer. Belisle, a native of Austin, Texas, threw 102 pitches in 7 2-3 innings, his longest outing since a complete-game victory over Pittsburgh on April 28. Adam Dunn knocked in a run with a sacrifice fly for the Reds, who won on the road for the third time in their last 12 games away from home. David Weathers got Carlos Lee to ground into a game-ending double play with the bases loaded in the ninth to pick up his 10th save. Jason Jennings gave up three hits with three strikeouts in his first start for Houston since April 8. Jennings was on the disabled list with tendinitis in his right throwing elbow. Chad Qualls (4-2) replaced Brad Lidge to start the seventh and took the loss. The Astros have lost nine in a row for the first time since September 1996. They lost to the Reds for just the third time in 10 meetings. Craig Biggio doubled with two outs in the second and scored the Astros' only run. Everett hit a sinking liner to center and the ball skidded past Norris Hopper when he couldn't make a diving catch. Hopper chased down the ball and hit Brandon Phillips with a relay throw as Everett rounded third. The throw home to Chad Moeller was high, but the catcher swiped the sliding Everett for the out at the plate. Jennings retired nine in a row after giving up three hits and walking two in the first two innings. He struck out Moeller and Belisle to end the fifth and was finished after 79 pitches. Rick White relieved to start the sixth and gave up a double to Hopper and a single to Hatteberg. Left-hander Trever Miller came on and walked Ken Griffey Jr. to load the bases. Lidge, who hadn't pitched since bruising his knee in San Francisco on May 21, replaced Miller and struck out Phillips. Dunn then flew out to deep center to score Hopper and tie it at 1. Belisle retired 11 consecutive Astros, four on strikeouts, after Morgan Ensberg's two-out single in the third. Lee ended the streak in the seventh with a one-out single to left, but Hunter Pence grounded into an inning-ending double play. With one out in the eighth, Hatteberg hammered Qualls' 2-0 pitch into the Astros' bullpen in right center. It was Hatteberg's fifth homer of the season and his second in three days. He hit career homer No. 100 against Pittsburgh on Saturday. Belisle got the first two outs of the eighth and was relieved by left-hander Jon Coutlangus, who struck out Jason Lane. Notes: Hopper led off and started in center field, both effects of his collision with Ryan Freel on Monday. The Reds placed Freel on the 15-day disabled list before the game.

Send a Letter to the Editor Corporate Photo Sales, Copyright Herald Sun Cartoons & Caricatures Memorabilia & Limited Editions Back Issues & Home Delivery Herald Sun - Sell your car for FREE Place a classified newspaper ad June 01, 2007 12:00am A LINESWOMAN'S error almost led to the unravelling of Lleyton Hewitt last night, before his fighting nature helped rescue his French Open campaign. Hewitt prevailed in five sets, beating 2004 French Open champion, Argentine Gaston Gaudio, 4-6 3-6 6-2 6-4 6-2 in more than 3 1/2 hours. It was another match Hewitt can add to his lengthening list of gritty claycourt performances where he has fought back against adversity. This time the setback came when the first set took an awkward deviation on the strength of a lineswoman's incorrect call. Gaudio was serving at 30-30 in the seventh game when Hewitt's forehand was wrongly called out. The Australian 14th seed had set the point up beautifully, working Gaudio to a section of court where he would be unable to counter Hewitt's return. However the lineswoman called the ball out, giving Gaudio a lucky reprieve. The error cost Hewitt a break point in a match that was waiting for somebody to falter. Chair umpire Pascal Maria did not need to cross the court fuly before he turned and reversed the call, ordering the point to be replayed. On the replayed point, Gaudio struck the net cord but the ball toppled over, giving him game point, which he converted. The frustration of such a missed opportunity temporarily side-tracked Hewitt. Serving in the next game, he fell behind 15-40 before surrendering the game at 30-40 when he found the net to give Gaudio the break. As is his way, Hewitt immediately turned and attended to his racquet strings, bottling the frustration inside. But it certainly affected him. Gaudio held serve to take the set 6-4 and broke Hewitt in the first service game of the second, going on to take the set 6-3. While he appeared no different in manner, Hewitt was obviously still trying to sort out his demons. It was a major turnaround. Both had slugged back and forth early on, feeling their way, and at times Hewitt had threatened to crack as the passionate Gaudio took to screaming at himself, as early as the fourth game. But the frustrations eroded just enough of Hewitt's concentration to open the door for the Argentine. Now a set up and with a break in the second, all the running was with Gaudio. It wasn't until Hewitt broke for the first time in the third game of the third set that his fire returned. While Hewitt suddenly carried himself differently, Gaudio double-faulted four times, failed to reach even a break point and generally walked like a schoolboy kicking stones. By the time the set was over, Hewitt had broken him again, and when Gaudio double-faulted to drop the opening game of the fourth, the door was not only open, Hewitt was leading the band through.

Orlando Cabrera wouldn't let them. Cabrera, who bats in front of Guerrero, went 3-for-4 with a walk, meaning the Mariners didn't have many opportunities to walk Guerrero, a man who pounds Seattle pitching. The Mariners battled back from an early 4-1 deficit to take a 5-4 lead in the fifth, but Felix Hernandez was about to discover the trouble with pitching to Guerrero. Hernandez had no choice once Reggie Willits and Cabrera reached base with none out. And Guerrero had no choice but to hit a three-run homer that was the pivotal blow in the Angels' 8-6 win. Whatever the Angels need against the Mariners, Guerrero gives them "Cabrera was the guy we had to get out, and we didn't," catcher Kenji Johjima said. "Because we didn't get him out, we had to face Guerrero." Guerrero is a good hitter at the worst of times. He's hitting .350 this year. But when you compare that number with what he's doing against Seattle -- 16-for-29, .552 this year -- Guerrero is in a slump against everybody else. "He's the best hitter I've ever faced," Hernandez said after the Mariners completed a 6-4 road trip, leaving them in second place, 5 1/2 games behind the Angels. "But I'm looking forward to seeing him again." The plan coming into the series was to walk Guerrero whenever possible. There were two intentional walks issued Tuesday, but for the most part Cabrera forced Seattle to pitch to Guerrero by collecting eight hits and two walks in 14 trips to the plate during the series. "We kept throwing the ball up and out over the plate to him," manager Mike Hargrove said. "That hurt." It didn't hurt as much as Guerrero's homer. With that one swing, the Angels won two of three from the Mariners instead of losing two of three. It's a two-game swing in the standings; Seattle could have been 3 1/2 games behind. They started the trip five games back. "We went 6-4, so it was a good trip," Hargrove said. "Anytime you go on the road and you win more than you lose, it's a good trip. If we'd won tonight, it would have been a great trip." Hernandez said he felt good going into the game. But he had trouble keeping the ball down in the strike zone, and when he didn't the Angels made him pay. The first indication of trouble was Gary Matthews Jr.'s three-run homer in the first, which was followed by a Casey Kotchman homer for a quick 4-1 Angels lead. The Mariners, who finished with 10 hits, clawed their way back with two runs in the fourth, but they left the bases loaded. They got two more in the fifth to take the lead and another in the sixth after Guerrero's homer, but that was the end of the line. Seattle, which has scored 98 of its 242 runs (40 percent) in the middle three innings, then shut down, getting just one base runner the rest of the night. That was DH Jose Vidro, who walked to open the ninth against closer Frankie Rodriguez. The Mariners brought the tying run to the plate three times, but they may as well have left their bats in the dugout. Rodriguez threw sliders in the dirt to Raul Ibanez, Jose Guillen and Ben Broussard, and all three went down swinging. The Mariners left Southern California disappointed but not distraught. One more win against the Angels would have made this a superb trip. But to win six of 10 in the middle of 23 games without a day off isn't shabby. And, hey, the Mariners are 23-17 against every team not named the Angels, and the Anaheim crew isn't on the schedule again until the final week of July, so the schedule is looking better. Maybe by then the Mariners will have come up with a way to get Guerrero out. Or, at least, shut Cabrera down. It was another nice night (69 degrees) in Southern California. STAR OF THE GAME: SS Orlando Cabrera went 3-for-4 with a walk and was in the middle of every Angels rally, forcing Seattle to pitch to the man who bats behind him, RF Vladimir Guerrero. PLAY OF THE GAME: Guerrero, who already had two singles, unloaded a three-run homer against RHP Felix Hernandez to lift the Angels from a 5-4 deficit to a 7-5 lead they never relinquished. Hernandez hadn't allowed a home run in 31 1/3 innings, but Wednesday the Angels tagged him for three, one each by CF Gary Matthews Jr., 1B Casey Kotchman and Guerrero. Matthews and Guerrero hit three-run shots. Hernandez wasn't at his best, giving up nine hits in six innings. RHP Sean Green let the Angels tack on a run before RHP Brandon Morrow took over. The Mariners came back from Tuesday's five-hit effort with 10 hits and six runs, but that proved insufficient as the Mariners didn't hit a single home run Wednesday against the three by the Angels. Kenji Johjima and 3B Adrian Beltre both had a couple of hits, and CF Ichiro Suzuki (23 games) and SS Yuniesky Betancourt (11 games) stretched out their hitting streaks. CF Matthews made a couple of well-above-average catches in center to keep the Mariners from scoring more than they did in the fourth and fifth. SS Betancourt was caught stealing on a hit-and-run to close out the fifth inning. 7:05 p.m., Safeco Field Add P-I Baseball headlines to Usual suspect does in M's Mariners Notebook: Shoulder improvement a relief for Ibanez Rainiers' Lehr in command Another impressive outing for Haren AL Notes: Twins push back Mauer's return NL Notes: Cardinals' Molina sidelined 4-6 weeks Angels fly by M's Mariners Notebook: M's up in air about whom they'll draft Jones' homers lead Rainiers Beckett picks up where he left off 'Stray-Rod?'

Red Sox Nation was counting on Matsuzaka to trigger a three-game sweep over the visitors from Cleveland. After all, he was the centerpiece of General Manager Theo Epstein's winter shopping spree and came into the game with a 7-2 record. Besides, the Red Sox -- and moreso their fans -- have a certain sense of entitlement: The thinking goes, ``Matsuzaka vs. Paul Byrd? Who are you kidding?'' But things don't always go according to form. It took the Indians the better part of six innings, but in the end, they dismembered Matsuzaka and left town with an 8-4 win. ``I think there was a little something extra for me to stop the slide,'' Byrd said. ``We're in first place, and there's a team one or two games behind us. So it's extra pressure, but that's why I came here.'' The Tribe lost two series on its nine-game trip to Kansas City, Detroit and Boston and still returned home with a 5-4 record, thanks to winning all three from the Tigers. ``These guys really played their tails off the whole trip,'' manager Eric Wedge said. ``We played pretty good baseball, even here. Boston just beat us the first two games.'' Byrd (6-1, 3.57 ERA) stopped the Sox's vaunted lineup cold for six innings, allowing one earned run (two total) and six hits. But in the seventh, he was stung for three consecutive singles and left with the bases loaded and nobody out. But even though the top of the lineup was set to face Byrd's replacement, Tom Mastny, the Sox failed to score. Mastny retired Coco Crisp and Kevin Youkilis, and Aaron Fultz induced David Ortiz to hit a semi line drive to Casey Blake at third. ``I would have liked to get through the seventh to give the bullpen a break,'' Byrd said. ``But it just wasn't in the cards.'' Byrd threw only 77 pitches and ran his string of walkless innings to 43. It helped that he threw first-pitch strikes to 25 of the 27 batters he faced. ``I take a lot of pride in making guys earn they way to first base,'' Byrd said. ``I'm not concerned with a personal streak. ``And the streak might have ended (in the fifth) against David Ortiz. There were two outs, and I threw the first pitch off the plate, but he swung and popped it up. If I had gone 2-and-0, I probably would have walked him.'' For four innings, Matsuzaka almost looked like a $103 million pitcher, the total paid by the Red Sox in salary and compensation to his former team in Japan. But Tribe batsmen saw enough pitches over that span to figure something out. And in the fifth and sixth innings, Matsuzaka looked more like a guy who should be earning the major- league minimum. Even before the Indians struck for their first two runs in the fifth, Matsuzaka got himself into and out of trouble. His most serious jam came in the first inning, when the Tribe loaded the bases (usually a bad sign) with one out, and Trot Nixon bounced into a double play. Matsuzaka's fortunes began to wane in the fifth. Kelly Shoppach kick-started the offense with a one-out single and stopped at third on Grady Sizemore's double. Casey Blake's ground out to short was enough to score Shoppach, and Travis Hafner's double brought Sizemore around. ``Matsuzaka really threw everything from the outset,'' Wedge said. ``We needed to see that. Once we did, we made some adjustments. I'm not going to tell you guys what they were.'' Things went south for Matsuzaka (7-3, 4.83 ERA) in the sixth. Even with a base-running mistake by Josh Barfield, he gave up four runs on five hits in the sixth inning. Included in the barrage were doubles by Nixon and David Dellucci, plus a two-run homer by Sizemore. In the middle of the rally, Barfield singled home Dellucci and advanced to second on Shoppach's second single of the game. But Barfield rounded second, and Manny Ramirez threw him out before he could get back to the bag. Except he didn't. Replays were conclusive in showing that second baseman Dustin Pedroia missed the tag, something that umpire Rick Reed didn't notice. Matsuzaka, who left after Sizemore's homer, was charged with six runs, 12 hits -- including six for extra bases -- and no walks. The 12 hits allowed are a Red Sox season high (Curt Schilling also gave up 12). ``He wasn't locating like he can, like he has, like he will,'' Sox manager Terry Francona said. Shoppach had four hits, including a home run, and Hafner doubled twice and singled, which might be a sign that he is finally emerging from his lengthy slump. According to Shoppach, there was no secret formula to making Matsuzaka a victim. ``We deserve a little credit for hitting a tough pitcher and getting him out of there a little early,'' he said. ``You just put your nose in there and get some hits.''

Unfortunately for the Red Sox, Daisuke Matsuzaka was not the lecturer. stymied the Sox with uncanny command and location while Matsuzaka allowed six runs on a season-high 12 hits and was yanked in the middle of an inning for the first time as a big leaguer as the Indians avoided a sweep by beating the Sox, 8-4, in the finale of a three-game series between the ALâ€™s top two teams in front of another sellout crowd of 37,091. The Sox, who began the day tied with the Indians for second in the AL in runs scored (276), had plenty of opportunities against Byrd, who took the concept of pitching to contact to an impressive extreme. He allowed nine hits and struck out one as the Sox swung and missed at just three of his 77 pitches. But Byrd avoided the big hit as he mixed and matchâ€”he complemented his mid-to-high 80s fastball with a cutter, slider, changeup and curveballâ€”on the corners of the strike zone. He opened the game with nine straight strikes, threw a first-pitch strike to 25 of the 27 batters he faced and went to a three-ball count just once as he extended his streak of innings without a walk to 43. He threw 61 strikes overall. â€œMan, I tell you what: I looked up at one point and I think he had close to 80 percent strikes,â€ said. â€œWe knew coming in heâ€™s not going to walk anybody. He has a lot of deception to his delivery and he threw a ton of strikes. Adding and subtracting, staying out of the middle. That was the kind of pitcher we expected. You have to hit him to beat him. Heâ€™s not going to give you anything.â€ The Sox were 1-for-11 with runners on base in the first six innings against Byrd, who surrendered RBI groundouts to in the second and in the fourth. â€œ[When] he has men in scoring position, he expands the zone just enough [so] that you are so aggressive that he gets you out,â€ said. â€œHeâ€™s a good pitcher.â€ Matsuzaka, meanwhile, worked out of trouble himself by stranding four runners in scoring position through four scoreless innings. But Matsuzaka allowed eight hitsâ€”five for extra basesâ€”to the final 11 batters he faced as the Indians tied the game with two runs in the fifth and surged ahead with four in the sixth. crushed Matsuzakaâ€™s final pitch over the right field fence for a two-run homer. â€œI didnâ€™t think he located his fastball like he has and like you need to against a team like Cleveland, with that lineup,â€ Francona said. â€œLeft a slider over the plate to Sizemore for the home runâ€¦against a lineup like that, if you donâ€™t consistently make pitches, they have that chance to hurt you. Even some of the fastballs [on which] he got outs tonight, e misfired on the other side of the plate and got outs. He wasnâ€™t locating like he can, like he has, like he will.â€ , back in the lineup after missing three games due to sore legs and dehydration, nearly tied the game with one swing of the bat in the seventh. Three consecutive singles in a span of six pitches to open the inning chased Byrd, but on a pop-out to third and struck out the scorching (extended his hitting streak to 22 games with a third-inning single) before left-hander came on to face Ortiz, who fouled off five pitchesâ€”including one he wrapped just right of the Pesky Poleâ€”before he lined out to to end the threat. â€œWe took some good swings, we just werenâ€™t able to really get things going all together at once [against Byrd],â€ Varitek said. â€œAnd then when we did, he was out of the game and they got two big outs right away. David had a heckuva at-bat. Just didnâ€™t come through. [Fultz] made a good pitch.â€ hit his first Fenway Park homer to spark a two-run eighth for the Indians, who racked up a season-high 18 hits. hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the frame for the Sox, whose AL East lead dropped to 10 Â½ gamesâ€”the first time since May 23 their lead has decreased.

As New York's Alex Rodriguez ran past Clark on the basepath, he yelled something that caused Clark to think he was being called off the play by shortstop John McDonald. The ball fell in and a run scored. Blue Jays stats, more Blue Jays 2007 schedule Photo gallery: Spring training Video: Jays fielding drills Shout leads to botched fielding play by Clark May 31, 2007 04:30 AM The Yankees left Toronto as victors. But that might be slim comfort as the team's biggest star heads out with his reputation in tatters after an on-field incident last night everyone connected with the Jays say is a first in their experience. With two out in the ninth and the Yankees on their way to a 10-5 win, Jorge Posada launched a sky-high pop-up. As substitute Jays third baseman Howie Clark settled under the ball, Alex Rodriguez ran past him on the basepath. Video replays clearly showed Rodriguez yelling something that was variously described by Jays on the field at the time as "Mine!" or "I got it!" Clark thought he was being called off by shortstop John McDonald. So he stepped out of the way and it fell in as another run scored. "I was under the fly ball and I thought I was called off ... and I let it drop. I heard a `Mine!' call," Clark said. Rodriguez admitted yelling, but denied calling for the ball. "I just said, `Ha!' ... that's it." Asked if he said, `Mine' or `Got it,' Rodriguez said, "I would never say that, that's not true. Basically guys, I could care less (what the Jays think). They have their opinions and we're looking at not getting swept. It was nothing personal. But I couldn't care less. My (teammates) in here think it's good." Rodriguez, earlier in the day, had to deal with a allegation that he had been spotted at a hotel and a Toronto strip club with a "mystery blonde." Rodriguez is married. After the controversial play, Jays manager John Gibbons stepped on the field to discuss it with the umpires. Distracting a fielder with a shout is a grey area in baseball, a no-no enforced by sportsmanship rather than the rulebook. "One of the reasons (the Yankees) are so respected is they've got a lot of pride, they do things right," Gibbons said, almost sadly. "That's not Yankee pride right there. I thought it was bush league. But it worked." "I don't know how to feel," Yankees manager Joe Torre said. "It's the game of baseball. It's not like he said, `I got it.' He didn't say that. He made a noise." The Yankees superstar seemed unabashed after the play, pushing away third base umpire Chad Fairchild as the official seemed to chide him. Rodriguez stood on third wearing a slight grin. "I don't get angry all that much," McDonald said, clearly biting his lip. "I don't remember a situation like that happening before." The Jays had battled gamely to climb back into the fray after going down five runs in the first. Rookie Jesse Litsch was rocked early and often and Gibbons yanked him after only two-thirds of an inning and five runs. Today, Litsch returns to Double-A New Hampshire to make way for Roy Halladay, who returns from injury against the visiting White Sox.

The United Football League hopes to field teams in eight cities that have no NFL franchises, including Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Mexico City. The founders are counting on fan support and a cable television deal to make the league profitable after five years. Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, already has signed on as team owner, according to a report Wednesday in the New York Times. But taking on the NFL, among the most popular leagues in professional sports and a television ratings juggernaut, is risky. A number of upstarts have tried and failed, such as the XFL, which folded in 2001 after one season, the United States Football League, which finished the last of its three seasons in 1985, and the World Football League, which survived two seasons in the 1970s. "The odds are against any competitive league that goes up against the NFL," said Dan Rascher, associate professor of sports management at the University of San Francisco. "Maybe if they play in the off-season -- there's plenty of football fans who want to see football 12 months a year." Hambrecht and Armstrong were unavailable for comment. The NFL declined a request for an interview. The new league is still in the early planning stages and is without players, coaches or much of an executive staff beyond two dot-com entrepreneurs who previously worked for the National Basketball Association. The likelihood of a UFL team in the Bay Area is remote, given that there already are two established NFL franchises in the area to compete against -- the Oakland Raiders and the San Francisco 49ers. Aside from Cuban, who is known for his bombast and iconoclastic business sense, no other owners are lined up for the league. Boone Pickens, a Texas billionaire, had intended to buy a team but recently pulled out, according to the Times. Owners would pay $30 million for an initial half-interest in a team, and the league would own the other half. Teams later would sell shares to the public in an effort to raise an additional $60 million per franchise. Star players, who demand multi-million-dollar salaries, are not likely to be recruited by the new league. Rather, lower tier players, including those cut from the NFL, will fill the ranks and be paid lower salaries. Rascher supported the new league's strategy to target cities without NFL teams, saying that many large markets with existing stadiums are hungry for football. Keeping ticket prices low may lure fans who are loathe to pay for the NFL's pricier seats. The New York Times first reported about the new league Wednesday. A Hambrecht spokeswoman confirmed that the article was accurate. Hambrecht is the founder and chief executive of WR Hambrecht + Co, an investment bank known for championing initial public offerings that are priced in an auction rather than in back-room deals. He also was a minority investor in the USFL's Oakland Invaders until the league shut. Armstrong is president of Google's advertising sales in North America and recently invested in a professional lacrosse franchise in Boston. Both men have pledged $2 million for the league. In doing so, they join a long list of successful businessmen who have tried their hands at professional sports, including Cuban and Oracle's Larry Ellison, who races yachts. Arena Football is now the only challenger to the NFL, and only to a limited extent. The upstart league, which plays in arenas that have a much smaller capacity than stadiums, fields eight-man teams and hold its season in the spring, so it doesn't compete with the NFL.

He didn't give up any runs at all. Outpitching Kansas City's Gil Meche, Bedard allowed four hits in eight innings Wednesday night and led Baltimore to a 3-0 victory, the fifth straight win for the Orioles and the seventh loss in a row for the hapless Royals. ''It's always tough when it's 0-0 late in the game,'' Bedard said. ''But you just stay in there and battle and good things will happen.'' Winless since April 18, Bedard (4-3) had five strikeouts and two walks in his longest outing of the season. Only one runner got past second against the left-hander. Jay Payton broke up the scoreless duel with an RBI single in the eighth and Nick Markakis, inserted into right field for defensive purposes, hit a two-run homer in the ninth off Zack Greinke. Meche (3-4) bounced back from his worst outing of the year to throw one of his best games since joining Kansas City. ''Gil was terrific,'' said Royals' manager Buddy Bell, who was ejected in the top of the eighth for arguing with Marty Foster after the home plate umpire had thrown out Emil Brown for arguing a called third strike. ''It's hard to win when you don't score any runs,'' Bell said. ''He gave us what we needed, but we couldn't do anything with Bedard.'' After matching Bedard with seven shutout innings, Meche departed when Payton grounded an RBI single through the hole into left with one out in the eighth. The right-hander gave up four hits and one run in 7 1-3 innings. He walked four and had five strikeouts after allowing seven runs and 11 hits in 4 1-3 innings his previous start. ''Coming out of a slump against Bedard is not an easy thing to do,'' Meche said. ''He just beat us.'' Chris Ray pitched a perfect ninth for his 12th save in 15 chances. Rain delayed the game at the start 1 hour, 36 minutes, then the pitchers did their best to get the fans home quickly. The game took 2:31. It had been so long since his last win, Bedard said he couldn't remember when it happened. ''I know it was a long time ago,'' he said. But frustration, he added, is ''part of the game.'' ''It happened the first two years. It happened last year. It happens every year,'' he said. ''You go through a span where you don't win for four or five games in a row, then you win five in a row. It's part of the game.'' Ramon Hernandez walked leading off the eighth for the Orioles, whose five-game winning streak is their longest of the season. Corey Patterson was safe at first when he laid down a bunt and beat the throw to the bag. The runners moved up on Brian Roberts' sacrifice bunt, and then Payton's single broke the scoreless tie. Greinke came in for Meche and struck out the next two batters, Miguel Tejada and Aubrey Huff, on six pitches, but surrendered a single to Kevin Millar ahead of Markakis' home run. Meche's lower back had tightened up in his previous start, rendering him ineffective. But facing a Baltimore lineup which had scored 31 runs and hit .315 while winning four in a row, he was dominant for seven innings. Mora singled leading off the second, then the right-hander retired 16 in a row before walking Roberts to lead off the sixth. The seven-game skid is the longest of the year for the Royals, who again have reclaimed the worst record in the majors. In getting swept three games by the Orioles, the Royals managed only three runs and 12 hits. They now begin a seven-game road trip to Tampa Bay and Cleveland. ''They're all frustrated,'' Bell said of his players. ''And I'm right there with them.'' Notes: Baltimore LHP Jamie Walker was passing out cigars celebrating the birth of his fourth child. He'd been away for two days to be with wife Natalie. ... Bell hadn't been thrown out of a game since April 9 at Toronto.

TIGER'S HAD HIS PHIL OF RIVALRY TALK Subscribe to RSS Feed Click here for all the latest golf scores Click here for European Tour calendar Click here for US Tour calendar Click here for more golf news Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson are both playing the Jack Nicklaus-hosted Memorial tournament in Ohio for the first time since 2002, and although fans will be desperate for the pair to do battle at the top of the leaderboard, Woods has downplayed the duel. Fans and media have long craved a legitimate rivalry between Woods and someone else, and for a while it looked like they had found one, as Mickelson won the 2005 PGA Championship and 2006 Masters. But after 'Lefty' melted on the final hole of the 2006 United States, making double bogey to hand Geoff Ogilvy victory, the rivalry had to be put on hold as Mickelson went into a mini slump. At the recent Players Championship, however, Mickelson was back to his brilliant best, blowing away the field barely a month after starting a swing renovation with new coach Butch Harmon. Whether he has the staying power to become a long-term rival to Woods remains to be seen, and Woods for one appears to have doubts. "Ever since I've been on tour they've been looking for a rivalry for me. I've had guys make different runs," said Woods, reeling off names such as David Duval, Ernie Els, Vijay Singh and Retief Goosen. Woods noted that Nicklaus had rivalries during his career with the likes of Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, Tom Weiskopf and Johnny Miller, but noted that true rivalries are sustained by long-term excellence. "You've got to do it a number of times to get that reputation," he said. "Watson and Trevino (beat) Jack, but they didn't do it one time, they did it a number of times. Repeatability is the key. You can't just do it once." Mickelson, for his part, was not interested in talking rivalry with Woods, no doubt aware that it does not pay to give the man any extra motivation. "It's flattering, to me anyway (but) probably not to him," Mickelson quipped. "I mean we're talking about probably the best player of all time." That said, Mickelson thinks there is plenty of room for improvement as he continues to refine his swing with Harmon. "We're probably halfway through," he said. "We have one or two more things I want to implement, but it's just taking a little bit of time to feel comfortable, especially in competition." Woods and Mickelson will play the Memorial with one eye on the United States Open, to be played in two weeks at Oakmont. They are both resuming from a fortnight off, but whereas Mickelson practised hard, Woods hardly touched a club, due to a myriad of sponsor commitments. Instead, he focused on his fitness regiment, confident there is plenty of time to get his swing back in the groove before the year's second major. "You've got to pick one or the other, and I picked getting my body in shape for the run to the U.S. Open," said Woods, who will take next week off to focus on his game."

Buy and sell tickets to premium and sold out events Search by events or regions: Looking to sell tickets quick? Byrd's pinpoint control helps Tribe win By Howard Ulman, AP Sports Writer BOSTON &#151; Even the most selective team in the league couldn't coax a walk out of Paul Byrd. Putting his pitches where he wanted, Byrd extended his walkless streak to 43 innings and threw first-pitch strikes to 25 of 27 hitters as the Cleveland Indians beat the Boston Red Sox 8-4 Wednesday night. "I don't know that I take pride in a walk streak. I take a lot of pride in making them earn their way to first base," he said. The loss snapped a five-game winning streak for Boston (36-16), which has the best record in the majors. Cleveland (32-19), with the AL's second best record, overcame a 2-0 deficit after four innings and avoided being swept in the three-game series. Byrd (6-1), who won his fifth straight decision, issued his last walk more than a month ago -- to Kenny Lofton of Texas on April 26 -- and has gone six games without throwing four balls on any at batter. The only Cleveland pitcher in the last 50 years with a longer streak than 43 innings is Dick Donovan, who went 45 1-3 in 1963. In 58 innings this year, Byrd has walked just three. Stopping the Red Sox from walking is impressive, considering they lead the league with 221. Cleveland catcher Kelly Shoppach said Byrd's ability to throw pitches close to the plate, but not down the middle, entices opponents to swing. "They may not get the pitches they want to hit. That's why they take them," Shoppach said. "As a pitcher and catcher, we want to attack them. We want them to swing the bat." Shoppach was the most productive swinger with a career-high four hits, including a solo homer in the eighth. The former Boston farmhand led Cleveland's season-high 18-hit attack. Daisuke Matsuzaka (7-3) allowed 12 in 5 2-3 innings. "Not only my fastball, but, overall, I think I had problems with my control," he said. Matsuzaka didn't walk anyone but left more pitches over the plate than Byrd. And he didn't get his usual support. In his previous 10 starts, the Red Sox scored 63 runs for him. But they hadn't faced Byrd yet. "We knew coming in he is not going to walk anybody," Boston manager Terry Francona said. "You have to hit him to beat him." Trailing 2-0, Byrd shut down Boston until Cleveland tied the game in the fifth and went ahead 6-2 in the sixth. "He's aggressive," Shoppach said. "If they're not knocking him all over the place, they're not giving us a reason to change our game plan." Matsuzaka had won his previous six decisions but was driven from the game in the sixth when he allowed four runs despite getting help from a poor call by second base umpire Rick Reed. Former Boston right fielder Trot Nixon led off with a double and scored the tie-breaking run on David Dellucci's double. Josh Barfield singled to left, scoring Dellucci. Shoppach then singled Barfield to second. But Barfield rounded the base and was called out trying to get back when left fielder Manny Ramirez threw behind him to Dustin Pedroia, who swiped at the runner. Barfield and manager Eric Wedge argued and replays showed Pedroia missed Barfield by a wide margin. Two pitches later, Grady Sizemore hit his ninth homer, giving Cleveland a 6-2 lead and bringing Kyle Snyder in for Matsuzaka. "I don't know if he struggled as much as they hit him," Boston catcher Jason Varitek said. "They were able to get one pitch each at-bat." Kevin Youkilis extended his hitting streak to a career-best 22 games, but his stretch of multihit games ended at nine. He made a costly out in the seventh when the Red Sox loaded the bases with no outs on three singles that knocked Byrd out of the game. Youkilis struck out for the second out before David Ortiz lined the ball just foul past the right field pole then was retired on a soft liner. Mike Lowell added a two-run homer, his 10th, in the eighth. Boston had taken a 2-0 lead on RBI grounders by Varitek in the second and J.D. Drew in the fourth. Cleveland tied it in the fifth on a single by Shoppach, a double by Sizemore, a run-scoring groundout by Casey Blake and an RBI double by Travis Hafner. Notes:@ Ramirez turned 35 years old on Wednesday. ... Cleveland starters have walked fewer than three batters in the last 16 games ... Lowell extended his home hitting streak to 22 games. ...

NEW YORK - Barry Zito was the highest profile free agent pitcher on the market this winter, the New York Mets had a glaring need in their rotation, and their fans are used to getting spendy gifts at Christmas. Maybe that's why Mets fans showered Zito with colorful language while the Giants left-hander warmed up in the Shea Stadium bullpen Wednesday night. "It's always great coming to New York," Zito said. "You get all those trash talkers saying everything they can think of. That's what makes this place special." Zito showed them what they're missing. He held the high-powered Mets lineup scoreless over seven innings and struck out a season-high seven batters in a 3-0 victory at Flushing Meadows. The Mets hadn't been shut out this season. It was an important bounce-back victory for the Giants, who lost in 12 innings Tuesday night when Armando Benitez had a balk-a-thon on the mound. Brad Hennessey became the closer Wednesday because Benitez had an inflamed right knee. It was an important prove-it start for Zito, especially after anonymous Mets officials chirped about his tame fastball and decried the &#36;126 million the Giants showered upon him. "You know, I don't really want to pitch with any kind of vendetta against people," Zito said. "For me, it's just about being aggressive, throwing strikes and hoping for the best." Zito's 84 mph fastball worked just fine because he spotted it on the corners and dropped in both varieties of his breaking ball for strikes. He walked only one batter and he gave the Giants innings on a day they needed to go light on their bullpen. Since walking seven in his May 18 loss at Oakland, Zito is 2-0 and has issued just three walks over 14 innings. "A lot was said about him pitching here, but we needed it," Giants Manager Bruce Bochy said. "He can pitch. He'll throw a lot of great back-to-back games. That's why we got him. He showed what he's about tonight." Zito had a good support network behind him. Pedro Feliz hit a two-out, two-run single off Tom Glavine in the first inning and lined an RBI triple in the third. Bengie Molina worked an eight-pitch walk in the first to extend the rally; Molina also singled on a lengthy at-bat ahead of Feliz's triple. Shortstop Omar Vizquel was 0 for 4 but contributed an assortment of highlight plays, including bare-handed pickups to throw out Endy Chavez in the first and Damion Easley in the fourth. And Rich Aurilia broke out of a 5-for-51 slump by tying his career high with four hits. Aurilia, whose stiff neck is coming around, said he made adjustments after teammates noticed a flaw in his approach. Barry Bonds singled and scored in the first inning but otherwise had a quiet 1-for-3 night with an intentional walk. Bonds was just as nondescript before the game, when he relented to the New York media throng and repeated his non-thoughts on the home run record, Bud Selig and Hank Aaron. After the game, the cameras and reporters awaited the other Barry. New York might be special, but it's not easy being a visible baseball star here. You needed only to look at the cover of Wednesday's New York Post, which splashed photos of Yankees star Alex Rodriguez getting into a hotel elevator with a blond woman who wasn't his wife. The headlines were "Stray-Rod" and "A-Rod's A Yankee Doodle Randy." The fans in the outfield at Shea weren't nearly as clever. "Nah, not creative at all," Zito said. "Just blatant expletives right at me." Contact Andrew Baggarly at abaggarly@mercurynews.com The Mercury News is pleased to let readers post comments about an article at the end of the article.

The league -- to be named the United Football League -- already boasts billionaire Mark Cuban, who owns the National Basketball Association's Dallas team, among its owners, the paper said. Hambrecht, Google and Cuban were not immediately available to comment. The plan is for eight teams to begin preseason games in August 2008, according to the paper. The UFL would be the latest in a series of leagues to compete with the NFL since the 1970s, including the World Football League, the United States Football League and most recently the XFL -- all of which failed. An NFL spokesman declined to comment. David Carter, executive director of the USC Sports Business Institute said the effort should not be dismissed, but it will be an uphill battle to establish the new league. "The NFL is clearly so very powerful that they've done a fantastic job of being able to fend off upstart leagues by ensuring that there are never enough open or underserviced markets available to make a start-up league successful," he said. "On the surface, if history tells us anything, it can't possibly work," Carter added. "But -- this is going to sound like Yogi Berra -- history was a long time ago and now the landscape has changed. The right people properly capitalized should never be taken for granted." Success for the UFL may not mean long-term existence as a league, but a place for some of its teams as expansion members in the NFL, Carter said. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Hewitt climbs off the canvas again Back from the red &#133; Lleyton Hewitt celebrates after his gritty come-from-behind win against Gaston Gaudio at Roland Garros. PARIS: A trademark Lleyton Hewitt fightback put the Australian into the third round of the French Open with victory over 2004 champion Gaston Gaudio. No.14 seed Hewitt relishes a dogfight and he got just that on Thursday, heaving himself up from two-sets-to-love down to beat the Argentine 4-6, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 in three hours and 28 minutes. He next meets Finnish No.20 seed Jarkko Nieminen, who beat Frenchman Mathieu Montcourt in straight sets. Hewitt had looked down for the count after Gaudio established his dominance early in the match. The world No.72 converted the second of two break points in the ninth game of the first set to take a 5-4 lead and claimed the opener on his own serve with a smash. Gaudio kept the momentum, breaking Hewitt in the opening game of the second set when the Australian hit a backhand wide, charging on to eventually take a two-sets-to-love lead. Hewitt then dragged himself back into the match in the third game of the third set when Gaudio handed him a break with a double fault. It was all he needed to spark a remarkable resurgence. The 26-year-old baseliner went on to convert the second of two break points against Gaudio in the seventh game with a sharp return and Hewitt closed out the set with a backhand that shot past his opponent. Two double faults by Gaudio in the opening game of the fourth set gave Hewitt an early break. Hewitt's famed calls of "C'mon!" had barely been audible to that point, but when he saved break point in the second game, the volume increased markedly. He sent down a 205kmh bullet for set point and levelled at two sets all with a forehand down the line. Hewitt broke Gaudio in the opening game of the decider when the former world No.5 sent a backhand long and the Australian won his next service game to love with an ace. Hewitt broke Gaudio again in the fifth game and again won his service game to love before serving for the match. He brought up three match points with an ace and converted the first when Gaudio sent a forehand long. In other second-round matches No.16 seed Marcos Baghdatis beat Kristian Pless 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 while 20-year-old Serbian prodigy Novak Djokovic, the No.6 seed, beat Laurent Recouderc 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1. Meanwhile, top seed Roger Federer was furious with French Open officials who scheduled his second-round match to start and finish in the murky Paris gloom. The world No.1, who needs a Roland Garros title to complete the set of grand slams, rounded off his 6-1, 6-2, 7-6 (10-8) victory over French wildcard Thierry Ascione just before 9.15pm local time on Wednesday with Court Suzanne Lenglen in near-darkness. "When we shook hands, I told him I couldn't see him anymore it was so dark," Federer said. "The conditions were shocking. I know they want to get the matches over and done with, but what I don't like is that they know I'm the favourite and they think I should win in straight sets. 'Let's get Roger's match over and done with, then he's happy, he has a day off'. But what if it doesn't turn out this way? I would be very upset. I already wasn't happy playing so late. "I hate playing into dawn. I can hardly see the ball. You start stressing out. I can't believe other players were still playing after me because it was so dark." Federer was referring to France's Edouard Roger-Vasselin's five-set win over Radek Stepanek, which didn't finish until 9:30pm. The Swiss star said the situation reminded him of his heartbreaking semi-final defeat to Rafael Nadal in 2005, which was played in similar dismal conditions. On that occasion, Federer wanted the match called off for the day. "I wanted to stop that match, but there was pressure from the crowd, from television, from my opponent - and if you don't agree with your opponent, you're stupid." At one stage on Wednesday, Federer looked as if he would have the match wrapped up quickly as he raced to a two-set lead inside 48 minutes as the world No.168 was outclassed. But Federer wasted two match points in the ninth game of the third set and three more in the subsequent tie-breaker before he managed to move into the third round, where he faces Italy's Potito Starace. Federer, attempting to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 - and just the third man in history - to hold all four grand slam titles at the same time, was playing for the third day in a row after rain forced his first-round victory over America's Michael Russell to start on Monday and finish on Tuesday. But he showed no signs of fatigue, closing out the first set in 22 minutes, allowing Ascione just four points on his serve. send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today Hewitt climbs off the canvas again Back from the red &#133; Lleyton Hewitt celebrates after his gritty come-from-behind win against Gaston Gaudio at Roland Garros.

(Gettyimages.com) The startling trade demand of arguably the NBAâ€™s best player looks to be the sensation of this summer in the world of US sports. This we did not foresee. The NBA&rsquo;s best player, in his prime, asking for a trade. The greats before him (Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson) all stayed with one team through their whole career, or at least through their most productive years. The closest thing we&rsquo;ve had in the recent past is Shaquille O&rsquo;Neal&rsquo;s two moving projects, yet both times the move was not all that unexpected. Shaq was alienated by the fans and team management in Orlando. In some strange way, he always was only second after Penny Hardaway. Thus his move to Los Angeles was seen as a must. His way out of LA was a minor shock, but considering the fact that he was starting to show wear and tear L.A.&rsquo;s move was seen as being at least some parts right. It&rsquo;s ironic that Kobe&rsquo;s trade demand has quite a lot to do with how the organization (mis)handled the Shaq trade. The possible impact of this is unfathomable. I&rsquo;m pretty much 100% sure that every single team&rsquo;s management is holding extra meetings, working the phones, trying to find a scenario where they would get Kobe. With that in mind I have tried to get the most realistic trade possibility for each team. Here are the results: Josh Childress, Marvin Williams, Joe Johnson and this year&rsquo;s No. 3 draft pick for Kobe and Ronnie Turiaf Why it could happen: The Lakers would get exactly what they would most covet for Bryant - a host of young, extremely talented, players and a high draft pick. An extra plus goes to the fact that the Hawks are in the Eastern Conference, far-far away from Los Angeles. The league office would also love this move, as it would energize a Hawks franchise that has been in lethargy for many years. Why it won&rsquo;t happen: Kobe can nix any deal and he knows he can do better than a team featuring Josh Smith and a bunch of unknowns. Gerald Green, Sebastian Telfair, Brian Scalabrine, Theo Ratliff and many first round draft picks for Kobe and Ronnie Tuiaf Why it could happen: The Lakers could pair up fellow draftees Green and Andrew Bynum plus Ratliff would mean tremendous cap relief after next season. Add in a No. 5 pick from this season and a bunch of future No. 1s and it helps ease the pain that the loss of Bryant would mean. Meanwhile Boston would become an immediate contender with the duo of Paul Pierce and Kobe. Bryant would also be moving from one historical team to the next. Why it won&rsquo;t happen: You think the Lakers would aid arch nemesis Boston in getting back into the upper echelon of the NBA? Fat chance of that ever happening, although it is still better than sending Bryant to their crosstown rivals. Brevin Knight, Sean May, Derek Anderson, Gerald Wallace for Kobe Why it could happen: It is an enticing package of players who fit into the triangle offense orchestrated by Phil Jackson and a player that is fast becoming a dominant force. Wallace is the type of energy guy who would become a fan favorite in La-La land. Meanwhile Kobe would anchor a talented young team with Emeka Okafor, Raymond Felton and Adam Morisson. Why it won&rsquo;t happen: The Lakers will probably not settle for such a package whilst I can not see how the Bobcats would give up any more than that. : Chris Duhon, Ben Gordon, Andres Nocioni and New York&rsquo;s first round pick for Kobe and Jordan Farmar Why it could happen: The Lakers get key pieces for a running team, a top ten pick and they send Kobe to the Eastern Conference. The Bulls get Kobe &ndash; isn&rsquo;t that enough? In the East whoever gets Bryant instantly becomes a beast, at least that is what Chicago would hope for with such a trade. Why it won&rsquo;t happen: Chicago could become the winner of the Bryant sweepstakes, but it would probably take the inclusion of Luol Deng. It might be too steep a price but Chicago seems determined to win now, and Kobe could help them immensely. : Larry Hughes, Shannon Brown, Drew Gooden, Daniel Gibson multiple draft picks for Kobe and Vladimir Radmanovic Why it could happen : Just imagine Kobe and LeBron James playing alongside each other. A dream come true, right? All the while the Lakers get useful players, possible cap relief and draft picks, plus they get to unload Vlad-Rad&rsquo;s dreadful contract. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : The Lakers certainly can get better offers than what the Cavs can offer. : Jason Terry, Jerry Stackhouse, Devin Harris, draft picks for Kobe and Smush Parker or Jordan Farmar. Why it could happen : The Mavs have enough valuable pieces to make this deal work. After a first round exit in this year&rsquo;s post season they certainly have to consider trades, even if they did win a record number of games. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : For Dallas to remain at the top of this strong Western Conference they should keep energetic Josh Howard and superstar Dirk Nowitzki. I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Lakers would want one of the two especially since they are keeping Kobe in their conference with such a move. : Allen Iverson, Nene, J.R. Smith for Kobe Bryant and Kwame Brown. Why it could happen : The Lakers manage to move Kwame&rsquo;s scary contract. They also get a dominant scorer and a strong post player for Bryant. Denver would pair Carmelo Anthony with Kobe. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Denver is in the west. A.I. is aging. Otherwise this is seemingly a solid move. Richard Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince, Nazr Mohammed for Kobe and Radmanovic. Why it could happen: Radmanovic&rsquo;s contract gets unloaded. Hamilton and Prince combined would provide the same amount of defense and offense that Kobe would. The Pistons need to re-sign Chauncey Billups. Together with Rasheed Wallace and Kobe they would be the best threesome in the league. Oh, and Detroit would finally get that true go-to guy they&rsquo;ve been lacking. Why it won&rsquo;t happen: If the Pistons win the title, they will not be aggressive enough with trade offers. If they fail at any point in the play-offs then something might just get done. : Stephen Jackson, Patrick O&rsquo;Bryant, Baron Davis for Kobe and Radmanovic. Why it could happen : Bad contract being unloaded. Baron is probably the closest to Kobe as far as willing a hopeless team to win. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Kobe will nix this if Baron is moved. The Warriors can&rsquo;t offer much else to make the numbers work. : Tracy McGrady and a first round pick for Kobe. Why it could happen : The only feasible straight up trade scenario. T-Mac gets almost as much hype as Kobe and he is close to reaching that upper echelon Kobe already has. Meanwhile Bryant is not only an upgrade for the Rockets, but he is far less injury prone than T-Mac. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : It is too logical for both teams, although I would love to see what Phil Jackson could add to T-Mac&rsquo;s game. : Danny Granger, Mike Dunleavy, Troy Murphy, Jamal Tinsley for Kobe, Brian Cook and Maurice Evans. Why it could happen : Kobe would love to team up with his friend, Jermaine O&rsquo;Neil. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : The Pacers do not have enough to make this work. : Tim Thomas, Sam Cassell, Corey Magette and draft picks for Kobe. Why it could happen : This trade would make sense. The Lakers get cap relief, a solid bench contributor and a talented youngster. The Clippers get Kobe. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Never in a million years would the Lakers help the Clippers! : Rudy Gay, Stromile Swift, Dahntay Jones, Mike Miller and this year&rsquo;s no 4 pick for Kobe and Maurice Evans. Why it could happen : A last favour for Jerry West? Why it won&rsquo;t happen : The Grizzlies do not have enough pieces. Include Gasol and Kobe will not be willing to go there, exclude him and the Lakers want no part of the deal. : Half the roster (mostly Posey, Jason Williams, Antoine Walker) for Kobe and parts to make salaries match. Why it could happen : Beats me. The Lakers would probably help Miami to another title with any such move. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Shaq and Wade are off the table, and the Lakers do not need the has-beens Miami has to offer. Michael Redd, Ruben Patterson and first round pick for Kobe. Why it could happen : In essence you switch Redd for Kobe as far as Milwaukee is concerned. As for the Lakers they get good defense from Patterson, masterful shooting from Redd and a high draft pick. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Redd could team with Bynum in another system, but with the triangle in place, they lack the passing skills necessary. : Randy Foye, Rashad McCants, Ricky Davis, Justin Reed, Mike James and draft picks for Kobe, Why it could happen : The Lakers would get half a team for Kobe, which seems about right. Davis&rsquo; contract means cap relief next summer whilst Foye and McCants are young and talented. Kobe would team with Kevin Garnett to create the top duo in the NBA. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : It still does not seem like fair value for Kobe. Neither Foye nor McCants are set to become superstars so there isn&rsquo;t enough upside to make this work. : Richard Jefferson, Jason Collins, Marcus Williams and draft picks for Kobe and Jordan Farmar. Why it could happen: Williams has been learning from Jason Kidd and he seems like a very good future starter. Jefferson is the youngest of the Nets&rsquo; big three, Collins brings hard nosed defense to a team severely needing it. I don&rsquo;t think I need to explain just how great a Kobe, Vince Carter, Jason Kidd trio could be. Why it won&rsquo;t happen: Carter cannot be included because he can nix any deal and he certainly will not approve moving to a Lakers team with less talent than his worst Raptors teams. The trade stated here works under the cap rules, but is it enough to entice the Lakers? : Stephon Marbury, Channing Frye, Renaldo Balkman and draft picks for Kobe and Radmanovic. Why it could happen : The Knicks are always in win-now mode, meaning they would send every first round pick they have until 2020 to get Bryant if that is what it takes. This package has star power and young talent plus as many draft picks as the Lakers want. With Kobe, Eddy Curry and David Lee the Knicks would be huge contenders to represent the East in the finals. Why it won&rsquo;t happen: We are talking about Isiah Thomas the GM, not Isiah Thomas the coach &ndash; enough said! Peja Stojakovic, Desmond Mason, draft picks for Kobe. Why it could happen : Everyone wans to help New Orleans in their first full season back home, why shouldn&rsquo;t the Lakers be in a giving mood. Just imagine Chris Paul dishing to Kobe. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : It would take the inclusion of David West and/or Chris Paul to make this deal work. There&rsquo;s no way the Hornets should give up that much for anybody. : Darko Milicic, Grant Hill, JJ Redick, draft picks for Kobe. Why it could happen : Hill is a short term fix, Milicic is a work in progress, but the chance of pairing him with Bynum could be enticing. Dwight Howard with Kobe? Dreamy! Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Hill would never agree to this sign and trade. He&rsquo;ll either retire or go to a contender. The Lakers will not be contending sans Kobe. : Andre Miller, Kyle Korver, Joe Smith, draft picks for Kobe. Why it could happen : Miller has played hard wherever he was. He also is capable of making a team overachieve. Allen Iverson never managed to get it going with Andre Iguodala, Kobe could however be the Jordan to his Pippen. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : If this goes to a bidding war Philly do not have enough pieces, but they do have the advantage of being Kobe&rsquo;s home town. : Shawn Marion, Boris Diaw, Marcus Banks for Kobe and Ronnie Turiaf. Why it could happen : The Suns&rsquo; package is valued high. Marion is an All-Star, Diaw is an all-around all-world talent, Banks might not have fit in well with the Suns&rsquo; style, but physically he is the perfect player for the triangle offence. I can not even fathom Kobe in the free flowing system of Mike D&rsquo;Antoni alongside Steve Nash. This would be too good to be true. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : The Suns are a top divisional rival of the Lakers, so they pretty much can forget about getting Bryant for anything less than Amare Stoudemire, and even that is a longshot. Darius Miles, Zach Randolph, Brandon Roy, future draft picks for Kobe. Why it could happen : The Blazers definitely keep this year&rsquo;s pick to select Greg Oden. Add Kobe and this is a contender straight away. The Lakers get this year&rsquo;s rookie of the year and an all-star next to the extremely talented but troublesome Miles. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Portland plays in the west. Plus the Lakers would hold out for Oden if they were to deal with the Blazers. Kenny Thomas, Ron Artest, Kevin Martin, John Salmons for Kobe and Farmar. Why it could happen : You&rsquo;re teaming up Mike Bibby, Brad Miller and Kobe &ndash; that is a devastating trio. Meanwhile the Lakers get quality starters for four positions and two of them are borderline All-Stars. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Same as the Suns, as division rivals it is going to be tough for the Kings to get into the bidding. : Brent Barry, Manu Ginobili, Robert Horry for Kobe. Why it could happen: Because the salaries match. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : After the Clippers, the most unlikely team the Lakers would deal with is the Spurs. Just forget this one unless Duncan is on the table, and he will never be. : Rashard Lewis and the Kevin Durant pick for Kobe. Why it could happen : Believe me, the Lakers would love it if Seattle were to offer this trade. Teaming up Ray Allen and Kobe would at the very least be interesting. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Kobe will not want to go to a team so badly in limbo as the Sonics. : Rasho Nesterovic, Anthony Parker, Jos&eacute; Calderon, Juan Dixon, Morris Peterson for Kobe and Brian Cook. Why it could happen : Another scenario where the Lakers get almost half of a whole team. Every single one of these players are hard workers and team players. Kobe paired with Bosh and TJ Ford would tear the East apart. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : This is the best the Raptors can realistically offer, plus Kobe probably does not want to be north of the border. : Andrei Kirilenko, Matt Harpring, draft picks for Kobe and Maurice Evans. Why it could happen : A perfect fantasy trade from last season. Kobe teaming up with the Carlos Boozer-Derron Williams duo is a scary thought. Kind of like imagining Jordan together with John Stockton and Karl Malone. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : I don&rsquo;t think I need to explain this: Kobe is not going to Salt Lake City. : Gilbert Arenas, Jarvis Hayes, Etan Thomas, draft picks for Kobe. Why it could happen : One of the best value deals. Agent Zero would probably love to show that he&rsquo;s better than Kobe by taking the Lakers to the second round of the play-offs. Whilst that is a longshot, imagine Antawn Jamison, Caron Butler and Kobe running Eddie Jordan&rsquo;s smooth offense together. Why it won&rsquo;t happen : Actually, this one is feasible, but if there is a bidding war, as expected, the Wizards would be reluctant to include anyone else. So just where will Kobe end up? We might not know for quite a while, but there&rsquo;s a better chance of him landing with a team in the Eastern Conference. Of course, this is a Knicks fan talking here, so I might just be pressing my luck . . . Where do you think Kobe will end up? Post your thoughts below or submit your own article to Sportingo.

A visual tour of the battle for NHL supremacy between the Ducks and Senators A nation of rabid hockey fans watching the game on CBC (the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) on Wednesday got a lengthy close-up of Ottawa winger Mike Comrie, sitting on the Senators bench in recovery mode. Blood flowed slowly from both nostrils after an elbow from Anaheimâ€™s Francois Beauchemin, and a Senators trainer stood behind Comrie, working feverishly to stop the bleeding. Welcome to Bryan Murrayâ€™s world. The Ottawa Senators head coach needs to stop the bleeding â€” not now, but right now â€” with his Senators suddenly trailing this Stanley Cup finals 2-0. His team lost Game 2 by a 1-0 score, and for all intents and purposes, their season and another Canadian run at a Stanley Cup will hang in the balance Saturday night in Ottawa, where Game 3 will be played. Ottawa needs to win four of the next five games to salvage this Cup run, a Herculean task against an Anaheim team that looks oh so good right now. â€œWe just have to take advantage of home-ice advantage,â€ Murray said after the game. â€œWe've played well in our own building. We have to do it â€” absolutely have to do it this time â€” and give ourselves a chance to come back here and get one.â€ Murray has goaltending in spades, with Ray Emery playing his guts out in Game 2. But the girl that brought the Senators to this dance â€” their top line of Jason Spezza, Daniel Alfredsson and Dany Heatley â€” has suddenly lost her step in the face of Anaheimâ€™s tenacious checking unit centered by the hero of Game 2, goal scorer Samuel Pahlsson. For the second straight game, the Ducks checking line shut the Spezza line down while firing home the game-winning goal in the third period. In Game 1 it was Travis Moen, while last night Samuel Pahlsson lapped up a Heatley turnover near center ice, hopped in over the blue-line and snapped an unassisted goal that broke a scoreless tie at 14:16 of the third period. The puck went through defenseman Joe Corvoâ€™s legs before sneaking over the right pad and under the stick of goalie Ray Emery, who had played like a champion to hold an overmatched Senators team in the game. â€œOf course, itâ€™s fun to score the goal,â€ Pahlsson said. â€œBut itâ€™s always about winning in the playoffs. It doesnâ€™t really matter who does it.â€ We now have three days to marvel about what a fine team Brian Burke has built here in SoCal. The pressing issue as the series moves north, however, is what happened to the Senators? They won each of their first three series in five games, and Spezzaâ€™s line was far and away the most productive unit in these NHL playoffs â€” until now.

Last year Edmonton lost a seven-game final to Carolina, and in â€˜04 â€” with the lockout year in between â€” Tampa Bay beat Calgary in seven as well. â€œObviously,â€ said Spezza, who wasnâ€™t very good in Game 1 or 2 in Anaheim. â€œWeâ€™re the top line on the team, weâ€™ve been scoring up to this point, and weâ€™re expected to score goals. â€œItâ€™s not through lack of effort,â€ he added. â€œWeâ€™re trying. We know we have to better though.â€ Now the stats are starting to really side with Anaheim as well: Of 30 teams to win Games 1 and 2 at home in Stanley Cupâ€™s modern history, only once did they fail to win the Cup, when the Montreal Canadiens came back on Chicago in 1970.

A short time later, West retires as GM and Mitch Kupchak takes over. With Bryant averaging 29.4 points in playoffs, Lakers beat Philadelphia 4-1 for second consecutive title. Lakers sweep New Jersey to win third NBA title in row. Bryant averages career-high 32.1 points in playoffs, but Lakers fall to San Antonio in Western Conference semifinals. Bryant is arrested and charged with sexual assault alleged in June at Colorado resort. Last season together for Bryant, O'Neal and Jackson is filled with turmoil -- including ongoing distraction of Bryant's sexual-assault case where he often shuttled between Colorado court proceedings and Lakers games. Yet Lakers make it to NBA Finals before falling to Detroit 4-1. After season, Jackson resigns, O'Neal is traded to Miami and Bryant signs $136 million deal. Sexual-assault case against Bryant is dropped when prosecutor says accuser could not advance case. Accuser later files civil suit that is settled for undisclosed amount. Lakers, without Jackson and O'Neal, miss the playoffs for only second time in 29 years. Jackson returns as head coach of Lakers. Bryant averages 35.4 points, the NBA's best in nearly 20 years. Jan. 22 he scores 81 against Toronto, second all time to Wilt Chamberlain's 100. Lakers are eliminated in first round by Phoenix after leading 3-1. O'Neal's Miami Heat, meanwhile, win first NBA title. he didn't tell ESPN in recent interview that he wanted West back and in full control or he would ask to be traded. "I would love for him to be a part of this," Bryant says. "But it's not something where I demand he comes here. ... I love being a Laker. I want to retire a Laker. I want to fix this thing or at least help any way I can." Bryant becomes infuriated after quotes Lakers "insider" as saying it was Bryant's insistence on getting away from O'Neal that prompted O'Neal's trade to Miami. Bryant tells ESPN Radio, "I would like to be traded. ... Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative." -- Bryant talks about meeting with owner Jerry Buss: "I went up to his penthouse suite. (Buss) looks me dead in the face and says, 'Kobe, I am not going to re-sign Shaq. I am not about to pay him $30 million a year or $80 million over three years. No way in hell. ... This is my decision. It's independent of you. My mind is made up. It doesn't matter to me what you do in free agency because I do not want to pay (Shaq).' " -- O'Neal responds to Bryant. "I believe Kobe 100%. Absolutely. There's no doubt in my mind Kobe is telling the truth. I believe him a thousand percent." -- Later Wednesday, after Bryant talks with Jackson, "I always dreamed about retiring as a Laker. I just hope and hope that something can be resolved. Something can be figured out. Just something so I can stay here." Is Kobe Bryant trade bait, or a Laker for life? By David DuPree, USA TODAY sent shockwaves through the NBA on Wednesday when he said in a radio interview he wanted to be traded from the Los Angeles Lakers. Reverberations continued even after the league's biggest star said later in another ESPN Radio interview he wanted to retire as a Laker. Audio of interview; Kobe's blog shows change of heart David DuPree assesses Kobe situation in chat transcript Bryant said the Lakers misled him about building an elite team and he no longer trusts them. On his website, he said he was frustrated by a newspaper report that said he was behind "That place is a mess," Bryant said, referring to the Lakers' front office. "If we're not making strides here to improve this team right now, to be aggressive in that nature, then what's the point of having me here? "I would like to be traded, yeah," continued Bryant, who has led the league in scoring the last two seasons. "Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative. It's rough man, but I don't see how you can rebuild that trust." In response to Bryant's trade talks, Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss issued the following statement: "We are aware of the media reports. However, Kobe has not told us directly that he wants to be traded. We have made it very clear that we are building our team around Kobe and that we intend for him to be a Laker his entire career. "We will speak directly to Kobe, and until we do that, we will not comment publicly about this." The two sides have a lot to discuss, as Bryant seemed to allow room for reconciliation after talking to Lakers coach Phil Jackson. "When Phil and I spoke, he was optimistic and determined that we'll both be back," Bryant told ESPN Radio. "Phil is somebody I listen to. I lean on him a lot. He assured me things are going to be OK. Things are going to be all right. &#8230; Which was very encouraging. I don't want to go anywhere else. I want to be here for the rest of my career." Feelings built up for Bryant: 's best explanation of the roller-coaster-like ride he led the Los Angeles Lakers on begins with feeling betrayed by the team. Bryant wrote on his website that he became infuriated Tuesday when the Los Angeles Times quoted "a Lakers insider" saying it was Bryant's insistence on not wanting to play any longer with that prompted the center's trade to the Miami Heat. That report, combined with his feeling that the Lakers were not building a contender, led to him saying Wednesday he wanted to be traded. Hours later he said he hoped something could be worked out. The Lakers haven't made a major trade, had a significant free agent signing or scored a draft coup since the O'Neal trade. After winning 20 playoff series and three NBA championships from 2000 to 2004, they have won only four postseason games in the last three years. They finished seventh in the Western Conference the last two seasons and were eliminated by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the playoffs both times. "Kobe is a very competitive guy and a team guy, but he wants to win," said Jack Ramsay, an ESPN analyst. "It would be a rarity for a team with that composition of players (Lakers current roster) to be a contending team. They're doing as well as they can by making the playoffs and taking Phoenix to seven games last year, which is commendable." Bryant wrote on his website Wednesday that Lakers owner Jerry Buss told him O'Neal was being traded for financial reasons and because of O'Neal's declining skills. Bryant was adamant that he had nothing to do with O'Neal's leaving and said he could no longer trust the team. "The more I thought about the future, the more I became convinced that the Lakers and me just have two different visions for the future," Bryant wrote. "The Lakers are pursuing a longer-term plan that is different from what Dr. Buss shared with me at the time I re-signed as a free agent. "I have seen that plan unfold for the last three years and watched great trade opportunities come and go and have seen free agents passed on. That has led to the Lakers not winning a playoff series. "All of that was frustrating in itself, but then this week to have someone 'inside' the Laker organization try to blame me in the media for us not being a contender right now &#8212; that is what brought me to my current position today." If Bryant, who turns 29 in August, goes on the trading block (he has a no-trade option in his contract, which means he can refuse any deal if it isn't to a team of his liking), it could cause a feeding frenzy. Ramsay says it's possible Bryant could still be traded. "I read in the Dallas paper Tuesday, the headline on the sports page was, 'Go for Kobe, and if it takes Dirk, it's worth it,' " Ramsay said. "That's a huge, huge statement. But I think teams will think in that direction. He's an amazing player, and there aren't any quite like him." Bryant was the only player in the league to average at least 30 points (31.6) and was an All-NBA first-team and NBA all-defensive first-team selection. Bryant has spent his entire 11-year NBA career with the Lakers. Only one active player, and his 12 seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves, has a longer tenure with one team. Three significant issues face any team looking to acquire : salary-cap limitations, who they are willing to give up and what it would do to team chemistry. Here are five possible front-runners (in order of likelihood): &#8212; The Knicks need a star to return the thrill to Madison Square Garden. Money is no object, and they have the players to give up to make a deal work, such as center &#8212; The Bulls have plenty of young talent to offer, but they may have their sights set on the Minnesota Timberwolves' . They'll have salary cap space. Unwilling to part with small forward in a possible deal for , they may do it to get Bryant. Also to offer: shooting guard &#8212; Owner Mark Cuban is still smarting from the Mavericks' first-round ouster and may feel a need to get into the Kobe sweepstakes and keep MVP , though the Los Angeles Lakers would almost certainly demand him. A package of guard might pique the Lakers' interest. &#8212; Clearly rebuilding, the Bobcats have good young players (Raymond Felton, calling the shots, Bryant knows everything would be done to get the right pieces around him. &#8212; A homecoming might be attractive to Bryant. The 76ers, with three first-round picks in next month's draft and small forward and rising young star , have plenty of pieces to entice the Lakers.

The Astros try to avoid matching the longest losing streak in franchise history when they conclude their three-game home set with the Cincinnati Reds on Thursday night. Cincinnati (21-33) owns the worst record in the NL, but Houston (21-31) is closing in on that dubious distinction after dropping the first two games of this series. Wednesday night's 4-3 defeat was the 10th in a row for the Astros - their longest skid since dropping a franchise-record 11 straight from Aug. 17-28, 1995. Poor hitting has been the biggest reason for the Astros' latest slump. Houston has scored only 20 total runs in the 10 defeats, while batting .216 overall and .193 with runners in scoring position. ''I don't ever remember it being quite this bad,'' Astros manager Phil Garner said. ''This is getting borderline stupid, too. We stung the ball really well and got nothing for it. Guys went to the plate and just didn't get anything.'' The Astros will try to get their offense back on track against struggling Cincinnati starter Bronson Arroyo (2-5, 4.01 ERA). In each of his last two starts, Arroyo has given up four runs in the first inning while letting the opposition bat around. The right-hander walked five batters and hit another while throwing a whopping 82 pitches in the two opening frames, demonstrating a puzzling lack of command for a pitcher who had yielded three earned runs or fewer in his previous eight starts. ''I don't know,'' catcher David Ross said as he tried to explain why Arroyo is scuffling. ''I wish I had the answers. He 's not getting the pitches he wants over for strikes. He's getting behind in the count, and when he does get ahead, he's not putting guys away. ''It's one of those things where you turn around and you don't really know what happened.'' Arroyo has pitched well in two starts against Houston this season, going 1-0 while allowing only three runs and eight hits over 14 innings. He earned the win at Minute Maid Park on May 1, when he yielded one run and three hits over seven innings of Cincinnati's 11-2 victory. The Astros also send a slumping pitcher to the mound in Woody Williams (1-7, 5.65). The 40-year-old right-hander and Houston native signed with the team last fall, but his return to his hometown has not gone well. Williams has received three or fewer runs of support in 10 of his 11 outings, but that is not entirely to blame for his poor record. He has allowed opponents to bat .293 against him this season, and is 0-2 with a 7.31 ERA and five home runs allowed over his last three outings. On Friday, Williams lasted only five innings and gave up four runs in a 13-3 loss at Arizona. Reds right fielder Ken Griffey Jr. has had great success against Williams, hitting .382 (13-for-34) with five homers, eight walks and a .500 on-base percentage versus the right-hander. Griffey went 1-for-4 with an RBI double Wednesday, snapping a stretch of four games without driving in a run.

Click me to Baseball roundup: Tuesday's action on the diamonds Pittsburgh Pirates' Freddie Sanchez, right, is tagged out by San Diego Padres second baseman Oscar Robles as he tries to advance to second after hitting an RBI single in the third inning of the baseball game in Pittsburgh, Tuesday. (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic) Published: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 (CP) - Jason Bay followed up his award-winning week with another big game. Hours after being named the National League's player of the week, the native of Trail, B.C., had two hits, including his eighth homer, in the Pittsburgh Pirates' 4-1 win over the San Diego Padres on Tuesday. It was Bay's hit his third homer in his past five games. He's 12-for-24 with three home runs and 11 RBIs in his past seven games. And with the Pirates winning, his recent excellent play means that much more. "A lot of times in the past you go on a little hot streak, and it doesn't mean as much because you're not winning," Bay said. "This has coincided with us winning so I think it means a little bit more." Elsewhere in the NL it was: Arizona 11 Philadelphia 5, Los Angeles 10 Washington 0, New York 5 San Francisco 4 (12 innings), Florida 9 Chicago 4, Cincinnati 2 Houston 1, Milwaukee 5 Atlanta 4 and Colorado 8 St. Louis 3. At Pittsburgh, Tom Gorzelanny lowered his ERA to 2.39 after overcoming a shaky first inning. Bay acknowledged that the left-hander is Pittsburgh's leader on the mound. "I'm not going to say he came out of nowhere," Bay said, "but he's our bona fide guy right now. He's our stopper. It's nice to have that guy that goes out there every single day and you're thinking he's going to throw a gem and give you a chance to win." Josh Bard went 3-for-4 and Jose Cruz had two hits for the Padres, who had won three in a row and six of seven. Gorzelanny (6-3) scattered seven hits while allowing the one run, striking out four and walking three as the Pirates won for the fourth time in five games. Gorzelanny allowed only eight earned runs in his six starts in May. "I'm still a long ways from being established," said Gorzelanny, who is in his second full season in the majors. "And I'm just going to go out there, do my thing, work hard. I know there's still a lot of things I have to work on, especially with my pitch count." That negative aspect of his game was on display in the first inning, when Gorzelanny threw 34 pitches and loaded the bases before escaping unscathed. "He showed tremendous signs of a very mature guy out there," Pirates manager Jim Tracy said. "In the first inning of the game it looks like 'How far are we going to be able to get with him with 34 pitches in the first inning?' He just kept battling. This guy finds ways. "He kept getting better as the night goes on." The only run he allowed was a sacrifice fly by Termel Sledge that scored Kevin Kouzmanoff in the sixth. Other than the first inning, he twice stranded runners at second base. The last batter Gorzelanny faced was Adrian Gonzalez, with a runner on and two outs in the seventh. Gorzelanny struck him out with his 120th pitch. "You've got to give credit to their guy," San Diego manager Bud Black said. "He wobbled a little bit but made a couple of pitches that get them out of the inning. A hit in that inning with a couple of guys on would have been nice but Gorzelanny hung in there and made some pitches.

Either that or baseball fans in Houston are in for a long, miserable summer at the ballpark. The season slipped a little closer toward becoming a certified disaster Wednesday night when the Astros again struggled to score and plunged to their 10th consecutive loss, 4-3 to the Cincinnati Reds at Minute Maid Park. The defeat dropped the Astros (21-31) to 10 games under .500 and one game ahead of the last-place Reds in the National League Central. It's their longest losing streak since they dropped a club-record 11 consecutive games from Aug. 17-28, 1995. "That's how many? Ten? And really in crappy fashion," manager Phil Garner said. "We have not hit the ball. We went a bunch of times without scoring runs when (Roger Clemens) was pitching, and I called that stupid, but this is bordering on stupid now, too. This is really ridiculous." The Astros have given up more runs (72) during their losing streak than they have hits (71). They managed just six hits, including two doubles, against Reds starter Aaron Harang, who needed only 105 pitches to throw his ninth career complete game. Harang retired 14 in a row in one stretch and sent down the final six batters he faced, retiring the Astros in order on seven pitches in the ninth. "It's a pretty frustrating time for us," said second baseman Craig Biggio, who made two errors. "I've seen a couple of guys struggle a little bit, but not as many as we have right now, and that's frustrating. We need to get this monkey off our back and get a 'W' and hopefully get more guys contributing and pitching in and doing the little things to win baseball games." The Astros fell behind 3-0 in the first inning before many in the crowd of 31,904 had found their seats. Considering how poorly the offense has been performing, the hopes for a comeback were bleak. Somehow, the players remain positive. "I'm coming out each day more and more fired up," third baseman Morgan Ensberg said. "I recognize this is a flat-out dogfight, this is a battle, and I refuse to give in. I'm not going to lie down. I'm going to go out there and do absolutely everything I can to do something positive." The first three Reds hitters reached and scored against Astros starter Wandy Rodriguez (2-5), who labored through five innings. Norris Hopper doubled and scored on Alex Gonzalez's single, and Ken Griffey Jr. drove home Gonzalez with a double and scored on Adam Dunn's single to make it 3-0. "I started really rough, but I tried to fight back and keep the game close so we could tie it," Rodriguez said. "The first inning I had a few bad pitches, but I came back and was able to hit my spots." Carlos Lee recorded his 46th RBI of the season in the bottom of the first with a double to score Ensberg. Cincinnati took a 4-1 lead in the sixth when Hopper scored from first on a Gonzalez double, though it appeared shortstop Adam Everett had a shot to throw him out at the plate with his relay throw. "I was a little surprised," Garner said. "I thought we were going to get him." Harang (6-2) had retired 14 in a row, including striking out the side in the fifth, before Lee led off the seventh with a single. Hunter Pence reached on an error, and Everett singled to center one out later to score Lee and get the Astros within 4-2. But the Astros couldn't get closer in the inning as pinch hitters Mike Lamb and Orlando Palmeiro both popped out to short. The Astros sliced the deficit to 4-3 in the eighth. Biggio led off with a double to right — his 2,974th career hit — and scored on Berkman's sizzling grounder to short that Gonzalez was surprisingly able to stop. That was one of three balls the Astros struck hard late in the game but right at Reds defenders. "Every night I come to the ballpark thinking this is the night we're going to throw together 20 hits and 55 runs, and sooner or later you're going to catch up," Garner said. "We played things aggressively during the game. We've done it all year, no different than we've done in this stretch. We've tried to play aggressive, and it hasn't worked for us. There's nothing else we could have done tonight."

Owner Craig Leipold has signed a letter of intent to sell the Predators to Canadian billionaire Jim Balsillie, a deal with a closing date of June 30. The National Hockey League's free-agent window opens the very next day. Email to a friend Nashville has seven players set to become unrestricted free agents, including captain Kimmo Timonen and forwards Paul Kariya and Peter Forsberg. The NHL's board of governors still has to approve the sale, leaving players and agents in need of answers from the team and general manager David Poile. "I don't think the league wants David Poile to hit July 1 not knowing who his owner is and not knowing what direction it's going to go in," Timonen's agent, Bill Zito, said yesterday. "We have a 100-point team, and now, all of the sudden, it's going to disintegrate because of the timing of legalities? That doesn't make any sense." Poile and Leipold both declined interview requests yesterday. Poile was said to be awaiting direction. Rumours have swirled around the franchise since Balsillie's purchase agreement was announced last week. There has been talk the Predators could move to Winnipeg, Hamilton or to Balsillie's base near Waterloo -- talk that will likely continue despite NHL commissioner Gary Bettman's claim on Monday that it "is not going anywhere." "I know if I was a free agent thinking about signing that would be the first question I'd be asking," Nashville centre Jason Arnott told The Tennessean. The Predators were already going to face a challenge in resigning at least a couple of their marquee names, especially Timonen, who is primed for the largest payday of his career after registering at least 40 points for the fifth straight year. The 32-year-old defenceman made US$2.28-million last season, but is thought to be looking at the deal fellow defenceman Andrei Markov signed with the Montreal Canadiens on Monday as comparable. Markov signed a four-year contract reported to be worth US$23-million. Forsberg is also weighing his options. "He's had all these health issues for a couple of years," agent Don Baizley said yesterday. "And he's got to, first of all, find out whether they can be resolved to the point that he can play at the level he expects of himself. And I don't think that's a decision that he's going to make any time soon." Baizley did say his clients -- Forsberg and Kariya -- would also want to know about Nashville's situation. "I really think it's going to be business as usual," NHL player agent Allan Walsh said. "I don't feel that the sale is going to impact much on players' decisions to sign there, one way or the other. Management has been very stable and very consistent over the years and if you listen to what is being said on the NHL side, and on the ownership side, it does not appear that franchise move is imminent."

Briefing Room 2007 NFL Draft order NFL Hall of Fame Mavs' owner Cuban says pro football demand is greater than supply Updated: May 31, 2007, 1:03 AM ET owner Mark Cuban is part of a group considering formation of a football league that would compete with the NFL for players drafted lower than the second round. The league, still very much in the preliminary stage, would play its games on Friday nights. The NFL does not play then because of the potential conflict with high school football. "It's a pretty simple concept," Cuban said in an e-mail to The Associated Press. "We think there is more demand for pro football than supply." It's a pretty simple concept. We think there is more demand for pro football than supply. The proposal was first disclosed by The New York Times on its Web site, which said it was the idea of Bill Hambrecht, a Wall Street investor who was a minority partner in the Oakland Invaders of the USFL, which played in the spring from 1983-85. Sharon Smith, a spokeswoman for Hambrecht and Company, had no comment and said Hambrecht was traveling and unavailable to talk about the idea. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said he was aware of the proposed league, but had no further comment. On his blog, Cuban explained how the new league, dubbed the UFL, would actually be good for the NFL. "The NFL wants and needs competition," Cuban wrote. "They have grown so big and powerful that every move they make is scrutinized by local or federal officials. A competitor allows them to point to us and explain that their moves are for competitive reasons rather than the move of a monopoly." There have been numerous leagues that have tried to compete with the NFL and a few that actually played games, starting with the AFL, which began in 1960 and fully merged with the NFL a decade later. It included such current franchises as New England, Oakland, Kansas City, San Diego, Buffalo, the New York Jets and Denver. More recently came the World Football League in the early 1970s, which raided the NFL for such stars as Larry Csonka. Then came the USFL, which played in the spring before folding after receiving only $3 in an antitrust "victory" over the NFL. The USFL featured such future Hall of Famers as Jim Kelly, Reggie White and Steve Young, but lost millions of dollars trying to compete for players. It also had internal struggles among a majority of owners who wanted to stay in the spring, and the best known among them, Donald Trump, who wanted to move to the fall and try to force a merger with the NFL. The most recent pro football league was the XFL, founded by the World Wrestling Federation and televised by NBC. The XFL lasted just three months in the spring of 2001 and was best known for a player named Rod Smart, called "He Hate Me," who later played as a return man and backup running back in the NFL. So far, the proposed new league is in its infancy and Cuban is the only potential owner for what the founders hope will be an eight-team league. Cuban said in his e-mail he believes the salary cap makes it easier to compete financially with the NFL because of the salary imbalance that leaves lower-level players with lower salaries. That would allow the new league to fill its rosters with players taken lower than the second round, as well as late NFL cuts and free agents who escape the NFL draft. Many such players, including , a sixth-round pick of New England, have become NFL stars. "That's not to say it will be easy. It won't," Cuban wrote. "We still have to cover quite a bit of ground and have a lot of milestones to hit. That said, if we can get the right owners I obviously think we can make this work." The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The senate is expected approve a bill that would lift long-time restrictions on reselling tickets to sporting events, concerts and shows. The state Assembly has already voted for the bill, which could be signed into law tomorrow, when the state's old anti-scalping law expires. Under the proposed rules, the state would stop capping prices for tickets sold on the secondary market. Scalpers would still be banned from selling tickets within 1,500 feet of large arenas. But for the first time, it would be entirely legal for average fans to scalp their seats on the Internet.

(AP) - Kentucky Derby winner Street Sense will skip the Belmont Stakes so trainer Carl Nafzger can prepare his colt for the Travers Stakes and Breeders' Cup Classic later this year. Nafzger said he talked to owner James Tafel for two hours Wednesday night before deciding against a rematch with Preakness winner Curlin in the final leg of the Triple Crown. "The competitive side said 'Go,' the logical side said 'No, no, no,"' Nafzger said. Nafzger said they will aim toward the summer and fall schedule that features the Travers and Breeders' Cup. "Mr. Tafel said let's not chase spilled water," Nafzger said. "We spilled our water during the Preakness. We got beat. We got outran." Street Sense and jockey Calvin Borel appeared headed to the Belmont to chase the Triple Crown when he took the lead deep in the stretch at the Preakness, only to have Curlin and jockey Robby Albarado slip by at the wire. So with the opportunity of being the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978 gone, Tafel wants his colt to chase the possibility of becoming the first horse to win the Derby, the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, the Travers and the Breeders' Cup Classic. The Travers is Aug. 25 at Saratoga. The Breeders' Cup Classic is Oct. 27 at Monmouth Park. Nafzger said there was a concern that Street Sense wouldn't have time to get properly prepared for the Travers if he ran the 1Â½-mile Belmont. The horse will be able to rest and compete in one or two races between now and the Travers, including possibly the Jim Dandy. "I know there's disappointment we're not going to the Belmont," Nafzger said. "But somewhere we want to make another stand." Â© The Canadian Press, 2007 Letters to the Editor

NASCAR considering changing testing rules NASCAR seems to be rethinking its testing policy according to an Associate Press . Whether it has anything to do with Goodyear's asking or Roush's complaints really doesn't matter, they have obviously realized that teams are getting around their testing rules and want to do something about it. "It appears that we've got teams that want to test more and teams that want to test less, and teams that test on tires that are not made by our tire supplier," Robin Pemberton, NASCAR vice president of competition, told The Associated Press on Wednesday. "So we're going to start looking at a lot of different things, from eventually lifting the test ban completely, or get as restrictive as we cannot let teams test anywhere at any time, or land somewhere in between." I guess the biggest question will be, which direction will NASCAR go? They came up with the testing rule to supposedly help the smaller teams compete against the larger teams that have more money to spend on testing, but the larger teams have obviously found a way around it and still be within the rules. They are not buying tires from Goodyear and they are testing at non-NASCAR sanctioned tracks, something NASCAR has no control over. They could lift the testing rules completely and allow the teams to test at any track they want, any time and use Goodyear tires. They could add more testing dates to the schedule. Or, they could become even more restrictive and make the teams sign a contract with NASCAR that they cannot test anywhere except at the NASCAR sponsored test sessions or use any other tires other than Goodyear. It's difficult to say which way NASCAR will go with this. Hopefully they'll take input from teams to see what they think and actually take what they say into consideration before making a decision.

Kotschau has played in 224 games - starting 202 - for the Chicago Fire, Tampa Bay Mutiny, Colorado Rapids and Columbus Crew. He won an MLS Cup title in 1998 with the expansion Fire. He started 23 of 26 games for Columbus last year, contributing one goal and two assists. He has 10 goals and 17 assists in his career. Kotschau was awarded to Real after clearing waivers Tuesday, months after being picked by Toronto FC in the expansion draft. "Ritchie is a player that brings us a great deal of depth defensively," RSL Technical Director John Ellinger said. "He's a very, very smart soccer player - there are few, if any, situations he has not been in. He's comfortable on the ball in the back and should mesh well with the personalities on our squad.

When the wave began circling the arena minutes later, it was clear that delirium had taken hold of the city. Skip to next paragraph Tony Parker, shooting past Deron Williams, had 21 points, including an early burst that set the tone for the Spurs. They have grown accustomed to hoisting championship banners here, and the mere anticipation of another one had fans ready to do the river dance across the Riverwalk. The Spurs crushed the , 109-94, on Wednesday to win the Western Conference finals in five games. is now four victories away from claiming his fourth championship in nine years. "It feels great to be back," Duncan said. Duncan, who led the team to titles in 1999, 2003 and 2005, was at his casually dominant best Wednesday night, with an effortless 21 points in 28 minutes. Tony Parker, a member of the last two title teams, had 21 points, including a first-quarter burst that set the tone for the night. The Spurs now have a week to prepare for either the , who are tied at two games apiece in the Eastern Conference finals. The finals open here next Thursday. Aside from a 26-point rout in Game 3, the Jazz — a team of mostly postseason neophytes — had a tough time matching the Spurs' ferocity and focus. They trailed for all 48 minutes Wednesday, falling behind by double digits in the first 8 minutes of the game. The deficit was 19 points by the second quarter. The Jazz never got closer than 16 in the second half. "They came at us really hard," Utah Coach Jerry Sloan said, "and we lost faith as far as anything we wanted to do. They destroyed our will to want to play." Deron Williams' playoff coming-out party ended with a thud. Limited by injury (a sprained foot) and foul trouble, Williams scored just 11 points and had 2 assists in 23 minutes. His pick-and-roll partner, power forward Carlos Boozer, also fizzled with the season on the line, finishing with 9 points. A pair of rising stars, Boozer and Williams also ended the night furious with their teammates. Without naming individuals, they accused some players of giving up. "It is sad to say that," Boozer said, "because where we are, we are in the Western Conference finals, and we have guys that have vacation plans." There were several possible culprits. Gordan Giricek scored just 5 points in 21 minutes, and none in the first half. Center Mehmet Okur, a key scorer all season but a no-show in this round, had 8 points and 3 rebounds. Andrei Kirilenko, the starting small forward, had 13 points and 5 rebounds. "There are definitely some guys not on the same page," Williams said. Williams spent the final 9 minutes 25 seconds of the third quarter on the bench with four fouls. Boozer was out for the final 5:06 of the period, also with four fouls. The Spurs' lead grew from 16 to 27 after Williams sat down. Despite the stakes, Sloan did not put either of his young stars back in the game until the start of the fourth quarter, with the Jazz trailing by 83-56. So Utah's surprising, occasionally thrilling playoff ride came to an end. The Jazz had not been to the playoffs in four years and were not expected to make it this far. But with Williams and Boozer developing into a dominant young tandem, Utah should be playing in May for many years to come. "We're still young and we're still learning, but that's no excuse," Williams said. "Some guys need to find where their heart's at." The Jazz was missing a key starter at tip-off — guard Derek Fisher was en route from New York, where he had taken his 11-month-old daughter for a doctor's appointment. Tatum Fisher is being treated for a rare form of cancer in her left eye. The last time Fisher made the trip to New York with Tatum, on May 9, he arrived back in Salt Lake City just in time to rally the Jazz to a victory over the Golden State Warriors in Game 2 of the conference semifinals. By the time Fisher jogged onto the court at halftime, at about 9:24 p.m. Central time, Utah trailed by 16 points. The Jazz certainly needed a jolt of inspiration, or whatever Fisher could provide. He missed his first attempt, a 3-pointer from the left side, and did not score in the third quarter. Giricek replaced Fisher in the starting lineup and went scoreless in the first half. The reserve guard Dee Brown also stepped in and scored just 1 point, as the Jazz fell behind by as many as 23 points. Parker had 11 points in the first 10 minutes of the game, matching the output of the entire Jazz starting lineup in the first quarter. Williams, who found stardom in this postseason, could not match Parker's frantic production. He had 7 points and 3 fouls in the first half. Utah, in many respects a younger, less-seasoned version of the business-like Spurs, made a strong impression in this postseason. The Spurs provided one tough lesson after another about what it takes to get to the top. "I have tremendous respect for this team, as long as they have Duncan and Popovich and those people," Sloan said before the game. "You know, they get everything going with the players they have. I thought they would be awfully difficult to play against." Next Article in Sports (6 of 27) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18961884/&cid Mickelson quits Memorial with wrist injury - Golf - MSNBC.com Mickelson quits Memorial with wrist injury Star won't duel Tiger, hopes to be ready for U.S. Open in two weeks Terry Gilliam / AP Jim Weathers, right, massages Phil Mickelson's left wrist on the 11th hole during the first round. DUBLIN, Ohio - The looming duel between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson at the Memorial Tournament disappeared before Woods even hit his first shot: Mickelson withdrew with an injured left wrist after 11 holes. Mickelson was intent on challenging Woods, who had yet to tee off, at Muirfield Village Golf Club. â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s anything serious but it just got worse. I couldnâ€™t grab the club and I couldnâ€™t swing,â€ said Mickelson, who was 2 over through 11 holes before returning to the clubhouse. â€œI hit a wedge on 2 and it got really aggravated.â€ Earlier this week Mickelson, second on the money list to Woods, played at Oakmont, site of the U.S. Open in two weeks. That is where he apparently injured his wrist, although the couldnâ€™t remember precisely when he first hurt it. â€œI was hitting a lot of chip shots out of the rough at Oakmont and I think that kind of aggravated it. I hit some drivers today and it started hurting a little bit, but nothing I didnâ€™t think I could handle,â€ he said. â€œWhen I hit a wedge on 2 (on Thursday), it shot up my arm and it was OK. I kind of half-clubbed it around. The 5 iron on 4 really hurt. It just got worse.â€ Mickelson said he would ice his wrist, see a doctor and could possibly play as soon as next weekâ€™s stop in Memphis. But getting ready for the Open takes precedence over that. â€œThe U.S. Open is more of what weâ€™re gearing up for, as much as Iâ€™d love to play here and as excited as I was to play here and get back into the swing of it, I couldnâ€™t swing,â€ he said. The pain got to be too much after he hit his approach to the green on the par-5 11th hole. ALSO ON THIS STORY Leaderboard from Memorial Tournament Discuss: Sound off on golf message boards â€œThe wedge shot on 11 out of the divot jarred it pretty good,â€ Mickelson said. â€œI just didnâ€™t feel like I could hit a shot on 12.â€ Mickelsonâ€™s withdrawal erased one of the major storylines at the Memorial â€” Mickelsonâ€™s challenge to Woods. Woods is No. 1 by acclaim, not even close. But that doesnâ€™t stop everybody from trying to speculate about who could sneak up and steal his crown. Ask the golf expert: Jim McCabe Fatherhood won't slow Tiger â€œIâ€™ve had different guys make different runs,â€ Woods said after Wednesdayâ€™s pro-am at Muirfield Village Golf Club. â€œIt was (David) Duval and then probably Phil and Ernie (Els), Vijay (Singh), Goose (Retief Goosen) â€” a combination of those guys throughout the years.â€ With Mickelson coming off a big win at The Players Championship three weeks ago, some were saying he was primed to challenge Woods at the Memorial and then in two weeks at the U.S. Open at Oakmont. It seems that every time Mickelson gets a big win â€” the Masters in 2004, the PGA Championship in 2005, the Masters again in 2006 â€” it gets Woodsâ€™ attention. A year ago, for instance, Mickelson won at Augusta and was in position to take his third major in a row before hitting that hideous drive on the final hole that cost him the Open at Winged Foot. Still grieving the loss of his father, Woods wasnâ€™t a factor there, but then turned around and won the last two majors, the British Open and PGA. With Woods facing impending fatherhood and the changes that can bring, now could be the time for someone to finally challenge for the top spot in the world. Slide show: Week in Sports Pictures Week in Sports Pictures Sports fans riot and show their elfin side, while flips, turns and wipeouts punctuate motor sports this week. Woods doesnâ€™t seem to be conceding anything, though. â€œAs long as Iâ€™m up there in the conversation, Iâ€™m doing all right,â€ Woods said. â€œI keep pushing myself pretty hard, regardless. I always try and get better. You canâ€™t stay stagnant in any sport. Youâ€™ve always got to keep getting better because you know the guys are training harder, theyâ€™re finding their game, theyâ€™re in the gym, youâ€™re getting better athletes playing the game. So youâ€™ve got to keep getting better.â€ Even without Mickelson, the field mirrors that of a major. Nine of the top 10 money-winners are on hand, along with former Memorial winners Els, Jim Furyk, Singh, Tom Lehman and Paul Azinger. Masters champion Zach Johnson, still on a victory lap after winning the Masters in April and the AT&T Classic two weeks ago, burns to remain in such elite company. â€œThis is one of my favorite places to be,â€ said Johnson, who tied for second at the Memorial a year ago, two shots behind winner Carl Pettersson. â€œGolfwise, I absolutely love it. If you find a complaint here, itâ€™s hard.â€ ALSO ON THIS STORY Leaderboard from Memorial Tournament Discuss: Sound off on golf message boards Â© 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Spurs will play either the Detroit Pistons or the Cleveland Cavaliers in the finals, which start on June 7 in San Antonio. The Pistons and Cavaliers are tied 2-2 in the eastern conference finals. San Antonio was leading Utah 16-11 in the first period when they embarked on a streak that set the tone for the game. Parker scored seven consecutive points to push the advantage to 23-11. Bruce Bowen connected on a three-pointer before Parker drove for another basket and in less than three minutes, the Spurs had a 19-point lead. "Tonight we played great, everybody from the starting five, from the bench, everybody made shots," Parker said. "I think we won that game in the first quarter, and we kept the lead the whole game." The Spurs, who have defeated the Jazz 19 consecutive times in San Antonio, led 34-15 after the first quarter and 55-39 at the half. That advantage grew to 83-56 going into the fourth. Andrei Kirilenko led the Jazz with 13 points. Deron Williams, who played with a sprained left foot, and Matt Harpring had 11 each. Carlos Boozer was held to nine points and 12 rebounds. Guard Derek Fisher missed the first half while returning from New York, where is daughter is being treated for an eye condition. He was 0-3 from the floor. The finals will be the Spurs' fourth appearance in nine seasons. They won the NBA title in 1999, 2003 and 2005, but lost in the second round of the 2004 play-offs and the western conference semi-finals in 2006. They have seven days to prepare for another tilt at the title. When you see news happening: SMS/MMS: 0406 THE AGE (0406 843 243), or us.

A-Rod proves he's only human Posted: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 11:47 AM A-Rod went out on a date in Toronto, and if it helps his hitting, Iâ€™m sure every Yankee fan with the exception of his wife will be delighted. If it doesnâ€™t, theyâ€™ll also be delighted, because nothing promotes the circulation like a salacious story about a superstar. Iâ€™ve got mixed feelings on this one. The strongest is the customary feeling of delicious revulsion I get so often when reading what passes in The New York Post for front-page news. The other is something approaching empathy for the guy who was caught being human for one of the few times in his life. This stuff has no place in a newspaper. I really believe that. A-Rod is a wealthy star, but I donâ€™t think that means his private life should be fodder for the tabloids. If he were a public figure, itâ€™s a different story, especially if it were an elected official who lectures the rest of us on how to live a moral life. But A-Rod is just a ballplayer. Believe it or not, other married ballplayers see women who arenâ€™t their wives when theyâ€™re on the road. There was a famous quote about that in Jim Boutonâ€™s famous tell-all book, As the Yankees were getting off the plane after a road trip and preparing to meet their wives, who were lined up at the gate, somebody â€“ probably Mickey Mantle â€“ said, â€œAll right, guys. Look horny.â€ Whatever morals are involved are strictly individual. For the ballplayers â€“ and others who travel for a living â€“ itâ€™s nothing personal. The great majority of the ballplayers who cheat actually adore their wives. What theyâ€™re doing has nothing to do with romance or even emotion. Itâ€™s strictly something to do to ease the tension, pass the time, and inflate their egos. The wonder isnâ€™t that some guys are unfaithful in a sporting kind of way but that all of them arenâ€™t. But even if you are able to ignore the moral judgments of others, you canâ€™t ignore A-Rodâ€™s wife. His daughter is two and a half, too young to know anything. But his wife has just been humiliated in public. If A-Rod did anything that can be considered morally wrong in an absolute sense, thatâ€™s it. If you have to canoodle on the side, keep it out of the papers. In a perfect world, no one would care about such things and newspapers would have better things to report. But, as Al Gore has been pointing out while promoting his book, , America loves â€œtrivialities and nonsense "What is it about our collective decision-making process that has led us to this state of affairs where we spend much more time in the public forum talking about -- or receiving information about -- Britney Spears shaving her head or Paris Hilton going to jail?" he said at a New York book signing. Now, he might add, talking about A-Rodâ€™s busty gal pal. I donâ€™t know how the paparazzi and the tabloid writers sleep at night. Theyâ€™ve chosen to support themselves by embarrassing and humiliating others. read The Postâ€™s story , and you wonder if the author has to wear Depends while grinding out the copy. The folks at The Postâ€™s Page 6 must short out three keyboards a week with their drool. Hereâ€™s the real story: A-Rod went to dinner and a strip club with a blonde woman whose identity could not be determined. Afterwards, they went to his hotel and got in the elevator. Thatâ€™s it, folks. But to the Post, they didnâ€™t go to a restaurant but to a â€œpricey steakhouse.â€ It wasnâ€™t a strip joint, but a â€œglitzyâ€ strip club. The hotel in which he was staying was in a â€œposhâ€ section of town. He wasnâ€™t with a woman but with a â€œbusty blondeâ€ or a â€œbabe.â€ If you asked her what she wore, sheâ€™d probably say, â€œjeans and a t-shirt.â€ If you asked the Post, theyâ€™d tell you: â€œHis tight-bodied, bleach-blonde gal pal was clad in a snug pair of blue jeans, a shiny, light T-shirt and wedge-heeled shoes.â€ Since we donâ€™t know who the woman was â€“ it could have been his, um, â€œnieceâ€ or, ahem, â€œcousinâ€ â€“ in Post-speak, sheâ€™s a â€œmystery woman.â€ With everything thatâ€™s going on in the world, this occupied the Postâ€™s entire front page. With so many things to learn and know, the traffic on the paperâ€™s Web site has all but overwhelmed the servers. They report. You decide. Now that my spleen is properly vented, let me add that it is an encouraging sign. A-Rod has spent way too much time trying to be perfect. Heâ€™s a lot better off being just as flawed as the rest of us â€“ and admitting it. I feel sorry for his wife. No one deserves this. But if this somehow gets A-Rod off the perfect act and into some real human emotion, it might not be the worst thing that ever happened. Mike, I often disagree with your comments, but this time I completely agree with you. The fact that this information warranted an article on the front page is ludicrous. Hey, you're in the business....Anything for a good story right? For all we know they went their separate ways in their own rooms (kind of doubt it though). It's unfortunate that so many people thrive off of reading it. Regards, David David DiBona, Wayland, MA (Sent Wednesday, May 30, 2007 4:24 PM) Wow, Mike. Usually I'm with you but this post just comes across as way to supportive of A-Rod. You are right to say that he humiliated his wife, but I'm sure he also broke promises, and has or would have lied to her about it and to the public as well. If a man doesn't think he can commit to a wife, he should have one and shouldn't make vows to her.

Now, fellow car owner Bobby Ginn says he plans to build a NASCAR test track, probably a 11/2-miler, somewhere in South Carolina. And the new owners of Virginia International Raceway (VIR), the road course near Danville, are considering adding a flat track specifically for NASCAR&#8217;s Nextel Cup testing. It&#8217;s all in reaction to NASCAR&#8217;s testing rules, which limit the places at which stock-car teams can test as well as the tires they can test on, specifically, no 2007-model Goodyears. &#8220;Bobby wants to build either a 11/2-mile or two-mile track, with some banking on the high side and a flat track on the inside,&#8221; crew chief Richard &#8220;Slugger&#8221; Labbe said. &#8220;I told him, &#8216;Great!&#8217; But then I had to tell him about the tire situation - we can&#8217;t get any tires to test on. That floored him. But he said he&#8217;d start working on that, too.&#8221; NASCAR teams are upset about NASCAR&#8217;s testing rules, which have them scrambling for tires from Michelin&#8217;s B.F. Goodrich division and from Hoosier, because NASCAR won&#8217;t let Goodyear sell any tires to teams away from the official tour stops. At VIR this week, three big Michelin-logoed haulers brought in tires for NASCAR teams to test for Bruton Smith&#8217;s Sonoma race three weeks hence, a race that will feature NASCAR&#8217;s car of tomorrow, and played out in one of the country&#8217;s biggest markets, San Francisco. Jeff Gordon said he wasn&#8217;t pleased that NASCAR hadn&#8217;t scheduled a full-scale road-course test at VIR (about an hour north of Winston-Salem) with real Goodyear road-course tires and engineers. While most of the 24 teams testing at VIR had no old Goodyears to test on, Gordon and his teammates rubbed salt in those wounds by parading out 35 sets of Goodyears for their testing. Even Ford&#8217;s Jack Roush, who last week complained that all the teams testing on non-Goodyear tires were violating the spirit of NASCAR&#8217;s testing limits, finally relented and bought 50 sets of Goodrich tires for testing. Several crew chiefs said they were disappointed that neither NASCAR nor Goodyear even bothered sending anyone up to watch the testing. And this week, teams are sweating out the ill-handling car of tomorrow at Dover International Speedway, one of the tour&#8217;s toughest tracks on tires. NASCAR cancelled a major test two weeks ago at Dover because of the rainout at Darlington. So teams will be running the first few laps this week even more gingerly than usual. Toyota remains one of the big stories bubbling in the NASCAR garage, and it may be ready to make some big, bold moves for 2008, according to Detroit sources. Toyota, sources said, has approached the Gibbs team with a proposal to leave Chevrolet, which would give it Tony Stewart, Denny Hamlin and J.J. Yeley. Gibbs&#8217; management doesn&#8217;t appear to be that interested, but the offer hasn&#8217;t been rejected, according to team sources. Penske, who has been with just about every manufacturer in racing over the years and who is one of the world&#8217;s biggest Toyota dealers, could be making the move to Toyota for next year. According to sources close to the situation, Penske could be looking at a merger with Michael Waltrip&#8217;s struggling Toyota operation. And there is speculation that Robert and Doug Yates may be willing to listen to Toyota offers, even though they have long-standing ties with Ford.

What specific "Speculation" is Mickael talking about in regards to Robert Yates switching to Toyota? What is the difference between Mike writing that and me saying it? Nothing! Who are his sources? If you can't name them, don't write about it! Don't make this stuff up to fill a couple of pages! This story belongs in Star or the National Enquirer! Ken Toledo Posted on 05/31 at 04:03 AM If teams like Gibbs and Yates, and drivers like Tony Stewart, JJ Yeley, Rudd are with Toyota, there will be even less people interested in watching. It's obvious why the ratings are down.. people or someone continues to make undesirable changes in NASCAR that don't appeal to most race fans. If Dale Earnhardt Jr. leaves Chevy, and goes to Ford or Dodge, many fans will be unhappy, but life would go on. But Dale Earnhardt Jr. goes to Toyota, life will go on, but the world would go on upsidedown.

Chairman Bill Hambrecht plans to form a professional football league in North American cities where there are no National Football League teams. The United Football League would require a $30 million investment for each of eight initial franchises, and would sell shares in its teams that would be traded publicly, league spokesman Brian Fisher said. He declined to comment on other financial details. The 32-team NFL, which generates the highest television ratings of any U.S. sport, has crushed competitors before. Since agreeing to merge with the American Football League in 1966, three other challengers have folded: The World Football League played a full season in 1974 before shutting down the next year; the United States Football League lasted from 1983 to 1986; and the XFL closed in 2001 after one season. ``In can be very costly to penetrate this space,&#39;&#39; said David Carter, executive director of the University of Southern California Sports Business Institute. Carter said franchise owners might have to accept several years of losses before the league established itself. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello declined to comment. The league had revenue of about $6 billion last year, $3.73 billion from television alone. Mario Williams, the first pick in the league&#39;s 2006 draft, signed a six-year, $54 million contract that guaranteed him $26.5 million -- almost enough to buy a team in the new league. The rookie minimum salary last season was $275,000. Hambrecht, 71, who started his securities company in 1998, is founding the league with Tim Armstrong, vice president of advertising sales for Google Inc., and has hired Bill Daugherty, founder of Interactive Search Holdings and a former National Basketball Association vice president, Fisher said. Hambrecht helped persuade Google to use an Internet-based auction for its initial stock sale in 2004, rather than relying on banks to find buyers. The league, which hasn&#39;t decided where to locate teams, would begin play in August 2008 using rules similar to those in college and professional football. The first owner of a franchise is Mark Cuban, who owns the Dallas Mavericks of the NBA, Fisher said. The league would not compete with the NFL for top players, rather try to draw borderline players. Brad Blank, the Boston-based agent whose clients include New England Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi and Tennessee Titans receiver David Givens, said he would advise clients to consider a new league if the salaries were high enough to justify the physical risks of playing football. ``These days, I don&#39;t suggest someone goes out and does that for $25,000,&#39;&#39; he said. The formation of the new league was first reported on the New York Times&#39; Web site this morning.

I love it here.&#39;&#39; Bryant said he&#39;d spoken with Lakers coach Phil Jackson after telling ESPN Radio earlier today that he wanted to be traded. ``Phil told me they were determined to do something,&#39;&#39; Bryant told KLAC. ``I think my frustration would have been alleviated if they told me there was a long-term plan. It&#39;s not that they&#39;re incompetent; there was a long-term plan I knew nothing about.&#39;&#39; Bryant, 28, has complained since the Lakers were ousted by Phoenix in the first round of the NBA playoffs that the team hasn&#39;t brought in the type of players needed to win. In the interview with KLAC, Bryant said his agent Rob Pelinka had contacted Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak this morning and that he hadn&#39;t heard anything from team owner Jerry Buss, who put out a statement after the comments to ESPN saying he would speak with Bryant. ``We have made it very clear that we are building our team around Kobe and that we intend for him to be a Laker his entire career,&#39;&#39; Buss said in a statement. Pelinka didn&#39;t immediately return telephone calls seeking comment. In his interview with ESPN, Bryant said he saw ``no other alternative&#39;&#39; to a trade from the Lakers and that he wouldn&#39;t change his mind. He said he didn&#39;t have a preference on where he wanted to be traded, saying ``at this point, I&#39;ll go play on Pluto.&#39;&#39; Bryant, who teamed with Shaquille O&#39;Neal to win three championships with the Lakers from 2000-02, has four years remaining on the seven-year, $136 million contract he signed in 2004. A provision in the deal allows him to opt out after two more seasons. Bryant has criticized the Lakers&#39; organization in interviews the last two days, calling the team&#39;s front office a ``mess.&#39;&#39; On his Web site and in an interview yesterday with KLAC, he lashed out at a Los Angeles Times story that quoted a ``Lakers insider&#39;&#39; who said it was Bryant&#39;s desire to get away from O&#39;Neal that caused the team to trade the All-Star center. He also said Buss misled him when Bryant was mulling whether to stay with the team in 2004, telling him the Lakers would quickly try to return to championship form. The Lakers haven&#39;t won a playoff series since Bryant and O&#39;Neal led them to the 2004 NBA finals, where they lost to the Detroit Pistons in five games. O&#39;Neal was traded to Miami before the next season and Los Angeles missed the playoffs. The Lakers have finished seventh in the Western Conference the last two seasons, falling to Phoenix in the first round each time. Bryant has spent his entire 11-year career with the Lakers, averaging 24.6 points a game and leading the NBA in scoring the last two seasons, with 35.4 points in 2005-06 and 31.6 this year. He&#39;s made the All-NBA First Team four times and the All-Defensive team five times.

The UFL would be the latest in a series of leagues to compete with the NFL since the 1970s, including the World Football League, the United States Football League and most recently the XFL -- all of which failed. An NFL spokesman declined to comment. David Carter, executive director of the USC Sports Business Institute said the effort should not be dismissed, but it will be an uphill battle to establish the new league. "The NFL is clearly so very powerful that they've done a fantastic job of being able to fend off upstart leagues by ensuring that there are never enough open or underserviced markets available to make a start-up league successful," he said. "On the surface, if history tells us anything, it can't possibly work," Carter added. "But -- this is going to sound like Yogi Berra -- history was a long time ago and now the landscape has changed. The right people properly capitalized should never be taken for granted." Success for the UFL may not mean long-term existence as a league, but a place for some of its teams as expansion members in the NFL, Carter said. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

(AP) -- The Ducks are headed to Ottawa with history on their side. Anaheim's 1-0 victory Wednesday night gave the Ducks a commanding 2-0 lead in the Stanley Cup finals. Game 3 is Saturday in Ottawa. Of the 30 home clubs that won the first two games of the finals since the best-of-seven format began in 1939, 29 went on to win the Cup. The only team to win the championship after trailing 2-0 on the road was the 1971 Montreal Canadiens, who beat the Chicago Blackhawks in seven games. "We're excited to get back to our building," Ottawa's Joe Corvo said. "It's going to be loud and it's going to help us out." HOLD UP:@ Dany Heatley, like his teammates frustrated that Ottawa isn't generating more offense, said the Senators aren't used to seeing the Ducks' brand of defense. "They do a good job whether it's subtle or whether it's blatant," he said. "They definitely play a real hold-up defensive style. We have to find ways (to overcome it)." Isn't that style supposed to be against the rules now? "No question," Heatley said. SCORIN' SAMMY:@ Samuel Pahlsson's game-winning goal for Anaheim in the third period Wednesday was his second deciding one of the playoffs. He also had the game-winner in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals against Detroit. "The most important thing is to win the game, but of course, it's great to score the goal," Pahlsson said. The checking line of Pahlsson, Travis Moen and Rob Niedermayer has combined for five game-winning goals in the playoffs. Moen scored the game-winner in a 3-2 victory Monday in Game 1. Niedermayer has one game-winner. MAN-ADVANTAGE:@ For the second consecutive game, Ottawa had a two-man advantage and didn't score. Senators coach Bryan Murray credited Anaheim goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere for stopping his team. "We had four or five real good chances at the net. We jammed at it," Murray said. "He made two stops and then the puck came back to us again. We got another chance. That's what the game of hockey is. It's create and hope that you can get one by." CALIFORNIA DREAMIN':@ The Ducks' appearance marks the third time a California team has reached the Stanley Cup finals. The first two went home empty-handed. Anaheim took the 2003 finals to Game 7 before the New Jersey Devils captured the Cup. The Los Angeles Kings made it to the final round in 1993, but the Montreal Canadiens knocked them off in five games. The only team from the West Coast to win the Stanley Cup wasn't from California, or even the United States. The Victoria Cougars of the Western Canada Hockey League won it in 1925. There hasn't been a champion from the West Coast of any kind since Stanley Cup play was restricted to NHL teams. That was 80 years ago. DOWNSIZED:@ Goalies' equipment was downsized by the league a couple of years ago, and the Ducks' Jean-Sebastien Giguere said he learned to live with it. "My equipment is 14 percent smaller," he said. Some opponents in the past wondered whether Giguere, who tends to make most saves look routine, had pads that were larger than they were supposed to be. He said there's no way that would happen. "A company is just not allowed to send you equipment that's not legal, and it's got to go through the league before it gets to you," Giguere said. "We all play with the same equipment. So we are all in the same boat. "You have to pick equipment that's going to fit your style and how you play." NOTES:@ Anaheim improved to 11-2 in one-goal games in the playoffs, one short of the postseason record shared by the 2003 Ducks and the 1993 Montreal Canadiens. ... The announced crowd of 17,258 was the Ducks' 33rd consecutive sellout and included rapper Snoop Dogg and baseball Hall of Famer Dave Winfield. ... Anaheim has outshot the Senators 63-36 in the series' first two games. ... At 5-0, the Ducks are undefeated at home in the finals. They won each of their three home games against the New Jersey Devils in the 2003 finals, but lost the Cup in seven games. Get up to 50% off home delivery of the Chronicle for 12 weeks!

Jeff Cunningham shoots for three digits on his jersey for 2008 season May 31, 2007 04:30 AM Jeff Cunningham is stuck with number 93. He wears the number on his jersey, partly because he couldn't talk Jim Brennan into giving up his number 11. He also wears it because it matched his number of career goals when he was traded to Toronto FC last week. Cunningham assisted on Danny Dichio's goal in a 2-2 tie with Columbus last Saturday, but after failing to score on a pair of second-half breakaways, the fourth-ranked all-time scorer in the MLS heads into Saturday's game against Colorado still stalled on 93. "I'm not sharp in front of the goal, and I got two quality chances that normally I would have done better with," Cunningham said yesterday. "We walked away with a point instead of three." He last scored May 5, on a penalty kick against the New York Red Bulls. Most players don't sweat three goalless games â€“ Toronto's entire team didn't score until the season's fifth match â€“ but Cunningham's accustomed to finishing plays. He ranks third all-time in game-winning goals (28) and 10th in the league in scoring this year. So for Cunningham, this qualifies as a slump, and it's frustrating him. "As a striker we live by our performance, and scoring goals," says the 30-year-old. "When that's not going well we tend not to be the happiest people on the pitch." Like his moods, his jersey number depends on his scoring. The yearly number switch is now his routine, but it started as a coincidence. Growing up outside Tampa, Fla., he had always worn number 11, and it stuck with him for the first eight years of his MLS career. But when he was traded to Real Salt Lake before the 2006 season, another player had the number, so Cunningham switched to 74. It also equalled his career goal total at the time. "Seven plus four equals 11," he says. "I'm just keeping a little tally. I didn't think anyone else was (paying attention) but I'm trying to have a little fun with it and just enjoy the few years I have left playing." That season started with a slump worse than the one he's in now, going goalless in Real Salt Lake's first eight games. But by the end of the season, Cunningham had won the league's scoring title with 16 goals, and a new jersey number for 2007. When he came to Toronto last week he updated his number to reflect the three early season goals he scored with Salt Lake. For next season, Cunningham plans to petition FIFA and MLS to let him wear three digits on his jersey. Conrad Black on trial Great home delivery subscription deals here!

So it's hard to understand why the veteran car owner was so openly critical recently when discussing the issue of testing with the Car of Tomorrow, which NASCAR now says will be implemented full time for the 2008 season. Roush's five-car organization has been the only Ford outfit to go toe-to-toe with Chevrolet kingpins Hendrick Motorsports and Joe Gibbs Racing over the past seven years. But Roush says those teams -- as well as Richard Childress Racing -- have used extensive testing at nonsanctioned tracks to gain an advantage in competing with the newer, safer car. And that, he says, is wrong. NASCAR has limited testing at tracks that host Cup events for the past several years. But NASCAR does not limit testing at tracks that do not host Cup races. As a result, a number of smaller venues are being used on an almost weekly basis as teams try to gain an advantage with the COT. At JGR, developmental drivers helped test the new COT. Hendrick Motorsports went as far as to field a dedicated test team to work out the initial bugs with its car. And it's no surprise that Hendrick drivers -- Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson and Kyle Busch -- have won the first five COT races. Roush contends that the testing limits, as well as a tire-leasing program that prevents teams from obtaining current model tires from Goodyear, were meant as a way to level the playing field as the new car was introduced. But by going around those limits, he says teams have violated the spirit of the rules. "NASCAR was going to stop us from taking tires home because they did not want us to test these cars," Roush says. "They were going to start everybody on the Car of Tomorrow on an even basis, saying there's four or five tests -- whatever it was -- that's what you get. "Well, the teams that have been successful, and I'll name names -- the Hendrick organization, the Gibbs organization and the Childress organization -- have been testing these cars multiple times a week on racetracks that were outside of NASCAR's control with tires that were not Goodyears, for the most part, because they won't sell the tires. . . . The teams were out going around NASCAR's policy and their intention by buying other people's tires and going to racetracks." Of course, Roush is right. That is exactly what happened. But any organization with the resources and the financial wherewithal should have done the same thing. The Hendrick team didn't try to hide the fact it was testing extensively with the new car. Nor did Joe Gibbs Racing. The majority of teams spent tremendous amounts of money on testing at tracks outside NASCAR's jurisdiction before the arrival of the Car of Tomorrow. Is it any wonder they continued that program as the new car was worked into the schedule? And if such testing is wrong? Well, better to be wrong and competitive than right and trying to catch up. Roush says he has now decided to go headfirst into the testing game, which includes hiring additional employees and dedicating the necessary equipment. "If you don't want us to test, then you need to have us sign something in the application that says, 'We agreed that we would not test our cars with Goodyear tires or anybody else's tires, except for at the racetracks that NASCAR approved,'" Roush says. "NASCAR didn't do that. They left the door open and we got behind, but we're going to catch up." That said, Roush's predicament is no one's fault but his own -- not the other owners' and not NASCAR's. His criticisms only make his organization's failure to thoroughly do its job more obvious.

ACLU targets planner of so-called CIA torture flights Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Bedard throws down aces as Orioles win By DOUG TUCKER AP Sports Writer Article Launched: 05/30/2007 09:35:48 PM PDT Click photo to enlarge Baltimore Orioles' Nick Markakis watches his ball after hitting a two-run home run during the ninth inning of a baseball game against the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday, May 30, 2007, in Kansas City, Mo. The Orioles won 3-0, sweeping the Royals in a three-game series. KANSAS CITY, Mo.- Giving up only eight earned runs in his previous 34 innings hadn't produced a win, so Erik Bedard took the next logical step. He didn't give up any runs at all. Outpitching Kansas City's Gil Meche, Bedard allowed four hits in eight innings Wednesday night and led Baltimore to a 3-0 victory, the fifth straight win for the Orioles and the seventh loss in a row for the hapless Royals. "It's always tough when it's 0-0 late in the game," Bedard said. "But you just stay in there and battle and good things will happen." Winless since April 18, Bedard (4-3) had five strikeouts and two walks in his longest outing of the season. Only one runner got past second against the left-hander. Jay Payton broke up the scoreless duel with an RBI single in the eighth and Nick Markakis, inserted into right field for defensive purposes, hit a two-run homer in the ninth off Zack Greinke. Meche (3-4) bounced back from his worst outing of the year to throw one of his best games since joining Kansas City. "Gil was terrific," said Royals' manager Buddy Bell, who was ejected in the top of the eighth for arguing with Marty Foster after the home plate umpire had thrown out Emil Brown for arguing a called third strike. "It's hard to win when you don't score any runs," Bell said. "He gave us what we needed, but we couldn't do anything with Bedard." After matching Bedard with seven shutout innings, Meche departed when Payton grounded an RBI single through the hole into left with one out in the eighth. The right-hander gave up four hits and one run in 7 1-3 innings. He walked four and had five strikeouts after allowing seven runs and 11 hits in 4 1-3 innings his previous start. "Coming out of a slump against Bedard is not an easy thing to do," Meche said. "He just beat us." Chris Ray pitched a perfect ninth for his 12th save in 15 chances. Rain delayed the game at the start 1 hour, 36 minutes, then the pitchers did their best to get the fans home quickly. The game took 2:31. It had been so long since his last win, Bedard said he couldn't remember when it happened. "I know it was a long time ago," he said. But frustration, he added, is "part of the game." "It happened the first two years. It happened last year. It happens every year," he said. "You go through a span where you don't win for four or five games in a row, then you win five in a row. It's part of the game." Ramon Hernandez walked leading off the eighth for the Orioles, whose five-game winning streak is their longest of the season. Corey Patterson was safe at first when he laid down a bunt and beat the throw to the bag. The runners moved up on Brian Roberts' sacrifice bunt, and then Payton's single broke the scoreless tie. Greinke came in for Meche and struck out the next two batters, Miguel Tejada and Aubrey Huff, on six pitches, but surrendered a single to Kevin Millar ahead of Markakis' home run. Meche's lower back had tightened up in his previous start, rendering him ineffective. But facing a Baltimore lineup which had scored 31 runs and hit .315 while winning four in a row, he was dominant for seven innings. Mora singled leading off the second, then the right-hander retired 16 in a row before walking Roberts to lead off the sixth. The seven-game skid is the longest of the year for the Royals, who again have reclaimed the worst record in the majors. In getting swept three games by the Orioles, the Royals managed only three runs and 12 hits. They now begin a seven-game road trip to Tampa Bay and Cleveland. "They're all frustrated," Bell said of his players. "And I'm right there with them." Notes:@ Baltimore LHP Jamie Walker was passing out cigars celebrating the birth of his fourth child. He'd been away for two days to be with wife Natalie. ... Bell hadn't been thrown out of a game since April 9 at Toronto.

http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingsports/ci_6025585&cid San Jose Mercury News - Guerrero's 3-run homer lifts Angels 8-6 san jose / valley start / stop paper (From the last 24 hours) Prosecutors: Aptos woman lived high life on &#36;1.5 million stolen... ACLU targets planner of so-called CIA torture flights Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Guerrero's 3-run homer lifts Angels 8-6 Article Launched: 05/30/2007 11:29:29 PM PDT ANAHEIM, Calif.- It isn't often the Los Angeles Angels get home runs from their 3-4-5 hitters in the same game. They came at the right time, because Jered Weaver didn't have his best stuff. Vladimir Guerrero hit a go-ahead, three-run shot off Felix Hernandez, Gary Matthews Jr. and Casey Kotchman hit consecutive home runs in the first, and the Angels bullpen preserved an 8-6 win over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night. "It's good, because there are going to be sometimes when we're not going to do well offensively and our pitchers pick us up and keep us in close ballgames," Guerrero said through a translator. "We have a good pitching staff, and hopefully all of us can contribute to them." Guerrero's homer was his first since May 17 at Seattle. It hasn't been easy getting good pitches to hit, because everyone is pitching around the 2004 AL MVP. Guerrero's greatest strength is he is one of the game's best bad-ball hitters. "I can't get frustrated because it's part of the game. I've been saying that for a long time," Guerrero said. "I don't get frustrated because I trust the people that hit behind me. The home runs just happen when they happen. I don't worry about when they come or when they don't come. But I'm very happy that this one came tonight." Dustin Moseley (4-0) got the win in relief of Weaver, who was pulled after 4 2-3 innings with the Angels down 5-4. After Guerrero's homer put Los Angeles ahead 7-5, Moseley pitched two innings and gave up an RBI double to Raul Ibanez that cut the Angels' edge to 7-6 in the sixth. But Scot Shields pitched a perfect eighth and Francisco Rodriguez worked the ninth for his 18th save in 19 chances. Hernandez (3-3) allowed seven runs and nine hits in seven innings. He surrendered his first three homers of the season, as the Angels took the rubber game of the series and extended their lead in the AL West to 5 1/2 games over the second-place Mariners. "We were a little disappointed because we felt we had a chance to win the game with our ace on the mound," Adrian Beltre said. "It didn't happen, but we're going to get a chance to face these guys again, and hopefully we can do better next time. We've got four months left, so one series is not going to make a difference right now." Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak to 23 games&mdash;tying his career best in 2001. The two-time AL batting champion is within one game of the franchise record set by Joey Cora in 1997. Weaver had won his previous three starts, and the Angels gave him a 4-1 lead in the first inning. But the Mariners made it 4-all on Beltre's RBI double in the fifth and Yuniesky Betancourt followed with an RBI single that finished the right-hander. "My command just really wasn't there," Weaver said. "The off-speed stuff felt great, but I was struggling with my fastball command. I just couldn't make my pitches and they put some good swings on the ball." Pinch-hitter Robb Quinlan drove in an insurance run in the Angels seventh with a sacrifice fly that Betancourt caught. The shortstop made an over-the-shoulder catch in short left-center field and couldn't get the ball home fast enough after Reggie Willits tagged up. Guerrero had a chance to break open the game in the eighth, but struck out with the bases loaded against Brandon Morrow. The rookie reliever extended his scoreless streak to 15 2-3 consecutive innings. The Mariners wrapped up a 6-4 road trip that began with a makeup game in Cleveland and continued through Tampa Bay, Kansas City and Anaheim. When they return to Seattle, the journey will have covered 6,273 miles. "It's going to be good to get back home," Beltre said. "We finished the road trip over .500 and we could have done better, but it was a good trip." Notes:@ Angels infielder Erick Aybar started at third base for the first time in his professional career. Normally a second baseman, he made a neat play on the first batter of the game, making a diving stop on Suzuki's grounder in the hole and throwing him out from one knee. ... Angels RHP Bartolo Colon's next scheduled start on Sunday was pushed back to June 8, when the club opens a nine-game road trip at St. Louis. The 2005 AL Cy Young winner, experiencing tightness in his triceps since early this month, has allowed 15 runs in 10 2-3 innings over his last two starts.

http://myespn.go.com/blogs/truehoop/0-24-138/Thanks--Jazz.html&cid Skip to the content May 31, 2007 12:05 PM Throughout the playoffs, those Jazz played very well. That team was intense. The future would seem to be very bright. Even against San Antonio they made plays. Things were happening. San Antonio was just, to my eyes at least, so much better. Brad Rock of the Deseret News says the Jazz can walk away with heads held high:  So the Jazz are gone for 2007. Yet in another sense, they're back. One thing the Spurs, Mavericks, Suns and everyone else in the talent-crowded Western Conference has to know deep down in their size 18 shoes: The Jazz are coming. They're young, confident and most important, now they've had a taste. Isn't that what Jerry Sloan feared all along? That his teams would forget - or never know - what it feels like when every single possession counts. When the Earth seems to tilt with each possession. So now they know. This postseason is the stuff they'll remember when they get old. "Once you get a taste of how good it feels," said reserve guard Ronnie Brewer, "you just want to try to get back." Wouldn't it be nice to leave it there: a team on the way up. It's not all peaches and cream, though. Deron Williams, Carlos Boozer, and Derek Fisher all did some pointed questioning of the desire and effort of unnamed teammates (speculated by reporters on the scene to be the imported trio of Gordan Giricek, Andrei Kirilenko, and Mehmet Okur). Ross Siler of the Salt Lake Tribune If what Boozer says is true, the Jazz had a player or players who made vacation plans for next week. Not played as if he wanted to go on vacation. Actual plans. Boozer contrasted that with Derek Fisher's supreme effort not to leave the team hanging in Game 5. "It's sad to say that because where we are, we're in the Western Conference finals," Boozer said, "and we have some guys already having vacation plans. "On the other side of the spectrum, you see a guy like D-Fish who went across the country to take care of his daughter and fly all the way back just to make it to the game. "It's sad to have that. You have a couple guys on vacation. One guy having some real life stuff go on and still try to make it back and give everything he has. That's a problem and we need to get that fixed this summer. "I'll never call out a teammate. I'll never say anything negative directly to a teammate because I love my team and I believe in that code. But we need guys that are always going to give everything they have. "We need guys that have a championship vision. When you have your vacation plans already, that's not a championship vision." Similarly, when asked about signing an extension next summer, Deron Williams made clear that he was not happy about how some things went last year. Tribune Columnist Gordon Monson smells change Well, well, well. If Deron and Carlos are unhappy, hold onto your shorts, fellas.

But of all the hot-button topics addressed by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman at his annual Stanley Cup state-of-the-league session Monday, by far the most intriguing was his admission that he is ... well, "intrigued" by the possibility of more Canadian franchises in the future. Specifically, his reference to Winnipeg - a clear softening of his previous position on the Manitoba capital, which the NHL abandoned in 1996 - sounded very much like an invitation to get serious. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman speaks at a news conference Monday in Anaheim, Calif. Email to a friend "I am intrigued in the sense that I don't like franchise relocation - I think my record on that is clear to everyone in this room," Bettman said, two hours before Game 1 of the Stanley Cup final commenced at the Honda Center. "So, for example, when we had a chance to go back to Minnesota, we did because it made sense: the right ownership, the right building situation, the market was strong and vibrant. We haven't studied Quebec City or Winnipeg or anywhere else in Canada, but the notion of putting a franchise back in a place where one was lost feels good ... provided we don't end up in a situation where we've created a prescription for another failing franchise." Most of the speculation about BlackBerry founder and billionaire Jim Balsillie's pending purchase of the struggling Nashville franchise - which still hasn't received NHL approval - has been that he intends to move the team as soon as possible, and the guess is that Kitchener-Waterloo, Ont., which has no suitable building at the moment, would be his preferred location. Or if not there, somewhere in southern Ontario. But there is also movement afoot to convince the NHL that there is now viable ownership in Winnipeg, though that would likely have to involve a partnership of the Asper family, which has the money if it has the desire to spend it, with the current owner of the Manitoba Moose, Mark Chipman, who controls the new MTS Centre. Bettman referenced an editorial in Monday's National Post (owned by CanWest Global Communications Corp. which is controlled by the Aspers) in which it was suggested that if relocation to a city in Canada is being considered, the NHL owes it to Winnipeg. "It's obviously something I've thought about, to try to make right something that at one point in our history went wrong," said Bettman. "Now, we left Quebec City and Winnipeg because there was no new building, no prospect of a new building and no one wanted to own the teams there." However, he said, "we've been getting lots of expressions of interest." As for Kitchener or Hamilton or ... "I was talking about cities we left. That's where the intriguing notion comes from," Bettman said. "I haven't given a thought to anywhere else." The parameters for a team in Canada have changed since the '90s, Bettman said, "because with the [salary cap] partnership we have with players, and the revenue sharing, while it's something we haven't studied, it seems to me more likely than it was three-four-five years ago."

Nafzger said he talked to owner James Tafel for two hours Wednesday night before deciding against a rematch with Preakness winner Curlin in the final leg of the Triple Crown. "The competitive side said 'Go,' the logical side said 'No, no, no,'" Nafzger said. Nafzger said they will aim toward the summer and fall schedule that features the Travers and Breeders' Cup. "Mr. Tafel said let's not chase spilled water," Nafzger said. "We spilled our water during the Preakness. We got beat. We got outran." Street Sense and jockey Calvin Borel appeared headed to the Belmont to chase the Triple Crown when he took the lead deep in the stretch at the Preakness, only to have Curlin and jockey Robby Albarado slip by at the wire. So with the opportunity of being the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978 gone, Tafel wants his colt to chase the possibility of becoming the first horse to win the Derby, the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, the Travers and the Breeders' Cup Classic. The Travers is Aug. 25 at Saratoga. The Breeders' Cup Classic is Oct. 27 at Monmouth Park. Nafzger said there was a concern that Street Sense wouldn't have time to get properly prepared for the Travers if he ran the 1 1/2-mile Belmont. The horse will be able to rest and compete in one or two races between now and the Travers, including possibly the Jim Dandy. "I know there's disappointment we're not going to the Belmont," Nafzger said. "But somewhere we want to make another stand." About the Real Cities Network Terms of Use & Privacy Statement

Buy and sell tickets to premium and sold out events Search by events or regions: Looking to sell tickets quick? NASCAR considers relaxing testing policy CHARLOTTE (AP) &#151; NASCAR is considering opening up its restrictive testing policy, which several teams already have skirted this season. Currently, rules limit teams to seven tests on Nextel Cup-sanctioned tracks, and crew chiefs help NASCAR decide the venues and dates. NASCAR adopted that policy two years ago to help underfunded teams keep up with big-budget organizations, who could afford to test anytime. But as the Car of Tomorrow was rolled into competition, the top teams found ways to test it outside of the rules. "It appears that we've got teams that want to test more and teams that want to test less, and teams that test on tires that are not made by our tire supplier," Robin Pemberton, NASCAR vice president of competition, told The Associated Press on Wednesday. "So we're going to start looking at a lot of different things, from eventually lifting the test ban completely, or get as restrictive as we cannot let teams test anywhere at any time, or land somewhere in between." NASCAR most likely will relax the restrictions, because it's having a hard time policing teams. More than 20 teams tested Tuesday and Wednesday at Virginia International Raceway, a road course where they could simulate the June 24 race in Sonoma, Calif. Because VIR is not a sanctioned track, any team can go there and still be within NASCAR's guidelines. But teams can't use current Goodyear tires because of a leasing agreement intended to prevent extracurricular testing. To circumvent the lack of available tires, teams have started using other manufacturers for test sessions. They also snapped up much of Goodyear's inventory from 2005 and earlier. Goodyear officials declined a request from The Associated Press for comment Wednesday, and NASCAR said the teams have not technically broken the rules. Hendrick Motorsports, winners of nine of the first 12 races this season, is believed to have lapped the field in testing this year. Team officials said they've used a variety of test drivers about 30 times this year, and rival car owner Jack Roush said that's unfair. He said his own five-car team is behind the competition, because he didn't purchase tires from Hoosier or B.F. Goodrich for tests. "The teams that have been successful ... they've gone to tracks outside NASCAR's control with tires that were not from Goodyear," Roush said. "Right now, Goodyear is sitting on millions of dollars worth of tires that are growing obsolete and hard in their warehouses. Teams have gotten around NASCAR's policy by buying other people's tires and testing at tracks that aren't on the Nextel Cup schedule. "I got behind on that. I didn't do that." But using tires other than what Goodyear provides on race day is a crapshoot, many crew chiefs said. "Relaxing the testing policy only makes sense if we can use current Goodyears," said Mike Ford, crew chief for Denny Hamlin. "You can really end up going pretty far down the wrong road that way, but you have no choice because everyone is doing it." Hamlin tested at VIR on "some really old Goodyears," but Ford said it was only the second time this season the No. 11 team has gone outside a NASCAR-sanctioned test. Joe Gibbs Racing's research and development team has tested cars at various times independent of Hamlin's team this year. Ford said he believes NASCAR's prohibitive policy created the testing problems. "They are forcing teams to spend money with other tire manufacturers instead of with Goodyear, the company NASCAR supports," he said. "One way or the other, everybody is going to test."

Speak out: Why are TV ratings low? May 31, 2007 04:30 AM ANAHEIM, Calif.-It feels, to be honest, like the letdown of the '70s after the idealism and euphoria of the '60s. Remember the excitement coming out of the lockout? A new economic system would tame runaway salary inflation and ensure the survival of well-run teams, and imagination and skill would be returned to the game on a nightly basis through a more reasonable interpretation of the rule book. Now look at the events of the past week or so. The Nashville Predators, one of the leagueâ€™s best teams, are going out of business, the top salary is expected to be close to $10 million (U.S.) next season, offence has vanished in the post-season and the sport's showcase event, the Stanley Cup final, is a frozen version of soccer, complete with the re-birth of obstruction. Game 2 of the Stanley Cup final last night between the Ottawa Senators and Anaheim Ducks started in promising fashion: hard, physical and nearly riotous. But it gradually slowed and ended up as a game dominated by predictable dump-and-chase hockey. Funny, huh? It used to be the stolid, dull Eastern Conference teams would try to slow the speedy, creative Western Conference teams. Now the shoe is on the other (webbed) foot. Some people love this stuff, and bully for them. But television ratings suggest there's little appetite for such conservative hockey as we wander into June, and when hardworking and chippy (dirty?) Sammy Pahlsson has become the star of the Cup final, you know the circus has definitely left town. It's not bad hockey, and the intensity and hitting is terrific. But it's basically like watching the same sequence over and over. Anyone for four-on-four? Maybe Ottawa, with just 16 shots last night, can find its game after another excitement-sucking, two-day break in the proceedings before Game 3 on Saturday. Maybe someone in the NHL office will ask why Jean-Sebastien Giguere looks than he did in the 2003 final. The Ducks, quite obviously, are loving this, both the two victories they've extracted and the style and nature of the games. A total of six goals for both teams in the final suggests Anaheim is dictating play. The Sens certainly deserve some of the blame for the lack of interesting offensive play, as their three star forwards â€“ Jason Spezza, Dany Heatley and Daniel Alfredsson â€“ apparently checked out of the post-season after the conference final. Fittingly, Spezza and Heatley combined for a mid-ice turnover on Pahlsson's winning goal late in the third, with Alfredsson basically waving at the Ducks centre as he sped to the net on a play reminiscent of the Ottawa captain's infamous matador-like play against Buffalo's Jason Pominville in last year's playoffs. When Pahlsson and his linemates, Travis Moen and Rob Niedermayer, have played head-to-head against the Spezza unit, it has been the Ducks line that attacked more effectively. If there is hope for this series â€“ or for the Senators â€“ it lies in the fact the Ducks won all their home games in the '03 final against New Jersey, but lost all the road tilts and the Cup. Then again, there are few meaningful comparisons to be made between the two Anaheim outfits. Hope for the game, meanwhile, lies in the Bettman administration acknowledging that there's a big problem brewing here with dwindling offence. Again. But don't expect it to happen.

Try as they might, even MTV wouldn't dare create a reality show plotline similar to what transpired over the radio airwaves Wednesday afternoon. Nobody would buy it. First Kobe and the Lakers are broken up. Then they are back together. Then they are back on the rocks. What's next? Will Kobe be on the front page of tomorrow morning's New York Post canoodling with Jerry West? By the time this article gets posted, who knows whether Kobe will be flirting with Jerry Buss, or fighting with Mitch Kupchak. He might be batting his eyes at Phil Jackson, or threatening to blacken the eye of a certain "Laker insider." Either which way, one thing seems fairly certain: Kobe Bryant will remain a member of the Los Angeles Lakers for at least two more seasons. The Lakers are simply not going to trade him. They have no reason or motivation to do so. And Kobe has 88.6 million reasons to honor his contract. The Laker organization would never even consider such a drastic move unless Kobe flat-out refused to play the 2007-2008 season in a purple and gold uniform. At the end of the day, money talks, and we know what walks. (Besides, they never call traveling in the NBA). And from the Lakers perspective, it would be fiscally irresponsible to trade the most marketable player in the NBA. Kobe's jersey was once again the NBA's top-seller this year; his #24 even outsold Yao Ming’s jersey in China The Lakers charge a king's ransom for their overpriced seats and the reason then can get away with it is due in large part to Kobe Bryant's star power. You think Jack Nicholson and Denzel Washington are showing up if Kobe Bean Bryant isn't in the building. Fat chance. Last time I checked, there were a few other entertainment options in and around LA. Kobe has proven he can do no wrong in certain fan's eyes; he has a die-hard contingent of supporters that will cheer for him no matter what. That fact has already been established. Thus, as of 12:20 pm EST Wednesday afternoon, I would have bet my co-op that Jerry Buss and the Lakers would never, ever trade Kobe. Then, however, I heard Mr. Bryant's interview with Screamin' A. Smith on ESPN Radio in New York. Kobe was in full-out attack mode. It was as if he caught Raja Bell hitting on his wife or found out one of his teammates was thinking about taking a last-second shot. Kobe was incensed. He lambasted the Lakers front-office, insinuating that he had been lied to, deceived, hood-winked, and bamboozled. (All this from an organization that pays him $20 million a season to play hoops and stood by him during the infamous Colorado incident.) It appeared Kobe was putting his foot down. He was mad as hell and he wasn't going to take it anymore. Claiming that there was "no other alternative," Kobe demanded the Lakers trade him. And whether you consider it a positive or a negative character trait, we all know that Kobe is extremely determined, pig-headed even, when he sets his mind on something. The Black Mamba was spitting venom. Would he be stubborn enough to force a trade from the LA? For the next hour, cell-phones were blowing up from coast to coast. (I bet if Sprint and Nextel operators could have tracked the cell-phone records of those people who subscribe to the NBA League Pass, they would have thought it was midnight on New Year's Eve.) "Dude, did you hear Kobe?" "Did he really say that?" Followed by the inevitable, "Yo, can we get him? What would we have to give up?" The basketball universe was spinning off its axis. Text-messages were being fired off at a record rate. Microsoft Outlook inboxes in cubicles across America were inundated with all sorts of trade proposals. Kobe sounded like he had made up his mind. His days in LA were done. What was going to happen next? Alas, it only lasted a few hours. Before you knew it, before we even had a chance to think about the possibility of him landing in Boston or Chicago, Kobe was on Dan Patrick back-peddling faster than Carmelo Anthony in Madison Square Garden. "I just hope and hope that something can be resolved. Something can be figured out. Just something so I can stay here and be in this city and be with the team I love," Kobe told Dan Patrick. Bryant explained that Phil Jackson had reached out to him and assuaged his fears. (Why do I have a strange feeling that his agent placed a call as well?) Next on the make-up tour was AM 570 KLAC, where KB24 continued to profess his undying love for the Lakers organization. What a shame, couldn't he have at least waited a day before they kissed and making up? Give writers, fans, bloggers, and talk-radio hosts at least 24 hours to dissect trades that would never happen. What a drag - I had a beauty that would have landed Kobe in a Knicks uniform (Curry, Crawford, and Frye for Bryant - yes, the salaries match-up).... Nope, it just wasn't meant to be. Did Kobe really want to be traded, or did he just want to have his ego massaged? By 6 pm, Kobe was back in the good graces of the Laker family. The lovers quarrel had been amicably settled. The irreconcilable differences had been resolved. Kobe was ready to say "I do" all over again. And to think, Jerry Buss didn't even have to buy him a $4 million ring?!?! Kobe should have held out for more, he could at least have gotten Buss and Kupchak to use the full mid-level exception this summer...

What would this dismal Yankee season be without him? Think the A-Rod scandal is bad? doesn't. He says it's good for a laugh and good for the pitiful Yankees. What do you think? The big city tabloid may be an antiquated form of journalism, but it endures, in part, as a purveyor of guilty pleasures. And so I set out for my local newsstand, another institution perilously close to obsolescence, and gave the guy two bucks plus tax for the national edition of the That boldly hyphenated construction &#151; the aforementioned "Stray-Rod" &#151; spoke of a headline writer at the top of his (or her) game. The front page promised that highest form of tabloid life, a mystery blonde. Unlike Buttafuocos or Trumps, the mystery blonde does not fall from fashion &#151; and this particular one was good as advertised. Not only did the shade of her locks approach platinum, but she seemed very well nourished in the thoracic region. Every tale has its ideal medium, and no doubt this was best suited for print. A story like this warrants getting your fingers a little grimy. According to the Rodriguez &#151; married father of a 2-year-old daughter &#151; and the mystery blonde went to a Toronto strip club called "The Brass Rail." They stayed there for an hour or so, then returned to the Four Seasons, where they were last seen getting into the same elevator. There is no official word yet whether the mystery blonde has been improperly enhanced by an artificial substance. Though buxom blondes are part of, shall we say, the fabric of the game, they are not subject to routine testing. Still, before you dismiss this mystery blonde as a mere bimbo, consider that she may yet be to the A-Rod allegory what Bernard Malamud's temptress was to The Natural. says this is just the sort of distraction the Yankees need. Even in the halcyon halls of FOXSports.com the news has met with some resistance. Some of my colleagues don't think it's a story at all. Well, we might argue about propriety or taste. My own notion of decorum causes me to refrain from judging the third baseman, as that task belongs to Mrs. A-Rod. Let him pay for his sins, whatever they might be, in couples therapy. That should be deterrent enough. Let me also admit that the front page injures my argument that A-Rod is a warm and cuddly alternative to Barry Bonds. But please, don't tell me it's not a story. I mean, how invincibly stupid is this guy? Besides, this is all very funny. You know it is. If you can't chuckle holding that newspaper, you don't have a pulse. And by that measure, baseball owes a debt of gratitude to Alex Rodriguez. He did what he could for his team, knocking all those homers in April. Still, at this writing, the $200 million Yankees are 14 1/2 games behind the Red Sox. This is bad for the game. It's not just Yankee fans who need the Yankees to be good. It's the rest of the country, too. The Yankees should be worthy of contempt, not pity. But news of their latest failure seems to lead the nightly highlight shows. Pathetic. Those tight shots of Joe Torre &#151; forced to explain yet another loss &#151; make him seem downright Nixonian. Then there's Brian Cashman, as dour as Kissinger in the Final Days. Even Steinbrenner fails to entertain. He is quoted as saying something about winning and competing, and it recalls the end of the "Wizard of Oz." I fear someone will pull back the curtain in the Tampa headquarters and find that Steinbrenner is long gone, replaced by his megaphone-wielding publicist, Howard Rubenstein. It's sad is what it is. So let's treat this scoop with the perspective it deserves. A-Rod does not yet rank in the pantheon of Yankee heroes, with legendary debauchers like Ruth, DiMaggio and Mantle. But at least he offers some respite from a relentlessly dreary Yankee season. Besides, as everybody knows, when a team is slumping you need to change things up. Shuffle the order, as it were. That said, maybe Joe Torre should get a mystery blonde of his own. Mark Kriegel is a national columnist for FOXSports.com.

(CP) - NHL commissioner Gary Bettman gave his strongest indication yet Monday that having a team return to Winnipeg could happen one day. Bettman, in his state-of-the union address to the media before Game 1 of the Stanley Cup final, referred to an editorial in a Canadian newspaper he read this week which suggested that if the NHL did add another Canadian team it should go back to Winnipeg first because they have a new building and the NHL owes it to them. "I'm not opining on whether or not that's an opinion that I agree with, but it is an interesting and intriguing thought," Bettman said in a comment that raised eyebrows. While he stressed that there really hadn't been that much thought put into it at this point and that he had no plans for any current NHL teams to re-locate or for the league to expand, he does see the chance for Winnipeg to get a team back one day. "When we had the chance to go back to Minnesota, we did. Because it made sense, the right ownership, the right building situation," said Bettman. "The market was strong and vibrant. We haven't studied Quebec City or Winnipeg or anywhere else in Canada, but the notion that if it could work to put a franchise back in a place where one was lost, feels good - provided we don't wind up in a situation where we've created a prescription for another failing franchise. "So am I intrigued? It's obviously something I've thought about in terms of trying to make right something that one point in our history went wrong." The Jets left Winnipeg for Phoenix after the 1995-96 season. Bettman believes the salary cap and revenue sharing facets of the new collective bargaining agreement provides a chance for a market like Winnipeg to make a go of it. But another team in Toronto? Bettman is not a fan of that idea, despite the fact there are three clubs in the New York/New Jersey area and two teams here in Southern California. "It's not something I've given any thought to," Bettman said of having another team in Toronto. "... I frankly think, and I live in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area, it's tough for all the clubs to get media attention, particularly when they're having tough years on the ice. "There's some real downside to having multiple teams in one market." The message seems clear from the commissioner: if Jim Balsillie wants to move the Nashville Predators, the NHL would rather have them move to Winnipeg than Waterloo, Ont., the home of the Research In Motion CEO. But Bettman also said too many people are wrongly assuming the Predators will move. "I met with Mr. Balsillie last week and I specifically asked him whether or not he had specific plans or intentions with respect to moving this franchise and he told me that he did not," said Bettman. "So I think there's been entirely too much speculation in terms of what comes next." Balsillie's purchase of the Predators still needs owners' approval, a vote that could come later in June. -Rick Tocchet, who last Friday in New Jersey pleaded guilty to promoting gambling and conspiracy to promote gambling in a plea deal. He has been suspended by the NHL from his job as Phoenix Coyotes assistant coach since the investigation opened in February 2006. The NHL is also still doing its own investigation. "I'm not really in a position to say what's going to happen until there's a complete disposition of his case and until our independent investigator has had an opportunity to interview him, finish interviewing some other people, and then present his report," said Bettman. "At that point I'll be able to make a determination in terms of what his status should or should not be." -Bettman said he expects league revenues to have increased between 6.5-7 per cent this season, which means the $44-million salary cap will likely rise to between $48 million or $49 million for next season; -More games in Europe or an increased presence in Europe will also continue to be a focus for the NHL. &copy; The Canadian Press, 2007 Senators fire blanks at Ducks in Game 2 Samuel Pahlsson scored with 5:44 left and Jean-Sebastien Giguere made 16 saves as the Anaheim Ducks blanked the Ottawa Senators 1-0 in Game 2 of the Stanley Cup final on Wednesday.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Thursday, May 31, 2007; Page E01 You think the Kobe Bryant soap opera can't get any juicier but it always does.

There's more intrigue in the latest Kobe reality show than the last hour of "The Good Shepherd." There's Kobe going public with his trade demand. There's his request that former Lakers boss Jerry West put off retirement to come back from Memphis and fix the Lakers. There's an implicit suggestion that current Lakers GM Mitch Kupchak has been inadequate in the specific area of acquiring talent -- which is true. There's "he-said," innuendo, revision of history and plenty of hurt feelings. By late Wednesday afternoon, Jackson had gotten hold of Kobe, who did a tiny little backslide on his trade demand in an ESPN interview with Dan Patrick. And by late evening in California, the backslide had turned into a full backpedal with Kobe telling the populace how much he wanted to stay in La-La. Either way, this is one May cliffhanger that isn't going to hold until fall. Bryant isn't going anywhere. The Lakers aren't going to trade him and shouldn't. West, arguably the greatest basketball executive who ever lived other than Red Auerbach, will get over being steamed at Kobe, push retirement away for a couple of years or so and ultimately save the Lakers. Within the next 48 hours, Kobe will have talked again with Jackson, also with West, also with owner Jerry Buss, who preferred Kobe over Shaq three years ago, and will conclude it was all a misunderstanding. We'll hear inside a week or so that they're all on the same page, that Kobe was simply demonstrating the great passion he has for the team, its fans and winning championships, which is what he's about. We'll hear Kobe say he was serious at the time, that his feelings were hurt, but that the club has promised him -- the great West has promised him -- that whatever happened the last three years is over and that the team will do whatever it has to do to return to championship form. But it won't keep all parties from viewing each other with suspicion. Bryant went about this terribly. Don't get me wrong, he's right to hate what Kupchak has and hasn't done with the team. Trading Caron Butler, now an all-star, for Kwame Brown, a bust in whatever uniform, has set the Lakers back years. But Kobe could have and should have gone about voicing his displeasure differently. I almost always love these public catfights. They're good for sports because they raise general interest and produce days worth of copy and fodder for talking heads. Even NBA locker rooms crackle with gossip. But Kobe owes the Lakers in a way few players owe their teams. The Lakers, from all indications, stood by him every step of the way during his lurid episode in Colorado a few years ago. Yes, the Lakers had their selfish interests, but regardless they backed him publicly, made every imaginable resource available privately. They walked him through the most difficult time of his life as best an organization could.

Well, that and the unlikely image of Snoop Dogg, the lanky gangsta rapper, holding aloft one of those foam fingers that proclaim the Ducks as No. 1. The Doggfather's latest offering is Da Blue Carpet Treatment. His favourite hockey team has laid out Da Black and Blue Carpet for the Senators, which suits Snoop just fine. "I love the intensity, the hitting and the way the guys bounce off the fibreglass walls," said Snoop. Comrie took an elbow from Ducks defenceman Francois Beauchemin in the schnozz. The Senators have figuratively taken it on the chin. They will limp home today with empty hands in this Stanley Cup final, down 2-0 and with their fans wondering if this wonderful spring run has finally run out of steam. The big line of Dany Heatley, Jason Spezza and Daniel Alfredsson, which has carried this team through the playoffs so magnificently, is now its liability. For the second straight game, the line was on the ice for the winner in the third period, victimized by the Ducks' checking line. It was Samuel Pahlsson who finished them last night after linemate Travis Moen had done it to them in Game 1. Pahlsson is the quiet star of this series, a punishing hitter, a stifling checker and, now, a big goal scorer. "Sammy's a Swede but he thinks he's from Red Deer," said Ducks GM Brian Burke. "I would love to score 50 goals a season but that's not me," said Pahlsson. "I just play the way I've always played. I haven't changed a lot." The domination of the Senators' big line by Pahlsson and his unit, backed up by the defensive tandem at even strength of Chris Pronger and Scott Niedermayer, is the story of this series. Pahlsson's winner came on another neutral-zone turnover. The Senators' only hope now is a return home will allow coach Bryan Murray, who gets last change, to get the big line away from the Pahlsson blanket. The Ducks, supposedly bigger and slower, beat the Senators to the puck on numerous occasions. The Sens managed to get some contact in of their own: Ottawa's Chris Kelly leveling Anaheim's Corey Perry with a strong shoulder check and winger Chris Neil hammering Beauchmin behind the Ducks' net. But Ottawa's only sustained presence in the Anaheim zone came during a 5-on-3 for 68 seconds in the first period. Comrie, Heatley and Spezza had chances but bobbled pucks or a piece of Giguere's equipment kept the game scoreless. The Senators can hope that a return to home ice will help them in the match-up game but don't count on it. Ducks coach Randy Carlyle is committed to the matchups and will change on the fly to get the Pahlsson group on the ice against Spezza. If not for the work of goaltender Ray Emery, the Sens would have not had a chance to win the game in the third period. As much as they have been outplayed for stretches in the first two games, that is one of the positives to which the Senators can cling, that they have had a chance to win each game. Snoop Dogg can hold his foam finger higher, proclaiming his team No. 1. It's hard to argue with him this morning.

Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Thursday, May 31, 2007 Posted on Thu, May. 31, 2007 Lleyton Hewitt Advances at French Open Russia's Maria Sharapova clenches her fist after defeating France's Emilie Loit in a first round match of the French Open tennis tournament at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris, Wednesday May 30, 2007. Sharapova won 6-3, 7-6. (AP Photo/Michel Spingler) PARIS - Lleyton Hewitt rallied from two sets down for the fourth time in his career Thursday and beat 2004 champion Gaston Gaudio 4-6, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 in the second round of the French Open. Hewitt, a two-time Grand Slam champion, missed two months because of a back injury and returned at the Rome Masters in early May. He broke his Argentine opponent in the third and seventh games of the third set, and then again to open each of the two remaining sets. "He's got to be one of the toughest second-round players to play," said Hewitt, who lost to Gaudio in the 2004 French Open quarterfinals. "The first two sets he played fantastic." The 14th-seeded Australian made 25 unforced errors in the first two sets, but limited that to 19 in the final three. He also had 20 aces, while Gaudio double-faulted 13 times. "I felt like I had a lot of opportunities to go up a break in the first set," Hewitt said. Hewitt stayed on course for a fourth-round rematch with two-time defending champion Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros. He lost to Nadal at the same stage last year. Hewitt has won the U.S. Open and Wimbledon and reached the final at the Australian Open. He has made the quarterfinals twice at the French Open, the last time losing to eventual champion Gaudio in 2004. Gaudio, who had reached the third round in Paris for five straight years, has only once won consecutive matches this year. Maria Sharapova, who missed nearly two months of the season because of an injured right shoulder, advanced to the third round in the women's draw, easily beating Jill Craybas of the United States 6-2, 6-1. "I feel it at times in the match," Sharapova said. "I try not to think about it." Up 2-1 at the start, Craybas held three break points at love-40. But Sharapova won the next 11 points, holding serve with the help of three forehand winners in a row, then breaking Craybas at love when the American dumped a volley into the net with the entire court open. In the second set, Craybas broke the second-ranked Russian in the sixth game, smiling and raising her hands after the winning point to accept the crowd's applause. But Sharapova broke right back to advance. Australian Open champion Serena Williams raced through the first set but was stretched in the second against Milagros Sequera, finally winning 6-0, 7-6 (3). No. 7 Ana Ivanovic defeated Sania Mirza 6-1, 6-4. No. 14 Patty Schnyder, No. 17 Katarina Srebotnik and No. 25 Lucie Safarova also advanced. On the men's side, No. 6 Novak Djokovic also reached the third round, beating Laurent Recouderc of France 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1. No. 16 Marcos Baghdatis, the 2006 Australian Open finalist, No. 7 Ivan Ljubicic and No. 20 Jarkko Nieminen also won. "Everybody now expects me to be the guy who can hurt the best two players in the world," said Djokovic, who has won three titles this year , including one on clay. Later Thursday, Nadal was to face Flavio Cipolla in the second round. Amelie Mauresmo also was scheduled to play. On Wednesday, top-ranked Roger Federer advanced to the third round, stopping Thierry Ascione of France 6-1, 6-2, 7-6 (8). The 10-time Grand Slam champion breezed through the first two sets, but as conditions worsened and the sun began to fade, so did his control of the match. "I know that they want to get their match over and done with," Federer said. Organizers have been trying to squeeze in extra matches because of the rain delays on the first two days of the tournament. "What I don't like is if they think ... I'm the favorite, I should win this in straight sets," said Federer, who finally walked off court at 9:15 p.m. "What about if it doesn't turn out this way?"

The Yankees defeated the Blue Jays 10-5. CANADA TORONTO- Alex Rodriguez helped the New York Yankees end their five-game losing streak with his bat&mdash;and his mouth. Rodriguez distracted Toronto third baseman Howie Clark by shouting at him on a key popup in the ninth inning, touching off arguments all over the field, and the Yankees beat the Blue Jays 10-5 Wednesday night. "I just said, 'Hah!' That's it," Rodriguez said. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't." It definitely worked in rankling the Blue Jays. "The thing about the Yankees, one of the reasons they're so respected, is they do things right. Always have," manager John Gibbons said. "They've got a lot of pride and a lot of class. They play the game hard. "That's not Yankee pride right there," he said. "That's not the way they play. I thought it was bush league." Rodriguez hit an RBI single with two outs in the ninth that made it 7-5. Jorge Posada followed with a high infield pop and Rodriguez ran hard, cutting between Clark and shortstop John McDonald. Replays showed Rodriguez shouting something, and Clark backed off at the last second. McDonald was only a few steps behind Clark, but couldn't make the catch and ball dropped for an RBI single. "I don't know what my intention was," Rodriguez said. "I didn't say, 'I got it' or anything like that." Clark claimed Rodriguez called for the ball. "I heard a 'Mine' call and so I let it go," Clark said. "It wasn't Johnny Mac. What do you do? It makes you mad." After the play, McDonald started jawing with Rodriguez, and third base umpire Chad Fairchild got between them. Gibbons came out to argue, and exchanged words with Rodriguez and third base coach Larry Bowa before leaving the field as plate umpire Eric Cooper intervened. Rodriguez stayed on the bag with a smirk. As Jason Giambi stepped up to hit, he seemed to get into it with catcher Jason Phillips and Cooper settled them down. Giambi followed with a two-run single. When the game ended, many of the Blue Jays stayed on the bench, staring at Rodriguez and the Yankees. Rodriguez brushed aside the Blue Jays' anger, saying the Yankees were "desperate" for a win. "Honestly, I couldn't care less," he said. "They have their opinions. We're looking not to be swept." Clark said he'd never seen&mdash;or heard&mdash;that play before. "This is my 16th season and it's never happened once," he said. Rodriguez said he's often heckled by opposing players. "That play happens to me three or four times a week, except it's not at third base, it's over in foul territory by the dugout," Rodriguez said. The Yankees didn't quite know what to think. "I wasn't sure that was allowed," outfielder Johnny Damon said. "If it is, maybe we'll keep on doing it." Said manager Joe Torre: "I don't know what to feel for it. It's not like he said, 'I got it.'" It certainly was an adventuresome day for Rodriguez. He made the cover of the New York Post on Wednesday&mdash;and not because of the Yankees' slump. "STRAY-ROD" blared the Page 1 headline across a picture of A-Rod and an unidentified woman in Toronto earlier this week. "Alex hits strip club with mystery blonde," it continued. "Absolutely no comment about anything personal and I certainly don't think this will be a distraction to our team," he said before Wednesday's win. Rodriguez has been in the middle of an unusual, on-field dispute before. In Game 6 of the 2004 AL championship series, he slapped the ball from Boston pitcher Bronson Arroyo's glove, and was called out for interference. Damon led off this game with a home run for the Yankees, who avoided falling nine games under .500 for the first time since they were 20-29 after play on June 20, 1995, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Robinson Cano hit three doubles and went 4-for-4 for the Yankees. Down 13 1/2 games to Boston in the AL East, New York starts a three-game series Friday night at Fenway Park. Pitching for the first time since May 26, Mariano Rivera recorded the final four outs for his fourth save in six chances. Alex Rios and Matt Stairs each hit two-run homers and McDonald added a solo shot. New York took a quick lead against rookie Jesse Litsch (1-2), scoring five times in the first inning. Damon opened the game with his 22nd career leadoff homer. Derek Jeter struck out, but Hideki Matsui's single and walks to Rodriguez and Posada loaded the bases for Giambi, who hit a sacrifice fly. Josh Phelps followed with a two-run single and Cano hit an RBI double, bringing Brian Tallet from the bullpen. Making just his fourth major league start, Litsch allowed a season-high five runs on four hits. Damon singled in the second for his 2,000th career hit. "I'm very proud," Damon said. "We'll see how far I can take it." Melky Cabrera singled home Cano in the sixth off reliever Josh Towers. Rookie Tyler Clippard (2-1) gave up three runs and four hits over five innings. He struck out three and walked five, but none of the walks came around to score. Rios homered in the third. Toronto then loaded the bases with two outs but Clark flied out. McDonald homered in the fourth and Stairs hit a two-run shot off reliever Brian Bruney in the seventh. It was the first time Bruney had given up a run since April 23 at Tampa Bay. He had pitched 13 2-3 scoreless innings since. Notes:@ The Yankees and Toronto next play in mid-July. ... Jeter finished 0-4 with three strikeouts. ... Reliever Brian Wolfe made his major league debut in the ninth, making him the 500th player in Blue Jays history.

http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/n/a/2007/05/30/sports/s203639D38.DTL&cid Spurs Beat Jazz to Reach NBA Finals Spurs Beat Jazz to Reach NBA Finals By JAIME ARON, AP Sports Writer Wednesday, May 30, 2007 (05-30) 21:33 PDT SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Tim Duncan and Tony Parker wasted no time showing how serious the San Antonio Spurs were about getting back into the NBA finals &#8212; immediately. Duncan and Parker powered an early 14-0 spurt that featured perhaps the most dominant stretch the Spurs have played all postseason and the Utah Jazz never recovered, letting San Antonio cruise to a 109-84 victory Wednesday night and into the championship round for the third time in five years. The Spurs took all the suspense out of it by taking a 23-point lead early in the second quarter. Although Utah got an emotional lift at halftime when Derek Fisher arrived from New York, where his infant daughter was getting medical care for a rare eye condition, the only thing in doubt by then was whether San Antonio will play Detroit or Cleveland in the finals. The title series begins a week from Thursday in San Antonio, regardless of who comes out of the East. The Pistons-Cavaliers series is tied 2-2, with Game 5 on Thursday night in Detroit. "It's great, it's about the journey," Duncan said. "Last year we had a tough finish. This year to come back, put the team together and to go through three really, really good teams to get here, it's tremendous." Having a nine-day layoff before the next round was part of the motivation behind San Antonio's get-it-over-with approach to Game 5. After all, the Spurs have the oldest roster in the league, so they're both wise enough to value not giving the underdogs any hope and eager to avoid playing another trip to Salt Lake City. San Antonio led only 16-11 when the game-breaking stretch began with Parker cutting through several big guys and making a tough layup. Over the next 2:13, Parker had seven more points, plus a perfect lob that Duncan slammed with as much authority as he ever does. Then Bruce Bowen capped the blitz with a 3-pointer from the left corner that put the Spurs up 30-11. They'd made eight straight shots, were 12-of-16 for the game, and were outrebounding the Jazz 13-4. With Fisher missing and starting point guard Deron Williams slowed by a sprained right foot, Utah never recovered. "Our first quarter was unbelievable," Parker said. "I can't remember, since I've been with the Spurs, shooting the ball like that. Our offense was great, our defense was great. ... You can't ask for a better start." Utah coach Jerry Sloan agreed. "They came at us really hard," Sloan said. "They destroyed our will to want to play. That was the whole thing. We abandoned our offense right away. And we never could get back into it the rest of the night. They put us where they wanted us all night long." Duncan and Parker each finished with 21 points and Manu Ginobili scored only 12. None of them played in the fourth quarter &#8212; it was that much of a blowout. By getting to the finals, San Antonio continues its bizarre trend of dominating the league in odd-numbered years since Duncan arrived for the 1997-98 season. The Spurs won it all in 1999, 2003 and '05, and even came close in the lone exception, losing the 2001 conference finals to the eventual champs, the Los Angeles Lakers. "It always feels good to be here," team owner Peter Holt said upon receiving the Western Conference trophy, a sparkling silver basketball, during an on-court presentation. "This is wonderful." "This is just part of the process," Bowen added, drawing a loud ovation. The looks on the faces of the Jazz players throughout the game showed their disappointment. However, star Carlos Boozer admitted Wednesday morning, "We're not even supposed to be here." Utah won 51 games and its division this season, but opened the playoffs on the road and lost the first two games. The Jazz rallied to beat Houston and got past eighth-seeded Golden State to reach the conference finals for the first time since 1998, yet were no match for the Spurs, especially in San Antonio. After taking a seven-point lead in the first quarter of the first game, Utah didn't lead during any of the other 11 quarters played here and has now lost 19 straight games on the Spurs' home court. "We feel good about having beaten them now," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. "It's just going to get more difficult for everybody as they spend more time together." Sloan may already have been looking ahead when he sent in Ronnie Brewer during the first half, figuring the experience would do the rookie some good in the long run. Brewer had played only two minutes this series and 24 all postseason. Late in the second quarter, Sloan used a lineup featuring deep reserves Brewer, Dee Brown and Rafael Araujo. Another rookie, Paul Millsap, joined that trio during the third quarter. Things were so out of hand by then that Fabricio Oberto took &#8212; and made &#8212; a 17-footer and 7-foot center Francisco Elson took &#8212; and missed &#8212; a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Utah's early game plan was to get shooters Andrei Kirilenko and Mehmet Okur out of their funks. Kirilenko took the Jazz's first two shots, making a dunk, and Okur took five in a row, making only one when the Spurs had their big run. It was their best stretch since Game 6 of the second round against Phoenix, when they turned a 63-61 lead with 5:23 left in the third quarter into a 20-point lead with nine minutes to play. Duncan actually went to the bench before the rally ended. Popovich told him, "Good job," and Duncan walked by as if he'd done nothing special. All he got was a light pat on the rear when he left the game for good with a few minutes left in the third quarter. Kirilenko ended up leading Utah with 13 points. Williams and Matt Harpring each scored 11. Boozer had nine on 3-of-10 shooting and Fisher had only two free throws in 15 minutes. San Antonio's Jacque Vaughn dribbled out the clock to end the game &#8212; sort of. There was still 0.3 seconds left on the clock, but Popovich shrugged and went to shake hands with Sloan and people began filling the floor. Officials scurried to get the Jazz to inbound the ball so time could run out. While the postgame ceremony was being set up, Utah players and coaches lined up to shake hands and hug the Spurs. Notes:@ Ever heard of a "correctable error?" The officials called one on themselves midway through the second quarter, realizing they'd called an offensive foul against Utah but not given San Antonio the free throws it was entitled to because the Jazz were over the limit. The Spurs had finished another possession when things were sorted out. ... The fourth quarter was such a joke that fans did the wave to entertain themselves. Former Spurs star David Robinson was among those getting up on cue. ... There are good storylines regardless of who San Antonio faces in the finals. Detroit would be a rematch of a tight 2005 finals, while Cleveland's coach (Mike Brown) and GM (Danny Ferry) came out of the Spurs' organization. ... Utah had been 2-0 when facing elimination this postseason, winning Games 6 and 7 of the Houston series. ... The Spurs improved to 13-4 in close-out games since 2003. Over the same span, they are now 7-2 in playoff series that feature a loss by at least 12 points. ... San Antonio won 58 regular-season games, more than Detroit (53) or Cleveland (50). That's why the finals will start in the Alamo City. Get up to 50% off home delivery of the Chronicle for 12 weeks!

Samuel Pahlsson scored with 5:44 left in the third period as the Ducks beat the Ottawa Senators 1-0 last night to take a two- games-to-none lead in the Stanley Cup Final. Jean-Sebastien Giguere made 16 saves in the Anaheim goal for his sixth career playoff shutout and first this year. It was the Ducks&#39; 11th one-goal victory in 14 wins this postseason. ``This game was very, very close all night,&#39;&#39; Ducks coach Randy Carlyle said in a televised news conference. ``And anytime you win a 1-0 hockey game in the Stanley Cup finals, you&#39;ve got to feel fortunate that bounces went your way.&#39;&#39; Senators goaltender Ray Emery stopped 30 shots in the loss at the Honda Center in Anaheim, California. The best-of-seven series now shifts to Ottawa for two games June 2 and 4. ``It&#39;s disappointing to not get a win down here,&#39;&#39; Ottawa defenseman Chris Phillips told reporters. ``But we can&#39;t hang our heads. We&#39;ve got two games at home to even this series out.&#39;&#39; Pahlsson scored his third goal of the playoffs unassisted after he picked up a loose puck just outside the Anaheim blue line. He carried it along the boards into the Ottawa defensive zone, cut into the right faceoff circle and fired a wrist shot past Emery. ``It&#39;s fun to score the goal,&#39;&#39; Pahlsson said in a news conference. ``But it&#39;s always about winning in the playoffs. And we&#39;re happy we got two wins from this.&#39;&#39; Ottawa put pressure on the Anaheim goal after Pahlsson&#39;s score. Jason Spezza had a point-blank shot from the slot stopped by Giguere and Peter Schaefer shot wide from the left side of the net with about 3:15 remaining. The Senators then pulled Emery for an extra skater in the final minute and kept the puck in the Anaheim end. Chris Pronger blocked two shots for the Ducks and Travis Moen blocked a third before time ran out. ``That&#39;s playoff hockey, there are going to be tight games,&#39;&#39; Pronger told reporters. ``Two evenly matched teams battling against one another. We were fortunate to get enough bounces tonight.&#39;&#39; Ottawa had a good chance to score in the first period when it had a two-man advantage for one minute and eight seconds. Giguere made several stops as the Senators pressured but were turned away. ``We got pretty fortunate that we were able to get out of that one with no goal,&#39;&#39; Giguere said. ``We can&#39;t afford to do that every game.&#39;&#39; To contact the reporter on this story: Bob Bensch in Trenton, New Jersey at Last Updated: May 31, 2007 03:09 EDT Lleyton Hewitt Recovers to Win at French Open; Nadal and Sharapova Advance Mickelson Withdraws From Memorial Golf Tournament With Left Wrist Injury Kentucky Derby Winner Street Sense Won&#39;t Race in Belmont Against Curlin

Kotschau, who played 224 career games for the Chicago Fire, which won the MLS Cup in 1998, Tampa Bay Mutiny, Colorado Rapids and Columbus Crew, was released by expansion Toronto. He appears to be completely recovered from a broken leg suffered last season. "Ritchie is a player that brings us a great deal of depth defensively," RSL technical director John Ellinger said. "He's comfortable on the ball in the back and should mesh well with the personalities on our squad." Kotschau scored a goal and had two assists in 2006 for Columbus, starting 23 of 26 games.

The breakdown of Kentucky Derby winner in the Preakness Stakes last May, and the subsequent public anguish over the fatal injury, drove the program forward. "When that happened, the industry was at a loss to be able to answer the question, 'How frequent are injuries?' " , president of the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation, told the Associated Press. "A lot of people took it as kind of an embarrassment that this industry can't answer that simple question." The information will be released only to state veterinarians to share with racetrack executives. "It is not my intention to allow this database to be used to point fingers and say, 'Your track is bad, your track is good, your track is worse than someone else,' " Scollay told the AP. "That's not constructive." The Maryland Jockey Club, which operates Laurel Park and Pimlico, initially was not reported to be among those involved with the program, but the Maryland tracks have signed on, said racing secretary "It's going to give us a lot of stats on what kind of injuries on what kinds of tracks, how often the horses ran -- the form has every little detail on it," Hale said. "I e-mailed [Scollay] today and said, 'Look, I assumed we were in on this and we're not on the list.' She wrote back, 'No problem,' so we're good." Before the advent of the new program, Maryland Racing Commission veterinarian compiled his own records and then shared them with the state tracks at the end of the year.

Buchholz (2-2) scattered five hits and gave up just one unearned run while striking out four and walking two for the Rockies, who had lost four of five. Ryan Shealy's two-out, three-run homer in the top of the ninth brought the Royals within two runs, but Brian Fuentes entered the game and got Esteban German to groundout for his 11th save of the season. Brad Hawpe hit a two-run home run for Colorado, while Todd Helton also went deep and scored three runs. Shealy finished 3-for-4 for Kansas City, which saw its three-game winning streak come to an end. Royals ace Gil Meche (3-2) gave up his first runs on the road this season, yielding eight hits and five runs through five-plus innings of work in the loss. A first inning error by center fielder Willy Taveras allowed Mark Grudzielanek to score on Mark Teahen's single. However, with one on and two outs in the fourth, Hawpe's fourth home run of the season put Colorado in front. Matt Holliday then led off the sixth with a double, Helton walked and Atkins followed with a blast over the right-field wall to make it 5-1 in favor of the Rockies. Helton added a two-out, solo homer in the seventh for a five-run Colorado advantage. Game Notes This was Meche's first-ever appearance against the Rockies...Before the game, Colorado designated infielder John Mabry for assignment and recalled outfielder Ryan Spilboroughs from Triple-A Colorado Springs.

Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant asked to be traded from the Lakers yesterday, a day after calling the team's front office "a mess." Kobe Bryant asks to be traded and then rescinds it just hours later Believing he had been insulted and misled, Kobe Bryant asked the Los Angeles Lakers for a trade yesterday and insisted nothing could change his mind. Then something did. He spoke with coach Phil Jackson and backed off his request. "I don't want to go anywhere, this is my team," Bryant told KLAC radio. "I love it here. I called Phil, man, he and I talked, it was an emotional conversation, but he just said, 'You know what, Kobe? Let us try to figure this thing out.' "Phil is a guy I lean on a lot." Some three hours earlier, in an interview with ESPN Radio, Bryant said: "I would like to be traded, yeah. Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative. It's rough, man, but I don't see how you can rebuild that trust. I just don't know how you can move forward in that type of situation." Bryant also told KLAC, the Lakers' flagship station, that he hadn't heard from owner Jerry Buss, indicating a conversation could go a long way toward resolving the matter. Buss issued a statement after Bryant's request, saying: "We are aware of the media reports. However, Kobe has not told us directly that he wants to be traded. We have made it very clear that we are building our team around Kobe and that we intend for him to be a Laker his entire career. We will speak directly to Kobe and until we do that, we will not comment publicly about this." Bryant told KLAC that his agent had contacted general manager Mitch Kupchak early yesterday. Bryant, who helped the Lakers win three consecutive NBA championships, has four years left on the $136.4-million US, seven-year contract he signed July 15, 2004. That was a day after Shaquille O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat. Bryant became infuriated Tuesday when a Los Angeles Times columnist quoted a Lakers "insider" as saying it was Bryant's insistence on getting away from O'Neal that prompted the trade to Miami. Bryant told KLAC he knew who the so-called insider was, but wouldn't identify the person. Bryant also said he feels Buss misled him three years ago -- right before he re-signed with the Lakers -- by telling him one thing and Jackson something else about the team's goals. Bryant said he was told the Lakers would immediately try to rejoin the NBA's elite. But he said Jackson told him Tuesday that Buss was not bringing him back as coach following the 2003-04 season because the Lakers were committed to reducing payroll and rebuilding long term. "They said nothing to me about a long-term plan. Absolutely nothing," Bryant told KLAC. Contents copyright 1991-2006, The Hamilton Spectator. All rights reserved.

Bryant's surprising about-turn was sparked by a telephone conversation with Lakers head coach Phil Jackson. "I would like to be traded, yeah," Bryant told ESPN radio on Wednesday morning. "Tough as it is to come to that conclusion, there's no other alternative, you know?" Asked if he could be persuaded by the Lakers to stay in Los Angeles, the 28-year-old replied: "No, I just want them to do the right thing." Bryant, who helped the Lakers win three consecutive NBA championships from 2000-2002, has been frustrated by the team's lack of success over the last three seasons. An NBA veteran of 11 years, he has become increasingly disappointed by the rebuilding process since Shaquille O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004 and allegations that he was instrumental in prompting O'Neal's departure. "(The Lakers) obviously want to move in a different direction in terms of rebuilding," added Bryant, who signed a lucrative seven-year contract the day after O'Neal's trade. "Three years ago when I was re-signing they should have told me they wanted to rebuild." &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay) SAN ANTONIO &mdash; Tim Duncan and Tony Parker powered an early 14-0 spurt that featured perhaps the most dominant stretch the Spurs have played all postseason and the Utah Jazz never recovered, letting San Antonio cruise to a 109-84 victory Wednesday night and into the championship round for the third time in five years. The Spurs took all the suspense out of it by taking a 23-point lead early in the second quarter. Although Utah got an emotional lift at halftime when Derek Fisher arrived from New York, where his infant daughter was getting medical care for a rare eye condition, the only thing in doubt by then was whether San Antonio will play Detroit or Cleveland in the finals. The title series begins a week from Thursday in San Antonio, regardless of who comes out of the East. The Pistons-Cavaliers series is tied 2-2, with Game 5 on Thursday night in Detroit. "It's great, it's about the journey," Duncan said. "Last year we had a tough finish. This year to come back, put the team together and to go through three really, really good teams to get here, it's tremendous." Having a nine-day layoff before the next round was part of the motivation behind San Antonio's get-it-over-with approach to Game 5. After all, the Spurs have the oldest roster in the league, so they're both wise enough to value not giving the underdogs any hope and eager to avoid playing another trip to Salt Lake City. San Antonio led only 16-11 when the game-breaking stretch began with Parker cutting through several big guys and making a tough layup. Over the next 2:13, Parker had seven more points, plus a perfect lob that Duncan slammed with as much authority as he ever does. Then Bruce Bowen capped the blitz with a 3-pointer from the left corner that put the Spurs up 30-11. They'd made eight straight shots, were 12-of-16 for the game, and were outrebounding the Jazz 13-4. "Tonight we played great, everybody from the starting five to bench, everybody hit shots," Parker said. "I think we won that game in the first quarter." Duncan and Parker each finished with 21 points and Manu Ginobili scored only 12. None of them played in the fourth quarter _ it was that much of a blowout. By getting to the finals, San Antonio continues its bizarre trend of dominating the league in odd-numbered years since Duncan arrived for the 1997-98 season. The Spurs won it all in 1999, 2003 and '05, and even came close in the lone exception, losing the 2001 conference finals to the eventual champs, the Los Angeles Lakers. "It always feels good to be here," team owner Peter Holt said upon receiving the Western Conference trophy, a sparkling silver basketball, during an on-court presentation. "This is wonderful." "This is just part of the process," Bowen added, drawing a loud ovation. The looks on the faces of the Jazz players throughout the game showed their disappointment. However, star Carlos Boozer admitted Wednesday morning, "We're not even supposed to be here." Utah won 51 games and its division this season, but opened the playoffs on the road and lost the first two games. The Jazz rallied to beat Houston and got past eighth-seeded Golden State to reach the conference finals for the first time since 1998, yet were no match for the Spurs, especially in San Antonio. After taking a seven-point lead in the first quarter of the first game, Utah didn't lead during any of the other 11 quarters played here and has now lost 19 straight games on the Spurs' home court. Jazz coach Jerry Sloan may already have been looking ahead when he sent in Ronnie Brewer during the first half, figuring the experience would do the rookie some good in the long run. Brewer had played only two minutes this series and 24 all postseason. Late in the second quarter, Sloan used a lineup featuring deep reserves Brewer, Dee Brown and Rafael Araujo. Another rookie, Paul Millsap, joined that trio during the third quarter. Things were so out of hand by then that Fabricio Oberto took _ and made _ a 17-footer and 7-foot center Francisco Elson took _ and missed _ a 3-pointer at the buzzer. Point guard Deron Williams started for Utah despite a sprained right foot that had made him a game-time decision, but the game plan early apparently was to get shooters Andrei Kirilenko and Mehmet Okur out of their funks. Kirilenko took the Jazz's first two shots, making a dunk, and Okur took five in a row, making only one when the Spurs had their big run. It was their best stretch since Game 6 of the second round against Phoenix, when they turned a 63-61 lead with 5:23 left in the third quarter into a 20-point lead with nine minutes to play. Duncan actually went to the bench before the rally ended. Coach Gregg Popovich told him, "Good job," and Duncan walked by as if he'd done nothing special. All he got was a light pat on the rear when he left the game for good with a few minutes left in the third quarter. Kirilenko ended up leading Utah with 13 points. Williams and Matt Harpring each scored 11. Boozer had nine on 3-of-10 shooting and Fisher had only two free throws in 15 minutes. San Antonio's Jacque Vaughn dribbled out the clock to end the game _ sort of. There was still 0.3 seconds left on the clock, but Popovich shrugged and went to shake hands with Sloan and people began filling the floor. Officials scurried to get the Jazz to inbound the ball so time could run out. While the postgame ceremony was being set up, Utah players and coaches lined up to shake hands and hug the Spurs. Notes:@ Ever heard of a "correctable error?" The officials called one on themselves midway through the second quarter, realizing they'd called an offensive foul against Utah but not given San Antonio the free throws it was entitled to because the Jazz were over the limit. The Spurs had finished another possession when things were sorted out. ... The fourth quarter was such a joke that fans did the wave to entertain themselves. Former Spurs star David Robinson was among those getting up on cue. ... There are good storylines regardless of who San Antonio faces in the finals. Detroit would be a rematch of a tight 2005 finals, while Cleveland's coach (Mike Brown) and GM (Danny Ferry) came out of the Spurs' organization. ... Utah had been 2-0 when facing elimination this postseason, winning Games 6 and 7 of the Houston series. ... The Spurs improved to 13-4 in close-out games since 2003. Over the same span, they are now 7-2 in playoff series that feature a loss by at least 12 points. ... San Antonio won 58 regular-season games, more than Detroit (53) or Cleveland (50). That's why the finals will start in the Alamo City.

Briefing Room 2007 NFL Draft order NFL Hall of Fame Mavs' owner Cuban says pro football demand is greater than supply Updated: May 31, 2007, 12:19 PM ET owner Mark Cuban is part of a group considering formation of a football league that would compete with the NFL for players drafted lower than the second round. The league, still very much in the preliminary stage, would play its games on Friday nights. The NFL does not play then because of the potential conflict with high school football. Mosley: Footsteps In Distance? The United Football League is a complete long shot, but there's potential in the idea to intrigue, Matt Mosley writes. "It's a pretty simple concept," Cuban said in an e-mail to The Associated Press. "We think there is more demand for pro football than supply." The proposal was first disclosed by The New York Times on its Web site, which said it was the idea of Bill Hambrecht, a Wall Street investor who was a minority partner in the Oakland Invaders of the USFL, which played in the spring from 1983-85. Sharon Smith, a spokeswoman for Hambrecht and Company, had no comment and said Hambrecht was traveling and unavailable to talk about the idea. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said he was aware of the proposed league, but had no further comment. It's a pretty simple concept. We think there is more demand for pro football than supply. On his blog, Cuban explained how the new league, dubbed the UFL, would actually be good for the NFL. "The NFL wants and needs competition," Cuban wrote. "They have grown so big and powerful that every move they make is scrutinized by local or federal officials. A competitor allows them to point to us and explain that their moves are for competitive reasons rather than the move of a monopoly." There have been numerous leagues that have tried to compete with the NFL and a few that actually played games, starting with the AFL, which began in 1960 and fully merged with the NFL a decade later. It included such current franchises as New England, Oakland, Kansas City, San Diego, Buffalo, the New York Jets and Denver. More recently came the World Football League in the early 1970s, which raided the NFL for such stars as Larry Csonka. Then came the USFL, which played in the spring before folding after receiving only $3 in an antitrust "victory" over the NFL. The USFL featured such future Hall of Famers as Jim Kelly, Reggie White and Steve Young, but lost millions of dollars trying to compete for players. It also had internal struggles among a majority of owners who wanted to stay in the spring, and the best known among them, Donald Trump, who wanted to move to the fall and try to force a merger with the NFL. The most recent pro football league was the XFL, founded by the World Wrestling Federation and televised by NBC. The XFL lasted just three months in the spring of 2001 and was best known for a player named Rod Smart, called "He Hate Me," who later played as a return man and backup running back in the NFL. So far, the proposed new league is in its infancy and Cuban is the only potential owner for what the founders hope will be an eight-team league. Cuban said in his e-mail he believes the salary cap makes it easier to compete financially with the NFL because of the salary imbalance that leaves lower-level players with lower salaries. That would allow the new league to fill its rosters with players taken lower than the second round, as well as late NFL cuts and free agents who escape the NFL draft. Many such players, including , a sixth-round pick of New England, have become NFL stars. "That's not to say it will be easy. It won't," Cuban wrote. "We still have to cover quite a bit of ground and have a lot of milestones to hit. That said, if we can get the right owners I obviously think we can make this work." The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Justine Henin has slammed organisers for continuing with the Sunday start at the French Open. Sport : French Open Hewitt stages stunning comeback Hewitt excited by new court Wildcard no match for Federer Axed Roche to coach Hewitt? Paris - Lleyton Hewitt staged a trademark barnstorming comeback from two sets down on Thursday to beat 2004 champion Gaston Gaudio and reach the French Open third round. Hewitt&#39;s marathon 4-6 3-6 6-2 6-4 6-2 victory was the fourth time in his career, and the second time in successive Grand Slams, that he had performed such a stunning turnaround. While the Australian 14th seed looks forward to a third round clash against Finland&#39;s Jarkko Nieminen, the result looks likely to hasten the 28-year-old Gaudio&#39;s decision to ponder retirement. The Argentinian, who has slipped to 72 in the world after once reaching five, had already expressed his frustration at life on the tour after a dismal 2007 where he has only once won two matches in a row. Hewitt had looked destined to suffer his worst performance in Paris since making a first round exit on his debut in 1999 when he was second best in the opening two sets. The first lasted 62 minutes with the Australian failing to convert any of his four break points before Gaudio, who beat compatriot Guillermo Coria in a memorable five-set 2004 final, soon taking a two sets lead. But Hewitt is the king of lost causes. He cut back on the unforced errors in the third set which he took with breaks in the third and seventh games and then levelled the contest against a ragged Gaudio by snatching the fourth as the Argentinian&#39;s game imploded. Hewitt broke in the first and fifth games of the decider and took the match with a love service game after 3hrs 28min on Court Philippe Chatrier when Gaudio hit a lazy, tired forehand long. Hewitt had to come back from two sets down to beat Michael Russell in the first round of this year&#39;s Australian Open. His first such dramatic recovery came against Guillermo Canas in the fourth round here in 2001, and the second was in 2003 when he beat Roger Federer in a Davis Cup semi-final.

Old stereotypes dominated the Duke Lacrosse case Titans star finally gets his due, but big-time sports is still soft on bad boys Red Wings fellow travelers need to change their ways You can bet itâ€™s cashâ€”not qualityâ€”thatâ€™s keeping many deserving mid-majors out of the NCAA menâ€™s basketball tournament Nashvilleâ€™s real passion is for A-list status, not hockey For many Nashvillians, the impending sale of the Predatorsâ€”viewed in these parts as a hostile takeover, or like the invasion of a Super WalMart without the low pricesâ€”seemed to revolve not just around financial or even geographical questions but an existential one. After the initial shock and â€œAw, ****!sâ€ from locals in the wake of the announcement, it appears that our city is safe for now. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman himself says the Preds arenâ€™t going anywhere (as long as Metro is willing to pay to keep the team obligated to its lease). But even if the Predators arenâ€™t removed to some B-list North American city like Hamilton or Winnipeg, does the sale signify that Nashville itself has lost its claim to the A-list? Does it mean that those condescending hockey snobs across the border have been right to claim that an NHL franchise couldnâ€™t thrive among football-loving, NASCAR-crazed, booger-eating bumpkins like us? How do we feel about ourselves? Not so good. The Snobs already told us smugly that this would happen. The year before the 2004 lockout, a poll found that NHL general managers regarded Nashville as the franchise least likely to succeed. Few things are more grating to our Southern self-esteem than to be told-you-soâ€™ed by foreigners. Itâ€™s worse, of course, when one of those is the guy whoâ€™s buying your team. The would-be purchaser, Jim Balsillie, didnâ€™t attend the news conference last week when the sale was announced (not exactly an encouraging sign of interest in Music City). He reportedly told Bettman that he has no plans to relocate the franchise. All we can say with certainty is that Balsillie is responsible for BlackBerry devices and, thereby, for crimes against civilization. Worst of all is the looming recognition that Nashville has no alibis for the told-you-soâ€™ers. We didnâ€™t want hockey because of our passion for the game. We wanted it as a sign of our arrival as a big-league city. We said weâ€™d nurture it, the way eager little kids vow to care for downy Easter ducklings that wind up dumped beside a lake or, if theyâ€™re lucky, in new homes by summer. Once the Titans fell into our laps and the Predators were no longer the only game in town, Nashvilliansâ€”especially corporate ticket-buyersâ€”followed their real passion. According to Bettman, Nashville is the only NHL city where corporations buy fewer season tickets than individual fans. If the Preds donâ€™t average at least 14,000 in paid attendance for two consecutive seasonsâ€”they recorded 13,815 per game last yearâ€”the team can buy out its lease and leave. But Metro can keep the lease in effect (and the team in town) by making up for any shortfall. Blameless, in my book, is the seller, Craig Leipold. He tried. After the NHLâ€™s new collective bargaining agreement took effect, he shelled out heavily for talent, in the apparent hope that a big winner on the ice would put many more butts in the seats. Had the Preds advanced beyond the first round of the playoffs, of course, the attendance clause in their contract with the city would have been moot. Getting to the second round would have meant additional sellout crowds that would have put per-game average over the threshold. Itâ€™s not Leipoldâ€™s fault that it didnâ€™t happen. Nor should anyone reasonably expect him to increase his investment on a team that has lost him, as he claims, $27 million over the past two years, and $70 million over the past decade. And though the accounting of many big-league franchises is notoriously suspectâ€”some clubs could rake in the ransom of Atahuallpa and still manage to show a loss on paperâ€”thereâ€™s no special reason to believe that Leipold is torturing his numbers. Most owners, after all, donâ€™t look to sell a franchise thatâ€™s turning a profit. Nor do they become teary-eyed, as Leipold did, in admitting, â€œI cannot make it work here.â€ For all the civic angst of the past week, however, all is not lost. Certainly the franchise isnâ€™t. Though Balsillieâ€”who also tried to purchase the Pittsburgh Penguinsâ€”has said he wants to bring a club to Canada, itâ€™s hard to see how he could squeeze this team into his beloved Ontario even if Nashville gives him an out by failing to buy enough tickets. Hamilton, his presumed first choice, is way too close to Toronto and Buffalo. Buying into the NHL ainâ€™t exactly like getting a Subway franchise. The other Ontario suspects are much smaller than Nashville (and already populated with Maple Leafs fans). Winnipeg has already lost one NHL team. And even if ticket sales fall below the magic number of 14,000 next year, city officials seem ready to fight in court. From the reading of the contract by Metroâ€™s Legal Department, the Preds couldnâ€™t terminate their lease until 2009. There is, of course, another possibility. If ticket sales push the attendance average above 14,000, the lease is unbreakable. And that means that, in effect, the real owners of the Predators are the residents and corporate leaders of the Nashville area. The next move literally is up to us.

SAN ANTONIO EASE THROUGH TO FINALS Subscribe to RSS Feed The San Antonio Spurs clinched a spot in the NBA Finals with a 109-84 drubbing of the Utah Jazz, to win the Western Conference finals series 4-1. San Antonio - who led by 29 at one stage in the game - never trailed in the game, and thanks to a first quarter in which they pounded the Jazz 34-15, they always looked comfortable. "Our first quarter was unbelievable," said Spurs star Tony Parker, "I can't remember, since I've been with the Spurs, shooting the ball like that. Our offense was great, our defense was great. You can't ask for a better start." Parker and Tim Duncan scored 21 points each in the victory, while Manu Ginobili was once again the star from the bench, netting 12. The Spurs defence showed their own kind of spirit, limiting Utah's Carlos Boozer to just nine points, and strike partner Deron Williams to a mere 11. Boozer, however, did manage to get in double figures in the rebounds department with 12. Andrei Kirilenko was Utah's top scorer with 13 points, while Matt Harpring also put up 11. "They came at us really hard," Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. "They destroyed our will to want to play. That was the whole thing. We abandoned our offense right away. And we never could get back into it the rest of the night. They put us where they wanted us all night long." The first game of the NBA Finals begins next Thursday in San Antonio.

It appears as this time the teams have the upper-hand on NASCAR as the sanctioning body is considering opening up its restrictive testing policies. Teams are currently limited to seven tests on Nextel Cup-sanctioned tracks, with the crew chiefs assisting in the deciding of the various venues. NASCAR instituted that policy two years ago in an effort to assist under-funded teams while trying to keep big-budget teams on an even playing field. With the emergence of NASCAR's new Car of Tomorrow, which is being used at 16 of 36 events this season, teams have found ways of doing extra testing without breaking the rules. "It appears that we've got teams that want to test more and teams that want to test less, and teams that test on tires that are not made by our tire supplier," Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's Vice President of competition, told AP on Wednesday. "So we're going to start looking at a lot of different things, from eventually lifting the test ban completely, or get as restrictive as we cannot let teams test anywhere at any time, or land somewhere in between." In an effort to assist their learning curve with the new COT, teams have been testing at other non-NASCAR tracks while using old Goodyear tires or tires from other suppliers. On Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, more than 20 teams got in some road-course work at Virginia International Raceway in preparation for the two road-course stops - Infineon and Watkins Glen -- on the Nextel Cup schedule. So long as it is a non-sanctioned track, any team can go there for testing and still be within NASCAR's guidelines. Teams can't use current Goodyear tires because of a leasing agreement intended to prevent extracurricular testing. NASCAR said the teams have, technically, not broken the rules. Hendrick Motorsports, which has won nine of the 12 races this season and all of the COT events, said it has used various test drivers about 30 times this year, and rival car owner Jack Roush said his five-car team is behind because it didn't purchase tires from Hoosier or B.F. Goodrich for testing purposes. "The teams that have been successful ... they've gone to tracks outside NASCAR's control with tires that were not from Goodyear," Roush told the AP. "Right now, Goodyear is sitting on millions of dollars worth of tires that are growing obsolete and hard in their warehouses. Teams have gotten around NASCAR's policy by buying other people's tires and testing at tracks that aren't on the Nextel Cup schedule. I got behind on that. I didn't do that." Testing other tires only gives teams a ballpark idea of where they expect to be on race day and many crew chiefs have said the only true test is by using the current Goodyear's. Still, apparently many teams are willing to take that gamble. Copyright © AHN Media Corp - All rights reserved.

Spurs first into finals Tim Duncan (l) and Carlos Boozer of the Utah Jazz: The finals will be booze free [GALLO/GETTY] Tim Duncan and Tony Parker led the San Antonio Spurs into their third NBA final series in five years after they cruised past the Utah Jazz 109-84 to wrap up the Western Conference finals 4-1. The Spurs made light work of Game Five taking a 23-point lead early in the second quarter. The finals begin a week from Thursday in San Antonio, regardless of who comes out of the East. The Pistons-Cavaliers series is tied 2-2, with Game 5 on Thursday in Detroit. "It's great, it's about the journey," Duncan said. "Last year we had a tough finish, this year to come back, put the team together and to go through three really, really good teams to get here, it's tremendous." Having a nine-day break before the finals was part of the motivation behind San Antonio's up tempo approach to Game 5. After all, the Spurs have the oldest roster in the league, so they're both wise enough to value not giving the underdogs any hope and eager to avoid another trip to Utah. San Antonio led only 16-11 when the game-breaking stretch began with Parker cutting through several big guys and making a tough layup. Tim Duncan: Looking to for his third Over the next 2:13, Parker had seven more points, plus a perfect lob that Duncan slammed with as much authority as he ever does. Then Bruce Bowen capped the blitz with a 3-pointer from the left corner that put the Spurs up 30-11. They'd made eight straight shots, were 12-of-16 for the game, and were outrebounding the Jazz 13-4. "Tonight we played great, everybody from the starting five to bench, everybody hit shots," Parker said. "I think we won that game in the first quarter." Duncan and Parker each finished with 21 points and Manu Ginobili scored only 12. None of them played in the fourth quarter, by then it was all over. Odd years, good years By getting to the finals, San Antonio continues its bizarre trend of dominating the league in odd-numbered years since Duncan arrived for the 1997-98 season. The Spurs won it all in 1999, 2003 and '05, and even came close in the lone exception, losing the 2001 conference finals to the eventual champs, the Los Angeles Lakers. The looks on the faces of the Jazz players showed their disappointment Andrei Kirilenko ended up leading Utah with 13 points. Deron Williams and Matt Harpring each scored 11. Carlos Boozer had nine on 3-of-10 shooting and Fisher had only two free throws in 15 minutes. In their first conference finals since 1998, the Jazz were no match for the Spurs, especially in San Antonio. After taking a seven-point lead in the first quarter of the first game, Utah didn't lead during any of the other 11 quarters played here and has now lost 19 straight games on the Spurs' home court.

Story published at magicvalley.com on Thursday, May 31, 2007 Last modified on Thursday, May 31, 2007 12:45 AM MDT Los Angeles Angels' Vladimir Guerrero watches the flight of his three-run home run in the fifth inning of an MLB baseball game against the Seattle Mariners in Anaheim, Calif., Wednesday, May 30, 2007. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) Guerrero's 3-Run Homer Lifts Angels 8-6 ANAHEIM, Calif. - It isn't often the Los Angeles Angels get home runs from their 3-4-5 hitters in the same game. They came at the right time, because Jered Weaver didn't have his best stuff. Vladimir Guerrero hit a go-ahead, three-run shot off Felix Hernandez, Gary Matthews Jr. and Casey Kotchman hit consecutive home runs in the first, and the Angels bullpen preserved an 8-6 win over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night. "It's good, because there are going to be sometimes when we're not going to do well offensively and our pitchers pick us up and keep us in close ballgames," Guerrero said through a translator. "We have a good pitching staff, and hopefully all of us can contribute to them." Guerrero's homer was his first since May 17 at Seattle. It hasn't been easy getting good pitches to hit, because everyone is pitching around the 2004 AL MVP. Guerrero's greatest strength is he is one of the game's best bad-ball hitters. "I can't get frustrated because it's part of the game. I've been saying that for a long time," Guerrero said. "I don't get frustrated because I trust the people that hit behind me. The home runs just happen when they happen. I don't worry about when they come or when they don't come. But I'm very happy that this one came tonight." Dustin Moseley (4-0) got the win in relief of Weaver, who was pulled after 4 2-3 innings with the Angels down 5-4. After Guerrero's homer put Los Angeles ahead 7-5, Moseley pitched two innings and gave up an RBI double to Raul Ibanez that cut the Angels' edge to 7-6 in the sixth. But Scot Shields pitched a perfect eighth and Francisco Rodriguez worked the ninth for his 18th save in 19 chances. Hernandez (3-3) allowed seven runs and nine hits in seven innings. He surrendered his first three homers of the season, as the Angels took the rubber game of the series and extended their lead in the AL West to 5 1/2 games over the second-place Mariners. "We were a little disappointed because we felt we had a chance to win the game with our ace on the mound," Adrian Beltre said. "It didn't happen, but we're going to get a chance to face these guys again, and hopefully we can do better next time. We've got four months left, so one series is not going to make a difference right now." Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak to 23 games _ tying his career best in 2001. The two-time AL batting champion is within one game of the franchise record set by Joey Cora in 1997. Weaver had won his previous three starts, and the Angels gave him a 4-1 lead in the first inning. But the Mariners made it 4-all on Beltre's RBI double in the fifth and Yuniesky Betancourt followed with an RBI single that finished the right-hander. "My command just really wasn't there," Weaver said. "The off-speed stuff felt great, but I was struggling with my fastball command. I just couldn't make my pitches and they put some good swings on the ball." Pinch-hitter Robb Quinlan drove in an insurance run in the Angels seventh with a sacrifice fly that Betancourt caught. The shortstop made an over-the-shoulder catch in short left-center field and couldn't get the ball home fast enough after Reggie Willits tagged up. Guerrero had a chance to break open the game in the eighth, but struck out with the bases loaded against Brandon Morrow. The rookie reliever extended his scoreless streak to 15 2-3 consecutive innings. The Mariners wrapped up a 6-4 road trip that began with a makeup game in Cleveland and continued through Tampa Bay, Kansas City and Anaheim. When they return to Seattle, the journey will have covered 6,273 miles. "It's going to be good to get back home," Beltre said. "We finished the road trip over .500 and we could have done better, but it was a good trip." Notes:@ Angels infielder Erick Aybar started at third base for the first time in his professional career. Normally a second baseman, he made a neat play on the first batter of the game, making a diving stop on Suzuki's grounder in the hole and throwing him out from one knee. ... Angels RHP Bartolo Colon's next scheduled start on Sunday was pushed back to June 8, when the club opens a nine-game road trip at St. Louis. The 2005 AL Cy Young winner, experiencing tightness in his triceps since early this month, has allowed 15 runs in 10 2-3 innings over his last two starts.

The Australian, seeded 14th and one of the dark horses for the title, is known for his grit and determination and he needed it as he claimed a 4-6 3-6 6-2 6-4 6-2 win in almost three-and-a-half hours on Philippe Chatrier court. Gaudio, the 2004 champion, looked in control when two sets up, but he is consistent for his inconsistency, and allowed Hewitt to launch an all-too-familiar fightback. After seeing himself pegged back to two sets all, Gaudio trudged back to his seat after being broken in the opening game of the decider. Hewitt had no further problems and set up a third-round clash with Finn Jarkko Nieminen, but he admitted Gaudio caused him all sorts of problems early on. “He was probably one of the toughest second-round matches you can get here,” said the former world number one, who lost to Gaudio during the Argentinian’s run to the title three years ago. “He was hitting his backhand great, and he wasn’t missing many balls. It was a matter of just hanging in there, and just focusing on winning one set at a time. “It does make it hard playing a guy like that. He is going to have his ups and downs, and you just don’t know what you are going to get from him.” Nieminen, seeded 20, thrashed Mathieu Montcourt, of France, 6-1 6-1 6-4 on Court 3, and Hewitt is expecting a tough next match. “He is a good player,” he added. “He is a left-hander, but good off both sides. It will be a different kind of match to this one.” Marcos Baghdatis had it almost as straightforward as Nieminen in his second-round match. The Cypriot defeated Denmark’s Kristian Pless 7-5 6-3 6-4 on Court 1 to reach the third round at Roland Garros for the first time in three attempts. He will next play Jan Hajek, who beat fellow Czech Bohdan Ulihrach in five sets. Baghdatis, seeded 16, made his name in the tennis world by reaching the final of the Australian Open last year, before losing to Roger Federer. He has also made it to the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 2006, but he is now beginning to feel at home on the dirt. “I didn’t play so good on clay last year, I had some difficulties,” said the Paris-based player. “Slowly, slowly, I’m finding my game on clay, starting to feel the way I have to play. I don’t see why here, I can’t play like I do on the hard and grass courts.” Meanwhile, Serbia’s Novak Djokovic, the sixth seed, secured a four-set victory over Frenchman Laurent Recouderc. The 20-year-old Djokovic, a quarter-finalist at Roland Garros last year, won 6-3 3-6 6-3 6-1 on Suzanne Lenglen court. Croat Ivo Ljubicic joined him in the third round thanks to a 6-4 6-3 6-7 (3/7) 6-3 triumph over Switzerland’s Stanislas Wawrinka. And Spanish duo Carlos Moya and David Ferrer also progressed with comfortable wins against Florent Serra and Diego Hartfield, respectively. Moya, seeded 23, won 6-4 6-2 6-4 and 12th-seed Ferrer prevailed 6-4 6-3 7-6 (7/4). Other winners on Thursday were Olivier Patience, who defeated Mariano Zabaleta in five sets, and Juan Pablo Brzezicki – a straight-sets victor against Guillermo Garcia-Lopez.

Story published at magicvalley.com on Thursday, May 31, 2007 Last modified on Thursday, May 31, 2007 2:46 AM MDT Tiger Woods tees off on the 10th hole at the pro-am for the Memorial golf tournament Wednesday, May 30, 2007 at the Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato) Is Mickelson Ready to Challenge Woods? DUBLIN, Ohio - Masters champion Zach Johnson is here. So are eight of the top 10 players in the world. Yet all anyone seems to notice is the looming duel between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. Both were peppered with questions about a potential showdown in this week's Memorial Tournament. Woods is No. 1 on the planet by acclaim, not even close. But that doesn't stop everybody from trying to speculate about who could sneak up and steal his crown. "I've had different guys make different runs," Woods said after Wednesday's pro-am at Muirfield Village Golf Club. "It was (David) Duval and then probably Phil and Ernie (Els), Vijay (Singh), Goose (Retief Goosen) _ a combination of those guys throughout the years." With Mickelson coming off a big win at The Players Championship three weeks ago, some are saying he may be primed to challenge Woods at the Memorial and then in two weeks at the U.S. Open at Oakmont. Mickelson isn't so sure. "It's flattering _ to me, anyway," he joked of the comparisons between him and Woods. "Probably not to him, but it's flattering to me." It seems that every time Mickelson gets a big win _ the Masters in 2004, the PGA Championship in 2005, the Masters again in 2006 _ it gets Woods' attention. A year ago, for instance, Mickelson won at Augusta and was in position to take his second major in a row before hitting that hideous drive on the final hole that cost him the Open at Winged Foot. Still grieving the loss of his father, Woods wasn't a factor there, but then turned around and won the last two majors, the British Open and PGA. With Woods facing impending fatherhood and the changes that can bring, now could be the time for Mickelson to finally challenge for the top spot in the world. Woods doesn't seem to be conceding anything, though. "As long as I'm up there in the conversation, I'm doing all right," Woods said. "I keep pushing myself pretty hard, regardless. I always try and get better. You can't stay stagnant in any sport. You've always got to keep getting better because you know the guys are training harder, they're finding their game, they're in the gym, you're getting better athletes playing the game. So you've got to keep getting better." Mickelson, leading the tour in putting average, knows how difficult the task is. "It's a tough feat. I mean, we're talking about probably the best player of all time," he said. Memorial Tournament founder Jack Nicklaus was asked if anyone is capable of pressing Woods. "All I know is that Tiger is dominating what's going on. And when he plays and when he's playing well, he is really difficult to beat," Nicklaus said. "We can say that the guys today can't finish and Tiger is the only guy that can play, or we can say that the guys today are really, really good and Tiger is just way above them. We never will have an answer for that." Either way, Mickelson is not giving up. He's lost weight, is halfway through restructuring his swing and is optimistic heading into the Memorial _ a tournament Woods has won three times. Mickelson has never finished in the top three. "A lot of great players have won this tournament. I have not," he said. "It's one of the tour events that I would very much like to win." The field mirrors that of a major. Nine of the top 10 money-winners are on hand, along with former Memorial winners Els, Jim Furyk, Singh, Tom Lehman and Paul Azinger. Johnson, still on a victory lap after winning the Masters in April and the AT&T Classic two weeks ago, burns to remain in such elite company. "This is one of my favorite places to be," said Johnson, who tied for second at the Memorial a year ago, two shots behind winner Carl Pettersson. "Golfwise, I absolutely love it. If you find a complaint here, it's hard." A service of the Associated Press(AP) Copyright &copy; 2006, Lee Publications Inc.

NEW YORK - Barry Zito was the highest profile free agent pitcher on the market this winter, the New York Mets had a glaring need in their rotation, and their fans are used to getting spendy gifts at Christmas. Maybe that's why Mets fans showered Zito with colorful language while the Giants left-hander warmed up in the Shea Stadium bullpen Wednesday night. "It's always great coming to New York," Zito said. "You get all those trash talkers saying everything they can think of. That's what makes this place special." Zito showed them what they're missing. He held the high-powered Mets lineup scoreless over seven innings and struck out a season-high seven batters in a 3-0 victory at Flushing Meadows. The Mets hadn't been shut out this season. It was an important bounce-back victory for the Giants, who lost in 12 innings Tuesday night when Armando Benitez had a balk-a-thon on the mound. Brad Hennessey became the closer Wednesday because Benitez had an inflamed right knee. It was an important prove-it start for Zito, especially after anonymous Mets officials chirped about his tame fastball and decried the &#36;126 million the Giants showered upon him. "You know, I don't really want to pitch with any kind of vendetta against people," Zito said. "For me, it's just about being aggressive, throwing strikes and hoping for the best." Zito's 84 mph fastball worked just fine because he spotted it on the corners and dropped in both varieties of his breaking ball for strikes. He walked only one batter and he gave the Giants innings on a day they needed to go light on their bullpen. Since walking seven in his May 18 loss at Oakland, Zito is 2-0 and has issued just three walks over 14 innings. "A lot was said about him pitching here, but we needed it," Giants Manager Bruce Bochy said. "He can pitch. He'll throw a lot of great back-to-back games. That's why we got him. He showed what he's about tonight." Zito had a good support network behind him. Pedro Feliz hit a two-out, two-run single off Tom Glavine in the first inning and lined an RBI triple in the third. Bengie Molina worked an eight-pitch walk in the first to extend the rally; Molina also singled on a lengthy at-bat ahead of Feliz's triple. Shortstop Omar Vizquel was 0 for 4 but contributed an assortment of highlight plays, including bare-handed pickups to throw out Endy Chavez in the first and Damion Easley in the fourth. And Rich Aurilia broke out of a 5-for-51 slump by tying his career high with four hits. Aurilia, whose stiff neck is coming around, said he made adjustments after teammates noticed a flaw in his approach. Barry Bonds singled and scored in the first inning but otherwise had a quiet 1-for-3 night with an intentional walk. Bonds was just as nondescript before the game, when he relented to the New York media throng and repeated his non-thoughts on the home run record, Bud Selig and Hank Aaron. After the game, the cameras and reporters awaited the other Barry. New York might be special, but it's not easy being a visible baseball star here. You needed only to look at the cover of Wednesday's New York Post, which splashed photos of Yankees star Alex Rodriguez getting into a hotel elevator with a blond woman who wasn't his wife. The headlines were "Stray-Rod" and "A-Rod's A Yankee Doodle Randy." The fans in the outfield at Shea weren't nearly as clever. "Nah, not creative at all," Zito said. "Just blatant expletives right at me." Contact Andrew Baggarly at abaggarly@mercurynews.com The Mercury News is pleased to let readers post comments about an article at the end of the article.

(AP Photo/Terry Renna) CHARLOTTE, N.C. - NASCAR is considering opening up its restrictive testing policy, which several teams already have skirted this season. Currently, rules limit teams to seven tests on Nextel Cup-sanctioned tracks, and crew chiefs help NASCAR decide the venues and dates. NASCAR adopted that policy two years ago to help underfunded teams keep up with big-budget organizations, who could afford to test anytime. But as the Car of Tomorrow was rolled into competition, the top teams found ways to test it outside of the rules. "It appears that we've got teams that want to test more and teams that want to test less, and teams that test on tires that are not made by our tire supplier," Robin Pemberton, NASCAR vice president of competition, told The Associated Press on Wednesday. "So we're going to start looking at a lot of different things, from eventually lifting the test ban completely, or get as restrictive as we cannot let teams test anywhere at any time, or land somewhere in between." NASCAR most likely will relax the restrictions, because it's having a hard time policing teams. More than 20 teams tested Tuesday and Wednesday at Virginia International Raceway, a road course where they could simulate the June 24 race in Sonoma, Calif. Because VIR is not a sanctioned track, any team can go there and still be within NASCAR's guidelines. But teams can't use current Goodyear tires because of a leasing agreement intended to prevent extracurricular testing. To circumvent the lack of available tires, teams have started using other manufacturers for test sessions. They also snapped up much of Goodyear's inventory from 2005 and earlier. Goodyear officials declined a request from The Associated Press for comment Wednesday, and NASCAR said the teams have not technically broken the rules. Hendrick Motorsports, winners of nine of the first 12 races this season, is believed to have lapped the field in testing this year. Team officials said they've used a variety of test drivers about 30 times this year, and rival car owner Jack Roush said that's unfair. He said his own five-car team is behind the competition, because he didn't purchase tires from Hoosier or B.F. Goodrich for tests. "The teams that have been successful ... they've gone to tracks outside NASCAR's control with tires that were not from Goodyear," Roush said. "Right now, Goodyear is sitting on millions of dollars worth of tires that are growing obsolete and hard in their warehouses. Teams have gotten around NASCAR's policy by buying other people's tires and testing at tracks that aren't on the Nextel Cup schedule. "I got behind on that. I didn't do that." But using tires other than what Goodyear provides on race day is a crapshoot, many crew chiefs said. "Relaxing the testing policy only makes sense if we can use current Goodyears," said Mike Ford, crew chief for Denny Hamlin. "You can really end up going pretty far down the wrong road that way, but you have no choice because everyone is doing it." Hamlin tested at VIR on "some really old Goodyears," but Ford said it was only the second time this season the No. 11 team has gone outside a NASCAR-sanctioned test. Joe Gibbs Racing's research and development team has tested cars at various times independent of Hamlin's team this year. Ford said he believes NASCAR's prohibitive policy created the testing problems. "They are forcing teams to spend money with other tire manufacturers instead of with Goodyear, the company NASCAR supports," he said. "One way or the other, everybody is going to test."

Pujols, Cards pound Rockies Albert Pujols speaks with FSN Midwest after his two hits and three RBI helped the Cardinals snap the Rockies' seven-game win streak. But now that he's gotten a taste of starting, life won't be the same for him. "I'm liking starting," Wellemeyer said. Wellemeyer earned a victory in his first major league start, hit consecutive homers in the fifth, and St. Louis beat Colorado 8-4 Wednesday night to end the ' seven-game winning streak. Wellemeyer can now be added to the list of relievers the have successfully converted into starters this season. St. Louis has turned into winning starters in 2007. Wellemeyer had 119 career relief appearances before his first start. "That was impressive as well as the are playing," manager Tony La Russa said. Wellemeyer knows he has things to work on - like a windup. Wellemeyer (1-0) worked out of the stretch from the first pitch. The 28-year-old righty, claimed off waivers by St. Louis on May 15, lasted five innings, giving up seven hits and three runs. "It's been almost two years (since I threw from the windup)," he said. "I'm going to start throwing it on the side." Wellemeyer also had his second career hit, an RBI single in the fifth. "I'm loving hitting," he said. "I'm liking some more at-bats." The heart of the ' lineup - Pujols, Edmonds and - broke out in a big way. The trio went a combined 7-for-14 with two homers, two doubles, a triple and six RBIs. "When those three guys hit, we have a chance to score a lot of runs," La Russa said. hit back-to-back homers for the first time this season. Pujols drove a three-run homer off to left-center field - his ninth of the season - and Edmonds hit the next pitch to right for his fifth. The tied a season high with five runs in the fifth inning. "They have a good offense," said , who had three hits, including his 10th homer of the season. "Albert, Scott and Jim - those guys have been great for a long time.

The win ended St. Louis' seven-game road losing streak. were attempting to win eight in a row for the first time since Aug. 26-Sept. 2, 1997. But they're not dwelling on the streak that was halted. "We need to try to keep playing good baseball," said Holliday, who leads the majors in three-hit games with 10. hit a solo homer to right in the second inning. Hawpe has hit three homers in as many nights and has eight this season. He also drove a pitch from deep to right with two on in the eighth, but caught it with his back to the wall. Johnson gave up a homer to Hawpe the night before. La Russa said he didn't bring in Johnson for a rematch. "I think (Hawpe) has struggled with lefties and Tyler gets lefties out," La Russa explained. Hirsh (2-5) was pulled after 4 2-3 innings and giving up eight runs. He allowed a career-high 10 hits. "I didn't have my good stuff," Hirsh said. "I couldn't find my command for anything." While the heart of the St. Louis order may have broken out Wednesday night, Edmonds said it's going to take a lot more games like this to pronounce them back. "We haven't swung the bats well this year," Edmonds said. "So we've gotten off to a slow start, and we've got a lot of making up to do." found out Wednesday that catcher will be sidelined four to six weeks with a fractured left wrist.

(AP) - Kentucky Derby winner Street Sense will skip the Belmont Stakes so trainer Carl Nafzger can prepare his colt for the Travers Stakes and Breeders' Cup Classic later this year. Nafzger said he talked to owner James Tafel for two hours Wednesday night before deciding against a rematch with Preakness winner Curlin in the final leg of the Triple Crown. "The competitive side said 'Go,' the logical side said 'No, no, no,"' Nafzger said. Nafzger said they will aim toward the summer and fall schedule that features the Travers and Breeders' Cup. "Mr. Tafel said let's not chase spilled water," Nafzger said. "We spilled our water during the Preakness. We got beat. We got outran." Street Sense and jockey Calvin Borel appeared headed to the Belmont to chase the Triple Crown when he took the lead deep in the stretch at the Preakness, only to have Curlin and jockey Robby Albarado slip by at the wire. So with the opportunity of being the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978 gone, Tafel wants his colt to chase the possibility of becoming the first horse to win the Derby, the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, the Travers and the Breeders' Cup Classic. The Travers is Aug. 25 at Saratoga. The Breeders' Cup Classic is Oct. 27 at Monmouth Park. Nafzger said there was a concern that Street Sense wouldn't have time to get properly prepared for the Travers if he ran the 1 1/2-mile Belmont. The horse will be able to rest and compete in one or two races between now and the Travers, including possibly the Jim Dandy. "I know there's disappointment we're not going to the Belmont," Nafzger said. "But somewhere we want to make another stand."

The day went almost without incident as Tony Stewart had an engine problem almost as soon as he hit the track in the morning. Then Denny Hamlin had a differential failure late in the day, causing the car to be towed in behind a team truck. The best lap times of the day, on VIR's 2.25-mile North Course, hovered just under one minute, twenty-nine seconds, but differences in tires and sometimes in time of day, make absolute comparisons meaningless. Several teams had laps around 1:28.8, including Bobby Labonte, Marcos Ambrose, and the Hendrick team's development driver. With the wide variety of tires used, Labonte joked that at Sonoma, at least everyone would be on the same tires. He also expressed hope that they would be "better" than the tires used last weekend at Lowe's Motor Speedway's Coca Cola 600, where some teams elected not to change tires for one or two fuel stops. Testing continues on Wednesday, with several teams leaving after Tuesday's testing ended, but several more expected. Teams expected to test on Wednesday include Hendrick, Joe Gibbs, DEI, RCR, Petty, Hall of Fame Racing, Ray Evernham and several others. &copy; 1994-2007 Motorsport.com, Inc. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson) Neil Stevens, Canadian Press Published: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 ANAHEIM, Calif. (CP) - The Moen homestead was the place to be in Stewart Valley on Monday night. With family and friends gathered to watch Travis Moen play hockey on TV, the tiny Saskatchewan farming community's most famous son potted the goal that gave the Anaheim Ducks a 3-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators in the opening game of the NHL's championship series. "I know my mom had 15 or 20 people over watching so there were a lot of fans at the family home," he said after stripping off his pads. "They're just really excited to see me in the Stanley Cup playoffs so it's pretty exciting." Brother Brant supplied the beer, he guessed, and his mom would have prepared the food. There was only 2:51 remaining when the six-foot-two, 218-pound left-winger swung at a bouncing puck and sent it past goaltender Ray Emery and into a bottom corner of the Ottawa net, lifting most of the 17,274 cheering spectators out of their Honda Center seats and delighting everyone in Stewart Valley. "I kind of got lucky," said Moen. "The puck was bouncing but I got it on net and it snuck in. "It was a great feeling." Moen skates on a checking line with Rob Niedermayer and Sammy Pahlsson. It shut down the most productive line in these playoffs - Jason Spezza between Dany Heatley and Daniel Alfredsson. "They're three world-class players so it's definitely a challenge to limit their space and play physical against them," said Moen. Spezza had his worst outing of the spring. Moen scored his fifth goal of the post-season - and his second winner. He had scored only 11 goals in 82 regular-season games. "You can never get too used to it," he replied when asked if he's getting used to being a scorer. "It's definitely a good feeling. "I had a chance earlier, kind of a half breakaway I wish I could have back, but all 20 of our guys battled hard. I was just lucky to put one in." Moen, 25, will be returning to the farm this summer to help cut and bale hay for winter feed. The way the Ducks played on the U.S. Memorial Day holiday, the Senators may soon be cut and baled. Andy McDonald of Strathroy, Ont., and Ryan Getzlaf, another Saskatchewan product - born in Regina - scored Anaheim's other goals. The Ducks outshot Ottawa 32-20 and would have won by a greater margin had not Emery played so well. The Ducks laid on 30 hits compared to 21 by the Senators. "We used our forecheck and were physical," said McDonald. "I thought as the game went along we wore their defence down a bit and I thought that was a factor." The persistent checking paid off as Anaheim committed five giveaways and Ottawa 14. Ottawa scored first, Mike Fisher of Peterborough, Ont., connecting 1:38 in, and led 2-1 after 40 minutes on a blast by Lloydminster, Sask.-born Wade Redden past Montreal-raised Jean-Sebastien Giguere.

It has been 14-years since a Canadian team last sipped from Lord Stanley's famous mug and following two one-goal defeats in Southern California, fretful Canadians have been left to wonder if the treasured trophy will ever return to hockey's birth place. There is good reason for anxiety in the Canadian capital, which will host Game Three of the series on Saturday. Since the NHL adopted the best-of-seven format in 1939, the home team has swept the opening two games 30 times and only once (the Chicago Blackhawks in 1971) failed to go on to win the Cup. While history and momentum are with Anaheim, the Ducks know their job is only half done. "We've kind of done our job, we've won our two home games and let's face it, you're supposed to win your home games," Ducks all-star defenceman Chris Pronger told reporters following Anaheim's Game Two win. "Now it's in their court. "We're going to expect a tougher environment in their building." Despite the dire situation facing the Senators, Stanley Cup fever has gripped Canada with everyone from Prime Minister Stephen Harper to the team's bitter rivals in Toronto riveted to their televisions. Back in the final for the first time in 80 years, Saturday's game will be the first league Stanley Cup contest played in Ontario since the Toronto Maple Leafs battled the Montreal Canadiens for the title 40 years ago. If the Senators are to turn the series around, Jason Spezza, Dany Heatley and Daniel Alfredsson -- the NHL's top scoring line -- will have to start putting the puck in the net. In two games the Senators have scored just twice, both goals coming on the powerplay. "It's not lack of effort, we're trying," said Spezza. "We know we have to be better. "We've got to win two games at home now. We put ourselves in a tough spot and we know our line's got to lead the way. "If people think this is over they're crazy."

Story published at magicvalley.com on Thursday, May 31, 2007 Last modified on Thursday, May 31, 2007 12:45 AM MDT Los Angeles Angels' Vladimir Guerrero watches the flight of his three-run home run in the fifth inning of an MLB baseball game against the Seattle Mariners in Anaheim, Calif., Wednesday, May 30, 2007. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) Guerrero's 3-Run Homer Lifts Angels 8-6 ANAHEIM, Calif. - It isn't often the Los Angeles Angels get home runs from their 3-4-5 hitters in the same game. They came at the right time, because Jered Weaver didn't have his best stuff. Vladimir Guerrero hit a go-ahead, three-run shot off Felix Hernandez, Gary Matthews Jr. and Casey Kotchman hit consecutive home runs in the first, and the Angels bullpen preserved an 8-6 win over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night. "It's good, because there are going to be sometimes when we're not going to do well offensively and our pitchers pick us up and keep us in close ballgames," Guerrero said through a translator. "We have a good pitching staff, and hopefully all of us can contribute to them." Guerrero's homer was his first since May 17 at Seattle. It hasn't been easy getting good pitches to hit, because everyone is pitching around the 2004 AL MVP. Guerrero's greatest strength is he is one of the game's best bad-ball hitters. "I can't get frustrated because it's part of the game. I've been saying that for a long time," Guerrero said. "I don't get frustrated because I trust the people that hit behind me. The home runs just happen when they happen. I don't worry about when they come or when they don't come. But I'm very happy that this one came tonight." Dustin Moseley (4-0) got the win in relief of Weaver, who was pulled after 4 2-3 innings with the Angels down 5-4. After Guerrero's homer put Los Angeles ahead 7-5, Moseley pitched two innings and gave up an RBI double to Raul Ibanez that cut the Angels' edge to 7-6 in the sixth. But Scot Shields pitched a perfect eighth and Francisco Rodriguez worked the ninth for his 18th save in 19 chances. Hernandez (3-3) allowed seven runs and nine hits in seven innings. He surrendered his first three homers of the season, as the Angels took the rubber game of the series and extended their lead in the AL West to 5 1/2 games over the second-place Mariners. "We were a little disappointed because we felt we had a chance to win the game with our ace on the mound," Adrian Beltre said. "It didn't happen, but we're going to get a chance to face these guys again, and hopefully we can do better next time. We've got four months left, so one series is not going to make a difference right now." Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak to 23 games _ tying his career best in 2001. The two-time AL batting champion is within one game of the franchise record set by Joey Cora in 1997. Weaver had won his previous three starts, and the Angels gave him a 4-1 lead in the first inning. But the Mariners made it 4-all on Beltre's RBI double in the fifth and Yuniesky Betancourt followed with an RBI single that finished the right-hander. "My command just really wasn't there," Weaver said. "The off-speed stuff felt great, but I was struggling with my fastball command. I just couldn't make my pitches and they put some good swings on the ball." Pinch-hitter Robb Quinlan drove in an insurance run in the Angels seventh with a sacrifice fly that Betancourt caught. The shortstop made an over-the-shoulder catch in short left-center field and couldn't get the ball home fast enough after Reggie Willits tagged up. Guerrero had a chance to break open the game in the eighth, but struck out with the bases loaded against Brandon Morrow. The rookie reliever extended his scoreless streak to 15 2-3 consecutive innings. The Mariners wrapped up a 6-4 road trip that began with a makeup game in Cleveland and continued through Tampa Bay, Kansas City and Anaheim. When they return to Seattle, the journey will have covered 6,273 miles. "It's going to be good to get back home," Beltre said. "We finished the road trip over .500 and we could have done better, but it was a good trip." Notes:@ Angels infielder Erick Aybar started at third base for the first time in his professional career. Normally a second baseman, he made a neat play on the first batter of the game, making a diving stop on Suzuki's grounder in the hole and throwing him out from one knee. ... Angels RHP Bartolo Colon's next scheduled start on Sunday was pushed back to June 8, when the club opens a nine-game road trip at St. Louis. The 2005 AL Cy Young winner, experiencing tightness in his triceps since early this month, has allowed 15 runs in 10 2-3 innings over his last two starts.

Johnny Damon led off the game with a home run and singled in the second for his 2,000th career hit. Robinson Cano hit three doubles and went 4-for-4. It was the second baseman's sixth-career four-hit game. Did you see that?: In the top of the ninth Alex Rodriguez appeared to yell out "I got it" during an infield pop up, causing the Jays infielder to drop what would have been the third out of the inning. "I just said, 'Hah!' That's it. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't." -- A-Rod Yankees 10, Blue Jays 5 end their five-game losing streak with his bat -- and his mouth. Rodriguez distracted Toronto third baseman by shouting at him on a key popup in the ninth inning, touching off arguments all over the field, and the Yankees beat the Blue Jays 10-5 Wednesday night. "I just said, 'Hah!' That's it," Rodriguez said. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't." It definitely worked in rankling the Blue Jays. "The thing about the Yankees, one of the reasons they're so respected, is they do things right. Always have," manager John Gibbons said. "They've got a lot of pride and a lot of class. They play the game hard. "That's not Yankee pride right there," he said. "That's not the way they play. I thought it was bush league." Rodriguez hit an RBI single with two outs in the ninth that made it 7-5. followed with a high infield pop and Rodriguez ran hard, cutting between Clark and shortstop Replays showed Rodriguez shouting something, and Clark backed off at the last second. McDonald was only a few steps behind Clark, but couldn't make the catch and ball dropped for an RBI single. "I don't know what my intention was," Rodriguez said. "I didn't say, 'I got it' or anything like that." Clark claimed Rodriguez called for the ball. "I heard a 'Mine' call and so I let it go," Clark said. "It wasn't Johnny Mac. What do you do? It makes you mad." After the play, McDonald started jawing with Rodriguez, and third base umpire Chad Fairchild got between them. Gibbons came out to argue, and exchanged words with Rodriguez and third base coach Larry Bowa before leaving the field as plate umpire Eric Cooper intervened. Rodriguez stayed on the bag with a smirk. stepped up to hit, he seemed to get into it with catcher and Cooper settled them down. Giambi followed with a two-run single. When the game ended, many of the Blue Jays stayed on the bench, staring at Rodriguez and the Yankees. Rodriguez brushed aside the Blue Jays' anger, saying the Yankees were "desperate" for a win. "Honestly, I couldn't care less," he said. "They have their opinions. We're looking not to be swept." Clark said he'd never seen -- or heard -- that play before. "This is my 16th season and it's never happened once," he said. Rodriguez said he's often heckled by opposing players. "That play happens to me three or four times a week, except it's not at third base, it's over in foul territory by the dugout," Rodriguez said. The Yankees didn't quite know what to think. "I wasn't sure that was allowed," outfielder said. "If it is, maybe we'll keep on doing it." Said manager Joe Torre: "I don't know what to feel for it. It's not like he said, 'I got it.'" It certainly was an adventuresome day for Rodriguez. He made the cover of the New York Post on Wednesday -- and not because of the Yankees' slump. "STRAY-ROD" blared the Page 1 headline across a picture of A-Rod and an unidentified woman in Toronto earlier this week. "Alex hits strip club with mystery blonde," it continued. "Absolutely no comment about anything personal and I certainly don't think this will be a distraction to our team," he said before Wednesday's win. Rodriguez has been in the middle of an unusual, on-field dispute before. In Game 6 of the 2004 AL championship series, he slapped the ball from Boston pitcher 's glove, and was called out for interference. Damon led off this game with a home run for the Yankees, who avoided falling nine games under .500 for the first time since they were 20-29 after play on June 20, 1995, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. hit three doubles and went 4-for-4 for the Yankees.

Payback for a couple years ago here in the French Open, or are you satisfied with coming back here? LLEYTON HEWITT: Yeah, I wasn't really looking at it that way, but yeah. Obviously he was too good a few years ago when I lost to him here. Yeah, it's good to get a win against him. Yeah, he's got to be one of the toughest second&#8209;round players to play. Plus at the moment you just don't know really what you're going to get from him, as well. So at first he played fantastically. I didn't feel like I played that poorly out there. I just had to try and find a way to change things around early in the third set. Q. Was the way you played the first two sets like the way he played the last time here? LLEYTON HEWITT: Yeah, a bit more, a bit. He was hitting his backhand great. His forehand is maybe slightly his weaker wing, but he doesn't miss too many balls on it either. He kept great depth. I felt like I had a lot of opportunities in the first set to get up a break, and I wasn't able to take them. He hit a lot of lines and big points, got a net cord. I felt like it was just a matter of trying to hang in there and take my chances when they come up. Q. Not to be too critical of him, but he's a guy that can toss a few matches and he doesn't exactly have the Lleyton Hewitt grit. Would it sort of hurt to lose to a guy like that when you're a tremendous competitor, and he's a guy that every now and then doesn't seem to really care about a match? LLEYTON HEWITT: Yeah, well, I don't know. It does make it harder playing a guy like that, because sometimes you just don't know what you're going to get. And mentally I had to be on my game the whole time. Yeah, he's going to have ups and downs and I knew that going into the match. And it was a matter of me not having those downs at any point. I had to keep, you know, concentrating the whole time, whether it's breakpoint or 15&#8209;Love in the game. You just don't know. He's such a great shot&#8209;maker, you don't know what he's going to come up with. In the first two sets, he played great. I felt like I got better as the match went on, though, which was good. Changed up things a little bit. And I felt once I, you know, got that fourth set under my belt, I felt pretty confident going into the fifth. Q. I saw only the first set, and he kept you behind the baseline four five meters. Did you manage to come near the baseline when you took over? LLEYTON HEWITT: Not really. Why'd you leave the match, huh (laughing)? Q. Second question (laughing). What has made you do so good results now on clay these last weeks? What has changed? What's up? LLEYTON HEWITT: In the past I've had some good results, I think, especially won some matches on clay. Hamburg, I played well there the whole week. I stepped it up. I knew I had to against the guys that I was up against. It was a pretty tough draw considering who I had to come up against, and the form that those guys had been in on clay. Yeah, I took a lot out of that week, I think, obviously coming so close to Nadal. Yeah, hold me in good stead, but tough match in the second round here today. So, yeah, it's nice to get through this one. Q. Is there any addition to your clay game now because of these results? LLEYTON HEWITT: Not really. I think just getting used to playing on it. I hit a lot of balls on the one clay court we have back in Australia before I came over to Rome and Hamburg, and worked on some things. I just felt like I wasn't that far away from playing well. I just had to get some matches under my belt, try to get that rhythm going again. You know, I felt like I played extremely well in Vegas earlier this year, then I got injured. It's just been that stop&#8209;start feeling. If you can get a lot of matches and wins under your belt, then it's sort of second nature. Q. In the first set there, one of the lineswomen got the call wrong and you replayed the point. It seemed to sort of irritate you enough, that's when you lost a little concentration and momentum. It looked like that sort of knocked you around a bit, and it took you a while to get back from that. Did that have a significant effect on you? LLEYTON HEWITT: Not so much. Yeah, the net, we replayed the point and you've got a dead net cord. So it was a couple of little bit unlucky plays in a row could have given me breakpoint to go 5&#8209;3 up and serve for the first set. Especially against a guy like, Gaston, who he's on edge the whole time out there. If that net cord went the wrong way and he hit a double fault, it could have been the end of the match, basically. It was a little bit frustrating, I guess, to not get those breaks when I needed to, because I felt if I got off to a good start I could have really put a lot of pressure on him and maybe run away with the match. In the end, he got confident, and I had to beat him at his best out there. Q. Clay is such a tough surface and you've had the injuries in the past. Right now you feeling pretty well on top of it? LLEYTON HEWITT: I feel pretty strong out there. Physically I felt like I outlasted him out there today. I think I'll be better for the run as well. So, yeah, I'd like to think that all the hard work I've done off the court, this is when you need it to pay off. So hopefully it will. Q. The decision in Australia to go to the (indiscernible) Cup, or whatever it's called, what are your thoughts on that? LLEYTON HEWITT: Yeah, I think it's a good decision from what I've heard. Yeah, the consistency of it, we can get a pace that's going to be consistent around Australia, you know, whether you're playing at a local club or playing Center Court at Rod Laver Arena. And that's been the biggest problem with Rebound Ace, whether I'm playing in Adelaide, Sydney or Melbourne, it plays differently. The weather conditions has always effected it so much. Yeah, so hopefully &#8209;&#8209; the other thing is player development and trying to get juniors to come up. If they're hitting balls around their ears when they're 5&#8209;, 6&#8209;, 7&#8209;year&#8209;olds, it's not the easiest surface to play on. Hopefully it pays off, I guess, for Australian development in the years to come. Q. Marat yesterday was talking about how difficult it is getting older, having those injuries, and how you carry on. Even as the competitor you are, have you had some tough times with that? LLEYTON HEWITT: Yeah, absolutely. I think anyone that, you know, gets injured. I haven't had, touch wood, any absolutely seriously injuries. It's more niggles that can be sometimes more frustrating. You feel like you're getting on a roll, and it sets you back three or four weeks. So I guess that's been frustrating, and it's a matter of not getting down on yourself there. You can't do anything about it. And that's sort of the way that I saw Miami. There wasn't a lot I could do about it. Get all the checks and get everything ready to go, and get back on your horse and start training again. That's where I felt like I was, you know, in the gym and on the practice court a lot of hours before coming over here to Europe. Yeah, it's nice that it's paying off a bit. Q. How did working with Andre sort of reenergize you, and what did you guys do? LLEYTON HEWITT: I actually don't know where that came from, because I didn't work with Andre. I did a bit of training with his trainer. Q. How'd that go? LLEYTON HEWITT: It was good. Very good. He's a very switched on guy. There's a lot of different training that he had me do which is a lot different than anything I've done in the past. I really enjoyed it. Q. How many days were you with him? LLEYTON HEWITT: I just did some weeks here and there when I was around the States. Q. You played a great match. But regardless of that, how much do you think did Gaston help you with his body language first. And second, if you notice the difference in his game in the first two sets and the other three? LLEYTON HEWITT: His body language is always the same. You know, he doesn't do fist pumps and yell out, "Come on." He doesn't show a lot of emotion; that's him. When I lost to him at the French Open a couple of years ago and he went on to win the tournament, he sort of took it all in his stride. That's him. He's very relaxed and laid back character, I think. As the match went on, I felt like my level lifted a little bit, which put pressure on him. I felt like he was doing a lot of running out there and stretching. And in the fifth set, there's no doubt that he wasn't quite getting to the balls that he was earlier in the match. Q. Is it fair to say that you're enjoying your tennis, perhaps enjoying your life a bit more now at the moment than you have done for a while? LLEYTON HEWITT: Not really, no. I guess there's times when you're frustrated, yeah. Indian Wells, Miami was frustrating this year. Leading into the Australian Open is frustrating. A small calf tear there. There's frustrating times. I enjoy putting in the hard work, and hopefully seeing it pay off. I really enjoy that. So I actually enjoyed when I was at home doing all the hard work, knowing that hopefully it's going to pay off in the next, whether it's two months or whether it's six months. I think it's starting to pay off now. I still think I can get better. Q. Your next opponent will be Jarkko Nieminen, and he played a very strong match today in three sets. What can you say about him ahead of that match? LLEYTON HEWITT: He's a good player. Played him a few times, and had the wood on him so far. We've had some tough matches. Obviously a left&#8209;hander. Good off both sides. He's got a good left&#8209;handed serve, not afraid to come in. Moves well. And yeah, it's a different kind of match&#8209;up, though, than playing a guy like Gaudio today, who is a typical clay court player. Nieminen's played well on hard court, grass, yeah, everything. It's going to be a tough match. Q. It's not the first time you've come back from two sets down, even in a Grand Slam. When you've lost the first two sets and you're sitting there in the break, what is going through your mind? What are you thinking about? How are you going to get back into it? LLEYTON HEWITT: Basically that, how I'm trying to work out small ways that I might be able to get back into it. Trying to get off to a good start in the third set, and not focusing on that you've got to win, go five sets to win now. I think that's one of the biggest keys is, you know, just focusing on what's just ahead of you. You know, throughout that whole third set, I was just trying to get that third set under my belt. I wasn't even thinking about the fourth or the fifth. It was the same in the fourth set, just thinking about that set. Got off to a good start, and I was able to hold serve throughout that set, which was good. Q. If you had grown up in Spain, do you think you'd be a French Open champion now and not a Wimbledon champion? LLEYTON HEWITT: Maybe. I don't know. That's a tough question. But, I'll still keep Wimbledon. Q. Do you find now that you're &#8209;&#8209; 26 or whatever, getting a bit older, happened to Andre, happens to a lot of players, do you feel people are more familiar with you and you get a few more fans? As you get older and people sort of feel more comfortable with you and they always cheer for some of the players who are more established and they're more familiar with? Do you feel that at all from the fans? LLEYTON HEWITT: Yeah, maybe sometimes. I felt like I had a quite a lot of support out there today, especially considering I was playing a guy that's won the title here a few years ago. So I actually felt like I had the crowd on my side. And I think they liked that I was putting in and giving 100%. I wasn't going to lie down out there, as well. I think the French crowds enjoy a tight match out there. I certainly gave them that. Q. We're seeing traditional producers of champions, countries like Australia and the USA, struggling to produce players to compete at tournaments like this. Britain obviously is still struggling to present anybody. Do you think it's hard for people growing up in those kind of countries to compete with the hunger of the people from more emerging nations these days? LLEYTON HEWITT: Yeah, in some ways, yeah. Obviously the States still &#8209;&#8209; yeah, they haven't had a great tournament here, but at all the three other majors, they're a dominant force with Roddick, and Blake, and Fish, and these guys up there. In terms of Australia, there is no doubt we're limited at the moment, I believe. And I know a lot of the guys, Fitzy and these guys, we need clay courts. It's a must, I think, to grow up on. I think you can learn a lot more. And it's a lot easier nowadays to switch from being a good clay court player to switch to hard court and grass than it is vice versa. I think you can learn a lot from growing up on clay &#8209; the art of how you play on it, the sliding, the drop shots, the angles. There's a lot of different things. You can't just go out there and blast your way with a big serve. Yeah, I think Australia has got to &#8209;&#8209; we are trying to do that. Which is a good thing. Q. It is obvious that you are coming back and reaching a level you should be because of your talent. How far do you think you are to be closer to Federer and Nadal? LLEYTON HEWITT: It's a tough question. They've obviously been the two dominant players over the last two and a half, three years now. Roger, especially on every surface, and Nadal's doing better and better on grass. Made the Wimbledon final, and he hasn't played there too many times. So yeah, it's hard to say how far away you are from actually reaching them, but obviously pushing Nadal. Yeah, Roger's been a standout the whole time. I still feel like there are errors in my game that I can work on to improve, and I'm going to keep trying. Can't find what you're looking for? Try Google Search!

A bill to toss out most rules against re-selling tickets is moving through the legislature, and could be signed by Governor Eliot Spitzer as early as tomorrow. Under the bill, average fans could scalp tickets on the Internet for whatever the market will bear. They could also sell at the venue, but not within certain distances. The change in attitude in New York and other states has been driven by the explosion in Internet ticket sales, and the realization of some sports and entertainment companies that they could profit as well. Russ Haven of the New York Public Interest Research Group worries that large-volume brokers will snap up available seats, then jack up prices. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson) NEW YORK - Barry Zito outpitched Tom Glavine over seven sharp innings and the San Francisco Giants beat the New York Mets 3-0 Wednesday night to snap a four-game losing streak. Pedro Feliz drove in three runs and Rich Aurilia tied a career high with four hits for the Giants, who bounced back from a difficult loss in the series opener against New York. The Mets won 5-4 in 12 innings Tuesday night when Armando Benitez balked in the tying run and surrendered a game-ending homer to Carlos Delgado. Paul Lo Duca had two hits for New York, which had won four straight. Glavine went seven innings but was denied in his second attempt at career win No. 296. Lo Duca led off the seventh with a double for his 1,000th career hit but Zito retired the next three batters, striking out pinch-hitter Julio Franco to end the inning. Zito (5-5) turned in his second consecutive strong outing after struggling in back-to-back starts earlier this month. He gave up 13 runs and 12 hits in 10 innings in outings at Colorado and Oakland, then allowed one run in seven innings in a win over Houston in his last start. He struck out a season-high seven against the Mets, holding them to six hits and one walk. Jack Taschner tossed a perfect eighth and Brad Hennessey got three outs for his second save. Barry Bonds returned to the lineup for the Giants, went 1-for-3 with a walk and remains 10 shy of breaking Hank Aaron's career record of 755 homers. He was booed lustily each time he came to the plate. Bonds entered with a .329 batting average and four homers in 100 career plate appearances against Glavine, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He hit a two-out single to center against him in the first inning to put runners on first and second. After Bengie Molina walked, Feliz grounded a two-run single into left field. Bonds bounced into a double play in the third before Molina singled to right to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. Feliz then tripled off the wall in right-center to make it 3-0. Glavine (5-3) intentionally walked Bonds in the fifth and got him to groundout to first to end the seventh on his 122nd and final pitch of the game. He allowed nine hits, walked two and struck out four. Mets reliever Guillermo Mota was activated after serving the 50th and final day of his suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance. He relieved Glavine to start the eighth and received a mixed reaction of boos and cheers from the home crowd. Notes:@ Giants SS Omar Vizquel made two slick, barehanded plays in the first four innings. ... The Mets optioned RHP Ambiorix Burgos to Triple-A New Orleans to make room for Mota on the roster.

Skip to next paragraph Magic officials went to Gainesville, Fla., to try to persuade Donovan to honor his commitment, but it appeared that a breakup was inevitable just three days after he decided to jump to the N.B.A. “While Central Florida, the Orlando Magic and Billy were energized with the announcement of his contract signing on Friday, we know there was a different feeling in Gainesville and people have been tugging at him since that time,” the Magic statement said. “Billy is conflicted with those emotions and the opportunity he has ahead in Orlando and in the NBA.” Florida’s athletic director, Jeremy Foley, declined to comment to The Orlando Sentinel on Monday morning at a University Athletic Association meeting. Foley flew to Richmond, Va., on Saturday to meet with Virginia Commonwealth Coach Anthony Grant about becoming Donovan’s successor. Grant, a former assistant coach under Donovan, was the leading candidate for the job and was expected to make a seamless transition. Many of Florida’s recruits said they would stick with their commitments to the program because Grant, who left Florida about a year ago, had helped recruit them there. But Grant released a statement Sunday night saying that he had not had any “in-person” contact with Florida. Foley never made it to meet him because he learned that Donovan was having second thoughts. first reported the story Sunday night. coach Stan Van Gundy is expected to be the Magic’s next choice if Donovan does back out of his contract; Van Gundy was the only other candidate the Magic had considered seriously. Donovan was close to signing on long-term deal worth more than $3 million a year with Florida before deciding to go to the Magic last week. He won a second consecutive national championship with the Gators in April. It remains unclear how easily the Magic will let Donovan back out of his contract. “We’ve had numerous conversations and a personal visit in Gainesville with Billy over the last 48 hours and we have a commitment from him that the dialogue between us will continue,” the Magic’s statement said.

Ben Spies — Mladin's teammate at Yoshimura Suzuki. Spies, of Texas, won the second race of the AMA Suzuki Superbike Doubleheader at the Elkhart Lake racetrack in the rain and regained the points lead. The defending series champion finished 11.794 seconds ahead of Jamie Hacking (Kawasaki). Mladin, who won Saturday's race — his seventh victory at Road America — was third. "I have to thank my team for doing such a great job, staying up until 1 in the morning to rebuild the bike I crashed in practice (Saturday)," said Spies, who won at RA for the first time in the Superbike series. "My Suzuki was so good in the rain today. I was afraid the track was going to dry out. We needed this win, for sure." Sunday's race, which began in a downpour, was red-flagged on lap two of 16 because of lighting. When it resumed, Spies quickly moved into the lead and led the rest of the way. Spies also won Sunday's AMA Superstock race. Other winners from the weekend were: Aaron Gobert (Honda) in the AMA Supersport Championship series and Joshua Hayes (Honda) in the AMA Formula Xtreme series.

Bench coach Allan Trammell will run the team in Piniella's absence. Piniella was suspended indefinitely on Sunday after umpiring crew chief Bruce Froemming alleged in his report that Piniella made contact with Wegner while kicking dirt on him during a dispute over a close play at third base. He missed Sunday's game, and Trammell managed the Cubs to a 10-1 victory over the Braves. After a Monday conversation with MLB Executive Vice President John McHale Jr., Piniella had the suspension reduced to four games. He will apparently miss the Milwaukee series and is expected back in the dugout for the opener of a series with the Braves in Atlanta beginning Thursday.

Benny Feilhaber scored his first goal for the national team and assisted on another Saturday night to help the Americans tune up for a busy summer of tournaments with a 4-1 exhibition victory over China. Feilhaber was among five U.S. starters who entered with five or fewer national team appearances. All made key contributions, with Feilhaber also assisting on Clint Dempsey's second-half goal. "Each and every game I play, I feel more confident and the players around me have felt more confidence with my game, so I've been able to get more balls and more touches," Feilhaber said. "That's the important thing about it. Every game, you get more balls, more touches, more confidence." Sacha Kljestan, making his national team debut, fed Feilhaber for a goal in the 28th minute that gave the United States a 2-1 lead. Michael Bradley, son of new U.S. coach Bob Bradley, set up DaMarcus Beasley's penalty-kick goal to open the scoring in the 10th minute, and defenders Jonathan Bornstein and Jonathan Spector made key contributions from the back line. "It's a good sign for the future," Dempsey said. "We have a lot of young kids coming up. They're very talented. All it's going to take is a little time for them to get adjusted and they'll be doing the same things we were doing. It will be more difficult to keep your spot. That's what you want, a more competitive environment." Landon Donovan and Eddie Johnson were among the stars playing in MLS this weekend, their last club games ahead of the upcoming CONCACAF Gold Cup. The United States opens the championship of North and Central America and the Caribbean on Thursday night against Guatemala. After that tournament, the U.S. team plays as an invited guest at the Copa America, South America's championship. "Obviously the Gold Cup is a huge tournament for us," Feilhaber said. "My goal is to play well in the Gold Cup and show well for the national team and earn a spot." Those will be the first real competitions for Bradley, who had the interim tag removed from his title last month. Bradley was hired in December to replace Bruce Arena and is now 4-0-1 as U.S. coach. "It felt the same as all the other games," Bradley said. Michael Bradley, making fifth national team appearance, set up Beasley early with a sharp pass down the middle. Beasley dribbled in the box and was tripped up by goalkeeper Chen Dong, who was given a yellow card. Beasley converted the penalty kick in the 10th minute, beating Chen with a shot down the middle. China answered when Dong Fangzhuo sent a pass into the box that Wang Peng deflected. Zhang Yaokun came up with the loose ball and beat goalkeeper Tim Howard, who enters the Gold Cup as the No. 1 American goalkeeper ahead of Kasey Keller. Feilhaber and Kljestan teamed up for the go-ahead goal midway through the first half. Kljestan passed to Feilhaber in the right side of the box. Feilhaber dribbled in and chipped the ball over the charging goalie, getting tripped up after the shot. Zhang Yaokun made a desperate attempt to save the ball but was unable to stop the ball from going in to give the U.S. a 2-1 lead. "I wouldn't have wanted to pass it to anybody else," Kljestan said. "When we came up in the 20s we were just two young kids trying to make it. It was our dream to play on the national team let alone play together. To have his goal scored on my assist is a great thing for us." Dempsey finally converted midway through the second half after having two good chances stopped by Chen. But the Chinese goalie could do nothing when Feilhaber's corner found Dempsey all alone for an easy header that made it 3-1. Oguchi Onyewu scored the final goal for the United States, heading in a cross from Beasley in the 79th minute. Keller was not tested at all in the second half as China struggled to generate much offense without regular captain Zheng Zhi, who He stayed in Asia to play for his club team Shandong in the East Asian Champions Cup. The Chinese play exhibitions against the Los Angeles Galaxy on Tuesday and the Colorado Rapids on June 10 as part of their tuneup for next month's Asian Cup. Notes: Charlie Davies and Kamani Hill entered as second-half subs in their first appearances with the U.S. national team. Hill is from nearby Berkeley. ...

Milwaukee battered Willis early, scoring once in the first on an RBI single by and again in the third on an RBI single by It could have been worse. The had four hits in the third, including a leadoff double by rookie grounded into a double play to end the inning. And in the fourth, with Fielder batting, was called out for running out of the baseline after a pickoff attempt. manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "It was just a bunch of ground balls that got through holes. He wasn't at his best, but he battled to pitch six strong innings." Hardy had an opposite-field homer in the eighth, his 16th, to make it 3-0. He said it is only his second home run to right field of the 30 in his major league career. "It still surprises me," he said. "I don't know how that happened," he said. Yost said Sheets had one of his best curveballs of the season but told him he was tiring quickly in the sixth inning, when he had thrown 99 pitches. Sheets said the conditions inside Miller Park - which Yost compared to a sauna - were a factor. Because of severe weather in the area, which included a tornado warning just north of Milwaukee County, the outfield stadium panels were closed in the third. Often that makes it hotter and more humid inside the stadium. "I was gassed," Sheets said. "I can probably count on one hand the times I have been gassed, and today was one of them." Still, Gonzalez was impressed. "I don't think I should ever be in the ballpark when he pitches, because I don't think I've ever seen him pitch badly," he said. As a third-base coach with Atlanta, Gonzalez watched Sheets strike out 18 in 2005. "When he pitches, I should take that day off." Willis entered the game 5-1 on the road this season. He has walked five batters three times in his career. The last time came May 9 in a 5-2 loss against the Los Angeles "We were able to make some adjustments within the innings to get some more ground balls," Willis said. "I didn't feel like I was losing any confidence, I just felt like if I could make a pitch, I could get out of it." And he almost did. "I know he has thrown the ball a lot better than that," Hardy said. "We came out there with a pretty good approach, and the fact that he wasn't at the top of his game helped."

"I'm very pleased with the effort," said Bradley, who until May 16 was the team's interim coach for five months. "We got a lot out of our effort." Bradley, who started five players with fewer than six international appearances, was particularly pleased with the performance of Benny Feilhaber, who had a goal and an assist in his third game with the national team. "Benny thus far has shown he can play the center of the field," Bradley said of the 22-year-old midfielder. "He showed his ability in seeing the right pass and in coming forward. It was a good game for Benny." "I felt pretty good in the middle today," he said. For much of Saturday's game, witnessed by a relatively placid 20,821 heavily pro-American spectators, the U.S. team was feeling much the same way. Although there were some letdowns, the Americans generally kept the Chinese team well out of harm's reach. "We did well to compete for 90 minutes," said defender Oguchi Onyewu, one of the team's greybeards with 19 international appearances. DaMarcus Beasley, the most experienced player among the starting 11 with 63 international appearances, got the Americans' first goal in the 10th minute. The speedy midfielder, easily the fastest man on the field, showed his heels to the Chinese defense after taking a long pass from Michael Bradley, the coach's son, just inside the half line and raced toward the goal with just keeper Chen Dong between him and the net. Chen came off the line in an attempt to cut down Beasley's angle, but the American midfielder had room to maneuver. So Chen did the most expedient thing -- he arm tackled Beasley near the top of the penalty area. Referee Hugo Guajardo quickly ran into the box, his hand pointing at the penalty spot. He then issued a yellow card to Chen. After Chen was booked, Beasley casually put the penalty kick beyond the reach of a sprawling Chen into the left side of the net for his 13th career goal with the national team. China got the goal back five minutes later when the American defense decided to watch something besides the ball. With the Chinese banging the ball around the penalty area and the U.S. team in some disarray, forward Wang Peng, situated between two American defenders who were facing the net, redirected a cross back out to an unmarked Zhang Yaokun. The defender took a couple of steps into the box and then unleashed a wicked 20-yard shot that eluded goalie Tim Howard. "We allowed China to push us into our end," Bob Bradley said, "and we didn't do a good job of getting the ball back into our end. But after they scored, we responded." And in the 28th minute midfielder Sacha Kljestan made his national team debut one to remember when he sent a pass over and through the Chinese defense to Feilhaber near the right corner of the penalty area. Feilhaber took several steps into the box before chipping the ball over the on-rushing Chen for a 2-1 U.S. lead. The Americans, who came into the game with just one loss in seven previous matches against the Chinese, secured their fifth victory over China in the 75th minute on a beautiful set piece. Feilhaber lofted a corner kick into the goalie area and Clint Dempsey ripped a header past a flat-footed Chen. Four minutes later, Onyewu got his second career goal, heading in Beasley's 30-yard free-kick from point-blank range.

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19034162/&cid Canucks re-sign forward Taylor Pyatt - Wire Services - Hockey - MSNBC.com Canucks re-sign forward Taylor Pyatt VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -The Vancouver Canucks re-signed forward Taylor Pyatt to a two-year, $3 million contract on Monday. The 25-year-old Pyatt set career highs with 23 goals and 37 points in 76 games while making $700,000 last season and could have become an unrestricted free agent on July 1. Acquired from Buffalo last summer for a fourth-round draft pick, Pyatt benefited from playing large parts of the season on the Canucks' top line with twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin. The 6-foot-4, 220-pound wing also scored two goals in the playoffs, including an overtime winner in the first round against Dallas, and added two assists in 12 postseason games. Pyatt, originally a first-round draft pick by the New York Islanders in 1999, has 65 goals, 135 points and 212 penalty minutes in 384 career NHL games. Â© 2007 The Associated Press.

Yankees vs. Chicago White Sox How do I find it? 06/04/2007 - 2:05 AM - Click reload often for latest version begins at: 7:05 PM ET The New York Yankees are recalling a pitcher from the minors to start Monday's series opener against the slumping Chicago White Sox at U.S. Cellular Field. However, instead of the one with 348 major league wins and seven Cy Young Awards, they'll start a pitcher with one career big league victory. Roger Clemens was scheduled to make his season debut for the Yankees (24-30) on Monday, but a fatigued right groin has caused him to be scratched for rookie Matt DeSalvo (1-2, 5.40 ERA). New York manager Joe Torre said the 44-year-old Clemens, who took a prorated share of a $28 million salary to try and lead the Yankees back into playoff contention, could pitch Saturday against Pittsburgh. ''We're tentatively looking at possibly next weekend,'' Torre said. ''The only thing I know is he's going to have an MRI (on Monday) and we'll have more information.'' On Sunday, New York defeated Boston 6-5 after Alex Rodriguez's major league-leading 20th home run in the top of the ninth broke a 5-all tie. The victory was the Yankees' third in four games following a five-game losing skid, but they are still 12 1/2 games behind the first-place Red Sox in the AL East. ''It's important what we do after this,'' Rodriguez said. ''We were in a situation where we needed to win this series against a good team. (Now) we've got to back it up.'' The Yankees were hoping to get a boost with Clemens on the mound, but DeSalvo - he of four career starts - will open this four-game series. The right-handed DeSalvo was sent back down to the minors after giving up three runs and five hits in 4 2-3 innings of a 7-2 loss to Toronto last Monday. He was saddled with his first major league loss against the White Sox (25-27) at U.S. Cellular Field on May 17, giving up four runs and six hits in just 3 1-3 innings of a 4-1 defeat. Chicago won two of three games over New York in mid-May, but has been struggling lately. The White Sox lost to Toronto 4-3 on Sunday to cap a 1-6 road trip, and have dropped 10 of their last 15 games overall. ''I wanted (Clemens) to pitch,'' Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen, who was ejected on Sunday, told the team's official Web Site. ''At least people (would) forget how bad we are playing, at least for a day.'' The White Sox have scored just nine runs in their last four games, as first baseman Paul Konerko and right fielder Jermaine Dye are each hitless in their last three. Jon Garland (3-3, 3.91) hopes to put a rough first two months of the season behind him when he takes the hill. Garland has won 18 games each of the last two seasons, but the White Sox are just 3-7 when he's pitched this year. One of Garland's better starts this season, though, came against DeSalvo and the Yankees last month. He gave up one run and six hits in seven innings to earn the win. Since beating New York, the right-hander has allowed 10 runs in 12 1-3 inning over his last two starts. He is also coming off his worst outing of the season. After being spotted with a five-run lead on Wednesday, Garland gave up season highs of six runs and five walks in six innings of a 7-6 loss to Minnesota, although he did not get charged with the decision. Garland is 2-5 with a 3.42 ERA in seven career starts against the Yankees. Rodriguez went 2-for-11 against the White Sox earlier this season, but both of those hits came off Garland. The Yankees third baseman is batting .429 (12-for-28) with two homers and a double versus Garland lifetime.

http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/n/a/2007/06/03/sports/s152107D94.DTL&cid Kanaan Wins IRL Race at Milwaukee Mile Kanaan Wins IRL Race at Milwaukee Mile By MIKE HARRIS, AP Auto Racing Writer Sunday, June 3, 2007 (06-03) 19:39 PDT WEST ALLIS, Wis. (AP) -- This time, Helio Castroneves thought he had it made on the Milwaukee Mile. He was out front and pulling away on the track that has disappointed him time and again throughout his IndyCar career. Then, without warning and just 25 laps from the finish of Sunday's race, the rear wing on his Team Penske Dallara collapsed, sending Castroneves into the wall and giving Tony Kanaan his second straight Milwaukee win. "I had the race won," said Castroneves, who led four times for a race-high 126 laps. "It's a shame that something so odd happened there at the end." That gave the lead to Kanaan, his fellow Brazilian and longtime friend, who stayed out front the rest of the way to record the ninth win of his IndyCar career, and perhaps the most unexpected one. Castroneves was so far ahead when he crashed that Kanaan didn't even see what caused the spinout. "I didn't even know they had a wing problem until I made it to Victory Lane," Kanaan said. "I only saw Helio spinning and crash." Sam Hornish Jr., the reigning IndyCar Series champion and Castroneves' teammate, also had a problem with his rear wing. Hornish, who finished ninth, had to pit while running second just six laps from the end because the wing was also coming loose. Tim Cindric, president of Team Penske, was at a loss to explain what happened to his two cars, but he felt particularly bad for Castroneves. "Helio has always had good starts here, but something always seems to happen to him," Cindric said. "There was no reason for that to happen. It was a big disappointment. "This place hasn't been good to him, but it certainly wasn't his fault today." Once Kanaan got the late lead, he drove away from the field. Andretti Green Racing teammate Dario Franchitti, coming off a victory last week in the Indianapolis 500, finished second, 2.57 seconds &#8212; a full straightaway &#8212; behind Kanaan. "Sometimes it's not always the best car that wins the race," said Kanaan, shrugging. "We could say that many times. I just hung (in) there all day. It was a difficult race." Kanaan lost ground just before halfway, falling from the lead to 10th when he had to make an extra pit stop because he was running out of fuel when the pits were closed under caution. IRL officials allowed him to pit for a splash of fuel, but made him wait until the pits were officially open to come back in for more fuel and tires. "We had a couple of misfortunes. I didn't hit my marks (in the pits) and I made my guys waste precious time, but when I make mistakes, they make up for them," the winner said. "When they make mistakes, I make up for them. That's what makes this team so strong. "I definitely had to race this race, apart from the last five laps. Before that I had to be on the charge." Dan Wheldon wound up third, followed by Scott Dixon, Vitor Meira, Scott Sharp, Ed Carpenter and Danica Patrick, the last driver on the lead lap. Patrick, still trying for her first IndyCar victory, bumped wheels with Wheldon on lap 88 as she attempted to pass both the Englishman and Franchitti for fourth place. She slid into the infield grass before saving the car and continuing, but lost a lap when she had to have a suspension piece repaired by her crew. Patrick eventually regained that lost lap, thanks to pit strategy, but was furious with Wheldon after the race. The two had a brief one-sided discussion in the pits, with Patrick putting her arm around Wheldon as she talked with him and then giving him a half-shove as the Englishman walked away. "I definitely feel that was worth some sort of penalty," Patrick said. Wheldon didn't agree with Patrick's assessment of the incident. "I think she thought she was alongside me," he said. "Unfortunately for her, she wasn't." Talking about the postrace confrontation, he noted, "She's messing with the wrong person if she wants to get feisty. I'm a lot tougher than she is on track." Buddy Rice, the 2004 Indy 500 winner, stayed on track when the other leaders pitted for the first time and led 37 laps before he had to make his first stop. That cost Rice a lap and he never got close to the lead again, crashing on lap 159. Marco Andretti, who had a spectacular crash near the end of the Indy 500, also hit the wall late in Sunday's race.

It was Truex's first Nextel Cup victory. DOVER, Del. - Martin Truex Jr. earned his first career victory for Dale Earnhardt Inc., winning at Dover International Speedway on Monday hours after the death of longtime NASCAR chairman Bill France Jr. Truex won for the first time in 58 career points races on what the New Jersey native has long considered his hometown track. He ended a dominant five-race winning streak for Hendrick Motorsports, leading 216 of the 400 laps on the Monster Mile in NASCARâ€™s Car of Tomorrow. Truex showed DEI just might be in good hands once coveted free-agent Dale Earnhardt Jr. leaves at seasonâ€™s end. Now, for a few days at least, Truex can talk about his win instead of the latest Earnhardt rumors. â€œIn times of change, and times when people donâ€™t really know whatâ€™s going on and they need some direction, I am just happy to be the one in Victory Lane,â€ Truex said. â€œCouldnâ€™t have come at a better race track. Just unbelievable, man.â€ But news of Franceâ€™s death overshadowed the race. The flag at Victory Lane was lowered to half staff shortly after the announcement, and drivers paid tribute to the man who transformed NASCAR. Truex even was reminded over the radio by his crew to remember and honor France after the race. Certainly the dayâ€™s wait for the Autism 400 was worth it for Truex, now closing in on being one of the top 12 drivers for the Chase. Heâ€™s eight points behind Mark Martin, whoâ€™s 12th. The blowers were still out while the cars were out on the grid waiting for their pace laps. But the sun peeked out right as the green flag dropped, which led to a clear and clean day of racing. Pole sitter Ryan Newman, who led most of the first half of the race, was denied his first win since 2005 and finished second. Carl Edwards, who won the Busch Series race here on Saturday was third. â€œHe definitely likes this racetrack, and thatâ€™s unfortunate for me,â€ Newman said. â€œJust to be up front all day and lead a lot of laps is a great feeling, even on a Monday.â€ Denny Hamlin and Matt Kenseth rounded out the top five. Hendrick Motorsports had won five straight races and nine of the past 10 Nextel Cup races, but only points lead Jeff Gordon (9th) finished in the top 10 at Dover. Casey Mears was 13th; Jimmie Johnson was 15th and Kyle Busch 17th. Gordon has a 152-point lead over Johnson in the points standings. Slide show: Week in Sports Pictures Week in Sports Pictures King James dunks, Duke suffers defeat and royal celebrations erupt this week. Mears won the Coca-Cola 600 last week, giving Nextel Cup two first-time winners in consecutive races. It was the first time the series had consecutive first-time winners since Tony Stewart and Joe Nemechek in 1999. Truex had not seen his success on the Busch Series circuit â€” consecutive championships in 2004 and 2005 before joining DEIâ€™s Cup team â€” carry over into Cup. But he gained momentum two weeks ago when he won the Nextel Open at Charlotte and earned a spot in the in NASCARâ€™s All-Star race. Earnhardt hoped to turn a second-place qualifying effort into his first win of the season but instead was plagued by tire woes, dropped four laps back at one point and finished 22nd. Earnhardt congratulated Truex in Victory Lane, telling his teammate that he knew he could win. â€œHeâ€™s been a great friend, and Iâ€™ll see him at the house tonight,â€ Truex said. â€œWeâ€™re going to have some fun.â€ ALSO ON THIS STORY Longtime NASCAR chief France Jr. dies Discuss: Sound off on motor sports message boards Â© 2007 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/M. Spencer Green) NFL Suspends Tank Johnson for 8 Games NEW YORK - Tank Johnson of the Chicago Bears was suspended by the NFL for the first eight games of the 2007 regular season for violating the league's new personal conduct policy. The defensive tackle recently served a two-month jail stint on a probation violation on gun-related charges. He's the third player suspended by commissioner Roger Goodell in little more than a month for off-field behavior. In April, Goodell suspended Tennessee Titans defensive back Adam "Pacman" Jones for the entire 2007 season and Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry for eight games. Jones is appealing his suspension. Goodell said Johnson's suspension could be reduced to six games if he has no further involvement with law enforcement and undergoes counseling. After meeting with Goodell last month upon his release, Johnson said he was ready to accept whatever punishment Goodell handed down and that he wants to become the NFL's "Man of the Year," the player honored for being its best citizen.

(AP) -With one powerful swing, Vladimir Guerrero gave the Los Angeles Angels another pulsating victory. Guerrero hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth off Chris Ray, and the Angels beat the Baltimore Orioles 4-3 on Sunday after being held to one hit through the first seven innings by Jeremy Guthrie. ''It feels very good, especially knowing what our guys did on the mound, to be able to pick them up,'' Guerrero said through a translator. ''The hits were hard to come by today. Some solid contact, but their guy also did a good job. Definitely, it's a huge win for us.'' Chone Figgins greeted Ray (3-4) with a leadoff single in the ninth, and the right-hander went to a 1-1 count on Guerrero before the 2004 AL MVP drove a hanging slider to left-center for his 350th career homer and 12th this season. ''Something in my heart told me that Vladdy was going to hit a homer,'' Angels starter Ervin Santana said. ''He waited for his pitch and he hit it good.'' The blown save was Ray's fourth in 16 chances. ''Every loss is tough, especially when you lose in the ninth inning,'' Ray said. ''I don't feel good about it. Jeremy pitched a great game and he deserved to win it. It didn't come out that way, so obviously it's tough for him to have thrown that great and not get a decision out of it.'' Guthrie allowed two runs - one earned - and three hits over eight innings, struck out four and did not walk a batter in his seventh start of the season. The right-hander, moved into the rotation full-time on May 8 when Jaret Wright went on the disabled list, has a 1.68 ERA in the starting role. ''You work for consistency,'' Guthrie said. ''It's always a pleasant surprise anytime you're pitching at this level to have that kind of consistency, so I'm very grateful. Every time I go out, and almost every inning that I get through, I feel a lot of gratitude because these guys are good hitters and anything can happen on any pitch. So to string together a bunch of good innings like that is humbling.'' Chris Bootcheck (1-0) pitched a perfect ninth for his first major league win. Jose Molina's one-out single in the third was the only hit for the AL West-leading Angels until Shea Hillenbrand singled with one out in the eighth and pinch-hitter Casey Kotchman followed with a double. Hillenbrand scored on Howie Kendrick's groundout, trimming Baltimore's lead to 3-2. Santana gave up three runs and seven hits over seven innings, striking out eight and walking one. Left fielder Garret Anderson played his first game since April 27 after missing the previous 34 because of a sore hip flexor on his right side. The Angels were 23-11 in his absence. Melvin Mora gave the Orioles a 2-1 lead in the fourth, driving a 3-2 pitch to left-center for his seventh homer of the season and the eighth allowed by Santana in five career starts against Baltimore. ''It was a slider and I know I was stupid with that pitch because I knew he was waiting for that and I just threw it anyway,'' Santana said. ''It was 3-2 and I didn't want to walk him.'' The Orioles made it 3-1 in the sixth when Miguel Tejada led off with a single, advanced to third on a pair of deep fly balls and scored on Jay Payton's single. Before that inning, Tejada was 1-for-14 lifetime against Santana, while Payton was 3-for-22. Brian Roberts singled with two outs in the Orioles' third and scored on a double by Nick Markakis. The Angels tied it in the bottom half on a grounder to second by Reggie Willits that drove in Molina. Roberts, whose error allowed Kendrick to reach safely, fielded Willits' ball about 5 feet from the bag and could have turned an inning-ending double play himself. But he wasted time flipping the ball to Tejada for the force on Kendrick, who upended the shortstop with a hard takeout slide. Notes: This was only the second time this season that the Orioles' pitching staff, which leads the AL with 232 walks, did not issue one. The other time was May 8, when Guthrie beat Tampa Bay 8-3 at Baltimore. ... Mora had no home runs in 39 at-bats against the Angels last season. ... Kendrick was 0-for-3 and has only five hits in 40 at-bats since coming off the disabled list May 22. ... Molina, who turned 32 on Sunday, started behind the plate for the first time since May 26.

Sam Smith on pro basketball Get your Bulls on View from the Fans CS.com blog: What's Goin' On Jordan racers finish in Superbike top 10 June 3, 2007, 9:01 PM CDT ELKHART LAKE, Wis. -- Hard to believe that Michael Jordan essentially represents the little-1000cc-engine-that-could. But such is life for his Jordan Suzuki motorcycle racing team, and its $2 million budget, as it competes against factory teams that can dig into pockets as deep as $20 million. Still, in this year's AMA Superbike Championship series&#8212;the premier race of the four different cycle classifications&#8212;Jordan's team had two riders in the top 15 of the points standings entering the Sunday Superbike race at the rain-slicked Road America track. And then both Aaron Yates and Jake Holden posted top-10 finishes in that main event. "We're the top underdog," general manager Ken Abbott joked. Yates finished fourth in the Superbike race, briefly taking the lead after a rain delay and inciting some rejoicing in Jordan's suite. Yates hit a paint stripe in the fifth lap and slipped back, but it was still a good showing for a racer who was No. 8 going in. Holden, 14th in the standings entering the Superbike race, finished seventh in Sunday's event. Holden then finished sixth and Yates eighth in a Superstock Series race later Sunday. The team's next races take place June 22-24 at Miller Motorsports Park in Tooele, Utah. 4-game suspension for Piniella Judge: Split mega-rich couple's assets 50-50 More suspects charged in fatal bank heist Barbara Rose: Group helps mom with job re-entry Sell a home on forsalebyowner.com Sam Smith: Cavs' ascension still a stunner Woman arrested in beating death of Howard Porter Kerr confirms that he'll be GM of Suns At last, Cleveland gets over the hump Chicago Bulls gear at the ChicagoSports.com Team Fan Shop.

CS.com blog: What's Goin' On Patrick rips fellow driver She has words with Wheldon, blames him for spinout WEST ALLIS, Wis. -- The race ended and she clambered from her car and immediately made her way to Dan Wheldon. When she reached him she grabbed his left forearm, which riveted his attention, and with unabated emotion got into his face. Some 80 minutes earlier and deep into the ABC Supply/A.J. Foyt Indy 225, Danica Patrick had also been aflame and the center of attention as she charged to sixth place after starting 17th. "I thought I had a car to win," she said of the race eventually taken by her Andretti Green teammate Tony Kanaan on Sunday at the Milwaukee Mile. But her assertion certainly seemed true in Turn 1 of Lap 87, where she made a run at Target Chip Ganassi's Wheldon and teammate Dario Franchitti, who were sitting fourth and fifth. She was rushing between the two, but suddenly her right front tire brushed Wheldon's left rear, and just like that she was spinning and in danger of crashing. She saved her car, but a damaged steering rod forced her to pit and cost her a lap, eventually dooming her to an eighth-place finish. "I think she had a run on Dario and I think she thought she was alongside me," Wheldon said. "Unfortunately for her, she wasn't. ... I've been in this business long enough to know when someone is there and when somebody is not. Maybe it's a bit of inexperience there on her part." "Something happened ... and Dario and Dan got slowed up," Patrick countered. "I went down on the inside and got a really good run on them, I passed Dario, pulled all the way up alongside Dan, drove down into the corner, all the way up alongside of him ... and Dan just turned down into the corner." That's why she was fuming after the race, and she cared little that her emotions were on full display. She cared only that Wheldon knew, which prompted the confrontation. "I said, 'What happened? What was that for? Did you not see me? Why didn't you back off?' " she said of their conversation, which she ended by flinging away Wheldon's arm. "He didn't say anything. I said, 'I was clearly inside of you' because I heard him say in an interview that I wasn't all the way up alongside of him. I'm not sure what is lost in translation there, but I was completely alongside of him. ... Then he said, 'Well, you can't get caught up in the marbles.' I said, 'Well, that's a pass, Dan. You need to let off.' He didn't. He turned into me. I told him, 'If you don't think I'm going to remember this, you're crazy.' " "I'm sure she's feeling the pressure of not winning races," Wheldon said. "In a situation like that, you sometimes get desperate. ... She's just feisty. ... She's just being Danica. She'll be fine when she calms down. But she's messing with the wrong person if she wants to get feisty. I'm a lot tougher than she is on the track." After the incident, it looked as if the race belonged to Team Penske's Helio Castroneves, who led by more than three seconds with 25 laps remaining. But then, coming out of Turn 4, his rear wing collapsed and he spun into a wall and fell all the way to 16th place. That gave the lead to Kanaan, who was being challenged by Penske's Sam Hornish Jr., but then Hornish, too, had trouble with his rear wing, which dropped him to ninth. That gift-wrapped the race for Kanaan, but afterward all eyes were still on Patrick. 4-game suspension for Piniella Judge: Split mega-rich couple's assets 50-50 More suspects charged in fatal bank heist Barbara Rose: Group helps mom with job re-entry Sell a home on forsalebyowner.com A makeover makes sense Spark in park as skid ends Donovan may want to return to Gators Aloha: Victorino's homer a fitting finish Wildcats quickly seal their fate Copyright & terms of service

On Friday, Mr. Donovan signed a five-year, $27.5 million deal to coach Orlando, leaving behind the Florida Gators team he'd led to the last two national titles and had committed to coaching again next season. Over the weekend, according to several reports, he had second thoughts -- faster than you can say Nick Saban. After Mr. Donovan got an ovation from Magic staffers on Friday, in the Tampa Tribune, "Clearly, this will be a long honeymoon." of the Florida Times-Union, after watching the Magic press conference, "The honeymoon had commenced."

The coach and the NBA team are lovebirds no more, but the Magic may still try to keep their man. If he does return to the college ranks, it appears Gators fans would welcome him back. Birmingham News columnist Kevin Scarbinsky can't figure out why the aforementioned Mr. Saban got so much grief for leaving the Miami Dolphins to coach Alabama, yet Mr. Donovan gets a free pass in Gainesville -- despite signing a recruit, hiring an assistant and representing Florida in the final weeks before his departure. Orlando Sentinel columnist Mike Bianchi says Mr. Donovan is making the right decision, albeit a bit late. "He still has a chance to go down as the greatest college basketball coach of the modern era if he gets out of his Magic deal and goes back to Gainesville," . "Otherwise, he'll just be another NBA coach with a mediocre team." But the Sentinel's David Whitley says Mr. Donovan shouldn't duck out on the NBA. "He said he wants to grow as a coach," . "Designing a defense for LeBron James presents more of a professional challenge than beating Mississippi State. Though I'm sure Donovan would miss that annual mid-winter trip to Starkville." Speaking of LeBron: Seven months ago, before the San Antonio Spurs' home opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers, San Antonio Express-News columnist Buck Harvey wondered what would happen if Mr. James and the Cavs returned for the Spurs' final home game of the season. That may well happen as the Spurs take home-court advantage into the finals against the Cavs, winners of four straight to defeat the Detroit Pistons in the East finals. Mr. Harvey is dutifully humble about his lucky guess: "This is called a stretch. It happens on deadline." That said, some of proved prescient: "It would be the young, commercialized star vs. the old, anti-hype one, and now there's a promotional poster ready for production. It would show LeBron dunking on Tim Duncan." (The photo would come from that regular-season home opener.) After an up-and-down season that looked lost around the All-Star Break, James is getting more love than ever before. Columnists point to his reaction after Cleveland eliminated the Pistons at home on Saturday as evidence of his selflessness. "With praise and exultation raining down from the rafters, James' first act was to leap into the arms of Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the hulking Cleveland center, and embrace him for a long, long time," in the San Francisco Chronicle. "At a time when he officially had become the centerpiece of the NBA, James' reaction wasn't to stand in the middle of the court, roaring, arms upraised. He found the guy whose heart had been broken, back in February, when his wife delivered stillborn twins, a boy and a girl. Ilgauskas had to leave the team for a while, and the pain has not fully healed." That team-first attitude may help explain how Mr. James lifted a mediocre supporting cast to the finals at age 22. (A mediocre Eastern Conference didn't hurt.) It took Michael Jordan seven seasons and Scottie Pippen, while Kobe Bryant had Shaquille O'Neal. That Kobe comparison is especially poignant after last week's wild events when the Lakers star asked for a trade, then rescinded the request. "You don't have to resort to demands for trades or trying to be the general manager in your spare time," Paul Oberjuerge tells Kobe in the Los Angeles Daily News. "If you play hard enough, smart enough, relentlessly enough, great things can happen." Because of the understandable fear that the best moment of the Cavs' season has already happened -- the superior Spurs will be favored -- columnists are already taking note of Cleveland's celebrations, and its sad sports plight: no championships since the 1964 Browns. "The city could use the good cheer more than most municipalities," in the Washington Times. "And it can find a modicum of encouragement in the travails of the Cavaliers." Detroit could use its own good cheer, but instead the Pistons join the Red Wings as teams to fall one round short of the finals. Detroit Free Press columnist Mitch Albom was troubled by the defeated players' sense of entitlement and superiority even after defeat: "It keeps the Pistons from being coached. It keeps them from embracing a sense of urgency. Most importantly, it keeps them in denial for the future." What's eating Chris Pronger? For the second time in six games, the 6'6" Anaheim Ducks defenseman has dealt a blow to the head of an opposing player and left him motionless on the ice. This time, Mr. Pronger is being suspended for tonight's Game 4, giving a notable advantage to the Ottawa Senators, down 2-1 in the Stanley Cup finals. The hit on Ottawa center Dean McAmmond resulted in Mr. Pronger's , and just the third suspension in finals history. SI.com's Michael Farber says this was "the perfect suspension storm," with several factors -- in addition to justice -- combining to ensure Mr. Pronger would miss tonight's game. "Game 3 was the first of the finals that was televised on NBC," . "And seeing a glassy-eyed McAmmond prostrate on the ice for a few minutes is hardly the image the NHL wants to show to its audience in the United States." Columnists come down hard on the offending defenseman. "Pronger earned the wrath of the NHL and jeopardized the Ducks' chances of winning the Cup," in the Los Angeles Times. She adds, "That blow also cemented Pronger's reputation as a cheap-shot artist, a shameful choice for someone who has the talent to be so much better." The Toronto Star's Damien Cox says the Ducks' rough play could be their undoing. "If the Ducks don't win the Stanley Cup it won't be because they weren't good enough," . "It will be because they threw it all away to prove they're the meanest SOBs on the block." CBC commentator Don Cherry may have something to say about the proper role of hard hits in hockey when he joins tonight's broadcast on NBC between periods.

The Dana Altman Award After briefly agreeing to coach the Orlando Magic, Billy Donovan has returned to Gainesville to continue his tenure as coach of the Gators. Sometimes switching schools is like partaking in multiple drinking games in one night -- it seems like a good idea at the time, but reality quickly hits. recently returned to Creighton one day after deciding Arkansas wasn't the job for him, and made a quick two-day turnaround to come back to Winthrop last year when he realized Charleston wasn't as good of a job as he had (he was introduced as Wichita State's new coach a few months ago when left for Texas A&M). , fresh off signing a $27.5 million contract with the Orlando Magic, might not even give himself a chance to compile a losing record in the NBA like his mentor . Donovan has had second thoughts about taking the job and has expressed interest in returning to Gainesville. Location couldn't have been a reason that Donovan wanted to return to Florida, because Orlando is only a couple of hours from Gainesville. Maybe the idea of a 40-year coaching career of proportions was important to Billy, or maybe it's just that he changed his mind after hearing a certain young man's that college coaches tend to disappoint in the pros.

Team of the Week is officially over. Last weekend, the men's golf team won their first team title since 1994, the year before Woods enrolled at Stanford as a freshman. The team shot an 11-under 1,109, and was the only squad to remain under par. The title was the 95th in school history, good for second all-time in NCAA history.

Abbott threw a no-hitter in the opening game of the Women's College World Series and struck out 16 in a 2-0 win over Texas A&M, fanned 16 against Arizona in a 1-0 win, and struck out 17 in a 3-0 win over Northwestern to help her team advance to the Championship series.

Giants 8, Phillies 1 PHILADELPHIA (AP) -Barry Zito allowed only an unearned run over six innings and Ryan Klesko hit a three-run homer to lead the San Francisco Giants over the Philadelphia Phillies 8-1 Monday. Zito (6-5) pitched out of trouble throughout the afternoon to win his third straight start. Barry Bonds was 0-for-4 with two strikeouts and a walk to remain at 746 career homers, 10 shy of breaking Hank Aaron's record. After homering 11 times in his first 76 at-bats, the Giants slugger has only one home run in 61 at-bats since connecting May 8. Ray Durham hit a two-run shot and Randy Winn, Bengie Molina and Kevin Frandsen each had three hits for the Giants, who have won just three of their last 10 games. Zito allowed six hits, walked four and struck out five. The left-hander has an 0.45 ERA in his last three outings after giving up 13 runs combined in consecutive starts. Jon Lieber (2-4) allowed five runs and 10 hits in five-plus innings. He's allowed 14 runs and 29 hits in three starts after posting a 2.50 ERA in his first six. The Phillies had plenty of chances against Zito, but couldn't get a clutch hit. They were 1-for-14 with runners in scoring position and stranded 12 runners. Philadelphia lost five of seven on its homestand after sweeping a three-game series in Atlanta to move a season-best two games over .500. The Phillies are eight games behind the NL East-leading Mets going into a three-game series in New York. The Giants scored five runs off Lieber with two outs in the fifth to take a 5-0 lead. Frandsen led off the inning with a single and Winn had an infield single that put runners at the corners with one out. Fred Lewis followed with a grounder to first baseman Ryan Howard, who was a few feet off the bag. Instead of going to second and trying for an inning-ending double play, Howard hesitated before throwing home to get Frandsen. Klesko hit the next pitch off a billboard on the facing of the second deck in right field to give the Giants a 3-0 lead. A high follow-through on his swing made Klesko's bat flip look exaggerated as he admired his second homer of the season. The Phillies didn't appear to be offended. Bonds followed with a walk, Durham doubled and Molina was intentionally walked to load the bases. Pedro Feliz drove in a run with a single to right and Frandsen's infield single to third made it 5-0. The Phillies had a chance for a big inning in the bottom of the fifth, but only produced a run. Singles by Jimmy Rollins and Chase Utley sandwiched around second baseman Durham's error on Shane Victorino's grounder loaded the bases. But Howard flied out to shallow left. After Rollins scored on Jayson Werth's groundout to cut it to 5-1, Aaron Rowand fouled out to end the inning. With the bases loaded and one out in the first, Werth popped out to shallow right and Rowand hit a bouncer to Zito to end the inning. After the first two batters reached in the third, Utley struck out looking, Howard fanned swinging and Werth flied out. The Phillies again put runners on first and second with no outs in the sixth, but pinch-hitter Pat Burrell, Rollins and Victorino all grounded out. Notes: Giants RHP Russ Ortiz pitched two-thirds of an inning, before leaving with an apparent injury in the eighth. ... The Phillies are 6-15 against left-handed starters. ... Klesko is batting .405 (17-for-42) with five homers and 18 RBIs lifetime against Lieber. ... Zito is 89-4 when he receives four runs or more.

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced Monday Bears defensive tackle will be suspended eight games as part of the league's new conduct policy. Goodell did give Johnson the chance to reduce the suspension to six games if he meets certain conditions. The league notified Johnson he could reduce the suspension by two games if he has no further adverse involvement with the law, complies with all the league requirements and doesn't participate in any practices or organized team workouts during the suspenson. Johnson will be allowed to be at the Bears facility during the suspension for counselling sessions and other approved activities, including physical treatment or individual workout sessions. Johnson could review the matter no later than Oct. 1 to determine if the suspension can be reduced to six games.Johnson's suspension is not as severe as of the Titans, who is expected to miss the entire season despite not having any previous convictions. It's the same length as Bengals wide receiver , who had a few incidents that led to convictions. Johnson served 60 days in jail for violating probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor weapons charge. In 2005, Johnson was arrested for possession of a handgun. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation and 40 hours of community service. In February of 2006, he was charged with aggrevated assault and resisting arrest after becoming engaged in a verbal dispute with a police officer. Charges were eventually dropped. In December, Lake County police searched Johnson's home and allegedly discovered six firearms. He was charged with violation of probation and possession of unlicensed firearms. The 6-3, 300-pound Johnson has played three seasons with the Bears and is an important part of the defensive line. He's more of the run-stopper next to , whose quickness allows him to shoot the gap and disrupt plays in the backfield. Johnson is eligible to participate in the team's offseason workout program and will be allowed to partcipate in preseason games. Senior writer John Clayton covers the NFL for ESPN.com.

After signing a contract with the Magic on Friday, Donovan, who is fresh off leading the Florida Gators to back-to-back national titles, has decided he wants out of Orlando, multiple sources told ESPN.com. ESPN.com has learned that Donovan was waiting Monday afternoon to hear from Magic owner Rich DeVos to find out what Orlando will do with him. The choices are simple: either the two parties will agree to rescind his deal or the Magic could pressure him into honoring the contract and/or seek damages. Donovan was at his home in Gainesville, Fla., Monday, waiting for the Magic's response, and isn't expected to speak on the matter until there is closure. Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley, who was in a board of regents meeting earlier in the day on contractual issues not related to Donovan, isn't going to speak, either, until there is a resolution. Sources also told ESPN.com the Magic are pursuing former Miami Heat coach Stan Van Gundy, who arrived back in Florida on Monday after interviewing Sunday in Las Vegas for the vacant Sacramento Kings job. Sources said the Magic are trying to get Van Gundy before the Kings make him an offer. Meanwhile, multiple sources told ESPN.com Donovan hopes to reach a resolution soon so he can resume his coaching duties at the University of Florida. ESPN.com spoke at length Monday with those close to the situation, who said Donovan sounds much more at ease with his decision to return to Florida than he ever did in his decision to join the Magic. Sources said the Magic pressured Donovan to make a decision last Wednesday and Thursday, and Donovan, who had admittedly gone back and forth on the idea, finally agreed to take the job. But the problems arose on Friday, when Donovan held the first of two news conferences. The issue was the order. Florida officials felt the Magic should hold the first news conference, since they were hiring Donovan. At that news conference Friday, Donovan was greeted by a standing ovation from the Magic staff. Billy Donovan could become the third college basketball coach in the last two years to last less than two weeks on a new job before returning to the old one: The news conference was euphoric for Donovan, who exited feeling great about the situation. Donovan, according to the Orlando Magic, signed a five-year, $27.5 million contract just before Friday's news conference. But then Donovan boarded a plane for Gainesville and a news conference to say goodbye at Florida. There were tears as he and Foley spoke about his departure. That was Donovan's lasting image and it stayed with him Friday night and into Saturday morning. If anything, maybe the news conferences should have been reversed, but Florida wasn't going to trump the Magic's desire to make a big splash first with the news. Multiple sources said Donovan woke up Saturday morning and realized he had made a mistake. Sources said Donovan felt awful about what he had done and realized how much he loved coaching Florida. Last month, at a reunion for the Providence 1987 Final Four team, former coach Rick Pitino, now at the Louisville helm, said he advised Donovan not to take an offer to coach Kentucky. Pitino said he wanted Donovan to enjoy the benefits of winning two national titles, and he hoped one day he'd see Donovan's name on the O'Connell Center court. Sources told ESPN.com Monday that Donovan had a hard time making the phone calls to break the news to his staff and players, and especially telling Foley that he was leaving. It turned out he didn't feel any better about being the Magic coach come Saturday morning, either. That's when Donovan told Foley he had changed his mind. At the time, Foley was on his way to Richmond, Va., to discuss the Gators' job opening with VCU coach Anthony Grant, a former assistant under Donovan for 10 years. Foley and Grant weren't able to meet, no offer was made by phone, and Foley flew back to Gainesville. Changes of heart have taken place in all sports. Sometimes the decision was the team's. S. Carolina hoops coach The Magic made their pitch, and traveled to Gainesville to convince Donovan to change his mind. But DeVos was out of the country at the time and hadn't weighed in on the matter. He was expected to Monday afternoon. "What it comes down to is that Billy thought he knew what he wanted and that's why he said yes," said a source. "But he realized [Saturday] that he didn't want to be any place but at Florida, but unfortunately he is now entangled in contractual issues." Donovan said Friday that Pitino and Jeff Van Gundy, the former Providence assistant and longtime NBA coach, had told him that the Magic offered a good situation for him, because they have a good organization with young players and salary cap space. So if he were to go to the NBA, this was a great opportunity. Donovan spoke Friday about all of this, and especially noted Orlando's proximity to Gainesville and the smoother transition for moving his family. "Personally this was very difficult for me because my 11 years at Florida were a very great 11 years," Donovan said Friday. "But I really looked at myself in a couple of aspects; one, the easy decision for me personally would have been to stay at Florida, or the next step would be to do something that would really challenge me as a person and coach and help me me grow and get better. "And I've always been intrigued by the NBA. To leave Florida would have taken something very, very special." The question from the Magic now is what they want from him. Do they want him to coach even if his heart isn't into it? Are they willing to move on? Do they want money in return for releasing him from the contract? The reality, according to sources, is that Donovan isn't scared of coaching in the NBA, but he simply realized that he loves the University of Florida. And once he signed the contract, held the back-to-back news conferences and slept on it Friday night, he was convinced that he wanted to stay in Gainesville. The prevailing mood among sources close to the situation is that Donovan will remain the head coach at Florida, the recruits and staff will stay intact, and the Magic will then hope to land Stan Van Gundy, possibly by Monday or Tuesday. Senior writer Andy Katz covers men's college basketball for ESPN.com. The Associated Press contributed to this report. "Sources: Donovan waits to hear from Magic; team pursues Van Gundy" Sources say Billy Donovan has begun talks with the Magic about getting out of the Orlando coaching job.

Spies reclaims title lead with wet weather brilliance Defending AMA Superbike champion Ben Spies stepped up to claim a crucial, impressive victory on Sunday at Road America to reclaim the ’07 title lead. Despite being faced with tricky track conditions in a persistent rain, the 22-year-old from Longview, Texas showed the depth of his talent by pulling free from the field early and building a mammoth advantage as many of his rivals struggled just to remain on two wheels during the 16-lap affair. While most figured that a wet race would actually provide an opportunity for someone other than Spies or his Yoshimura Suzuki teammate, Mat Mladin, with a chance to win, no one proved capable of taking advantage of the situation. In fact, it was Spies who actually benefited most from the treacherous conditions. Still feeling beaten up following Saturday’s fall and desperate to slow the surging Mladin who entered the race with four straight wins, Spies came through in a big way when given the chance. He quickly worked his way into the lead on the opening lap and then added chunks to what became a huge gap with each successive lap. While the sketchy conditions resulted in a few moments for him out there, Spies remained firmly in control en route to his third win of the season. The victory was the 14th of his young Superbike career, tying him with former world champs Eddie Lawson and Scott Russell for eighth on the all-time list. Afterwards Spies said, “My guys had to stay here until about one in the morning last night to build me another bike for today after I totaled that one yesterday. We definitely needed a handicapped race today. In the dry we didn’t have the pace. “The race was good. My crew kept waving me to slow down and I was nodding, ‘I see ya’ll, but I’m not slowing down.’ I was just afraid the track was going to dry and I was going to need a cushion. The bike was awesome in the rain and I feel like I rode okay. It’s good to get the points lead back and it’s a little pressure off my shoulders, getting another win.” Spies was helped out by his close friend Jamie Hacking, who put together an excellent race in the rain for the struggling Kawasaki Superbike effort. The British-born Hacking tracked down Mladin on lap 9 of 16 and held the runner-up position to the flag, crossing the line 11.794 seconds behind the winner. Mladin eased up to grab a safe third, the only other man on the lead minute(!), 36.612 seconds off of Spies. Jordan Motorsports Suzuki’s Aaron Yates (fourth), Corona Extra Honda’s James Ellison (fifth), American Honda’s Jake Zemke (sixth), and Yates’ teammate Jake Holden (seventh) were the only others to finish on the lead lap. A number of factory stars paid for pushing a bit too hard in the wet. American Honda’s Miguel DuHamel, MV Agusta’s Matt Lynn, and Tommy and Roger Hayden all crashed in similar incidents, falling at relatively high speed while still straight-up-and-down, braking at the end of one of the circuit’s long straights. Spies now boasts 307 points to Mladin’s 305 following nine of 19 2007 races. Zemke is a distant third at 232.

They try to follow up one of their biggest victories of the season with another when they open a three-game series with the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday at Miller Park. Chicago (23-31) snapped a season-high six-game losing streak Sunday with a 10-1 victory over the Atlanta Braves in the finale of a three-game set. The Cubs tied their largest margin of victory this season and scored their most runs since May 19. Mark DeRosa hit a grand slam while Alfonso Soriano and Derrek Lee added solo homers for Chicago, which had been outscored 38-16 during its skid. The win also came at a vital time for a club dealing with turmoil. In Friday's 8-5 defeat, Cubs pitcher Carlos Zambrano and catcher Michael Barrett had a confrontation in the dugout which continued into the clubhouse, and resulted in Barrett getting six stitches in his lower lip and a bruise below his left eye. Both players were fined Saturday, but later that day manager Lou Piniella got into some trouble of his own. After Angel Pagan got thrown out stealing third during a 5-3 loss, Piniella threw his cap, kicked dirt on third-base umpire Mark Wegner and earned his first ejection this season. He was suspended indefinitely Sunday and fined an undisclosed amount by Major League Baseball, which said the manager made contact with Wegner during the outburst. Piniella will find out the length of his punishment Monday after a meeting with John McHale Jr., the MLB executive vice president for administration. ''Obviously, you don't see a fight everyday in the dugout, so there were questions with the attention that brings,'' said Lee, who is batting an NL-leading .361. ''The ejection? We knew that was coming sooner or later, so it wasn't too big of a deal. Our main concern was just the way we've been playing.'' Lee has been playing well versus the NL Central-leading Brewers (32-25) this season, going 16-for-28 with a homer, seven doubles and seven RBIs. The teams have split six meetings, with each winning a series on the road. Despite the Cubs' struggles, Milwaukee isn't looking past its NL Central rival. ''The Cubs obviously have a good enough team to snap out of it and rattle off a lot of wins,'' center fielder Bill Hall told the Brewers' official Web site. ''We're not in a state to take anybody for granted, anyway. Look at that Cubs lineup, and you can't afford to do that.'' Milwaukee appears to be finally rebounding from its own slide, taking three of four games from the Florida Marlins over the weekend after losing six straight series. Ben Sheets pitched six strong innings Sunday and Francisco Cordero had a perfect ninth for his 21st save as the Brewers won 3-0. Dave Bush (3-5, 5.64 ERA) tries to follow up Sheets' effort and build on one of his best starts of the season when he takes the ball for Milwaukee. The right-hander held Atlanta to one run and six hits over seven innings on Wednesday, but didn't earn a decision after the bullpen game up eight runs over the final two innings of a 9-3 defeat. Bush, who is 1-3 with a 3.89 ERA in six career starts versus the Cubs, gave up six runs and eight hits over six innings in a 9-3 loss to them on April 6. Chicago counters with Jason Marquis (5-2, 2.93), who is trying to regain his early season form. The right-hander went 5-1 with a 1.70 ERA in his first seven starts while holding opponents to a .175 batting average, but is 0-1 with a 5.48 ERA in his last four outings. He gave up gave up five runs - four earned - and eight hits over five innings in a 9-4 defeat to Florida on Tuesday. Marquis is 4-6 with a 4.43 ERA in 13 career games versus the Brewers.

Mon, June 4, 2007 Yes, injuries should count when the NHL assesses discipline OTTAWA -- NHL lord of discipline Colin Campbell must have Anaheim Ducks defenceman Chris Pronger on speed dial by now. Every reporter covering the Stanley Cup final should do the same with Anaheim GM Brian Burke. Thanks to a shot of adrenalin for the Senators and two shots to the head in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup final, a series has broken out. What started out as a boring sweep in suburban California has turned into a nasty bit of business in Canada's capital with elbows and accusations flying. Pronger was suspended for the second time in these playoffs and will miss Game 4 tonight for his elbow to the head of Senators forward Dean McAmmond in Game 3. After losing Pronger, Burke tried to turn the tables, calling a hit by Ottawa's Chris Neil on Ducks forward Andy McDonald "reprehensible." Normally, you would say that's just Burke. You know his strategy, and that of most executives in this kind of situation: Your guy is the villain, a repeat offender, no less, so you deflect, right? But you know what? Burke's got a bit of a case. In the second period Saturday night, Neil took five big strides from the Ducks blue line and collided with McDonald by the hash marks. Neil's left elbow caught McDonald in the side of the head. Luckily for the little McDonald, he saw Neil coming and twisted out of the way, mitigating the effects of the hit. He went down, got up and skated away. Neil wasn't penalized, but it could have been a charging or an elbowing penalty. If McDonald was hurt, maybe Neil would have been on the carpet yesterday, too. "The most dangerous play in the game (Saturday) night was not Chris Pronger's hit on Dean McAmmond. It was Neil's hit on Andy McDonald," said Burke, who does bluster well. "That's the troubling part for us. We'll take our one game. That's Colin's job and it's a tough one and we'll take it. But the fact there was one hearing (yesterday) is just mind-boggling to me." McAmmond wasn't as lucky as McDonald. So, two hits to the head, neither penalized by the referees. One guy gets up, the other doesn't. One guy gets suspended, the other doesn't. "I don't think this act warranted supplemental discipline if it didn't cause this player to be knocked out," Campbell said of the Pronger hit. Both Burke and McDonald took the head-shot argument - the issue that's been head-and-shoulders above the rest this year - into the grey area of intent. They've got a point. Not many guys get hit in the face with an elbow by accident. An elbow to the head is an elbow to the head for the guy on the receiving end. Burke, who used to have Campbell's job, doesn't think a suspension should only be handed out in the case of injury. When he brought up the Neil hit to Campbell, Burke said, "(Campbell) said the player wasn't injured, so mind my own business," said Burke. "Obviously, I didn't share that view." The league's general managers will be meeting today and Burke said he thinks head shots will be discussed. Trying to differentiate between Pronger's hit and Neil's is a little self-serving for Burke. Looking at the replay of the Neil hit on McDonald, it looks like Neil intends to hit him with his arm and shoulder. When McDonald ducks, Neil lunges so as not to miss and gets him with more elbow as he's delivering the blow. So, what was Neil's intent? He wanted to hit McDonald. Pronger wanted to hit McAmmond. Players need to be responsible. If they cause an injury with an elbow, the consequences should be greater.

What did you change on your bike, if anything, or in your riding, that you were able to start so much better the second time? A I didn't get a good start in the first one, but there was that much water on the track that I couldn't see where I was going. I decided pretty early on that I wasn't going to do anything silly without being able to see where I'm going. Fortunately it got red-flagged. The conditions in the second one were just a little bit more sane. The track was slippery, but visibility was okay. But the first one was a little bit crazy. Q It looked early on like you might be able to contend for the win, but as the race progressed, Ben got by, and then Jamie got by. How were they able to put a margin on you? A They just rode better than me today. A couple of things I seen, both of them, just the first couple of laps with Ben, and then when Jamie came by, I seen a couple things that I can improve on. Certainly one area that I'm lacking in the rain. But again, some of the things that I do that hurt me in the rain, don't hurt me in the dry. The unfortunate thing for people that are good in the rain, is most days are sunny. Q Mat, in the last couple of press conferences, you pretty boldly declared you're not concerned about the championship this year. And you said about the rain, "I'll be throwing it away trying to be a hero if it's wet." So I was curious if there was anything that altered that outlook. MLADIN: Well, I said that I may go down the road if it's wet, of course. I tried hard to win that race. I obviously am not just going to deliberately decide that if I can't win, I'm going to toss the thing down the road. So I think that was a silly question. Jamie Hacking (#2 Kawasaki Racing, second place): Q Jamie, it seems like you guys have been struggling with the Superbike much of the year, but you turned this thing around in a wet race. Is this going to help spur your team on, do you think - give them a little incentive as the rest of the season goes on? A We'd like to think that, but the reality is that we're struggling with the bike, and it's not going to turn around any time soon. We just keep being patient and wait for things that I need to make the bike work. The rain setup is more suited to the bike. It's a softer setup, which is something that I've got on the bike right now, and I can't ride it in the dry, soft like that. So definitely this is a confidence booster for the team, but reality sets back in when we go back to a dry track, and we're back to struggling again. But we're trying. It's not like we're not trying. I came in after the race the other day and told those guys that I won the race. I mean, I rode the bike as hard as I could. It's hard, but frustrating. Today, coming out with the podium definitely makes the weekend go by a little easier, but back in my head I know the reality. Q Tell us about chasing down the leaders. Were you gaining confidence as the race was going on? There were a couple of laps there, halfway, three-quarters of the way through, that you were running the fastest laps of the race. A I started from the third row, which is where I've been every weekend. It kind of makes it tough. Like Mat said, the rain was so strong at the beginning of the race I couldn't even see where I was going. My shield, the mist would stay on it, but it wouldn't roll off for some reason. I had a rag in the dash and kept wiping it every now and then, and managed to reel in those guys one by one. A couple of guys slowed me up there at the beginning. Just put in some comfortable lap times and managed to run those guys down. The bike was really good on the brakes. I could square up the corners really nice and drive. I had plenty of grip. That's what got me up here. Post this story to: &copy; 1997 - 2007

Zito (6-5) allowed a fifth-inning unearned run and six hits to win his third consecutive start. The left-hander, who owns a 0.45 ERA in that span, put the first two runners on base in the first, third, fifth and sixth innings, yet prevented the Phillies from sustaining each rally. Philadelphia went 1-for-13 with runners in scoring position against Zito, who quickly ran up his pitch count while working out of each jam, thus explaining his relatively early exit. The Giants shattered a scoreless tie with five runs in the fifth as they sent 11 batters to the plate. With two on and two outs, Klesko hammered the first pitch he saw from Phillies starter Jon Lieber (2-4) off an advertising panel hanging from the second deck in right field. It was Klesko's second homer of the season. The uprising continued as the Giants loaded the bases on Barry Bonds' walk, Ray Durham's double and Bengie Molina's intentional walk. Pedro Feliz and Kevin Frandsen added RBI singles. With one out in the seventh, the Giants widened their lead to 6-1 on Molina's double, Feliz's single and Frandsen's RBI single. Durham clobbered a two-run homer in the eighth. The Giants emerged with a split of the four-game series after losing six consecutive games at Citizens Bank Park from 2005-06. is a reporter for MLB.com.

He just won't tell anybody exactly how he did it. The right-hander pitched six shutout innings at steamy Miller Park on Sunday, scattering seven hits in a 3-0 win over the Marlins that sealed the Brewers' first series win in nearly a month. It was Sheets' seventh straight quality start, and his fifth win in his last six decisions. Each of Sheets' last four wins has come after the Brewers lost the previous day. "Benny has always been that guy," manager Ned Yost said. "He's our No. 1 guy. You know what he's capable of doing when he gets it rolling, and he's rolling." There have been bumps along the way. Sheets' only loss since April 15 came May 22 at Los Angeles, when he had to leave after 6 1/3 innings because of a blister. On Sunday, Sheets threw 69 of his 99 pitches for strikes and might have pitched past the sixth inning, but with the roof and outfield panels closed because of a mid-game rainstorm, Miller Park turned into a "sauna," Sheets said, and the heat and humidity sapped his strength. Still, it has been a very good last month for Sheets, and the key was harnessing his curveball. Pitching coach Mike Maddux noticed in earlier starts that Sheets was releasing pitches too early, so they worked on an adjustment before his May 1 win over the Cardinals at Miller Park. Sheets made another mechanical fix for his May 12 win in New York that improved the "snap" on his signature curveball. Sheets featured one of his better benders on Sunday. Three of the four Marlins who struck out in the first two innings swung at curveballs in the dirt. How exactly did he fix that pitch? The answer will stay with Sheets. "I can't tell you that," he sang. "Then [opponents] are going to know. The first one made the location on everything good, and the second one just sharpened up my breaking ball." Whatever he did, it seems to have worked. Back in that May 1 start, Sheets surrendered two Cardinals runs before he recorded the first out of the third inning. But then he retired 12 of the final 13 hitters he faced. Sheets' strikeout numbers have increased since the first fix. He struck out 13 batters in his first 32 1/3 innings of the season, including the first 2 1/2 innings of the May 1 start, then he whiffed 35 batters in his next 42 innings through Sunday. Sheets has more than doubled his strikeouts per nine innings, from 3.6 over the first span to 7.3 in the latter. "They're not dominating innings, but they're good innings," Sheets said. And those good innings have brought back the bounce in his step. Yost has said often that you can tell how Sheets has pitched of late by watching his body language in the clubhouse. "I was frustrated early because I didn't have my curveball going for an extended period of time," Sheets said. "It ain't that I care about striking people out. What I was frustrated with early was the fact that I want to be able to get it when I want it. "I want to be able to step on the accelerator and get that big strikeout if I need it, and now I feel like I'm there. I know I can make pitches, so I'm happy with that." If he sounds hard on himself, get used to it. "There's always room to get better," Sheets said. "To say I'm not happy would be untrue, because I'm very happy. But even when I'm going through my best, I'm still looking for that edge. When you're giving up two runs, you want to give up no runs or one run. "When you start throwing perfect games, then you've figured it out," he said. "That's the bottom line." That line made his pitching coach chuckle. "That's a pipe dream," Maddux said. "But mentally, I suppose that's how you go about it. You figure that somewhere along the way you're going to give up some hits and runs, but it's always good to set your standards very high." Sheets has been working to regain his "ace" status since August 2005, when he suffered a major injury in a game at Miller Park against the Braves. Sheets tore the "lat" muscle behind his right shoulder in his 22nd start of the season, and that led to lingering shoulder troubles throughout the 2006 season that limited him to 17 starts. Before those two injury-interrupted years, Sheets had made 34 starts in three consecutive seasons and was the workhorse of the Milwaukee pitching staff. In 2004, he put together a Cy Young Award-caliber season, posting a 2.70 ERA in 237 innings with a franchise-record 264 strikeouts. He is not back to that level yet, but at least Sheets is headed in the right direction, according to Maddux. "He's getting in a rhythm again," Maddux said. is a reporter for MLB.com.

Oguchi Onyewu (R) of the U.S. and China's Shao Jiayi fight for the ball in the second half of their friendly soccer match in San Jose, California June 2 , 2007. [AP] The Americans, who improved to 5-1 overall against China, rose to 4-0 with one drawn this year and stretched their scoring margin to 12-3. They open defense of their North American crown next week in the Gold Cup. China slid to 2-3 in 2007 ahead of next month's Asian Cup, pressure growing after losing last month to Thailand for the first time in 14 years. China will open Asian Cup play in Group C with co-host Malaysia, Iran and Uzbekistan. US midfielder Benny Feilhaber, who plays for Germany's Hamburger SV, scored his first international goal in the 28th minute, chipping over goalkeeper Chen Dong off a pass from debutante Sacha Kljestan to give the Americans a 2-1 lead. China's Shao Jiayi had the best chance to equalize but blasted the ball into the left side of the net in the 72nd minute. Chen denied Clint Dempsey on a breakaway in the 64th minute and dived left to make an outstretched grab to thwart Beasley in the 73rd minute, but the Americans would not be denied. Feilhaber sent a corner kick into the area that Dempsey, the only American goal scorer in last year's World Cup, nodded home in the 75th minute to give the US squad a 3-1 edge. US defender Oguchi Onyewu of Standard de Liege nodded home a free kick from US veteran DaMarcus Beasley in the 78th minute for his second international goal to seal a US triumph.

The Ducks won that game 5-3 and did not lose again in taking the Red Wings in six games. But who would have guessed they would be called to that task again? It is now deja vu for the Ducks after Pronger was suspended Sunday by the NHL for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals -- the result of a hit with his forearm that knocked out Ottawa's Dean McAmmond in the Senators' 5-3 victory Saturday night. It is the second time that Pronger has been disciplined in these playoffs because of a blow to the head and the seventh suspension overall in his 13-year career. He will sit out tonight's game but will be able to return for Game 5 in Anaheim on Wednesday. "We accept the league's decision," Ducks coach Randy Carlyle said. "Obviously, we feel that the player did not intentionally try to hurt Dean McAmmond. It was unfortunately one of those things that happened. "We have to live by the league's action. It's the rules we play under, and you accept it and move on." Pronger was suspended in the Detroit series because of a blow he delivered to the head of Red Wings forward Tomas Holmstrom in the second period of Game 3. On Saturday, the Ducks' defenseman knocked McAmmond to the ice with his left arm after the Ottawa winger attempted a shot in the third period. Late in the second period, McAmmond had scored the eventual game-winning goal with a centering pass that deflected off Pronger's stick into the net. No penalty was assessed on the ice for Pronger's hit but Colin Campbell, the NHL's director of hockey operations, determined that discipline was warranted. "Mr. Pronger used his forearm to deliver a forceful hit to the head of his opponent," Campbell said in a conference call. "Also, his actions caused injury to his opponent." Early Sunday, Pronger had a hearing with Campbell over the telephone with Ducks general manager Brian Burke also present. Campbell said he did consider additional discipline because Pronger is a repeat offender. "We all know how precious it is to chase for the Stanley Cup and to be at this point," Campbell said. "And it's a tough decision to make. We don't take these things lightly at any time. Particularly now. "But on the other hand a player did get knocked out. And that player may not be playing (tonight), too. We're not sure." As he sat on the podium alongside Burke, Pronger said there was no malicious intent. "It was a reaction play," Pronger said. "I stepped up to make the hit and got him with my forearm. And, obviously, you've got to suffer the consequences of what's come down." McAmmond did not skate Sunday, but in a statement released by the Senators, he said he agreed with the ruling. "I think it should have been a suspension because it was a blow to the head," said McAmmond, a 13-year NHL veteran. "It wasn't incidental. It's not like that couldn't have been avoided." Said Ottawa general manager John Muckler: "It's no doubt that he did this on purpose," referring to Pronger. Muckler also said that McAmmond has a concussion.

By Lonnie White, Times Staff Writer 1:06 PM PDT, June 4, 2007 OTTAWA -- After getting roughed up by Ottawa in Game 3, the Ducks probably wouldn't have needed any more incentive for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals. But they found more anyway with the one-game suspension of defenseman , who will sit out his second game of these playoffs for his hit to the head of Senators forward "I wish I could say that I was surprised with the suspension, but I can't," Ducks forward said. "It's unfortunate, but we're going to use it as motivation. That's something you can never have too much of." With the Senators getting a lift from their crowd on Saturday, the Ducks realize that they have to play with more composure if they want to take a 3-1 lead back to Anaheim for Wednesday's Game 5. "It's going to be a game where everyone is going to have to help, not just the guys who are going to play minutes" in Pronger's place, Ducks center said. "We know that we're going to have to play our best game." told reporters Monday morning that the Ducks have been down this road before. "It's a piece of adversity that we've talked about &#91;how&#93; we've dealt with it historically," Carlyle said, referring to an early season stretch when because of various injuries, the Ducks played without goaltender "Key players out of our lineup for almost up to the All Star break. And those are the things that your team learns in the regular season, but, obviously, in the playoffs, it's a little different." McAmmond, who did not return after suffering a head injury as a result of Pronger's hit, skated with his teammates Monday morning and will be a game-time decision. "I actually feel pretty good considering," said McAmmond, who took a shot to the chin courtesy of Pronger. "As far as if I'm going to play tonight, I'm just going to continue on with my day and see how I feel later." said he's not sure whether McAmmond will be ready. "Obviously, we have to talk to the doctors before we let him play, but he's trying," Murray said. "He'd like to play. But in talking to him, he's certainly not 100% at this moment." McAmmond, a key player on the Senators' speed line and penalty kill who scored his first goal of the finals in Game 3, said he's not going to force himself into the lineup if he doesn't feel right. "The headache seems to be going away," McAmmond said. "The neck seems to be loosening up with movement. That's pretty good, but there's other things, too. Just sometimes, if you ever got clunked in the head, you go along, some things you just know aren't right. "If I get out on the ice and I don't feel quite right, then I don't feel like I should be in a situation trying to help this team win. If I'm out there killing a penalty and I don't feel confident that I can compete 100%, then I would not put myself in that situation, or the team. "Again, if I feel confident that I can compete at 100%, then I think everything is a go." That would not shock Carlyle, who said: "Nothing would surprise me. It's playoffs. It's what happens. People make huge strides in their recovery after suspensions. It's amazing." Carlyle also talked about Ducks winger , who suffered an abdominal bruise in a collision in Game 3. "You never risk a player's health or well-being," Carlyle said of Kunitz, who had just returned after sitting out seven games with a broken hand. "Every player will tell you he's ready. This is the Stanley Cup final. Sometimes you have to make a decision that the player doesn't agree with but you don't want to jeopardize a player's chances to come back at a later date." If Kunitz does not play, rookie , who played the first two games of the finals, is expected to take his spot in the lineup.

The victory brought him one step closer to his third consecutive French Open title, but also set up a match-up between him and his mentor and fellow Majorcan, 30-year-old , in the quarterfinals. Until now at Roland Garros, their only competition has been on PlayStation, in soccer, between rounds here. Their games have been fiery, but friendly. “You get so nervous, like if it was a tennis match,” Moya said. “But it’s good to have some fun. There’s a lot of pressure here, and it’s a way not to think about tennis.” Nadal wrote about those matches on his Internet blog, saying Moya was “quite good and assertive.” Both were assertive on the court on Monday, though, with Nadal having to work extra hard in the third set of his match. Hewitt was the first player Nadal has played here who is ranked inside the top 45. Hewitt, overwhelmed by Nadal’s forehands and the spins on them, lost the first two sets of their match, but he did not let go of the third set easily. He pushed that set to a tiebreaker, hit a forehand into the net to end the match. He said the sun had blinded him. Nadal won, 6-3, 6-1, 7-6 (5). “Early on, he was sort of in his own,” said Hewitt, the 14th seed. “It was hard for me to press or do anything against him. In the end, I just had to try to get some rhythm out of him, and try to make it a bit of a match in the third set.” Now Nadal will play his mentor on the men’s tour, Moya, who on Monday played a match pitting two players with a combined age of 65. Through it, Moya never felt his age. In the match against 35-year-old Jonas Bjorkman, Moya lunged after shots. He leaped in the air. He scurried every which way on Roland Garros’s red clay, as if it were 1998, the year he won the French Open. Nadal, who turned 21 on Sunday, was only 12 when Moya hoisted that trophy. “I’m the oldest guy left, but I still remember when I was the youngest,” said Moya, who is in fact the oldest player left in the men’s draw. “Time passes so quickly that you don’t realize it.” While Moya felt spry in the match he won, 7-6 (5), 6-2, 7-5, Bjorkman did not. He had already played two five-set matches at this tournament. He was the oldest male player to make it to the round of 16 since 1972. After the second set of the match, Bjorkman called for a trainer to work out the knot in his right shoulder. Then, he needed a painkiller. His body could feel even worse the next morning, he said. “It could be tough, sometimes, to put the socks on,” he said, adding that the ache he feels in his joints and muscles disappear much slower than they used to. While veterans Moya and Bjorkman played each other in the early match, Novak Djokovic, the youngest player left in the tournament, was trying to make it to the quarterfinals for the second year in a row. Last year, he played Nadal, but was forced to retire because of a back injury. He was two sets down at the time. But Djokovic, 20, feels healthy now and played his best match yet at this tournament, beating Fernando Verdasco, 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (1). After playing a four-hour match against Frenchman Olivier Patience on Saturday, Djokovic bounced back to finish his match against Verdasco in 2 hours, 45 minutes. With that victory, he continued moving toward a semifinal meeting with Nadal, a clay court master. But Djokovic said he couldn’t look that far into the future. For now, he is happy simply to make it this far. He joins fellow Serbian players Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic, who advanced to the women’s quarterfinals on Sunday. “I didn’t come here with the goal to win the tournament, like that was my goal before I started to play,” said Djokovic, the sixth seed who moved into the top 10 in the rankings in March. “Like I said before, I am trying to go step by step, you know.” In another fourth-round match on Monday, Igor Andreev, the player who knocked No. 3 seed out of the tournament in the first round, beat Marcos Baghdatis, 2-6, 6-1, 6-3, 6-4. He will go on to play Djokovic in the quarterfinals. At the same time, Moya will have to pump himself up for Nadal, who has looked up to Moya for years. They have played five times, with Nadal up, 3-2. As motivation to make it past Nadal and closer to the final, Moya thinks of , who won the U.S. Open in 2005, when he was 35. “Of course, I can’t do the same. He is unique,” Moya said. “He’s a legend. But I’d like to approach the legend.” After winning their fourth-round matches on Sunday, neither seemed nervous for Tuesday’s match-up against each other. It is a rematch of the 2003 semifinal that caused Williams to break down in tears because an angry crowd began booing her. Williams was uncharacteristically loose during her news conference Sunday, where she arrived in head-to-toe hot pink, including her flip-flops, which where covered with pink and white rhinestones. She talked about how her life has always seemed difficult, including when she was in kindergarten and never was chosen as the “goose” in the childhood game of “duck, duck, goose.” She said it still hurts to talk about it. “I always wanted to be the goose because I was really fast,” she said. “So, the kids kept choosing their friends. I didn’t have many friends. I never got chosen unless it was about time for recess to be over with. “Man, I need to talk to a shrink about this,” she said, laughing.

Choi devoured a "how-to" golf book given to him as a gift by a P.E. instructor. The star of the book was none other than Jack Nicklaus, the PGA Tour's all-time major winner and the widely recognized greatest player in the game's history. So it was appropriate that Choi was deeply touched after rallying during the final round with a sterling 7-under 65 to win the tournament hosted by golf's Golden Bear. Choi finished off a string of four birdies on the front nine with a 7-iron he carved around trees lining the right side of the ninth fairway to 8 feet of the cup. "A cut shot, Jack-style," he said later with a laugh. Though he carded his share of birdies, Choi made several clutch pars down the stretch, needing only 12 putts on the back nine. He finished at 17-under 271, one stroke ahead of Ryan Moore. Choi earned $1.08 million. Considering the importance of Nicklaus in Choi's life and the high regard for the Memorial and its history, the victory was the biggest of the South Korean's career. "I feel very honored and very happy to be living in the same time as Jack is living, and to win his tournament is so meaningful to me," Choi said. "I can only think that this was meant to be." After accepting the trophy and winner's check, Choi sat down with the media and conducted the following interview with Nicklaus. K.J. Choi & Jack Nicklaus Interview JACK NICKLAUS: K.J., do you want to go through your birdies and bogeys? Q. How about your one-putts? Have you ever had a putting round like that that you can recall? K.J. CHOI: You know, it's my fifth time winning on Tour, so I felt very comfortable, no pressure really, just the fact that it's Jack's tournament just made me feel really comfortable. I think I'm getting used to playing in the bigger tournaments. I've played in a lot of majors, so there wasn't really much pressure for me. JACK NICKLAUS: Give us your birdies. They're probably going to want those. Q. You don't remember? K.J. CHOI: Too many today (laughter). Okay, 1st hole, left side, 15 feet, left to right, and birdie, made it. No. 3, 154, 8-iron and three feet, straight line, made it. No. 6, hit a driver, second shot, 147-yard 8-iron and downhill to 10 feet, made it. 7, second shot, 286, to the front 265, 3-wood on the green. Very impressive today, first time in the stretch down the hill, and two-putt from almost 50 feet. And then No. 8, downhill, 167 yards, 7-iron, and hook lie, 15 feet and made it. No. 9, 3-wood tee shot, and second shot is 165 and a 7-iron, and a cut shot, Jack style, five-yard high cut shot, 10 feet. No. 11, again, Jack style - JACK NICKLAUS: 30 the front nine? Q. That's Jack style, too. K.J. CHOI: No. 11, left to right, and very ugly shot left to right, and five-yard fade driver. To pin, 247 yards and a 5-wood. And then just over green and chip up three feet and make a birdie. 13th hole, first bogey today, and the light windy, and I looking left to right, and very similar 11th driver hole, left to right and then try, still don't move on the left side cross bunker, and it kick bounce and drop down, chip out and two-putt. 15th hole, great change this year. Great tee shot on the right side corner in the fairway, and pin is at 275 yard 3-wood, and it just hopped in the right side corner and stayed there, and 20 feet, 25 feet, and two-putt birdie. Q. You talked a lot about the birdies, but did you maybe win this tournament with pars, not only the last three, but you had a big one on 10 and one on 5, didn't you? You were in the water on 5, weren't you? K.J. CHOI: Today No. 5 on the par 5, only 260 yards. I'm thinking lay up in the first thing, and then today feel a cut shot on the left side corner of the green, and the five-yard cut shot on the right side stay, easy putt because I try and it can't go, and it go straight, and the back on the left in the water. This week the chip and putt is very well, and I like 60, 70 yards, and six yards to drop and a chip and a one-putt. It's a good feel and a good turning point. Q. How long was the putt? K.J. CHOI: Maybe four feet, hook putt. Today why I make lots of putts is hook putt. My first victory in Japan, on the last hole, big hook putt, 10, 15 putt, and I make a par and win tournament and Asian No. 1 and Jack invited in 1999 to play here. Today ten feet and five feet at the last, hook putt. Today, hook putt, very comfortable. JACK NICKLAUS: The last three pars that you made, that's the ones they're talking about, talk about those three holes. K.J. CHOI: Last hole, 16, my nickname is Mr. One Foot. One time, I don't know, hit it very well, and just one foot short and spin back in the bunker. And today, same thing on the 16th hole. But this week, bunkers are very deep and many practicing in the practice area because I know how much spin, how much higher, and I practiced very well, and today very comfortable in 16 bunker shot, and then four feet and make it. 16 unbelievable second shot in first cut, and it never fluid this week. 187 yard in the pin, and 6-iron hit it. I think 7-iron but together, 6-iron is more safe because in the shorter bunker is a very long bunker shot, it's no good, and on the green and two-putt is okay. But pin high, very good. And then get down and keep going, and then 20 yard longer and a flier. Just one thing, fluff shot and chip down and first bank and stop on the green, only two choice. So my style and skip shot is better, is my choice, skip shot and 15 feet and then make it. Great putt. Then 18, so I'm 16 flier over the green, it's a very tough chip, and then 18 over the green is terrible, very tough chipping shot. I said, "Don't go over the green. Short is okay and bunker shot is very well today." So you do a 5-iron to the green upright and then big hook shot, and the right side the bunker, and five-, ten-yard hook shot. But more windy, the more right to left, and then 20-yard hook shot, big missed shot (smiling). And then very similar 16 bunker shot. I have the open face with 70 degree and a high bunker shot and it stopped quick at three feet and make it. Q. There was a mention in the media guide that you basically learned how to play the game or started out by reading a lot of Jack's instructions books and watching video. I wonder if you could talk about that. K.J. CHOI: When I was in high school, right around 16 years old, it was one of those Jack Nicklaus's pictorial books that tells you how to swing, a lot of drawings, gives you the fundamentals of golf. Someone gave it to me, my physical education teacher, at that time, gave me the book as a present, and it just basically showed you how to grip, how to do the backswing, follow-through, just a very basic fundamentals of golf, and I just followed that and that really set -- that's how I really got into golf is by reading the book. Thank you, Jack. JACK NICKLAUS: You're entirely welcome. My pleasure (laughter). Q. Why did your physical education teacher give you that book? Was there any reason? Had you been playing at that time? K.J. CHOI: My PE teacher at the time told me that -- I was only 16, 17. He said, "If you become a professional golfer there's a good future ahead of you." It would be a good profession to take on as a job, so that's why I started reading the book and got a feel for what Jack was trying to teach. At the beginning when I tried it the way he told me to do it, it just felt really good. It felt good, so I told myself, this -- if I really got good at it, there could be a bright future. Q. Was the book in Korean or just pictures or do you remember? Q. Did you read any more of Jack's books after that? K.J. CHOI: Maybe not the first two years. JACK NICKLAUS: They're too hard to read (laughter). Q. The fact that it's Jack's tournament, will that be a bigger deal in your homeland or to you? K.J. CHOI: Definitely it's very meaningful. It's hard to describe in words how meaningful it is. But I just feel very honored and just very happy to be living in the same age, same period, same time as Jack is living and to win his tournament is so meaningful to me. I can only think that this was meant to be. I mean, God planned all this to happen, and I just want to thank God for today. To be able to win this big tournament is very meaningful to me. Q. Will it mean more in your country, too? K.J. CHOI: Yeah. And it also has another meaning for me in that Jack Nicklaus, the image that Jack Nicklaus portrays in Korea is very positive, very clean. He's a very family man, places importance in family, and those are the elements that I place importance in. I think there's a lot of similarity between me and Jack in the sense that I place a lot of importance in my family, too. So that's why this tournament has a special meaning to me. Q. How long did it take you after you read Jack's books to become really good enough to know that you were going to be -- have a chance to be a pro golfer? K.J. CHOI: About three years. Q. I'm wondering when you got the book from the PE teacher, did you know who Jack was already? And then after you read the book, did you kind of follow what he was doing? K.J. CHOI: Yeah, I knew he was famous even when my teacher gave it to me. He just kept emphasizing, "This is a book written by a verrrrry famous golfer, so keep reading it." As I started reading it, I could understand why he was such a great golfer because all the things that were written really started to make sense. Q. Were you nervous the first time when you came over here and you were paired with Jack right away? I don't know how it felt. K.J. CHOI: Yeah, the night before I played with him, Jack had made the cut, and yes, I was nervous. Just the thought of playing with this legend, and to be living in the same era as he is made me nervous. But when I actually started playing with him, he gave me a lot of advice. We talked. He just treated me like his son, treated me very comfortably, and I was able to become more comfortable during the round and it was a very good experience. Q. That was '99? K.J. CHOI: I think so. Q. Third round '99? K.J. CHOI: I think so. JACK NICKLAUS: You could check it, but I think that's correct. It was either the third round or the last round, but I think third round. Q. Jack, you know every inch of turf out here. How difficult was the last putt under those circumstances? JACK NICKLAUS: K.J.'s putt? He had a really tough putt. He had a putt that could do two things. That putt, obviously it should break a lot left, but the tendency of that green, because the property all drains that way, is to hold the putt up, even though it does break left. So it had two features on it that unless you've played here enough -- K.J. has played here enough, he would figure that out. Do you understand what I'm talking about? In other words, the property drains to the east. The hole goes to the east. His putt was breaking to the west. But the east tendency would keep it from breaking really, really sharp, more than it looks, even though it does break a lot. It may be confusing, but if that would have been a flat piece of ground on that putt, that putt would have broken a lot more. That's what I'm saying. Q. Michael, I know you've been over with Se Ri and a lot of the female golfers. We never hear stories about how big K.J. is over there. Can he walk down the street without getting mugged? MICHAEL YIM: You can tell he's got a very strong -- appearance-wise, it's not difficult to notice who he is. Q. Do people recognize him? MICHAEL YIM: Yeah, I mean, people will notice him. JACK NICKLAUS: I was there three weeks ago. I promise you, he's very big in Korea. Q. He's very big here now. You were left off or didn't make The Presidents Cup team last time. This puts you, I think, up to No. 7 in the standings. How important was that for you this year to make that team and how much do you think Jack would be glad to see you on that team? K.J. CHOI: It's just an honor for me to have a chance of playing The Presidents Cup again. It's always an honor playing professional golf when a player gets to play in such big tournaments like The Presidents Cup, and I just look very forward to playing against Jack's team again. You know, I worked very hard to win this tournament, and I'm going to keep on grinding so that I do end up making the team. Q. Who gave you the nickname Mr. One Foot? K.J. CHOI: It's me (laughter). Last couple weeks in tournament, you know, against the wind, and just top, one foot short in the bunker, one foot short in the water. There's a lot of occasions where I have fallen one foot short of the green. It could either spin back and go in the bunker or water. Q. Would you go over your save at 14, please? K.J. CHOI: I hit a five-yard fade shot and aimed to the left side of the bunker corner, and then ball, hit it very solid, long ball, but still moving in right to left windy and pushing the left side kick. And then little in the bank side, very -- no stance. Club in my chest and on the side, and just chip out. JACK NICKLAUS: That's 13. He said 14. K.J. CHOI: That's 14. JACK NICKLAUS: 13 is where you make bogey and had to chip it out. K.J. CHOI: You said 13? Q. 14, the little hump where the bunker is. K.J. CHOI: 144 yards at the pin, and usually my 8-iron is a fade shot. Wind blowing right to left in the flag, and I'm just at left side corner aimed to bunker. And a little bit finally hit and just crossing the face, I think so, and then ball left. Just lucky very soft ground and soft -- and the hands soft on the ball when I dropped it. I chipped it in the first cut and the length and the ball through. It was today impossible short of the hole, and two feet short. It was very good touch. I'm very impressed (laughter). JACK NICKLAUS: It was very impressive. That was a very impressive chip. K.J. CHOI: I'm practicing this area, the bunker shot and the chip shot and the first cut every time the ball go over the green and in the first cut on the left side. And then today, oh, yeah, I think ball be okay. JACK NICKLAUS: Incidentally, that was not in my book. Q. Was 14 the hardest up-and-down? Was that harder than the bunker shots? K.J. CHOI: Today, yeah. Today tee shot -- first miss on the tee shot at 14 tee shot, on the left side. On the right side, just bounce in the woods in the water, a little bit left, but wind still right to left, so very tough hole. JACK NICKLAUS: I think if you look at the success of Asian players on the U.S. Tour and see how many wins there were, I don't think you're going to find anybody that's close to K.J. I think most people would look at that, if you look at the Japanese players, Korean players, Chinese players, south Pacific players. K.J., you've won more than anybody by a lot. K.J. CHOI: Thank you. JACK NICKLAUS: I think that's correct, isn't it? Q. When you said you thought this was meant to be, have you ever had that feeling before? K.J. CHOI: You know, interestingly enough, every time I've won on the Tour, I felt a similar type of feeling; that is, if you're feeling too comfortable all the time, then something is about to go wrong. But if there's a certain amount of tension, there's a certain amount of pressure, not too much, a certain amount, where you're able to deal with it, at one point there's a point where you feel comfortable enough to overcome everything. In each of the five wins that I've had on Tour, I've felt the same thing. I felt that God was trying to use me to spread his words by winning the tournament, and that's how I felt today. Q. The players shot some really slow scores on your golf course. What's your reaction to that? JACK NICKLAUS: My reaction was that we had four days of no wind, we had four days of really easy conditions, four days of humidity, which means the greens never could firm. If we had one afternoon of 10 or 15 mile an hour wind, the golf course would have been totally different. They didn't put any water, I don't think, all week on the golf course. You find that when you don't have -- when you have those conditions, the guys will shoot very low. I expected there to be a lot of low scores and bunched the way they were. It made for an exciting tournament because we had 15 players with nine holes to go that had an opportunity to win. It could have been anybody in that thing. K.J., of course he shot the great front nine and then he followed it up with a good back nine, so that was what happened. I always feel like a good golf course can be shot. I always look at Pebble Beach. Pebble Beach, if the conditions are windless at Pebble Beach, you can shoot Pebble Beach very low. If conditions with windy at Pebble Beach, it's tough. When wind comes up here and dries this course out, it's tough. But we didn't have that. It is what it is. Q. Earlier in the week you talked about the growth of golf in international players. You had pretty much an international scoreboard here. What are your thoughts about that? Are we seeing what we will see in the future? JACK NICKLAUS: All I can say is I think Gary Player will have a lot of choices for The Presidents Cup. I think it's very typical. The game is a global game now. You have another young Korean boy that's playing very well, Anthony Kim, who's done very, very well this year. You know, you've got more of the Japanese players that are playing here, we're now having some Chinese players starting to play. You're getting more players from Asia, but you're obviously getting all the European players, you've got South American players, you've got the South African players, the Australians. The game is a global game, and there's a lot more people outside the United States than inside the United States. Q. That was my next question. What does this mean to the United States? JACK NICKLAUS: Well, we keep playing the United States against the rest of the world. Maybe we ought to play east versus west. They don't understand what I'm saying. We ought to divide this up a little differently, maybe the Americas as a team because it's going to continue to go that way as the game grows internationally. That's not to say that we're not going to have good golfers in the United States, but we're going to have good golfers everywhere else in the world that want to keep, and that's great for the game frankly. I think it's terrific. I have no objection to that whatsoever. I think to see our leaderboard in week and to see that we had I don't know how many Aussies coming down the stretch, but we had a bunch of them. Australasian, when you put it all together, was a pretty tough deal this week. They all played well, everybody did. But I think you're going to continue to see that trend in the game. Q. Maybe you could get Gary to switch captaincies with you. JACK NICKLAUS: I'm quite happy. We've been pretty lucky the last two, only one stroke difference. We may struggle in Montreal, but that's okay. Q. You experimented again a little bit differently with the bunkers this year, and I just wanted to get a quick assessment of how it played out for you, for the field. JACK NICKLAUS: I need to look and see what happened statistic-wise and so forth versus last year and see what happened. You know, I don't think the fairway bunkers -- the greenside bunkers are a big deal. The only thing that's a big deal are fairway bunkers. If you've got a little bit more furrowing in the fairway bunker, that's tough, big deal. Greenside not much difference, is it? K.J. CHOI: No, tough, too. Still tough. JACK NICKLAUS: But it also brings out the best in a bunker player. K.J. is a terrific bunker player. Last year Carl Pettersson avoided -- had one fairway bunker all week, so he did very well last year. Q. Well, Carl mentioned that he didn't play the same way as he did last year. He didn't fear them as much, so his strategy changed as much back to maybe -- JACK NICKLAUS: Maybe he should have done it the other way. Well, I need to assess it, okay? I don't want to answer that question until I can find out where we're going. For one time I won't shoot from my hip, how's that? Q. K.J., what are your plans between now and the U.S. Open, and what do you know about Oakmont Country Club? K.J. CHOI: I planned to take the week off, but I'm going to head down there on Friday and try to get a look at the course. I know a member there, just walk around, play a few practice rounds. All I've heard so far is that it's very, very difficult, and that's -- I'll just have to find out how difficult it is. JACK NICKLAUS: K.J., this (indicating a fade shot) works very well at Oakmont. He'll do very well at Oakmont. K.J. is a high-ball hitter, a left to right player, and I think it favors both of those. K.J. CHOI: Thank you.

http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/06/03/ap3782758.html&cid Brewers Win 1st Series in Nearly a Month - Forbes.com Brewers Win 1st Series in Nearly a Month 06.03.07, 6:18 PM ET Ben Sheets considers the past several weeks for the Milwaukee Brewers a missed opportunity - a failed chance to take an even bigger lead in the National League Central. Sheets pitched six shutout innings and the Brewers won their first series in nearly a month with a 3-0 victory over the Florida Marlins on Sunday. The win kept Milwaukee 6 1/2 games up on the second-place St. Louis Cardinals. "It's kind of a double-edged sword," Sheets said. "It's kind of frustrating that we didn't gain any (ground). But we're fine." Sheets (6-3) struck out seven and walked one to move to 5-1 in his past seven starts. He beat Dontrelle Willis (7-4), who walked a career-high six and struck out none in six innings. It was the first time Willis has pitched more than three innings in his career without a strikeout. Francisco Cordero had a perfect ninth for his 21st save. The victory was Milwaukee's third in four games against Florida. The Brewers last won a series when they swept the Washington Nationals May 7-9 in Milwaukee, giving them a 24-10 record. Since then, Milwaukee has gone 8-15. "It was just a matter of time before we won a series again," Brewers manager Ned Yost said. Willis was vying to tie Cole Hamels for the National League lead in wins. But he gave up seven hits and struggled with his control. Milwaukee battered Willis early, scoring once in the first on an RBI single by Prince Fielder and again in the third on an RBI single by Johnny Estrada. It could have been worse. The Brewers had four hits in the third, including a leadoff double by rookie Ryan Braun, but Tony Graffanino grounded into a double play to end the inning. And in the fourth, with Fielder batting, J.J. Hardy was called out for running out of the baseline after a pickoff attempt. "Dontrelle was good," Marlins manager Fredi Gonzalez said. "It was just a bunch of ground balls that got through holes. He wasn't at his best, but he battled to pitch six strong innings." Hardy had an opposite-field homer in the eighth, his 16th, to make it 3-0. He said it is only his second home run to right field of the 30 in his major league career. "It still surprises me," he said. "I don't know how that happened," he said. Yost said Sheets had one of his best curveballs of the season but told him he was tiring quickly in the sixth inning, when he had thrown 99 pitches. Sheets said the conditions inside Miller Park - which Yost compared to a sauna - were a factor. Because of severe weather in the area, which included a tornado warning just north of Milwaukee County, the outfield stadium panels were closed in the third. Often that makes it hotter and more humid inside the stadium. "I was gassed," Sheets said. "I can probably count on one hand the times I have been gassed, and today was one of them." Still, Gonzalez was impressed. "I don't think I should ever be in the ballpark when he pitches, because I don't think I've ever seen him pitch badly," he said. As a third-base coach with Atlanta, Gonzalez watched Sheets strike out 18 Braves in 2005. "When he pitches, I should take that day off." Willis entered the game 5-1 on the road this season. He has walked five batters three times in his career. The last time came May 9 in a 5-2 loss against the Los Angeles Dodgers. "We were able to make some adjustments within the innings to get some more ground balls," Willis said. "I didn't feel like I was losing any confidence, I just felt like if I could make a pitch, I could get out of it." And he almost did. "I know he has thrown the ball a lot better than that," Hardy said. "We came out there with a pretty good approach, and the fact that he wasn't at the top of his game helped." Notes:@ Marlins RHP Sergio Mitre (right hamstring cramping) has been pushed back a day in the rotation and will start Tuesday against the Atlanta Braves.

http://myespn.go.com/blogs/truehoop/0-25-10/Tale-of-the-Tape--LeBron-James-vs--the-Spurs.html&cid Skip to the content Tale of the Tape: LeBron James vs. the Spurs June 4, 2007 3:23 PM A year ago, when Cleveland faced San Antonio, LeBron James averaged 32 points per game. So you know that, when the Spurs faced the Cavaliers this season, they were taking him seriously. How did it go? Does it tell us anything about what might happen in the Finals? Thanks to the magic of Synergy Sports, I just watched video of every single possession LeBron James had against San Antonio's defense this season. Plenty of food for thought for all those of us who assume San Antonio will win. (I'm thinking long and hard about that at the moment, in fact.) First of all, the Cavaliers won both games. It was 88-81 back in November But that's only the beginning of the story. The main point is that when LeBron James got the ball against San Antonio's defense, the Cavaliers managed to get a good shot an alarming percentage of the time. There were a smattering of offensive fouls, certainly. And a couple of times James forced a pass that was picked off.  I watched 50 possessions, between the two games. Eight times (nine if you count a pretty amazing Tim Duncan block of Anderson Varejao) the Spurs forced the Cavaliers into a turnover, an offensive foul, or a truly difficult shot. Trusting my observations, that means the Cavaliers had good looks 84% of the time. Seems like a high number against any team, but especially San Antonio. Those 42 times San Antonio was not successful? The Cavaliers either: Scored and got fouled. Missed easy shots (which they do sometimes). I have a feeling what happens with those easy shots will decide the 2006-2007 NBA champion. James finished those two games a combined 21-43 from the field without ever really getting on a hot streak from long range. By my count he missed 15 very makeable shots (not counting "and one" opportunities when he missed shots after being fouled), including an alley-oop, a few layups, and several open jumpers. Give James those same looks every game, and he could have some nights when he makes 70% of his shots. This is hardly the final analysis. In fact, how San Antonio defends Cleveland in the regular season may have very little to do with how they handle the Finals after a ton of time to prepare. And we'll all be learning MUCH more as all the preview insight is published. However, here are some things I noticed from watching that video:  Bruce Bowen guards LeBron James almost all the time, except for a couple of Manu Ginobili cameos. Against a lot of players, Bowen is omnipresent and annoying. Against James, Bowen is a barely noticeable gnat. James can use his mighty frame to put Bowen into any and every pick, and then he's often wide open. When isolated against James, Bowen can't do much to bother James' fallaway jump shot, which is sometimes a high percentage shot. With the help of a pick, and sometimes without, James can get to the rim against the Spurs with shocking ease. Now, those of you who watched San Antonio play against Phoenix can tell you that "at the rim" is a nearly impossible place to score against the Spurs. The story is you're better off pulling up in the mid-range (which is the Achilles heel of LeBron James). I am here to tell you, sports fans, that those rules do not apply to LeBron James, who finishes at the rim against San Antonio with regularity -- at least in these two games. One reason is because often Tim Duncan is coming over to help far from the rim, and is not entrenched in the lane. But that only accounts for some possessions. On others? James is that rarest of players who just can score over and around Duncan. The genius of Duncan's defense is that he does not jump. He stays on the ground and saves his jumps for after the shot has been released. But James comes to the hoop so hard, he is so long, he is so strong, he is so fast, and he has a point of release so high, that he can score over or around a stationary Duncan -- forcing the big man into some non-routine habits. see James posterizing Duncan . That play was not entirely typical of the James/Duncan relationship. But note how easily James left Bowen behind when he had a pick and a mind to get to the rim. That happened a The kryptonite of the Spurs is getting Tim Duncan in foul trouble. LeBron James could get Tim Duncan in foul trouble. I'm sure this series will be hyped in some fashion as LeBron James vs. Tim Duncan. Of course, they play totally different positions, and that would seem to be all hype. But, in fact, LeBron James vs. Tim Duncan may prove to be the key matchup for the various reasons outlined here. I should also mention that James does not look remotely scared of Duncan. You know how a lot players go away from ? Not LeBron James. James posts Bowen a fair amount. This is not the easiest way for James to score, but it's a very effective way to get Tim Duncan coming over to help -- and when he gets there, James likes to spin to the baseline and lead everyone on a race to the hoop. It's clear, as that race unfolds, who is younger. More than once, in the half-court, James had layups with Duncan entirely behind him. The Spurs were not "going easy" on James in the footage that I saw. They tried a zone in which three players cheated way over to James. They briefly experimented with a high-energy trapping defense (James one-dribbled away from his man, and pulled up for a made jumper). They sent help early and often. And whenever James beat his man baseline -- where the passing angles are tougher -- as many as four Spurs met the young star.

Associated Press Photo. The Los Angeles Angels are never out of a game as long as Vladimir Guerrero has a swing or two left. Held to one hit through seven innings, the AL West leaders beat Baltimore 4-3 on Sunday when Guerrero hit a two-run homer off Orioles closer Chris Ray in the bottom of the ninth inning. &#8220Something in my heart told me that Vladdy was going to hit a homer,&#8221; Angels starter Ervin Santana said. &#8220He waited for his pitch and he hit it good.&#8221; Chone Figgins greeted Ray (3-4) with a leadoff single in the ninth before Guerrero drove a hanging slider to left-center for his 350th career homer and 12th this season. Los Angeles won for the 14th time in 18 games and improved to 36-22, matching the best start in franchise history (1989). The Angels are a season-best 14 games over .500, and their 22-8 home record is the best in the major leagues. This victory appeared unlikely, however, while Orioles starter Jeremy Guthrie was shutting down Los Angeles&#039; lineup. &#8220It feels very good, especially knowing what our guys did on the mound, to be able to pick them up,&#8221; Guerrero said through a translator. &#8220The hits were hard to come by today. Some solid contact, but their guy also did a good job. Definitely, it&#039;s a huge win for us.&#8221; Chris Bootcheck (1-0) pitched a perfect ninth for his first major league victory. It was the fourth blown save for Ray in 16 chances. &#8220Every loss is tough, especially when you lose in the ninth inning,&#8221; Ray said. &#8220I don&#039;t feel good about it. Jeremy pitched a great game and he deserved to win it. It didn&#039;t come out that way, so obviously it&#039;s tough for him to have thrown that great and not get a decision out of it.&#8221; Guthrie allowed two runs &#045; one earned &#045; and three hits over eight innings. Melvin Mora homered for Baltimore. Angels left fielder Garret Anderson played his first game since April 27 after missing the previous 34 because of a sore hip flexor on his right side. The Angels were 23-11 in his absence. Guerrero is batting .362 with 10 home runs and 38 RBIs in the Angels&#039; 36 wins and .293 with two homers and eight RBIs in their 17 losses with him in the lineup. Jose Molina&#039;s one-out single in the third was the only hit for the Angels until Shea Hillenbrand singled with one out in the eighth and pinch-hitter Casey Kotchman followed with a double. Hillenbrand scored on Howie Kendrick&#039;s groundout, trimming Baltimore&#039;s lead to 3-2. Santana gave up three runs and seven hits over seven innings, striking out eight and walking one. Yankees 6, Red Sox 5 At Boston, Alex Rodriguez hit a tiebreaking homer in the ninth inning on an 0-2 pitch from Jonathan Papelbon (0-1), and New York rallied to take two of three in the series. Rodriguez reached 20 homers for the 12th straight season and improved to 7-for-15 with four homers and 11 RBIs in the ninth inning this year. The Yankees&#039; late comeback from a 5-4 deficit kept them out of last place in the AL East and left them 121/2 games behind the first-place Red Sox. New York tied it in the eighth on Robinson Cano&#039;s RBI triple against Hideki Okajima. Mariano Rivera earned his fifth save &#045; just his second since May 3. Red Sox starter Josh Beckett, trying to improve to 9-0, allowed four runs and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings. Tigers 9, Indians 2 At Cleveland, Jeremy Bonderman (5-0) overcame another shaky first inning and Detroit gained a four-game split. Gary Sheffield hit a two-run homer off Jeremy Sowers (1-6) for the Tigers, who pulled within 21/2 games of first-place Cleveland in the AL Central with a second straight win after going 0-5 against the Indians. Bonderman won his fifth straight start since April 30 after five no-decisions. Athletics 4, Twins 2 At Oakland, Calif., Chad Gaudin (6-1) beat Johan Santana (6-5) for his fifth straight win, and the Athletics took two of three games from Minnesota in a playoff rematch. Alan Embree got four outs for his fourth save. Blue Jays 4, White Sox 3 At Toronto, Adam Lind made up for a baserunning blunder with a go-ahead, three-run double in the sixth. Brian Tallet (2-1) pitched three hitless innings and Jeremy Accardo earned his seventh save in eight chances. Toronto overcame a two-run homer from Jim Thome and a solo shot by Rob Mackowiak. Chicago has lost seven of eight. Blue Jays first baseman Lyle Overbay is expected to miss four to six weeks after breaking a bone in his right hand when he was hit by a pitch from John Danks. Mariners 11, Rangers 6 At Seattle, Jose Lopez had four hits, including a three-run double to highlight a five-run fourth, and Ryan Feierabend (1-1) lasted 7 1-3 innings to earn his first career win. Victor Diaz had a career-high five RBIs with a three-run homer and a two-run shot for the bumbling Rangers. Devil Rays 5, Royals 1 At St. Petersburg, Fla., J.P. Howell (1-0) pitched eight impressive innings in his first start this season, and Tampa Bay got solo homers from Delmon Young and Carlos Pena. Scott Elarton (1-2) lost for the sixth time in six career starts against the Devil Rays. The Royals lost for just the third time in 11 road games.

LOUIS -- When the Reds resume play vs. the Cardinals on Tuesday following Monday's off-day, they will have Josh Hamilton back and reinforcement for the bullpen. As expected, Hamilton will be activated from the 15-day disabled list before the game. The club will also recall reliever Todd Coffey from Triple-A Louisville. To make room on the 25-man roster, outfielder Dewayne Wise will be designated for assignment and reliever Brad Salmon will be to optioned to Louisville. Hamilton had been away from the Reds since May 22 because of gastroenteritis. During a six-game rehabilitation assignment, the 26-year-old was 8-for-24 (.333) with four home runs and six RBIs. Before going down with his stomach ailment, Hamilton was batting .261 with eight homers and 18 RBIs in 37 games for Cincinnati. Coming back from a near four-year layoff from the game because of drug suspension, he was named the National League's Rookie of the Month in April. Coffey was 1-1 with a 4.94 ERA in 26 appearances for the Reds before his May 24 demotion to Louisville. The right-hander had control issues before being sent down. He walked nine batters and hit four more while allowing six home runs in 23 2/3 innings. At Louisville, Coffey had six scoreless appearances (5 2/3 innings) with one walk and nine strikeouts. Salmon was 0-1 with a 4.50 ERA in 11 relief appearances. The rookie had struggled recently, including his last outing, where he walked the only two batters he faced with two outs in the seventh inning of Friday's game at Colorado. Wise, a reserve outfielder, saw limited action and was 1-for-5 in five games. is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.

Great Crew Hosts Cubs to Close Homestand Featured Player: Dave Bush Bio / Stats: [ The Milwaukee Brewers will host the Chicago Cubs in a series at Miller Park to conclude their 10-game homestand. So far, the Crew has compiled a 4-3 mark, and is fresh off a series against Florida which saw them take three out of four games. The Cubs, meanwhile, are coming off of a brutal homestand, where they lost five of six games against the Marlins and Braves, had a fistfight breakout between players, and saw their manager get suspended indefinitely for throwing a tantrum and allegedly bumping an umpire. The Cubs come into the set trailing the Brewers by 7.5 games in the NL Central. Offensively, the Brewers have been pretty solid so far this season. They have consistently been in the top 3 in home runs, and have stayed in the top half of the league in nearly every offensive categories. From top to bottom, there is really no glaring hole in the Milwaukee lineup, even with 2B Rickie Weeks going on the disabled list. The biggest change that the Brewers have undergone since the last time these two teams met has been the addition of Ryan Braun, who was called up from AAA on May 25. Braun has performed well for the most part so far. He is hitting .273, and has already hit more home runs (2) than the 3 base platoon of Craig Counsell and Tony Graffanino hit in almost two months of action. He’s also already added six RBI, and his defense at 3 (one error) hasn’t been bad at all. Prince Fielder and JJ Hardy, a combined 47 years old, have hit a combined 35 home runs, with Fielder leading the league with 19, and Hardy second with 16. The two have also combined for 91 RBI, and have taken turns carrying the Brewers offense. Now that Weeks is shelved with a wrist injury, Counsell and Graffanino are platooning again, this time at 2 base. Both have been hitting the ball better as of late. The Cubs offense has also had its share of highs. Derrick Lee has been hitting very well, batting .361 with six home runs and 33 RBI. 3 baseman Aramis Ramirez has also been hitting well. He leads the team with 13 home runs, and is hitting .356 in the last two weeks. Their worst-hitting regular at this point is Michael Barrett, who is hitting .241. Runs 256 (6) 249 (7) Batting Avg. .260 (7) .248 (2) On-Base Pctg. .325 (8) .327 (7) Home Runs 73 (2) 51 (7) ERA 3.95 (6) 4.07 (7) Walks 157 (2) 183 (8) Strikeouts 391 (5) 399 (4) Starters ERA 4.04 3.93 Relievers ERA 3.75 4.37 The Brewers pitching went through a rough period, but allowed only 13 runs in four games against the Marlins. A couple of staring pitchers went through some rough spots, and the middle relief has been suspect, but overall the staff has performed well. Closer Francisco Cordero has been amazing, converting all 21 of his save opportunities, and allowing just one run all season. Other bullpen stalwarts include Carlos Villanueva (2.97 ERA) and Matt Wise (3.22). The Cubs bullpen has been their downfall this season. Although the overall numbers don’t look terrible, the pen is 4-14 so far this season. Bobby Howry, Scott Eyre and Will Ohman all have ERA’s over 5.00, but closer Ryan Dempster has been terrific in his role, Angel Guzman has performed well in a set-up role, and Michael Wuertz has been solid for the most part as well. Game One: Jason Marquis (5-2, 2.93 ERA) v. David Bush (3-5, 5.64 ERA) As evidenced by his numbers, Jason Marquis has been pretty solid so far in 2007. Signed in the offseason to a 3-year, $21 deal, Marquis went 3-1 with a 2.35 ERA in April, and had a good start to May as well. However, he has come back to earth a bit, allowing at least four runs in three of his last four starts, and he will be facing the Brewers for the first time this season. For his career, he is 4-6 with a 4.43 ERA against Milwaukee, including 1-1 with a 2.25 ERA in Miller Park. He started three times last season against Milwaukee, getting two quality starts before getting beat up pretty good in his final outing of the season. David Bush is coming off a very strong outing in which he held the Atlanta Braves to just one run over seven terrific innings. Before that outing, Bush had really struggled, allowing 12 runs in 12.1 innings in his previous two starts. He allowed six first-inning runs to the Cubs in the first meeting of the season between the two teams before settling down and pitching five scoreless frames. Last season against Chicago, he was 1-2 with a 3.03 ERA. Game Two: Ted Lilly (4-3, 3.52 ERA) v. Claudio Vargas (3-1, 3.90 ERA) Like Marquis, Lilly got off to a terrific start, then has struggled a bit of late, allowing at least five runs in his last two starts. In his only career start against the Brewers, Lilly allowed just two runs (one earned) over seven innings to pick up the victory. That was the same game in which Ben Sheets was forced to leave after three innings with an injury. Vargas continues to work his way in and out of trouble in every start, but for the most part, he’s been solid. In his last start against Florida, he got through six innings and allowed three runs (two earned). In his only start this season against the Cubs, he struggled, allowing four runs in four innings. However, this bad start set the tone for perhaps the game of the year to this point, as the Crew battled back from a 4-0 deficit, and eventually won 5-4 in 12 innings at Wrigley Field. Game Three: Carlos Zambrano (5-5, 5.62 ERA) v. Jeff Suppan (7-5, 3.71 ERA) Everyone by now knows what happened in Zambrano’s last start, when he allowed seven runs (six earned) in five innings of work, and took out his frustrations on Michael Barrett’s face. It will be very interesting to see how he responds in his first start since the incident. He has already faced Milwaukee twice this season, and has allowed five runs in 12.1 innings. Suppan has received a decision in every start so far in 2007. He had his best outing of the season with the wind blowing in at Wrigley Field, shutting out the Cubs in 8 sterling innings. Suppan has been a model of consistency this season, going at least 5.2 innings in each start, and has not allowed more than four earned runs in any start. He is 4-1 with a 3.12 ERA in Miller Park this season. The Cubs were battling the New York Mets for the Wild Card berth, so this was a huge game for Chicago. This was a typical Cubs-Brewers game from the late 90’s, filled with lots of runs and a crazy finish. It was all Cubs for the majority of the game, as they took a 7-0 lead into the bottom of the 7 on the strength of Sammy Sosa’s 64 home runs, and six scoreless frames from starter Steve Trachsel. The Brewers got back into the game with four runs on five hits in the 7 , chasing Trachsel. Bob Hamelin got a pinch-hit RBI knock in the 8 to make it 7-5, heading to the 9 The Brewers put runners on 2 with just one out, but Marquis Grissom popped out to 3 , something Brewers fans had become accustomed to. Geoff Jenkins, a rookie at the time, then lifted a routine flyball to left field, and Brant Brown was camped under it before inexplicably dropping the ball, allowing the tying and winning runs to cross the plate, and dropping the Cubs into a tie with the Mets in a Wild Card race they would go on to win. The drop still remains close to many Bf-netters' hearts, and in some cases, avatars.

(AP) Piniella suspended four games by MLB Klesko, Zito lead Giants past Phillies Lefty Price may be right for Rays in Draft Jackie's work didn't end with playing days Reds' Hamilton to be activated from DL Complete coverage: June 7-8 Draft Latin American history comes to life in DVD Peek at the Week: Big-time matchups MLB suspends Piniella for Saturday's tirade MILWAUKEE -- Cubs manager Lou Piniella was suspended for four games for his actions on Saturday, and he'll miss the team's three-game series against the National League Central division-leading Milwaukee Brewers, which begins on Monday night. Major League Baseball issued an indefinite suspension on Sunday following Piniella's "aggressive and inappropriate actions," when the Cubs skipper allegedly kicked third-base umpire Mark Wegner. The original suspension was believed to be five games, but Piniella talked to John McHale, MLB executive vice president for administration, on Monday to present his side of the incident. Piniella began the suspension on Sunday. Bench coach Alan Trammell will manage the Cubs in Piniella's absence. It's the first time Piniella has been ejected this year, and 60th time in his career. This will be his longest suspension; he previously had served a maximum two-game suspension. The incident occurred in the Cubs' eighth. Angel Pagan had doubled and tried to get to third on a passed ball by Atlanta's Jarrod Saltalamacchia. The catcher recovered in time to throw Pagan out at third, although Pagan and third-base coach Mike Quade disagreed. So did Piniella, who ran onto the field to argue. The Cubs manager went nose-to-nose with Wegner, kicking dirt on his shoes and booting his own cap twice. After the game, Piniella admitted Wegner got the call right. "The umpire was correct," Piniella said. "The guy was out. I was going to argue if he was out, safe or whatever, it didn't make a darn bit of difference." Crew chief Bruce Froemming said Piniella kicked Wegner, and "the rest was show and tell." "The whole world saw what he did," Froemming said. "It was a terrible display of disrespect and [the MLB office in] New York will be called immediately, and we'll take it from there." According to the statement issued on Sunday by Major League Baseball, Piniella was suspended and fined an undisclosed amount for his "aggressive and inappropriate actions, including making contact with Wegner on multiple occasions" in the eighth inning.

Zito (6-5) pitched out of trouble throughout the afternoon to win his third straight start. Barry Bonds was 0-for-4 with two strikeouts and a walk to remain at 746 career homers, 10 shy of breaking Hank Aaron's record. After homering 11 times in his first 76 at-bats, the Giants slugger has only one home run in 61 at-bats since connecting May 8. Ray Durham hit a two-run shot and Randy Winn, Bengie Molina and Kevin Frandsen each had three hits for the Giants, who have won just three of their last 10 games. Zito allowed six hits, walked four and struck out five. The left-hander has an 0.45 ERA in his last three outings after giving up 13 runs combined in consecutive starts. Jon Lieber (2-4) allowed five runs and 10 hits in five-plus innings. He's allowed 14 runs and 29 hits in three starts after posting a 2.50 ERA in his first six. The Phillies had plenty of chances against Zito, but couldn't get a clutch hit. They were 1-for-14 with runners in scoring position and stranded 12 runners. Philadelphia lost five of seven on its homestand after sweeping a three-game series in Atlanta to move a season-best two games over .500. The Phillies are eight games behind the NL East-leading Mets going into a three-game series in New York. The Giants scored five runs off Lieber with two outs in the fifth to take a 5-0 lead. Frandsen led off the inning with a single and Winn had an infield single that put runners at the corners with one out. Fred Lewis followed with a grounder to first baseman Ryan Howard, who was a few feet off the bag. Instead of going to second and trying for an inning-ending double play, Howard hesitated before throwing home to get Frandsen. Klesko hit the next pitch off a billboard on the facing of the second deck in right field to give the Giants a 3-0 lead. A high follow-through on his swing made Klesko's bat flip look exaggerated as he admired his second homer of the season. The Phillies didn't appear to be offended. Bonds followed with a walk, Durham doubled and Molina was intentionally walked to load the bases. Pedro Feliz drove in a run with a single to right and Frandsen's infield single to third made it 5-0. The Phillies had a chance for a big inning in the bottom of the fifth, but only produced a run. Singles by Jimmy Rollins and Chase Utley sandwiched around second baseman Durham's error on Shane Victorino's grounder loaded the bases. But Howard flied out to shallow left. After Rollins scored on Jayson Werth's groundout to cut it to 5-1, Aaron Rowand fouled out to end the inning. With the bases loaded and one out in the first, Werth popped out to shallow right and Rowand hit a bouncer to Zito to end the inning. After the first two batters reached in the third, Utley struck out looking, Howard fanned swinging and Werth flied out. The Phillies again put runners on first and second with no outs in the sixth, but pinch-hitter Pat Burrell, Rollins and Victorino all grounded out. Notes:@ Giants RHP Russ Ortiz pitched two-thirds of an inning, before leaving with an apparent injury in the eighth. ... The Phillies are 6-15 against left-handed starters. ...

Martin Truex Jr., wheeling the No. 1 Chevrolet of Dale Earnhardt Inc., has assumed the lead as of Lap 240 and is holding a four-second margin over Carl Edwards, who won the NASCAR Busch Series race at The Monster Mile just two days ago. Ryan Newman started from the pole and Kasey Kahne led shortly thereafter, but after a pair of competition cautions - -allowing teams to adjust to the green track - the cream began to rise to the top. As of Lap 230, the race had been contested under 140 consecutive green-flag laps and the only driver that appears as though he might be able to run with Truex is Edwards, who led earlier in the race. Kyle Busch brought out the race's only non-competition caution when his No. 5 Chevrolet brushed the wall and Dale Earnhardt Jr. has had a tough day, pitting twice when tires went down under green. Truex led 95 of the first 240 circuits. Copyright © AHN Media Corp - All rights reserved.

Give the Gift of SI Faces in the Crowd Donovan is latest coach to have a change of heart Posted: Monday June 4, 2007 12:51PM; Updated: Monday June 4, 2007 1:23PM Billy Donovan accepted the Orlando Magic job last Friday morning as Magic GM Otis Smith looked on. Have questions or feedback? E-mail Luke Winn. At a press conference to announce 's hiring by the Orlando Magic last Friday morning, nearly 6,500 words were spoken by Donovan and general manager as they sat side-by-side on stools at the center of the team's practice court. Buried in the final 300 words of the 45-minute ordeal was Smith's smiling statement -- in response to what Donovan's first act as coach would be -- that "we gave him the weekend off." "We'll see him," Smith said, "bright and early on Monday morning." That, in retrospect, might have been a mistake. What Smith and the rest of the hoops world would see Monday morning was something else: news that Donovan wanted out, and the Magic -- despite the fact the front of their own Web site (as of 9 a.m.) still said, "Welcome New Magic Coach Billy Donovan: Bringing Championship Spirit to Orlando" -- had resigned themselves to letting him return to his old gig at Florida. High-powered coaches rarely take a weekend off, and this one never turned into a relaxation period for Donovan. By Saturday he had already begun to have second thoughts. Never mind the five-year, $27.5 million contract he'd be leaving on the table. The reversal was set in motion by a call to UF athletic director -- who at the time was en route to Richmond, Va., to speak with Virginia Commonwealth's about the Gators job -- and then an inquiry to the Magic about hitting the undo button on what had been, for them, one of the better days in franchise history. Seventy-two hours after the festive event in the RDV Sportsplex it's as if it never happened. I was there, and I'm pretty sure I saw what I saw: Donovan in a Magic blue-and-black tie, his wife, , carrying a Magic-colored bouquet; a large group of team employees, applauding, after the new coach concluded telling the assembled masses his jump to the NBA "would really challenge me as a person, as a coach and help me grow and help me get better." There was a big white limousine idling outside afterward, presumably to whisk Donovan to the airport for his press conference in Gainesville ... a place from which he was only temporarily bidding adieu, and where, henceforth, he will be known as Billy The (Comeback) Kid. As wild as this four-day roller-coaster ride in Florida has been, it is only the latest chapter in the Year of the Change of Heart in college hoops. When Donovan makes his announcement to return to the Gators later this week, no doubt professing a love for Gainesville he did not fully realize until it was in his rearview mirror, he won't be the first about-face coach of the past 12 months. He'll be the third. Donovan will merely be making a contribution to the developing genre of the take-me-back press conference. On April 2, the day of the game in which Donovan's Gators would beat Ohio State for their second consecutive national championship, Creighton's was introduced as the new coach at Arkansas, which had fired after a first-round loss in the NCAA tournament. In his meet-the-media moment in Fayetteville, Altman said, "I'm 48 years old. And with your permission, I'd like to finish my career at the University of Arkansas." Two days later in Omaha, Neb. -- after realizing the turbulent Arkansas athletic culture wasn't exactly his scene -- Altman said, this about Creighton: "This is home; this is where I will finish my coaching career."

This was essentially the assertion that San Diego manager Bud Black made hours before the left-hander went out and ignored the slippery surface and steady drizzle to do his part to help the Padres to a 7-3 victory over the Nationals. Call it part premonition and part track record that led Black to his hunch that Wells, 44, wouldn't have an issue with the steadfast rain that opened up over RFK Stadium before and during the game. He was only partly right. "I've seen it where the uncertainty of how the game is going to play out will affect some players," Black said. "Most ballplayers like structure ... timeframe. I think Boomer is the best guy for us in this situation." Wells (3-3) did his part Sunday by giving his team five nice innings, as San Diego (33-23) improved to 10 games over .500 for the first time this season. This is certainly a feather in the Padres' soggy cap as they return to PETCO Field to face the Dodgers, with whom they are tied for first place in the National League West Division. The rains and constant scurrying of the ground crew to repair the mound and other wet spots on the field didn't affect Wells in the least. He worked fast by going slow, again leaning on a steady diet of fastballs in the 80s and a big, bending curveball. And, by his account, Wells hated every minute of it. "Terrible, terrible and even worse," Wells said of the slick conditions. "You were lucky to have a dry ball at any given time. It's a lot of wear and tear on you. You're carrying about 20 extra pounds because you're soaking wet. I've never been the five-and-die, but that was enough." Wells allowed three runs in five innings -- two coming on a monster two-run home run by Ryan Zimmerman well into the upper deck in left field -- on just five hits with no walks, which is far more than his counterpart, Jason Simontacchi, could say. Like they did Saturday when they jumped out to an early lead with a six-run first inning, the Padres struck early, as Josh Bard drilled a towering three-run home run over the wall in right field. And while the Nationals (23-34) tied the game with three runs in the third inning, Wells went back to work, allowing two hits over his final two innings before leaving the game. The Padres provided Wells with plenty of offense, and it wasn't just restricted to the one swing of the bat by Bard in the first inning. San Diego scored three runs in the top of the fifth, on a solo home run by newcomer Hiram Bocachica and a two-run double by Adrian Gonzalez, for a 6-3 lead. Wells certainly hasn't been accustomed to such luxuries. Coming into Sunday, the Padres had scored two or fewer runs in five of Wells' first 10 starts, not that it's affected how he has thrown. If anything, Wells has been sharper with fewer runs. He's lowered his ERA from 6.32 on May 10 to 4.79. Really, Wells had few anxious moments on Sunday, other than the three-run third inning. He allowed a leadoff single to pinch-hitter Tony Batista in the fifth inning, got two outs, before Bocachica made a nice running catch of Zimmerman's drive on the warning track in center field to end the inning. "Boomer did a great job," Bard said. "The one thing he did that was big for us was that he threw strikes. He didn't walk guys. He had the one inning where he gave up a couple of runs, but he battled and kept us in the game. Boomer is a professional; he's probably forgotten more games than any of us have played." Because it had been raining all morning and the tarp was on the field when the Padres arrived at the stadium, there was a doubt whether the game would be played. Sensing this, Bard said there was a sense of urgency to start fast. San Diego's Marcus Giles (three hits) and Terrmel Sledge (two hits) started the opening inning with consecutive singles off Simontacchi. After, Gonzalez flew out to left field to bring up Bard, who has been the hottest hitter on this six-game road trip. Bard turned on a Simontacchi fastball and sent a towering shot over the wall in right field for a 3-0 lead. Bard would later add an RBI on a sacrifice fly, giving him six RBIs in his last five games. In that same stretch, the Padres catcher is hitting .454. "I think the biggest thing today is that there was a sense of urgency with the way that the weather was, so I don't know if that focused us in a little more," Bard said. is a reporter for MLB.com.

The Washington Nationals' right fielder played in front of a body of water on the warning track so large it might have been dubbed "Lake Kearns."

(By Nick Wass -- Associated Press) The Nats are nearly as sloppy as the weather Sunday and drop a to the Padres on Sunday.

Save & Share Article "Miserable," first baseman Dmitri Young added, perhaps more accurately. Somewhere amid all those rain showers yesterday afternoon, the Nationals dropped a 7-3 decision to the San Diego Padres, a game in which Washington's sloppy play occasionally matched the conditions. Third baseman Ryan Zimmerman hit a majestic home run, the first ball to reach RFK's 500 level since baseball returned in 2005. But he also committed an untimely error that led to a pair of unearned runs, and the Nationals lost for the fourth time in six games on this homestand. But whatever went into determining the outcome -- a three-run homer from San Diego catcher Josh Bard, a two-run double from first baseman Adrian Gonzalez, a few defensive miscues from Young -- no element was more salient than the weather. The game began in a steady drizzle -- and got worse. "If I ever played in one worse," right fielder Austin Kearns said, "I can't think of it now." A few factors went into the decision to play the game. Though the Nationals and Padres are both off today -- and could have, theoretically, played a makeup game -- the Padres faced a cross-country trip and, starting tomorrow, a significant series with the Los Angeles Dodgers, with whom they are battling for the National League West lead. More important, though, was a logistical problem involving umpiring crews. The crew that worked the weekend series at RFK is due to begin a series in Milwaukee today. The crew due in to work the Washington-Pittsburgh series that begins tomorrow couldn't make it in time to work a Monday afternoon game. Whatever the reasons, the teams were left to play in slop. "About 1 p.m.," reliever Ray King said, "they told us, 'We're on time.' " So each time they looked skyward, they squinted into the fray. The wind blew so hard from left to right that, as center fielder Nook Logan said, "a couple balls that were hit to almost straightaway left field, I caught in center." Logan watched left fielder Ryan Church meander back to the warning track to try to run down one wayward fly ball, battling both the wind and a growing pond at his feet. Church made the catch; "he looked like he was on skis," Logan said. From the outset, that wasn't a good thing for the Nationals. After Marcus Giles's game-opening single off Nationals right-hander Jason Simontacchi, Terrmel Sledge laid down a bunt, his objective to sacrifice the runner over in a game that looked as if it could be shortened by rain. Simontacchi, who missed the beginning of the season because of a groin injury, pounced on the ball and turned to fire to first to get the out.

This story originally published on Is He Coming Back? Posted Jun 3, 2007 After having what he called a difficult 24 hours, Billy Donovan has had an even more difficult 48 hours. ESPN's Andy Katz reported on Sunday night that the former Gator head coach is thinking of returning to Florida if the Orlando Magic allow him to do so. On Thursday night, FightinGators.com reported that Donovan had agreed to take the job only if his former assistant and now head coach of Virginia Commonwealth Anthony Grant agreed to become the Gators new head coach. Before Donovan agreed to terms with the Magic, he was confident that Grant would take the position if athletic director Jeremy Foley offered it to him. Donovan was concerned with his commitment to both the current players and the incoming recruits. After a long weekend of back-and-forth discussions between Florida and Grant, the two appear to be no closer to an agreement than when discussions originally began. With Grant's uncertainty, Donovan is now reconsidering his jump to the Magic. According to Katz, the ball is now in Orlando's court as they hold the key to Donovan's future. The team can allow Donovan to get out of the five-year $27.5 million contract he inked on Friday and return to Florida, or they can hold him to the new deal. A final decision is expected on Monday.

He was 74. He died at his home in Daytona Beach, Florida, NASCAR spokesman Ramsey Poston said. France had been in poor health for much of the last decade &#8212; he was diagnosed with cancer in 1999. Although he was in remission, the extensive treatments took a toll. He never regained his full strength, often had difficulty breathing and had taken to using a motorized scooter to get around. Officials at Dover International Speedway in Dover, Delaware, where the Nextel Cup series was racing Monday afternoon, lowered the flag to half-staff in his memory. A shrewd businessman who was fiercely protective of his family-owned company, France always acted in the best interests of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing &#8212; or NASCAR. His decisions often riled car owners, drivers, sponsors and fans, but France never backed down. French Open: Moya advances in &#x27;old-timers&#x27; battle Cycling: Di Luca gives Italy a champion NBA: James savors the moment "Part of leadership is having the guts to make a decision and then having the guts to stand by it and making it work," driver Jeff Burton said in April. "That&#039;s what he did on a lot of occasions. He did it in a way that let you know who the boss was and also did it in a way that you respected him. And I&#039;ve said it all along, I think that is the cornerstone in our sport." France became chairman in 1972 when he replaced his father, NASCAR founder William Henry Getty France, who retired 25 years after forming NASCAR. He had prepped for the job by doing a little bit of everything during his rise through the grass roots ranks of racing. When he finally took over NASCAR, he inherited a circuit that was ingrained in the tradition of the Southeastern United States but mostly unknown everywhere else in the country. "Other than the founding of NASCAR itself, Bill Jr.&#039;s appointment to leadership is probably the most significant event in the history of the sanctioning body," the International Motorsports Hall of Fame said about the transition. "His role in the impact of the sport has been huge," Burton said. "His personality came at a time when it was what our sport needed. I think he did an incredible job of basing his opinion on what he believed the facts to be and then having the courage to make that decision and see it through. "He ain&#039;t a waffler. ... He&#039;s just going to go do it." Over the span of three remarkable decades, France oversaw the expansion of the sport, parlaying the loyal fan base of the Deep South into sold-out tracks in New England, California, Texas and the Midwest. He also moved the season-ending awards banquet to New York City in an effort to court the Madison Avenue money. In 1999, NASCAR finally packaged the entire circuit together in a $2.4 billion (&#8364;1.78 billion) contract that awarded races to the Fox and NBC television networks and the TNT cable channel that began in 2001. France, who had a mild heart attack in 1997, relinquished his role as NASCAR president to Mike Helton in 2003. He handed off chairman duties to son Brian in 2003. France took the role of vice chairman, reporting to headquarters daily, but moved into a different office a bit removed from the action as he left much of the decision-making to Brian.

Broncos sign Sam Adams DENVER (AP) &#151; Sam Adams, a 350-pound defensive tackle and three-time Pro Bowl player, signed with the Denver Broncos after spending last season with Cincinnati. Adams previously played for Buffalo, Oakland, Baltimore and Seattle. He won a Super Bowl ring with the Ravens after the 2000 season and played in the title game with Oakland two years later. He was a first-round pick of Seattle in 1994, the eighth overall choice in the draft.. Adams, who will turn 34 this month, is known as a run-stuffer but also has 44 career sacks, fourth among active defensive tackles. Adams started all 16 games for the Bengals last year with 25 tackles, two sacks for eight yards and one pass breakup.

A Roland Garros perennial, Moya was nonetheless the younger player Monday, and he advanced to the quarterfinals by beating the 35-year-old Bjorkman 7-6 (5), 6-2, 7-5. Federer, Davydenko reach quarters Serena-Henin set for clash Father: Venus had knee injury Federer hits another milestone Mauresmo's French a flop Hewitt on the rise Wearing a sleeveless shirt and his cap backward, the 30-year-old Moya hardly looked like an old-timer. But he became the oldest man to reach the final eight at the French Open since Andre Agassi in 2003. Moya won the title in 1998 and is playing in the tournament for the 12th year in a row. "Now I'm the oldest guy in the field," he said. "I still remember when I was the youngest guy in the draw, and now I became the oldest. Time passed so fast. ... When you're younger, maybe you don't value things as I do now. I enjoy more now." Also advancing was 20-year-old Novak Djokovic, who beat unseeded Fernando Verdasco 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (1) to reach the quarterfinals for the second consecutive year. "Last year, I honestly didn't expect to be in the quarterfinals," Djokovic said. "I was pretty much satisfied with my achievement. This year is much different." Bjorkman, the oldest man in the 128-player draw, overcame deficits of two sets to none in the first two rounds. This time, he was the one squandering leads. The unseeded Swede was ahead 5-2 in the opening set but lost the next four games. He broke serve for 6-all and led 5-3 in the tiebreaker before Moya swept the final four points, the last with a net cord winner. Bjorkman began to show signs of wear after losing the second set, when he needed a shoulder massage from a trainer. "You know, I'm 35," Bjorkman said. "My shoulder just got more tired than it normally does. ... This is a great day. I obviously surprised myself to make the fourth round." He lost serve in the final game, pushing a tired backhand into the net on match point. The No. 23-seeded Moya, long known for his Popeye-size right biceps, hit 21 forehand winners to three for Bjorkman, and the disparity helped the Spaniard save 11 of the 14 break points he faced. Bjorkman came forward frequently, but Moya often responded with pinpoint passing shots. Moya reached the quarterfinals for the fourth time, but the first time since 2004. "It's much less pressure for me when everybody is talking about Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, and nobody is talking about you," he said. "It helps you." Like Moya, the No. 6-seeded Djokovic benefited from a lucky bounce on an important point. It came in the tiebreaker, when his backhand kissed the net cord before dropping for a winner. Djokovic crossed himself in gratitude. Verdasco retrieved the ball and put it in his courtside bag, prompting laughter from the crowd. Verdasco shanked a forehand on match point, a fitting finish. The big-swinging Spaniard committed 50 unforced errors. "I was stepping in more, and I was being aggressive," Djokovic said. "I played the best tennis in the important moments." Djokovic, two points from defeat in a five-set win Saturday over Olivier Patience, will next play the winner of the match between No. 16 Marcos Baghdatis and unseeded Igor Andreev. Moya will play the winner of the match between two-time defending champion Nadal, seeded second, and No. 14 Lleyton Hewitt. In the women's quarterfinals Tuesday, two-time defending champion Justine Henin will face eight-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams in a rematch of their contentious 2003 semifinal at Roland Garros. Williams advanced Sunday by beating No. 10 Dinara Safina. Henin defeated No. 20 Sybille Bammer 6-2, 6-4. Jelena Jankovic and Nicole Vaidisova meet for the other semifinal spot in the top half of the draw. The bottom half includes three Russians - Maria Sharapova will play Anna Chakvetadze, and Svetlana Kuznetsova faces Serbian Ana Ivanovic.

The New York Yankees don't plan on pulling the plug on the Roger Clemens experiment even though the right-hander is battling a groin problem and the team is struggling so badly, MLB.com reported Monday. The Yankees don't owe Clemens any money on his prorated $28 million contract yet because he hasn't pitched in a Major League game yet. But general manager Brian Cashman rejected any notion that the team would change its mind about bringing on Clemens, MLB.com reported. "I want to have a healthy Roger Clemens, when he's ready, to assist this team because we still have a shot," Cashman said, MLB.com reported. "We're in this thing, we're not out of it. He can make an impact for us." The Yankees, who trailed the Boston Red Sox by 5 1/2 games in the AL East when they signed Clemens, are now 12 1/2 games out. Cashman did leave himself an out, saying Clemens was "no different than anyone else on a minor-league contract -- there's no guarantees," the Bergen (N.J.) Record reported Monday. Clemens will have tests on his ailing groin Monday, and the Yankees hope he can make his first start of the season next weekend. New York manager Joe Torre said Sunday that Clemens could pitch Saturday against Pittsburgh, five days after he was originally slated to return to the struggling Yankees before being scratched because of a fatigued right groin. â€œWeâ€™re tentatively looking at possibly next weekend,â€ Torre said. â€œThe only thing I know is heâ€™s going to have an MRI (on Monday) and weâ€™ll have more information. Theyâ€™ll see if whatever heâ€™s dealing with is old or new.â€ Matt DeSalvo was scheduled to come up from the minors and start in Clemensâ€™ place Monday night at the Chicago White Sox. Kei Igawa, who had been another option, pitched in a Triple-A game Sunday for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Torre said Igawa pitched well, but Scranton pitching coach Dave Eiland said the left-hander needs another minor league outing. The MRI wonâ€™t be the only factor that determines whether Clemens pitches on Saturday. â€œHeâ€™s going to be the one that has to feel (ready),â€ Torre said. â€œWe certainly donâ€™t want him to say, â€˜Well, I can pitch with this.â€™ â€œItâ€™s too important that he goes out there every five days or so (rather than) have one start and then maybe the next start you donâ€™t have him. So we want to make sure this gets well.â€ Slide show: Week in Sports Pictures Week in Sports Pictures King James dunks, Duke suffers defeat and royal celebrations erupt this week. Clemens, 44, probably would provide an emotional lift when he returns, though Torre isnâ€™t focused on that. â€œWeâ€™ve had a habit of never counting our chickens until they show up,â€ he said, â€œso we really never got to the point of feeling he was here.â€ ALSO ON THIS STORY A-Rod powers Yankees past Red Sox Discuss: Sound off on our baseball message boards Clemens had three minor league tuneup starts, the most recent last Monday when he gave up two hits and struck out six in six scoreless innings for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. The seven-time Cy Young Award winner felt pain in his groin during that outing. Cashman said it was possible Clemensâ€™ next appearance would be in the minors. â€œI would not rule anything out,â€ he said.

(Bill) France, whose firm hand and visionary approach built stock-car racing into one of America’s most successful sports and business enterprises, died June 4 at his home in Daytona Beach. He was 74 and had been in failing health for several years. France was the eldest son of NASCAR and International Speedway Corporation founder, the late William Henry Getty (Big Bill) France and his wife, Anne. Even though he wasn’t technically a Junior, William C. France often was spoken of as Bill Jr., Little Bill or Billy. He took over from his larger-than-life father as president of NASCAR in January 1972 and spent almost 28 years building the Daytona Beach-based sanctioning body into a billion-dollar industry. He gave that position to Mike Helton in 2000 but remained as chairman of the board and CEO until October 2003, when he stepped aside in favor of his son, Brian Z. France. France struggled with a series of illnesses and setbacks in recent years. A longtime smoker, he suffered a mild heart attack on the way to a NASCAR exhibition race in Japan in 1997. He was diagnosed with cancer in 1999 and had heart surgery and hip surgery in 2001. He seldom ventured out in public in recent years, even to major NASCAR events. He was confined to a wheelchair several years ago. He is survived by his wife, Betty Jane; his son, Brian; his daughter, Lesa France Kennedy; and his younger brother, Jim. All are or have been deeply involved in the family-run business for most of their lives. His wife served for years as NASCAR’s assistant secretary; his son is chairman of the board and CEO of NASCAR; his daughter is vice president and assistant treasurer of NASCAR and president of ISC; and his brother is vice chairman and executive vice president of NASCAR and ISC. France’s entire life was spent around the sport and the business that grew from it. As a teenager, he worked at speedway concessions stands while his parents and their associates tended to more weighty matters. He sold tickets and worked in various capacities in the NASCAR offices when the staff may not have numbered more than a dozen or so. Even while he was in high school, then at the University of Florida, then in the Navy, his attention was never far from stock-car racing and its slowly growing popularity. After his two-year Navy stint, he was “promoted” to flagman, scorer and race steward, clear indication that his father expected him to know everything about the sport. He was vice president of NASCAR for six years before succeeding his father in 1972. His first major contribution was to complete negotiations to land the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company as sponsor of NASCAR’s top-line series. France—certainly with his father’s approval—reduced the schedule from upward of 50 races (many of them midweek dirt-track events in small markets) to about 30 races, all on weekends and on paved tracks. NASCAR spent much of the ’70s expanding and growing slowly, then exploded in the ’80s as a result of increasing television coverage and a heavy dose of national marketing built around the drivers and their sponsors. Many feel the ’79 Daytona 500 was the event that turned America toward racing. Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison wrecked each other while running 1-2 on the last lap. Richard Petty slipped by for his seventh and final 500 victory. Moments later, CBS TV caught Yarborough and Allison (with Bobby Allison joining in) fighting near the accident scene in turn three. When asked two days later whether he planned to fine the Allisons and Yarborough for fighting, France boomed through the phone line: “Fine ’em? Fine ’em, you ask? Hell, man, I might just give ’em a bonus. You can’t buy publicity like that.” France was something of a pioneer in convincing major corporations that stock-car racing could benefit them and NASCAR as well. He and his staff hammered out lucrative TV packages with ESPN and CBS and, later, Fox, NBC and TNN. He dramatically increased national media exposure by taking the sport’s annual postseason awards banquet to New York City and getting it on TV. Always looking for new fans and marketing opportunities, he scheduled three exhibition races in Japan and signed off on NASCAR running Busch Series points races in Mexico and Canada. France never forgot who helped get the sport where it is today. He often spoke glowingly of NASCAR fans as “the people who build things and win wars for this country.” He was on a first-name basis with presidents, captains of industry, entertainment icons and other sports giants. But he was, at heart, a racer, a man who was never happier or more at home than while wandering through the garages and talking to drivers, crewmen, owners and the media at a NASCAR speedway on the morning of a race. After all, at the end of the day, they were his people. Bill France Jr. transformed stock car racing from a small Southern sport into the billion-dollar NASCAR conglomerate. During his tenure as NASCAR boss, France Jr. brought NASCAR to the masses by negotiating television deals and promoting races.

Condolences from around the motorsports world The world of racing has lost a true innovator in Bill France, Jr., who made NASCAR the premiere sport it is today. His vision, tenacity and friendship will be missed. He left the sport better and provided the foundation for continued growth. Chevrolet and General Motors extends its thoughts and prayers to the France family. Brent Dewar; General Motors North America Vice President of Vehicle Sales, Service and Marketing "Like his father before him, Bill France Jr. was a pioneer and will be remembered for so many contributions while growing stock car racing into a national pastime during NASCAR's modern era. We offer our condolences to his wife, Betty Jane, his children, Brian and Lesa, the rest of the family and all who mourn his loss." George Bodenheimer; ESPN and ABC Sports President On behalf of the staff of Michigan International Speedway, we are deeply saddened by the news of Bill France's death. Mr. France was a great American, and truly embodied the American entrepreneurial spirit. He transformed the auto racing industry into what it is today and was a historic figure that helped build the foundation of motorsports with his knowledge of business and love for auto racing. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Betty Jane, the rest of his family and the entire racing community as they deal with the loss of such a great man and leader. Roger Curtis; Michigan International Speedway President "Bill France Jr. was more than a good friend of mine. He was a legend in motor racing. NASCAR and motor racing worldwide would not have seen the growth and prosperity it has without Bill's vision and determination. He single-handedly made it the reality it is today by understanding what the fans wanted and by creating an environment where on-track competition was king. Bill also understood and encouraged the automobile manufacturers to become a major part of the sport. I personally loved the opportunities I had to sit with him, discussing racing, business and family. He had a wonderful perspective on everything going on around him. Everyone at Ford, and me personally, lost a great friend today." Edsel B. Ford II; member, Board of Directors, Ford Motor Company "Everyone involved in the Ford Racing program is thinking of the France family and wishing them the best at this very difficult time. There's no way to put into words how much Bill France Jr. meant to NASCAR and auto racing in general, because if it wasn't for him, this sport obviously wouldn't be where it is today. He wanted to take NASCAR from a regional sport to something that is followed worldwide, and with great determination, he made that vision come true. Every sport needs a strong leader at the top in order to be successful and no organization had a man that stood taller these last four decades than Bill France Jr. We will truly miss him." Dan Davis; director, Ford Racing Technology "In the community of motorsports there are individuals whose accomplishments, commitment, leadership and vision set the precedent for the successes we see today. Mr. France stood above his peers with qualities we should all emulate and appreciate. His faith in motorsports in America will stand the test of time and he will always be an essential part of the fabric of our culture and sport." Paul Gentilozzi; race driver and Champ Car co-owner Bill France Jr. was not only a leader in our sport but he was also a very good friend. Not only did he teach me a lot about our sport but he taught me numerous lessons about life. Over the last several years, NASCAR has grown to an unprecedented level of popularity. None of that would have been possible without the vision and leadership Mr. France provided. My thoughts and prayers go out to Betty Jane, Brian, Lesa and the entire France family. Richard Childress; president and CEO of Richard Childress Racing "We are deeply saddened to learn of today's passing of Bill France," said Jeff Boerger, Kansas Speedway President. "Mr. France and Lesa Kennedy had the vision to expand NASCAR to the Midwest and build Kansas Speedway, which has is one of the top tracks on the NASCAR circuit. This has been an extremely difficult year for the NASCAR family which has also lost Benny Parsons and Bobby Hamilton. The staff at Kansas Speedway and I join the rest of NASCAR nation in mourning Mr. France's passing." "My father will be sorely missed, not only by our family, but by all the lives he touched over his many years in the sport," said ISC President Lesa France Kennedy. "From drivers to owners to other track operators and professionals in the racing world, Bill France served as a champion for motorsports and his legacy is the renowned success that NASCAR and ISC have, and will continue to achieve."

Click me to Rafael Nadal beats Lleyton Hewitt to reach French Open quarter-finals Rafael Nadal, of Spain, throws his armband to supporters after beating Lleyton Hewitt, of Australia. (AP Photo/Francois Mori) Steven Wine, Canadian Press Published: Monday, June 04, 2007 PARIS (AP) - Rafael Nadal completed the men's quarter-final field at the French Open on Monday, sweeping Lleyton Hewitt 6-3, 6-1, 7-6 (5). The two-time defending champion from Spain is 18-0 lifetime in the tournament, which seems to be getting easier for him: For the first time, he reached the final eight without losing a set. A potential showdown looms Sunday between the No. 2-seeded Nadal and top-ranked Roger Federer, who seeks his first French Open title to complete a career Grand Slam. Nadal's opponent Wednesday will be fellow Spaniard Carlos Moya, the 1998 champion. "I prefer to lose against him than against any other player, because he is a great friend," Nadal said. "He did a lot of things for me when I arrived on the men's circuit." Moya declined to take credit for Nadal's dominance. "I don't think he learned anything from me," Moya said. "And if he did, he did it much better than me." The other quarter-final Wednesday will be between No. 125-ranked Igor Andreev of Russia and No. 6-seeded Novak Djokovic of Serbia. Andreev, who eliminated No. 3-seeded Andy Roddick in the opening round, advanced to his first major quarter-final by rallying past No. 16 Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus 2-6, 6-1, 6-3, 6-4. Djokovic swept unseeded Fernando Verdasco of Spain 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (1) to reach the final eight for the second consecutive year. "Last year, I honestly didn't expect to be in the quarter-finals," said Djokovic, 20. "I was pretty much satisfied with my achievement. This year is much different." The marquee pairing in the women's quarter-finals Tuesday features two-time defending champion Justine Henin of Belgium against eight-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams of the U.S. It's a rematch of their contentious 2003 semifinal at Roland Garros. Hewitt had beaten Nadal in four of their six previous meetings, but on clay the matchup of baseliners was a mismatch from the outset. Nadal won 16 of the first 20 points. The No. 14-seeded Hewitt led for most of the third set and held advantages of 4-2 and 5-4 in the tiebreaker. But he blew an easy forehand to make it 5-all, then netted another easy forehand on the final point. Nadal displayed racket wizardry even between points, when he drew applause for an over-the-shoulder catch on the strings of a ball lobbed from the other end of the court. He's bidding to become the first man to win a third consecutive French Open title since Bjorn Borg was champion in 1978-81. Moya overcame his relative inexperience to beat Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman. A Roland Garros perennial, Moya was nonetheless the younger player Monday, and he swept the 35-year-old Bjorkman 7-6 (5), 6-2, 7-5. Wearing a sleeveless shirt and his cap backward, the 30-year-old Moya hardly looked like an old-timer. But he became the oldest man to reach the final eight at the French Open since Andre Agassi in 2003.

That intrigue will dissipate as soon as the puck drops on the game, regardless of whether the fourth-line center plays. The natural course of events will dictate that a role player, no matter whether that role player is having a wonderful spring -- as McAmmond is -- is relegated to sidebar status. Ross Dettman for ESPN The Magazine Chris Pronger received a one-game suspension for his hit on Dean McAmmond in Game 3 of the Cup finals. It's something McAmmond had better get used to. There are sometimes parallels between the hockey world and the criminal justice system, especially when it comes to victims. The focus is mostly on the perpetrators. They evoke the strongest emotions and often are simply the most interesting characters. The victims? Often they fade into the background. McAmmond, the victim of the latest violent outburst, exists in that strange limbo world between pursing a boyhood dream of playing in the Stanley Cup finals and becoming irrelevant. McAmmond was knocked unconscious with a flying Pronger elbow early in the third period of Game 3 on Saturday night. He skated for the first time since the hit Monday morning, but it's unknown whether he'll play in Game 4. He acknowledged that he could ride an exercise bike for only four or five minutes Sunday and didn't feel quite right. He skated and did a little more Monday morning, but although the headaches are receding and the stiffness in the neck seems to have subsided, there's still something in his head that isn't where it needs to be. "I rode today. I didn't have as much discomfort. But because of the kind of the whiplash, for lack of a better term, maybe that's the exact term, I have a lot of stiffness in my neck and whatnot," McAmmond said in his first public comments about the hit (he did make a comment via news release after Pronger's suspension was announced Sunday). "The headache seems to be going away," McAmmond said. "The neck seems to be loosening up with movement. That's pretty good, but there's other things, too. Just sometimes, if you ever got clunked in the head, you go along. Some things you just know aren't right. It just doesn't feel right." Ottawa coach Bryan Murray was likewise uncertain as to McAmmond's availability. "He's taking a light skate. We'll see how he feels afterwards," Murray said. "Obviously, we have to talk to the doctors before we let him play, but he's trying. He'd like to play. But in talking to him, he's certainly not 100 percent at this moment." Anaheim coach Randy Carlyle was asked whether he would be surprised if McAmmond played Monday and answered quite cattily that "People make huge strides in their recovery after suspensions. It's amazing." The implication, of course, is that McAmmond somehow embellished being knocked unconscious by 6-foot-6 Pronger, who is sitting out a league-imposed suspension for the seventh time in his career. Here's the thing, though. Sometimes, players don't come back right away. Sometimes, they don't play that night or the next night or the night after that. McAmmond recalled being in Calgary and seeing teammate take an elbow in a playoff game from . The blow left Lombardi unable to play for weeks. "I feel like I seem to be back on that track [to recovery], so I'd like to be in the lineup tonight. And there's a chance. It's just a matter of if you rush it too quick, you maybe set yourself back again," McAmmond said. McAmmond said that he has seen the replay and that it has helped him fill in some of what were blurry gaps in the evening. "Actually, after watching the play, I kind of faintly remember getting that loose puck [shortly before the hit]," McAmmond said. "But up until that point, I couldn't remember much past being in the dressing room in the second intermission and then up to where they got me back to the dressing room after the hit." The 33-year-old native of Grand Cache, Alberta, said he harbors no ill will toward Pronger. "I'm really not that way. I wouldn't want anything bad to happen to him in return or anything like that," McAmmond said. Regardless of when he might return to action, as early as Monday or sometime down the road, soft-spoken McAmmond hasn't lost his sense of humor. Asked whether he had any discomfort while shooting, he said, "Yeah, for about 16 years now." Scott Burnside is the NHL writer for ESPN.com.

http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/49-06042007-1357242.html&cid New car rests on slippery slope (phillyBurbs.com) | Auto Racing Relationships w/ Wayne & Tamara New car rests on slippery slope DOVER, Del. — The “Monster Mile” can be daunting. It could be doubly uncomfortable today for Nextel Cup drivers if their new Car of Tomorrow doesn't cooperate on the demanding Dover concrete oval. Few have a clue how the series' latest chassis modification will adapt on the multi-grooved track. The Car of Tomorrow was designed to improve safety and competition and reduce costs, but many drivers have complained about the handling of the car in the turns. Dover figures to be the most demanding test yet for the Car of Tomorrow, especially considering that the drivers go into the Autism Speaks 400 without a full test session at the track. The Autism Speaks 400 was postponed by rain Sunday until noon today. That gave drivers another day to weigh uncertainty. Most don't have a baseline on how the boxy, balky car will negotiate the high banks and heavy traffic of Dover. A previously scheduled May 14-15 test session at Dover for the Car of Tomorrow was cancelled due to rain the previous weekend that pushed back the Darlington race. Instead, the test scheduled for Dover was run at Virginia International Raceway, and Kyle Busch didn't learn much. “I wish we were able to come here and test because it is so much different than what we had before,” Busch said. “We are lifting five, eight car lengths sooner than we used to, and it is really, really loose for me getting into the corner.” “Dover is a tough place because you always want to drive hard,” said Kurt Busch. “Thebanking invites you to drive into the corners hard and fast, but you're going to abuse your right front tires.” Jimmie Johnson, second in the Nextel Cup point standings, will start way back in 27th. With three Dover wins in 10 tries, he'll lean on his experience and his crew's ability to adjust in order to navigate his way from the back “I think that this track is really difficult to drive,” Johnson said. “If your set-up is not right it is really, really challenging, so in terms of more inexperienced teams and drivers, I think that gap will show more here than other places.” Led by pole-sitter Ryan Newman, Dodge owns four of the top 10 qualifying spots. “This is one of my favorite racetracks,” said Newman, who has finished on the lead lap in 80 percent of his Dover races — the best percentage of any active driver. Chevrolet has won 11 of the first 12 Nextel Cup races this season. That's the best start by a manufacturer since Chevy won the first seven events in '95, and nine of the first 11...Ford has won the last three Cup races at Dover. There are only three Ford drivers among the top 12 qualifiers — Carl Edwards (fifth), Jamie McMurray (eighth) and Greg Biffle (10th). ... Tony Stewart's average Dover finish of 8.9 is the best among active drivers. In the two Dover events last year, however, Stewart finished 25th and 33rd. ... Six different drivers have won the last six Dover races. ... Last year's winners, Matt Kenseth and Jeff Burton, both started 19th. ... While Hendrick Motorsports has won all five Car of Tomorrow races, Gibbs Racing has led the most laps in those events employing the new-styled Nextel Cup car. Stewart and teammate Denny Hamlin have led 973 C of T laps. Hendrick drivers have led 615. ... The combined margin of victory in the five COT races has been 2.527 seconds — an average of 0.505.

http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/06/04/ap3785478.html&cid Nadal Beats Hewitt to Reach French Final - Forbes.com Nadal Beats Hewitt to Reach French Final 06.04.07, 12:49 PM ET Rafael Nadal strokes are always accompanied by lots of grunting, so the French Open must be more difficult than he makes it look. Still unbeaten at Roland Garros, Nadal completed the men's quarterfinal field Monday by sweeping Lleyton Hewitt 6-3, 6-1, 7-6 (5). The two-time defending champion is 18-0 lifetime in the tournament, which seems to be getting easier for him: For the first time, he reached the final eight without losing a set. A potential showdown looms Sunday between the No. 2-seeded Nadal and top-ranked Roger Federer, who seeks his first French Open title to complete a career Grand Slam. Nadal's opponent Wednesday will be fellow Spaniard Carlos Moya, the 1998 champion. "I prefer to lose against him than against any other player, because he is a great friend," Nadal said. "He did a lot of things for me when I arrived on the men's circuit." Moya declined to take credit for Nadal's dominance. "I don't think he learned anything from me," Moya said. "And if he did, he did it much better than me." The other quarterfinal Wednesday will be between No. 125-ranked Igor Andreev and No. 6-seeded Novak Djokovic. Andreev, who eliminated No. 3-seeded Andy Roddick in the opening round, advanced to his first major quarterfinal by rallying past No. 16 Marcos Baghdatis 2-6, 6-1, 6-3, 6-4. Djokovic swept unseeded Fernando Verdasco 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (1) to reach the final eight for the second consecutive year. "Last year, I honestly didn't expect to be in the quarterfinals," said Djokovic, 20. "I was pretty much satisfied with my achievement. This year is much different." The marquee pairing in the women's quarterfinals Tuesday features two-time defending champion Justine Henin against eight-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams. It's a rematch of their contentious 2003 semifinal at Roland Garros. Hewitt had beaten Nadal in four of their six previous meetings, but on clay the matchup of baseliners was a mismatch from the outset. Nadal won 16 of the first 20 points. The No. 14-seeded Hewitt led for most of the third set and held advantages of 4-2 and 5-4 in the tiebreaker. But he blew an easy forehand to make it 5-all, then netted another easy forehand on the final point. Nadal displayed racket wizardry even between points, when he drew applause for an over-the-shoulder catch on the strings of a ball lobbed from the other end of the court. He's bidding to become the first man to win a third consecutive French Open title since Bjorn Borg was champion in 1978-81. Moya overcame his relative inexperience to beat Jonas Bjorkman. A Roland Garros perennial, Moya was nonetheless the younger player Monday, and he swept the 35-year-old Bjorkman 7-6 (5), 6-2, 7-5. Wearing a sleeveless shirt and his cap backward, the 30-year-old Moya hardly looked like an old-timer. But he became the oldest man to reach the final eight at the French Open since Andre Agassi in 2003. Moya has won two of his previous five matches against Nadal. "It's going to be a beautiful match to play," Moya said, "and very tough for both of us." Once ranked No. 1, Moya is playing in the tournament for the 12th year in a row. "Now I'm the oldest guy in the field," he said. "I still remember when I was the youngest guy in the draw, and now I became the oldest. Time passed so fast. ... "When you're younger, maybe you don't value things as I do now. I enjoy more now." Bjorkman, the oldest man in the 128-player draw, overcame deficits of two sets to none in the first two rounds. But this time he was the one squandering leads. The unseeded Swede was ahead 5-2 in the opening set but lost the next four games. He broke serve for 6-all and led 5-3 in the tiebreaker before Moya swept the final four points, the last with a net cord winner. Bjorkman began to show signs of wear after losing the second set, when he needed a shoulder massage from a trainer. "You know, I'm 35," Bjorkman said. "My shoulder just got more tired than it normally does. ... This is a great day. I obviously surprised myself to make the fourth round." He lost serve in the final game, pushing a tired backhand into the net on match point. The No. 23-seeded Moya, long known for his Popeye-size right biceps, hit 21 forehand winners to three for Bjorkman, and the disparity helped the Spaniard save 11 of the 14 break points he faced. Like Moya, the No. 6-seeded Djokovic benefited from a lucky bounce on an important point. It came in the tiebreaker, when his backhand kissed the net cord before dropping for a winner. Djokovic crossed himself in gratitude. Verdasco retrieved the ball and put it in his courtside bag, prompting laughter from the crowd. Verdasco shanked a forehand on match point, a fitting finish. The big-swinging Spaniard committed 50 unforced errors. By the middle of the second set, when Djokovic led 4-0, he had a frustrated Verdasco talking to himself. "I was stepping in more, and I was being aggressive," Djokovic said. "I played the best tennis in the important moments." He'll next face Andreev, who had a 19-6 edge in forehand winners against Baghdatis and punctuated his latest victory with a triumphant leap and uppercut. Copyright 2007 Associated Press.

What were the odds that the teenager, Kyoung-Ju Choi, would someday win Jack's own tournament, the Memorial presented by Morgan Stanley, at the Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio? A billion to one? "I can only think that this was meant to be," a beaming Choi said Sunday after he saved par on four of the final five holes, shot a brilliant 65 and won his idol's tournament by one stroke over hard-charging Ryan Moore. K.J. Choi came back from five strokes to win his fifth PGA Tour tournament. Such is the beauty of golf, which has exploded globally since Nicklaus was a young Golden Bear. The possibilities include a Korean boy giving up weightlifting to concentrate on a new sport and 20 years later standing next to his hero, clutching a trophy and a check for $1,080,000. "Definitely, it's very meaningful," Choi said of his fifth victory on the PGA Tour. "It's hard to describe how meaningful it is. I just feel very honored and very happy to be living in the same age, same period, same time as Jack is living." Choi, 37, began the final round on the rain-softened course five strokes behind leader Rod Pampling but ran off four consecutive birdies on Nos. 6-9 to take the lead. On the back nine, seemingly oblivious to the pressure, he made clutch par-saving putts of 4, 7, 15 and 5 feet. "It's my fifth time winning on Tour so I felt very comfortable," he said. "No pressure, really. The fact that it's Jack's tournament made me feel really comfortable." Choi needed a bit of help and he got it from Pampling, who bogeyed No. 17 from behind the green, and Adam Scott, who birdied Nos. 15 and 16 to pull within one but gave both strokes back with bogeys on Nos. 17 and 18. Pampling shot a 72 and tied for third and Scott shot a 70 and tied for fifth. Moore birdied Nos. 13-17 but couldn't make it six in a row on No. 18. He finished at 16-under and waited for Choi. "I felt helpless, for sure," Moore said. "I left it in his hands. I mean, he had control of the tournament. It was up to him and he played well obviously all week and all day … I'm just glad I posted a number and made him have to think about it a little bit." On the par-4 18th, Choi hit his approach into the left greenside bunker, the same one from which Paul Azinger holed out to win the 1993 Memorial. Choi blasted 5 feet past the hole and his par putt caught the ride side of the cup and tumbled in. "That was a very difficult putt," Nicklaus said. Choi's 65 tied the tournament's low final-round score by a winner and he jumped from 36th to eighth place on the FedEx Cup points list. He has the most victories by an Asian-born player on the PGA Tour (followed by Shigeki Maruyama of Japan with three). And it all started when a physical education teacher put a Korean-translated copy of "Golf My Way" into Choi's hands and told him he could succeed as a professional golfer if he studied Nicklaus' swing. "My physical education teacher at that time gave me the book as a present," Choi explained in his post-round news conference. "It just basically showed you how to grip, how to do the backswing and follow-through. Just the very basic fundamentals of golf. That's how I really got into golf is by reading that book." Nicklaus, sitting beside Choi, said: "You're entirely welcome. My pleasure." The status of Phil Mickelson's left wrist will be story going into the U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club next week. Mickelson withdrew after 11 holes in the first round at Muirfield Village. He aggravated a sore left wrist when he hit a wedge shot out of a divot in the 11th fairway. He said he might have initially hurt the wrist last weekend while hitting chip shots out of the deep rough at Oakmont during one of his marathon practice sessions for the Open. It's a tough blow for Mickelson, whose 72nd-hole debacle cost him the 2006 U.S. Open title. He had been on a roll with his victory at The Players following a pair of third-place finishes. He said he hoped to be able to play in the Stanford St. Jude Championship this week. As of Monday morning he was still in the field. Johnny Benjamin, an orthopedic surgeon who has helped NBA star Allen Iverson and boxer Antonio Tarver overcome wrist injuries, said it was possible for Mickelson to be pain-free by the U.S. Open, depending on the severity of the soft-tissue injury. "The treatment usually is rest," Benjamin said. "It may require anti-inflammatories and maybe a cortisone injection. It's certainly likely he could be pain-free by the Open. When you're playing in something at that level and you're playing well, the adrenaline kicks in and the body's natural pain-relieving endorphins actually help ease the pain. It's funny, but if you're playing poorly it actually hurts more." Kenny Perry isn't ready for golf's scrap heap just yet. Perry, who endured a long drought in which he failed to post a top-10 finish in nearly two years, shot a 63 -- the lowest final-round score in the history of the Memorial --- and tied for third place. The 46-year-old golfer with the unorthodox swing missed just two fairways in what he described as a "magical" round. He holed out from the fairway for an eagle on the par-4 sixth and was 6-under after seven holes. "It was just a great day for me," he said. Perry underwent surgery on his right knee on March 13, 2006, and has struggled to regain the form that made him one of the top players on the PGA Tour. From 1987 to 2005, he won nine tournaments, including the Memorial twice, and finished among the top 30 on the money list eight times. "I couldn't make a cut two months ago," he said. "I haven't had a top 10 in almost two years now so ever since the knee surgery and all, I've really gotten behind. My golf swing, I was compensating for it and I really got in a lot of bad habits." In his tune-up for the U.S. Open, Tiger Woods salvaged a tie for 15th place with a 67. However, it was his worst finish at the Memorial since 2002 and he was never a factor in the tournament he won three years in succession (1999-2001). "I feel like I progressed nicely this week, which is what I wanted to do," said Woods, who was headed to Oakmont for a practice round Monday. CBS analyst Nick Faldo had one of the wittiest lines of the week -- and that's tough to do going head-to-head with David Feherty -- during the third round. In the broadcast booth, Nicklaus was asked if he had ever met Elvis Presley and said he hadn't. During the ensuing discussion, it was mentioned that Gary Player claimed to have given golf lessons to Presley. "Elvis probably taught Gary his hip movements, too," Faldo quipped. Mark Wilson posted seven consecutive birdies (Nos. 3-9) in the third round and shot a 29 on the front nine, matching the tournament record set by John Huston in the second round in 1996. The Stanford St. Jude Championship at the 7,244-yard, par-70 TPC Southwind course in Memphis. The final tune-up for the U.S. Open features a strong field including Sergio Garcia, Sean O'Hair, Geoff Ogilvy and Vijay Singh. Woods has finished outside the top 10 in his last two starts.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/2-1&fd=R&url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/scorecard/nbanews.asp%3FarticleID%3D203698&cid=1116547509&ei=iIBkRsmSMY6WrgOdh4DPBQ Skip ads and navigation Monday, June 04, 2007 Keys to victory in the NBA Finals By Warren Blatt, Sports Network NBA Editor (Sports Network) - The San Antonio Spurs are back in the NBA Finals for the fourth time in nine years, while the Cleveland Cavaliers are getting their first taste of the championship round. There is plenty of star power in this best-of-seven series. It took just four years for superstar LeBron James to lead Cleveland to the top of the Eastern Conference. Forward Drew Gooden and center Zydrunas Ilgauskas will need to make an impact down low if the Cavaliers want to keep up with the physical Spurs, while rookie Daniel Gibson has to continue his hot shooting from the outside. The veteran Spurs will not be overwhelmed by the atmosphere of the finals. All-Stars Tim Duncan, who leads the Spurs in scoring (23.2 ppg) and rebounding (11.4 rpg) in the playoffs, and Tony Parker are primed to help the San Antonio franchise earn its fourth championship trophy. Thirty-six-year-old forward Robert Horry, who already has six championship rings, is always ready to knock down the big shot, while Bruce Bowen and Manu Ginobili will do whatever it takes to help their squad win the hardware. San Antonio head coach Gregg Popovich has been the general for all three of the Spurs' championship runs, while Cleveland's Mike Brown, who earned a ring as an assistant with San Antonio in 2003, has guided the Cavaliers to the playoffs in both seasons he has been on their bench. Popovich will try and figure out how to stop James, and Brown must keep his team composed and hope his superstar forward gets a lot of help from his teammates. Both clubs will try and take advantage of any weakness that the opposition reveals. Defensive strategies, matchups, offensive execution and tough, hard- nosed play will have a major impact on this series. CAVALIERS KEYS TO VICTORY -------------------------- 1. HELP LEBRON - Cleveland will not be able to beat the Spurs with a one-man show. As good as the 22-year-old James is, San Antonio is too physical and plays great team defense. The Spurs will try and make LeBron pick up his dribble early and will close the middle when he goes to penetrate. Larry Hughes, Donyell Marshall and Gibson have to step up. If they can hit their shots early from the outside it will open the floor for James and allow the big men to get on track in the low post. The Spurs will have to adjust defensively if LeBron, who is averaging 25.8 points, 8.3 boards and 8.3 assists in the playoffs, gets good support from his teammates. Cleveland's superstar forward will get his points, and if his supporting cast comes through the Cavaliers may have a chance. 2. ILGAUSKAS AND GOODEN HAVE TO SCORE - The Cavaliers need to establish a low- post game if they hope to beat the Spurs in a best-of-seven series. The 7-3 Ilgauskas is averaging 13.8 points and team-best 9.5 rebounds in the postseason, while Gooden has posted 11.1 points and 7.9 boards per game. Ilgauskas and Gooden were solid in the Eastern Conference playoffs, but they need to do more against Duncan and company in the finals. Cleveland won't beat the Spurs four times with threes and 20-foot jumpers. It may work for one game, but not in a long series. The Cavaliers need Ilgauskas and Gooden to make a very high percentage of their shots from around the basket. 3. CONTROL THE BOARDS - Physical play down low is going to be a major factor in this set. Any advantage the Cavaliers can get will be extremely beneficial, and controlling the boards is a great place to start for the Eastern Conference champions. Gooden, Ilgauskas and Anderson Varejao, who is averaging 6.1 rebounds in the postseason, have a tough job ahead of them. They will try to keep San Antonio from getting good looks close to the hoop, and have to keep the Spurs from picking up garbage points off of offensive rebounds. One and done will be the theme of Cleveland's work on the defensive glass, while the Cavaliers will look to push Duncan and the rest of the Spurs big men out so they can grab some offense rebounds which lead to easy points. Outrebounding the Spurs on both ends of the court will be huge for the Cavaliers. SPURS KEYS TO VICTORY ---------------------- 1. MAKE LEBRON EARN HIS POINTS FROM THE OUTSIDE - Team defense is the way to stop James. Every time LeBron has the ball, the Spurs will look to double and even triple team him. Bowen, Michael Finley and Ginobili will all get their chance to matchup with the phenom, and all three will need help as guarding him one-on-one with the way he is playing is simply too much to ask of anyone. Against Detroit in the East finals, LeBron was very effective moving towards the basket. The Spurs need to force him to pick up his dribble and settle for long jumpers. If they can do that, James will have to either dish the ball or take a tough shot. Limiting James' penetration is going to put the pressure on Cleveland's other players. 2. DON'T ALLOW CLEVELAND TO GET OUT IN TRANSITION - Not allowing the Cavaliers to run is a must for San Antonio. Once again, it all comes back to LeBron. If Cleveland is running and getting easy points in transition, that means the Spurs are getting outrebounded and are not playing their brand of basketball. By keeping the East champs from getting out in transition, the Spurs will take away a major part of James' game. Duncan and friends have to control the tempo and make the game a half-court contest. San Antonio has the experience and intelligence to keep the games at its pace. 3. GIVE PARKER ROOM TO CREATE AND WATCH DUNCAN DO HIS THING - Parker, who is averaging 19.8 points and a club-high 6.4 assists in the postseason, should be able to do whatever he wants against Cleveland, while Duncan is playing like a man on a mission and has been a force for the Spurs. Parker's speed is a big asset for San Antonio and will help his teammates get open shots. The 6-2 Parker and Duncan are arguably the top inside-outside combination in the league. Duncan has a soft touch around the basket and from 15-to-18 feet away, while Parker can penetrate, drain the long jumper and has excellent play-making ability. The Cavaliers will have a tough time keeping up with Parker, and the Spurs' point guard could be a shining star in this set. Popovich will game plan offensively around on how Duncan and Parker can exploit Cleveland's defense.

Sports - Baseball - MLB: Wells throws five solid innings in Padres' 7-3 win over Nationals Sun, June 3, 2007 QUOTE OF THE DAY Eligible Canadians for the MLB Draft: Wells throws five solid innings in Padres' 7-3 win over Nationals San Diego Padres' Terrmel Sledge, left, slides home to score on a double hit by Padres' Adrian Gonzalez against Washington Nationals catcher Jesus Flores (3) during the fifth inning, Sunday in Washington. Padres' Marcus Giles (22) looks on. (AP/Nick Wass) WASHINGTON (AP) - David Wells decried the deplorable conditions in which he laboured, while Josh Bard tried to make the best of the wet situation. Wells threw five solid innings in the rain, Bard homered and drove in a career-high four runs and the San Diego Padres beat the Washington Nationals 7-3 on Sunday. "Terrible, terrible and even worse," Wells said when asked to assess the playing conditions as the teams played in persistent precipitation. Had the game been postponed, the best makeup option would have been a Monday afternoon game on what was supposed to be an off-day for the Padres. "We just felt like people wanted to go home. They wanted to be home on the off-day," said Bard, whose team hosts the Los Angeles Dodgers for a three-game series beginning Tuesday. "We're just excited getting out of here taking two of three." Since being suspended three games for his actions in a physical encounter with umpires in Pittsburgh on Thursday - when his apparent home run was reversed and ruled a double - Bard is 5-for-9 with two doubles, a homer and six RBIs. Washington's Austin Kearns had to make a running catch on the warning track in right field on Bard's seventh-inning sacrifice fly, which came with the bases loaded. "He's swinging the bat better," Padres manager Bud Black said. "He would have had a real big game if Kearns hadn't made the play against him." Bard's three-run homer gave the Padres a first-inning lead, and Hiram Bocachica's solo homer - his first hit since being claimed on waivers from Oakland on Thursday - snapped a fifth-inning tie. Wells (3-3) prospered in terrible weather conditions to win for the second time in seven starts. The left-hander allowed three runs on five hits, walked none and struck out two as the Padres won for the seventh time in nine games. Ryan Zimmerman homered for the Nationals, who fell to 6-22 against the Padres since August 2003. Steady, and sometimes heavy, rain eventually turned a drizzle by the seventh inning, as the remnants of tropical storm Barry passed through the mid-Atlantic. Sandbags greeted early arrivals in the dugouts, water collected between first and second bases, and the grounds crew repeatedly spread drying compound on the soggy infield. "You were lucky to have a dry ball at any given time," Wells said. "It was terrible. I'm glad we played, but I don't know why we should. Somebody could have gotten hurt." After Marcus Giles singled, Terrmel Sledge reached on a bunt single when no one covered first and Bard hit a one-out homer to right off Jason Simontacchi's 0-1 pitch for a 3-0 lead. "When you throw into his swing pattern, he's going to hit the ball hard. ... You try to hit your spots, and obviously, down and in isn't a good spot," Simontacchi said. Washington tied it in the third on Zimmerman's homer. Nook Logan singled, went to second on a sacrifice, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Ronnie Belliard's double. Zimmerman then crushed his team-leading eighth home run, a mammoth shot that landed a third of the way up in the left-field upper deck. "They told me where it went. That's pretty far up there, I guess," Zimmerman said. Simontacchi (2-4) retired 12 straight after Bard's homer before Bocachica connected with one out in the fifth. A throwing error by Zimmerman led to two more unearned runs and Simontacchi's departure. Marcus Giles reached on Zimmerman's error and Sledge walked before Adrian Gonzalez extended his hitting streak to 10 games with a two-run double to right for a 6-3 lead. Simontacchi gave up six runs - four earned - on five hits over 4 2-3 innings. He walked one and struck out four. "I thought he pitched decent," Nationals manager Manny Acta said. "He got hurt by the miscues behind him. He made a couple of mistakes, costly ones. He made a couple of mistakes (but) we didn't play well behind him." Notes: OF Mike Cameron was a late scratch from the Padres' lineup because of a tight hamstring. Bocachica took over for Cameron in centre field, while Bard moved into his cleanup spot. Cameron flew out as a pinch-hitter in the ninth. ... The Nationals signed 17-year-old Dominican SS Luis Castillo to a professional contract Sunday. ... San Diego 3B Kevin Kouzmanoff was hit in the right shoulder by a Simontacchi pitch in the fourth, but plate umpire Bob Davidson ruled the pitch a ball because Kouzmanoff didn't try to avoid it. Who is more despised in Major League Baseball?

The starting nose tackle is eligible to participate in the Bears' off-season workout program, training camp and preseason games before the regular-season suspension begins after the team's final preseason game, the NFL said. Commissioner Roger Goodell said he would be prepared to reduce the suspension by two games if Johnson meets certain conditions, including having no further trouble with the law and undergoing counseling. Last December, police raided Johnson's home and found six unregistered firearms -- a violation of his probation on a gun charge stemming from a 2005 arrest after a Chicago nightclub valet reported seeing Johnson with a handgun in his car. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge over that incident. Two days after last winter's police raid, Johnson's bodyguard was shot and killed in an early morning fight while he and Johnson were at a Chicago nightclub. Johnson was suspended by the Bears for one game for being at the club. The 25-year-old Johnson has played in three NFL seasons after attending the University of Washington. Goodell said he would review the matter no later than October 1 to assess Johnson's progress and determine whether the suspension should be reduced. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Novak Djokovic and Igor Andreev also advanced. Nadal won 6-3, 6-1, 7-6 (7-5) today at the lone clay-court major in Paris, a month after Hewitt stretched him to the maximum three sets in the semifinals of the Hamburg Masters. Like top-seed Roger Federer, Nadal hasn&#39;t dropped a set in four matches. ``I played 10 times better today than the last days, no?&#39;&#39; Nadal said in his post-match news conference. ``I am very much in the tournament right now. I&#39;m more confident.&#39;&#39; Nadal, the No. 2 seed from Spain, is trying to become the first man since Bjorn Borg 27 years ago to win three straight titles in Paris. Federer needs the title to complete his Grand Slam collection. The 30-year-old Moya, the 1998 winner, won 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, 7-5 over Jonas Bjorkman to become the oldest man to reach the quarterfinals since Andre Agassi in 2003, when he was 33. Bjorkman, a 35-year-old Swede, was aiming to become the third player his age or older to make the quarterfinals in Paris. ``I&#39;m proud to be the oldest guy left,&#39;&#39; Moya said in his post-match news conference. ``I remember when I was the youngest guy. The time passes so fast, and you don&#39;t realize it.&#39;&#39; Djokovic, the sixth-seeded Serb, defeated Fernando Verdasco of Spain 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1) to secure a spot in the last eight for the second straight year. Serbia&#39;s Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic earlier reached the last eight in the women&#39;s draw. Djokovic next meets Andreev, who beat 2006 Australian Open runner-up Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus 2-6, 6-1, 6-3, 6-4 to reach his first Grand Slam quarterfinal. Andreev began the tournament by eliminating third-seeded Andy Roddick of the U.S. Nadal, who turned 21 yesterday, moved Hewitt, a former No. 1-ranked player and two-time Grand Slam champion, around the baseline and built a 5-1 lead within about 20 minutes. In the first six games, he lost just four points on his serve. Nadal continued to dominate from the back of the court, and Hewitt became so frustrated that at one point when his shot hit the top of the net, he yelled, ``Get over.&#39;&#39; The shot did, though it landed out. In the second set, Nadal went up 3-1, then saved his only break point of the set in the next game. He broke at 5-5 in the third to serve for the match. With the crowd at Philippe Chatrier Court behind him, Hewitt broke Nadal to force the tiebreak and led 4-2. Up 5-4, the Australian&#39;s first serve forced Nadal into a weak return, giving Hewitt a short ball and an open court. Hewitt&#39;s forehand shot found the net. Nadal won the next point at the net and closed it out on another forehand error by Hewitt. ``I went for a little too much,&#39;&#39; Hewitt said. ``But that&#39;s what he makes you do.&#39;&#39; Moya said his friendship with Nadal would be put aside in their quarterfinal. ``Rafa will be a rival,&#39;&#39; he said. ``When you are on the court, you want to win the match, whatever the manner.&#39;&#39; Bjorkman said he knew he would struggle against Moya after their match was scheduled on Suzanne Lenglen Court, not the main one, because it&#39;s slower. Bjorkman was up 5-3 in the opening set before letting the lead slip away and losing in the tie-break, which he led 5-3. ``It was just unfortunate I couldn&#39;t take the first set,&#39;&#39; said Bjorkman, who last reached the fourth round in Paris in 1996. ``At least it would have put some pressure on him.&#39;&#39; Bjorkman, also in the doubles draw, received treatment to his right shoulder to start the third set, when he was broken in the final game. The 20-year-old Djokovic, the youngest player remaining in the draw, beat Verdasco for the first time in three meetings to match his best Grand Slam performance. It was his first match against a player inside the top 120 at Roland Garros this year after beating a qualifier, a player invited as a wild-card entry and a qualifying round loser who made the field when a player dropped out. His previous match, against Frenchman Olivier Patience, went to five sets and lasted five hours. ``Against Olivier it was probably much more difficult because I wasn&#39;t playing my game, and I was playing against 10,000 fans,&#39;&#39; Djokovic said. ``Today I was playing really solid and it showed on court.&#39;&#39; He got the decisive break in the fourth game of the opening set and started the second with another break to cruise to a two-set lead against Verdasco, a left-hander known for his forehand and unpredictability. The third set went with serve to force a tie-break. Djokovic won the first two points and never trailed, virtually clinching it at 3-1 when his backhand hit the top of the net and trickled over. Djokovic apologized, and Verdasco let out a big smile. The match ended on a Verdasco mishit. Baghdatis, playing his first major with a new coach, won the final six games to take the first set. Andreev&#39;s forehand took over, and the unseeded Russian won nine of the next 10 games. One break separated them in the fourth. ``He hurt me quite a lot with his forehand,&#39;&#39; Baghdatis, seeded 16th, said. ``I have a feeling it&#39;s even more powerful than that of Nadal.&#39;&#39; To contact the reporters on this story: James Cone at Roland Garros through the London office at +44- ; Ravi Ubha at Roland Garros through the London office at Last Updated: June 4, 2007 14:23 EDT German Stocks Beat Europe, Emerging Markets, Emulating &#39;60s Earnings Gains DAX Index Slides, Led by E.ON, Deutsche Bank, Siemens; ThyssenKrupp Rises European Stocks Drop, Paced by Banks on Downgrade; Deutsche Bank, BNP Fall

Stoner gets a break to grab pole position Mat Mladin (No. 66) is on route for his sixth win this year as he heads Ben Spies in Saturday's AMA superbike race in Wisconsin. The Doctor makes it six in a row Vermeulen shines on wet track Rossi pans tyres as Vermeulen wins in wet MOTOGP championship leader Casey Stoner made the most of a rain-affected qualifying session to claim pole position for the Italian grand prix run overnight (Melbourne time). The 21-year-old Australian, who has won three of this season's five races, took advantage of a brief respite in the rain to lap the 5.245-kilometre circuit at Mugello in two minutes 0.359 seconds, 1.022 seconds ahead of the Suzuki of compatriot Chris Vermeulen. The sun came out for the last 10 minutes of the session, drying the track and allowing seven-times world champion Valentino Rossi to grab the third place on the front row, 1.336 seconds behind Stoner. Stoner admitted he had not foreseen the deluge that ended rivals' hopes of bettering his time. "I put down the lap that gave me pole, then it seemed to be getting drier, so I came in to get new tyres," he said. "Two minutes later, it poured down. I just crossed my fingers that it would continue. I think at the end, the conditions were almost there for the other riders to beat my lap time, but luckily the track didn't dry out fast enough." Rossi was relieved the rain had stopped long enough for him to avoid starting on the third row of the grid. "It's the worst conditions for qualifying practice. First wet, then dry. At first, I was only eighth (fastest)," said the Italian, who is second in the championship race and aiming to notch up his sixth MotoGP win in six years here. There was no joy, however, for champion Nicky Hayden. The American could manage only 13th on his Honda, nearly four seconds adrift of Stoner. &#9632;Australia's Mat Mladin moved to outright leader of the American Motorcyclist Association series when he defeated Ben Spies on the Lake Elkhart circuit in Wisconsin. Mladin defeated his Yoshimura Suzuki teammate to record his sixth win this season and his fourth in a row. The superbike win was the 57th of Mladin's career. It extended his championship lead over Spies to six points, 276 to 270, after eight of the 19 races. &#9632; Australia's Marcos Ambrose has earned his best NASCAR Busch Series finish with a sixth in the Dover 200 at Dover International Speedway, Delaware, on Saturday. Ambrose drove a superb race in his Ford at the challenging 1.6-kilometre concrete speedway known as "The Monster Mile" to better his previous best finish in the second-tier Busch Series, an eighth on the Mexico City road course. The finish won Ambrose his fourth, and second in succession, rookie of the race award. Ambrose, 30, rose to eighth in the series points standings and is the equal leader of the rookie of the year standings. &#9632; Finland's Marcus Gronholm has avoided major mishaps to maintain his lead in the Acropolis Rally, the eighth round of the 16-race world championship, as Australia's Chris Atkinson slipped from third to sixth. Gronholm was leading by 43.3 seconds from three-time reigning world champion Sebastien Loeb of France and one minute 7.6 seconds in front of Norway's Petter Solberg. Atkinson, who won the event's first two stages, fell from third overnight to be 5:25 behind Gronholm. A puncture and driveshaft failure soured what had been a bright start for the Australian.

Sabean, and it's time to go Better times bring worse traffic U.S. steps over China in exhibition Square field sharpens team Article Launched: 06/03/2007 01:46:12 AM PDT USA soccer beats China, 4-1, at Spartan Stadium in San Jose on June 2 Fresh faces from faraway places Players were missing and the field wasn't wide enough, but the U.S. national soccer team had little problem dismantling China 4-1 Saturday at Spartan Stadium in front of 20,821 fans in its final tuneup for its regional championships. With its Gold Cup opener against Guatemala only five days away, Team USA handed Bob Bradley his fourth victory - and first without an interim tag attached to his title - on goals by DaMarcus Beasley, Benny Feilhaber, Clint Dempsey and Oguchi Onyewu. Missing from Bradley's lineup were the domestically based players whose Major League Soccer teams had games this weekend, including former Earthquakes forward Landon Donovan. But more problematic for the United States was the field. Listed at an already-narrow 70 yards wide but probably closer to being 65, the postage-stamp-sized playing surface allowed China to clog the midfield and disrupt the flow of the game. "Spartan's a hard place to play because it's so narrow," U.S. midfielder Sacha Kljestan said. "It's like an indoor game." But the United States needed only 10 minutes to go ahead, as coach's son Michael Bradley slid a ball behind the Chinese back line to a streaking Beasley, who was tripped in the penalty box by goalkeeper Chen Dong. Beasley buried the resulting penalty kick. But the game that seemed to be on its way to a blowout took a sudden turn. With the Chinese flooding the center and the field too narrow to play the ball down the flanks, the United States lost its rhythm. China started to move forward and tied the score at 1-1 in the 15th minute when Zhang Yaokun hammered in a loose ball near the top of the penalty box. The Chinese nearly went ahead in the 19th minute when captain Shao Jiayi bent a free kick to the left goal post that was pushed out by diving goalkeeper Tim Howard. "If you stop moving as well or if you don't go a good job of moving up your lines, in a five- or 10-minute segment you can step backwards" at Spartan, said Bradley, the coach. But Feilhaber, a 22-year-old midfielder who plays for Hamburg SV of Germany, fired the United States back ahead. Feilhaber ran onto a ball from Sacha Kljestan and flicked it over an onrushing Chen. Zhang tried to clear the bouncing ball but failed to change its trajectory, resulting in a 2-1 lead for the United States. "We allowed them to get back in the game but we reacted well," Onyewu said. Dempsey increased the United States' advantage to 3-1 in the 75th minute by nodding home a corner kick by Feilhaber. The shot was Dempsey's third at point-back range in the half; he blew one-on-ones with Chen in the 65th and 73rd minutes. "I had two good chances I could've put away," Dempsey said. "It was good to the get the monkey off my back." Another header, this one by Onyewu on the end of a free kick by Beasley in the 79th minute, accounted for the final U.S. goal. Whatever problems the field posed, Bob Bradley thought they would benefit his team in the long run. "Any time you play in San Jose on this field, the fact that it's small, it sharpens up a lot of things," he said. Kamani Hill of Berkeley, a 21-year-old forward who plays for Vfl Wolfsburg of Germany, made his international debut as a 74th-minute substitute for Kljestan. Hill's parents and younger brother were in the stands. "I grew up watching games here," Hill said. Also playing in their first games for the United States were Kljestan, forward Charlie Davies and wing Lee Nguyen.

Choi. A fairy-tale ending for Choi As a teen, K.J. Choi studied a Jack Nicklaus instructional book that inspired the South Korean to take golf seriously. (ANDY LYONS/GETTY IMAGES) By Associated Press | Twenty years separated two images of Jack Nicklaus, both meaningful in their own way to K.J. Choi. Nicklaus was the champion who filled every page of a pictorial instruction book that Choi studied religiously as a teenager in South Korea. "As I started reading it, I could understand why he was such a great golfer, because all the things that were written really started to make sense," Choi said. "That's how I really got into golf, by reading the book." Nicklaus was the Memorial tournament host who stood behind the 18th green yesterday afternoon with a proud smile and hearty handshake for Choi, who closed with a 7-under-par 65 for a one-shot victory over Ryan Moore. Indeed, it was a textbook performance. Choi finished off his string of four birdies on the front nine in Dublin, Ohio, with a 7-iron he carved around the trees lining the right side of the ninth fairway into 8 feet. "A cut shot, Jack-style," Choi said with a laugh. Then came a series of pars that were equally significant, all made with clutch putts, en route to his fifth victory on the Tour. "I just feel very honored and very happy to be living in the same time as Jack is living, and to win his tournament is so meaningful to me," Choi said. Rod Pampling had a three-shot lead going into the final round, which was delayed an hour in the morning when rain pounded Muirfield Village. He made a late bid with a 30-foot eagle putt on 16 to get within one shot, then fired his approach on the 17th over the green and into the gallery, taking bogey. He wound up with a 72 and tied for third with Kenny Perry (63). -- Nicole Castrale chased down the world's No. 1 player for her first Tour victory, beating Lorena Ochoa with a par on the first hole of a playoff in the Ginn Tribute in Mount Pleasant, S.C. Castrale closed with a 1-under 71 to match Ochoa (74) at 9-under 279. Ochoa, 0 for 4 in playoffs, was up by six shots Saturday and was still ahead by two shots with three holes to play yesterday. However, bogeys on the 16th and 17th holes dropped the Mexican star into a tie and a wayward tee shot into a marsh on the playoff hole, the 18th, cost her the title. -- Loren Roberts won the Championship in Destin, Fla., for his first victory of the year, closing with a 6-under 65 for a three-stroke victory over Eduardo Romero. Roberts finished with a 16-under 197 total. Romero finished with a 69. -- John Riegger won the LaSalle Bank Open in Glenview, Ill., for his first title, holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the final hole for a 4-under 68 (17-under 271) and a one-stroke victory over B.J. Staten. Brookline's James Driscoll shot 70--276 to fall into a tie for ninth. -- Richard Sterne made a 7-foot putt on the final hole to win the Wales Open in Newport after Bradley Dredge missed a 5-footer that would have forced a playoff. Sterne (65) finished at 13-under 263. Dredge (67), Mardan Mamat (62), Soren Kjeldsen (65) and Mads Vibe-Hastrup (66) were a shot back. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Despite inexperience, U.S. has easy time with China. (Sunday, June 3, 2007) -- A young, inexperienced United States managed a tidy result in defeating an undermanned China 4-1 last night before a good crowd of 20,832 at antiquated Spartan Stadium in San Jose, Calif. The field's narrow width of 70 yards became a major factor in the match. Four different Americans scored with midfielders DaMarcus Beasley and Benny Feilhaber giving the U.S. a 2-1 lead at intermission, followed by goals on headers by midfielder Clint Dempsey and defender Oguchi Onyewu in a four-minute span of the second half. It is significant that three of the four American goals came on dead-ball situations with only Feilhaber recording his first international tally from the run of play. The U.S. intended this match to serve as a tune-up for the Gold Cup which starts for the Americans with a Thursday game against Guatemala at The Home Depot Center. However, when Bob Bradley decided to let most of his Major League Soccer players to remain with their teams for weekend matches, most of his offensive strength was absent. That's why the four-goal outburst was particularly noteworthy. Bradley did have four players from Chivas USA, which had the MLS weekend off. Among them was veteran Ante Razov, who played as a lone striker in what was described as a 4-3-2-1 set. Razov is not even on the Gold Cup roster, but turned in a strong effort despite not showing up on the score-sheet. Razov did have Beasley and Dempsey on his flanks as attacking midfielders. As a result, most of the U.S. attack came with players running out of the midfield either after through balls or ones played over the top. After Zhang Yaokun victimized Sacha Kljestan and then ripped an uncontested shot from 11 yards into the upper left corner for a 1-1 tie in the 15th minute, Bradley immediately shifted to a more standard 4-4-2 formation for better defensive coverage. Because of the field's lack of width, both sides struggled to find room to attack through the crowded midfield. Beasley's goal came on a penalty kick after he was sent through on a nice pass from midfielder Michael Bradley, only to be taken down in the box by keeper Chen Dong. Dempsey's goal was off a corner kick and Onyewu's from a free kick. Only Feilhaber scored without the benefit of a set piece, chipping a shot over the head on an advancing Chen. The fact the U.S. was able to score off dead-ball situations is important because, given the rising crop of American front-liners are generally untested in international competition, making the most of set plays will be important in World Cup qualifying. The U.S. defense was solid, allowing the Chinese few chances. Neither Howard nor Kasey Keller, his second-half replacement, had much to do. The Chinese, missing up to six starters, did not provide much opposition and never seemed to figure out how to play in the narrow confines of Spartan Stadium. They often tried to power the ball through the crowded middle, a strategy that was doomed from the onset. By dropping Dempsey back, Bradley closed the small hole that China exploited for its goal. From that point, the visitors never figured a way through. In a subplot, the boisterous crowd gave San Jose fans hope their government will commit funds to a new soccer stadium which could lead to MLS returning to their city. Goalkeeper Tim Howard - 6: Could not be faulted on the goal and otherwise had little to do. Defender Jonathan Spector - 5.5: Given his experience in England, he still makes some surprising mistakes getting caught upfield when he pushes forward. At times, he is very good, but he must limit errors. Defender Oguchi Onyewu - 6.5: A solid game in the middle and scored a good goal with a perfectly-placed header. Defender Carlos Bocanegra - 6: Almost gave up an early goal after seemingly being surprised by the pace of China's young Manchester United striker Dong Fangzhuo. Then, settled down and played his usual fine match. Defender Jonathan Bornstein - 5: Plays with abandon pushing up from his left-back position, but still makes mistakes. He has all the necessary physical qualities and will only get better with experience. Midfielder Sacha Kljestan - 5: Did very well at times, but much less so at other times. He is young and still learning and that showed in his first cap. Midfielder Michael Bradley - 6: Had a solid match. His game is improving and he will be a major contributor in coming years. Midfielder Benny Feilhaber - 7: Still too early to tell if he's is going to be Claudio Reyna's heir, the one to direct the team out of the midfield., but he did take a step in that direction tonight. He had a solid game at both ends, contributing a good goal and assist. Midfielder Clint Dempsey - 6.5: When he dropped back further into the midfield after China's goal, he changed the complexion of the match. He was solid offensively and defensively, plus he chipped in a nice header for a goal. Midfielder-forward DaMarcus Beasley - 6.5: Befuddled China with his speed. He made good runs into space and opened the scoring with a well-taken penalty kick after he was taken down in the box. Forward Ante Razov - 6.5: A starter because most MLS players were unavailable, he surprised with a strong effort and perhaps made put himself back into consideration for Copa America. Goalkeeper Kasey Keller (46th minute for Howard) - 6: Still a commanding presence in net, he did not have much to do, but organize his defense and cut off any attempt at goal. Forward Charlie Davies (66th minute for Razov) - 5.5: In his international debut, the young striker was not able to use his pace to his advantage, but had a few good touches. He might have done better with the limited number of chances he had. Midfielder Kamani Hill (74th minute for Kljestan) - 6: The U.S. scored twice in the five minutes after he entered the match. In his first international outing, he helped push the pace, resulting in the two dead-ball situations that led to the goals. Defender Frank Simek (74th minute for Spector) - 5.5: He was not asked to do much,. but helped kill off the match after the U.S. built its three-goal lead. Forward Lee Nguyen (80th minute for Beasley) - 5.5: The match was pretty much over by the time he entered, but he shows a few flashes of speed. His first cap was not enough to judge how much he has improved since moving to the Netherlands. Midfielder Jesse Marsch (80th minute for Feilhaber) - 5.5: The veteran is a Bradley favorite and helped close out the match. is SoccerTimes senior correspondent.

Four goals are a welcome sight in any match, and the American defense looked composed for most of the game. Yet with the Gold Cup looming, one question still remains: Has the U.S. attack reached the point at which it can consistently pry open the packed defenses that they will undoubtedly encounter during the month of June? Oguchi Onyewu marked a solid performance with a goal against China. The quartet of goals the Americans scored would seem to answer that query in the affirmative, and if Clint Dempsey had been more clinical in front of goal, the team's final tally would have been even greater. More importantly, there were times when the U.S. midfield played with the requisite speed and touch needed to break down an organized defense, with Benny Feilhaber's goal in the 28th minute a prime example. With the score tied at one, a quick series of passes in midfield preceded Sacha Kljestan's lofted ball that found Feilhaber in the clear, and ended with his deft chip beating both goalkeeper Chen Dong as well as defender Zhang Yaokun. Yet whether Saturday's success will transfer to next Thursday's set-to with Guatemala is far from certain for the simple reason that China put up little resistance. The vast majority of the physical battles went the Americans' way, and I can't think of one Chinese player who stood out, which makes me wonder just what a player like Dong Fangzhuo is doing on the books of a club like Manchester United. (Yes, I get the jersey-sale angle, but still.) There were also times when the U.S. seemed to abandon the quick touches that had opened up the Chinese defense, with the American players showing either too much or too little patience. Those periods -- most notably after DaMarcus Beasley's 10th minute penalty, as well as at the start of the second half -- came at a time when the Chinese were vulnerable. Of course the snug dimensions of Spartan Stadium had something to do with this. Kljestan noted that playing in Spartan is "almost like playing in an indoor game," and no team is going to dominate the opposition for the entire 90 minutes, especially at the international level. Eventually the U.S. put the game away courtesy of two set-piece goals, and given the good spells of play that the American attack had, I'm inclined to give them solid marks. That especially applies to Feilhaber, who not only got involved in the offense, but stepped in with some timely tackles that helped launch some American counterattacks, all of which caught the eye of U.S. head coach Bob Bradley. "Obviously it's tight in the middle of the field but there were still a couple of moments where [Feilhaber's] ability to size up the situation quickly helped him out," said Bradley. "I thought it was a good game for Benny." The same could be said for defender Oguchi Onyewu, who delivered his best national team match in a long while. After a winter of discontent in England, Onyewu was back to his dominating self in the air and capped off his evening with a headed goal from Beasley's free kick. His cohorts in defense did their bit as well, although Bradley will need to smooth out his team's defending on set pieces, which saw China break through for their only goal of the match in the 15th minute. On that occasion, an inability to clear a Chinese free kick allowed the visitors to scramble home an equalizer. As for the Americans' young trio of Charlie Davies, Kamani Hill, and Lee Nguyen, none of them were given enough time to really have much of an impact, although each player gave glimpses of their ability. But for them, this match was all about getting a taste of international soccer, and none were counted on to give a game-changing performance. For their teammates, it's a different story. Much was expected and on this night they delivered. Bradley's challenge now is to achieve that goal while integrating the compliment of MLS players he now has at his disposal. -- Wasn't asked to do much, but did come through in the 18th minute when he touched Shao Jiyai's free kick around the post. Howard had little chance on Zhang's equalizer. -- The Chivas midfielder found it hard to find space on the small field, and he struggled with his distribution a bit more than normal. One terrible giveaway gifted the Chinese a rare chance, but he recovered to force a corner, so no harm done. -- The Fulham defender was solid in defense, although his weak clearing header preceded China's goal. That said, it appeared to be more of a team-wide breakdown (with a hint of luck) than the fault of a single player, and Bocanegra played well otherwise. -- "Gooch" was towering in the middle, and capped of his day with a well-deserved goal. Due to the opponent, it's tough to draw many far-reaching conclusions from this match, but given his struggles earlier in the year with the national team, as well as at Newcastle, this performance should boost his confidence. -- The West Ham defender performed adequately on the right, but he struggled with his touch on a few occasions, and his crosses lacked quality. -- Traded flashes of brilliance with moments of ineptitude, but the good outweighed the bad. Had terrific success with some slashing runs towards the middle of the field, but his touch and finishing seemed off. (Then again, when has his touch ever been "on"?) His delivery on Onyewu's goal was excellent, however. -- Spent the first half struggling with the speed of the game, and always seemed to take one touch too many. He also went to ground on tackles way too often, and needs to pick his spots better in those instances. He did have his good moments however. It was his pass that sprung Beasley for his eventual penalty, and he improved in the second half. -- Another big step in the right direction for the Hamburg midfielder. He seemed to be the first to adapt to the tight spaces, took his goal well and had some well-timed tackles. His pinpoint corner kick on Dempsey's goal makes me hope that we have seen the last of Landon Donovan in that role. -- Considering it was his first international, the Chivas midfielder acquitted himself well, and it was his quick thinking that released Feilhaber for his goal. He'll need to polish his crossing, but a spot on the Copa America roster seems within reach. -- Started out wide, but gradually drifted up top, where he partnered well with Razov. He could have had a hat-trick had he converted all of his chances. He was too in love with the dribble for long stretches. No complaints about his goal though. -- A solid performance from the veteran, who showed good movement and some good touches in leading the American front line. Razov is pretty far down on the U.S. forward depth chart, but he didn't look out of place in this game. -- I can't recall him making one meaningful save. It was a day at the beach for the veteran. -- Showed tremendous pace, and brought the crowd to its feet with one mazy run. But Davies was also pushed off the ball a little bit too easily, making me wonder if his future for both club and country lies out wide. -- Slid comfortably into the right side of defense, and might have helped his cause in his quest to earn a starting role. -- Had one darting run that caught the eye, but otherwise didn't do much. -- Wasn't on long, but showed some flashes of his renowned technical ability. -- With the game already won, Marsch earned his second career cap.

(GREGORY SHAMUS/GETTY IMAGES) By Peter May, Globe Staff | CLEVELAND -- Mike Brown, the coach of the Cavaliers, called the performance "LeBron-esque." He paused for a second and then added, "if that makes sense." Given what he and everyone else had just witnessed Saturday night at Quicken Loans Arena, it made perfect sense. Brown was referring to the 31-point, 6-rebound submission of rookie guard Daniel Gibson. That unforeseen explosion helped the Cavaliers rout the Pistons, 98-82, and take their Eastern Conference final series, four games to two. The victory put the Cavaliers into the NBA Finals for the first time; Game 1 is Thursday night in San Antonio against the vaunted Spurs. Gibson's eruption turned the game around and sent the Pistons reeling back to Michigan, having blown a 2-0 series lead and having dropped four in a row for the first time this season. In a stretch of about 7 1/2 minutes in the third and fourth quarters, Gibson scored 20 points, turning a tight game into a runaway. In the fourth quarter alone, the rookie whose nickname is "Boobie" outscored the Pistons all by himself, 19-16, and had two more baskets ( five) than the entire Pistons' team. As Brown put it, "Daniel Gibson, wow. I was wowing Daniel like I was [wowing] LeBron." While Gibson had had his moments in the series -- he scored 21 points in Game 4 -- his performance in Game 6 was off the charts. The Pistons, overpowered singlehandedly by James in Game 5, vowed to make someone else beat them in Game 6. That someone turned out to be Gibson. The 31 points ranked as the second-highest-scoring game by a Cavalier in the postseason and the highest by any Cav not named LeBron James. There were five 3-pointers (in five attempts) and there were 15 free throw attempts. Gibson is not afraid to put the ball on the floor and take it to the basket, a trait that comes in handy after he's knocked down a trey or two. As his playing time has increased, he has shown an affinity for driving with the ball. In the 2006-07 season, over 60 games, he had 39 free throw attempts. Against the Pistons, in six games, he had 37. And unlike most of his teammates, he makes them. But it will be the 3-point shooting folks will take from Game 6 because it broke the Pistons' backs and led to their total unraveling in the fourth quarter. Gibson scored the final 5 points of the third quarter, helping Cleveland to a 67-66 lead entering the fourth. He then scored 12 of its first 15 points in the fourth (the others coming on a LeBron 3-point play off a steal) and, by that time, the lead was in double figures. Detroit never recovered. The Pistons had forced James to be deferential (3-for-11 shooting, 20 points) and then watched in horror as Gibson dropped trey after trey after trey. "Gibson had a phenomenal series for them," lauded Detroit coach Flip Saunders. "LeBron kills you one game and you don't want to let him get off. Daniel made every big shot." Added the Cavaliers' Larry Hughes, who gallantly played despite plantar fasciitis, "[Gibson] took what the defense was giving him. They were trying to double LeBron. He stepped into some shots and did what he did. Way to step up!" James had scored 48 in Game 5, including the last 25 and 29 of the last 30, an eye-opener of historic proportions. Game 6 was Gibson's jaw-dropper. James said he told the rookie before the game that Gibson was going to get a lot of open shots and that the kid should fire away with impunity. "When a guy tells you that, you step to [the shot] with a lot of confidence and knock it down for him," Gibson said. Gibson averaged 13.5 points a game against the Pistons, all of his 81 points coming in the final five games. This was a far cry from what he did in the first round against Washington (4.3 ppg) and in the next round against the Nets (4.0.) He had more points in Game 6 against Cleveland than he did in all six games against New Jersey (24). Not bad for the 42d overall pick in last year's draft out of the University of Texas, who missed 22 games during the regular season, 15 on the inactive list and 7 more as a DNP-coach's decision. But he has been a playoff fixture in Brown's rotation and that doesn't figure to change when the Finals start. James in all likelihood will continue to draw a crowd (although the Spurs don't like to double-team) and that should give the kid more chances. Based on what he did Saturday night, it may be the ultimate game of pick your poison. Peter May can be reached at P_ &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

K.J. Choi ran off four consecuitve birdies on the front nine to take the lead, then finished with three clutch par saves from the bunkers and gallery to close with a 7-under 65, giving him a one-shot victory over Ryan Moore. MORE FACTS AND FIGURES Choi played the par-4 holes at Muirfield Village during this week&acirc;&not; "!s Memorial presented by Morgan Stanley to a 3.80 average. Since 1983, just two other winners at the Memorial have played the par-4 holes this well. In 1994 Tom Lehman played the par-4&acirc;&not; "!s to a 3.77 average and in 1987 Don Pooley also played them to a 3.80 average. During his victory, K.J. Choi found the fairway in-regulation 83 percent of the time and the green in-regulation 70 percent. In just two of Choi&acirc;&not; "!s previous 210 events on the PGA TOUR has he played to numbers this good in both categories. During his victory at the 2005 Chrysler Classic of Greensboro, Choi found the fairway at a rate of 83 percent and the green 76 percent and at the 2000 Southern Farm Bureau Classic, 83 and 80 percent respectively. Choi carded a double bogey seven on the par-5 563-yard at Muirfield Village during the second round of the Memorial presented by Morgan Stanley. Over the past 25 years, only two winners of the Memorial have carded scores of seven or more on a hole. In the opening round of 1996, Tom Watson recorded a seven on the 11th hole and in the first round in 1990 Greg Norman recorded a seven on the 7th hole. -- Elias Sports Bureau What K.J. Choi did to his fellow competitors Sunday at Muirfield Village Golf Club was something of a blitzkrieg. Five back at the start of a soggy day, Choi fired a closing 7-under-par 65 and steamrolled the field to win his fifth PGA TOUR title at the Memorial Tournament presented by Morgan Stanley. "I won't be your translator, I can tell you that," said tournament founder and host after Choi saved par on four of the final five holes to preserve a one-stroke victory against . "You won't know how it will come out." With a record-tying final-round score first established by in 2002, Choi completed 72 holes at perfectly manicured and effectively defenseless Muirfield Village in 17-under 271 and delivered in plain body language a message that could not be misunderstood. Choi cemented his reputation as a steely competitor -- tank-like, matching his broad build -- and as a proficient scorer all in one timely round that meant more to him that he had cared to let on until the trophy was his. "It's very meaningful. It's hard to describe in words how meaningful it is," said Choi, 37, of South Korea, who has now posted a victory for the third consecutive season. "I just feel very honored and very happy to be living in the same age, same period of time as Jack is living, and to win his tournament is so meaningful to me. I can only think this was meant to be." He can say that because when he was a prep school student, his physical education teacher, seeing potential in young Kyoung-Ju, presented him with a golf instruction book, "Golf My Way," translated into Korean. The author: Jack Nicklaus. "It just basically showed you how to grip, how to do the backswing, the follow through, just a very basic fundamentals of golf," Choi said through his interpretor, Michael Yim. "I followed that and that's how I got into golf is by reading the book. "(My teacher) kept emphasizing that this is a verrrrry famous golfer, so keep reading it. As I started reading it, I could understand why he was such a great golfer because all the things that were written really started to make sense." Lately, he's been honing his game with instructor Steve Bann. Choi was second in fairways hit, and when he missed the greens, which wasn't often, he was able to save par consistently. He led the field in scrambling from 10-30 yards and was third in that category overall. Putting accounts for a large portion of his victory run, too, given that he had to make putts of 4, 7, 15 and 5 feet to save par coming home. Two of those followed tremendous bunker shots. Sandwiched between all that was a two-putt birdie from 33 feet at the 15th that proved to be the difference in holding off Moore, who closed with a 66, and third-place finishers . Perry scorched Muirfield Village for a 63, while Pampling, the third-round leader, treaded water with 72. "He's been building up to this for weeks now," said Choi's caddie, Andy Prodger, who notched his 30th victory in a career that began in 1980 with compatriot . "He was playing very comfortably. Even down the stretch he wasn't really pushing things. He doesn't change. He handles his nerves very well." That hasn't always been the case, at least not consistently. Choi self-given nickname is "Mr. One Foot," because he has a tendency under pressure to hit some shots just a bit short of his target. OK, that happened at 16, but the tank that rolled out to a 30 on the front nine Sunday found a way to close with aplomb. Choi, who is one of the most famous people in his native Korea -- even bigger than Nicklaus, who has been popular in that country for decades -- has put himself firmly in the mix for a berth on the International Team in the Presidents Cup. Choi missed out two years ago, but would relish a chance to play against a U.S. team captained by the Golden Bear. Imada's shot of the day "It's always an honor playing professional golf when a player gets to play in such big tournaments like the Presidents Cup, and I just look very forward to playing against Jack's team again," Choi said. "You know, I worked very hard to win this tournament, and I'm going to keep on grinding so that I do end up making the team." First, there are a few big tournaments to play in, including the U.S. Open at Oakmont, near Pittsburgh, in two weeks. On Sunday, Choi confidently employed a high fade that enabled him to find so many fairways. "Jack style," Choi said himself, beaming. "K.J.," Jack said, advising the 32nd winner of his event, "this (indicating a fade shot with his hand) works very well at Oakmont." Choi smiled again, as if he knew he might have enough in his arsenal. A tank is a hard thing to stop, once it gets rolling. Official PGA TOUR Fantasy Games.

RHP Justin Germano (3-0, 1.08 ERA) Germano has never faced the Nationals RHP Levale Speigner (1-1, 8.39 ERA) Has faced only one Padre, Jose Cruz Jr. (0-for-1) With Clay Hensley optioned to Portland, Germano will be making at least two more starts in this slot. His efforts in his first four starts earned him consideration as the National League Rookie of the Month for May. Rivals are hitting .193 against Germano. In three starts since being promoted out of the bullpen, Speigner has a 14.81 ERA. : 1090-AM, 105.7-FM; 860-AM(Spanish) THE GAME CENTER | HOW THEY LOST (4-3) Compiled by Bill Center Heard it at the game: &#8220;I&#39;ve been around the game long enough to know. I was the odd man out. The A&#39;s had too many outfielders.&#8221; &#8211; Newest Padre Hiram (pronounced E-rahm) Bocachica, on being waived by Oakland in the first ... With one out, Cristian Guzman singled off the top of Jake Peavy&#39;s glove. Ryan Zimmerman doubled into the left-field corner, Guzman sliding home just ahead of the relay from Khalil Greene and Zimmerman taking third. Dmitri Young drove in Guzman with a single to center just beyond the diving reach of second baseman Marcus Giles. in the second ... Mike Cameron opened with a double to right-center and Josh Bard followed with a double to the alley in left-center to make it 2-1 and put the potential tying run at second with none out. But Bard was stranded there. in the third ... Guzman grounded a single to right to open the inning and stole second as Zimmerman struck out. Young singled to center, scoring Guzman. Austin Kearns followed with a double, putting runners at second and third with one out. But Peavy struck out Ryan Church and retired Brian Schneider on a fly to center to limit the damage. in the sixth ... Adrian Gonzalez led off with a double and scored on Bard&#39;s one-out double, his second double of the game. After Russell Branyan walked, Hiram Bocachica popped out against reliever Winston Abreu for the second out. Terrmel Sledge hit a line drive that ticked off Abreu&#39;s glove and ricocheted off the left leg of the second base umpire into short right for a double that scored Bard with the tying run. in the 11th ... Cla Meredith retired the first hitter he faced, Felipe Lopez, on a fly to center. But Guzman dropped a single into left-center and Zimmerman singled to right, sending Guzman to third. Pinch-hitter Ronnie Belliard grounded to the right side, where Giles made the stop but had no play as Guzman scored. BEYOND THE BOX SCORE The problems that have made Jose Cruz Jr. (sneeze-induced back spasms) and Kevin Kousmanoff (sore left instep from a foul ball) day-to-day propositions created some odd matchups for the Padres last night. With former Fallbrook High and Palomar College left-hander Matt Chico starting for the Nationals, the only (partial) right-handed bats remaining on the bench belonged to switch-hitters Geoff Blum and Rob Bowen. So the Padres started the left-handed-hitting Russell Branyan at third base and the left-handed-hitting Terrmel Sledge in left field. Sledge was 0-for-19 with three walks against left-handers this season. Branyan was 1-for-2 with four walks against lefties. Player of the Game: Cristian Guzman went 4-for-5 (including his 1,000th career hit), stole a base and scored three of the Nationals&#39; four runs. : Dmitri Young had four singles to give him eight straight hits, tying the franchise record Andre Dawson set in 1983 for Montreal. : It wasn&#39;t classic Jake Peavy, but it wasn&#39;t bad. In two starts against the Nationals, Peavy has allowed six runs on 16 hits in 14 innings for an ERA of 3.86. Against everyone else, Peavy has a 1.20 ERA. : The Padres had runners on first and second with none out in the fourth when Hiram Bocachica lined out to left fielder Ryan Church, who threw out Josh Bard trying to advance to third after the catch. Then again, it was a baserunning blunder on Bard&#39;s part. Josh Bard: After the Padres had gone hitless in 30 straight at-bats in the No. 5 hole, the catcher is 6-for-10 in his last two games in the slot, with three doubles and two RBI. Four hits last night, including two run-scoring doubles, equals his career high set on Opening Day. Cla Meredith: Since his ERA was 0.00 at the end of April, the reliever has suffered three losses and allowed 11 runs on 26 hits in 12 1/3 innings &#8211; an ERA of 8.03. The middle of the Padres&#39; lineup is heating up. Since Bard moved into the No. 5 slot, the trio of Mike Cameron (5-for-14), Adrian Gonzalez (5-for-13) and Bard (6-for-14) has gone 16-for-41 with 10 doubles and a homer. Jake Peavy&#39;s career record against the Nationals, with a 4.17 ERA. &#8211; Players with four hits last night: Josh Bard of the Padres and Cristian Guzman and Dmitri Young of the Nats. &#8211; Padres&#39; record in extra-inning games. &#8211; Straight times the Padres had beaten the Nationals at RFK Stadium before last night. &#8211; Career hits for Guzman.

By Lonnie White, Times Staff Writer 1:06 PM PDT, June 4, 2007 OTTAWA -- After getting roughed up by Ottawa in Game 3, the Ducks probably wouldn't have needed any more incentive for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals. But they found more anyway with the one-game suspension of defenseman , who will sit out his second game of these playoffs for his hit to the head of Senators forward "I wish I could say that I was surprised with the suspension, but I can't," Ducks forward said. "It's unfortunate, but we're going to use it as motivation. That's something you can never have too much of." With the Senators getting a lift from their crowd on Saturday, the Ducks realize that they have to play with more composure if they want to take a 3-1 lead back to Anaheim for Wednesday's Game 5. "It's going to be a game where everyone is going to have to help, not just the guys who are going to play minutes" in Pronger's place, Ducks center said. "We know that we're going to have to play our best game." told reporters Monday morning that the Ducks have been down this road before. "It's a piece of adversity that we've talked about &#91;how&#93; we've dealt with it historically," Carlyle said, referring to an early season stretch when because of various injuries, the Ducks played without goaltender "Key players out of our lineup for almost up to the All Star break. And those are the things that your team learns in the regular season, but, obviously, in the playoffs, it's a little different." McAmmond, who did not return after suffering a head injury as a result of Pronger's hit, skated with his teammates Monday morning and will be a game-time decision. "I actually feel pretty good considering," said McAmmond, who took a shot to the chin courtesy of Pronger. "As far as if I'm going to play tonight, I'm just going to continue on with my day and see how I feel later." said he's not sure whether McAmmond will be ready. "Obviously, we have to talk to the doctors before we let him play, but he's trying," Murray said. "He'd like to play. But in talking to him, he's certainly not 100% at this moment." McAmmond, a key player on the Senators' speed line and penalty kill who scored his first goal of the finals in Game 3, said he's not going to force himself into the lineup if he doesn't feel right. "The headache seems to be going away," McAmmond said. "The neck seems to be loosening up with movement. That's pretty good, but there's other things, too. Just sometimes, if you ever got clunked in the head, you go along, some things you just know aren't right. "If I get out on the ice and I don't feel quite right, then I don't feel like I should be in a situation trying to help this team win. If I'm out there killing a penalty and I don't feel confident that I can compete 100%, then I would not put myself in that situation, or the team. "Again, if I feel confident that I can compete at 100%, then I think everything is a go." That would not shock Carlyle, who said: "Nothing would surprise me. It's playoffs. It's what happens. People make huge strides in their recovery after suspensions. It's amazing." Carlyle also talked about Ducks winger , who suffered an abdominal bruise in a collision in Game 3. "You never risk a player's health or well-being," Carlyle said of Kunitz, who had just returned after sitting out seven games with a broken hand. "Every player will tell you he's ready. This is the Stanley Cup final. Sometimes you have to make a decision that the player doesn't agree with but you don't want to jeopardize a player's chances to come back at a later date." If Kunitz does not play, rookie , who played the first two games of the finals, is expected to take his spot in the lineup.

And as you were perusing that photo, he was already thinking about playing Game 4 of the Stanley Cup playoffs last night. Senators coach Bryan Murray said it would be a doctor's decision first, and then a coach's game-time decision if he were to be cleared medically. Email to a friend "Nothing would surprise me," Anaheim Ducks coach Randy Carlyle said, when he heard the news. "It's playoffs. It's what happens. People make huge strides in their recovery after suspensions. It's amazing." McAmmond, whose head was emptied of all thought or sense of time and place by Chris Pronger's elbow in the third period of Game 3 - a crime for which the Anaheim defenceman was handed a one-game suspension - made the victim's statement of impact Monday morning, and his words brought home how frighteningly close every NHL player is to having his career derailed or ended in a moment of recklessness by an opposing player. "It's different having a head injury like this," said the 34-year-old journeyman from Grande Cache, Alta. "I got knocked out in Calgary a few years ago. At that time, it was like a mandatory seven-day period of rest that you had to have if you lost consciousness." That was then. This is playoffs. As NHL general managers met in a nearby hotel, with the subject of head blows on the agenda, the length of Pronger's suspension, his second in three weeks, was kicked around a good deal by both teams. "I think when you have an elbow, a punch, something that really puts a guy in jeopardy, I think we have to address that," said Sens coach Bryan Murray. "And the player in all likelihood should be eliminated from the game immediately - five and a game, and then the hockey department rule, whether it be a one-game suspension, they have to determine the seriousness of it. And maybe the whole issue was if the [victim] is out for five games, [the perpetrator] sits five games. I don't know if that's the solution or not, but it's a thought." McAmmond doesn't remember the second intermission of Game 3 or the events leading up to the hit. He does remember when a teammate in Calgary, Matthew Lombardi, took a Derian Hatcher elbow in the head during the 2004 playoffs and had to go through 11 months of forced inactivity with post-concussion syndrome. "I think he was still having repercussions of it when I saw him in the minors almost a year later," said McAmmond. "There was no suspension, and again, same type of incident." But McAmmond doesn't think the length of the suspension should be tied to the amount of time the victim is out. "It depends on the person, how they react to the incident," he said. "I think you should kind of look at the hit and judge it by the flagrancy there, and not matter if the guy is up the next minute or a whole year. In my opinion, just go by the foul or the incident alone, and make it strict enough that it will keep guys from raising their elbows. "I know [with the new rules on] hooking and holding, sometimes I don't even want to bring my stick on the ice it's called so much. So we'll see how that helps." McAmmond rode the stationary bike for several minutes Monday morning and skated lightly. "I didn't have as much discomfort. But because of the kind of the whiplash, I have a lot of stiffness in my neck and whatnot. So it's kind of tough to differentiate the pain."

PyattÂ had a career-best 23 goals and 14 assists in 76 games for Vancouver and was set toÂ become an unrestricted free agent this summer. Reports of an imminent deal first surfaced late last week. Taylor Pyatt had a career year with the Canucks in 2006-07, scoring 23 goals and 14 assists. The Thunder Bay, Ont., native also had two goals and four assists in 12 playoff games, including a key overtime winner in Game 3 of the opening round against Dallas. Pyatt's extension is worth over $3 million US. The forward made $700,000Â during the past season.Â  The Canucks acquired the six-foot-four, 220-pound Pyatt from the Buffalo Sabres last year for a fourth-round pick in the upcoming draft in June. Pyatt played junior hockey with the Subdury Wolves and was selected eighth overall in the 1999 NHL entry draft by the New York Islanders. After one season in Long Island, he and Tim Connolly were sent to theÂ Sabres in 2001 for Michael Peca. Pyatt has recorded 65 goals and 70 assists in 384 career NHL games.

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19033997/&cid Giants 8, Phillies 1 - Wire Services - Baseball - MSNBC.com Giants 8, Phillies 1 By By ROB MAADDI PHILADELPHIA (AP) -Barry Zito allowed only an unearned run over six innings and Ryan Klesko hit a three-run homer to lead the San Francisco Giants over the Philadelphia Phillies 8-1 Monday. Zito (6-5) pitched out of trouble throughout the afternoon to win his third straight start. Barry Bonds was 0-for-4 with two strikeouts and a walk to remain at 746 career homers, 10 shy of breaking Hank Aaron's record. After homering 11 times in his first 76 at-bats, the Giants slugger has only one home run in 61 at-bats since connecting May 8. Ray Durham hit a two-run shot and Randy Winn, Bengie Molina and Kevin Frandsen each had three hits for the Giants, who have won just three of their last 10 games. Zito allowed six hits, walked four and struck out five. The left-hander has an 0.45 ERA in his last three outings after giving up 13 runs combined in consecutive starts. Jon Lieber (2-4) allowed five runs and 10 hits in five-plus innings. He's allowed 14 runs and 29 hits in three starts after posting a 2.50 ERA in his first six. The Phillies had plenty of chances against Zito, but couldn't get a clutch hit. They were 1-for-14 with runners in scoring position and stranded 12 runners. Philadelphia lost five of seven on its homestand after sweeping a three-game series in Atlanta to move a season-best two games over .500. The Phillies are eight games behind the NL East-leading Mets going into a three-game series in New York. The Giants scored five runs off Lieber with two outs in the fifth to take a 5-0 lead. Frandsen led off the inning with a single and Winn had an infield single that put runners at the corners with one out. Fred Lewis followed with a grounder to first baseman Ryan Howard, who was a few feet off the bag. Instead of going to second and trying for an inning-ending double play, Howard hesitated before throwing home to get Frandsen. Klesko hit the next pitch off a billboard on the facing of the second deck in right field to give the Giants a 3-0 lead. A high follow-through on his swing made Klesko's bat flip look exaggerated as he admired his second homer of the season. The Phillies didn't appear to be offended. Bonds followed with a walk, Durham doubled and Molina was intentionally walked to load the bases. Pedro Feliz drove in a run with a single to right and Frandsen's infield single to third made it 5-0. The Phillies had a chance for a big inning in the bottom of the fifth, but only produced a run. Singles by Jimmy Rollins and Chase Utley sandwiched around second baseman Durham's error on Shane Victorino's grounder loaded the bases. But Howard flied out to shallow left. After Rollins scored on Jayson Werth's groundout to cut it to 5-1, Aaron Rowand fouled out to end the inning. With the bases loaded and one out in the first, Werth popped out to shallow right and Rowand hit a bouncer to Zito to end the inning. After the first two batters reached in the third, Utley struck out looking, Howard fanned swinging and Werth flied out. The Phillies again put runners on first and second with no outs in the sixth, but pinch-hitter Pat Burrell, Rollins and Victorino all grounded out. Notes: Giants RHP Russ Ortiz pitched two-thirds of an inning, before leaving with an apparent injury in the eighth. ... The Phillies are 6-15 against left-handed starters. ... Klesko is batting .405 (17-for-42) with five homers and 18 RBIs lifetime against Lieber. ... Zito is 89-4 when he receives four runs or more. Â© 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19002603/&cid Just another sorry chapter for reeling Cubs - Baseball - MSNBC.com Just another sorry chapter for reeling Cubs Dugout scuffle, losing skid, Piniellaâ€™s rant made for tough week in Chicago Tannen Maury / EPA Cubs pitcher Carlos Zambrano, right, is restrained by pitching coach Larry Rothschild and infielder Derrek Lee during an argument with Cubs catcher Michael Barrett on Friday. The Cubs have lost six straight. CHICAGO - These are crazy days for the Chicago Cubs, who have known a lot of them in their long, anguished history. Carlos Zambrano and Michael Barrett are fighting in the dugout. The team is breaking down on the field. And manager Lou Piniella is steaming, disgusted with a group that he insists does not play like major leaguers. Heâ€™s also kicking dirt on umpires, throwing his cap and getting ejected â€” an outburst that came during Saturdayâ€™s 5-3 defeat to Atlanta for the Cubsâ€™ sixth straight loss. And thatâ€™s just the past week. This descent into mayhem was hardly envisioned after the club committed about $300 million during the offseason to build a winner. â€œI am fed up with some of the play weâ€™ve had on the field,â€ Piniella said. He did, however, have a request: â€œI hope I donâ€™t get judged by my start. Just give me time to get this thing straightened out.â€ That will pose a challenge. At the moment, the Cubs are a mess. Everything came to a head Friday, when Barrett went to the hospital, needing six stitches after his fight with Zambrano. The trouble in the dugout was compounded by trouble on the field: The Cubs lost 8-5. â€œSomethingâ€™s got to change,â€ Aramis Ramirez said. Derrek Lee said itâ€™s up to the players to make those changes. â€œItâ€™s on us, not management,â€ he said. â€œWeâ€™ve been talked to over and over. Weâ€™ve talked among ourselves. Itâ€™s just time to do it.â€ Things got ugly between Zambrano and Barrett in the fifth inning when the Braves scored five runs. One came on a passed ball and throwing error by Barrett, and he and Zambrano got into a shouting match in the dugout before the bottom half. Zambrano screamed and pointed toward his head as he approached Barrett, who gestured toward the field while yelling at him. The pitcher shoved Barrett and slapped him. He had his right fist cocked as the two were separated. Piniella and several players led Zambrano back to the clubhouse and the manager told him to shower and leave. Piniella then returned to the dugout. Barrett went back to the clubhouse, and Round 2 was under way. This one left him with a split lip and bruise below the left eye. Piniellaâ€™s temper came to a slow boil later when someone asked about his frustration. It ended with him shouting: â€œI only have so many players that I can play! You know? And itâ€™s about time some of them start playing like major leaguers! Or, get somebody else in here that can catch the damn ball or run the bases properly! All right? Thatâ€™s all I can say!â€ He left the room, uttering an obscenity along the way. And he was still riled up on Saturday. Piniella said he and management are on the same page, but this clearly has been a difficult season. â€œSome of the things Iâ€™ve seen here, I havenâ€™t seen anywhere else Iâ€™ve been,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m not fed up with it, but itâ€™s got to stop. Or, obviously, weâ€™ve got to make some changes.â€ The frustration for the Cubs â€” who have not appeared in a World Series since 1945 â€” has been percolating all season. This was a year they thought they were playoff contenders after a 66-win season. Andy MacPhail resigned as president at the end of the season, and the Cubs decided not to renew former manager Dusty Bakerâ€™s contract. General manager Jim Hendry got the equivalent of a blank check from ownership and went shopping. ALSO ON THIS STORY Cubs lose 6th straight, Piniella tossed Zambrano takes blame for dugout scuffle Discuss: Sound off on our baseball message boards He hired Piniella. He re-signed Ramirez for five years and $75 million. Then, he reeled in the big catch of the offseason â€” Alfonso Soriano, for $136 million over eight years. And Hendry wasnâ€™t finished.

If Johnson complies with the terms of his suspension and otherwise stays out of trouble, he will be eligible to have his penalty reduced to six games, the NFL said. Click to enlarge image The NFL suspended Tank Johnson on Monday for the first eight games of the 2007 season. Jail not healthy for Tank Tank free, but may face punishment Tank: I'm guilty and I'm sorry Tank in the clink "It's an opportunity for me to move forward," Johnson said when asked about the punishment. "It's not for me to say whether it's fair or not. "My focus is just getting through it, making sure my body's fresh when it's time to play football. "It's time for a new beginning." If Johnson misses eight games, his first game back will be Nov. 11 at Oakland. If he only misses six games, he would return Oct. 21 at Philadelphia. Johnson will be allowed to participate in all team activities, including training camp and preseason games, before he begins his suspension at the start of the regular season. Johnson is the third player suspended by Goodell this offseason for off-field behavior. In April, Goodell suspended Tennessee Titans defensive back Adam ‘‘Pacman’’ Jones for the entire 2007 season and Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry for eight games.

http://www.autoracingdaily.com/article/suzukis_ben_spies_wins_his_first_ever_road_america_ama_superbike_race/&cid Auto Racing Daily : Suzuki&#8217;s Ben Spies Wins His First-ever Road America AMA Superbike Race Suzuki&#8217;s Ben Spies Wins His First-ever Road America AMA Superbike Race Sports Car Club of America Champ Car World Series Suzuki&#8217;s Ben Spies Wins His First-ever Road America AMA Superbike Race Despite inclement weather, Yoshimura Suzuki&#8217;s Ben Spies won his first-ever Road America AMA Superbike race in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin on Sunday afternoon. This victory is Spies&#8217; third win of the season and moves the defending AMA Superbike Champion into the lead in the AMA Superbike Championship points chase. Team mate Mat Mladin finished an impressive third in the wet race, while Tommy Hayden, unfortunately, crashed and was unable to finish. &#8220;I have to thank my Yoshimura Suzuki team for doing such a great job, staying up until 1:00 in the morning to rebuild the bike I crashed in practice yesterday, &#8220; said Spies. &#8220;My Suzuki GSX-R1000 was so good in the rain today. I was afraid the track was going to dry out. We needed this win, for sure. &#8220; The 16-lap race went off as scheduled in spite of the rain and Spies got the holeshot. By lap two, Hayden was running in third and Mladin was in seventh. As the storm grew worse, however, the race was red flagged because of conditions. When the storm subsided into merely rain, the complete restart saw Jordan Suzuki&#8217;s Aaron Yates get the holeshot but he was overtaken by Mladin and Spies on the first lap. Mladin, who started from pole position, led briefly before being passed by Spies. Spies took over the lead and created a gap and took the win. &#8220;In the first start, I got a pretty good holeshot but I was still feeling it out and not going all out, &#8220; said Spies. &#8220;Then we had the red flag and in the second start I followed Mat and then got around him. I just tried to put some decent laps together and get as big a gap as I could. Then, I just put it on cruise control&#226;&#8364;&#166; I&#8217;ve been riding hard all year and trying to not make mistakes. We know we have to win races to win the championship. Now, we just need to take it to a new level and not ride so conservatively. &#8220; Mladin, meanwhile, settled into second position before being passed midway through the race. The six-time AMA Superbike Champion played it safe, however, and rode his Yoshimura Suzuki GSX-R1000 to the third podium spot. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t get a good start in the first start, &#8220; said Mladin. &#8220;There was so much water that I couldn&#8217;t see where I was going. I&#8217;d already made the decision to not do anything crazy. The conditions in the second start were more sane. It was slippery, but visibility was ok. (As for Jamie and Ben), they just rode better than me. In the race, I saw some things I could improve on. I am lacking in the rain in some areas. But some of the things that hurt me in the rain help me in the dry. And fortunately, most races are on sunny days. &#8220; Former AMA Supersport Champion Hayden got off the line and was in third place in the first start. In the second start, he&#8217;d moved into position to battle for a podium spot when he went down and was unable to finish. &#8220;I made a mistake in Turn One, &#8220; said Hayden, who wasn&#8217;t injured in the get-off. &#8220;Up until then, the race was going good and I felt really comfortable on the Yoshimura Suzuki GSX-R1000. I&#8217;d caught the battle for second place and then I locked up the front brake. I was down on the ground before I could do anything about it. &#8220; AMA Superbike Top 10 Finishers: 1 Ben Spies (Yoshimura Suzuki) 2 Jamie Hacking (Kawasaki) 3 Mat Mladin (Yoshimura Suzuki) 4 Aaron Yates (Jordan Suzuki) 5 James Ellison (Honda) 6 Jake Zemke, Honda 7 Jake Holden (Jordan Suzuki) 8 John Haner (Suzuki) 9 Eric Bostrom (Yamaha) 10 Dominic Jones (Honda) Page 1 of 1 pages for this article Comments on "Suzuki&#8217;s Ben Spies Wins His First-ever Road America AMA Superbike Race" You must be a member to post a comment.

Sabean, and it's time to go Better times bring worse traffic Column: Will King James be coronated? By JIM LITKE AP Sports Columnist Article Launched: 06/04/2007 12:49:19 AM PDT Click photo to enlarge Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James hoists the trophy after the Cavaliers beat the Detroit Pistons, 98-82, to win the NBA Eastern Conference championship Saturday, June 2, 2007, in Cleveland. Four years after skipping college for the pros, James completed his degree in superstardom with four straight clutch performances over the Detroit Pistons to earn the Cavaliers their first trip to the NBA finals. Four days later, people are still debating where LeBron James' 25 straight points to end Game 5 ranks on the NBA's list of all-time best finishes. The only point worth adding is this: Whoever has James' ear between now and Thursday can serve the King best by reminding him that better be just the beginning. James better have a few more games like that in him, and we're not talking during the course of his career, but over the next two weeks. Otherwise, this will be remembered as the NBA finals that he got close enough to see his reflection in the Larry O'Brien Trophy&mdash;and not much else. It's easy to forget how tricky it can be for even the brightest young star to trace a learning curve that reaches the top without a single dip, maybe because Miami's Dwyane Wade did it only last year. James, to his credit, didn't need reminding. He recently described climbing over the Pistons and out of the Eastern Conference in just his second try as "another chapter in my book, I guess." But James also understands he won't write that happy ending without help. The tough part will be deciding how much to accept. "If I get double-teamed and the game is close, I'm going to pass it again," James said, despite catching flak for doing just that at the start of the Detroit series. "If we make the shot, I'm on top of the world. If not, then I'm under a lot of trees and leaves. It's fine with me. I'll take the criticism that comes with it. There's a nice bit of symmetry in having the Spurs stand between James and that shiny piece of hardware he wants so much. The Cavaliers have modeled themselves as the Spurs of the East, and two of their chief decision-makers, coach Mike Brown and GM Danny Ferry, actually did their management training in San Antonio. But the sharing arrangement, not to mention a real resemblance, pretty much ends there. The only coronation the Spurs plan on attending anytime soon is their own. They can grab their fourth championship since 1999, a run of titles that might finally garner San Antonio and reluctant superstar Tim Duncan the respect and recognition that has so far consistently lagged behind their accomplishments. The Spurs last appearance in the finals, against Detroit in 2005, was almost the opposite situation from what James and the Cavs will be facing this time around. It was framed as a referendum on whether Duncan was truly a great player, or just a very good one lucky enough to land in San Antonio when the Spurs boasted a deep and better-than-average supporting cast. As that series stretched out toward Game 7, the NBA's promotional tagline for the series, "Where Legends Are Born," began to sound like a dare. Duncan responded with 25 points, 11 rebounds, two blocks and three assists. Nearly all the numbers flowed easily from the Spurs game plan, except for a stretch late in the third quarter when Duncan scored nearly half his total and grabbed the game by the throat. In a hallway afterward, former teammate David Robinson savored the win and that third-quarter as much as any of Duncan's then-teammates. "Some people talked about Tim like a dog. The way that man has performed over the years, I don't understand that," said Robinson, who partnered Duncan for two of San Antonio's titles. "For him to dig down tonight and show everybody what he's made of is just awesome, unbelievable. He settled it the best way." Unfortunately, James doesn't have Robinson, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker or even Robert Horry to take over the show long enough to catch his breath. And unlike Wade, Shaquille O'Neal won't be there to cover his back. If James is going to win a championship this year, he's going to have to do it the same way he just sent Detroit packing: largely on his own. The 25 points in a row that closed out Game 5 was part of a 48-point night that got most of the attention. But James' performances on either side of that game were almost as good. He averaged 33 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists. James can't afford much slippage if Cleveland is going to have a chance. So Spurs coach Gregg Popovich wasn't exaggerating when he said, "Pick a problem, we have it, with LeBron. He's fantastic in every way so, pick any aspect of the game, he's a problem." But more telling was something that Duncan said a little later. "You have to respect someone like that and focus a little more of the attention toward him. "But they're going to need a team to beat us," he added, "LeBron's not going to do it by himself." Jim Litke is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7007542686&cid AHN | Denver Signs DT Sam Adams, Vet Solidifies Defensive Line | June 4, 2007 global news for the digital world Denver Signs DT Sam Adams, Vet Solidifies Defensive Line June 4, 2007 3:01 p.m. EST Matt Aug - AHN Sports Writer Denver, CO (AHN) - Sam Adams will put some "crush" back into the Denver Broncos defensive line this season. Denver has signed the veteran tackle to a one-year deal in order to shore up the team's run defense. Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed on the signing of the 33-year-old, who was released earlier this week by the Cincinnati Bengals. The remarkably durable player started in all 16 games for the Bengals in 2006, recording a pair of sacks. The 14-year veteran was an impressive run-stopper for a team that went 8-8 last season and is perhaps looking to get younger under coach Marvin Lewis. Adams, who has played in 195 games in his career with 166 starts, has registered 452 tackles, 44 sacks and six forced fumbles in stops that included Seattle, Baltimore, Oakland and Buffalo. Despite the Bengals concern about his age, Adams has been virtually injury free in his career, missing just 13 games. His immense size, 6-foot-3, 350 pounds, makes him a force to be reckoned with on the line and is very difficult to move out of position when teams try to run his direction.

Choi was 16 years old, his high school physical education teacher in South Korea gave him a now-priceless gift. It was a pictorial instruction book by Jack Nicklaus, probably The teacher told Choi he might find a good future as a professional in the sport and directed him to faithfully follow Nicklaus' teachings. ``My teacher kept emphasizing, `This is a book written by a very famous golfer, so keep reading it,' '' Choi said. ``As I started, I could understand why he was such a great golfer because all the things really started to make sense.'' Twenty-one years later, Choi got an opportunity to say, ``Thank you, Jack'' for the book that inspired his career. Choi fired a 7-under-par 65 Sunday at Muirfield Village Golf Club and his 17-under 271 total earned him a 1-stroke victory over Ryan Moore in the Memorial Tournament founded by Nicklaus. The famous author responded: ``You're entirely welcome. My pleasure.'' Choi, 37, used his masterful putting to record the biggest victory of his five on the PGA Tour. He birdied six holes on the front nine to grab the lead, added another birdie at No. 11, survived his only hiccup, a bogey at No. 13, and got that stroke back at the par-5 15th when he two-putted from 30 feet. But the key to claiming the $1.08 million first-place prize were his par-saves, including a 5-foot putt on No. 18 after he landed in the greenside ``Azinger'' bunker. He made six one-putts on the back nine, five to save par. ``It's hard to describe in words how meaningful it is,'' Choi said through an interpreter, Michael Yim. ``I feel very honored and very happy to be living in the same time as Jack and to win his tournament. I can only think that this was meant to be. God planned all this to happen and I just want to thank God for today.'' Two-time Memorial winner Kenny Perry returned to his 2003 form after months of misery with the day's low round of 63 and tied for third with Australia's Rod Pampling. Pampling, who started the day with a 3-stroke lead over Sean O'Hair and Adam Scott, got nothing going on the front nine and shot 72. His best opportunity came at the par-3 8th, where he stuck his tee shot within four feet of the pin, but he read a big break on the putt and missed. But he and Scott still trailed Choi by 1 shot when they came to 17. Both bogeyed, ending the drama. Pampling's second shot was long over the green and he found his ball in matted rough. Scott's second shot landed on the fringe of the green, well short of the pin. Moore (66), a four-time All-American at UNLV, shot a 31 on the back nine, including five consecutive birdies, and matched his best PGA Tour finish. Scott (70) tied for fifth at 14 under with Stewart Cink (69), Fredrik Jacobson (68) and Sean O'Hair (70). Three-time Memorial champion Tiger Woods turned in his low round of the tournament with a 5-under 67 and tied for 15th at 9 under. He said it was good preparation for the U.S. Open, which begins at Oakmont on June 14. ``I feel like I've progressed nicely this week,'' Woods said. ``Today I hit so many good putts. I drove it really well, started placing the ball on the correct side of the fairways and giving myself the angles I wanted into the greens.'' In 1999, Choi became the first Korean to earn a PGA Tour card and played in his first Memorial Tournament. At the trophy presentation, Choi and Nicklaus recalled playing together in the third round that year. Choi shot 76, but still valued the experience and ended up finishing tied for 24th. ``The night before I played with him, I was nervous, just the thought of playing with this legend,'' Choi said. ``But he gave me a lot of advice. He treated me like his son and I was able to become more comfortable during the round.'' Choi said it was about three years after he first read Nicklaus' book that he realized he might have a future as a professional golfer. He said it was two years before he acquired another Nicklaus offering. But Choi didn't break par until he was 21. He turned pro at 24. On Sunday, Choi reveled in the presence of Nicklaus, referring to his 5-yard high cut shot as ``Jack style.'' Nicklaus won his first of 18 professional majors at the U.S. Open at Oakmont in 1962 and knows plenty about the legendary Pennsylvania layout. He predicted Choi could be a factor there. ``K.J., this works very well at Oakmont,'' Nicklaus said, tracking Choi's fade with his hand. ``K.J. is a high-ball hitter, a left-to-right player and I think it favors both of those.'' Few knew if Choi understood what Nicklaus said. But Nicklaus could have provided Choi's inspiration once again.

Castrale chased down the world's No. 1 player, beating Lorena Ochoa with a par on the first playoff hole yesterday at the Ginn Tribute in Mount Pleasant, S.C. For her part, Castrale was well aware of her accomplishment. &#34;To beat Lorena, yeah, the odds weren't on my side,&#34; Castrale said. Castrale was six shots behind Ochoa with six holes left in Saturday's third round. But never did she think her breakthrough was out of reach. &#34;Never did I think I couldn't catch her,&#34; Castrale said. &#34;I knew I was playing well, too.&#34; Castrale continued that confidence yesterday. She closed with a one-under 71 to match Ochoa (74) at nine-under 279, then calmly made par after Ochoa drove her ball left in a marsh on the extra hole. She had never done better than a tie for third in last season's Honda LPGA Thailand event. The loss dropped Ochoa to 0-4 in playoffs. &#34;I need to learn to win in the tough ones,&#34; she said. Cristie Kerr closed with a 73 to finish third at six under, and Paula Creamer (71) and Sarah Lee (71) tied for fourth at five under. Annika Sorenstam, the tourney host, struggled to her highest round of the week, four-over 76, and tied for 36th. She hadn't played in two months as she recovered from a ruptured disk and bulging disk. Alena Sharp of Hamilton shot a four-over 74. She earned $9,645 (U.S.) for finishing in a tie for 45th at six over. PGA: Twenty years separated two images of Jack Nicklaus, both meaningful in their own way to K.J. Choi. Nicklaus was the champion who filled every page of a pictorial instruction book that Choi studied religiously as a teenager in South Korea, a gift from a physical education teacher who encouraged him to pursue a career in golf. &#34;As I started reading it, I could understand why Jack was such a great golfer, because all the things that were written really started to make sense,&#34; Choi said. &#34;That's how I really got into golf, by reading that book.&#34; Nicklaus was the tournament host at the Memorial who stood behind the 18th green yesterday with a proud smile and hearty handshake for Choi, who closed with a seven-under 65 for a one-shot victory over Ryan Moore in Dublin, Ohio. &#34;Thank you, Jack,&#34; Choi said to him. Rod Pampling had a three-shot lead going into the final round but wound up with a 72 and tied for third with Kenny Perry, who shot 63 and was among half-dozen players in a wild chase to the finish. EUROPEAN: Richard Sterne of South Africa made a seven-foot putt on the final hole to win the Wales Open after Bradley Dredge missed a five-footer that would have forced a playoff. Dredge birdied the 15th, 16th and 17th holes to be on the verge of becoming the first Welshman to win the tournament in its eight-year history, but he bogeyed the last after driving into a bunker. CHAMPIONS: Loren Roberts won The Boeing Championship for his first Champions Tour title of the year, closing with a six-under 65 for a three-stroke victory over Eduardo Romero in Destin, Fla. Niagara Falls' Rod Spittle (71) finished in a tie for 29th at three under. NATIONWIDE: John Riegger won the LaSalle Bank Open in Illinois yesterday for his first Nationwide Tour title, holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the final hole for a four-under 68 and a one-stroke victory over B.J.

Wells threw five solid innings in the rain, Bard homered and drove in a career-high four runs and the San Diego Padres beat the Washington Nationals 7-3 on Sunday. "Terrible, terrible and even worse," Wells said when asked to assess the playing conditions as the teams played in persistent precipitation. Had the game been postponed, the best makeup option would have been a Monday afternoon game on what was supposed to be an off day for the Padres. "We just felt like people wanted to go home. They wanted to be home on the off day," said Bard, whose team hosts the Los Angeles Dodgers for a three-game series beginning Tuesday. "We're just excited getting out of here taking two of three." Since being suspended three games for his actions in a physical encounter with umpires in Pittsburgh on Thursday &#8212; when his apparent home run was reversed and ruled a double &#8212; Bard is 5-for-9 with two doubles, a homer and six RBIs. Washington's Austin Kearns had to make a running catch on the warning track in right field on Bard's seventh-inning sacrifice fly, which came with the bases loaded. "He's swinging the bat better," Padres manager Bud Black said. "He would have had a real big game if Kearns hadn't made the play against him." Bard's three-run homer gave the Padres a first-inning lead, and Hiram Bocachica's solo homer &#8212; his first hit since being claimed on waivers from Oakland on Thursday &#8212; snapped a fifth-inning tie. Wells (3-3) prospered in terrible weather conditions to win for the second time in seven starts. The left-hander allowed three runs on five hits, walked none and struck out two as the Padres won for the seventh time in nine games. Ryan Zimmerman homered for the Nationals, who fell to 6-22 against the Padres since August 2003. Steady, and sometimes heavy, rain eventually turned a drizzle by the seventh inning, as the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry passed through the mid-Atlantic. Sandbags greeted early arrivals in the dugouts, water collected between first and second bases, and the grounds crew repeatedly spread drying compound on the soggy infield. "You were lucky to have a dry ball at any given time," Wells said. "It was terrible. I'm glad we played, but I don't know why we should. Somebody could have gotten hurt." After Marcus Giles singled, Terrmel Sledge reached on a bunt single when no one covered first and Bard hit a one-out homer to right off Jason Simontacchi's 0-1 pitch for a 3-0 lead. "When you throw into his swing pattern, he's going to hit the ball hard. ... You try to hit your spots, and obviously, down and in isn't a good spot," Simontacchi said. Washington tied it in the third on Zimmerman's homer. Nook Logan singled, went to second on a sacrifice, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Ronnie Belliard's double. Zimmerman then crushed his team-leading eighth home run, a mammoth shot that landed a third of the way up in the left-field upper deck. "They told me where it went. Thats pretty far up there, I guess," Zimmerman said. Simontacchi (2-4) retired 12 straight after Bard's homer before Bocachica connected with one out in the fifth. A throwing error by Zimmerman led to two more unearned runs and Simontacchi's departure. Marcus Giles reached on Zimmerman's error and Sledge walked before Adrian Gonzalez extended his hitting streak to 10 games with a two-run double to right for a 6-3 lead. Simontacchi gave up six runs &#8212; four earned &#8212; on five hits over 4 2-3 innings. He walked one and struck out four. "I thought he pitched decent," Nationals manager Manny Acta said. "He got hurt by the miscues behind him. He made a couple of mistakes, costly ones. He made a couple of mistakes (but) we didn't play well behind him." Notes:@ OF Mike Cameron was a late scratch from the Padres' lineup because of a tight hamstring. Bocachica took over for Cameron in center field, while Bard moved into his cleanup spot. Cameron flew out as a pinch-hitter in the ninth. ... The Nationals signed 17-year-old Dominican SS Luis Castillo to a professional contract Sunday. ... San Diego 3B Kevin Kouzmanoff was hit in the right shoulder by a Simontacchi pitch in the fourth, but plate umpire Bob Davidson ruled the pitch a ball because Kouzmanoff didn't try to avoid it.

Commissioner Roger Goodell said that the 25-year-old Johnson could have the punishment reduced to six games if he complies with all conditions of the suspension, including undergoing counselling and avoiding issues with law enforcement. GoodellÂ held a meetingÂ with Johnson in New York last week. Johnson was arrested three times in just over a year and recently completed a 60-day sentence in a Cook County, Ill., jail. He was arrested for the third time in December after a search of his home uncovered six unregistered firearms, including two assault weapons, and more than 500 rounds of ammunition. The player's bodyguard, William Posey, was also charged. Just hours after issuing a public apology to fans and teammates, the six-foot-four, 300-pound Johnson was in a Chicago club when Posey was gunned down. Because he violated terms of his probation, Johnson needed permission from a judge to leave the state and suit up for the Bears in their Super Bowl game in Miami in February. Johnson recorded four tackles in Chicago's loss and shared credit with Mark Anderson for the team's only sack of Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning. In April, Adam (Pacman) Jones of the Tennessee Titans was suspended for the 2007 NFL season and Chris Henry of the Cincinnati Bengals was suspended for eight games. Jones has been arrested several times, including in connection with an incident inside a Las Vegas strip club in February. A shooting outside the club later left a man paralyzed. Henry was arrested four times in a 14-month span. Goodell announcedÂ a move towardsÂ tougher disciplinary measures in February. In recent years, suspensions have usually been in connection with violations of the league's substance abuse policy.

France, whose leadership helped turn a family-owned company into a national phenomenon, died today at his home in Daytona Beach, Fla. at the age of 74. France served as NASCAR&#8217;s president from 1972-2000, taking over from his father, NASCAR founder William H. G. &#8220;Big Bill&#8221; France. In 2000, France &#8211; known as &#8220;Bill Jr. &#8221; &#8211; became NASCAR&#8217;s CEO and the chairman of the newly created NASCAR Board of Directors. In October 2003, the torch was again passed, with France&#8217;s son Brian France taking over as Chairman and CEO. France became Vice Chairman at that time, whereupon his influence and input remained considerable &#8211; and valuable. &#8220;He had a remarkable career and an even-more remarkable life, &#8221; said Brian France. &#8220;Words cannot express how much he&#8217;ll be missed by myself and the rest of our family and by the NASCAR industry overall. &#8221; Mike Helton became NASCAR&#8217;s president in 2000. He was the third president in the sport&#8217;s history and the first not named France. &#8220;Coming in, I had two big pairs of shoes to fill, &#8221; Helton said, talking about Bill Sr. and Bill Jr. &#8220;I was more familiar with Bill Jr. &#8217;s way of doing business but that didn&#8217;t make it any easier. He blazed so many trails for our sport. He was determined to follow the vision of his father while also expanding on that vision. Over nearly four decades, he did a masterful job. &#8221; France is survived by his wife Betty Jane France, NASCAR&#8217;s assistant secretary; his son Brian; daughter Lesa France Kennedy, NASCAR&#8217;s vice president and assistant treasurer; his brother James C. France, NASCAR&#8217;s vice chairman and executive vice president; and three grandchildren. Funeral arrangements are pending.

France Jr., vice chairman of Nascar and chairman of automobile racetrack operator International Speedway Corp., died today, according to Nascar. He was 74. France, the son of National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing founder William Henry Getty France, became the head of Nascar, the biggest U.S. auto-racing organization, after his father retired in 1972. France Jr. turned over the job of chief executive officer and chairman of Nascar to his son Brian France in 2003. ``France was a major force, if not the major force, in the rise of Nascar,&#39;&#39; said Jon Ackley, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor who teaches a course in the business of Nascar. ``France&#39;s recognition of the relationship between technology and bringing racing closer to the fans is perhaps his biggest contribution.&#39;&#39; France died shortly after 1 p.m. New York time today, Nascar spokeswoman Traci Eberts said. The cause of death was not known. At the time, a race in Nascar&#39;s top series, the Nextel Cup, was being run in Dover, Delaware. France had a mild heart attack while at a Nascar race in Japan in 1997. In 1999, he was diagnosed and treated for cancer. France never revealed the type of cancer involved. He was born April 4, 1933, in Washington, and moved with his family in 1935 to Daytona Beach, Florida. William France Sr. organized track operators and racers around the U.S. Southeast and formed Nascar in 1948. France Jr. brought the association to national attention when he signed R.J. Reynolds tobacco as the series sponsor in 1973. Six years later he convinced CBS television to broadcast the Daytona 500 race live nationwide. Nascar says it is now the second-most-watched sport on television after the National Football League. France ranked 512th among the world&#39;s richest people in 2006, with an estimated net worth of $1.5 billion, according to Forbes magazine. His daughter, Lesa France Kennedy, is president of Daytona Beach-based International Speedway Corp. Shares of International Speedway, the biggest U.S. racetrack operator, rose 44 cents to $53.30 at 3 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company&#39;s tracks include Daytona International Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway and Darlington Raceway.

Angels won 4-3. (AP Photo/Mark Avery) ANAHEIM, Calif. Jun 3, 2007 (AP) With one powerful swing, Vladimir Guerrero gave the Los Angeles Angels another pulsating victory. Guerrero hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth off Chris Ray, and the Angels beat the Baltimore Orioles 4-3 on Sunday after being held to one hit through the first seven innings by Jeremy Guthrie. "It feels very good, especially knowing what our guys did on the mound, to be able to pick them up," Guerrero said through a translator. "The hits were hard to come by today. Some solid contact, but their guy also did a good job. Definitely, it's a huge win for us." Chone Figgins greeted Ray (3-4) with a leadoff single in the ninth, and the right-hander went to a 1-1 count on Guerrero before the 2004 AL MVP drove a hanging slider to left-center for his 350th career homer and 12th this season. "Something in my heart told me that Vladdy was going to hit a homer," Angels starter Ervin Santana said. "He waited for his pitch and he hit it good." The blown save was Ray's fourth in 16 chances. "Every loss is tough, especially when you lose in the ninth inning," Ray said. "I don't feel good about it. Jeremy pitched a great game and he deserved to win it. It didn't come out that way, so obviously it's tough for him to have thrown that great and not get a decision out of it." Guthrie allowed two runs one earned and three hits over eight innings, struck out four and did not walk a batter in his seventh start of the season. The right-hander, moved into the rotation full-time on May 8 when Jaret Wright went on the disabled list, has a 1.68 ERA in the starting role. "You work for consistency," Guthrie said. "It's always a pleasant surprise anytime you're pitching at this level to have that kind of consistency, so I'm very grateful. Every time I go out, and almost every inning that I get through, I feel a lot of gratitude because these guys are good hitters and anything can happen on any pitch. So to string together a bunch of good innings like that is humbling." Angels Top Orioles on Vlad's Walk-Off Comment on This Story WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts. Tell us what you know.

Brent Bozell III Frank J. Gaffney Jr. Phantom of the Movies Clicks and Mortar Column Dispatches from the Gulf The World & I Add To Insider Newsclips Under the weather, Nats look sloppy in loss Terrmel Sledge went 2-for-3 and scored two runscq in the Padres? win over the Nationals. JOSEPH SILVERMAN (THE WASHINGTON TIMES) The infield was a soupy mixture of mud, large puddles and Diamond Dry. Sandbags lined the dugouts and batting tunnels in an effort to avoid flooding. The rain fell in waves, at times turning sideways from the strong wind that circled around RFK Stadium as the remnants of a tropical storm swept through town. And yet they played baseball yesterday afternoon. Somehow, the grounds crew managed to keep the pitcher&#39;s mound together, the infield semi-playable and the dugouts dry. The 26,967 fans in attendance did their best to battle the elements, taking refuge in the covered sections of the ballpark yet still needing to wear bright-colored ponchos to keep themselves from turning into prunes. When it was over, the Washington Nationals had been dealt a 7-3 loss by the San Diego Padres, who took advantage of some key defensive miscues to leave town with a comfortable victory. The Nationals, though, may have considered themselves victorious (or at least lucky) after surviving this mud wrestling match without suffering any injuries. "I am glad we got it through without anyone getting hurt," manager Manny Acta said. "I kind of did a lot of praying out there throughout the nine innings." Pitchers from both sides were tentative on the mound, not wanting to lose footing and pull a groin or hamstring muscle. Infielders waded through the slop with caution. Batters dug into the muddy box and hoped for the best. "Terrible, terrible and even worse," said Padres starter David Wells, who earned the win with five effective innings. "You were lucky to have a dry ball at any given time. It was terrible. I&#39;m glad we played, but I don&#39;t know why we should." The game was played because Nationals officials didn&#39;t want to send a large Sunday crowd (including thousands of Little Leaguers who paraded around the warning track pregame) home and ask everyone to come back this afternoon for a makeup date. Both teams have today off and could have returned, but there would have been a problem finding an available umpiring crew (because yesterday&#39;s quartet had to leave town for the start of another series). So they played, taking breaks every half-inning for the grounds crew to emerge and try to sop up various spots in the infield where standing water had developed. "It was better to go ahead and play the game than to hang around and kind of mess up our schedule tomorrow," Washington third baseman Ryan Zimmerman said. "I think it kind of looked a lot worse than it really was." Even if the weather had nothing to do with it, the Nationals came out sloppy and suffered for it. Right-hander Jason Simontacchi surrendered a leadoff single to Marcus Giles in the first, then charged in to field Terrmel Sledge&#39;s sacrifice bunt attempt. But when Simontacchi whirled to throw to first, no one was there. First baseman Dmitri Young also had come charging in to field the ball, and second baseman Ronnie Belliard never broke to cover.

Click me to Current Pistons mere shadow of Bad Boys Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James hoists the trophy after the Cavaliers beat the Detroit Pistons, 98-82, to win the NBA Eastern Conference championship, Saturday, in Cleveland. Photograph by : Associated Press/Tony Dejak Bob Duff, CanWest News Service; Windsor Star Published: Monday, June 04, 2007 WINDSOR, Ont. - As finishes go, this one was more feeble than fantastic. It's all done now for the Detroit Pistons. The season, after a 98-82 drubbing by the Cleveland Cavaliers Saturday in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference final. And the legacy. Not to mention the comparisons. Ever since the Pistons won the 2003-'04 National Basketball Association title, as part of back-to-back runs to the NBA final, the debate has raged among supporters of the team. Which dynasty was better - the Bad Boys or the current edition of the team? It's safe to say that argument can now be shelved. It's the Bad Boys in a landslide. They won two straight titles, which in itself should end the parallels. But more importantly, they remembered the root cause of their success and never forgot what made them famous. While digesting the demise of the Pistons, chew on a couple of thoughts: - How many championship rings have the Pistons earned since Larry Brown exited as coach? - How many titles have they won since Ben Wallace took the money and ran to Chicago? The answer is as empty as the playoff hopes of the Pistons are today. Brown used to stress that winning was about playing the game the right way and no one can dispute that's exactly how the Pistons played under his leadership. Certainly, Brown's ego was as vast as his knowledge of the game, but does that make him any different than Scotty Bowman? The Detroit Red Wings knew what they were getting when they hired Bowman, but dealt with the difficulties, because it resulted in three Stanley Cups. Another reason why the Wings won? Strong leadership. Steve Yzerman ruled the ship and no one questioned his authority in the dressing room. Ben Wallace filed that role for the Pistons. They were a team built around his image, a group of misfits who together were formidable opponents. Does anyone actually think Cleveland's LeBron James goes for 48 points in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference final if Ben was present to provide help defence to his teammates? It was evident last season that Ben was clearly unhappy with the course the team was charting under new coach Flip Saunders, one that was taking them away from the strong emphasis on defensive play. Today, it's also evident that Wallace had a point. When Detroit won, the Pistons did it in such un-NBA like fashion. It was about everyone pulling the rope in the same direction. Absent their glue, as everything came apart against the Cavaliers, so did the Pistons. When collectiveness was most needed, instead, there was bickering. "The way our team is, it's always been one to point fingers at each other," Saunders suggested, seeking to put a happy face on Detroit's sad demise. "It's important for players to not be afraid to hold another player accountable." Saunders likes to say that the NBA is a player's league and in Detroit's case, instead of Ben Wallace's team, it's become a team built in Rasheed Wallace's image - still capable of greatness, but equally as likely to collapse into a sea of selfishness. "We're built as a five-man unit, so when one of our players breaks down in that five-man unit, either offensively or defensively, we can look really bad because we don't have the one guy that can bail you out," Saunders said. They certainly ended up looking very bad when it mattered most this season, which leads to another pertinent question. Perhaps it's time to sink this ship and chart a new course for the Pistons.

(AP Photo/M. Spencer Green) NFL Suspends Tank Johnson for 8 Games NEW YORK - Tank Johnson of the Chicago Bears was suspended by the NFL for the first eight games of the 2007 regular season for violating the league's new personal conduct policy. The defensive tackle recently served a two-month jail stint on a probation violation on gun-related charges. He's the third player suspended by commissioner Roger Goodell in little more than a month for off-field behavior. In April, Goodell suspended Tennessee Titans defensive back Adam "Pacman" Jones for the entire 2007 season and Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry for eight games. Jones is appealing his suspension. Goodell said Johnson's suspension could be reduced to six games if he has no further involvement with law enforcement and undergoes counseling. After meeting with Goodell last month upon his release, Johnson said he was ready to accept whatever punishment Goodell handed down and that he wants to become the NFL's "Man of the Year," the player honored for being its best citizen.

The most heated talk was from Neil, the feisty Ottawa Senators winger who was accused by Anaheim GM Brian Burke of trying to take Ducks forward 's head off with an elbow. McDonald was not hurt on the play. Burke said Neil's hit was worse than the forearm to the chops that Pronger delivered on McAmmond early in the third period that knocked the Ottawa centre out cold and left him doubtful to play in Game 4. Neil took a long run at McDonald, but said the hit was clean. "My elbows were down and when McDonald sees me, he just falls," Neil said ahead of Game 4 on Monday night. "I didn't hit him as good as people think. "He just bails on the whole situation. That's his own fault there." It's the second time in this year's playoffs Pronger has been suspended - he also got one game for banging 's head off the glass in the Western Conference final - and the sixth time in his career. Ottawa coach Bryan Murray said Pronger had two more hits to the head in the game, while Neil said illegal hits are a habit with the Ducks star defenceman. "I don't go out and stab a guy in the back after a whistle like Pronger does," said Neil. "Or slash you in the back of the legs, or grab you, and that's what he does. "I think the officials are aware of that. You go out and play hard between whistles and if something happens, you take care of it. That's the way I play. He's been suspended a numerous amount of games for different incidents. I haven't, so figure it out." There are people in Buffalo who would beg to differ after Neil's shoulder hit to the head that KO'd Sabres star in February. That sparked a mass brawl highlighted by two separate fights involving Ottawa's - a clear win over fellow goalie and a decision loss to tough guy wasn't impressed with Neil's outburst. "That's childish stuff," he said. "We're not going to call anybody out. "The same thing happens to our guy, but he doesn't get hurt. That happens on the ice and that's where it should stay. We don't need to play these games in the media." But when hits to the head occur, tempers flare and words are exchanged, especially in front of the media. That the incident happened just before the NHL's general managers met on Monday in Ottawa, with stiffer penalties for hits to the head high on the agenda, added extra spice to the debate. Murray opted for a smiling riposte for Burke's attempt to deflect criticism off Pronger and onto Neil. "Brian did a great job of giving you guys (reporters) a story and camouflaging what was the real point," said Murray. "I've got two other incidents with Pronger hitting to the head. never hits anyone without going to the head. There's lots we can point out. But Brian sold lots of papers for you and gave you an easy Sunday afternoon." Perry was as surprised as any to hear his name mentioned. "I don't go out there and try to hurt anybody," he said. "It's not my style of game. "I play hard and try to win. But if they think that, good for them." That the Senators considered putting McAmmond in the lineup at all prompted a tongue-in-cheek insinuation from Ducks coach Randy Carlyle's that "people make huge strides in their recovery after suspensions. It's amazing." McAmmond, who lay on the ice for several minutes after the hit and said he had headaches and a stiff neck the next day, was one of the cooler heads. But he agreed that Pronger deserved to be suspended. "I think I caught him flat-footed because there was a turnover," he said of the incident. "I was just trying to step around. "It looked like he was trying to step up on me and play the body and when I tried to step around, he reactively threw his elbow out and that was it." McAmmond recalled when he was playing for the Calgary Flames and teammate took an elbow to the head from Dallas defenceman on a similar play. "Lombardi was still having repercussions from it almost a year later when I saw him in the minors," added McAmmond. "There was no suspension. "I think you should look at the flagrancy and not at whether the guy gets up right away or is gone the whole year." As for exaggerating his injury to help draw Pronger's suspension, McAmmond said "they can think what they want." Pronger didn't dispute his suspension, although he denied trying to injure McAmmond. But blows to the head, intentional or not, raise concern from both teams involved. "Chris got his arm up and got him in the chin," said Perry. "They're trying to get head shots out of the game, so it's unfortunate that we lose him, but on the other hand, you don't like to see a player get hurt and lay on the ice like that."

A Roland Garros perennial, Moya was nonetheless the younger player Monday, and he advanced to the quarterfinals by beating the 35-year-old Bjorkman 7-6 (5), 6-2, 7-5. Wearing a sleeveless shirt and his cap backward, the 30-year-old Moya hardly looked like an old-timer. But he became the oldest man to reach the final eight at the French Open since Andre Agassi in 2003. Moya won the title in 1998 and is playing in the tournament for the 12th year in a row. "Now I'm the oldest guy in the field," he said. "I still remember when I was the youngest guy in the draw, and now I became the oldest. Time passed so fast. ... When you're younger, maybe you don't value things as I do now. I enjoy more now." Also advancing was 20-year-old Novak Djokovic, who beat unseeded Fernando Verdasco 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (1) to reach the quarterfinals for the second consecutive year. Spain's Carlos Moya volleys the ball to Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman during their fourth round match of the French Open tennis tournament at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris, Monday, June 4, 2007. Moya won 7-6, 6-2, 7-5. (AP Photo/Michel Spingler) "Last year, I honestly didn't expect to be in the quarterfinals," Djokovic said. "I was pretty much satisfied with my achievement. This year is much different." Bjorkman, the oldest man in the 128-player draw, overcame deficits of two sets to none in the first two rounds. This time, he was the one squandering leads. The unseeded Swede was ahead 5-2 in the opening set but lost the next four games. He broke serve for 6-all and led 5-3 in the tiebreaker before Moya swept the final four points, the last with a net cord winner. Bjorkman began to show signs of wear after losing the second set, when he needed a shoulder massage from a trainer. "You know, I'm 35," Bjorkman said. "My shoulder just got more tired than it normally does. ... This is a great day. I obviously surprised myself to make the fourth round." He lost serve in the final game, pushing a tired backhand into the net on match point. The No. 23-seeded Moya, long known for his Popeye-size right biceps, hit 21 forehand winners to three for Bjorkman, and the disparity helped the Spaniard save 11 of the 14 break points he faced. Bjorkman came forward frequently, but Moya often responded with pinpoint passing shots. Moya reached the quarterfinals for the fourth time, but the first time since 2004. "It's much less pressure for me when everybody is talking about Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, and nobody is talking about you," he said. "It helps you." Like Moya, the No. 6-seeded Djokovic benefited from a lucky bounce on an important point. It came in the tiebreaker, when his backhand kissed the net cord before dropping for a winner. Djokovic crossed himself in gratitude. Verdasco retrieved the ball and put it in his courtside bag, prompting laughter from the crowd. Verdasco shanked a forehand on match point, a fitting finish. The big-swinging Spaniard committed 50 unforced errors. By the middle of the second set, when Djokovic led 4-0, he had a frustrated Verdasco talking to himself. "I was stepping in more, and I was being aggressive," Djokovic said. "I played the best tennis in the important moments." Djokovic, two points from defeat in a five-set win Saturday over Olivier Patience, will next play the winner of the match between No. 16 Marcos Baghdatis and unseeded Igor Andreev. Moya will play the winner of the match between two-time defending champion Nadal, seeded second, and No. 14 Lleyton Hewitt. In the women's quarterfinals Tuesday, two-time defending champion Justine Henin will face eight-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams in a rematch of their contentious 2003 semifinal at Roland Garros. Williams advanced Sunday by beating No. 10 Dinara Safina. Henin defeated No. 20 Sybille Bammer 6-2, 6-4. Jelena Jankovic and Nicole Vaidisova meet for the other semifinal spot in the top half of the draw. The bottom half includes three Russians _ Maria Sharapova will play Anna Chakvetadze, and Svetlana Kuznetsova faces Serbian Ana Ivanovic.

The announcement came on the day of the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series race in Dover, DE -- a day late due to rain. "I loved that old man. He's done a lot for a lot of people. The things I can remember most are when he told me that I did a good job. He only did it about twice, but when he did, you knew it meant something. I just don't know what we're going to do now that we don't have him," said Darrell Waltrip during the Fox broadcast. In March, he was admitted to Halifax Medical Center just down International Speedway Boulevard from its namesake, the Daytona International Speedway -- corner stone of the France-family's NASCAR empire -- and later released to spend his final days at home under the care of his personal physician. With a clear vision and sheer force of will, France's father Big Bill formed NASCAR in 1947, building it around the country boy racers and hardscrabble, red clay short tracks of the Eastern seaboard's piedmont plateau. The organization that Bill Jr. inherited from his father in 1972 was primed -- with the right leadership -- to move up the sports-entertainment ladder. Big Bill's son was the right man at the right time. Under Bill Jr.'s guidance, NASCAR began a steady, carefully orchestrated period of growth. Leaning heavily on the loyalty of track-owners and sponsors like RJ Reynolds and Unocal, France took stock car racing as far as it could go as a largely regional sport and then had to make a decision. By the late 1980s stock car racing had reached critical mass. To storm the national stage, NASCAR had to expand beyond the dozen token races run outside the South. So kicked off an unprecedented growth spurt, marked by skyrocketing race attendance and television viewership and a rapid consolidation in racetrack ownership. With France's International Speedway Corporation (ISC) at the forefront, public companies bought, renovated and built venues at a dizzying pace. Today, two companies own 20 of the 24 racetracks that host NASCAR's top Nextel Cup Series -- ISC controlling a dozen of those tracks. With that growth came painful decisions. Historic racetracks in the South were trimmed away to make room for new sites across the country. Familiar sponsors were outbid by companies willing to spend big bucks to bathe in NASCAR's sunshine. One significant move was to consolidate television coverage of NASCAR events. All these changes came on Bill France Jr.'s watch. When Mr. France turned day-to-day operations of the multi-billion dollar sports-entertainment juggernaut over to his son Brian in 2003, NASCAR was -- by most measures -- second only to the National Football League in popularity and economic impact on the American sporting scene. France was a soft-spoken, private man, not overly fond of center stage. Yet his presence never failed to create a quiet stir, as his influence spread throughout the world of motorsports. France knew the big picture because -- in American racing -- he painted the big picture. France remained Chairman of the Board and went to his office every day up until his final hospitalization, March 14. He is survived by his wife Betty Jane, one son Brian, a daughter Lesa and a brother Jim France -- each of whom plays an influential role in the family business. &copy; 1994-2007 Motorsport.com, Inc.

Adams, 33, will meet the Broncos' need for a bigger interior presence.Adams is a proven defender versus the run, a mammoth inside presence who regularly commands double-team blocking, and who can engulf offensive linemen. A classic two-gap player, he rarely registers impressive tackle numbers, but his value has never been measured by statistics. By typically occupying two blockers on running downs, he usually allows other defenders to flow to the football.His stay in Cincinnati, where he played only one season of the three-year contract that he signed last spring, was surprisingly short-lived, given his relationship with coach Marvin Lewis. But the Bengals wanted to get younger at defensive tackle and there were some concerns about Adams' health and age.Last summer, Lewis held Adams out of the first several weeks of training camp, keeping him off the field until he was comfortable the veteran tackle had improved his conditioning. Once the season started, however, Adams played and started in all 16 games. For his career, he has demonstrated remarkable durability, missing only 13 games. Adam has never sat out more than four games in a season, and not more than three games since 1999.Adams did have arthroscopic knee surgery shortly after the season ended, in part because he knew he wanted to return for a 14th year, and sources said the Rams were satisfied with his progress in rehabilitation. Although he has struggled at times with weight problems, Adams weighed in the low 340s for the Rams, a manageable number for him.A former Texas A&M star, Adams was a first-round draft choice of the in 1994, the eighth player chosen overall that year. In stints with Seattle (1994-99), Baltimore (2000-2001), Oakland (2002), Buffalo (2003-2005) and Cincinnati (2006), he has appeared in 195 games, with 166 starts, and has registered 452 tackles, 44 sacks, six forced fumbles, five recoveries and 32 pass deflections.

"We're not scheduling, but we're tentatively looking at possibly next weekend," Yankees manager Joe Torre said. Clemens, 44, met with team medical staff Sunday in Tampa, Fla., and has been scheduled for an MRI so the Yankees can better determine the right-hander's physical state. As of right now, all the club has been able to go on is Clemens' self-diagnosis from Friday, when he buzzed general manager Brian Cashman's cell phone from Houston and reported that he would not be able to pitch on Monday at Chicago due to a "fatigued groin." "This man knows what he can and can't do from past experiences," Cashman said. "Apparently he was feeling a little something and didn't think it was a big deal. Yesterday, it was still there, and that's when he decided [he] couldn't do this." Clemens is believed to have tweaked a groin muscle during the first inning of his start last week for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and the club has speculated Clemens reaggravated it during a bullpen session at Yankee Stadium last Wednesday. Cashman said that Clemens will remain in Tampa as he works his way toward starting the clock on the prorated $28 million, one-year deal he signed with the Yankees on May 6. Cashman described the hurler as "optimistic" that his recovery would not take long. The possibility of groin injuries was a risk the team was willing to accept when they entered into the agreement to bring Clemens, who pitched for the Yankees from 1999-2003, back to the Bronx, Cashman said. "This is something that is the reality of Roger," Cashman said. "Throughout his career, he's had a lot of injuries there in the groin. Historically, he gets through it. He knows his body and this is part of him." Torre said he had no qualms about counting on the soon to be 45-year-old Rocket to be a productive member of the Yankees' rotation. "I know he's getting up there in age and all that stuff," Torre said. "Knock on wood, the only issues he's had have been with the lower half of his body. That's pretty good." Because Clemens is on a Minor League contract, Cashman said that no part of Clemens' contract is guaranteed, nor do the Yankees have a set date on which they must add the seven-time Cy Young Award winner to their roster. But Cashman rejected the suggestion that the Yankees might decide to part ways with Clemens given their sizable deficit in the American League East - just 5 1/2 games on the day Clemens signed, the gap between the Yankees and the division-leading Red Sox had swelled to 13 1/2 games entering play Sunday. "I want to have a healthy Roger Clemens, when he's ready, to assist this team because we still have a shot," Cashman said. "We're in this thing, we're not out of it. He can make an impact for us." is a reporter for MLB.com. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs.

The commitment from the Canucks, who basically met Pyatt's asking price, shows that Pyatt accomplished what he set out to do when Vancouver traded for him last July -- he proved himself. Pyatt's career had fallen off the rails before the Canucks came calling last summer, giving up a 2007 fourth-round pick to get him. Email to a friend "He came to Vancouver looking to have a clean slate and, like every player in the NHL, he just wanted an opportunity to show what he can do," said his agent, Todd Christie. "Obviously, there were no guarantees. It just worked out in a fortunate way for him to play with some great players." Those players were the Sedin twins, who helped Pyatt elevate his game. Daniel and Henrik have been given a lot of credit for Pyatt's season. At least one Sedin assisted on 14 of Pyatt's 23 goals. "They contributed to his success, no question," Christie said. "But I would suggest his style of play and the way he fit in with them contributed to their success as well. It was obviously a situation that benefited all parties." But the Canucks, desperate to find more scoring for next season, will need more from Pyatt, who won't be the $700,000 bargain he was last year, with or without the Sedin twins helping him. The Canucks don't have much room left this offseason in roster spots or salary cap space to find scoring. Five of their top-six forward spots appear to be already slotted with the Sedin twins, Markus Naslund, Brendan Morrison and Pyatt. The Canucks now have 13 players signed for next season for $39.745 million US. That doesn't include Marc Chouinard who finished last season in the AHL but is still due $1.1 million.

Foyt Indy 225 at the historic Milwaukee Mile. The No.11 Andretti Green Racing driver crossed the finish line 2.5707 seconds ahead of Dario Franchitti. The victory was Kanaan's second of the season and ninth of his IndyCar career. After winning his fourth pole of the season Castroneves led the 18-car field to the green flag for 225 laps of short-track racing. The No.3 Honda was able to pull away from the field early as Kanaan, Scott Dixon and Dan Wheldon battled for the second spot. On lap 14 Castroneves was already starting to lap some of his competitors as he passed Sarah Fisher. The first caution flag of the race came out on lap 22 for debris on the middle of the frontstretch. Under the caution period Castroneves led the leaders down pit road for their first stops. Buddy Rice inherited the first position by staying out on the track. Castroneves won the race off pit road followed by Kanaan. After the restart the No.15 Honda held onto the lead despite being on older tires. A few laps later Kanaan passed Castroneves to take over the second spot. But eventually Castroneves would take the second spot back. As Castroneves and Kanaan battled for second Rice increased his margin to one second. But Castroneves quickly started to cut into that lead and on lap 62 Castroneves took the inside lane to pass Rice. Rice continued to fall back through the field as he got ready to make his first pit stop. The No.3 Honda once again started to put some distance between himself and the field. Kanaan drove in second followed by Hornish Jr., Wheldon and Franchitti. The next caution flag came out on lap 89 for a Danica Patrick spin out. This caution period allowed for the leaders to make another round of pit stops. A great stop by Wheldon's pit crew put him in first when the stops were completed. Castroneves fell to the second followed by Hornish Jr., Dixon and Franchitti. Kanaan didn't get enough fuel during his stop and had to come back down pit road for a second time. Wheldon led the field to the restart on lap 97. During the next lap Castroneves went underneath him coming out of turn three to take back the lead. At the halfway mark of the race Castroneves held a 1.5 second lead over Wheldon. His margin over Penske teammate Hornish Jr., the third place driver, was at 4.7 seconds. The No.3 Honda continued to show the way. Castroneves and Wheldon quickly pulled away from the field. Dixon and Franchitti battled for the third spot but trailed the leader by almost 10 seconds. The huge margin was erased when a caution flag for debris in turn three came out on lap 135. During the caution period the leaders went down pit road for service. Another great job by Wheldon's pit crew helped him beat Castroneves off pit road for first position. Franchitti, Dixon and Hornish Jr. rounded out the top-five after the stops. The No.10 held off Castroneves on the restart and started to increase his margin. By lap 150 the lead reached 1.3 seconds. Franchitti, who was running in third, trailed Wheldon by more than four seconds. On lap 158 Rice got into the marbles and slammed into the wall to bring out another caution flag. This crash ended Rice's day after he had lead 37 laps of the race. During the caution period the leaders made their last pit stops of the race. Another excellent stop by Wheldon helped him maintain the lead. Castroneves came out of the pits in second. A great stop by Vitor Meira put him in the third spot. On the lap 169 restart Castroneves flew to the inside coming into turn one and in the process went underneath Wheldon to take the lead. Wheldon and Meira both started to fall back through the field. The race became a three-car battle as Castroneves led Hornish Jr. and Kanaan. With 35 laps remaining the margin for the No.3 Honda reached two seconds. His lead increased as Hornish Jr. and Kanaan battled each other for second. Kanaan would eventually win the fight. Only 24 laps were left in the race when disaster struck the race leader. In turn four the right-rear wing bracket collapsed on Castroneves' car sending him into the inside wall and ending his day. Castroneves led a race-high 126 of 225 laps. Kanaan was now the leader after the crash by Castroneves. He led Hornish Jr., Wheldon and Franchitti to the restart with 17 laps remaining. Only a few laps were run before Marco Andretti brought out a record sixth caution flag. With 10 laps to go Kanaan led the field to the restart. The No.11 Andretti Green Racing driver held onto his lead as the battle heated up behind him. Franchitti passed Wheldon for the third spot but was looking to gain more. The race had just seven laps left when another team Penske driver had wing problems. Hornish Jr., who was in second, had a left-rear wing bracket collapse. Franchitti would pass him for second as Hornish Jr. eventually took his car down pit lane. As the laps wound down it became clear that nobody was going to catch Kanaan, barring any last minute mistakes by Kanaan. Kanaan kept it mistake free and crossed the finish line. Wheldon, Dixon and Meira completed the top-five. Franchitti's second place finish moves him to the top of the standings with 221 points, three more than Wheldon. Dixon is third overall, just five points behind Franchitti. With the win, Kanaan jumped up to fourth place 20 points back. The next IndyCar Series race is set for Saturday night, June 9th at the Texas Motor Speedway. &#169;2007 The Sports Network. All Rights Reserved.

The world number two spoke of his respect for Australian Hewitt in the build-up to their fourth round meeting but he showed him scant regard as he comprehensively outplayed the 14th seed during a 6-3 6-1 7-6 victory. The next obstacle in his sights is boyhood hero, friend and compatriot Carlos Moya after the 30-year-old former champion beat 35-year-old Swede Jonas Bjorkmann 7-6 6-2 7-5 to reach the quarter-finals for the fourth time. "It won't be a foregone conclusion, I'm going to enjoy playing against him on Centre Court," Moya, now the oldest player left in the draw, said of his impending clash with a player yet to drop a set here this year. Serbian sixth seed Novak Djokovic and Russian outsider Igor Andreev also came through to complete the last eight, with victories over Fernando Verdasco and Marcos Baghdatis respectively on a humid day in the French capital. Hewitt, who became the youngest world number one in 2001 aged 20, is one of just four active players with a winning record against Nadal and a slender defeat in Hamburg recently suggested a tight battle here. The Australian had lost the opening sets in both his previous rounds and was slow out of the blocks again as Nadal stormed through the first two sets. Hewitt showed typical grit when Nadal stepped up to serve for the match at 6-5 in the third set, breaking to extend the champion into a tiebreak. He then had a great chance at 5-4 in the tiebreak, only to fire a halfcourt forehand tamely into the net. A Nadal smash then brought up matchpoint and he needed just one opportunity as Hewitt again netted a forehand. The list of players capable of stopping Nadal is a short one. Roger Federer obviously tops it, but 20-year-old Djokovic, the youngest player to reach the fourth round, beefed up his case as he made made mincemeat of Verdasco, winning 6-3 6-3 7-6. He joins compatriots Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic in the quarter-finals, a new Serbian record, and a juicy semi-final against Nadal is looming. Kitted out in bright yellow shirt and black shorts, Djokovic buzzed across the red clay, stinging Verdasco with winners from every conceivable angle to seize a two-set lead. Verdasco forced scrambled into a tiebreak in the third set but the writing was on the wall when a fizzing Djokovic backhand dropped dead off the netcord to give him a 4-1 lead. The Serbian looked to the heavens, arms aloft, but he needed no further assistance from above as he moved into his second successive Roland Garros quarter-final. "The first three matches here I played against players ranked much lower than me and didn't play my best tennis," said Djokovic, who was two points from defeat against French wildcard Olivier Patience on Sunday. "But I'm very happy about today. I've got a lot of confidence and motivation for my next match," added Djokovic who could reach the semi-final without facing a seed. His next opponent is the 23-year-old Andreev, who reached his first grand slam quarter-final with a resounding 2-6 6-1 6-3 6-4 defeat of an out-of-sorts Baghdatis. Bjorkman had his chances against Moya, leading 5-2 in the first set and 5-3 in the tiebreak, before losing to the 1998 champion who proved he is still a force on clay.

Chone Figgins greeted Ray (3-4) with a leadoff single in the ninth before Guerrero drove a hanging slider to left-center for his 350th career homer and 12th this season. It was the fourth blown save for Ray in 16 chances. Tigers 9, Cleveland 2 At Cleveland, Jeremy Bonderman stayed unbeaten despite another shaky first inning, and Detroit defeated Cleveland to split a four-game series. Gary Sheffield hit a two-run homer off Jeremy Sowers (1-6) for the Tigers, who pulled within 200BD> games of first-place Cleveland in the AL Central with a second straight win after going 0-5 against the Indians. Athletics 4, Twins 2 At Oakland, Calif., Chad Gaudin outpitched Johan Santana for his fifth straight win, and Oakland took two of three games from Minnesota in a playoff rematch. Santana (6-5) walked a season-high four and ran into trouble early. He allowed four runs, three earned, and five hits in six innings as the Twins had their streak of four straight series victories snapped. Blue Jays 4, White Sox 3 At Toronto, Adam Lind made up for a baserunning blunder with a go-ahead, three-run double in the sixth inning that helped Toronto beat Chicago. One inning after he was called out for leaving second base early while trying to tag up on Vernon Wells' sacrifice fly, Lind erased a 3-1 deficit with a bases-loaded double off reliever Nick Masset (2-2). Devil Rays 5, Royals 1 At St. Petersburg, Fla., J.P. Howell pitched eight impressive innings in his first start this season, and Tampa Bay got solo homers from Delmon Young and Carlos Pena in a victory over Kansas City. Yankees 6, Red Sox 5 At Boston, Alex Rodriguez hit a tiebreaking homer in the ninth inning on an 0-2 pitch from star closer Jonathan Papelbon, and New York rallied past Boston to take two of three in the series. Papelbon (0-1) easily retired his first two batters. But A-Rod hit a liner into the Red Sox bullpen in right-center, giving him 20 homers for the 12th straight season. Cubs 10, Atlanta 1 At Chicago, the Cubs came out swinging - and no, not at each other. Mark DeRosa hit a grand slam, Alfonso Soriano and Derrek Lee added solo homers, and the Cubs closed out a tumultuous weekend by beating the Braves to snap a six-game losing streak. The win came after manager Lou Piniella got suspended indefinitely for his dirt-kicking tirade against an umpire Saturday. It also capped a series that began Friday with pitcher Carlos Zambrano and catcher Michael Barrett fighting in the dugout and clubhouse. Phillies 9, Giants 8 At Philadelphia, Shane Victorino hit a game-ending homer in the ninth inning, and Ryan Howard's three-run shot in the seventh helped the Phillies outslug San Francisco. With the score tied and one out, Victorino drove a 1-0 pitch from Kevin Correia (1-2) over the left-field fence for the first game-winning homer of his career. Cardinals 8, Astros 6 At Houston, So Taguchi and Albert Pujols hit 10th-inning homers off Dan Wheeler, lifting St. Louis to its fourth win in five games. Pujols also homered in the eighth off Chad Qualls, and David Eckstein hit his sixth career leadoff home run for the Cardinals. Diamondbacks 4, Mets 1 At New York, Doug Davis allowed a run and six hits in 7 2-3 innings and the Arizona Diamondbacks won for the ninth time in 10 games. The Diamondbacks concluded a successful six-game road trip through Philadelphia and New York, winning five of six. Meanwhile, the Mets lost a home series for the first time since April 15-17 against Atlanta. Rockies 10, Reds 9 (10) At Denver, back in the lineup after being benched for two games, Garrett Atkins homered and singled in the winning run in the 10th to help Colorado rally past Cincinnati. Kaz Matsui, who hit a bases-loaded triple in the eighth to lead Colorado's comeback from a six-run deficit, opened the 10th with a single off Victor Santos (1-1) and went to second on Santos' wild pickoff attempt. Dodgers 5, Pirates 4 At Pittsburgh, Andre Ethier's two-run homer in the eighth off former Pirates closer Salomon Torres finished Los Angeles' five-run comeback in the late innings. Dodgers closer Takashi Saito left with a sore hamstring in the bottom of the ninth, but the injury isn't considered serious. Joe Beimel was given as much time as he needed to warm up before finishing for his first save. Brewers 3, Marlins 0 At Milwaukee, Ben Sheets pitched six shutout innings and the Milwaukee Brewers won their first series in nearly a month. Sheets (6-3) struck out seven and walked one to move to 5-1 in his past seven starts. He beat Dontrelle Willis (7-4), who walked a career-high six and struck out none in six innings. It was the first time Willis has pitched more than three innings without a strikeout. Padres 7, Nationals 3 At Washington, Josh Bard homered and drove in a career-high four runs, David Wells threw five solid innings in the rain and San Diego beat Washington. Bard hit a three-run homer in the first inning, and Hiram Bocachica's solo homer - his first hit since being claimed on waivers from Oakland on Thursday - snapped a fifth-inning tie.

What mattered is the Baltimore Orioles led by a run in the ninth inning, and Manager Sam Perlozzo believed he needed to do what such a situation dictates. "Our closer is supposed to come in and get you three outs," he said. "That's Chris Ray's job, to save that game for us." But Ray, in a stunningly swift bottom of the ninth, didn't do his job, and it remains open to speculation how much longer the job will be his. Vladimir Guerrero concluded the Orioles' crushing 4-3 loss Sunday by drilling a two-run homer to right-center field, giving Baltimore three straight losses and Ray his fourth blown save this season. Los Angeles' Vlad Guerrero connects on a 1-1 pitch to send the Orioles to their third straight loss. (Mark Avery - AP) again, as Vlad Guerrero's two-run homer in the ninth inning gives the Angels a 4-3 win on Sunday. Orioles second baseman Brian Roberts has stayed hot despite a hurt right hamstring. Box score: Angels 4, O's 3 | Enhancing a Legacy Save & Share Article The blast, which clattered around the rock pile behind the fence, nullified another outstanding start from Guthrie, who, teammate Kevin Millar said, has "turned into one of the most dominating pitchers going right now in the big leagues." Guthrie allowed three hits and one earned run, mixing in more curveballs than usual but still locating his 95-mph fastball with precision. Despite the performance, 88 pitches and eight innings were enough. "You don't want that kid to lose the game," Perlozzo said. "Somebody gets on, you got to let him go out and lose the ballgame. You can't go to your closer then, you're trying to stay out of trouble. You leave him, he's got to go in and pitch the whole way through that thing. That's the job of the closer. We got ourselves right where we wanted to be." While no blown save is a calm event, Ray's meltdowns have been particularly catastrophic, and all against high-profile opponents. Three have come on home runs. Ray's last implosion came in the infamous May 13 "Mother's Day Miracle" at Fenway Park, when the final five runs crossed the plate while Ray was on the mound. On that day, too, it was Guthrie who was victimized by a bullpen disaster. Perlozzo hinted he would contemplate replacing Ray, if only he had options. Danys Baez has experience as a closer, but his ineffectiveness already has earned him a demotion from the setup role. "We got to get a little more consistent about that," Perlozzo said. "We're taxing our other guys as it is. If your closer and your eighth-inning guy can't get anybody out, where do you go?" Still, the decision to turn to Ray on Sunday was easy. Guthrie ran into his first real trouble of the day in the eighth, hitting Erick Aybar in the shin and then allowing him to score on a blooped double by Casey Kotchman. Guthrie escaped with no further damage, then walked into the dugout. Perlozzo asked, "How do you feel?" Guthrie responded, "Who's coming up?" "That's not an answer I wanted to hear," Perlozzo said. Perlozzo and Guthrie chatted more. Finally, Guthrie told him, "Let's go with Chris." "We were playing baseball the way it's supposed to be played," Guthrie said. "That's the way you play. Play to get it there, and everyone does their job." Only Ray could not do his. He started Chone Figgins with two balls, finally threw a strike, then surrendered a single to left. Up came Guerrero, whom the Orioles had held to one hit in his previous 10 at-bats. But that still fostered little confidence, given Guerrero's frightening power and disregard for pressure. Ray began Guerrero with a low fastball for strike one, then tried to make him chase a slider for ball one. Ray then came back with another slider, but this was not in the dirt. He left the pitch hanging letter-high, and Guerrero unleashed perhaps the most violent swing in the league. Jay Payton gave chase to the warning track, then punched the outfield wall as he watched the ball sail over it. Angel Stadium exploded, the Orioles slowly walked off the field and the Angels poured out of their dugout. It was a scene Ray had lived before, but one his teammates trust he can discard. "One of the best things about Ray-Ray is he has a short-term memory," Millar said. "When you are in that role, you have to." "You just have to go out and play tomorrow," Ray said. "I don't feel good about it." And so the Orioles were left to swallow another one-run loss, their 13th this season against six wins. Melvin Mora, who hit a go-ahead solo home run in the fourth, shooed away reporters and said, "I don't want to talk about that . . . game." Perlozzo tried forgetting it, too, particularly the final pitch, which he vowed not to watch on videotape. "Once is enough," he said.

Padres 7, Nationals 3 WASHINGTON (AP) -David Wells decried the deplorable conditions in which he labored, while Josh Bard tried to make the best of the wet situation. Wells threw five solid innings in the rain, Bard homered and drove in a career-high four runs and the San Diego Padres beat the Washington Nationals 7-3 on Sunday. ''Terrible, terrible and even worse,'' Wells said when asked to assess the playing conditions as the teams played in persistent precipitation. Had the game been postponed, the best makeup option would have been a Monday afternoon game on what was supposed to be an off day for the Padres. ''We just felt like people wanted to go home. They wanted to be home on the off day,'' said Bard, whose team hosts the Los Angeles Dodgers for a three-game series beginning Tuesday. ''We're just excited getting out of here taking two of three.'' Since being suspended three games for his actions in a physical encounter with umpires in Pittsburgh on Thursday - when his apparent home run was reversed and ruled a double - Bard is 5-for-9 with two doubles, a homer and six RBIs. Washington's Austin Kearns had to make a running catch on the warning track in right field on Bard's seventh-inning sacrifice fly, which came with the bases loaded. ''He's swinging the bat better,'' Padres manager Bud Black said. ''He would have had a real big game if Kearns hadn't made the play against him.'' Bard's three-run homer gave the Padres a first-inning lead, and Hiram Bocachica's solo homer - his first hit since being claimed on waivers from Oakland on Thursday - snapped a fifth-inning tie. Wells (3-3) prospered in terrible weather conditions to win for the second time in seven starts. The left-hander allowed three runs on five hits, walked none and struck out two as the Padres won for the seventh time in nine games. Ryan Zimmerman homered for the Nationals, who fell to 6-22 against the Padres since August 2003. Steady, and sometimes heavy, rain eventually turned a drizzle by the seventh inning, as the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry passed through the mid-Atlantic. Sandbags greeted early arrivals in the dugouts, water collected between first and second bases, and the grounds crew repeatedly spread drying compound on the soggy infield. ''You were lucky to have a dry ball at any given time,'' Wells said. ''It was terrible. I'm glad we played, but I don't know why we should. Somebody could have gotten hurt.'' After Marcus Giles singled, Terrmel Sledge reached on a bunt single when no one covered first and Bard hit a one-out homer to right off Jason Simontacchi's 0-1 pitch for a 3-0 lead. ''When you throw into his swing pattern, he's going to hit the ball hard. ... You try to hit your spots, and obviously, down and in isn't a good spot,'' Simontacchi said. Washington tied it in the third on Zimmerman's homer. Nook Logan singled, went to second on a sacrifice, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Ronnie Belliard's double. Zimmerman then crushed his team-leading eighth home run, a mammoth shot that landed a third of the way up in the left-field upper deck. ''They told me where it went. Thats pretty far up there, I guess,'' Zimmerman said. Simontacchi (2-4) retired 12 straight after Bard's homer before Bocachica connected with one out in the fifth. A throwing error by Zimmerman led to two more unearned runs and Simontacchi's departure. Marcus Giles reached on Zimmerman's error and Sledge walked before Adrian Gonzalez extended his hitting streak to 10 games with a two-run double to right for a 6-3 lead. Simontacchi gave up six runs - four earned - on five hits over 4 2-3 innings. He walked one and struck out four. ''I thought he pitched decent,'' Nationals manager Manny Acta said. ''He got hurt by the miscues behind him. He made a couple of mistakes, costly ones. He made a couple of mistakes (but) we didn't play well behind him.'' Notes: OF Mike Cameron was a late scratch from the Padres' lineup because of a tight hamstring. Bocachica took over for Cameron in center field, while Bard moved into his cleanup spot. Cameron flew out as a pinch-hitter in the ninth. ... The Nationals signed 17-year-old Dominican SS Luis Castillo to a professional contract Sunday. ... San Diego 3B Kevin Kouzmanoff was hit in the right shoulder by a Simontacchi pitch in the fourth, but plate umpire Bob Davidson ruled the pitch a ball because Kouzmanoff didn't try to avoid it.

Trent Rosecrans files news, comments and observations Post reporter C. Trent Rosecrans is in his first season covering the Reds after previously covering the University of Cincinnati and Xavier University for the paper. A little league teammate of former Red pitcher Jimmy Anderson, Rosecrans is a graduate of the University of Georgia and has worked at newspapers in Georgia and Alabama before coming to Cincinnati. Reds Rockies 6.2 strikes back red-hot reds vs. ice cold &#39;strohs 5.30 deep in the... reds-astros 5.29 deep in the hearta Monday, June 04, 2007 Hamilton, Coffey in; Wise, Salmon out Prior to tomorrow night's game in St. Louis, the Reds are expected to return from a rehabilitation assignment, recall from Class AAA Louisville and reinstate from the 15-day disabled list OF Josh Hamilton and recall from Louisville RHP Todd Coffey. They will take the roster spots of RHP Brad Salmon, who today was optioned to Louisville, and OF Dewayne Wise, who has been outrighted to Louisville. Since May 22 Hamilton has been on the 15-day disabled list with gastroenteritis. He hit safely in all 6 of rehab appearances for the Bats (8-24, .333, 1 2b, 4hr, 6rbi, 2sb). When he went on the DL Hamilton was hitting .261 with 8 HR and 18 RBI in 37 games for the Reds. Coffey began the season with the Reds and went 1-1, 4.94 in 26 relief appearances before he was optioned to Louisville on May 24. He did not allow a run in 6 appearances for the Bats (5.2ip, 3h, 1bb, 9k, .158oba). Salmon went 0-1, 4.50 in 11 relief apps for the Reds. Wise appeared in 5 games for the Reds. posted by ctrosecrans at With Hamilton back, how will Hopper fit into the equation? Will it be a platoon with Hamilton? Do you really think this little stint in AAA has helped Coffey? Just curious as he has been there before and it did not seem to help. But if he turns it around like EE then wow!! Any word on who goes when Freel gets back and Homer is called up? The last thread had 419 posts. Name any other blog on Cincinnati.com that gets 400 posts in a two weeks. my guess is that it will probably be mcbeth (undeservingly) that goes down when bailey comes up, but maybe the gm will make a tougher choice for once. if i had my druthers it would be stanton or the couter, who seem equally terrible. i think norris hopper may have played javy valentin out of a job, but they have more time to decide on that one. Does this mean Wise is off the 40-man roster, too? I would expect Hopper slide back into a 4th OFer role, giving Hamilton, Griffey or Dunn a day off, when needed. Griffey's been due a day off for a while, and I would expect Hopper to get starts vs LHP. Brad, I think the key phrase in your question is "when Freel gets back". Let's hope it is soon, but there have been a handful of players recently that have been affected by this for much longer than the 15-day DL stint. Most noteable is Brewers 3rd baseman Corey Koskie who will likely have to retire from baseball after having a concussion last year. I hope Coffey comes back and pitches as well as he did in AAA. I also hope Narron uses him and the rest of the bullpen a little wiser. I'm looking at Coffey's game log. Narron used him a lot. 5 of 6 games in the 2nd and 3rd series of the season. 4 of 5 days Apr 16-20. 6 of the first 8 games in May. And all 3 Nationals games before he was sent to AAA. I'm sorry to see Salmon be the one to go on such a short leash. I guess it was the 2-walk performance yesterday. He's only given up 5 hits in 10 innings pitched, but he now has 6 walks. I can't help but wonder if Majewski is pitching for his job this week. Either that or they try to pass Burton through waivers? Hopefully, the team will let McBeth pitch this time before sending him down to the minors again. Burton has to be offered back to the A's for $25,000, and then pass through waivers if the Reds were to go that route. I agree about Freel, I think this is more serious than the Reds are letting on. And Stanton must have pictures of Krivsky somewhere.... McBeth will be up for a good while I would imagine. He wasn't used in a late and close situation in Durham on Friday night; he was obviously being rested for some work in the majors. If the Reds part with either Stanton or Coutlangus then they are left with only one lefty out of the pen. I'm not sure the Reds are willing to have the lone lefty be an inexperienced Coutlangus, but I'm not sure why the Reds haven't just shot Stanton into space yet. He's worthless. I guess he's there for that "veteran presence" that keeps teams from becoming like...well...like what the Reds are. Wait, what was the point of signing "veteran baseball guys" again? As for Javy Valentin, he's a switch hitter and a fairly effective pinch hitter. He also possesses home run power, which Hopper frankly doesn't. Hopper is probably best as a 4th outfielder. We'll see how things shake out when Freel returns. I also look for the Reds to sell high on Hatteberg in the next few weeks. There are a number of teams who need a fill-in at 1b. Hi guys--don't know what to make of this, but my husband was flying through Cincy yesterday and heard one of the airlines paging "passenger Ryan Freel." I don't know how many Ryan Freels there are in the world, but I thought it was worth a mention. If it *did* happen to be the Reds' Freel, wonder if he'd be going somewhere else for further diagnosis? And would he be flying commercial? Even if Coffey is better than he was when he got sent down, who does Narron have to turn too in the Bullpen. Weathers is the closer but is having to pitch multiple innings. Stanton is terrible. Coutlangus is up and down. Majewski has not showed anything yet. Burton is rule 5. Lohse and Santos are average and probably are your long men so who does that leave for setup or short relief. Only two, Coffey and Mc Beth,and McBeth is unproven. So you keep running Coffey out there day in and day out because you have a pathetic bullpen. I guess you you just hope your starters can get you to the 7th inning every game. What is the difference in being outrighted and being optioned? I actually ran into Ryan Freel last night at Brio's at Newport on the Levee. He wasn't too insightful other than he was feeling better and was looking forward to get back with the team. This was around 6pm last night. Good to hear, Sedi. Double-checked on the time with my husband and it was a 9:15 p.m flight from Cincy to Lexington. Still may be nothing, but old reporters' curiosity dies hard. I'd let the 7th/8th inning close game, setup men be Coutlangus, McBeth, and Coffey. I'd stop with the appearances exceeding the number of innings pitched, and stop bringing a single pitcher in 7 times in ten days - Coutlangus in the series vs Cle, Was, and Pitts. Quit overusing the lefty/righty matchups. Lefties hit .214 off Coutlangus. Righties only .239. Let him pitch a full inning. I thought the Reds still have one spot open on the roster even with both of these moves. Salmon going down was necessary, I'm not sure about Coffey. Can anyone confirm if we have one open spot still? Hopper needs some action. He's a good productive ballplayer. Griffey is due a rest since he was scheduled yesterday for a rest. So tomorrow should be Dunn, Hamilton, Hopper in the OF. and this blog is the best, Brad, you're right.

World number two Nadal trails Hewitt 3-4 overall, but has won all three of the pair's clay matches. The last came in mid-May in a Hamburg semi-final in which Hewitt lost a tight third set 7-5. A day after his 21st birthday, Nadal proved dominant against the former number one Australian, 26. The second seed is now a perfect 18-0 in Paris. The Spaniard broke three times in the opening set to open the floodgates. It took 70 minutes to run up a two-sets to love lead. But Hewitt put up a huge effort in the third, betrayed a a few inopportune, unforced errors in a match which ended with a forehand to the net. Nadal will next play his Mallorcan mentor Carlos Moya, who won a battle of over-30s as he ousted Swede Jonas Bjorkman 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, 7-5. Novak Djokovic lifted his clay game as he duplicated the best Grand Slam showing of his career, reaching the last eight 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1) over Fernando Verdasco. The Serb sixth seed joined female compatriots Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic in the last eight at Roland Garros as the second week began. Djokovic got this far in Paris last year, but was forced to retire with a lower back injury when trailing eventual champion Rafael Nadal 6-4, 6-4 in the quarters.

Scott Strazzante's Heart and Soul Bears' Tank Johnson gets 8-game suspension Published June 4, 2007, 2:34 PM CDT Your next glimpse of Tank Johnson in a Bears uniform will come on Nov. 11 at Oakland after the defensive lineman was suspended by the NFL for the first eight games of the 2007 season. If Johnson is as serious about changing his life as he said he was after a two-month stay in Cook County Jail, his suspension could be reduced to six games if he meets certain conditions set by the league and commissioner Roger Goodell. Tank Johnson's 8-game suspension is ... Tank's for coming: Who visited Johnson in jail A look at who visited Tank in jail Suspect denied bail in slaying of Bears player's bodyguard Suspect charged in Ice Bar slaying Shelter takes Bears player's pit bull Charges loom in club death Johnson takes big step forward Ditka: Bears should have dumped Tank Judge to Tank: Go home. Do not stop for dinner. Bears' Johnson harassed before pal slain in club Bears coach Lovie Smith is expected to issue a statement later Monday. Johnson has emerged from a dark period which included jail time and the death of his best friend Willie B. Posey the night after a Dec. 14 police raid on his Gurnee home. "One day I want to be the face of the league for guys who have come through adversity and ultimately become the Man of the Year in the NFL," Johnson said in May following his release from jail. "That would be a tremendous ending to this story. That's something I'm striving for. I would love to do that." The defensive tackle met with the NFL commissioner in May to plead his case. "Mr. Goodell has a tremendous responsibility to get this league in order," Johnson said. "Whatever he decides to do, it's in the best interest of the league, and I feel like whatever sanction he imposes, I'm man enough to take it. Once I get back on the field, I know that chapter of my life is closed and I can move on with a sense of closure." While Johnson was in jail, Bears veterans began their off-season strength and conditioning program and rookies went through the draft and a mini-camp of their own. "As much as anything, Tank now has a starting spot," Smith said last month. "He has a long way to go. As a football team, we have a long way to go. But Tank'll catch up." That catching up will start in Oakland.

Sports - Hockey - NHL Play Offs Senator feels 'pretty good' Mon, June 4, 2007 QUOTE OF THE DAY Senator feels 'pretty good' McAmmond still game-time decision Senators Dean McAmmond is helped off the ice after a hit from the Ducks Chris Pronger in Game 3 on Saturday. Pronger was suspended for one game for the hit on Sunday. (CP PHOTO/Ryan Remiorz) Was Pronger fairly punished? Sens look to ride momentum Dean McAmmond went for a bike ride this morning. Then, the injured Senators centre went for a light 35-minute skate. Will he play tonight in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup final? Anaheim coach Randy Carlyle said he wouldn't be shocked to see McAmmond make a miracle recovery from the concussion he suffered after taking an elbow to the head in Game 3 from Chris Pronger. "Nothing would surprise me, it's playoffs. People make huge strides in their recovery after suspensions. It's amazing," said Carlyle, who is still smarting after Pronger was suspended by NHL VP Colin Campbell for the hit. Pronger will miss tonight's Game 4 at Scotiabank Place (8 p.m., CBC). But that won't be decided until McAmmond and coach Bryan Murray have had a chance to consult with the club's doctors. McAmmond said he's doing a lot better than he thought he would. "I actually feel pretty good. I'm just going to continue on with my day and see how I feel. I'd like to be in the lineup and there's a chance, but if you rush yourself it could happen again. I'm looking at it like I'm going to be back in tonight," said McAmmond. "If I feel confident I can compete at 100%, then I'll go. But, I don't want to be out there and not feeling confident enough to help this team win." Ottawa coach Bryan Murray won't take any chances if there's a risk of further injury. "We have to talk to the doctors before we let him play, but he's trying," said Murray. "We'd like to let him play, but talking to him he's certainly not 100% at this moment. Murray said it's likely to be a game-time decision, and could even be delayed until after the pre-game skate. "We'll wait. We'll talk to the trainers after. I want Dr. (Don) Chow and whoever works with him in that area to give me the green light. I don't want to put the player in if there's any chance of taking a risk." If McAmmond can't play tonight, it's expected Patrick Eaves would step into the lineup in his place. Eaves himself lost his roster spot, to Oleg Sparykin, after being injured early in the playoffs. The Ducks won't have Pronger, but McAmmond said whether he plays or not, he's not worried about speculation that he could be faking or exaggerating the degree of the injury. "People can think that if they want. It's up to them really," said McAmmond. "I guess it depends on the person and how they react to the incident. You should look at the hit and judge it by the flagrancy there. It doesn't matter if the guy is up the next minute or out the whole year." The Ducks lead the best-of-seven 2-1 in games. Game 5 will be back in Anaheim on Wednesday. Has the NHL done the right thing by suspending Chris Pronger for one game? It should be longer He shouldn't be suspended at all
http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/12-0&fd=R&url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/06/03/ap3782736.html&cid=1116896701&ei=iIBkRsmSMY6WrgOdh4DPBQ Bard Knocks in 4 Runs to Lift Padres - Forbes.com Bard Knocks in 4 Runs to Lift Padres 06.03.07, 5:50 PM ET David Wells decried the deplorable conditions in which he labored, while Josh Bard tried to make the best of the wet situation. Wells threw five solid innings in the rain, Bard homered and drove in a career-high four runs and the San Diego Padres beat the Washington Nationals 7-3 on Sunday. "Terrible, terrible and even worse," Wells said when asked to assess the playing conditions as the teams played in persistent precipitation. Had the game been postponed, the best makeup option would have been a Monday afternoon game on what was supposed to be an off day for the Padres. "We just felt like people wanted to go home. They wanted to be home on the off day," said Bard, whose team hosts the Los Angeles Dodgers for a three-game series beginning Tuesday. "We're just excited getting out of here taking two of three." Since being suspended three games for his actions in a physical encounter with umpires in Pittsburgh on Thursday - when his apparent home run was reversed and ruled a double - Bard is 5-for-9 with two doubles, a homer and six RBIs. Washington's Austin Kearns had to make a running catch on the warning track in right field on Bard's seventh-inning sacrifice fly, which came with the bases loaded. "He's swinging the bat better," Padres manager Bud Black said. "He would have had a real big game if Kearns hadn't made the play against him." Bard's three-run homer gave the Padres a first-inning lead, and Hiram Bocachica's solo homer - his first hit since being claimed on waivers from Oakland on Thursday - snapped a fifth-inning tie. Wells (3-3) prospered in terrible weather conditions to win for the second time in seven starts. The left-hander allowed three runs on five hits, walked none and struck out two as the Padres won for the seventh time in nine games. Ryan Zimmerman homered for the Nationals, who fell to 6-22 against the Padres since August 2003. Steady, and sometimes heavy, rain eventually turned a drizzle by the seventh inning, as the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry passed through the mid-Atlantic. Sandbags greeted early arrivals in the dugouts, water collected between first and second bases, and the grounds crew repeatedly spread drying compound on the soggy infield. "You were lucky to have a dry ball at any given time," Wells said. "It was terrible. I'm glad we played, but I don't know why we should. Somebody could have gotten hurt." After Marcus Giles singled, Terrmel Sledge reached on a bunt single when no one covered first and Bard hit a one-out homer to right off Jason Simontacchi's 0-1 pitch for a 3-0 lead. "When you throw into his swing pattern, he's going to hit the ball hard. ... You try to hit your spots, and obviously, down and in isn't a good spot," Simontacchi said. Washington tied it in the third on Zimmerman's homer. Nook Logan singled, went to second on a sacrifice, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Ronnie Belliard's double. Zimmerman then crushed his team-leading eighth home run, a mammoth shot that landed a third of the way up in the left-field upper deck. "They told me where it went. Thats pretty far up there, I guess," Zimmerman said. Simontacchi (2-4) retired 12 straight after Bard's homer before Bocachica connected with one out in the fifth. A throwing error by Zimmerman led to two more unearned runs and Simontacchi's departure. Marcus Giles reached on Zimmerman's error and Sledge walked before Adrian Gonzalez extended his hitting streak to 10 games with a two-run double to right for a 6-3 lead. Simontacchi gave up six runs - four earned - on five hits over 4 2-3 innings. He walked one and struck out four. "I thought he pitched decent," Nationals manager Manny Acta said. "He got hurt by the miscues behind him. He made a couple of mistakes, costly ones. He made a couple of mistakes (but) we didn't play well behind him." Notes:@ OF Mike Cameron was a late scratch from the Padres' lineup because of a tight hamstring. Bocachica took over for Cameron in center field, while Bard moved into his cleanup spot. Cameron flew out as a pinch-hitter in the ninth. ... The Nationals signed 17-year-old Dominican SS Luis Castillo to a professional contract Sunday. ... San Diego 3B Kevin Kouzmanoff was hit in the right shoulder by a Simontacchi pitch in the fourth, but plate umpire Bob Davidson ruled the pitch a ball because Kouzmanoff didn't try to avoid it.

Foyt 225, could have taken it easy and settled for a top-10 finish. The 32-year old Brazilian was in a sour mood, his race seemingly ruined by a poorly-timed full-course caution that came out when banged wheels in Turn 1 while disputing fourth place. The yellow flag was bad news for TK because he had to pit for fuel. The pits were closed, but Kanaan had no choice but to peel off for a splash. His mood didn't improve when he was brought back in again because he somehow ended up three gallons short of a full tank. "I wasn't a very happy camper at that point, and I forget that people monitor our radios," Kanaan said. "I told my team to get their stuff together, although I used a different term. "Of course, the next time I came in, I missed my mark, I hit a bump and almost ran my guy over. And for sure, payback comes. They told me to get my stuff together. So we came to the agreement that the last stop would be a good one, and it was." In the subsequent stint, the 7-Eleven car moved from fifth to second between Laps 169 and 197. Helio Castroneves' two-second lead began to dwindle, but then in a highly atypical failure, his rear wing flopped down exiting Turn 4 four laps later and the Team Penske car snapped into a spin, coming to rest straddling the start/finish line after clouting the inside wall nose first. "I had that thing won," Castroneves declared. "There's no way I wasn't going to win that race unless something very unusual happened &#133; and it did. I just have to laugh it off." .'s car looked ready to suffer a similar failure later in the race, dropping the defending IndyCar Series champion to ninth place a lap down. "We'll have to see what happened," said Penske Racing President Tim Cindric. "Those were brand-new parts on both cars, no different to what we have always used." Castroneves' demise completed Kanaan's rise to the top, and he duly reeled off the last 11 green-flag laps to win by 2.51 seconds over Indy 500 champion Dario Franchitti. It was Kanaan's second consecutive victory at the Milwaukee Mile. "After the pit stop, I knew it was going to be a long day," Kanaan said. "But I didn't panic. I said, 'Well, I've got to pass 11 cars now.' "I knew I had a good car, but when you put yourself back there, anything can happen. I was just trying to stay out of trouble." Franchitti's second-place finish moved the Scotsman into the lead of the IndyCar Series standings by three points over Kanaan, his Andretti Green teammate. But AGR's star performance Sunday was turned in by Patrick, who made up a lap and finished eighth after her Lap 89 clash with Wheldon. Danica got a run on Franchitti and Wheldon when they got balked in traffic coming off Turn 4. She made it cleanly by Franchitti on the pit straight and tried to slip inside Wheldon entering Turn 1, but the Ganassi driver turned in, bumping Patrick's car into a lazy slide through the infield grass. I'm not racing to be famous or to go make the news. The prize money check is mine, the trophy is mine, and I've got 50 points in the bank. I'm going for the championship, so if they want to make the front page of USA Today, be my guest. She subsequently had to pit to have a steering arm replaced and drove well to claim eighth place at the flag. After the race, Patrick marched down to the Ganassi Racing pit to confront Wheldon, and after a short, animated conversation, she shoved the Englishman before stalking away. "It seems to me Dan got passed," Patrick said. "I told him if he thinks I won't remember this, he's crazy." Responded Wheldon, who finished fourth behind his teammate : "She's a little disgruntled, but what goes around comes around. She nearly put me in the pit wall at Indianapolis, and I certainly don't have any problem with anyone else on the track. "She's probably feeling the pressure of not winning races when her teammates are," Wheldon added. "It's unfortunate for her, but she's just being Danica. She'll be fine when she calms down. But she's messing with the wrong person if she wants to get feisty." The Dan vs. Danica contretemps livened up what was generally a pretty dull show by IndyCar standards. Castroneves led 126 of 201 laps before his retirement and looked like he had things comfortably under control. But then again, Kanaan thought he had things under control at Indianapolis, where he led 83 of the 166 laps that were run, but lost his chance to win when pit-stop strategy stuck him midpack in the path of a spinning backmarker. And the Patrick/Wheldon confrontation pulled the spotlight off of Kanaan after his victory. But he wasn't complaining. "I'm not racing to be famous or to go make the news," he said. "The prize-money check is mine, the trophy is mine, and I've got 50 points in the bank. I'm going for the championship, so if they want to make the front page of USA Today, be my guest. "Maybe one day if I feel I need some attention, I'll just get out of the car and beat the hell out of somebody," he added with a chuckle. "Then we'll make the front page for sure."

Hamilton was taken to Lutheran Hospital by ambulance at around 5:45 a.m. Saturday, according to the team. He was diagnosed with gastroenteritis, which is an inflammation or infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Hamilton, who returned to the team hotel to rest, was not in the starting lineup Saturday night against the Indians and was listed as day-to-day. His condition was not viewed as serious, but he still was in the team hotel recovering when Saturday's game started, team spokesman Rob Butcher said. "It's a bad stomachache, and he might have eaten 10 hot dogs," joked Reds manager Jerry Narron. In 37 games this season, Hamilton is batting .261 with eight home runs and 18 RBIs. The National League's Rookie of the Month in April, the 25-year-old Hamilton was 4-for-11 (.364) in his last three games. But he is in a 5-for-34 (.147) slump over his last 11 games. Hamilton went 0-for-2 in Friday's 9-4 loss after he entered as a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning. Reds ace Aaron Harang arrived in Cleveland on Saturday and is expected to make his scheduled start in the series finale Sunday against the Indians. Harang has been on bereavement leave since Thursday to be with his ailing grandfather in San Diego. Harang, who pitched nine innings during a 2-1, 12-inning win on Tuesday against San Diego, kept with his regular throwing routine while working out at San Diego State University. Narron believes everything will be normal for the pitcher on Sunday. "If he's not normal, I don't expect him to make an excuse," Narron said. "I'm sure he will not [make an excuse]. I expect him to pitch well." To make room for Harang on the 25-man roster, infielder Jeff Keppinger will be optioned back to Triple-A Louisville. Reliever Eddie Guardado's next live batting-practice session remained on hold Saturday because of a sore neck. Guardado had to scratch pitching on Friday, when his neck seized on him during warmups. The left-hander hopes to pitch in the bullpen on Monday. Top pitching prospect Homer Bailey, who has been out with a strained right groin, is eligible to return from the seven-day disabled list with Louisville on Sunday. Bailey, who missed one start, will likely be activated on Tuesday and take his regular turn in the rotation against Columbus. He was injured during his last start on May 12 and was shelved as a precaution. With a runner on first in the second inning Friday, Norris Hopper bunted against Indians starter Cliff Lee and popped foul in an ugly first attempt. On the next pitch, however, Hopper executed a perfect drag bunt between the mound and first base. First baseman Ryan Garko fielded the ball, and Hopper easily beat Lee to first base for a single. "When I popped that one up foul, I wiped it out of my mind real fast," Hopper said. "No matter what, I was trying to bunt for a hit. I wasn't trying for a sac." Said Narron: "It was a good bunt. He showed that last year when he came here. One of the first things he did was bunt right away." Hopper started in left field Friday, when Adam Dunn served as the designated hitter. Hopper started in right field on Saturday, with Ken Griffey Jr. handling DH duties. The 28-year-old Hopper puts a lot of time in to work on his bunting. "Just as much as I do hitting," Hopper said. "I like to get moving before I bunt the ball so I get down the line fast. I usually try to make the first baseman field it and just beat the pitcher to the bag." Right-hander Paul Byrd (3-1, 3.49 ERA) will pitch for Cleveland against Harang (5-1, 4.42) in Sunday's 1:05 p.m. ET series finale. is a reporter for MLB.com.

As a man who once was surprised when a date ended suddenly just moments after I pointed out that the decline of Western civilization could be traced back to the moment when women got the right to vote, I have a hard time understanding some of the things that seem to bring out the craziness in our society. Call me old school (at my age, it&#8217;s hard to call me anything else), but I don&#8217;t see the harm in school prayer, I don't believe the government should have access to everything we think and do, and &#8212; although Paris Hilton is probably one of the biggest wastes of oxygen on the planet &#8212; I don&#8217;t think she should be going to jail over a traffic violation. The media coverage? Well, she brought that on herself. So when I heard that the Lords of Baseball had decided Sunday that Lou Pinella should be suspended &#8220;indefinitely&#8221; for kicking dirt on an umpire, I found myself wondering once again what the world had come to. Kicking dirt on an umpire? Until this weekend, I thought that was every manager&#8217;s God-given right. It&#8217;s something every baseball fan has dreamed of doing more than once, and, in fact, has probably done in his or her mind on a number of occasions. Piniella, who, despite having a reputation as one of baseball&#8217;s great minds, has been stupid enough to think he could make winners of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and, currently, the Chicago Cubs, didn&#8217;t spit on the umpire in question. He didn&#8217;t even poke him with the brim of his cap during a face-to-face over a play at third base that he later admitted the umpire got right. He KICKED DIRT ON HIM! Earl Weaver, who won championships with the Baltimore Orioles, and Billy Martin, who eventually wore out his welcome as a manager and a player at every stop he made during his career despite winning in every uniform he put on, could have filled dump trucks with the dirt they kicked on umpires during their long and illustrious careers. And not once did a baseball commissioner suspend them or even fine them. Piniella was a player for Martin and played against some of Weaver&#8217;s great Oriole teams, and, like those guys, he didn&#8217;t care about statistics or looking pretty on the field. He just came to beat you every day. In a lineup loaded with superstars, &#8220;Sweet Lou&#8221; was the guy every Yankee fan wanted at the plate when the game was on the line. He wasn&#8217;t the most physically gifted on any major league team he ever played for, but he did all the little things to help those clubs win. So with the Cubbies mired in one of those May losing streaks their fans have come to accept and just one day removed from a fist fight in the dugout between his catcher (Michael Barrett) and his best pitcher (Carlos Zambrano), Lou decided to shake things up. He picked a play right in front of his dugout that was close enough to bring him out to argue, and his perfectly orchestrated Piniella meltdown was shown to virtually every person in America who happened to see a news or sports report Saturday night. To the casual fan, Piniella&#8217;s organic assault on the umpire appeared to be pure insanity. He covered his shoes with dirt, he probably questioned his heritage a few times, and he even kicked his own hat around the hot corner. For Piniella, though, the play at third base simply provided an excuse for him to breathe a little life into a team that had already reached rock bottom early in a season when a lot of experts thought the Cubs &#8212; coming off an offseason when management had spent $100 million to sign a couple of high-profile free agents, including Alfonso Soriano, and keep a couple of other veterans &#8212; would contend for a division title. But these are, after all, the Cubs. They haven&#8217;t won a World Series in almost a century, they&#8217;ve won one division title in the last 20 years, and, in what is generally considered baseball&#8217;s weakest division (the NL Central), they hadn&#8217;t shown a spark all season. Soriano, a 40-40 guy in 2006, had just five home runs as May ended, the bullpen was in shambles, and the starters &#8212; especially Zambrano (who had gone 33-13 the past two seasons but was 5-5 with an ERA near six after he was bombed by the Braves Friday) &#8212; had underachieved. So Piniella did the only thing that remained. He tried to stir things up by stirring up a little dust, and the umpire simply got in the way. Baseball&#8217;s powers-that-be saw things differently, however. Guys who had never managed a team or played an inning in a professional uniform decided Piniella should pay for his indiscretion. A move that had been generally accepted in the major leagues since the late 19th century was suddenly seen as an unprovoked assault on an innocent official. Piniella, they decided, had embarrassed himself and the game by going nuts with the whole world watching. So, one day after the Cubbies responded to their manager&#8217;s apparent madness by clubbing the Braves (whose own manager, Bobby Cox, is nearing a major league record for ejections but hasn&#8217;t been suspended for any of them) Sunday afternoon, Piniella will be defending himself today and trying to get back in the dugout &#8212; the only place he's ever really belonged. As a lifelong St. Louis Cardinal fan, I have no love for the Cubs. As a baseball fan and a Lou Piniella fan, though, I have to cling to the hope that everything I&#8217;ve come to love about the game isn&#8217;t being chipped away one piece at a time and that baseball won&#8217;t become just another casualty of political correctness.

Wilmington, Delaware. Local News & Weather NASCAR eyes shifting spring '08 Dover races How the public lost its right to the beach State on track to set record for foreclosures Truex wins Autism Speaks 400 Nextel Cup race at Dover Posted Monday, June 4, 2007 at 3:36 pm Martin Truex celebrates in Victory Lane to get his first win at the Nextel Cup Series Autism Speaks 400 at Dover International Speedway. The News Journal/SUCHAT PEDERSON DOVER — Martin Truex Jr. earned his first career victory for Dale Earnhardt Inc., winning at Dover International Speedway today hours after the death of longtime NASCAR chairman Bill France Jr. Truex won for the first time in 58 career points races on what the New Jersey native has long considered his hometown track. He ended a dominant five-race winning streak for Hendrick Motorsports, leading 216 of the 400 laps on the Monster Mile in NASCAR’s Car of Tomorrow. Truex showed DEI just might be in good hands once coveted free-agent Dale Earnhardt Jr. leaves at season’s end. Now, for a few days at least, Truex can talk about his win instead of the latest Earnhardt rumors. “In times of change, and times when people don’t really know what’s going on and they need some direction, I am just happy to be the one in Victory Lane,” Truex said. “Couldn’t have come at a better race track. Just unbelievable, man.” But news of France’s death overshadowed the race. The flag at Victory Lane was lowered to half staff shortly after the announcement, and drivers paid tribute to the man who transformed NASCAR. Truex even was reminded over the radio by his crew to remember and honor France after the race. Certainly the day’s wait for the Autism 400 was worth it for Truex, now closing in on being one of the top 12 drivers for the Chase. He’s eight points behind Mark Martin, who’s 12th. The blowers were still out while the cars were out on the grid waiting for their pace laps. But the sun peeked out right as the green flag dropped, which led to a clear and clean day of racing. Pole sitter Ryan Newman, who led most of the first half of the race, was denied his first win since 2005 and finished second. Carl Edwards, who won the Busch Series race here on Saturday was third. “He definitely likes this racetrack, and that’s unfortunate for me,” Newman said. “Just to be up front all day and lead a lot of laps is a great feeling, even on a Monday.” Denny Hamlin and Matt Kenseth rounded out the top five. Hendrick Motorsports had won five straight races and nine of the past 10 Nextel Cup races, but only points lead Jeff Gordon (9th) finished in the top 10 at Dover. Casey Mears was 13th; Jimmie Johnson was 15th and Kyle Busch 17th. Gordon has a 152-point lead over Johnson in the points standings. Mears won the Coca-Cola 600 last week, giving Nextel Cup two first-time winners in consecutive races. It was the first time the series had consecutive first-time winners since Tony Stewart and Joe Nemechek in 1999. Truex had not seen his success on the Busch Series circuit — consecutive championships in 2004 and 2005 before joining DEI’s Cup team — carry over into Cup. But he gained momentum two weeks ago when he won the Nextel Open at Charlotte and earned a spot in the in NASCAR’s All-Star race. Earnhardt hoped to turn a second-place qualifying effort into his first win of the season but instead was plagued by tire woes, dropped four laps back at one point and finished 22nd. Earnhardt congratulated Truex in Victory Lane, telling his teammate that he knew he could win. “He’s been a great friend, and I’ll see him at the house tonight,” Truex said. “We’re going to have some fun.” For complete NASCAR coverage, see The News Journal and - Mon Jun 04, 2007 5:01 pm R.I.P.

To make room for them, the Reds plan to send right-hander Brad Salmon and outfielder Dewayne Wise to Louisville. Hamilton was the National League's rookie of the month in April. He has been on the disabled list since May 22 after a bout with gastroenteritis that flared up during a series in Cleveland. He was hitting .261 with eight home runs and 18 RBIs then, and hit .333 with four home runs in six rehab appearances with the Bats. Coffey began the season with the Reds and was 1-1 with a 4.94 ERA in 26 relief appearances before he was optioned to Louisville on May 24. He did not allow a run in six appearances for the Bats, striking out nine in 5 2-3 innings. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Coast to Coast Imports Quality Luxury Imports BMWs, Lexus, Mercedes only at Coast to Coast View all Top Car Deals WEST ALLIS, Wis. -- If Danica Patrick wants to get tough with Dan Wheldon, the former Indianapolis 500 winner is ready for it. Good job, pal: Indy Racing League race winner Tony Kanaan (left) is congratulated by third-place finisher Dan Wheldon. Wheldon and Danica Patrick made contact during the race, each blaming the other. "Maybe it's inexperience on her part," he said. - Greg Griffo / The Star Learjet 550 at Fort Worth, Texas 9:30 p.m. Saturday; ESPN2 coverage begins at 10 p.m. Patrick chastised Wheldon for contact between the two in Sunday's Indy-car race at the Milwaukee Mile. Patrick ended the post-race exchange on pit road by grabbing Wheldon's elbow and shoving him. The Patrick-Wheldon scuffle and ensuing war of words overshadowed Tony Kanaan's race victory. "If she wants to get feisty," Wheldon said afterward, "I'm a lot tougher than her on the track." Patrick blamed Wheldon for turning down on her entering the first turn of the 89th lap of the ABC Supply/A.J. Foyt 225. She had passed Wheldon and Indianapolis 500 winner Dario Franchitti in the previous corner, and they were in a three-wide sprint down the front straightaway for fourth place. Franchitti recognized the danger of the situation and pulled his car back from the potential mess. Knowing excess tire debris was in the high lane, Wheldon sought to avoid it, but Patrick's car was inside him. Patrick's right front tire banged into Wheldon's left rear tire, and the contact sent her sliding into the infield. She kept the car from wall contact, but a piece of her steering mechanism had to be replaced on pit road, costing her a lap to the leaders. Patrick scrambled back to finish eighth -- Wheldon ended up third -- but she felt she deserved more, and Wheldon was her target. "I don't know if he has tunnel vision, but this is racing and a pass is a pass," she said angrily. "Did anyone see the replay?" Patrick said she asked Wheldon about his move on several occasions but did not get much of an answer. That's what prompted the shove, she said. "I'm not sure what is lost in translation (with him)," she said. Patrick said she expected Indy Racing League officials to penalize Wheldon, but it could be Patrick who gets a reaction from competition director Brian Barnhart. This was the second time Patrick has made physical contact with a fellow competitor following a race. She shoved Jaques Lazier following their crash at California Speedway in 2005. Barnhart said Wheldon would not be penalized, and he will review Patrick's behavior on pit road. "It looked like one of those racing deals," Barnhart said. "(Wheldon) has to turn down and if it's two-wide, he's expecting (Patrick) to turn down, too. "This was a result of close competition, and I don't feel like that's worth a penalty on the racetrack. Dan didn't want to have contact." Patrick didn't let the issue drop. She said Wheldon was mad that she passed him during the 500, and she called him stubborn when she approached him Sunday. "If he thinks I'm not going to remember that . . . ," she said. Wheldon insisted Patrick wasn't alongside him entering the corner, and he said her reaction shows she's feeling the pressure of never having won a major race, including 36 in Indy cars. Patrick is the only driver on the Andretti Green Racing team without a victory. Wheldon, a Ganassi Racing driver who previously drove for AGR, has won 13 of his 69 IRL races, including the 2005 Indy 500 en route to the season championship. "I've been around long enough to know when someone's inside me," he said. "Maybe it's inexperience on her part." Patrick had been the star of the race prior to the contact, driving from 17th on the starting grid to fourth place with speed and timely moves. She had a pair of two-car passes in the same corner. The first was on Buddy Rice and Scott Dixon in the fourth turn on lap 64 to get her to sixth place. Kanaan led 37 of the 225 laps for a victory that was a nice consolation prize to last week's disappointing 12th-place finish at Indy. But there was too much action Sunday to allow him the spotlight. Helio Castroneves, who led 126 laps, crashed by himself off the fourth turn on lap 201 when his rear wing mount broke. Sam Hornish Jr. was chasing Kanaan with six laps to go when his rear wing bracket broke, too. Marco Andretti crashed for the third time in the past four races, a second-turn slap on lap 210. Franchitti, the Indy winner, finished second to take the points lead heading to Saturday night's race at Texas Motor Speedway. Call Star reporter Curt Cavin at (317) 444-6409.

BOSTON - Roger Clemens could make his Yankees debut on Saturday in the Bronx, but the Yankees aren't making anything official until they get the results of today's MRI on his groin. Clemens was examined yesterday in Tampa by Dr. Allen Miller. Miller decided an MRI was necessary to determine the extent of Clemens' "fatigued right groin," the injury that caused the Rocket to be scratched from tonight's start in Chicago. "(Miller) wants to get a feel for what we're dealing with and the only real way to do that is to get an MRI," GM Brian Cashman said. "Until we get the MRI, we'd just be guessing. I just know Roger is optimistic." Clemens feels he will be able to start for the Yankees on Saturday against the Pirates, a sentiment echoed by a hopeful Joe Torre before last night's game. "We're not scheduling, but we're tentatively looking at possibly next weekend," Torre said. "We certainly don't want him to say, 'I can pitch with this.' That's not something we want; it's too important that he goes out there every five days to just have one start, and then maybe we don't have him." "He feels that the sure thing is that instead of (today), he can slot in the next time," Cashman said. "He's optimistic about that, that's all I can communicate." The Yankees will give Matt DeSalvo the ball tonight in Clemens' place, recalling the 26-year-old in place of first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz, who is expected to be out six to eight weeks after his collision with Mike Lowell on Saturday. DeSalvo was 1-2 with a 5.40 ERA in five games, four of them starts, before being sent down to Triple-A on Friday. Cashman indicated that he has no plans to back out of Clemens' contract, which the Yankees could opt to do since it is a nonguaranteed, minor-league deal. There is no language in the prorated $28 million pact that requires the Yankees to call him up to the majors, but Cashman believes that Clemens can help his team make a run at the postseason. "I want to have a healthy Roger Clemens, when he's ready, to assist this team, because we still have a shot," Cashman said. "We're not out of it and we feel he can have a big impact." Despite the hype and buildup that accompanied Clemens' anticipated return tonight - including shifting the start time an hour back to 7 p.m. Eastern time to accomodate national television - Torre said he and his players have had more to concern themselves with this weekend than Clemens' status. "We've had a habit of never counting our chickens until they show up," Torre said. "Especially here in Boston, we're not looking forward to (today) when we have work to do here. We never got to the point of feeling he was here."

He has never had to deal with a rut against the Florida Marlins. Hudson looks to remain unbeaten against the Marlins when he takes the mound for the Atlanta Braves on Monday night in the opener of a four-game series at Turner Field. Hudson (6-3, 2.77 ERA) had lost two straight starts before Wednesday, when he allowed two runs and six hits in seven innings to beat Milwaukee 9-3. A matchup with Florida (27-30) gives the right-hander a good chance to build some momentum. Hudson is 1-0 with a 2.40 ERA in two starts against the Marlins this season, and 5-0 with a 2.10 ERA in nine career starts against them. Hudson has never allowed more than three earned runs in a start versus Florida. Atlanta (32-24) couldn't complete a three-game sweep against the Chicago Cubs over the weekend. Starter Lance Cormier gave up eight runs in four innings as the Braves lost 10-1 on Sunday. Atlanta pitchers had surrendered just 12 earned runs in their previous five games. The Braves' lineup also couldn't get much going Sunday after scoring 22 runs in its previous three contests. Andrew Jones, however, went 1-for-4 to extend his season-best hitting streak to nine games. He is hitting .306 (11-for-36) with three home runs, three doubles and seven RBIs during his streak to raise his average slightly from .213 to .230. ''His approach to the ball just wasn't what I'd like to see or what I've seen when he's been successful,'' Atlanta hitting coach Terry Pendleton told the team's Web site. ''His approach is a lot better right now. That makes a difference with the way he keeps his balance when he attacks a baseball.'' The Braves will try to bounce back against Marlins starter Web Obermueller (1-3, 5.02 ERA), who is getting the ball on three days' rest. The right-hander was moved up in the rotation because Sergio Mitre is still nursing a hamstring injury. In his last start, Obermueller allowed three runs and six hits while striking out five in seven innings as Florida lost 4-3 to Milwaukee on Thursday night. He has never had less than four days of rest in between starts in his major league career. ''I'm excited to go,'' Obermueller said. ''In the past, I've pitched like that in relief and went like three innings and went a couple of days later for a spot start. This will be the quickest turnaround, going seven innings and then going four days later.'' Obermueller was with Milwaukee when he made his only career appearance against the Braves, surrendering seven runs and seven hits in 4 1-3 innings in a 7-1 loss on Aug. 7, 2003. Florida lost three of four in Milwaukee after winning its previous six games on the road. The Marlins lost the finale of their series with the Brewers 3-0 on Sunday, getting shut out for the third time this season. The Marlins lead the season series with the Braves 3-2, splitting two games in a rain-shortened series in Atlanta from April 13-15. The teams will make up a game as part of a doubleheader Tuesday.

Spaniard? It’s called the French War Quijano: Cebuano mixed martial artist kicks in Taekwondo kickin’ up in region Sayson: Cavs beat Detroit Cebu tankers reign in Bohol Tuesday, June 05, 2007 Sayson: Cavs beat Detroit - Anthony Maglunsod, a 31-year-old CPA who works at Pag-ibig Fund Cebu, asked “what is your take on this latest Kobe Bryant saga?” Even if the Lakers grant Kobe’s wishes, it would be extremely difficult to trade him because he has four years and $88 million left on his seven-year, $136.4 million contract. Pinoy Votes: Sun.Star Election 2007 Coverage I sympathize with Kobe’s trade demands, which anchored on his desire to win. But he should not have made those demands in public. Prior to last night’s Game 6 of the East Conference Finals at the Quicken Loans Arena, Lebron James told his teammates to just “Take me to the fourth quarter and I will carry you home.” The Cavs took James to the fourth quarter with a slim 67-66 lead. But Lebron didn’t have to take them home. Playing with a poise and cold-hearted maturity beyond his 21 years, Gibson scored 31 points on 5-of-5 shooting from 3-point range. A rookie, Gibson also drilled 12 of 15 free throws. After skyrocketing to playoffs greatness with a transcendent 48 points in Game 5, Lebron fell back to earth with a mere 20 points, 14 rebounds, and 8 assists. This time, James was a facilitator and not the prolific scorer that he was when the Cavs stole Game 5 at the Palace in Detroit 48 hours earlier. It was Gibson’s turn to create a chapter in his legend. In the crucible of a series clincher, Gibson fired 19 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter. He also sank four of five of his triples in those last 12 minutes, including the dagger that gave Cleveland an 86-71 bubble with 6:52 to play. As Cleveland made the finishing touches of their improbable playoffs run, the veteran Pistons improbably melted under pressure. Rasheed Wallace lost his temper and was ejected following two technical foul calls with 7:44 remaining and the Cavs cruising along toward their first ever trip to the NBA Finals since the franchise joined the league in 1971. I pick Detroit to win this series and advance to their third NBA Finals appearance in five years. It was an easy choice given Detroit’s experience and firepower. I have doubted Cleveland to make a serious run because I thought there was not enough talent around LeBron James. But how wrong I was. The Cavaliers demonstrated a cohesiveness that I thought they never had. They avoided Detroit’s traps wisely, they passed the ball around, and they showed a lot of toughness by out-rebounding Detroit 51-38. I already had a hotel reservation for my Finals trip supposedly to Detroit but last night I had to frantically cancel that reservation and scamper for a hotel room accommodation for one week somewhere in downtown Cleveland, where the Cavs will host the Spurs in Games 3, 4, and 5. When the 2006-2007 season began last November, I have consistently picked he Spurs to win it all. I am not about to change now. Even with LeBron’s greatness, Gibson’s coming out party, and the Cavs’ newfound confidence, I have unbridled faith in Tim Duncan and the mighty San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs will win the 2007 NBA Finals in six. With a game left to play, Green is a sure win WITH one more event left to play, the Green Team has virtually annexed the overall championship title after earning 155 points to lord over three other teams in the 2007 Sun.Star Cebu Sportsfest. After scoring 90 points in the opening day by winning the mixed volleyball and the men’s and women’s badminton events, the Green Team collected an additional 65 points to pull away from a tough competition with only the bowling event to play this Sunday. Pinoy Votes: Sun.Star Election 2007 Coverage Green men’s table tennis team composed of Sun.Star’s vice president for marketing JJ Neri, Greg Fernandez and Mike Limpag won the table tennis men’s title after lording over the Red Team composed of Allan Defensor, Dongdong Ygay and Joseph Tubilan in the finals to earn 20 more points. The women’s table tennis team settled for second place finishes along with the darts team and the chess squad. After surviving a cruel game in the elimination round against Orange, Maya Saroza and Ruby Opina of the HRD fell to the prowess of managing editor Isolde Amante and Logane Echavez of Blue Team in the finals. However, it will be a close quarter battle between the Blue and the Red Teams for the second place. Blue, which had three first place titles (darts, chess and women’s table tennis), earned a total of 110 points while the Reds trailed at 105 points. Orange is lagging behind at fourth place with 70 points. The Blue team also finished second in the women’s badminton doubles, third in the men’s badminton doubles and fourth in volleyball and men’s table tennis while Red were second in volleyball and men’s table tennis, third in women’s badminton, darts and women’s table tennis and fourth in chess. In the bowling event 50 points will go to the first placer, 40 the second, 30 to the third and 20 will go to the fourth placers. 10 senatorial winners to be proclaimed Wednesday Cebu guv pledges P5 million for Lahug US advisory warns v. travel in North Cotabato Church leads rally against Lanao canvassing © Copyright 2007 Sun.Star Publishing, Inc.

DOVER, Del.- Martin Truex Jr. earned his first career victory for Dale Earnhardt Inc., winning at Dover International Speedway on Monday hours after the death of longtime NASCAR chairman Bill France Jr. Truex won for the first time in 58 career points races on what the New Jersey native has long considered his hometown track. He ended a dominant five-race winning streak for Hendrick Motorsports, leading 216 of the 400 laps on the Monster Mile in NASCAR's Car of Tomorrow. But news of France's death overshadowed the race. The flag at victory lane was lowered to half staff shortly after the announcement, and drivers paid tribute to the man who transformed NASCAR. Truex was reminded over the radio by his crew to remember and honor France after the race. Certainly the day's wait for the Autism 400 was worth it for Truex, now closing in on being one of the top 12 drivers for the Chase. The blowers were still out while the cars were out on the grid waiting for their pace laps. But the sun peeked out right as the green flag dropped, which led to a clear and clean day of racing. Pole sitter Ryan Newman, who led most of the first half of the race, was denied his first win since 2005 and finished second. Carl Edwards, who won the Busch Series race here on Saturday was third. Denny Hamlin and Matt Kenseth rounded out the top five. Hendrick Motorsports had won five straight races and nine of the past 10 Nextel Cup races, but only Jeff Gordon (9th) finished in the top 10 at Dover. Casey Mears was 13th; Jimmie Johnson was 15th and Kyle Busch 17th. Mears won the Coca-Cola 600 last week, giving Nextel Cup two first-time winners in consecutive races. Truex had not seen his success on the Busch Series circuit&mdash;consecutive championships in 2004 and 2005 before joining DEI&mdash;carry over into Cup. But he gained momentum two weeks ago when he won the Nextel Open at Charlotte and earned a spot in the in NASCAR's All-Star race. Dale Earnhardt Jr. hoped to turn a second-place qualifying effort into his first win of the season but instead was plagued by tire woes, dropped four laps back at one point, and finished 22nd.

Patrick, one of two women in Sunday's ABC Supply/A.J. Foyt 225 at the Milwaukee Mile, had an on-track collision with the car driven by Dan Wheldon and then made a beeline for the Englishman in the pits after coming back to finish eighth. The incident took place on the 88th of 225 laps, with Patrick, who started 17th in the 18-car field, diving low on the track in an attempt to pass both Wheldon and last week's Indy 500 winner Dario Franchitti for fourth place. She got past Franchitti with no problem and appeared close to passing Wheldon when the two cars came together, sending Patrick's car spinning into the infield grass. She made a great save, straightening out her car and getting back on track as the yellow flag came out. The collision bent Patrick's suspension and forced a long pit stop for repairs, costing her a lap that she eventually made up with pit strategy and a timely late caution. Wheldon's car was not damaged and he went on to finish third, behind winner Tony Kanaan and Franchitti. The postrace conversation between Patrick and Wheldon was a pretty one-sided, with Patrick doing most of the talking and eventually giving her rival a light push as she walked away. "I just came up to him, looked up at him, put my arm around him, started walking and said, "What happened. What was that for? Did you not see me? Why didn't you back off?' And he didn't say anything," Patrick explained. "I said, "I was clearly inside you' because I heard him saying in an interview that I wasn't all the way up alongside of him. I'm not sure what is lost in translation there, but I was completely alongside of him. I've made many more passes happen with being less far up in someone. "Then he said, "You can't get caught up in the marbles' and I said, "Well, that's a pass Dan.' I told him, "If you don't think I'm going to remember this, I don't know why you're being like this, but if you don't think I'm going to remember, you're crazy,"' she added. Wheldon didn't see the on-track incident the same way as Patrick. "She obviously thought she was past me," he said. "She wasn't. I've been in this business long enough to know when someone is there and when somebody is not. Maybe it's a bit of inexperience there on her part." As for the postrace confrontation, he said, "She's just feisty. There's a lot of pressure on her because she has not won a race and her teammates are (winning). I think in a situation like that, sometimes you get desperate. ... She's just being Danica. She'll be fine when she calms down." WING WOES: Both Team Penske entries in Sunday's race had damaging late-race problems with their rear wing. Helio Castroneves had an almost certain victory snatched away when his rear wing collapsed and he crashed with 25 laps to go, while teammate Sam Hornish Jr. was in second place when his rear wing came loose, forcing him to pit with six laps to go and costing him a second-place finish. "I had the race won," said Castroneves, who led four times for a race-high 126 laps. "It's a shame that something so odd happened there at the end. The car just started spinning when my rear wing broke. It's unfortunate because our car was fantastic all day. It was getting better and better throughout the race. "I just have to laugh it off. It's amazing that I have such bad luck at this place. Now we just have to forget abut this and move on to Texas (for a race next Saturday night)." Hornish, the reigning series champion, was just as disappointed. "Today was a tough day for all of Team Penske," he said. "This is the same problem that Helio had. It's pretty strange that this happened to either one of us, let alone both of us. It's the kind of thing that almost never happens. "It's pretty frustrating since we both had a chance to win the race." Hornish wound up a lap down in ninth, while Castroneves wound up 16th. SPARKPLUGS: Team owner A.J. Foyt was the grand marshall Sunday and put a slightly different twist on the traditional prerace words, saying, "Girls and boys, start your engines." ... Despite an 80 percent chance of rain, 31,838 people turned out for the race. The rain never fell until an hour after the finish. ... Franchitti took the series lead and goes to Texas with a three-point edge on Wheldon and five on Scott Dixon, who went into the race as the leader. Copyright 2007 Associated Press.

Rate or reply to this comment on Sun Jun 03, 2007 10:48 pm Until you actually win a race (or come close like say finish second at least) just shut up Dannica. Quit blaming everyone and everything else for your misfortune. Wheldon has so much more cred than she has, if not the salary.

Rate or reply to this comment Another case of...it is what it is. on Sun Jun 03, 2007 11:16 pm This is what Danica is going to face her entire career. Being the only woman in a male dominated sport, she is going to have to deal with some b.s. and keep her mouth shut. I like Danica. Don't get me wrong. What she's doing is great, and she's an outstanding role model for alot of young girls. BUT....she also need to respect that Dan Wheldon is a top driver....and that he seems to have a bit of a problem with her. If I were Danica.....i would have just calmed down, kept my mouth shut....and put wheldon in the wall next week. Here is the difference between Tony Stewart and Dale Earnhardt Sr. Hated and loved just because of how they use their mouths. Rate or reply to this comment on Sun Jun 03, 2007 11:16 pm Sounds like Wheldon had the corner and Danifraud, who's usually timid in traffic, tried to force the issue (trying to prove something?) and - once again - screwed up. She's a jerk - put a guy in that car and let's stop this PC crap.

Rate or reply to this comment What does she want? on Mon Jun 04, 2007 09:02 am It seems that danica Patrick has been reading her own press clippings and thinks that the other drivers are supposed to give position on the track. Whinig about getting bumped is bush league and is a sign of someone that is maybe looking for excuses. Danica never wins and it's never her fault: last year it was the team she was with, this year it's the boys won't give her what she wants on the track. And how lame was that going up to Wheldon, throwing a hissy fit, and then pushing him? If that had been two guys, there might have been fisticuffs, but with it being Danica she can act like a petulant little brat and get by with it. If Wheldon does or says anything to her, he gets excoriated in the press for it, so it's not so impressive to go trying to push him around.

I watched the race, thank you. Can any of you nine drive that type of car over 190 MPH? I seriously doubt that as well. Research Danica's driving before she arrived to the IRL. Again thank you...

Six-time Superbike champion Mat Mladin and 2006 Superbike champ Ben Spies--teammates for Yoshimura Suzuki--traded victories in the title class while Erion Honda Racing teammates Josh Hayes and Aaron Gobert took top honors in the Formula Xtreme and Supersport classes, respectively. Spies added a Superstock win for good measure. Dunlop brought 2000 tires to support the factory and support teams of Agusta, Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha. One of the racersâ€™ favorite tracks, Road Americaâ€™s 4.048-mile combination of twisting turns, changing elevation and high-speed straights puts a tremendous load on rear tires, especially in the center portion of the tread. In addition to Dunlopâ€™s multi-compound N-Tecâ„¢ rear tire, all of the companyâ€™s rain tire designs proved not only to be up to the task, but also to have the measure of the competition. All of the race winners were on Dunlops, as were 11 of the 15 podium finishers in all five competitions. At the checkered flag, 82 percent of the top 10 finishers in all five races combined (41 of 50) rode on Dunlop tires. Despite the outcome, the first Superbike race of the weekend was anything but predictable. Suzukiâ€™s Mladin earned the pole with a time of 2:11.541 on Friday, quicker than his pole time from last year but still a few tenths off his fastest time of 2:11.208 set during race two in 2006. â€œOut of all the racetracks we've been to, this racetrack definitely feels a lot different (compared) to last year's bike,â€ Mladin commented after qualifying. â€œWe actually just found something there at the end of that session that I ultimately did my good lap time on, that felt pretty good, and started getting us a little bit in the ballpark of where we need to be.â€ Because rain dampened the track on and off all day Saturday, the second qualifying session became a rain-tire practice session and no one challenged the provisional qualifying order. AMA officials later declared the afternoon race â€œwetâ€ and all of the factory teams realized the potential for a close affair. In a brief practice session just before the race, Spies tumbled from his Yoshimura Suzuki GSX-R1000 and came up hobbling, causing many to question his fitness for the race. But he was ready when the competition flagged off and Spies rocketed into the lead. Mladin, meanwhile, suffered a poor start and had to work his way forward from fourth before overtaking Spies on lap two. Behind them an entertaining battle was waged between Honda Racingâ€™s Miguel Duhamel and Jordon Suzuki Motorsports Aaron Yates. Soon after Mladinâ€™s engine became unusually loud, signaling an unknown mechanical problem. The rains held off and Spies stayed close but Mladin maintained his lead all the way to the checkered flag for his 57th career AMA Superbike win. With four laps to go Yates low-sided out of third leaving Duhamel and Yoshimura Suzukiâ€™s Tommy Hayden in a fierce battle that went right to the line. Hayden drafted past Duhamel by just .027 seconds and collected his first podium of the season. â€œIâ€™d like to thank my Yoshimura Suzuki crew and Suzuki for delivering such a great motorbike in the GSX-R1000,â€ Mladin said. â€œThe bike allowed Yoshimura Suzuki to sweep the podium today and hopefully weâ€™ll come back and do it again tomorrow.â€ Later in the press room he added, â€œLap three, I believe, I split an exhaust pipeâ€¦ It was that bad and lost of lot of top end power up the front straight. I really had to change my riding a little bit as of when that happened, to try and carry more rolling speed, because the thing wasn't accelerating like it was on the first two laps. So we had some issues in that race and it was nice just to hold on and get the win.â€ As is becoming the custom, Dunlop riders took every one of the top 10 finishing positions. Superbike Race One Results: Dunlop finishers in the Top 10 1. Mat Mladin - Suzuki 2. Ben Spies - Suzuki 3. Tommy Hayden - Suzuki 4. Miguel Duhamel - Honda 5. Jake Zemke - Honda 6. Eric Bostrom - Yamaha 7. Roger Hayden - Kawasaki 8. Jason DiSalvo - Yamaha 9. Jamie Hacking - Kawasaki 10. Jake Holden - Suzuki The closest Formula Xtreme race of the year pitted the number one and two riders in the championship hunt-- defending class champion Josh Hayes and Attack Kawasakiâ€™s Steve Rappâ€”in a 10-lap duel of 600cc â€œSuperbikesâ€. The pair swapped the lead numerous times and the outcome was completely unknown until the checkered flag declared pole-sitter Hayes and his Erion Honda-tuned CBR600RR, equipped with a multi-compound N-Tec rear racing tire, the winner by .439 seconds. â€œThat was probably one of the most fun races Iâ€™ve had in a long time,â€ said Hayes of his first-ever win at Road America. â€œMy Honda was super fast. When it came down to the end of the race, as we were going through turn three, I could see that the right side of his (Rappâ€™s â€“ ed.) tire looked pretty bad, it looked like chunks of rubber were coming off it at me. Thatâ€™s when I decided I wanted to lead through the infield on the last lapâ€¦ that sealed it up for me and I was able to get a good run up the front straightaway.â€ Venezuelan Martin Cardenas, riding for the injured Michael Barnes, rode his M4 EMGO Suzuki to third, nipping Hayesâ€™ teammate Aaron Gobert by just .365 seconds. Six of the top 10 finishers crossed the line on Dunlop rubber. Formula Xtreme Results: Dunlop finishers in the Top 10 1. Josh Hayes - Honda 4. Aaron Gobert - Honda 5. Larry Pegram - Ducati 6. Marty Craggill - Ducati 8. Ryan Andrews - Honda 10. Chad Herrmann - Suzuki Formula Xtreme Championship Points: Top three riders 1. Hayes - 177 2. Rapp - 152 3. Gobert - 123 Drenching rains, accompanied occasionally by lightning and thunder, inundated Road America on Sunday. Although the track is approved by the AMA for wet racing, water running across the tarmac in many places forcing the postponement of the Superstock race to permit the Supersport and Superbike races to be conducted in sync with the scheduled SpeedTV broadcast. The Supersport race brought out full rain tiresâ€”soft compound, treaded tires front and rearâ€”for all of the Dunlop teams. Kawasaki Road Racing teammates Jamie Hacking and Roger Hayden diced with Matsushima Racing Suzukiâ€™s Danny Eslick for the first five laps of the 10-lap event, swapping positions back-and-forth in the slippery corners and drafting past one another on the long straights. But this was to be the day for Erion Hondaâ€™s Aaron Gobert to assert himself. After a poor start that saw him mired in ninth position after lap one, Gobert began passing the rest of the field on his CBR600RR as if they were standing still, setting lap times that were consistently two seconds faster than the leaders. By lap seven Gobert had overtaken everyone and he went on to win the race by more than three seconds. Hacking and Hayden finished second and third, respectively. â€œAt the start when the leaders took off I thought, â€˜Are these guys crazy?â€™ There were puddles everywhere,â€ said Gobert of his first Supersport win. â€œThe Hondaâ€™s been awesome, the boyâ€™s got new horsepower for us this weekend. You know, I maximized the wet practice when no one else went out. I went out there and changed my gearing, changed the bike and we worked on it. I actually did my qualifying time on a set of wets and the track was 95 percent dry. In the race, the puddles went down and the dry line came up and everything just came together.â€ The next four riders across the line were also on Dunlops, including series leader Josh Hayes, for a total of eight of the first 10 finishers. Supersport Results: Dunlop finishers in the Top 10 1. Aaron Gobert - Honda 2. Jamie Hacking - Kawasaki 3. Roger Hayden - Kawasaki 4. Josh Hayes - Honda 5. Blake Young - Suzuki 6. Tommy Hayden - Suzuki 7. Chaz Davies - Yamaha 10. Ryan Elleby - Honda Supersport Championship Points: Top three riders 1. Hayes - 161 2. Roger Hayden - 150 3. Hacking - 136 Fighting back from the effects of Saturdayâ€™s high-side just before the start of race one, Suzukiâ€™s Spies rode an strong race on Sunday, mastering the wet conditions en route to a flag-to-flag victory in Superbike race two. The race began in the pouring rain and every rider went out on full rain tires. A lightning-inspired red flag brought the field in for a complete restart after less than two laps. When the race began again, Spies took little time in charging to the lead and his lap times got faster and faster as the race wore on. Even after slowing in the final laps to cruise home with the win, Spies crossed the line on his GSX-R1000 nearly 12 seconds ahead of the next rider, Kawasakiâ€™s Jamie Hacking. Third went to Saturdayâ€™s winner, Mladin. â€œIt was really good,â€ said Spies, whose victory gives him a two-point margin in the championship. â€œWe usually donâ€™t do many changes to the bike before a race but with the wet race we made a couple of clicks difference and the bike was really good. Itâ€™s important to be out front in a rain race, riding your own race and not seeing spray, not chasing people and not making mistakes. Luckily we got out front and did it today.â€ Of his injury he said, â€œIâ€™ll say that how I look walking, definitely my ridingâ€™s not as badâ€¦ I bruised my quad so bad that I canâ€™t put a certain kind of weight on it and it looks like I broke something but itâ€™s not that bad.â€ As was the case in race one, Dunlop captured all of the top ten slots. Superbike Race Two Results: Dunlop finishers in the Top 10 1. Ben Spies - Suzuki 2. Jamie Hacking - Kawasaki 3. Mat Mladin - Suzuki 4. Aaron Yates - Suzuki 5. James Ellison - Honda 6. Jake Zemke - Honda 7. Jake Holden - Suzuki 8. John Haner - Suzuki 9. Eric Bostrom - Yamaha 10. Dominic Jones - Honda Superbike Championship Points: Top three riders 1. Spies â€“ 307 2. Mladin â€“ 305 3. Duhamel - 236 The last race of the weekend saw all the Dunlop competitors mount N-Tec multi-compound racing tires to take advantage of the improving traction on the drying track. M4 Emgo Suzukiâ€™s Goeff May held the lead for the first six laps before a charging Spies took control on his GSX-R1000. Spies gradually increased his lead and won with 2.819 seconds to spare over May and Suzukiâ€™s Scott Jensen, who was third. Spiesâ€™ N-Tec worked so well that he turned the fastest lap of the race on lap nine before slowing slightly to preserve his win and take the checkered flag. â€œWe knew we had to be on slicks,â€ said Spies of his fourth win this season. â€œThe track changed so much lap to lap that you couldnâ€™t tell what was going to be there and what wasnâ€™t. When we made the pass I tried to not go blazing for a couple laps but just not make any mistakes and keep a decent pace, and it worked out today.â€ Of the top 10 finishers, seven were on Dunlop tires.

Choi of Korea. Choi charged from five strokes behind to win the $6 million Memorial tournament with a near-flawless final round on Sunday. (Hunter Martin/Getty Images) DUBLIN, Ohio—South Korean K.J. Choi charged from five strokes behind to win the $6 million Memorial tournament with a near-flawless final round on Sunday. He gathered six birdies in a blistering front nine to hit the front at the turn, and used a hot putter to preserve his lead and claim a one-stroke victory over American Ryan Moore. Choi missed only one putt from inside 15 feet, shooting 65 on another ideal day for low scoring at Muirfield Village to finish at 17-under-par 271. The 37-year-old from Wando, who now lives in Houston, Texas, is the most successful Asian player in PGA Tour history but his fifth win in the U.S. and 11th globally was easily the biggest of his career. He learned the game from a Jack Nicklaus instruction book, and little did he think that two decades later he would win the great man&#39;s tournament. "I feel very honored, very happy to be living in the same age as Jack, and to win his tournament is very meaningful to me. I can only think that this was meant to be and I want to thank God for today," Choi, who became a Christian after moving to the U.S., told reporters. "It&#39;s my fifth win on tour, so I felt very comfortable, no pressure really. I&#39;m getting used to playing in the bigger tournaments." He certainly looked comfortable, making a series of clutch par-saving putts over the final three holes, a seven-footer at the 16th followed by a 16-footer at the 17th. He left himself with work at the par-four 18th after dumping a five-iron into a greenside bunker, from where he hit a decent recovery but was still nearly five feet from the hole. He stroked the putt home before waited to see if anyone could catch him. Moore was already in the clubhouse with a 66, so Choi only had to worry about Adam Scott and Rod Pampling, both one shot behind with two holes left. But the two Australians made matching bogeys at the 17th and Choi was home, gratefully receiving the congratulations of Nicklaus, along with $1,080,000. Pampling (72) parred the last to tie for third with Kenny Perry (63), two shots off the pace, while Scott (70) bogeyed the last to tie for fifth, another stroke back. Moore was not in the picture until very late, running off five straight birdies from the 13th hole. "To even be in the position I was on 18, I was very surprised," said the 2004 U.S. amateur champion, who will have no time to reflect on his performance with U.S. Open sectional qualifying on Monday. World number one Tiger Woods shot 67 to tie for 15th, eight strokes off the pace in his final tune-up for the U.S. Open starting next Thursday. Copyright 2000 - 2007 Epoch Times International

Per club policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed. The 6-foot-3, 350-pound Adams will be entering his 14th NFL season and joins the Broncos from Cincinnati, where he spent the 2006 campaign. The run-stopper started all 16 games for the Bengals in 2006, totaling 25 tackles and two sacks. Adams has played in 195 career regular-season games (166 starts) and recorded 463 tackles, three interceptions, 37 pass breakups, 10 forced fumbles and five fumble recoveries. His 44 career sacks are the fourth-best total among all active NFL defensive tackles. A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Adams also has played for Seattle (1994-99), Baltimore (2000-01), Oakland (2002) and Buffalo (2003-05). In 2000 with Baltimore, Adams tallied a career-best 69 tackles for a club that allowed the fewest rushing yards in a season since the 1970 NFL merger and won Super Bowl XXXV.

He'll learn today if he faces a similar punishment for his outburst Saturday. Piniella was suspended Sunday and fined by Major League Baseball for his animated argument with umpire Mark Wegner, but the length of his punishment will be decided today when Piniella speaks with John McHale Jr., executive vice president of administration for MLB. And now, back to baseball Because management personnel have no right of appeal, Piniella began serving the suspension Sunday. ''I wasn't expecting anything until the early part of the week,'' Piniella said before the game. He was not allowed in uniform on the field once the game started and watched the Cubs' 10-1 victory from his office. Former manager Dusty Baker was suspended for one game April 16, 2004, for arguing with umpire CB Bucknor about a double switch the umpire hadn't acknowledged. Baker was punished for ''inciting the crowd.'' Piniella kicked dirt on and around Wegner after the umpire called out Angel Pagan at third in the eighth inning. Piniella later said the umpire's call was correct, but he carried out a long and demonstrative argument, drawing cheers from the 40,290 fans and a shower of debris from the bleachers. But Piniella contends he never touched Wegner, a defense he will make to McHale Jr.. ''He was going to get one [game] no matter what happened,'' general manager Jim Hendry said. ''Hopefully, we'll get some things across to tell how we feel, and we'll see what happens.'' Bench coach Alan Trammell, who managed the Detroit Tigers for three years, filled in for Piniella. ''I asked him, and he said, 'You run it,''' Trammell said. Trammell's job was easy thanks to a long-awaited hitting assault by the Cubs and a masterful pitching job by Sean Marshall, who worked 6 2/3 innings and gave up one run and six hits and struck out eight to tie his career high. ''It was 'enough is enough,''' Marshall said of the team's approach to the game after a weekend of turmoil, starting with the fight between Carlos Zambrano and Michael Barrett before Piniella's tirade. ''Everyone stepped up and played to the potential we have. ''I think [Piniella's outburst] was good. It was a little extra spark, I guess, to get us going. It was fun to watch, too.'' Mark DeRosa, whose first-inning grand slam and five RBI set the tone early, credited Piniella with trying to end the team's malaise. ''I think Lou's ejection was two months of frustration,'' he said. ''It was a matter of time before that was coming. I know it worked for most of the guys. It's been frustrating and disappointing, and we wanted to get the fans back on our side.'' Alfonso Soriano, who went 3-for-5 after going only 5-for-23 (.217) in the first five games of the homestand, also credited Piniella. ''It gives me more energy to have a manager like Lou fight for us,'' he said. ''We've had too much frustration. This game was very important, especially before going to Milwaukee [today]. I hope we put everything together and start playing better.'' Make Us Your Home Page © Copyright 2007 Sun-Times News Group |

Feilhaber was among five U.S. starters who entered with five or fewer national team appearances. All made key contributions, with Feilhaber also assisting on Clint Dempsey's second-half goal. Sacha Kljestan, making his national team debut, set up Feilhaber's goal in the 28th minute that gave the United States a 2-1 lead. Michael Bradley, the son of new U.S. coach Bob Bradley, set up DaMarcus Beasley's penalty-kick goal to open the scoring in the 10th minute, and defenders Jonathan Bornstein and Jonathan Spector made key contributions from the back line. With most of the Americans' MLS stars playing with their club teams this weekend , including Landon Donovan, Eddie Johnson and Pablo Mastroeni , some of the younger players got the chance to make their case for playing time in the upcoming CONCACAF Gold Cup. The United States opens the of North and Central America and the Caribbean on Thursday night against Guatemala. After that tournament, the U.S. team plays as an invited guest at the Copa America, South America's championship. Those will be the first real competitions for Bradley, who had the interim tag removed from his title last month. Bradley was hired in December to replace Bruce Arena and is now 4-0-1 as U.S. coach. Michael Bradley, making fifth national team appearance, set up Beasley early with a sharp pass down the middle. Beasley dribbled in the box and was tripped up by goalkeeper Chen Dong, who was given a yellow card. Beasley converted the penalty kick in the 10th minute, beating Chen with a shot down the middle. China answered when Dong Fangzhuo sent a pass into the box that Wang Peng deflected. Zhang Yaokun came up with the loose ball and beat goalkeeper Tim Howard, who enters the Gold Cup as the No. 1 American goalkeeper ahead of Kasey Keller. Feilhaber and Kljestan teamed up for the go-ahead goal midway through the first half. Kljestan passed to Feilhaber in the right side of the box. Feilhaber dribbled in and chipped the ball over the charging goalie, getting tripped up after the shot. Zhang Yaokun made a desperate attempt to save the ball but was unable to stop the ball from going in to give the U.S. a 2-1 lead. Dempsey finally converted midway through the second half after having two good chances stopped by Chen. But the Chinese goalie could do nothing when Feilhaber's corner found Dempsey all alone for an easy header that made it 3-1. Oguchi Onyewu scored the final goal for the United States, heading in a cross from Beasley in the 79th minute. Keller was not tested at all in the second half as China struggled to generate much offense without regular captain Zheng Zhi, who He stayed in Asia to play for his club team Shandong in the East Asian Champions Cup. The Chinese play exhibitions against the Los Angeles Galaxy on Tuesday and the Colorado Rapids on June 10 as part of their tuneup for next month's Asian Cup.

(AP Photo/M. Spencer Green) NEW YORK -- Tank Johnson of the Chicago Bears was suspended by the NFL for the first eight games of the 2007 regular season for violating the league's new personal conduct policy. The defensive tackle recently served a two-month jail stint on a probation violation on gun-related charges. He's the third player suspended by commissioner Roger Goodell in little more than a month for off-field behavior. In April, Goodell suspended Tennessee Titans defensive back Adam "Pacman" Jones for the entire 2007 season and Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry for eight games. Jones is appealing his suspension. Goodell said Johnson's suspension could be reduced to six games if he has no further involvement with law enforcement and undergoes counseling. After meeting with Goodell last month upon his release, Johnson said he was ready to accept whatever punishment Goodell handed down and that he wants to become the NFL's "Man of the Year," the player honored for being its best citizen.

Sabean, and it's time to go Better times bring worse traffic Guerrero's homer gives Angels comeback win By The Associated Press Article Launched: 06/04/2007 01:21:17 AM PDT Click photo to enlarge The Los Angeles Angels congratulate designated hitter Vladimir Guerrero smiles as he crosses the plate after hitting a two run walk-off home run against the Baltimore Orioles in the ninth inning of a baseball game in Anaheim, Calif., Sunday, June 3, 2007. Angels won 4-3. The Los Angeles Angels are never out of a game as long as Vladimir Guerrero has a swing or two left. Held to one hit through seven innings, the AL West leaders beat Baltimore 4-3 on Sunday when Guerrero hit a two-run homer off Orioles closer Chris Ray in the bottom of the ninth inning. "Something in my heart told me that Vladdy was going to hit a homer," Angels starter Ervin Santana said. "He waited for his pitch and he hit it good." Chone Figgins greeted Ray (3-4) with a leadoff single in the ninth before Guerrero drove a hanging slider to left-center for his 350th career homer and 12th this season. Los Angeles won for the 14th time in 18 games and improved to 36-22, matching the best start in franchise history (1989). The Angels are a season-best 14 games over .500, and their 22-8 home record is the best in the major leagues. This victory appeared unlikely, however, while Orioles starter Jeremy Guthrie was shutting down Los Angeles' lineup. "It feels very good, especially knowing what our guys did on the mound, to be able to pick them up," Guerrero said through a translator. "The hits were hard to come by today. Some solid contact, but their guy also did a good job. Definitely, it's a huge win for us." In other AL games, it was: New York 6, Boston 5; Detroit 9, Cleveland 2; Oakland 4, Minnesota 2; Toronto 4, Chicago 3; Seattle 11, Texas 6; and Tampa Bay 5, Kansas City 1. Chris Bootcheck (1-0) pitched a perfect ninth for his first major league victory. It was the fourth blown save for Ray in 16 chances. "Every loss is tough, especially when you lose in the ninth inning," Ray said. "I don't feel good about it. Jeremy pitched a great game and he deserved to win it. It didn't come out that way, so obviously it's tough for him to have thrown that great and not get a decision out of it." Guthrie allowed two runs&mdash;one earned&mdash;and three hits over eight innings. Melvin Mora homered for Baltimore. Angels left fielder Garret Anderson played his first game since April 27 after missing the previous 34 because of a sore hip flexor on his right side. The Angels were 23-11 in his absence. Guerrero is batting .362 with 10 home runs and 38 RBIs in the Angels' 36 wins and .293 with two homers and eight RBIs in their 17 losses with him in the lineup. Jose Molina's one-out single in the third was the only hit for the Angels until Shea Hillenbrand singled with one out in the eighth and pinch-hitter Casey Kotchman followed with a double. Hillenbrand scored on Howie Kendrick's groundout, trimming Baltimore's lead to 3-2. Santana gave up three runs and seven hits over seven innings, striking out eight and walking one. Yankees 6, Red Sox 5 At Boston, Alex Rodriguez hit a tiebreaking homer in the ninth inning on an 0-2 pitch from Jonathan Papelbon (0-1), and New York rallied to take two of three in the series. Rodriguez reached 20 homers for the 12th straight season and improved to 7-for-15 with four homers and 11 RBIs in the ninth inning this year. The Yankees' late comeback from a 5-4 deficit kept them out of last place in the AL East and left them 12 1/2 games behind the first-place Red Sox. New York tied it in the eighth on Robinson Cano's RBI triple against Hideki Okajima. Mariano Rivera earned his fifth save&mdash;just his second since May 3. Red Sox starter Josh Beckett, trying to improve to 9-0, allowed four runs and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings. Tigers 9, Indians 2 At Cleveland, Jeremy Bonderman (5-0) overcame another shaky first inning and Detroit gained a four-game split. Gary Sheffield hit a two-run homer off Jeremy Sowers (1-6) for the Tigers, who pulled within 2 1/2 games of first-place Cleveland in the AL Central with a second straight win after going 0-5 against the Indians. Bonderman won his fifth straight start since April 30 after five no-decisions. Athletics 4, Twins 2 At Oakland, Calif., Chad Gaudin (6-1) beat Johan Santana (6-5) for his fifth straight win, and the Athletics took two of three games from Minnesota in a playoff rematch. Alan Embree got four outs for his fourth save. Blue Jays 4, White Sox 3 At Toronto, Adam Lind made up for a baserunning blunder with a go-ahead, three-run double in the sixth. Brian Tallet (2-1) pitched three hitless innings and Jeremy Accardo earned his seventh save in eight chances. Toronto overcame a two-run homer from Jim Thome and a solo shot by Rob Mackowiak. Chicago has lost seven of eight. Blue Jays first baseman Lyle Overbay is expected to miss four to six weeks after breaking a bone in his right hand when he was hit by a pitch from John Danks. Mariners 11, Rangers 6 At Seattle, Jose Lopez had four hits, including a three-run double to highlight a five-run fourth, and Ryan Feierabend (1-1) lasted 7 1-3 innings to earn his first career win. Victor Diaz had a career-high five RBIs with a three-run homer and a two-run shot for the bumbling Rangers. Mark Teixeira added a solo homer, but Robinson Tejeda (4-6) gave up a season-high eight runs&mdash;seven earned&mdash;and eight hits in 5 2-3 innings. Devil Rays 5, Royals 1 At St. Petersburg, Fla., J.P. Howell (1-0) pitched eight impressive innings in his first start this season, and Tampa Bay got solo homers from Delmon Young and Carlos Pena. Scott Elarton (1-2) lost for the sixth time in six career starts against the Devil Rays. The Royals lost for just the third time in 11 road games.

See you in August. Is anyone else pleased the Red Sox will be playing someone other than the New York Yankees for the next two-plus months? Parting sweet, not sorrowful Rivals have had their fill so far Josh Beckett left in the seventh with a lead, but the bullpen couldn't preserve his ninth win. (JIM DAVIS/GLOBE STAFF) By Nick Cafardo, Globe Staff | Sayonara, Yankees. See you in August. Is anyone else pleased the Red Sox will be playing someone other than the New York Yankees for the next two-plus months? The schedule has been rather excessive in that regard. Too many Red Sox-Yankees games too close together. Twelve games through June 3. Red Sox-Yankees overload, for sure. It's been pleasant for the Red Sox since they have amassed a 12 1/2-game lead over the Yankees to this point. But these matchups, other than the first couple and last night's (a 6-5 Sox loss), haven't been very compelling (the Red Sox won five of six in the first two series) given the number of games the Sox are up on the Yankees. The story lines have dimmed as well. There was great anticipation for Roger Clemens possibly starting at Fenway Park over the weekend, but the Yankees went the cautious route and made Clemens make a third rehab start. But in that start, last Monday for Scranton/Wilkes Barre, Clemens tweaked a groin muscle. He could start Saturday against Pittsburgh. How many ways can Red Sox fans boo Alex Rodriguez? The blonde-wig masks worn by Sox fans Friday night to make fun of A-Rod's night on the town in Toronto were creative, but that lost its luster when the Red Sox lost, 9-5. And he certainly had the last laugh last night with his ninth-inning winning homer. Sox fans missed out on a "Steroids! Steroids!" chant because Jason Giambi was back in New York on the disabled list with a foot injury that might keep him out for most of the season. We've also had the "dirty plays" subject line. A-Rod was accused of that by second baseman Dustin Pedroia in New York a couple weeks back when he slid hard in an attempt to break up a double play and came up with his elbow. Then, Saturday, Mike Lowell, trying to disrupt a tag by second baseman Robinson Cano, pulled up a little and dug his shoulder into Cano's body. Cano charged "dirty play" after the game and said it was much dirtier than A-Rod's slide. There was also Scott Proctor's high hard one that grazed Kevin Youkilis's helmet Friday, but that didn't muster much emotion. Even the league's disciplinary bosses felt Proctor's pitch wasn't deliberate and elected not to fine or suspend him. David Ortiz, before the start of the series, said, "We're playing them again?" "There have been a lot of games so early against them," Derek Jeter said. "I think the fans love these games, and as players they're fun once the game gets going. Sometimes the hype for them gets a little old, but I think the play on the field is intense and everyone wants to play their best." Players love it when these series end and they don't have to deal with the media scrutiny. It's particularly good for the Sox, who now escape west, where they will play the Oakland A's for four games followed by an interleague series against the Arizona Diamondbacks, where the Drew brothers -- J.D. and Stephen -- will be reunited and where the Sox get to see their old assistant general manager, Josh Byrnes, who now runs the Diamondbacks. The Sox might even face old nemesis Randy Johnson. OK, those story lines pale by comparison to Sox-Yankees and the tales of A-Rod, Johnny Damon, and the rest, but it's a welcome change, right? What these Sox-Yankees games have shown is that Boston has been able to dominate a team in distress, winning seven of 12. By Aug. 28, the next time the Sox and Yankees reunite, we'll have a better understanding of how meaningful that series will be. The Sox could be out of reach by then, or if the Yankees have regrouped, they might be fighting for a wild card and it could whet our appetites once more for this never-ending soap opera. Schedule-makers have it tough, but the quick hit early and then two-plus months off between the rivals appears extremely lopsided. An intermittent sprinkling of Sox-Yankees is great, but too much, followed by too little, is frustrating. I'm sure by late July we'll be clamoring for another Sox-Yankees series after we've seen a bunch of teams nobody in Boston really cares about. For now, though, it's great not to see the Yankees for a while. I think we all need a break. Nick Cafardo can be reached at &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

The Senators defeated the Ducks 5-3. &#40;Bruce Bennett/Getty Images&#41; OTTAWA -- June 3, 2007 If we are to believe Chris Pronger, his second playoff suspension in a matter of weeks isn't the mark of a dirty player with little regard for his opponents or his teammates, but a cry for help. How else to explain the actions of a supposedly elite player who for the second time this playoff season leaves opponents motionless on the ice with blows to the head, then suggests he is powerless to change his ways. Ducks Will Be Without Pronger for Game 4 "I don't think I can, for me to be the type of player I can be," Pronger said. "Obviously, it's a fine line and getting finer every year, and we have to make subtle adjustments. But I don't think I can make wholesale changes and still be the type of player I can be." That'll be of small comfort to Tomas Holmstrom, whom he bloodied in the Western Conference finals by smashing his head into the glass, or to Dean McAmmond, who may or may not play Monday night in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals, or to Pronger's teammates, who face the prospect of having to win on the road without their best player as they try to prevent the Senators from tying this series. After the Holmstrom hit, the often irreverent Pronger suggested that it was physics that led to the injury -- he is tall and Holmstrom is not -- and that the overzealous Canadian media were at the heart of his one-game suspension. Sunday, moments after the decision was handed down by the league, Pronger was slightly more contrite. He did not blame the media and seemed to accept the consequences for his actions. "I've obviously been in front of them before and now I'm a repeat offender," said Pronger, who has been suspended by the league seven times in his career. "And they did the right thing here. It's a situation where there was a head blow, and that's obviously something they're trying to crack down on. And I don't blame them in any way." This notion that Pronger is powerless to control himself, as though he has some nasty DNA that cannot be altered, is baloney. This isn't a gambling problem or a drinking problem or some other clinical issue. This is a player who simply indulges himself with reckless behavior. Look around the league. Zdeno Chara, all 6-foot-9 of him, was a recent Norris Trophy nominee, but he doesn't resort to the kinds of behavior that has marked Pronger's play. Neither did Larry Robinson, perhaps the greatest big-man defensemen of all time. Pronger Defends Against Goon Rep Read 2 Comments and Post Your Own WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts.

Former NASCAR chairman Bill France dies By Jenna Fryer, AP Auto Racing Writer Bill France Jr., who transformed NASCAR from a small Southern sport into a billion-dollar conglomerate during his 31 years as chairman, died Monday. He was 74. He died at his Daytona Beach, Fla., home, NASCAR spokesman Ramsey Poston said. France had been in poor health for much of the last decade -- he was diagnosed with cancer in 1999. Although he was in remission, the extensive treatments took a toll. He never regained his full strength, often had difficulty breathing and had taken to using a motorized scooter to get around. France was hospitalized at least twice this year but spent his final days resting at home. His last public appearance was Feb. 12 in Daytona Beach, where NASCAR's top names gathered to "Roast and Toast" him at the Bill France Hot Dog Dinner during the Daytona 500 build-up. Even there, especially there, France Jr., who ruled NASCAR with an iron fist, called the shots. His toasters that evening were gently reminded to avoid any harsh roasting. France did not speak during the dinner but received guests from his seat on the banquet floor. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Kanaan wins at Milwaukee The pair banged wheels as Andretti-Green racer Patrick attempted to follow her team-mate Dario Franchitti past the 2005 champion, an incident that incensed the American. Patrick, 26, stormed up to Wheldon in parc ferme after the race, demanding to know why he had over-defended his line dangerously in her opinion rather than letting her by. Patrick said: "I just came up to him, I looked at him, put my arm around him, started walking, and I said, 'What happened? What was that for? Did you not see me? Why didn't you back off?' And he didn't say anything. "I said, 'I was clearly inside of you,' because I heard him saying in an interview that I wasn't all the way up alongside of him. So I'm not sure what is lost in translation there, but I was completely alongside of him. "And then he said, 'Well, you can't get caught out in the marbles.' I said, 'Well, then that's a pass, Dan. I got by you, you need to let off and you didn't, you turned into me.' "That was about it. And I told him, you know, if you don't think that I'm going to remember this, I don't know why you're being like this, but if you don't think I'm going to remember, you're crazy. "I just grabbed his arm and that's it. I grabbed his arm and kind of pushed off. But, you know, it was nothing violent, nothing violent." It is not the first time Patrick has been involved in a physical altercation after a race. She was accused of punching Jacques Lazier in an ambulance after the pair took each other out at Fontana in 2005. But British driver Wheldon said that he would fight fire with fire if Patrick persisted with her accusations, even if the Chip Ganassi racer dismissed this incident as "nothing much." Wheldon, 28, said: "She's probably feeling the pressure of not winning races when her teammates are. She's just feisty. "I think in a situation like that, sometimes you get desperate. It's never nice to come into contact with somebody. She's messing with the wrong person if she wants to get feisty." Jordan retains Indy lead.

Kevin Frandsen was thrown out at home on a fielder's choice for the second out of the fifth inning. But it didn't matter, as Ryan Klesko hit a no-doubt home run into the right-field seats to score three runs. Two more runs scored before Lieber was able to end the inning. The Phillies dropped below .500 and finished with a 2-5 record during their seven-game homestand. They loaded the bases in the fifth and managed only an RBI groundout by Jayson Werth after scoring 14 runs the previous two games. Lieber lasted five-plus innings and gave up five runs on 10 hits while walking three. is an associate reporter for MLB.com.
