Computerworld Daily News (First Look and Wrap-Up) The Weekly Top 10 Palm&#039;s Foleo $500 un-laptop (and alien ant farm) Thu, 05/31/2007 - 6:56am Get in sync with Thursday's IT Blogwatch: in which Palm launches the $500 "email companion". Not to mention the Zimbabwe ant farm... Palm Inc. today announced a smart-phone companion product today called Foleo. [It] will connect via Bluetooth to a Treo device running either the Palm operating system or Windows Mobile, and it will use a large screen and full-size keyboard to help users edit e-mail and office documents. Palm co-founder Jeff Hawkins ... called [it] the first in a "major new category" of devices that serve as companions to phones ... Foleo is built on an open Linux-based platform and will sell for $599 with an introductory rebate of $100, bringing it down to $499 ... It will stay synchronized with a smart phone throughout the day at the touch of a button. The device runs the Opera 9 Web browser and will be available sometime this summer ... turns on and off instantly and has a battery that lasts up to five hours ... will feature a 10.2-in. screen and weigh just over 2 lb. ... will also provide Wi-Fi connectivity. Bert Latamore unpeels a banana [That's "Guerrilla", you fool -Ed.] I have hoped for a long time that we would see Linux-based PDAs/smart phones enter the market. I still hope for one that has the Palm application and user interfaces built in so that it will run my 30-odd third party PDA applications. I think the big question with this device is will people spend that much extra for it, and will they carry it around with them, or will they connect their Bluetooth-enabled smart phone to their Bluetooth-enabled laptop to receive and manage email when they are out of the office or home? The advantage of the smart phone in handling e-mail is that you can do it anywhere, without needing a desktop or even a chair. This will require that you carry an extra device, which will probably be too big to fit in a pocket (judging from the description) and which apparently only functions as a terminal for the smart phone. Most people who need computing power away from the desk already carry a laptop, so this becomes yet another device to stuff in that computer bag. Then we get into the question of battery drain, which is always the limiting factor in small device design. Bluetooth is low-power compared to Wi-Fi, but it does drain a smart phone's battery pretty quickly if it is on for a long time. Harry McCracken rides the boondoggle I'm at the Wall Street Journal's D conference, and Palm's Jeff Hawkins--one of the few so-called visionaries in the industry who really is a visionary--is unveiling the Foleo, a new device that he's dubbing a "mobile companion." It's a sort of a subnotebook-looking gadget that he's touting as being a complement to a smartphone such as a Treo. He's saying that he first conceived of it five years ago, when he and the other Palm founders were exiled at Handspring, but it was too early to build it--the technology didn't exist, and smartphones hasn't arrived. The keyboard has an unusual approach to input that reminds me a bit of a Lenovo ThinkPad--there's a pointer nub embedded in the keyboard, a scroll wheel below the space bar, and a couple of "mouse buttons." But no touchpad. Documents to Go, which, as on the Treo, lets you view and edit Microsoft Office documents--Word and Excel, and some basic PowerPoint stuff (you can't create slideshows from scratch, but can make quick edits). You can view PDFs ... it's easy to write applications for the device ... [there's] a photo viewer ... you can browse the Web over Wi-Fi or your phone connection. It reminds Kevin C. Tofel of Windows Smart Displays The new Palm Foleo ... looks to be a small 10-inch laptop with keyboard, but looks are deceiving. The Foleo is actually an extension to your Palm Treo smartphone: the two devices are connected via Bluetooth to provide you all of your smartphone data on a larger screen with an attached full-sized keyboard. Since the Foleo isn't a full or heavy OS-laden computer, it provides the advantage of "Instant On" capabilities. I see it a nice way to view and interact with your Palm data or use with your phone's connection to browse the web on a larger screen for up to five hours on a battery charge. Additionally, you can use it to browse pictures, provide presentations and more ... definitely is reminscient of the Microsoft Windows Smart Displays that might have been ahead of their time. My initial thought: very innovative and it will appeal to Palm Treo owners. Will it appeal to the UMPC market? The keyboard is there, but the computing power and the inability to run a multitude of every Windows apps leads me to a limited UMPC audience. But Carlo Longino is underwhelmed Stick A Fork In Palm ... 'cause-they're-done It's hard to understand the point of the Foleo, or why Hawkins and Palm think it's so wonderful. There are two ways to see it: first, as an admission that Palm won't ever be able to create a Treo that will satisfy users' needs, or an admission that they think their Treos are perfect and this is the only way they can figure out to improve on it. Neither is particularly good for the company. The Foleo's hardly compelling, when $500 fully-featured laptops are pretty common these days, while the future lies in crafting more powerful and useful smartphones, not in simply relegating them to serve as a modem for a redundant bigger device. And Rod Edwards is aghast Arrghhhhhhhh. I can&rsquo;t help but be curmudgeonly when this sort of craziness is what&rsquo;s making the news. Looks too big to be pocketable ... Overlaps with laptop usage scenarios ... Another layer of synchronization: Desktop syncs to smartphone. Smartphone syncs to Foleo ... Overlaps with UMPC but with 1/100th the functionality ... EXPENSIVE: $500 for an adjunct screen and keyboard for your smartphone ... Overlap with web email and document editing tools ... A nice big screen that can&rsquo;t play movies. There&rsquo;s a vanishingly small niche of people that would find this compelling and affordable. Lame, lame, lame ... Palm to struggle, cheap acquisition bait for also-lame Motorola. Video will suck on the Foleo. Even low-quality YouTube videos will be "jerky," thanks to the Foleo's sluggish processor. But Your humble blogwatcher is bemused Sounds to me like what Microsoft's Origami/UMPC should have been: light, focussed, inexpensive, instant-on. Most criticism boils down to, "It's not a full-featured Windows laptop." Well, duh! Let's see: Ultra-light / Inexpensive / Full-featured -- In many ways, it tries to solve the same problems as the Nokia 770/N800 line -- but in a more conventional form-factor (i.e., it has a keyboard).

It's ultra-light. Sadly, it's expensive and it's lacking in features. If it had come out under $200, or could play all the media the Treo could (which includes video and games), it would be something to crow about. So sad to see Palm flounder this way... on Thu, 05/31/2007 - 8:31am| Why is RIM destroying Palm in the market place. Let's see. Hmmmmm Foleo, I am sure in some language it means foolish. What marketing genius came up with this one. on Thu, 05/31/2007 - 9:22am| I agree that RIMS is beating out the competition, but if any cell company allowed email to work for free, they would beat out RIMS. There are now 3 phone OSs. Palm, Windows Mobile, and RIM. Due to palms simple design and easy programming it'll still be around, but needs to be updated with more active communcations between devices and the internet. This new Feleo has good intentions (quick response, compact, and lightweight), but I'll just pull out my laptop and use it wherever I go and use a cell card. on Thu, 05/31/2007 - 10:13am| Post a new comment The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

You've probably heard from him, federal authorities say. Many times. And with his arrest, you could see an immediate decrease in the amount of spam e-mail in your inbox, they said. One expert estimated that the man agents dubbed the "Spam King" when they arrested him Wednesday sent billions, perhaps even tens of billions, of e-mails a day. On just two groups of servers, in just a few months, federal investigators found more than 200 million spam messages linked to 27-year-old Robert Soloway. The online empire was run from Soloway's high-end, Harbor Steps apartment on the Seattle waterfront, investigators said. Wednesday, he appeared in court unshaven, wearing loafers with no socks, to hear Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Warma announce that if he's found guilty of the fraud, money laundering and identity theft charges in the 35-count indictment, he could spend decades behind bars. "We know that Robert Soloway is one of the most prolific spammers in the world," Warma said before the hearing. "He has condemned them (his victims) to perpetual spam hell" unless they escape by canceling their domain names or changing their Internet protocol addresses. So notorious is Soloway that the Internet fumes with anti-spammers worldwide livid with his alleged activities. There are endless rants, tricks on how to stop him, a Web site called "solowaysucks.net," and all sorts of personal dirt -- from Soloway's driving infractions to clues on where he went to high school to a link on how to call his mother. "Punk," "worm," "piece of (excrement)" and "bloody gutless coward" are among the nicer epithets. But on Wednesday, many people rejoiced. "Busted!" wrote one anti-spam activist online. "Fantastic news," wrote another. "It's extremely gratifying," said Neil Schwartzman, the executive director for the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email, an anti-spam group. He said that Soloway not only spammed people, but targeted anti-spammers with "mail bombings." "Truly, this is a really bad guy," he said. The feds have taken steps to seize Soloway's bank accounts, but don't know yet how much money they contain. "He claims not to have any money," said U.S. Attorney Jeff Sullivan. "But he drives a very expensive car (500 series Mercedes) and lives in a very expensive apartment." In an apparent effort to hide the true ownership of his Web site, authorities say Soloway constantly moved it to different domains -- even registering last year through Chinese Internet Service providers. The spammed messages used to advertise his corporate Web sites contained false header information and were relayed using networks of slave computers called "botnets." Soloway's alleged actions in the virtual world caused real-world chaos. His spam contained phony headers with e-mail addresses or domain names of innocent real people or organizations, which were subsequently blamed for Soloway's spam and "blacklisted" as a result. "The amount of damage he does to the Internet -- the fraud thing to innocent people who think they're hiring some Internet person -- is awful," said John Reid, a volunteer with The Spamhaus Project, an anti-spam group. He said Soloway preyed on computer-gullible business owners who thought they were hiring a legitimate company to help increase traffic to their Web sites -- only to discover that Soloway sent waves of spam in their name. Soloway, who has also lived in California and Oregon, has been on the group's top 10 list for notorious spammers in recent years, but isn't on it currently. Reid estimated that Soloway sent billions, perhaps even tens of billions, of e-mails a day. "He's very high-volume," he said. In 2005, Microsoft won a $7 million judgment against Soloway, after it sued him over spam sent through Microsoft's MSN and Hotmail services. Later that year, an Internet service provider in Oklahoma won a $10 million judgment against him in a spam-related lawsuit. The government has filed a claim for $772,998 from Soloway, representing the proceeds of his activity. The grand jury indictment accuses Soloway of operating Newport Internet Marketing Corp., which offered a "broadcast e-mail" software product and "broadcast e-mail" services that constitute illegal spam under the federal CAN-SPAM Act. The law, which went into effect Jan. 1, 2004, makes it illegal to transmit a large number of commercial e-mail messages in combination with certain criminalizing factors, such as using another computer to relay the message with the intent to hide its source or using falsified header information in the e-mail. Soloway allegedly used such techniques to defeat spam filters. The Northwest Computer Crimes Taskforce, which is housed at the FBI and includes the IRS Criminal Investigation Division and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, launched an investigation after the Federal Trade Commission and the state Attorney General's Office received hundreds of complaints that Soloway and his corporation had made false and fraudulent claims about his products and services. The victims couldn't get refunds, felt threatened and were being blamed for sending illegal spam as a result of patronizing Soloway's company, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Warma. Chuck Harwood, director of the FTC in Seattle, appealed to victims of spam to complain to his office by forwarding the offending e-mail to spam@uce.gov. Sullivan, the U.S. attorney, said spam affects everyone who goes online. "It's estimated that 80 percent of the traffic on the Internet is, in fact, spam." Soloway will spend at least the next five days at the Federal Detention Center at SeaTac pending a detention hearing Monday. P-I reporter Nina Akhmeteli contributed to this report.

http://www.smh.com.au/news/mobiles--handhelds/palms-new-baby/2007/05/31/1180205383412.html&cid Palm's new ultra-compact companion - Mobiles & Handhelds - Connectivity Welcome to The Sydney Morning Herald. Palm's new ultra-compact companion The Palm Foleo has a large screen and full-size keyboard with which to view and edit email and office documents residing on a smartphone. 9:51AM Palm&#160;has introduced a compact portable computer to accompany its Treo smartphone, seeking to regain its competitive edge in the crowded high-end handheld device market. The new "Foleo" is about the size of a hardcover book and, at 1.1 kilograms, half the weight of other small laptop computers. It is designed to be used with a smartphone, to help business travellers better manage their e-mail and documents by offering a 10-inch screen, full keyboard and wireless technology. Palm, best known for personal digital assistants (PDAs) and Treo phones, said it expects the Foleo to eventually work with rival smartphones such as Research In Motion's Blackberry and Apple's iPhone, although it has not discussed technology-sharing agreements with those companies. Company founder Jeff Hawkins said he expected unit sales of Foleo - priced at $US599 before a $US100 rebate beginning this summer in the US - to be smaller than Treo units sales at first. Will Palm's Foleo fly? "Ultimately, it will make smartphones more successful," he said in an interview. "The volume we anticipate selling of Foleo initially will be small compared to the volume of Treos. It's not going to be a driver in the short term. But it allows us to rethink how you design smartphones." The Foleo may signal a shift in focus for Palm, which dominated the market for personal digital assistants (PDAs) after it launched its original Palm Pilot in 1996. Its PDA sales dwarfed those of rivals such as Hewlett-Packard and Sony, but PDA demand dwindled early in this decade as similar features were built into cheaper mobile phones. Palm's Treo, which combines a phone with its PDA operating system, eventually became the company's signature product with shipments of 2.3 million units in the last fiscal year. Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies in San Jose, said mass appeal for the Foleo is not likely, since smartphones represent a fraction of the overall mobile phone market and only a portion of those customers will be interested in carrying a separate device. Moreover, many business travelers are resigned to carrying a smartphone and a full portable computer. "I will argue that this product is for the 'road warrior.' It's not probably for mainstream, it's more of a business tool," said Bajarin, who noted that Foleo will compete with low-cost laptop PCs. "It will hit a nerve with a certain segment and in that sense has a lot of potential." With Foleo, Palm enters the burgeoning world of open source computing, a growing market of devices that are not based on the dominant operating system software made by the likes of Microsoft or Apple. Open source developers traditionally write software that builds upon others' work, and is distributed for free or at low cost. Palm's device would also compete with Dell, which last week started selling Linux-based PCs. "One big unknown is what happens if the open source world decides to embrace (Foleo), as the first mobile Linux portable. It actually has potential ... if the open source world decides that this is a powerful way of expending the Linux franchise," Bajarin said. Separately, Palm Chief Executive Ed Colligan played down speculation that the company was for sale, saying that the new product proves it is working on innovation. "We're not focused on figuring out how to sell the company," he said on the CNBC television network. Shares of Palm were up 1.7 per cent on Wednesday afternoon, rising 27 cents to $US16.45 on the Nasdaq. send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today Palm's new ultra-compact companion The Palm Foleo has a large screen and full-size keyboard with which to view and edit email and office documents residing on a smartphone.

MEGA DOPPLER 13 ANYWHERE: Get Mega Doppler 13 radar on your cell phone or PDA for free NASA administrator questions need to combat global warming - NASA administrator Michael Griffin is drawing the ire of his agency's preeminent climate scientists after apparently downplaying the need to combat global warming. Info mentioned on air In a pretaped interview to be broadcast this morning on National Public Radio's ":Morning Edition" program, Griffin is asked by NPR's Steve Inskeep whether he is concerned about global warming. "I have no doubt that a trend of global warming exists," Griffin told Inskeep. "I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with." "To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn't change," Griffin said. "I guess I would ask which human beings -- where and when -- are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take." Griffin's comments -- released in transcript form by NPR -- immediately drew stunned reaction from James Hansen, NASA's top climate scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. "It's an incredibly arrogant and ignorant statement," Hansen told ABC News. "It indicates a complete ignorance of understanding the implications of climate change." Hansen believes Griffin's comments fly in the face of well-established scientific knowledge that hundreds of NASA scientists have contributed to. "It's unbelievable," said Hansen. "I thought he had been misquoted. It's so unbelievable." News media inquiries to NASA headquarters about Griffin's comments prompted the space agency to make the unusual move of issuing a news release late Wednesday night. "NASA is the world's preeminent organization in the study of Earth and the conditions that contribute to climate change and global warming," Griffin said in a statement. "The agency is responsible for collecting data that is used by the science community and policy makers as part of an ongoing discussion regarding our planet's evolving systems. It is NASA's responsibility to collect, analyze and release information. It is not NASA's mission to make policy regarding possible climate change mitigation strategies. As I stated in the NPR interview, we are proud of our role and I believe we do it well." Hansen, featured prominently in Al Gore's global warming documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth," has been warning of the potential dangers of climate change since the 1980s. In late 2005, he accused NASA of trying to improperly censor him after he warned that Earth's climate might be approaching a dangerous "tipping point." The agency later fired a public affairs employee, a political appointee of the Bush administration, over the incident. Last year, many NASA scientists were upset when reports surfaced that the agency had quietly deleted the phrase "to understand and protect our home planet" from the NASA mission statement. The scientists believe research on issues like climate change will suffer as NASA shifts priorities toward exploration missions to the moon and Mars. "Earth has always been central to NASA's science," Hansen said. Copyright &copy; 2007 ABC News Internet Ventures If you have a comment about this or another story on abc13.com, discuss it here.

Toshiba&#039;s AMD Laptops Due in Fall A few more details emerge about the three energy-efficient Turion-powered notebooks. Part 1 of a special five-part series. Martyn Williams, IDG News Service Wednesday, May 30, 2007 7:00 AM PDT A little more detail is known about the new laptops from Toshiba Corp. that will use processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Toshiba will launch three laptops in its Satellite range in North America based on AMD's Turion 64 X2 dual-core chip and M690 chipset, AMD said on Wednesday. Toshiba, which confirmed plans on Tuesday for AMD machines but offered no details, said Wednesday that the computers will be available in the third quarter. The M690 chipset has just been launched by AMD and will, according to the company, help reduce power consumption and lead to a 25 percent increase in battery life compared to the previous-generation AMD platform. The Japanese PC maker, which ranked fourth in the laptop market in the first quarter of this year, hasn't used AMD chips in laptops since 2000. In an antitrust lawsuit filed against processor-rival Intel Corp. in 2005 AMD alleged that Toshiba stopped using its chips after receiving a "very substantial" payment from Intel. Toshiba was receiving "market development funds" from Intel worth about US$25 million to $30 million per quarter and those would be jeopardized if it used AMD chips, the lawsuit alleged. AMD is stepping up pressure against Intel in the laptop market and recently disclosed plans to launch a new laptop platform called Puma in 2008. Puma is AMD's answer to Intel's recently launched Santa Rosa laptop platform. The two companies are locked in competition at the bottom-end of the laptop market too. AMD scored the contract to supply chips for One Laptop Per Child's "$100 laptop" after which Intel introduced its own machine for emerging markets, the Classmate PC. / 1000 max characters Sony Adds Two Compact Laptop Lines Palm Introduces Foleo &#039;Mobile Companion&#039; Entry-Level Toshiba Laptop Gets AMD Chip OLPC Seeks Educational Games for XO Laptop Dell Ships Ubuntu Linux PCs Vista on a Laptop, Part 3 VeriSign CEO Stratton Sclavos resigns, investment community pleased.

For your heretofore respected newspaper to feature, as front-page serious news, the opening of a self-styled "Creation Museum" whose purpose is to indoctrinate the gullible and ignorant with foolish, unscientific, and incidentally unoriginal fables is an indelible stain upon your integrity. For any rational person to claim the earth was created in six days some 6,000 years ago is so patently ludicrous, such an impossibility, and so preposterously counter to established proven science as to be worth only scorn and ridicule. Furthermore, the assertion by this "Answers in Genesis" group that Biblical creation is true is ipso facto false. Just read the first two chapters of Genesis to find two separate (1:1-2:3 and 2:4b-25) conflicting and inconsistent, e.g. order of creation, accounts which themselves are derivative with background in older Near Eastern mythology, e.g. the flood and creation myths in "Epic of Gilgamesh" and "Enuma Elish"! Answers in Genesis indeed! Which account? These people are pathetic. But you know better and, therefore, your article is a cheap, irresponsible pandering to superstitious readers; at best this belongs in a small paragraph with the "Star Wars" anniversary story in the escapism section. To impart cover of credibility and respectability to emotion-driven drivel and its attendant squandering of $27 million is intellectually reprehensible journalism and to promote and publicize humbug as reliable, important news just feeds garbage disguised as sustenance to the misguided, the lost, and those so anxious for security they will believe the unbelievable. For shame! Evolution not science, rather a sacred cow A May 28 article reprinted from the [Los Angeles] Times is a lie promoted by an obviously atheistic author. Evolution parades behind a mask of "science," but is really a sacred cow that is as factual as Greek mythology. It contradicts even the most basic laws of thermodynamics. Only a fool who is trying to escape accountability before the Creator would believe such far-fetched jargon. Creationism welcomes and encourages investigation. However, how the universe began is a matter of history, not science. The Bible is a book of history that factually records the historical events of creation. Unless you are willfully blind, the fact that the universe operates by design is a simple deduction from everything you see in the cosmos. It is evolution that is an assault on science. Potential is strong for light rail in city Thank you for the article on light rail in Toledo. As a former Toledoan now living in St. Louis, I can vouch for the benefits of the Metro mass transit system here, including the Metrolink rail lines. Toledo will need to do its homework carefully and assess its options realistically to design an effective network of bus and rail lines, but the potential is certainly there. In St. Louis, stops at educational institutions, hospitals, and other large employers create a steady demand that helps supplement the event traffic from sports events, concerts, etc. I think Toledo could find a successful mix as well, and I wish the region success as it explores its options. I can't wait to buy my first TARTA rail ticket. Transit system could boost area tourism After traveling to many cities in this great nation of ours, I was excited to read that Toledo is seriously considering a light rail system. This type of mass transit not only can be environmentally friendlier than autos, but it can provide a fast method of getting downtown and stimulate economic growth. What seriously disappointed me, though, was that no mention was made of running light rail to and from the local airport. Can you imagine a bigger push for the "Buy Local-Fly Local" campaign than if citizens of Toledo were able to take a light rail to the airport for a fraction of the cost of parking there? Conversely, as the city tries to boost its tourism and convention business, can you imagine if air travelers were able to hop on a light rail and have quick access to the downtown hotels? Better yet, hop on a light rail and be dumped out at the SeaGate Convention Centre, Fifth Third Field, or the new downtown sports arena? This can be done. Twenty years ago I got my first experience traveling via light rail from the suburbs of Cleveland to the downtown district - years before Jacobs Field opened up. In Chicago, Toronto, San Francisco/Oakland, New York and many other cities, a light rail or subway has a stop right next to their baseball fields and arenas. Heck, even Detroit, whose downtown revitalization has only just begun, has a monorail system that takes travelers throughout the downtown area. I only hope that our local leaders can think this far out, and not just to their next election. Reducing oil imports can help war effort During World War II we supported our troops by making sacrifices at home while they were overseas fighting. This required rationing of scarce commodities such as gasoline, tires, automobiles, and certain foods. As we fight the current war, which is going on all over the world, we are reluctant to make any sacrifice at home. Apparently a large number of us do not understand we are at war with an enemy who has sworn to wipe us off this earth. This enemy recruits followers from any area of discontent in any country. He answers to no sovereign nation but receives support from nations who find that this disruptive force can serve their purposes. One way we could help is to reduce imports of oil. Our dependence on these imports is making some foreign countries rich and allowing some of this money to flow to the various groups that are committed to our destruction. In other words, we are financing the groups our troops are fighting and dying to allow us to live free. Some of the ways we could reduce oil imports are to raise the corporate average fleet economy standard each year for automobiles; establish a CAFE average for non-commercial trucks; have an excise tax on vehicles that do not at least meet the CAFE averages and use the proceeds to support alternative sources of energy, and pass legislation that would reduce the importation of oil by 10 percent of the amount imported in the prior year. If we allow that pattern each year for 20 years I believe we would be importing approximately 12 percent of what we are currently importing. Supply and demand is elementary concept Have you ever watched Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader? That is the show that came to mind when I read the letter titled, "Why is diesel cheaper than unleaded?" I thought just about everyone knew about supply and demand. Although the fuel indeed comes from the same barrel, gasoline is a more refined fuel. Diesel is a heavy fuel and in the winter when people are using more (heavy) heating oil, the cost of diesel goes up. In the summer, when people are using less heavy fuel and more gasoline for their cars, mowers, boats, etc., the cost of gasoline goes up. Ergo, supply and demand. I'm pretty sure I learned this in elementary school. Where's the coverage of fallen troops? As a reader of The Blade, I was very sorry to read about Officer Keith Dressel getting killed in the line of duty, but enough is enough. We had to see on TV a solid week about his funeral, and read about it every day, and still we hear about him and his family. It was his job! What about our soldiers getting killed in the line of duty? One hundred and four were killed in the Iraq war in April. You reported it like, ho-hum, another bunch killed. Does anyone think or even care about the families they left behind?

No such luck: instead of kicking off the final battle for dominion over the universe, the billionaires traded limp platitudes about how much the other has contributed to the technology industry. "I'd give a lot to have Steve's taste," said Gates, as he sat next to a man wearing a turtleneck, stonewashed jeans, and grey trainers. In return, Jobs admired Microsoft's history of beating on its partners for cash: "I think if Apple could have had a little more of that in its DNA, it would have served it extremely well." They joined their wizardly powers to pump "post PC devices" - PDAs and their ilk - while predicting the resilience of the personal computing era. Beyond that, the session stayed on the safe territory of the Apple vs Microsoft memory lane, latterly pedestrianised by Redmond's new Googlier nemesis in Mountain View, and Apple's dropping of "Computer" from its name to confirm its rebirth as a consumer electronics maker. The occasional rehearsed quip about Apple's anti-PC ad campaign, or satirical blogger , was about as entertaining as the encounter got. Not that it will bother D5's organisers, the name brand columnists Walter Mossberg and Kara Swisher: the high-priced conference was attended by about 600 tech executives, and probably a similar number of enthralled reporters. Gates' and Jobs' joint appearance was their first since a looming projection of the Microsoft man was booed by Apple fanboys at MacWorld in 1997. In a misty-eyed summation of the dynamic duo's role as high kings of tech, Jobs uncorked a cute soundbite in tribute to their omniscience. Invoking his new best chums The Beatles by quoting , while also referencing Gates' 1995 crystal ball-gazing tome , he said: "You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead." The conference has provided a selection of "rip-roaring laughs" from the head to head in a highlights reel . For those who feel their spleen might burst if they watch the pair's relentless gagsmithing edited together, the entire spectacle is also available as a seven-chapter epic. &reg; Post a new comment Ruddy Hell!

Okay, maybe nobody ever actually speculated about that last one but the point is that PSP firmware updates are ten a penny these days and yet none of them seem to really change much about the console. (Read our How To to upgrade your PSP firmware feature if this is all new to you). The latest, version 3.5, is particularly unexciting. The full list of changes is as follows: Support has been added to allow over the Internet in 'Remote Play'. 'Communication setting' has been added to the Remote Play menu. 'RSS Channel Guide' has been added as a feature under 'RSS Channel'. The remote play option is admittedly very cool ( if somewhat over due ) but it's only of benefit to those who own a PlayStation 3. As for the RSS feed updates, they are hardly going to convince any PSP fence-sitters to part with their cash any time soon.

Stellar Emery not enough for Sens Rodriguez helps talk Yankees into a win Planting trees good for the conscience Jobs and Gates trade jests at rare joint appearance Published:Â Thursday, California (Reuters) - It turns out that Steve Jobs has a soft spot in his heart for PC guys. "PC guy is great, he's got a big heart," the chief of Apple Inc. said on Wednesday, referring to popular television ads in which a hip young man personifies a Macintosh computer and a Windows PC is played by an awkward middle-aged man. Apple Corporation Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs introduces the new operating system, OS 10.5 "Leopard" to the crowd at the Apple 2006 Worldwide Development Conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, California, in this August 7, 2006 file photo. Jobs and Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates appeared in their first joint interview in 14 years on Wednesday .REUTERS/Dino Vournas Email to a friend "The art of those commercials is not to be mean, but it's actually for the guys to like each other," Jobs said. His generous interpretation might have had something to do with the fact that Jobs was sitting next to Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates in their first joint interview in 14 years. Gates rolled with the joke, saying of the PC guy: "His mother loves him!" It was one of several light moments in a highly anticipated meeting of the two computer industry titans at an annual technology conference run by the Wall Street Journal. Anyone hoping for a bruising showdown between the computer industry's richest executive and one many regard as its coolest would have been disappointed. Jobs, 52, and Gates, 51, reminisced about the industry and old partnerships. The tone was jovial, even sentimental, but Jobs did get in a few good-natured digs. At one point, Gates said employees working on Microsoft's Zune portable media player admired Apple for creating the market for such devices with its hugely successful iPod line. "And we love them because they're all customers!" countered Jobs. Jobs, a boyhood electronics ace, and Gates, a programming prodigy, have seen their once-intense rivalry mellow in recent years, but the history of mutual antagonism is the stuff of legend and was even immortalized in a 1999 TV movie, "Pirates of Silicon Valley." Wednesday's event came almost exactly 10 years after a landmark 1997 deal that saw Microsoft take a financial stake in Apple and pledge to keep making software for Macs, an arrangement that helped pull the struggling company back from the brink of failure. One of the more bizarre moments on Wednesday came when the two were asked if their rivalry had been overblown. "We've kept our marriage secret for over a decade now," Jobs said, to roars of laughter. Gates appeared flummoxed. Jobs did offer two tidbits about upcoming Apple products. He hinted that ".mac" -- the company's package of online services like e-mail and Web storage for Mac users -- is about to undergo a big overhaul. After a questioner suggested .mac had failed to live up to lofty expectations, Jobs said: "I couldn't agree with you more. We'll make up for lost time in the near future." Known for his showmanship, Jobs also enthused about the map software Apple created for its iPhone, which is scheduled to hit the market later this month. "The (application) we were able to write ... blows away any Google Maps client." Jobs said, referring to the Web search company that provided some technology for the map software.

Thousands of YouTube videos will be available to Apple TV from mid-June; however, the full catalogue will not be viewable until Autumn. YouTube users will be able to log into their YouTube accounts via Apple TV and save their favourites and subscribe to video streams. Jobs said: This is the first time users can easily browse, find and watch YouTube videos right from their living room couch. This move by Apple may help bring the Apple TV from a niche product to a competitor. Currently users are restricted in that they can only wirelessly stream iTunes content on to their Apple TV. However, the appeal may be limited given the low quality of YouTubes Flash videos and the fact that they cannot be saved onto the Apple TV or your PC. YouTube content will be piped directly to Apple TV from a wireless router, bypassing your computer and iTunes. YouTube is currently being sued for US$1.1bn by Viacom for violation of copyright, due to the vast amount of user-uploaded Viacom material freely distributed on the video sharing site. However, a spokesperson for Viacom, commenting in relation to this new offering by Apple TV, said that the company welcomed an opportunity to license their content to Apple.

Apple's bold gamble could push the rest of the music industry into offering DRM-free music. Staff Writer, CNET News.com Published: May 31, 2007, 4:00 AM PDT Apple has plunged into uncharted waters by stripping security software off some of its music. Never before has Apple sold songs without attaching antipiracy software--the digital rights management systems that prevent file sharing and are hated by many music fans. If successful, Apple's bold gamble to do away with digital rights management, or DRM, could act as a whirlpool that sucks the rest of the music industry into DRM-free music, say analysts. Apple's iTunes music store begins selling MP3s that are unprotected by digital rights management software. If the move succeeds, the major record labels might follow suit and strip copy-protection software from their music offerings. More stories on this topic Apple on Wednesday began selling unprotected MP3s from record label EMI. Shoppers have the option to purchase either a 256kbps AAC-encoded DRM-free song for $1.29 via iTunes Plus, or the usual 128kbps AAC-encoded DRM version for 99 cents. The move is important on many levels. For the first time, consumers can play music from Apple's iTunes on digital players other than the iPod. For Apple, offering DRM-free songs could hand the company some credibility in dealings with European regulators, who want the company to open up iTunes to third-party hardware makers. For the record industry, it once again may find itself being herded into a direction of Apple's choosing. In this situation, the record companies can only benefit, said Greg Scholl, president and CEO of The Orchard, a New York-based music distribution and marketing company. "The only way we're going to discover the right way to grow the market is by experimenting," Scholl said. "I think the price Apple is charging is still too high and will probably inhibit (sales). But right now there isn't enough data to know what the right pricing is or how to market digital music. At least Apple is trying something new." It's important to note that the music being offered without copy protection by Apple and EMI represents only a fraction of the most popular music. The majority of Apple's 5 million songs still feature Apple's FairPlay DRM scheme. EMI is the only one of the four top record labels to release unprotected music. The other four account for 70 percent of the world's music. While Apple said it expects half of its music to be available on the site without DRM, most of it likely would be the millions of songs iTunes offers from independent labels. Curiously, Apple didn't exactly ballyhoo the new service. The company on Wednesday placed an advertisement on iTunes' front door amid a handful of other promotions. Customers must also first upgrade to the latest addition of iTunes in order to obtain EMI's unprotected songs. That DRM-free music wasn't promoted heavily worried Scholl. "I would think that if you're a major label and you don't want something to work, the best plan would be to hide it," Scholl said. Even the staunchest DRM proponent must recognize that copy-protection software is losing some momentum. Two weeks ago, Amazon.com--the fourth largest distributor of music online--announced that a new digital music store due to open soon would also . Industry insiders told CNET News.com that they expected other top e-tailers to soon try out DRM-free music. . Immediately after CEO Steve Jobs issued his February letter calling for an end to DRM , Microsoft said the total abolition of such protections would be irresponsible since they are needed for subscription music and other new business models. But the company reversed itself in April and announced plans to offer DRM-free music from EMI and others. What Apple has succeeded in doing is to raise questions about how the music industry is pursing its digital music strategy, said Susan Kevorkian, an IDC analyst. Chief among the questions is why the record labels place copy protection on digital songs but not on CDs. Gates, Jobs share stage, memories Why Google shows developers the love Will labels hum along with DRM-free iTunes? Extra: Sci-fi writers join war on terror "CD specifications never included native content protection," Kevorkian said. "New CDs purchased today aren't protected either so there's been this inconsistency in the music industry's strategy. When you have an unprotected CD, you can rip songs to MP3s and do with them what you want. We think that by pursuing a more consistent digital strategy the potential is there to reach more consumers." The record industry has said in the past that placing copy protections on CDs is expensive. The format was developed long before the digital age or the "consumer-oriented Internet" emerged, said one record executive who asked for anonymity because she was not authorized to speak for her company. Regardless, Apple's DRM-free offering shows how easily the company can put the record industry on the defensive. What happens if DRM-free music on Apple becomes popular? Kevorkian suggests the music industry start worrying less about fighting piracy and more about profiting from downloads. "They can try new strategies around prices and marketingï¿?particular to older buyers," Kevorkian said. "There are different paths to go down to drive music sales and those paths are better than what we've seen to date."

The search engine behemoth marked out clear intentions to enter territory dominated by Microsoft by offering free, open source technology that works without an internet connection. Gears will run online and offline, allowing users to access data normally only available when plugged into the web. Google already offers its own web-based docs and spreadsheets product to its users and said it plans to introduce programs including email, calendars, and word processing to its millions of users via the off-line browser extension software. Google said it is keen to build "next generation web applications" and hopes to work closely with developers in the open source community to drum up new ways and means of delivering software to its users. The firm said a Javascript API library is now available via its web toolkit facility which will support the new add-on so developers can start exploring offline capabilities with Gears. Google CEO Eric Schmidt said: "With 'Google Gears' we are tackling a key limitation of the browser in order to make it a stronger platform for deploying all types of applications, and enabling a better user experience. "We believe strongly in the power of the community to stretch this new technology to the limits of what's possible, and ultimately emerge with an open standard that benefits everyone." According to various reports, Adobe Systems supports the new technology and is already developing its own version. Browser makers Mozilla and Opera were also said to be keen to get involved with Gears. The announcement coincided with Google Developer Day, which is taking place today at 10 cities around the world including Moscow, London, and Beijing where a whole range of Google products are being trumpeted by the firm.

Clicking on the YouTube menu gives AppleTV users access to YouTube content, streamed directly off the Internet. In another sense it&#39;s very surprising, since Apple TV seemed clearly designed to be a vehicle for playing back videos purchased on the iTunes Store, given its lack of support for popular video CODECs like DivX/Xvid. After Steve&#39;s speech, Apple also issued a press release indicating that Apple TV would get a new BTO (build to order) option, offering a 160GB internal hard drive (instead of the standard 40GB). As an Apple TV owner (more on that later) I&#39;m not sure the 160GB is necessary given the ease at which content can be streamed directly from your iTunes library, though it does address a complaint from many reviewers. This update should also quell some of the AppleTV naysayers into submission, and is a sign that Apple intends to open their borders to content that they feel suits the new TV medium. In the Q&A style interview with Walt Mossberg, Steve Jobs hinted that eventually users would be able to purchase and stream other content, but at the moment Apple feels iTunes is still the best interface to manage media. Apple also announced the immediate availability of , its DRM free music offering. If you&#39;ve already used iTunes to buy music, check out the new section as you may be able to &#39;upgrade&#39; your old 128kbps AAC files to the new 256kbps DRM free version.

As always, the seamless upgrade simply replaces your content and moves your old DRM&#39;d files in to the trash (where they belonged all the time?) Later today Steve Jobs is also going with Bill Gates in a much anticipated bout on the D5 stage. Most analysts are expecting the pair to get down and dirty.

Google Earth already displays images from the Panoramio - its photos have been a default layer in Google Earth since the beginning of the year - using location data entered by the site's users. The site also provides an API that enables web developers to embed its functionality into their own websites. In a brief statement on its homepage, Panoramio said that the deal should be concluded by the end of June. 'Today, we are pleased to announce the planned acquisition of Panoramio by Google,' it said. 'This acquisition is a great opportunity for Panoramio uploaders to leverage Google's reach, increasing the exposure of their photographs to photophiles around the world and for viewers to choose from a larger universe of photographs as Panoramio becomes more widely known.' In true Web 2.0 fashion, Google announced the takeover in its blog. John Hanke, director for Maps, Earth and Local said that images layer in Google Earth would remain in place 'as our teams work together toward further integrating this amazing content, generated by many, into our mapping technologies.' Panoramio is not alone in enabling geotagging of images to link them to maps and satellite images. Yahoo!, for one, offers a similar service to users of its Flickr website.

It is set among exhibits on frogs and lizards, across from a gift shop and a diorama of life in ancient times. But this is something different: the Creation Museum, a $27 million destination that brings a new level of high-tech polish to anti-evolution argument. The text below the display case says scientists are "puzzled" by the varieties of finches. "The Bible provides the explanation," the text continues. "In the beginning of time, six thousand years ago, God created every kind of bird, including the finch kind, and He gave them the ability to 'multiply on the Earth.' " The 60,000-square-foot museum, which opened this week on 49 acres of lush Kentucky countryside, is the work of Answers in Genesis, a leader in the "young Earth" creationist movement. Unlike proponents of intelligent design -- who question aspects of evolutionary theory but may accept that the universe is billions of years old -- members of "young Earth" groups insist that the Book of Genesis is an accurate historical record. Because history began only 6,000 years ago, they argue, dinosaurs discovered in the fossil record must have coexisted with humans. In the diorama that greets museum visitors, models of baby T. rexes cavort among animatronic children clad in buckskin. Dinosaurs, in fact, are all over the Creation Museum: Visitors can plunk down $29.99 for a plastic apatosaurus in the gift shop. Their kids will be able to saddle up on the back of a model triceratops by the coffee bar. "Kids are fascinated by them," said Ken Ham, president of Answers in Genesis, who says the creatures have too long been used as propaganda for the evolutionist cause. "We like to say, 'You've captured them for evolution, and we're going to take them back,' " Ham said. The museum, with its flat-screen TVs, coffee bar and special-effects theater, is an attempt to go mainstream with an idea that has been widely discredited by modern science. And that is a concern for defenders of evolutionary theory. Campaign to Defend the Constitution, a project of the Tides Center that advocates science education and the separation of church and state, recently compared the museum to cigarette ads focusing on the young. "This is to science what Joe Camel was to health -- a crass marketing ploy that cynically preys on the impressionable minds of children," campaign co-director Clark Stevens said in a statement. Ham, a former Australian schoolteacher who founded his ministry in 1979, said he simply wants people to "think about the origins issue" in a new way. "You have secular museums in every major city that treat evolution as fact, and public schools around this nation treating evolution as fact, and they're worried about one Creation Museum? "If evolution is so obvious," he said with a smile, "why are they so worried?" Ham believes many modern Christians have strayed from the basic tenets of their faith because they learned in school that evolution, not Genesis, provided the best blueprint for the story of creation. Creationists already boast one smaller museum, called the Museum of Creation and Earth History, in Santee (San Diego County), as well as a number of roadside attractions in the region. The Kentucky museum takes creationist tourism to a new level. Its chief designer, Patrick Marsh, designed the "Jaws" and "King Kong" attractions at Florida's Universal Studios. Organizers are expecting to attract 250,000 yearly visitors, who will pay $9.95 to $19.95 for a ticket. Beyond the diorama of the dinosaurs and children is a reproduction of a narrow slot canyon from the Grand Canyon. A video on a flat-screen television asks "Have you ever wondered where canyons come from?" laying the groundwork for a recurring assertion: that the Grand Canyon was not carved out over millions of years by the Colorado River, but by a rush of water created by the great flood described in Genesis. The Answers in Genesis group believes the story of the ark to be literally true. After the ark ran aground in Central Asia, the museum says, the surviving animals repopulated the other continents by floating across the oceans on the "billions of trees" uprooted by the great deluge. It is those kinds of assertions that make scientists such as Lawrence Krauss laugh out loud. "That's remarkable," said Krauss, a physicist and astronomer at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. "Any child knows that when they make up a story, and unfortunately make up the facts, they have to make up more and more excuses to justify those facts."

Microsoft Surface, which has a 30-inch display under a hard-plastic tabletop, allows a group of people to touch and move objects on screen at once. Microsoft is to unveil a coffee-table-shaped "surface computer" today in a major step towards co-founder Bill Gates' view of a future where the mouse and keyboard are replaced by more natural interaction using voice, pen and touch. Microsoft Surface, which has a 76cm (30-inch) display under a hard-plastic tabletop, allows people to touch and move objects on screen for everything from digital finger painting and jigsaw puzzles to ordering off a virtual menu in a restaurant. It also recognises and interacts with devices placed on its surface, so cell phone users can easily buy ringtones or change payment plans by placing their handsets on in-store displays, or a group of people gathered round the table can check out the photos on a digital camera placed on top. The world's largest software maker said it will manufacture the machine itself and sell it initially to corporate customers, deploying the first units in November in Sheraton hotels, Harrah's casinos, T-Mobile stores, and restaurants. The company is selling the Surface for between $US5,000 ($NZ6972) and $US10,000 ($NZ13,945) each, but aims to bring prices down to consumer levels in three to five years and introduce various shapes and forms. "We see this as a multibillion dollar category, and we envision a time when surface computing technologies will be pervasive, from tabletops and counters to the hallway mirror," chief executive Steve Ballmer said in a statement. Analysts say the first few applications only hint at what is possible. "The potential for the interface is huge," said Matt Rosoff, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft, an independent research firm. "Once you open it up to applications, what you can think of is limitless." Microsoft held demonstrations of the technology last week and Ballmer will officially introduce it at the Wall Street Journal's "D: All Things Digital" conference on Thursday (NZT). Microsoft shunned its usual PC manufacturing partners and decided to take control of the surface computer's hardware production using an undisclosed contract manufacturer. It will run the Windows Vista operating system. Microsoft has a mixed record with new technology. Its Zune music player has not yet become a major challenger to Apple Inc's iPod, but its Xbox 360 game console has enjoyed early success in the battle of next-generation game machines. For years Gates has championed touch-screen technology such as the tablet PC with little success, but the Surface is a totally different shape and allows for multiple users at once. In a demonstration, Microsoft placed a digital camera with a wireless chip on the tabletop. The Surface recognised the camera and sent its pictures to the display, allowing people around the table to sift through them, grabbing and turning pictures or making them bigger or smaller by spreading or narrowing their fingers. Microsoft showed in another demonstration how Deutsche Telekom cell phone operator T-Mobile USA, one of its launch partners, could deploy the computer in its stores. A customer can grab a phone off the shelf, place it on the tabletop where it will recognize the device and pop up the handset's specifications and information to the screen. For a side-by-side comparison with another phone, the customer can put down a second handset next to the first phone. "It's drop-dead simple and people really like it, because it mimics what they do in the real world," said Pete Thompson, general manager of Microsoft's surface computing business. Microsoft said at launch it will deploy a virtual concierge for Harrah's Entertainment Inc's casinos in Las Vegas and place the surface computers in the lobbies of Starwood Hotel & Resorts Worldwide Inc's Sheraton hotels. It also signed a distribution and development agreement with slot-machine maker International Game Technology.

Part of the international space station since 2000, Zvezda is only now having shields installed to fend off dangerous space junk (Image: NASA TV) New report highlights threats to space station New spacecraft fuel gauge may reduce space junk World's only space dust detector binned Two crew members ventured from the international space station on Wednesday to install metal shields designed to protect against the impact of orbital debris. Station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov floated out of an airlock on the Russian side of the station at 15.05 EDT (19.05 GMT), about an hour later than planned, due to a glitch with communications equipment. They were back inside about five and a half hours later. During the outing, the cosmonauts fitted five aluminium debris impact shields to the forward part of the crew's living quarters, a Russian-built module known as Zvezda that has been in orbit for seven years. The shields measure about 60 by 90 centimetres, and weigh up to 9 kilograms. Yurchikhin and Kotov also rerouted cables for satellite-navigation equipment that will be needed when Europe's uncrewed cargo ship makes its debut flight to the station later this year. NASA wants the Russian module upgraded to meet US safety standards. It was launched despite substandard shielding after Russia and the United States agreed to upgrade the structure once it was in orbit. That work began in 2002, but was interrupted by the 2003 Columbia disaster and subsequent grounding of the space shuttle fleet. Yurchikhin and Kotov have another spacewalk planned for June 6 to finish installing the shields, which are designed to protect against small and medium-sized particles of debris. At 17,500 miles per hour (28,162 kilometres per hour) even something as small as a fleck of paint can cause severe damage to the station. An impact with orbital debris "is our biggest risk," said Kirk Shireman, NASA's space station deputy programme manager. Other shielding upgrades to Russian-made station components are pending. If all the improvements are made, the chance a piece of debris or a micrometeoroid would puncture the station drops to 29 per cent from 55 per cent over its expected 15-year life, according to an independent task force report published in February.

Surface, a table-style PC with a touch-sensitive screen which replaces a traditional mouse and keyboard, was unveiled in California yesterday. Using a so-called "multi-touch" interface, people can move items around in front of them with their fingers or write on the table using a pen. The device, which measures 75cm (30in) across, may echo some of the earliest computer games built into the surface of pub tables, but Microsoft hopes it will launch a new generation of computers. Steve Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, said: "We envision a time when surface computing technologies will be pervasive, from tabletops and counters to the hallway mirror." The Surface table can interact with other devices such as mobile phones, music players and digital cameras. Users can place compatible gadgets on to the table and have the computer recognise them wirelessly. Matt Rosoff, an analyst with independent research group Directions on Microsoft, said: "Once you open it up to applications, what you can think of is limitless." The Surface will go on sale in the US later this year with a price tag of between $5,000 and $10,000 (&pound;2,026- &pound;5,041). But Microsoft claims that the price will drop quickly as more people buy it. Within three to five years it could be cheap enough for home users, although initially it is expected to be bought by large companies. Starwood hotels, which owns the Sheraton chain, has said it will install the Surface at its premises, and other early takers include the Las Vegas casino group Harrah's and mobile phone operator T-Mobile, which plans to use Surface PCs as displays in its high street shops. Touch screen computers have long been tipped as the next big thing, and a series of developments have pushed the technology to the forefront in recent months, including the forthcoming iPhone from Apple, which features a touchable screen instead of the buttons usually found on a mobile phone. The Surface machine can recognise several different touches at the same time, allowing people to use multiple fingers or have several people using the computer simultaneously. Stephen Brewster, of the University of Glasgow's department of computing science, said: "Using a PC is very much a solitary activity, but there's something very tangible about having something that you can share with other people."

Google to Buy Panoramio Google is acquiring Panoramio, a photo sharing site that lets user upload photos and identify where they were taken. Part 1 of a special five-part series. James Niccolai, IDG News Service Thursday, AM PDT Google Inc. is acquiring Panoramio, a photo-sharing Web site based in Spain that lets people upload photos and identify where they were taken by placing them on Google Earth or Google Maps, where they can be viewed by the public. The companies have already been working together since the start of the year, when Google made Panoramio the default photo layer for Google Earth. Panoramio has seen its usage surge since then, recently passing 1 million "geo-located" photos. In a blog posting Wednesday, Google said it was buying the company to integrate its services more closely with its own -- although it isn't saying exactly how yet -- and to boost its own technical resources. It should also help to strengthen Panoramio's infrastructure, leading to more reliable service for end users. Financial terms of the acquisition, which is pending, were not disclosed. Google said it planned to keep operating the site for now and that there won't be any immediate changes for Panoramio's users. The move should help to strengthen Google's position against Yahoo Inc. for providing online photo services. Yahoo owns the popular Flickr photo-sharing service, whose users can also locate their photos on Google Earth, although they don't appear as the default layer. Panoramio said it was "very (and we mean very) happy" to be acquired by Google. "To watch our little project grow since its conception one and a half years ago has been an amazing experience," cofounder Eduardo Manchsn wrote in a blog posting. Panoramio was launched in October 2005. About 300,000 people had signed up for the service as of March this year, and in February the site had 4 million unique visitors and 30 million page views, according to Panoramio. The company released an API (application programming interface) recently that lets other Web sites include Panoramio functionality in their site. It gave its users the option to remove all their photos and personal data before they are transferred to Google. / 1000 max characters MySpace&#039;s Parent to Buy Photobucket Google Revamps Korean Site Cisco Completes WebEx Buy FTC Investigating Google-DoubleClick Deal Google Buys Security Software Maker BMC to Buy ProactiveNet Novell: Microsoft Deal Is Good for Linux Novell says its deal with Microsoft is helping its Linux business.

The technology, called Google Gears, is intended to allow users of computers, phones and other devices to manipulate web services such as e-mail, online calendars or news readers whether online, intermittently connected to the Web or offline. By apparently bridging the gulf between new web services and the older world of desktop software, where any data changes are stored locally on users' machines, Google is pushing the web into whole new spheres of activity and posing a challenge to rival Microsoft, leader in the desktop software era. "The web is great but it doesn't work very well when you don't have a web connection. Gears addresses a functional gap," Jeff Huber, Google's vice president of engineering, said. Google plans to make the Gears technology available for free as "open source" software, meaning other developers are free to use and enhance the software in their own products. Gears promises to expand the usage of scores of Google products and services, as well as thousands of programs from independent software makers, by making them more accessible at previously inconvenient times and places. The technology also allows developers to build internet search and indexing of web pages into their own software applications, Mr Huber said. Many such products will be able to make limited searches offline, since they will have downloaded data automatically when connected. Google's full web search functions would return once the user reconnects to the Internet. Early partners who will use Gears in their products include design software leader Adobe, maker of Flash animation and Acrobat document-sharing software.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-mooney/of-idiocy-and-optimal-cli_b_50109.html&cid Chris Mooney: Of Idiocy and Optimal Climates | The Huffington Post Of Idiocy and Optimal Climates or less everywhere. NASA administrator Michael Griffin made this mind-boggling statement to NPR: I have no doubt that a trend of global warming exists. I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with. To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn't change. I guess I would ask which human beings -- where and when -- are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take. To be fair to Griffin, there's the germ of an interesting point here. Climate varied dramatically in past eras of the Earth's history. And these variations in climate have most assuredly favored some parts of the world at the expense of others. Ongoing global warming is, inevitably, going to have the same effect. There are going to be at least some winners, along with all the losers. So far so good. But as the blog Prometheus , what Griffin is ignoring is the whole issue of risk and its distribution. Our global society is set up for--adapted to--the current climate. But now we're moving in the direction of raising the sea level considerably--even as much of the global population is coastal--and melting large amounts of ice, while also altering the occurrence of phenomena, such as droughts, that could have a dramatic impact on food and water supplies. How can anyone think this is not a tremendous societal risk, even if there might be some people--in, say, Buffalo, New York--who may actually have more pleasant weather under global warming? NASA is already backtracking. James Hansen, the agency's top climatologist, is . Assuredly there will be many more jeers and groans over the course of the day. But let's not forget the big picture. Michael Griffin said something obtuse in one press interview. But the Bush administration has more or less acted, for seven years, as if it agrees with him.

(AP / Ed Reinke) 'Twenty-seven million dollars could have gone towards a lot of other things other than propping up a fairy tale,' said one man. Eugenie Scott of the U.S. National Center for Science Education. Bible-based creation museum has dinosaurs Updated Mon. May. 28 2007 11:32 PM ET A new theme park that features the Bible as a literal story, albeit one in which children cavort with dinosaurs, has opened in northern Kentucky. "We wanted to show people there's no mystery with dinosaurs, we can explain them," said Ken Ham, founder of the Answers in Genesis Ministry. The non-profit group created the US$27 million Creation Museum, but protestors said the money could have been better spent. "Twenty-seven million dollars could have gone towards a lot of other things other than propping up a fairy tale," said one man. The dinosaur exhibit is at odds with scientists who say that the massive lizards existed tens of millions of years before man. In the literal interpretation of the Bible, however, dinosaurs were created by God at the same time as all the other animals just a few thousand years ago. "People are just fascinated by dinosaurs, but they've sort of become synonymous with millions of years and evolution," Ham said. The 5,600-square-metre facility rebuts the theory of evolution. Ham claims the Bible's stories about the world being created in six days are supported by science. At the website of the Royal Tyrrell Museum in the fossil hotbed of Drumheller, Alta., it says, "There's been life on Earth for more than 3.9 billion years, so we have a lot to show you!" One exhibit offers a chance to view "a giant recreation of underwater life from 350 million years ago." While the Tyrrell museum has dinosaur skeletons, Ham hired Patrick Marsh, who designed the "Jaws" monster at Universal Studios in Florida, to oversee the animatronic exhibits, including dinosaurs. Eugenie Scott of the U.S. National Center for Science Education fears students who visit the Creation Museum will "show up in classrooms and say, 'gee, Mrs. Brown, I went to this spiffy museum last summer and they say that everything you're teaching me is a lie." The museum contains fossils, but Ham said most were created by the massive flood described in the book of Genesis. "They can believe whatever they want to believe about when dinosaurs were created and when humans were created," said Jeffrey McKee, an anthropologist at Ohio State University. "The fact is that dinosaurs went extinct long before humans were around." Ham is originally from Australia and began developing the idea of a creationist museum in the early 1990s. Donations have been sufficient to allow the museum to open debt-free. "Christians across this nation see this place as a rallying point," Ham said. They "recognize that we live in a culture that no longer believes the Bible is true."

Likewise, there's been a lot of speculation as to how security and privacy are going to be dealt with on the social networking sites that draw information from these web apps.Â Â  I saw this at work earlier this week with the announcement of the alpha launch of social networking site at Where 2.0. As if the standard security issues aren't tricky enough when it comes to the average site, Fatdoor's mashup of Live Earth aerial images with wiki versions of users' neighborhoods has a lot of hand wringing going on. To address these issues I went straight to the source and had a chat with Fatdoor CEO Raj Abhyanker yesterday afternoon about the security protocols that the site has in place. A lot of the potential problems I posed in an are common concerns according to Abhyanker, but he assured me that he's done his homework.Â  "The thing that really gets people feeling uneasy is seeing an icon on the map. They instantly think that their icon is going to float over their actual street address, but that's not the case. . .we actually have less information displayed than Google's white pages," said Abhyanker. It wasn't until Abhyanker let me take his neighborhood for a test drive that I started to understand how this actually plays out. Fatdoor is hardly the stalking tool we all feared. In fact, its simple interface made Abhyanker's own community fit together more like a wiki version of a town hall. Users in the neighborhood can broadcast general messages to the entire block, submit an entry about a local business, or even submit entries for friends and other neighbors. Abhyanker's neighborhood is even set up to elect moderators to help police this conduct too. Paired with the amount of control the user has over how much or how little information the neighborhood can access about themselves, it actually seemed....pretty safe. As far as peeking into other neighborhoods? Abhyanker has that covered too. "We've been playing around with the distance, and after some testing we've found that keeping it at a 5 mile radius [from the user's residence] is the most reasonable," he said. "It keeps the focus on the neighborhood and also keeps the feeling of community. Of course, this is something that we're going to have to change depending on the size and layout of a city, but during testing it seemed like the ideal distance." With that said, it'll be interesting to see how Abhyanker's social experiment comes together. Although social networking sites like Myspace and Facebook are great for connecting people, few have attempted to tackle the relevance of building out the social networks right outside our doorsteps. Still, it's good to know that even though Abhyanker and his crew have decided to bring social networking a little closer to home, you can still draw the blinds every once in a while.

Feature Wars Intensify in Mapping Tech May 30, 2007 9:34AM With Microsoft introducing new 3D map options and Google rolling out Street View mapping technology, some are wondering what the possible ROI for these features might be. According to analyst Greg Sterling, the steady introduction of new mapping features is driven to a large extent by competition rather than by an expectation of revenue. Feds Arrest 'Spam King' in Seattle IRS Spoof Targets Execs Through RTF CDW Accepts $7.3 Billion To Go Private Palm Foleo: A 'Smartphone Companion' Samsung Debuts 4-GB Mobile Chipset According to the great British satirist Douglas Adams, the stages of a civilization can be summarized in three questions: 1. How can we eat? (Survival); 2. Why do we eat? (Inquiry); and 3. Where shall we have lunch? (Sophistication). It's the last of those questions -- the search for a good place to eat -- that is driving the most recent Web battle: the push to make online mapping services increasingly sophisticated and user-friendly. Both Google, which operates Google Maps, and , which runs Live Search Maps, announced new features on Tuesday that are designed to help users plan trips, get previews of where they are going, and, most importantly, find businesses that might be persuaded to advertise with the mapping services. Two weeks ago, Google signaled the intensity of its work in this area by launching the Google Lat Long Blog, devoted specifically to the company's work on its maps, Google Earth, its local map service, and related APIs. "Things are changing so fast," said John Hanke, the Director of Google Earth and Maps, in the blog's initial post, "we thought a blog focused on this topic would be the best way to communicate with you, both about our products and about the overall development of geo on the Web." At the Where 2.0 conference on Tuesday, Hanke rolled out two new Google developments: "Street View" and "Mapplets." The Street View feature offers map users 360 degree images of streets in various urban areas around the country. Initially, images are available for portions of the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver, and Miami, with other areas to be added later. If street level views are available for a particular area, a new button labeled "Street View" will appear on the Google map. Users can click on the image, pan in every direction, and even move forward or back, creating the illusion of walking down the street. The other feature introduced by Google, Mapplets, is designed to help developers and consumers create mini-applications that can be embedded on Google Maps to provide information or perform simple tasks. Three sample applications demonstrated by Google included real estate listings, movie times, and a distance-measurement tool. In its press release, Google said that several of its partners, including WeatherBug and Booking.com, have already created customized Mapplets. "Maps are an enormously popular application," said Greg Sterling, an Internet search analyst and founder of Sterling Market Intelligence. "They've proven to draw millions of users. In fact, Google Maps may be its most successful product, apart from search. These new features are designed to reinforce that usage."

In an interview broadcast this morning on National Public Radio's "Morning Edition" program, Griffin was asked by NPR's Steve Inskeep whether he is concerned about global warming. "I have no doubt that a trend of global warming exists," Griffin told Inskeep. "I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with." "To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn't change," Griffin said. "I guess I would ask which human beings â where and when â are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take." Griffin's comments immediately drew stunned reaction from James Hansen, NASA's top climate scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. "It's an incredibly arrogant and ignorant statement," Hansen told ABC News. "It indicates a complete ignorance of understanding the implications of climate change." Hansen believes Griffin's comments fly in the face of well-established scientific knowledge that hundreds of NASA scientists have contributed to. "It's unbelievable," said Hansen. "I thought he had been misquoted. It's so unbelievable." News media inquiries to NASA headquarters about Griffin's comments prompted the space agency to make the unusual move of issuing a news release late Wednesday night. "NASA is the world's preeminent organization in the study of Earth and the conditions that contribute to climate change and global warming," Griffin said in a statement. "The agency is responsible for collecting data that is used by the science community and policy makers as part of an ongoing discussion regarding our planet's evolving systems. It is NASA's responsibility to collect, analyze and release information. It is not NASA's mission to make policy regarding possible climate change mitigation strategies. As I stated in the NPR interview, we are proud of our role and I believe we do it well."

http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-whales31may31,0,5041629.story%3Fcoll%3Dla-home-center&cid Once-wayward humpbacks appear to be home free - Los Angeles Times 9:13 AM PDT, Sell & More Deals at Local Stores California | Local News Once-wayward humpbacks appear to be home free With no whales in sight, experts assume that the mother and calf have safely made it back to the Pacific. By Eric Bailey, Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTO &#8212; They came, they wandered, they went. After a 17-day sojourn in Northern California's inland waterways, two wayward humpback whales that caught the attention of the nation appear to have quietly slipped back into the Pacific Ocean. By late Wednesday, nearly 24 hours after they were last sighted off the Marin County town of Tiburon, the mother and her calf were nowhere to be seen. Most of the experts mounting a rescue operation concluded that the pair had found their way back to their ocean home. A pair of patrol boats from the U.S. Coast Guard and California Department of Fish and Game hunted the waters off the coast for any sign of the pair, while vessels crisscrossing San Francisco Bay were asked to notify authorities of any sighting. Not a tail slap, spout or sky-scratching breach was seen. "They arrived here quietly, and if they've made their way outside the Golden Gate, they've gone out quietly," said Bernadette Fees, a state Fish and Game spokeswoman. First spotted swimming languidly May 13, the pair arrived in the Sacramento River sporting deep gashes likely inflicted by a run-in with a ship. They wandered into a deep-water shipping channel and into the Port of Sacramento, meandering 70 miles from the sea. In the days that followed, whale experts from around the nation descended on the area to lend a hand. The rescue team received thousands of e-mails and calls from the public, expressing concern and offering suggestions. Northern Californians took off workdays to perch on riverbank levees to get a glimpse. Experts faced a tough balance between giving the whales room to relax and heal and trying to persuade them to head back to their natural saline environment, where their wounds would better heal. The rescue team used clanking pipes, recordings of killer whales and even the geyser spray of a fireboat in an unsuccessful bid to prod the whales past what became their biggest obstacle &#8212; a bustling bridge at Rio Vista. Scientists grew worried late last week as the pair's health continued to deteriorate. By the weekend, the team resorted to administering a dose of antibiotics &#8212; a first for whales in the wild &#8212; delivered with foot-long syringes shot from a .22-caliber rifle. They prepared to launch a massive post-Memorial Day push to move the whales. The whales beat them to the punch. On Sunday, they made their break amid the buzz of holiday jet skiers and boaters on the river. Over three days, they moved purposefully down the river, through the narrow Carquinez Strait and into San Francisco Bay. Seeming to gain vigor, the 20-foot-long juvenile put on a display of leaps and tail slaps as if at play. Tara Cahn, a Sausalito architect, jumped in her car upon learning that the whales were swimming along the Marin County coast. After a few wrong turns, she finally tracked them down Tuesday evening about a quarter-mile offshore of Tiburon. "They were bouncing around, they were playing, they were spouting," said Cahn, who on Wednesday was out looking for them again. "I've been whale watching on Monterey Bay, and this was far more exciting." Scientists say the pair's health rebounded after they returned to the bay's soothing saltwater. Their skin, which grew pitted during their trip up the Sacramento River, was looking slick and slippery by Tuesday evening. "We're still holding our breath a little bit, but we're just so pleased," said Trevor Spradlin, a marine mammal biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, the federal agency that helped lead the rescue effort. Spradlin said scientists are coming away with a treasure trove of insights and observations that will fuel months of research. "We will rigorously and systematically document this case. Really, the only other reference point was Humphrey, and that was a long time ago," he said, referring to the wayward humpback that spent nearly a month in the delta in 1985.

You can check out the video via Several comparisons of different graphics technologies have been observed this week, with stunning photo comparing real-life to Crysis, coming to our attention first. Start saving for a new PC. Of more interest to people fending off the desire to upgrade to Vista, Nzone has two videos ( ) demostrating differences between DirectX9 and DirectX10, though incrysis notes the footage is outdated. The differences are fairly pronounced, but we're sure they would be even more pronounced if it wasn't for the compressed video. One of our favourite games is receiving a new expansion pack, and have the full low-down of Civilization IV: Beyond The Sword. We can't wait. Lets hope it isn't delayed in a similar way to Halo 2 on the PC. Microsoft has revealed that the discovery of content featuring "partial nudity" was the reason the Windows Vista version of Halo 2 was delayed even longer than expected. Rumour has it, via , that according to a GameFAQs forum member, the latest issue of PSM revives the PS3 Sixaxis rumble rumors, hinting once again that Sony could integrate the "last-gen feature" into upcoming controllers. According to the magazine's rumor section, Sony will announce rumble support at E3 for a release in mid-November. The re-designed controller will allow both tilting and rumble, united at long last thanks to the settled courtroom battle between Sony and Immersion. on the 80GB Playstation 3 announced for release in Korea earlier on this week, but that didn't stop further speculation as to when or if the sizeable hard-drive would see the light of day anywhere else. Sonyâs decision to release an 80GB hard drive equipped Playstation 3 model in Korea next month may have been informed by its plans to offer video on demand (VOD) services throughout the region via PS3s. , Sony has announced its intentions to offer VOD services via Playstation 3 consoles if negotiations with a number of Korean telecoms companies proceed as expected. âWe are contacting some Korean firms in order to incorporate VOD applications into Playstation 3 service line-up,'' Sony spokeswoman Park Seo-yun said. The report states that at least two domestic landline telecom carriers, Hanaro Telecom and KT, appear to be involved in the negotiations. A Hanaro spokesman said, âWe are negotiating with Sony and the atmosphere is pretty good. We hope we will be able to reach an agreement in June.' We'd presume, that similar to Microsoft, Sony is in discussions with television providers all over the world in an attempt to line-up VOD over the Xbox 360 and PS3 respectively. Sony has said that the company could release the 80GB Playstation 3 outside South Korea - but there are currently no plans to do so. As reported by the Washington Post, spokesperson Satoshi Fukuoka said, "At this time there are no concrete plans [to sell the model in other markets]. "However," he added, "It could be an option to introduce it in other regions but it needs to be decided by each region." Similarly to reporting the 80GB HDD news, the INQ also the 1.80 firmware upgrade that was released for the PS3, but if you want to see actual pictures of the firmware in action, head on over to SCEE and BT have signed a deal that will 'transform' the Playstation Portable into a mobile communications device by incorporating wireless broadband communications functions into the handheld. The four year deal will enable users to make video calls, voice calls and send messages over the internet from home or BT wireless hotspots. The service will utilize the upcoming PSP camera and microphone and will initially be promoted across the UK.

Three pins from have been physically cut from a surface-mounted IC, which ensures the mod chips aren't able to function. Modders are expected to either get round the problem, or produce new chips that circumvent the IC. George Harrison senior vice president of marketing at Nintendo of America has said the company is targeting sales of 35 million Wiis in the US, close to the 38.2 million PS2s sold by Sony in the region. Speaking to Bloomberg, he said the ambitious target would be met by 2011 or 2012. "Demand is much greater than we anticipated," Harrison said. "A year ago no one thought we would be in this position." This should be partly fuelled by the strong line-up Nintendo announced for 2007. Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Super Mario Galaxy and DS title The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass are all on track for release this year. Metroid Prime 3: Corruption has been given a 20th August release in the US. EA hopes to revitalize the aging Sims franchise with the DS and Wii title MySims - a game that, on the surface, looks a lot like Nintendo software.

The revelation is the latest twist in the ongoing struggle between backers of the open source Linux operating system and Microsoft, the largest developer of proprietary software. For years, Microsoft has asserted that certain parts of Linux, among other open source programs, violate its patents, but it has made little effort to detail which parts, let alone stop the violations by taking vendors or users to court to obtain royalties. Last November, the company took a big step forward when it signed a with Novell to come to an agreement over intellectual property rights, the supposed IP violations, and to put customers who use both Windows and SuSE Linux at ease about possibly being sued. As part of the deal, Microsoft agreed to distribute coupons that its customers could use to purchase SuSE Linux Enterprise Server from Novell, the idea being that Microsoft would not sue these Linux customers for using software that infringes upon its patents, because it has been compensated for them through cross-licensing payments SuSE made to Microsoft. Because of this deal, other Linux vendors, notably , were put on a different level than Novell and SuSE. It also left open the possibility that Microsoft may come looking for compensation for the supposed IP violations being perpetuated by other Linux users around the globe. Microsoft has indicated that it doesn't want to resolve the situation through lawsuits, but instead would rather set up deals similar to the one with Novell to get other Linux vendors and users on the up and up with its IP--something that the Linux and open source communities have strongly objected to. (However, when Microsoft said the deal was a de facto admission by Novell that SuSE Linux violated Microsoft's IP, it really put the fork in potential deals with Red Hat and others.) While all this was going on, the backers of the GNU General Purpose License (GPL)--the licensing scheme under which Linux is distributed--have been seething at Novell's actions, and plotting to find a way to get back at Microsoft and its perceived weakening of the GPL and Linux through Novell's deal with Microsoft. The (FSF), which controls the GPL, has plotted to add elements to the new GPL v3 proposal that would put an end to the deal and force Microsoft out of the Linux business--or bend it to its open-source persuasion. What the FSF came up with was a plan that would make Microsoft subject to the GPL by emphasizing its role as a Linux distributor. Since the GPL strictly forbids patents, if Microsoft continued to distribute Linux through the SuSE coupon deal, it would legally block Microsoft from seeking compensation for supposed violations of its patents, not only from Novell SuSE customers, but from all Linux users. This is the gist behind GPL v3, and because GPL has teeth and is enforceable in a court of law, it may just work. And that's the fear that Microsoft has with GPL v3, which is expected to go into force in July, although it's still not clear if Linus Torvalds, the primary developer of Linux, will adopt GPL v3 for the ongoing distribution of the Linux kernel. Torvalds last year with GPL v3, and pledged to continue to distribute the Linux kernel under GPL v2. But in the end, it likely won't matter, because many elements of a Linux distribution will be licensed under GPL v3 anyway, giving it teeth whether the kernel is licensed under GPL v3 or not. According to its 2006 annual report Novell filed with the Security and Exchange Commission on Friday, Microsoft may call off at least part of the deal with Novell if those provisions of the GPL go into effect with v3. "If the final version of GPLv3 contains terms or conditions that interfere with our agreement with Microsoft or our ability to distribute GPLv3 code, Microsoft may cease to distribute SuSE Linux coupons in order to avoid the extension of its patent covenants to a broader range of GPLv3 software recipients," Novell stated in the document. Despite the sour treatment Novell has received from Microsoft and the pressure from the open source community, Novell is committed to the deal. Whether outside forces like the GPL v3 ultimately end it has yet to be seen.

First look: iTunes Plus Apple made good on its promise to add unprotected tracks to its online digital media store Wednesday. As expected, individual unprotected tracks are available for $1.29. Part 1 of a special five-part series. Wednesday, May 30, 2007 12:00 PM PDT A month ago, Apple and EMI announced that the record label would offer its entire catalog sans digital rights management protection at the iTunes Store sometime in May. With just a full day left in the month, Apple made good on the promise, adding these unprotected tracks--termed iTunes Plus--to its online digital media store Wednesday. As expected, individual unprotected tracks are available for US$1.29 per track while albums are offered at the same price as the protected version. Individual protected tracks continue to be priced at 99-cents per track. I've spent the better part of the morning cruising the Store's aisles to see just how iTunes Plus works. Here's what I've learned. In order to purchase iTunes Plus tracks you must upgrade to iTunes 7.2. Although an iTunes Plus link appears in the Quick Links area of earlier versions of iTunes, when you click it, you're instructed that you must upgrade to iTunes 7.2 to view iTunes Plus music. Once you've installed iTunes 7.2, that link takes you to the iTunes Plus page, which holds What's Hot and Featured Albums boxes similar to those on the Store's main page as well as Top Albums and Top Songs columns that list pretty much what their titles suggest. The page also contains a Genre pop-up menu, from which you can choose Alternative, Blues, Children's Music, Classical, Comedy, Country, Dance, Electronic, Folk, Hip-Hop/Rap, Holiday, Christian &amp; Gospel, Jazz, New Age, Opera, Pop, R&B/Soul, Reggae, Rock, Soundtrack, Spoken Word, Vocal, World, and iTunes Latino genres. Choose a genre and the contents of the What's Hot and Featured Albums boxes changes to reflect popular and featured albums within that genre. Shortly after iTunes Plus became available I looked through some of the categories and they show some growing pains. For example, much as I like Brian Eno's Thursday Afternoon and The Residents' Third Reich 'n' Roll I'm not sure they belong among the Store's featured classical albums. When you click on an album on the iTunes Plus page, you're asked if you'd like to set your iTunes Plus preference. If you click the iTunes Plus button at the bottom of the dialog box, you'll always be shown the iTunes Plus version of a music track or music video if one is available. Click Cancel and you'll continue to be offered protected tracks, though you'll be told that an album is also available in an iTunes Plus version (accompanied by a Learn More link that, once again, offers you the opportunity to enable the iTunes Plus preference). If you choose to enable that preference you can switch it off only from your iTunes Store account page where you access the option via a Manage iTunes Plus button. Regrettably, with iTunes Plus preferences enabled you're not shown the less-expensive protected version of the track. Likewise, with iTunes Plus disabled, you're not provided with links to the DRM-free tracks unless you click that Learn More link and, in the subsequent window, click the iTunes Plus button to enable the iTunes Plus preference. Among the few glitches I encountered shortly after the launch of iTunes Plus was an error dialog box that appeared whenever I attempted to change my iTunes Plus preferences. Fortunately, the error is in error. When I either enabled or disabled the preference, the new preference stuck, despite the error suggesting that there was a problem. Downloading an iTunes Plus track or album works almost exactly as does downloading protected tracks--the one thing you can't currently do is gift unprotected music as you can with the Store's protected music. A small iTunes Plus caption appears just above the Buy Album button on an album's page and a Plus icon followed by the $1.29 price sits to the left of each track's Buy Song button. Click one of these buttons and, by default, you're prompted for your ID and password, and your media downloads to your computer. The resulting files are encoded at a bit rate of 256kbps and are tagged with a .m4a extension. (This is the extension for unprotected AAC files, versus the .m4p extension appended to the Store's protected AAC files.) A four-minute track weighs in at just over 8MB. When signed into the Store, click the iTunes Plus link and you should see an Upgrade My Library area in the upper right corner of the resulting iTunes Plus windows. (I say should because, early in my testing, this disappeared from time to time.) This area was designed to make it easy to upgrade compatible contents of your iTunes Library to an unprotected form. Albums can be upgraded for 30-percent of the current album price, upgrades to individual music tracks cost 30 cents per track, and upgrading music videos costs 60 cents per video. So, for example, if you have a copy of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon in the old protected format, you can upgrade to the unprotected version for 30-percent of the current $7.99 album price. Under the Upgrade My Library heading you'll view a See Details button as well as the total number of songs and albums you can upgrade along with the price for doing so. Unfortunately, you can't upgrade individual tracks or albums--this is an all-or-nothing option for your entire compatible library. However, you're not forced to upgrade an entire album if you've purchased only a few tracks on it. In this case, you have to upgrade only those tracks you've purchased. Click the See Details button, and you're taken to a page that lists all the albums and tracks that can be upgraded. Click the Buy button and everything is upgraded to the iTunes Plus version. Before iTunes begins downloading the tracks, you're told that the old versions will be removed from your iTunes library. You have the option to direct iTunes to toss those tracks in the Trash or move them to your Desktop. In both cases, the tracks will appear in an Original iTunes Purchases folder, organized by Artist and Album folders. So, for example, within the Original iTunes Purchases folder, you'll find an Al Green folder that contains a folder for the Reverend's I Can't Stop album. With a tiny measure of luck, the upgraded versions of the tracks will download to your computer. I mention luck because, early in iTunes Plus' short life, this was a hit-or-miss affair for me. Of the 48 tracks I attempted to upgrade, 14 failed with an unknown (504) error. These were tracks from the aforementioned Al Green album and Brian Eno and J. Peter Schwalm's Drawn From Life. Subsequent attempts to download the tracks failed as well. I had no problems upgrading the Rolling Stones' Jump Back and the Berlin Philharmonic's recording of Brahms' A German Requiem. The total price of all this upgrading: $13.46. As I mentioned, non-protected tracks are encoded at 256kbps--that's twice the 128kbps bit-rate that protected songs are encoded at. Using iTunes I burned both protected and the new unprotected versions of The Stones' Jump Back and Brahms' Requiem to CD to see how they sounded through the Denon amplifier, Sony CD player, and B&W speakers in my living room. I wish I could say that the difference between the two versions was like night and day, but it wasn't. Bearing in mind that everyone's hearing is different and therefore my conclusions are purely subjective, in comparison to the protected versions, the DRM-free versions of the recordings sounded like a thin layer of film was washed away from them. In the Requiem, for example, you could more easily hear the bows' rosin and the distinct overtones of the timpani rather than their less-distinct thump in the protected version. And passages where the choir and orchestra are going at full force, the unprotected version sounds less confused--you can more easily pick out voices and instruments rather than being overwhelmed with waves of sound. Given that the Stones produce some of the dirtiest recordings in the business, I understand that using their music--some of it recorded decades ago--is an odd way to test the quality of a recording. Yet comparing the two versions of "Angie," I could more distinctly hear the tap on the cymbal's bell and closed high-hat and the 12-string guitar rings a bit more clearly. And, as with the Requiem, the various parts are a touch easier to discern. Will you hear a difference, and is that difference worth an extra 30-cents-per-track? It depends on the gear you use to listen to your music and the keenness of your hearing. Given that the earbuds bundled with the iPod are hardly audiophile quality, you're unlikely to get your money's worth listening to unprotected tracks with this kind of setup. On higher-end gear--good headphones or quality stereo speakers--you might find these tracks more to your liking. Again, the difference between protected and unprotected versions is anything but startling, but if you've stayed away from the Store in the past because you're unhappy with the quality of its tracks, you may find those offered in unprotected form more pleasing. I'll continue monitoring iTunes Plus and, with my company's gracious permission, download and scrutinize a variety of iTunes' unprotected tracks and music videos.

The spacewalkers will install Service Module Debris Protection (SMDP) panels on the Zvezda service module and reroute a Global Positioning System antenna cable during their estimated six-hour spacewalk. (Xinhua/Reuters Photo) BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhuanet) -- Protective panels designed to shield the international space station from harmful space debris were installed Wednesday by two Russian cosmonauts. Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov exited a hatch on the Russian side of the space station at 3:05 p.m. EDT. The spacewalk lasted about five and a half hours. Both men were tethered during the spacewalk to keep them from floating away. The station's third occupant, U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams, remained inside. Space debris includes objects such as discarded rocket parts, planetary dust and rocks. Scientists consider it the greatest threat to the space station, orbiting about 220 miles (350 kilometers) above Earth. The 17 protective panels, each about 2 feet by 3 feet (60 by 90 centimeters) and weighing about 20 pounds (9 kilograms), were delivered to the station last December and left outside in a formation called "the Christmas tree." The cosmonauts installed five of the panels on a Russian section of the space station, and the others were to be put in place during a spacewalk next week. The cosmonauts also successfully rerouted a cable for a navigation antenna that will be used later in the year for the first flight of a new European cargo vehicle. Wednesday's spacewalk was the first of two scheduled a week apart. Yurchikhin and Kotov will perform another one next Wednesday with similar tasks, including depositing canisters containing biological experiments outside the station.

Savner has said he doesn't think it would be enough to stimulate sales of the console significantly. "Despite growing anticipation that a $100 price cut for the PS3 is imminent this summer or early fall, we do not believe such a move would meaningfully improve stagnant PS3 sales and we are growing more concerned that a share shift away from Sony and Microsoft to Nintendo's Wii platform is incrementally negative of all third-party publishers," Savner said. He continued by describing a $50 cut "as meaningless" and added that it's down to the games to put PS3 back in the spotlight. "Based on our analysis, we conclude that a $100 price cut for the PS3 (we have dismissed a potential $50 cut as meaningless) would still leave the 'all-in' cost for a PS3 console and basic accoutrements 20-25% higher than the comparable Xbox 360, and does not even reflect the possibility that Microsoft could also lower its hardware prices. "Further, an important driver of Sony hardware last cycle was exclusive games, such as Grand Theft Auto. Unfortunately, Sony does not have a similar advantage this cycle. Halo 3, a highly anticipated game release this year is a Microsoft-published game only for the Xbox, and Grand Theft Auto IV, by Take-Two's Rockstar unit, is being released on both the Sony and Xbox platforms." Savner believes that Sony has made a number of mistakes and consumers are more price sensitive than Sony anticipated. To make up more ground, Savner says Sony would actually need a $200 price cut, but doesn't see that happening.

The reports coming out is that the American helicopter was shot down by Taliban fighters who had some new weapon technology. The Canadian soldier killed was Master Cpl. Darrell Jason Priede. He brings the Canadian death toll up to 56 since the initiative began in Afghanistan in 2002. While troops headed to the crash site of the helicopter they were also ambushed by insurgents. An air strike helped eliminate the threat, but damage was done. Priede was a combat cameraman who was working around the Kajaki dam. The dam is being repaired to supply electricity to Kandahar. &#8220;In working to bring peace to this troubled country, he has ended up paying the ultimate sacrifice,&#8221; said Brig.-Gen. Tim Grant, head of Canada&#8217;s Afghanistan task force. &#8220;There is no way to comfort those who grieve at this terrible time. However, we should all remember that Darrell was involved in a good thing, a good fight and we should be proud of what he has done.&#8221; It is always sad news to hear the death of a Canadian soldier or any solder for that matter as conditions are still very unfavorable in the region.

Sure, that&#8217;s George Lucas up there on stage, but isn&#8217;t that Martha Stewart? And there&#8217;s Steve Ballmer of Microsoft, but the crowd listening to him includes former RIAA executive Hilary Rosen and &#8220;Men in Black&#8221; director Barry Sonnenfeld. When George Lucas came on stage Wednesday evening, there was polite applause. Likewise for other speakers such as Senator John McCain, Cisco CEO John Chambers, and CBS President Leslie Moonves. Even Steve Jobs&#8217; early-afternoon session was not preceded by the kind of anticipation that one sees outside a Macworld Expo keynote address. joint evening appearance of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates ? The feeling was electric, even for this high-tech, high-powered crowd. Even 15 minutes before showtime, the sheer anticipation in the audience was more like the vibe you&#8217;d get from a rock concert than from a sedate sit-down with two writers and two technology billionaires. And the pair of billionaires did not disappoint. Well, to be fair, they probably disappointed anyone who expected this to be the sort of event where two men enter and one man leaves. This was not a no-holds-barred battle of wits. Instead, it was a fascinating opportunity to view two men who are very much in the public eye, perhaps destined to be inextricably linked to one another in the history books, interact with each other for the first time in a public setting in a decade. What struck me most about Jobs&#8217;s and Gates&#8217;s interaction with one another was the genuine warmth they both felt when nostalgically recalling the early days of the personal computer revolution, when Microsoft supplied a version of the BASIC programming language for the Apple II and then became one of the flagship application developers for the very first Mac. In an industry that has trouble remembering what happened last week, these men have 30 years of history &#8212; much of it good, believe it or not. As Jobs eloquently put it: &#8220;When Bill and I first met each other and worked together in the early days, generally we were both the youngest guys in the room. And now, when we&#8217;re working at our companies, I don&#8217;t know about [Bill], but I&#8217;m the oldest guy in the room sometimes&#8230; there&#8217;s that one line in that one Beatles, &#8216;You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead.&#8217; And that clearly is true here.&#8221; It&#8217;s easy to portray these two as bitter rivals, and their two companies certainly provide contrasting styles and approaches to technology that match the personalities of their founders. Jobs showed himself to be a very thoughtful, almost philosophical speaker at times. Likewise true to form, Gates exposed his unabashed geeky love of the nuts and bolts of the engineering behind the technology. But both seemed to recognize the strengths of the other. For me, the most telling statement of the night was from Gates, when each man was asked about what he admired about the other. &#8220;I&#8217;d give a lot to have Steve&#8217;s taste, his intuitive taste, both for people and products,&#8221; said Gates. He told a story about one of those early meetings when the original Mac was being developed, in which Gates would approach problems from a technical perspective, as &#8220;an engineering guy.&#8221; And in contrast, he&#8217;d see Steve Jobs make an intuitive decision, based on &#8220;his sense of people&#8221; and how they&#8217;d respond to using the technology. &#8220;And it was magical,&#8221; Gates recalled. &#8220;Wow!&#8221; Jobs, hearkening back to Apple&#8217;s decision not to license the Mac OS to other hardware companies, which led to the rise of Microsoft Windows, said that he regretted that Apple had too much of a lone-wolf mentality in those days. &#8220;Because Woz and I started the company based on doing the whole banana, we weren&#8217;t so good at partnering with people&#8230;. And if Apple had more of that in its DNA, it would&#8217;ve served us really well. And [Apple] didn&#8217;t learn that until a couple decades later.&#8221; This is not to say that the night was entirely a love-fest, not on where Jobs likened the Windows version of iTunes to &#8220;giving a glass of icewater to somebody in hell.&#8221; (Video highlights of Jobs&#8217;s solo appearance is embedded below, courtesy of the D conference. Warning: the video will probably be preceded by an ad. This is one of the many reasons why Rupert Murdoch wants to pay a big pile of money for the Wall Street Journal.) Most notably the pair clashed about, of all things, Apple&#8217;s successful series of television ads featuring the Mac Guy (Justin Long) and the PC Guy (John Hodgman). Gates was visibly uncomfortable during the entire discussion of the ads, not buying Jobs&#8217;s suggestion that &#8220;The art of those commercials is not to be mean, but is actually for the guys to like each other.&#8221; When both Jobs and co-moderator Kara Swisher expressed that they liked the PC guy, Gates shot back, &#8220;His mother loves him.&#8221; And when Jobs carted out his well-worn Alan Kay quote about people who make software desiring to design their own hardware, Gates let rip with another dry rejoinder: &#8220;I can resist that.&#8221; But Gates did admit that, in certain areas, Apple&#8217;s approach to unified hardware and software design was appropriate, which is why Microsoft has adopted it for products such as the Zune, Xbox, and the new However, the pair did find a lot of common ground, especially when defending the honor of the technology product that defines both of them: the personal computer. While excitedly discussing the future of tiny, &#8220;post-PC&#8221; devices, Jobs and Gates both said that the death of the PC is probably a long way off. Gates ticked off other devices that were going to kill the PC, like the network computer, and the single-function computer. Jobs said that &#8220;the PC will continue to be with us, and it&#8217;ll morph with us.&#8221; But Jobs also showed a greater enthusiasm for the possibilities in those new devices, such as the iPod and the iPhone. They also both defended the evolution of the computer operating system, after co-moderator Walt Mossberg suggested that innovation in the computer interface has largely stalled since the introduction of the Mac in 1984. Jobs suggested that if you disappeared for 10 years and then returned, you&#8217;d notice the incremental improvements that have been happening on our desktops. Gates, completely in character, expressed enthusiasm for new technologies such as speech recognition and computer vision. But he also expressed excitement for the concept of a 3-D interface design where, for example, an online bookstore could have &#8212; wait for it &#8212; a 3-D representation of real books! Amazon take note &#8212; or don&#8217;t. As both men pointed out, one of the challenges of being the vendor of a computer operating system and software programs is that you&#8217;ve got a base of users who won&#8217;t accept radical change. As Jobs put it, even if it&#8217;s better to drive a car with six wheels and steer it via a joystick, people won&#8217;t accept those changes. They like four-wheeled cars you drive with a steering wheel. So the changes in our desktops (3-D bookshelves aside) will be more incremental, while standalone devices like the iPhone and Microsoft Surface will have more radical concepts. Ultimately, did this Gates-Jobs joint appearance live up to the electricity in the room beforehand? Even though it was a relatively gentle kind of evening, I&#8217;d have to say yes. To see these two icons of the computer industry, reacting to one another and playing off each other, in an informal setting free of PR handlers, was a chance to peek through their shells a little bit. And what we got was a good glimpse at two men who genuinely love technology and are driven by their enthusiasm in the work they have chosen. As Jobs himself said, &#8220;I sort of look at us as two of the luckiest guys on the planet.&#8221; (More coverage, including a forthcoming video and full transcript, will be available on the 17 Comments on this story Email this story to a friend Enter your trial subscription and Macworld will rush you a FREE TRIAL ISSUE.

DRM-Free Music Now Available on iTunes May 30, 2007 10:00AM With the release of iTunes Plus, customers can download DRM-free tracks from EMI artists without limitations on the type of music player or number of computers on which the purchased songs can be played; the iTunes Plus songs will play on all iPods, Macs, Windows PCs, as well as many other digital music players. Feds Arrest 'Spam King' in Seattle IRS Spoof Targets Execs Through RTF CDW Accepts $7.3 Billion To Go Private Palm Foleo: A 'Smartphone Companion' Samsung Debuts 4-GB Mobile Chipset On Wednesday, Apple launched two new elements within its iTunes Music Store: iTunes Plus and iTunes U. Analysts described the new features as an evolutionary move designed to broaden the iTunes user base. The new iTunes Plus offers DRM-free music tracks encoded in AAC at 256 Kbps for $1.29 per song. Plus launches with EMI's digital catalog, including singles and albums from Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, Norah Jones, Frank Sinatra, Joss Stone, Pink Floyd, John Coltrane, and more than a dozen of Paul McCartney's classic albums. "Our customers are very excited about the freedom and amazing sound quality of iTunes Plus," Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO, said in a statement. "We expect more than half of the songs on iTunes will be offered in iTunes Plus versions by the end of this year." With the release of iTunes Plus, customers can download tracks from EMI artists without limitations on the type of music player or number of computers on which the purchased songs can be played. The iTunes Plus songs will play on all iPods, Macs, Windows PCs, as well as many other digital music players. The iTunes store will continue to offer its entire catalog, currently over five million songs, in the same versions as today -- 128 Kbps AAC with DRM -- at 99 cents per song, alongside the higher quality iTunes Plus versions, when available. Customers can upgrade their library of previously purchased EMI content to iTunes Plus tracks for 30 cents a song, or $3.00 for most albums. EMI called the launch of the DRM-free iTunes content a significant milestone, and NPD Group analyst Russ Crupnick agreed. He predicted DRM in the digital world might eventually cease altogether for two reasons: higher price points are favorable to the industry and DRM-free content could open up new sales avenues. "DRM-free music is a way of getting more people into the practice of buying digital music. The hope is that other music stores could offer content that would get more people into the whole digital music arena," Crupnick said. "To me, that's the next important step. We've got a lot of early adopters coming in. But how do you start to mainstream digital music? This might help." Apple didn't stop there. The company also announced the launch of iTunes U, a dedicated area within the iTunes store featuring free content such as course lectures, language lessons, lab demonstrations, sports highlights, and campus tours provided by top U.S. colleges and universities including Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Duke University, and MIT. "iTunes U makes it easy for anyone to access amazing educational material from many of the country's most respected colleges and universities," Eddy Cue, Apple's vice president of iTunes, said in a statement. "Education is a lifelong pursuit and we're pleased to give everyone the ability to download lectures, speeches, and other academic content for free." with colleges and universities, iTunes U aims to make it easier to extend learning, explore interests, learn more about a school, and stay connected with an alma mater. The move demonstrates Apple's intent to make iTunes more of a community, according to Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering Group. "Apple has traditionally played a strong role in the public school system and now iTunes U goes up the ladder a little bit by offering a music interface that gives people access to content that's not always easy to get," Doherty noted. "We're entering into a phase of our economy where education is becoming more important, so this is a wonderful move for people." Increase visitor confidence on your site with the green address bar.

In fact it goes further than others and warns that even "moderate additional" greenhouse emissions are likely to push Earth past "critical tipping points" with "dangerous consequences for the planet." The study conducted by NASA and the Columbia University Earth Institute appears in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. Its lead author is James Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. The forecast effects include "increasingly rapid sea-level rise, increased frequency of droughts and floods, and increased stress on wildlife and plants due to rapidly shifting climate zones," according to the NASA announcement. By heralding the new research paper, NASA is endorsing science that places considerably more urgency on the need to reduce emissions to avoid "disastrous effects" of global warming than was evident in the recent reports from the world's scientists coordinated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. As the tipping points pass, "there is an acceleration, potentially uncontrollable, of emissions of vast natural stores of greenhouse gas," according to Hansen, who reviewed the study for ABC News. Hansen explains that dangerous feedback loops are being tracked in various regions of the planet. Many studies have reported feedback loops already observed in thawing tundra, sea beds and drying forests. Hansen also points out that dark and therefore heat-absorbing forests are now expanding toward the Arctic, replacing lighter-colored areas such as tundra and snow cover.

Cosmonauts Install Protective Space Station Panels posted: 30 May 2007 The International Space Station (ISS) is a little better protected against impact by stray particles today after two Russian cosmonauts installed debris shielding to the station during a 5 hour, 25 minute spacewalk. and flight engineer Oleg installed five Service Module Debris Protection (SMDP) panels to the service module of the orbital laboratory and also rerouted a Global Positioning System antenna cable. The spacewalk was a first for both cosmonauts. &#8220;Look at that sunset,&#8221; said one of the spacewalkers while outside the ISS. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing.&#8221; &#8220;Oh yes, I&#8217;ve already had a look,&#8221; the other one replied. Williams remained inside the space station and provided support for the spacewalkers. The number one risk Module functions as a living quarters for the ISS and is also responsible for some life support system functions for the station. It was launched in 2000 without adequate shielding against impacts by micrometeorites and orbital debris, with the intention of adding additional protection during future spacewalks. The SMDP panels are designed to protect the ISS from small- and medium-sized micro meteoroid orbital debris (MMOD) that could strike the space station and cause a potentially catastrophic hull rupture. &#8220;This is one of area we share with our shuttle brothers,&#8221; said ISS Deputy Manager Kirk before the spacewalk. &#8220;The number one risk for the shuttle is MMOD impact when it&#8217;s on orbit. It&#8217;s also that way for the ISS.&#8221; Each aluminum panel measures about two feet by three feet, is about one inch thick and weighs 15 to 20 pounds. The spacewalk kicked off at 3:05 p.m. EDT (1905 GMT), after a 45 minute delay caused by a communication problem between ground controllers and the space station encountered during preparations.

The market has already decided how much a gaming system is worth. The answer? Probably not much more than $250. Let's look at current generation console prices to date, in U.S. dollars. Nintendo's Wii rings up at about $250. Microsoft's Xbox 360's three flavors include the $300 Core pack, the $400 Premium edition, and the $480 Elite. Sony's PlayStation 3 is available in $500 and $600 options. All other things being equal, the Wii's price is obviously the most attractive, which might explain why it's outselling the 360 by about 2-to-1, and the PS3 by about 4-to-1. But all other things are not equal, of course. Not even close. Any gamer with even passing familiarity with all three systems could expound on their individual hardware strengths and weaknesses. And serious enthusiasts debate at length about the relative values of each console, and to what degree the inclusion of such features as out-of-the-box wireless should be taken into account. The prices of optional and less-optional accessories also figure into the discussion, as do the online services offered. And then there are the games. The quality and marketability of a system's game library, especially its exclusive titles, is a decisive factor in any console's success. Here again, there's plenty of room for speculation about what the future holds for each system. And not surprisingly, gamers are highly attuned to each console's ability to deliver the types of games they crave. For the dedicated gamer, there's a lot to argue, wonder and worry about. For everyone else, though, the issue boils down to one primary concern: price. It would be foolish to overlook brand strengths, marketing strategies and the like in any analysis of why the Wii is selling more units than both of its higher-end colleagues combined. I'm not suggesting that a novel control scheme and Nintendo's family-friendly image aren't helping move Wiis. And the PS3's current lack of high-profile releases is obviously hurting Sony. But these and similar factors are secondary concerns for the wider market. The bottom line is the average consumer is only going to pay so much for a gaming console, regardless of what it offers. Microsoft's and Sony's entries are simply above the price point at which the lion's share of consumers decide a gaming experience is worthwhile. Most people, regardless of their age, tax bracket or nationality, enjoy playing games from time to time, electronic or otherwise. Yet for most of the world, for which games are passing diversions, the prospect of paying hundreds of dollars for an electronic game system seems downright silly. Most gamers who venture forth into the non-gaming world are painfully aware of the fact that average consumers don't view videogames in form as worthy of copious amounts of time, money and attention. It isn't critical to them that the PS3 includes a Blu-Ray player, or the 360's Live service provides a cross-title online community, or that either features high-definition output. They're not overly concerned about the particular handful of exclusives for each console. And they're not nearly as discerning in terms of game design or quality. I'm convinced that both gamers and much of the gaming industry often vastly overestimate the considerations of the average consumer. Round up the electronic gaming experiences that have found wide audiences outside the core gamer demographic, and you'll notice a conspicuous absence of epic, immersive and original high-budget games. Instead, you'll find a steady stream of successful casual entries from PopCap and company. You'll see Nintendo's Touch! Generations titles and an accompanying army of charming, lightweight imitators. And you'll discover a deluge of half-baked cursory tie-ins to movie, television and other pop-culture IPs. The vision espoused by Sony and Microsoft, of an elite gaming lifestyle enabled by high-end, expensive tech, just doesn't appeal to the rest of the world. So it's not a matter of how much their consoles are worth. It's a matter of the degree to which modern society values electronic entertainment. If Nintendo's successes with the Wii thus far are any indication, $250 is near the upper end of what consumers are willing to pay for such experiences. So where does that leave those of us clamoring for the next , or the next-gen successors to Final Fantasy XII, Psychonauts Shadow of the Colossus ? Where does that leave the dyed-in-the wool enthusiast, accustomed to high-definition spectacle? In my less optimistic moments I'm tempted to entertain the suspicions of the populace at large, and wonder whether the near-obsessive attention we often give to games is warranted. Maybe an epic, 100-hour RPG isn't really a valuable use of my time. Does it really matter whether or not my game characters' faces show every pore or whether they perfectly lip-sych their lines? Is my hand-wringing over weapon balancing in the latest multiplayer shooter justified? And can I truly not live without destructible landscapes and motion blur? But in the end I must confess these things often matter to me. There's no denying my own unbridled enthusiasm for the high-end aspects of this medium. I take comfort in the fact I'm not alone, and that even though the high cost of the PS3 seems thus far to be a major Sony misstep, it's still selling units. And with luck it will continue to sell. Because as wrongheaded as Sony and Microsoft often appear to be in their pricing and marketing strategies, I want that slice of their vision, the one that caters to gamers such as myself, to take hold of the world at large. I want a world populated by gamers that recognize not just the value of casual, accessible diversions, but the value of visually rich, artfully designed and emotionally compelling experiences. Earlier this year Xbox platform manager John Rodman made one of those fabulously arrogant remarks we've become so accustomed to hearing from Sony and Microsoft execs. "We don't feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing," he told the . "We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else." As snide as Rodman's remark sounds, there's a grain of truth in what he says. And maybe even a ray of hope. It's not hard to imagine that the widespread successes of the Wii and DS will foster a greater appreciation of electronic games in general. And one has to imagine that at some point loyal DS and Wii converts might yearn for more in terms of graphical fidelity, gameplay depth, or online interaction. Right now, there's no disputing that Nintendo's winning the battle for consumers' hearts, minds and, most importantly, dollars. Will the trend continue, and will it result in an increasingly risk-averse industry, disinclined toward the production of the higher-end titles dedicated gamers seek? Will the lowest common denominator casual and licensed game offerings eventually become the face of the gaming industry? Or will consumers eventually hear the siren song of the higher-priced, higher-end consoles, amplified by growing game libraries and possible console price reductions? Time will tell, but I'm willing to bet that in the years to come, Nintendo will he heralded as having been gaming's chief evangelist, and the successes of casual and B-list games as whole will have established the foundation for an entirely new demographic of gamers. One that might even be willing to pay a lot more than $250 for a gaming console. IGG Announces Gods War Online Warhammer Online Beta Sign-Ups Open!

The arrest follows an indictment by a federal grand jury in Seattle last week. and his company, Newport Internet Marketing Corp., with fraudulently selling broadcast e-mail products and services that amounted to spam. The U.S. attorney's office for the Western District of Washington referred to Soloway as a "spam king" for the volume of unsolicited commercial e-mail his company produced. He is charged with mail fraud, identity theft, fraud and money laundering, Soloway advertised a mass e-mail service that sent messages to an opt-in list of addresses but didn't actually use such a permission-based list, the indictment said. He also sold software products that customers could use themselves to send out mass e-mails. However, the product often didn't work, and if it did, it sent e-mails using forged headers. He also failed to offer promised support services, according to the court documents. In addition, when customers complained, Soloway threatened additional fees and referral to a collection agency. Soloway is also accused of sending out tens of millions of e-mails, often using forged e-mail addresses and domains in the "from" line, advertising his services. As a result, some people who legitimately owned the e-mail address or domain were blamed for the spam and were blacklisted by Internet service providers. The indictment also said that Soloway used programs and many different proxy computers in an effort to hide the source of the messages. Soloway conducted the spamming activities at least from late 2003 through early this year, according to the indictment. If convicted, Soloway faces fines of over $772,000, which is the amount he illegally obtained from his activities, as well as forfeiture of other money and property.

With the new "Street View" feature in Google Maps, street level imagery is available for maps of the San Francisco area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver and Miami, and will soon expand to other metropolitan regions, Google said in a statement. Users looking at Google Maps through a Web browser can navigate around a city, "virtually" walking the streets, checking out restaurants and landmarks and even zoom in on bus stops or street signs to make travel plans. Google is playing catch-up with street-level viewing features, following in the footsteps of A9.com's BlockView mapping feature introduced in early 2005 and showing street-level views in roughly two dozen major U.S. cities. A9.com, a unit of Amazon.com Inc., discontinued the feature in September 2006. A9 Chief Executive Udi Manber subsequently joined Google as vice president of engineering. Microsoft Corp. has offered what it calls a "birds-eye" view on parts of its MSN Virtual Earth three-dimensional mapping service for several big U.S. cites since late in 2005. Google also announced plans for "Mapplets", a tool for independent software developers to build mini-applications that be displayed within Google Maps. Mapplets can display a variety of information, from housing listings to crime data as well as ways to measure distances between different points on the map. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo Inc. and MapQuest, a unit of Time Warner Inc.'s AOL online business, all continue to compete aggressively to create new online mapping features, said analyst Greg Sterling of Sterling Market Intelligence. &copy; Reuters 2007.

According to analyst Greg Sterling, the steady introduction of new mapping features is driven to a large extent by competition rather than by an expectation of revenue. Feds Arrest 'Spam King' in Seattle IRS Spoof Targets Execs Through RTF CDW Accepts $7.3 Billion To Go Private Palm Foleo: A 'Smartphone Companion' Samsung Debuts 4-GB Mobile Chipset According to the great British satirist Douglas Adams, the stages of a civilization can be summarized in three questions: 1. How can we eat? (Survival); 2. Why do we eat? (Inquiry); and 3. Where shall we have lunch? (Sophistication). It's the last of those questions -- the search for a good place to eat -- that is driving the most recent Web battle: the push to make online mapping services increasingly sophisticated and user-friendly. Both Google, which operates Google Maps, and , which runs Live Search Maps, announced new features on Tuesday that are designed to help users plan trips, get previews of where they are going, and, most importantly, find businesses that might be persuaded to advertise with the mapping services. Two weeks ago, Google signaled the intensity of its work in this area by launching the Google Lat Long Blog, devoted specifically to the company's work on its maps, Google Earth, its local map service, and related APIs. "Things are changing so fast," said John Hanke, the Director of Google Earth and Maps, in the blog's initial post, "we thought a blog focused on this topic would be the best way to communicate with you, both about our products and about the overall development of geo on the Web." At the Where 2.0 conference on Tuesday, Hanke rolled out two new Google developments: "Street View" and "Mapplets." The Street View feature offers map users 360 degree images of streets in various urban areas around the country. Initially, images are available for portions of the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver, and Miami, with other areas to be added later. If street level views are available for a particular area, a new button labeled "Street View" will appear on the Google map. Users can click on the image, pan in every direction, and even move forward or back, creating the illusion of walking down the street. The other feature introduced by Google, Mapplets, is designed to help developers and consumers create mini-applications that can be embedded on Google Maps to provide information or perform simple tasks. Three sample applications demonstrated by Google included real estate listings, movie times, and a distance-measurement tool. In its press release, Google said that several of its partners, including WeatherBug and Booking.com, have already created customized Mapplets. "Maps are an enormously popular application," said Greg Sterling, an Internet search analyst and founder of Sterling Market Intelligence. "They've proven to draw millions of users. In fact, Google Maps may be its most successful product, apart from search. These new features are designed to reinforce that usage."

Hate Novell because its business stinks. ) tried to clear the air last week, big time. The Waltham, Mass., software company wrapped up a review of its options accounting practices that began late last year, and announced that it won't need to restate a decade's worth of financial results. The company also provided details on a controversial pact with Microsoft )--in a nutshell, Novell hasn't agreed to sell the scaly hides of 100 open-source developers to Bill Gates in exchange for a boxcar full of gold bars. Now it's back to business as usual. Unfortunately for Novell, business isn't good. Analysts expect the company's second-quarter earnings will come in around $4.7 million on Wednesday--that's a drop of of 50%. Worse yet, sales are set to slide to $235.1 million from $278.3 million. As a result, over the past year Novell's shares have plodded along, dropping from $7.82 to $7.55. The problem? For the past 10 years, booming sales of cheap software from Microsoft and open-source software vendors have sapped sales of Novell's venerable NetWare offering. Novell tried to adapt, first by repositioning itself as a vendor of open-source software with a string of acquisitions in 2003. Then it ticked off many of its newfound friends by announcing a deal with open-source foe Microsoft last November. One of Novell's open-source developers even resigned over the arrangement. Since then, there has been widespread speculation about the deal's terms. Novell offered up many of the details when it released its annual report last week after wrapping up its accounting review. It's now clear that Novell didn't agree that Linux violates any of Microsoft's patents--a key issue for the Linux faithful. True believers aren't satisfied with the arrangement--which has Microsoft selling support from Novell for open-source software--but some concede it could have been worse. The real bad news, of course, is that Novell also made its earlier preliminary results for the first quarter official: It confirmed that it lost $19.9 million on $229.6 million in sales. The upside? Novell has more than $1.8 billion worth of cash and short-term investments. And with its accounting review wrapped up, the company can now spread a little of that money around. The company could start buying back shares or it may even reward open-source developers with a few acquisitions, analysts say. Spreading a little of its money around in the open-source community may not make it any more popular, but at least it won't be the only software company accused of selling out.

Fatdoor wants you to meet your neighbors online. Raj Abhyanker knocked on more than 3,000 doors during his 2005 bid to become a city council member in the Silicon Valley suburb of . His efforts didnât land him a seat on the council, but they did plant the seed for his newest venture. Struck by how little people seemed to know others in their neighborhood, Mr. Abhayanker soon started work on Fatdoor, a social networking service that is designed to help neighbors get to know each other. âPeople spend more time on their computer now than they do talking to their neighbors face to face,â said Mr. Abhyanker, a patent attorney whose startup launched Monday night. Co-founded by Mr. Abhyanker and Chandu Thota, the lead developer of Microsoftâs Virtual Earth mapping software, Fatdoor users can map out their addresses on top of Microsoft maps and network with the people who live nearby. Fatdoor tools allow users to send messages to their neighbors, and form hyper-local groups around certain topics. âThereâs no easy or efficient way to reach out to the neighborhood with one button, to let them know that you lost a pet or youâre having work done on your house,â said Mr. Thota. With $1 million in funding from former PayPal CEO Bill Harris and Bertram Capital managing director Jeff Drazan, Fatdoor has tapped into growing investor interest in location specific sites designed to attract local residents and advertisers. But Fatdoor is moving into an increasingly crowded market that includes zip-code-based social networking and news delivery sites such as Outside.in and Backfence. Yahoo Groups and Meetup, meanwhile, let neighbors form groups. âIf you can aggregate traffic for small local businesses, everybody is trying to tap into that,â said media analyst Greg Sterling. A key challenge for these sites is to get enough users in a given location to contribute content so the sites do not appear empty. Fatdoor, for example, is seeding its site with Yellow Pages content. The company is also trying to forge relationships with local clubs in the hopes theyâll encourage members to sign up for the service, which started its test run in Ironically, Mr. Thota hopes to drive awareness of his new site the old fashioned wayâby word of mouth. âOnce you satisfy a couple of users in the neighborhood, theyâll start evangelizing the product to neighbors,â said Mr. Thota. âItâs very event driven. When people have a block party we see more signups from that street that night.â Outside.in highlights the hyper-local. Touchscreen technology allows for group computing.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/14-1&fd=R&url=http://www.ndtvprofit.com/homepage/news.asp%3Fid%3D300758&cid=1116797290&ei=muxeRqqvDIX20AHe4M3QDQ Novell won't be punished for Microsoft deal - source BOSTON (Reuters) - A foundation that owns rights to much of the code behind Linux software has decided not to carry out threats to punish Novell Inc. over a deal with Microsoft Corp, a person familiar with the matter said. The nonprofit Free Software Foundation had threatened to take punitive action against Novell for entering into a patent agreement with Microsoft, whose Windows operating system is a rival to Linux and is seen as a foe by the open source community. Some saw the deal as endorsing Microsoft's claims that it holds patents to intellectual property behind some open source software. The foundation was reviewing whether to block Novell from getting access to the foundation-controlled components of Linux that will be distributed under the terms of a new licensing agreement that is being finalized. One of the pioneering forces behind the open source software movement, the foundation has decided not to include any language in the final draft of the agreement that will punish Novell, according to the person familiar with the foundation's deliberations. "This is good news for Novell," said Katherine Egbert, an analyst with Jefferies & Co." The foundation controls rights to a group of programs known as the GNU operating system, an important part of Linux. The group does not control the software's namesake, the Linux kernel, which is owned by another nonprofit, the Linux Foundation. Free Software Foundation Executive Director Peter Brown would not discuss the foundation's decision, but confirmed that it had finalized its proceedings. Novell and its main rival Red Hat Inc. sell standardized versions of Linux with custom features, maintenance plans and technical support. The two companies also sell other types of open source software, including OpenOffice, which competes with Microsoft Word; Excel and PowerPoint programs; and XenSource, a rival to EMC Corp.'s VMware software that boosts the efficiency of server computers. Sales of Novell's SUSE Linux products accounted for 5 percent of the $967 million in revenue that the company reported last year. The deal with Microsoft has turned into a far bigger cash generator, bringing in two upfront payments totaling $348 million. The two companies agreed to sell their products jointly, develop technologies that make it easier for businesses to use Linux alongside Windows software, and not sue each other's customers for any patent violations when using their software. Some members of the open source community said that deal would undermine the patent security of Linux software and give Microsoft an edge in persuading businesses to use Microsoft products over Linux and other types of open source software. The foundation is scheduled to disclose its decision on the Novell matter by June 4 on its Web site, www.fsf.org, when it will post the final draft of the new license, which is known as the General Public License version 3, or GPLv3. Novell Chief Financial Officer Dana Russell declined comment on the matter.

Man described as 1 of world's top 10 spammers arrested in US 1:21PM A man described as one of the world's most prolific spammers was arrested, and U.S. authorities said computer users across the Web could notice a decrease in the amount of junk e-mail. Robert Alan Soloway, 27, is accused of using networks of compromised "zombie" computers to send out millions of spam e-mails. "He's one of the top 10 spammers in the world," said Tim Cranton, a Microsoft Corp. lawyer who is senior director of the company's Worldwide Internet Safety Programs. "He's a huge problem for our customers. This is a very good day." A federal grand jury last week returned a 35-count indictment against Soloway charging him with mail fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering. Soloway pleaded not guilty Wednesday afternoon to all charges after a judge determined that _ even with four bank accounts seized by the government _ he was sufficiently well off to pay for his own lawyer. Soloway has been living in a ritzy apartment and drives an expensive Mercedes convertible, said prosecutor Kathryn Warma. Prosecutors are seeking to have him forfeit $773,000 (euro576,005) they say he made from his business, Newport Internet Marketing Corp. A public defender who represented him for Wednesday's hearing declined to comment. Prosecutors say Soloway used computers infected with malicious code to send out millions of junk e-mails since 2003. The computers are called "zombies" because owners typically have no idea their machines have been infected. He continued his activities even after Microsoft won a $7 million civil judgment against him in 2005 and the operator of a small Internet service provider in Oklahoma won a $10 million judgment, prosecutors said. U.S. Attorney Jeff Sullivan said this case is the first in the country in which federal prosecutors have used identity theft statutes to prosecute a spammer for taking over someone else's Internet domain name. Soloway could face decades in prison, though prosecutors said they have not calculated what guideline sentencing range he might face. Soloway used the networks of compromised computers to send out unsolicited bulk e-mails urging people to use his Internet marketing company to advertise their products, authorities said. People who clicked on a link in the e-mail were directed to his website. There, Soloway advertised his ability to send out as many as 20 million e-mail advertisements over 15 days for $495 (euro368), the indictment said. Soloway remained in federal detention pending a hearing Monday. This story is sourced direct from an overseas news agency as an additional service to readers.

Fatdoor: Social Networking for Real Communities Fatdoor social network mirrors the real world to let users connect with neighbors and local businesses. Part 1 of a special five-part series. Thursday, AM PDT Fatdoor.com, a Web site that mirrors the real world to let users to connect with their neighbors, launched Tuesday with a new spin on social networking. Instead of anonymous interaction, Fatdoor lets users communicate directly with local neighbors and businesses, said Raj Abhyanker, CEO and co-founder of the company. Abhyanker launched the company with Chandu Thota, who was the lead developer for Microsoft Corp.'s Virtual Earth mapping and location tool. Bill Harris, the former CEO of PayPal Inc. and Intuit Inc., is an investor and chairman of the company. "We're trying to build something on the Internet that mirrors the real world," Harris said. "We call it a local community network. It is a social network that is based around the place you live and the ... people you know. It is not an anonymous activity; this is a social network for adults." Abhyanker said he came up with the idea while running for the city council of Cupertino, Calif., in 2005. After knocking on 3,000 doors as part of his canvassing, he noticed that most people didn't know their neighbors. He said he began thinking about how to use the Web to "enhance neighborhoods, to give the power to the few who are very active to use for the common benefit of all neighbors." The first release of Fatdoor is open to residents of Silicon Valley, with later releases expanding the site cities and towns throughout the U.S. The site was built using Virtual Earth maps, showing specific house and businesses as icons. The icons can be "claimed" by users to hold their online profiles, which can be viewed by others in the neighborhood looking for specific services, to start a club or for other purposes, Abhyanker said. As users add content, their neighbors can learn about local events or business deals, he added. The goal is to foster a group of active users in the neighborhood who can self-regulate content using the Wikipedia model. Eventually, Abhyanker said, Fatdoor could be used by community activists or civic groups for various projects, such as producing a neighborhood newspaper, he added. Harris said the business model for Fatdoor calls for the site to eventually be supported by national and local advertisers eager to target users in specific locations. The site will first list all businesses in the local Yellow Pages and then allow each of those companies to personalize the listings, he said. Users can then add reviews and comments about the businesses. For more enterprise computing news, visit . Story copyright &copy; 2007 Computerworld Inc.

Panoramio has worked hand in hand with Google for a long time, but, on Wednesday evening, the relationship became more of a hand within hand sort of thing as Google acquired the company. Panoramio &ldquo;is a website that enables digital photographers to geolocate, store and organize their photographs - and to view those photographs in Google Earth and Google Maps,&rdquo; as explained by a statement from Google. The acquisition won&rsquo;t change any of that; Panoramio will continue to be a default layer in Yet, presumably because of the privacy concerns that pop up whenever Google is involved, users are being provided with the opportunity to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of the acquisition. Users who don&rsquo;t choose this option - or who do nothing at all - will, at the close of the deal, have their Panoramio-related data and photos transferred to the search engine giant. The acquisition will, however, &ldquo;bring many advantages to Panoramio users, starting with a better infrastructure to improve the reliability of Panoramio, more frequent updates of Panoramio&rsquo;s Google Earth layer, and more resources for some invisible tasks that take time out from working on new features,&rdquo; according to &ldquo;Jos&eacute;, Joaqu&iacute;n and Eduardo&rdquo; - Panoramio&rsquo;s three . (Joaqu&iacute;n and Eduardo are actually co-founders.) One last note - even as the $75 million deal between eBay and StumbleUpon is confirmed, we&rsquo;ve been left in the dark about the financial details of the Google-Panoramio acquisition. The terms were not disclosed, but, according to , the company was &ldquo;very (and we mean very) happy&rdquo; about the takeover. Doug is a staff writer for for the latest eBusiness news.

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ffile%3D/c/a/2007/05/31/MNGKJQ45391.DTL&cid In the Creation Museum, it's all by the Book / High-tech displays seek to make a case against evolution High-tech displays seek to make a case against evolution" /> In the Creation Museum, it's all by the Book High-tech displays seek to make a case against evolution Richard Fausset, Los Angeles Times Thursday, 04:00 PDT Petersburg, Ky. -- The glass display case filled with a variety of finches could be in any natural history museum. It is set among exhibits on frogs and lizards, across from a gift shop and a diorama of life in ancient times. But this is something different: the Creation Museum, a $27 million destination that brings a new level of high-tech polish to anti-evolution argument. The text below the display case says scientists are "puzzled" by the varieties of finches. "The Bible provides the explanation," the text continues. "In the beginning of time, six thousand years ago, God created every kind of bird, including the finch kind, and He gave them the ability to 'multiply on the Earth.' " The 60,000-square-foot museum, which opened this week on 49 acres of lush Kentucky countryside, is the work of Answers in Genesis, a leader in the "young Earth" creationist movement. Unlike proponents of intelligent design -- who question aspects of evolutionary theory but may accept that the universe is billions of years old -- members of "young Earth" groups insist that the Book of Genesis is an accurate historical record. Because history began only 6,000 years ago, they argue, dinosaurs discovered in the fossil record must have coexisted with humans. In the diorama that greets museum visitors, models of baby T. rexes cavort among animatronic children clad in buckskin. Dinosaurs, in fact, are all over the Creation Museum: Visitors can plunk down $29.99 for a plastic apatosaurus in the gift shop. Their kids will be able to saddle up on the back of a model triceratops by the coffee bar. "Kids are fascinated by them," said Ken Ham, president of Answers in Genesis, who says the creatures have too long been used as propaganda for the evolutionist cause. "We like to say, 'You've captured them for evolution, and we're going to take them back,' " Ham said. The museum, with its flat-screen TVs, coffee bar and special-effects theater, is an attempt to go mainstream with an idea that has been widely discredited by modern science. And that is a concern for defenders of evolutionary theory. Campaign to Defend the Constitution, a project of the Tides Center that advocates science education and the separation of church and state, recently compared the museum to cigarette ads focusing on the young. "This is to science what Joe Camel was to health -- a crass marketing ploy that cynically preys on the impressionable minds of children," campaign co-director Clark Stevens said in a statement. Ham, a former Australian schoolteacher who founded his ministry in 1979, said he simply wants people to "think about the origins issue" in a new way. "You have secular museums in every major city that treat evolution as fact, and public schools around this nation treating evolution as fact, and they're worried about one Creation Museum? "If evolution is so obvious," he said with a smile, "why are they so worried?" Ham believes many modern Christians have strayed from the basic tenets of their faith because they learned in school that evolution, not Genesis, provided the best blueprint for the story of creation. Creationists already boast one smaller museum, called the Museum of Creation and Earth History, in Santee (San Diego County), as well as a number of roadside attractions in the region. The Kentucky museum takes creationist tourism to a new level. Its chief designer, Patrick Marsh, designed the "Jaws" and "King Kong" attractions at Florida's Universal Studios. Organizers are expecting to attract 250,000 yearly visitors, who will pay $9.95 to $19.95 for a ticket. Beyond the diorama of the dinosaurs and children is a reproduction of a narrow slot canyon from the Grand Canyon. A video on a flat-screen television asks "Have you ever wondered where canyons come from?" laying the groundwork for a recurring assertion: that the Grand Canyon was not carved out over millions of years by the Colorado River, but by a rush of water created by the great flood described in Genesis. The Answers in Genesis group believes the story of the ark to be literally true. After the ark ran aground in Central Asia, the museum says, the surviving animals repopulated the other continents by floating across the oceans on the "billions of trees" uprooted by the great deluge. It is those kinds of assertions that make scientists such as Lawrence Krauss laugh out loud. "That's remarkable," said Krauss, a physicist and astronomer at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. "Any child knows that when they make up a story, and unfortunately make up the facts, they have to make up more and more excuses to justify those facts."

Special Coverage, Palm Foleo Q & A Video Conversation with Jeff Hawkins and before my (sadly brief) hands-on with the Foleo , I was lucky enough to get to sit down for a chat with Jeff Hawkins along with Ryan Kairer of PalmInfocenter and a fellow from cnet. I had my video camera along and was all set to tape the whole thing. Hawkins, though, was understandably tired of having his game face on and said something to the tune of "Sure, you can video tape this and I guess I'll be a little more careful about it. Or not." The choice between getting a video of the inventor of the Treo and hearing his unfiltered thoughts on the Foleo and smartphones at large "ain't no choice at all." So I turned off the camera while Jeff turned up his excitement about Foleo. Here are TreoCentral's notes and thoughts on our conversation It's the best idea I've ever had If I learned nothing else from my trip to get a chance to see the Foleo in the "flesh" it's this: Jeff Hawkins either is genuinely excited about the Foleo or he's an incredibly good actor. He started our conversation by talking about a theme that's familiar to anyone who's been following the story of the Foleo: First the Palm Pilot created a new category, then the Treo did, now it's happening again with the Foleo. "We've made three 'category defining products.' This is the biggest one of all," said Hawkins. Given the relative skepticism with which the Foleo has been received, this is a very bold statement. Yet Hawkins is unabashed in his enthusiasm for the product. "A lot of people thought the Pilot was a stupid idea." Hawkins then went on an extended riff on the origins of the Palm Pilot. What Palm really intended to do was make a pocket computer, but of course in terms of cost and the then available chips, the technology wasn't ready for it yet. What it was, though, was a step in the direction they wanted to move. It was a way to get their foot in the door in the minds of consumers and into the market as well. Here was the lesson of the Pilot: "With any new product, you have to find somebody who wants to buy it." With the Pilot, that person was somebody looking to replace a bulky binder-style organizer. What Palm aimed for was the creation of a new category rather than try to just "shrink a computer." That's why Hawkins doesn't believe the UMPC is successful now and why it may never be - there's not a large enough group of 'initial customers.' The lessons of the Pilot heavily influenced Palm's choices when making the Foleo. The decision to focus on just a few core applications at launch (email, browsing, office, and phone sync) is a result of that decision. "It's really a two stage process." the target market for the Foleo? In a word, . Hawkins said he has received a lot a positive responses from executives at the conference. "They said, 'This is exactly what I've been wanting.'" While it's not surprising that Hawkins would describe positive responses to the Foleo in the midst of its announcement, the focus on executives is telling. Hawkins understands that the Foleo as it currently exists isn't necessarily the super-device we were looking for. But just as the Pilot started as 'just and organizer' and the VisorPhone started 'just as a phone slapped on a PDA,' (my quote, not his), the Foleo seems to be only as 'just a mobile companion.' Just before interviewing Hawkins, I hurriedly asked a bunch of folks to send me one question I should ask. Michael Ducker sent me one that had been sitting in the back of my mind all day - "Is it really a stealth product like the VisorPhone was?" Something Hawkins had said earlier in the day : clicked with me: He said he expects initial sales numbers to be small: "It's not going to be a driver in the short term. But it allows us to rethink how you design smartphones." So - "How does this allow you to do that, to rethink smartphones?" Not too surprisingly, this question really got Hawkins excited. "I can't really go into it [too much]." Hawkins then discussed a theme we've heard often from Palm Execs - the difficult tradeoffs in making a smartphone. A smartphone has a screen that's as large as possible, has a battery that will last throughout a full day of use, has a keyboard that's easy to type on, a processor, memory, etc. All these features have to be balanced very carefully - they limit the ways in which a smartphone can be designed. Suddenly, for Hawkins, having the Foleo allows him to make a sort of end-run around some of these issues (like the screen and keyboard, the two most-cited features of the Foleo). "I can think about these problems differently. It gives me a different palette I can use to think about apps. [...] It moves the burden of email [for example, to the Foleo], frees up the balance of functionality." Hawkins then returned to a theme that he's mentioned in the earlier he'd given about the Foleo. Imagine if you had "a ton of storage, a ton, basically unlimited storage" on your smartphone. Add that to the fact that you're no longer as constrained by all of those "tradeoffs" that usually apply to the smartphone's design. "I have to just give you a tease here. But that's the direction we're thinking." Hawkins would say no more. The key, I think, is two-fold. One: the Foleo, as it's currently being marketed (perhaps even as it's currently being made) hasn't achieved what Hawkins has planned for it yet. Two: Neither is the smartphone. 1. Quotes are as accurate as I can make them based on my scribbles, fyi.

Sign up to receive Security Resource Alerts that mirrors the real world to let users to connect with their neighbors, launched Tuesday with a new spin on social networking. Instead of anonymous interaction, Fatdoor lets users communicate directly with local neighbors and businesses, said Raj Abhyanker, CEO and co-founder of the company. Abhyanker launched the company with Chandu Thota, who was the lead developer for 's Virtual Earth mapping and location tool. Bill Harris, the former CEO of PayPal Inc. and , is an investor and chairman of the company. "We're trying to build something on the Internet that mirrors the real world," Harris said. "We call it a local community network. It is a social network that is based around the place you live and the ... people you know. It is not an anonymous activity; this is a social network for adults." Abhyanker said he came up with the idea while running for the city council of Cupertino, Calif., in 2005. After knocking on 3,000 doors as part of his canvassing, he noticed that most people didn't know their neighbors. He said he began thinking about how to use the Web to "enhance neighborhoods, to give the power to the few who are very active to use for the common benefit of all neighbors." The first release of Fatdoor is open to residents of Silicon Valley, with later releases expanding the site cities and towns throughout the U.S. The site was built using Virtual Earth maps, showing specific house and businesses as icons. The icons can be "claimed" by users to hold their online profiles, which can be viewed by others in the neighborhood looking for specific services, to start a club or for other purposes, Abhyanker said. As users add content, their neighbors can learn about local events or business deals, he added. The goal is to foster a group of active users in the neighborhood who can self-regulate content using the model. Eventually, Abhyanker said, Fatdoor could be used by community activists or civic groups for various projects, such as producing a neighborhood newspaper, he added. Harris said the business model for Fatdoor calls for the site to eventually be supported by national and local advertisers eager to target users in specific locations. The site will first list all businesses in the local Yellow Pages and then allow each of those companies to personalize the listings, he said. Users can then add reviews and comments about the businesses.

With this, the veil has been lifted in part from this controversial patent partnership. With this unveiling we now know that there is still no proof, other than Microsoft's flat unsupported statement, that Linux violates any of Microsoft's patents. We also know that it appears, as Novell CEO Ron Hovsepian has said, that Novell never agreed that Linux violated Microsoft's patents. In the agreement, as no less a figure than Richard M. Stallman, the author of the GPL, said not long after the Novell/Microsoft patent deal became public news, "Microsoft has not given Novell a patent license, and thus, section 7 of GPL version 2 does not come into play. Instead, Microsoft offered a patent license that is rather limited to Novell's customers alone." Stallman also said: "It turns out that perhaps it's a good thing that Microsoft did this now, because we discovered that the text we had written for GPL version 3 would not have blocked this, but it's not too late and we're going to make sure that when GPL version 3 really comes out it will block such deals. We were already concerned about possibilities like this, namely, the possibility that a distributor might receive a patent license which did not explicitly impose limits on downstream recipients but simply failed to protect them." The vast majority of people who were concerned with this matter agreed with Stallman. They saw the GPLv3 as blocking any future such partnerships between Microsoft, or other proprietary software companies, and open-source software businesses. The attorneys of the SFLC (Software Freedom Law Center) would come to see the interaction of the GPLv3 and the Novell/Microsoft patent deal in quite a different light. Richard Fontana, counsel for the SFLC, revealed this new view when he said, "Now that Microsoft has effectively become a distributor of Linux, by distributing some 50,000 or so Novell SLES coupons, it has perhaps unwittingly restricted its ability to sue Linux users over its patents. While this is particularly clear under the forthcoming Version 3 of the GPL, the Microsoft lawyers who helped craft the MS-Novell deal appear to have overlooked the fact that, by procuring the distribution of lots of free software under GPL Version 2, among other licenses, Microsoft has already lost some of its power to assert patents against subsequent distributors and users of that software."

ThinkFree brings social networking to documents Digg revolt highlights shortcomings of Web 2.0 view Firefox goes social with The Coop Adobes Apollo to revolutionize web apps? Telcos could miss out on mobile Web 2.0 opportunities Fatdoor brings together familiar social networking elements such as personal profiles, intra-personal connections, group networking and information sharing. It uses the Microsoft Virtual Earth online mapping platform to enable users to identify their area of interest and the location of other users. The company says an alpha site is initially available ( ) as an invitation-only trial and will be rolled-out in additional cities throughout the US over the coming months. It promises to kick off with rich maps and pre-populated data for more than 100 million households in the US. People will be able to "get to know their neighbours by exploring local profiles and interests, and discover new friends in the neighbourhood." Using the Fatdoor mail service, they will be able to contact their neighbours "in a non-invasive, non-threatening way." The Palo Alto based company is led by a number of technology industry veterans. Co-founder and CEO is Raj Abhyanker, a patent attorney, electrical engineer and former CEO of numerous Internet startups in the mid 1990s. These included AOL Classifieds.com (sold to AOL), MacInsider, Clay Pixel Studios, and Raj Abhyanker LLP (a patent law firm). Co-founder and CTO Chandu Thota previously worked at Microsoft where he was a central figure in building the Microsoft Virtual Earth online mapping platform and Live Search Maps. He has recently authored "Programming MapPoint" and "Virtual Earth in .Net" by O&#39;Reilly publishing. He is listed as an inventor on more than 14 patent applications for Microsoft related to geo-spatial mapping and technology. Jan Jannink, the Community Architect of Fatdoor, was a founder of imeem, a popular social network with more than one million members. He invented the database architecture and the data model for imeem. Chairman Bill Harris was formerly CEO of Intuit and PayPal. Fatdoor also has technology relationships with Amazon.com, Google Inc., and Yahoo! but has not revealed details of these.

IT and TELCO JOBS Has Jobs backed the wrong horse with Apple TV's YouTube access? Has Jobs backed the wrong horse with Apple TV's YouTube access? Thursday, 31 May 2007 The hamstrung Apple TV media player is finally showing signs of life, with Apple adding YouTube access and a 160GB hard drive, but getting into bed with GooTube might backfire on Steve Jobs. YouTube goes AppleTube as Apple TV gets upgrade More iPhone clues and rumours YouTube on your Apple TV Ol' Blue Eyes is back at iTunes Plus Its official: DRM-free music now on sale at iTunes Plus It was an obvious move from Apple in terms of what users want, I said back in February that a You Tube-compatible flash video player in the Apple TV could be enough to win over a massive slice on the non-tech savvy market . Instead YouTube is switching it&#39;s video format to Apple TV-friendly H.264. Still, I thought YouTube&#39;s legal wranglings might have scared Apple away. It won&#39;t be long before the copyright police try to drag Apple into one of the YouTube lawsuits, but if they were to take on Google and Apple they might find they&#39;ve bitten off more than they can chew. The bigger worry for Jobs is creating bad blood with the major content providers currently at war with YouTube, such as Viacom. Striking content deals for the various iTunes stores around the world (like Australia&#39;s sub-standard offering) could become even tricker if content providers see Apple in bed with the enemy. The iTunes store finally faces some serious competition for eyeballs in the form of services such as Joost, although the Apple TV has proven so easy to hack that people are already running Joost on it. Just like the iPod, the Apple TV is merely a vehicle for selling stuff at the iTunes store. Thanks to iTunes&#39; domination of the online content market, Jobs thinks he can dictate terms to the content providers. So far he&#39;s pulled it off, such as with the introduction DRM-free music, but will his luck hold out? Getting into bed with YouTube could be going too far.

Bill Gates yesterday took his vision for personal computers to a higher plane, where the mouse and keyboard are replaced by more natural interaction using voice, pen and touch. The co-founder of Microsoft unveiled a coffee-table-shaped "surface computer" which has a 30-inch display under a hard-plastic tabletop, allowing people to touch and move objects on screen for everything from digital finger painting and jigsaw puzzles to ordering off a virtual menu in a restaurant. The Surface computer also recognises and responds to special bar codes attached to everyday objects placed on its top, so cell-phone users can easily buy ringtones or change payment plans by placing their handsets on in-store displays, or a group of people gathered round the table can check out the photos on a digital camera placed on top. So-called "multi-touch" interfaces, which allow the user to gesture with several fingers at once to manipulate data, rather than relying on a mouse and menus, have been making waves in technological circles for some considerable time. One of the most eagerly-awaited examples is Apple's iPhone, scheduled to be released next month. It combines a mobile phone, a widescreen iPod with touch controls and an internet communications device with e-mail, web browsing, maps and searching in a small handheld device. It lets the user control everything with their fingers. Hewlett-Packard has also been looking at expanding multi-touch technology. So, too, have leading research scientists such as Jeff Han of New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, said it would manufacture the Surface com-puter itself and sell it initially to corporate customers, deploying the first units in November in Sheraton hotels, Harrah's casinos, T-Mobile stores and restaurants. The company is selling the Surface, essentially a Windows Vista PC tucked inside a shiny black table base, for between &#163;2500 and &#163;5000 each but aims to bring prices down to consumer levels in three to five years. Steve Ballmer, chief executive, said: "We see this as a multi-billion dollar category, and we envision a time when Surface computing technologies will be pervasive, from tabletops and counters to the hallway mirror." Analysts said the first few applications only hinted at what was possible. Matt Rosoff, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft, an independent research firm, said: "The potential for the interface is huge. Once you open it up to applications, what you can think of is limitless." Microsofts Surface could spell the demise of the mouse Chris Webb, spokesman for the British Computer Society, described it as "an exciting and revolutionary time". The society is celebrating its 50th anniversary and to give an idea of how far it had come, he said: "In 1957, one mainframe for a computer would be equivalent to one mobile phone today. "The fast pace of change is so dramatic that what one forecast would happen in 10 years' time will take place in five." Mr Webb predicted the mouse would be defunct in five years - which could mean two and a half. Microsoft held demonstrations of the technology last week and Mr Ballmer officially introduced it yesterday at Wall Street Journal's D: All Things Digital conference. Microsoft shunned its usual PC manufacturing partners and decided to take control of the Surface computer's hardware production using an undisclosed contract manufacturer. The company has a mixed record with new technology. Its Zune music player has not yet become a major challenger to Apple's iPod but its Xbox 360 game console has enjoyed early success in the battle of next-generation game machines. For years, Gates has championed touch-screen technology such as the tablet PC with little success but the Surface is a totally different shape and allows for multiple users. People really like it because it mimics what they do in the real world' Pete Thompson, Microsoft Surface general manager In a demonstration, Microsoft placed a digital camera with a wireless chip on the tabletop. The Surface recognised the camera and sent its pictures to the display, allowing people around the table to sift through them, grabbing and turning pictures or making them bigger or smaller by spreading or narrowing their fingers. Microsoft showed in another demonstration how Deutsche Telekom cell-phone operator T-Mobile USA, one of its launch partners, could deploy the computer in its stores. A customer can take a phone off the shelf, place it on the tabletop where it will recognise the device and pop up the handset's specifications and information to the screen. For a side-by-side comparison with another phone, the customer can put down a second handset next to the first phone. "It's drop-dead simple and people really like it, because it mimics what they do in the real world," said Pete Thompson, general manager of Microsoft's Surface computing business. Microsoft said at the launch it would deploy a virtual concierge for Harrah's Entertainment's casinos in Las Vegas and place the Surface computers in the lobbies of Starwood Hotel & Resorts Worldwide Sheraton hotels. Guests sitting in some Starwood Hotel lobbies will be able to cluster around the Surface to play music, then buy songs using a credit card or rewards card tagged with a bar code. In some hotel restaurants, customers will be able to order food and drinks, then split the bill by setting down a card or a room key and dragging their menu items "on to" the card. Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Jupiter Research, said Surface was "important for Microsoft as a promising new business, as well as demonstrating very concretely to the market Microsoft still knows how to innovate, and innovate in a big way". Tidal wave of technology began with simple charts The first computers were people. "Computer" was originally a job title: it was used to describe those human beings (predominantly women) whose job it was to perform the repetitive calculations required to compute such things as navigational tables and tide charts. One of the earliest attempts to build an all-electronic digital computer occurred in 1937 by JV Atanasoff, a professor of physics and mathematics at Iowa State University. Another candidate for granddaddy of the modern computer was Colossus, built during the Second World War by Britain to try to break the cryptographic codes used by Germany. Computers had been around for 20 years before the first microprocessor was developed at Intel in 1971. Bill Gates dropped out of college so he could concentrate on writing programs. In 1975 Paul Allen and Bill Gates developed BASIC for the Altair 8800 and Microsoft was born. Microcomputers first appeared in the 1970s. Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Computer, is credited with developing the first mass-market home computers. The Apple Macintosh made its debut in 1984. It featured a simple, graphical interface, used the 8-MHz, 32-bit Motorola 68000 CPU, and had a built-in 9in black-and-white screen. Microsoft's Windows 1.0 shipped in November 1985. By 1989, the company's sales had reached $1bn. &copy; All rights reserved.

Palm has hailed Foleo, which is slated for launch by the end of the summer, as a new category of mobile computing, what it calls "mobile companion," but many pundits say Foleo is little more than an inexpensive ultra-mobile PC. Except Foleo is a little heavy to be an ultra-mobile, tipping the scales at 2.5 pounds. It boasts a 10-inch display and as much as five hour&#0039;s battery life. Foleo automatically syncs with a user&#0039;s Treo, via Bluetooth, and is expected to also work with competing products at some future point, said Palm director of product marketing for Foleo Paul Cousineau. That would include RIM&#0039;s BlackBerry and the forthcoming iPhone from Apple. With a $500 price tag, the device is less expensive than most ultra-mobile PCs, which are handheld PCs that have all the functionality of a desktop. But Cousineau said Foleo doesn&#0039;t pretend to be an ultra-mobile because it does not add functionality to the Treo other than ease of use. The benefit to users is chiefly its large keyboard and display, Cousineau said. He said Palm intentionally chose a narrow set of applications to work on Foleo in order to help keep its power consumption low. "You will not find one [ultra-mobile PC] in any normal configuration that will give you a full five hours of use," Cousineau said. "This product is very much more like an appliance in terms of the complexity and ease of use of the product and the narrowness of functionality." Palm has kept Foleo&#0039;s power consumption down by doing away with a hard drive and instead making it a solid-state device. And it has a mobile microprocessor that is more similar to smartphone silicon than a notebook CPU. Foleo has what&#0039;s known as instant-on capability, which means it turns on and off with a single button, like any PDA. There is no hibernation mode. It also has one-button access to email and all the other types of functionality of the smartphone, Cousineau said. And because Foleo also has WiFi, it essentially turns the Treo into a dual-mode device. Palm is touting Foleo as the first in a line of new mobile products, which Cousineau said likely will include new devices to target both vertical and horizontal applications. "I think there&#0039;s a lot of opportunity for the product to go in a number of ways," he said. More media capabilities may be added as mobile microprocessing power increases. Windows Mobile capabilities are also on the horizon, he said, whether they are developed by Palm or third parties. Foleo may become a little thinner in the short to medium-term time frame, Cousineau said. "It&#0039;s really as small as it can get with a full-size keyboard," he said. Many pundits are panning the Foleo as little more than a screen and keyboard for the Treo and, at some future point, other smartphones. Turns out, this is precisely Palm&#0039;s intention with Foleo. But the company&#0039;s over-hyped marketing has left Treo followers feeling deflated. Indeed, a new category of mobile computing the Foleo is not. Still, Foleo deserves a little more credit than it&#0039;s getting in most of online reviews. Don&#0039;t underestimate the value of a full-size keyboard and relatively large screen to mobile workers, particularly those of Baby Boomer age. For anyone over 40, typing a meaningful email with your thumbs into a tiny screen is tricky for any extended period of time. Tricky enough for you to turn to your laptop as soon as possible. Not having to pack your relatively large laptop on your next road trip may well justify Foleo&#0039;s $500 price tag.

http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_6025485&cid San Jose Mercury News - Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals san jose / valley start / stop paper (From the last 24 hours) ACLU targets planner of so-called CIA torture flights Prosecutors: Aptos woman lived high life on &#36;1.5 million stolen... Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Article Launched: 05/30/2007 11:14:18 PM PDT CARLSBAD - The words that come to mind when trying to describe tech titans Bill Gates and Steve Jobs don't usually include "nostalgic," "sentimental" or "soft." Yet in a historic joint appearance at the D: All Things Digital Conference on Wednesday, the two were at times overcome about their history together. Indeed, by the end, both men seemed choked up by the emotion of the moment. Gates in particular took special pride in his role as co-founder and chairman of Microsoft. Even after being praised for his recent philanthropic efforts, Gates talked more about what he did in the technology industry than what his charitable foundation is doing now. "The most important work I got a chance to be involved in - no matter what I do - is the personal computer," Gates said. "That's my life's work." It's been quite a life for the two of them, and they have been at the center of the action for most of their careers. Jobs, co-founder and chief executive of Apple, noted that when they started working together in the mid-1970s, he and Gates were often the youngest people in the room. Now, he said, he's often the oldest. Paraphrasing a Beatles song, he added, "You and I have memories that are longer than the road that stretches out ahead." To be sure, the appearance wasn't a love fest. Jobs at times, as he's wont to do, seemed to get under Gates' skin. At one point he tried to convince Gates that Apple isn't trying to be mean by poking fun at the "PC guy," the lovable loser who stands in sharp contrast to Apple's cool "Mac guy" in a popular series of commercials. "The art of those commercials ... is for those guys to like each other," Jobs said. "The PC guy is what makes it all work, actually. It's worth thinking about." Needless to say, Gates didn't appear to be convinced. In an interview with Newsweek earlier this year, he'd even questioned the ads' veracity. Still, the two did show their mutual respect for each other. Gates, for instance, praised Jobs' aesthetic sense, noting that it sharply differed from his own sensibility, which is to approach problems from an engineering perspective. "I'd give a lot to have Steve's taste - in terms of intuitive taste for people and products," he said. "The way he does things, it's just different. It's magical." Similarly, Jobs said that Apple could have learned a lot from Microsoft's penchant for partnering with other companies in the industry. Partnering simply wasn't in Apple's DNA, and the company didn't learn how to do it until decades after its founding, he said. "The funny thing is Microsoft's one of the few companies we were able to partner with (where) that actually worked for both companies," he said. The conversation was moderated by longtime technology journalists Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg, who organized the event, and took place in front of such luminaries as /movie director George Lucas, domestic diva Martha Stewart and former AOL Chairman Steve Case. The event marked the first time Jobs and Gates have made a joint public appearance since the 1997 Boston Macworld event, when Gates joined Jobs via teleconference to announce a landmark deal between their two companies. The previous time the two appeared together at a public event was in the early 1980s. Jobs' participation in the event capped a long day for him and the company. Earlier in the day, the iconic CEO participated in a separate conversation with Mossberg. During that event, he announced that the company's Apple TV set-top box would soon allow users to watch YouTube videos from the Internet. Meanwhile, Apple announced early Wednesday morning that it has added unprotected digital songs from music label EMI to its iTunes music store as part of an agreement the companies announced in April. The company also announced that it was adding course lectures and other education materials for download from the iTunes store. The two tech titans have long been known for their rivalry. What isn't as well understood is that they and their companies also have a history of cooperation. Microsoft has been one of the most important software developers for the Macintosh, and the company arguably helped save Apple in 1997 with a &#36;150 million investment and a commitment to continue developing its Office suite for the Mac. On a personal level, Jobs and Gates were good enough friends in the 1980s to double date occasionally and for Gates to leave friendly prank calls on Jobs' answering machine. That said, Jobs is well known for taking pot-shots at his company's bigger rival. And he didn't disappoint on Wednesday. The company's iTunes software is one of the most popular programs on computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system, Jobs noted in his conversation earlier in the day with Mossberg. Indeed, he said, some users have written to tell Apple that it's their favorite Windows application, he said. "It's like giving a glass of ice water to somebody in hell," he said.

(file image) Washington DC (SPX) May 30, 2007 Michael Griffin NASA Administrator has told America's National Public Radio that while he has no doubt a trend of global warming exists "I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with." In an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep that will air in Thursday's edition of NPR News' Morning Edition, Administrator Griffin explains: "I guess I would ask which human beings - where and when - are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take." The comments come at a difficult time for the Bush Administration which is under growing pressure from other members of the G8 club which under the current Chair of Germany is pushing for global action on Co2 emissions. NASA scientists have also been in the spotlight in recent years for research papers and public statements that did not sit well with the Bush White House. After several highly public disagreements over the right of NASA scientists to speak their mind a stalemate was reached. But in recent weeks a new squabble over NASA has broken out in Washington with the new Democrat dominated Congress passing an increasingly critical eye over NASA and it's operations, where budget pressures are building against a backdrop of competing programs, centers and agendas. The transcribed excerpts were released by NPR on May 30 as a teaser to what will prove to be a an interview of much note in the next few days. One thing that's been mentioned that NASA is perhaps not spending as much money as it could on is studying climate change, global warming, from space. Are you concerned about global warming? I am aware that global warming -- I'm aware that global warming exists. I understand that the bulk of scientific evidence accumulated supports the claim that we've had about a one degree centigrade rise in temperature over the last century to within an accuracy of 20 percent. I'm also aware of recent findings that appear to have nailed down -- pretty well nailed down the conclusion that much of that is manmade. Whether that is a long term concern or not, I can't say. And I just wanted to make sure that I'm clear. Do you have any doubt that this is a problem that mankind has to wrestle with? I have no doubt that global -- that a trend of global warming exists. I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with. To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn't change. First of all, I don't think it's within the power of human beings to assure that the climate does not change, as millions of years of history have shown, and second of all, I guess I would ask which human beings - where and when - are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take. Is that thinking that informs you as you put together the budget? That something is happening, that it's worth studying, but you're not sure that you want to be battling it as an army might battle an enemy. Nowhere in NASA's authorization, which of course governs what we do, is there anything at all telling us that we should take actions to affect climate change in either one way or another. We study global climate change, that is in our authorization, we think we do it rather well. I'm proud of that, but NASA is not an agency chartered to quote "battle climate change."

The new street-racing adventure is called ProStreet, and is heading to Xbox 360, PS3, PC, Wii, DS, PS2, PSP and mobile this autumn. EA Black Box in Canada will be creating it, and it's back to the underbelly of the racing world we go, rubbing shoulders with Vin Diesel types at every turn. The graphics have undergone an overhaul and look suitably jaw-dropping, and the A.I. will also be much more aggressive and realistic this time around. But the biggest changes come in the form of the "Autosculpt" technology, which will let you customise not only the appearance of your car, but also its performance. Plus every crash and bump you pick up will leave noticeable, lasting dents and scratches on your beautiful bodywork. There's also what's being dubbed as, "a revolutionary online mode that will redefine the meaning of competitive social play". It's one step closer to the deep-immersion goal EA covets, and it will probably sell by the absolute truck-load as usual. "Need for Speed ProStreet accelerates street racing culture by providing the ultimate stage for the pursuit of supremacy," said Larry LaPierre, executive producer of the game. "This is a game about building the ultimate performance-tuned battle machine, taking it to multi-disciplinary showdowns all over the world and pitting your skills and reputation against the very best street racers."

Today marks the launch of the much rumoured, much hyped 'Palm Foleo' and for the life of me I can't work out why it exists. Apparently the first 'smartphone companion' it offers a slim and light laptop form factor (10in LCD, keyboard, Bluetooth, WiFi, 1.13Kg) but without anything like the same functionality. Instead the Foleo exists primarily to synch with your smartphone (initially a Palm, but Windows Mobile, RiM and Symbian devices in time), enabling users to open their device's emails and attachments or surf the web on a larger screen using more fully featured clients. Battery life is good for five hours of use and its Linux OS means it can be used on its own as a kind of stripped down laptop. Ok fine, but I have two major issues here: 1. Isn't the entire point of a smartphone so that you need to carry a laptop sized device around with you? going to carry a laptop sized device around with you why not carry Yes, the Foleo is cheaper than most slim line laptops at $599 ($499 for a limited time with a $100 in box rebate) but do you really want to own a smartphone, a laptop sized device to synchronise with your smartphone and a laptop to synchronise with your smartphone? Aren't our lives complicated enough?! Personally, I can't think of anything worse than adding yet another device into our lives that requires synchronisation. One laptop, one smartphone, one PC is quite enough thank you and I think most people would agree with me... Of course I may be completely wrong. Palm founder Jeff Hawkins describes it as "the most exciting product I have ever worked on" but surely  if popular (which it won't be) - it represents a massive backwards step for an industry which has spent the last few years trying to untie us from our laptops. And besides, I'm never wrong. Palm Launches Treo 750v Palm Announces Budget Treo &copy; 2003-2007 TrustedReviews.com Ltd. |

The table-shaped computer  initially targeting commercial establishments  does away with the mouse and keyboard in favour of a large 30in multi-touch screen. Much like Apple's iPhone, this interface allows multiple gestures to be performed on the screen simultaneously, think: two businessmen analysing documents or  if you're cooler  picture Minority Report (only on a table). Little else was given away about the horsepower behind Surface, but we do know it will run on Windows Vista and sport 10/100 Ethernet, wireless b/g and Bluetooth 2.0 connectivity. As for the form factor (read: table) itself this is 22 inches high, 21 inches deep and 42 inches wide with an acrylic tabletop and power coated steel interior frame. Microsoft aims to put the Surface in hotels, restaurants, retail establishments and public entertainment venues before the end of the year and projects costs between $5,000 and $10,000 (£2,525 and £5,050) depending on configuration. First partnerships are with Harrah's Entertainment whose properties include Caesars Palace and the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide and T-Mobile USA. Microsoft said it aims to put cheaper versions of Surface in homes within three to five years. This sounds great in theory though I hope during this time the company considers other shapes (the mirror, perhaps?) for the good of our spinal cords...

(MSFT.O) is making the biggest splash with three games this week. Which phone company plans to use Microsoft's new Surface computer? Test Your Knowledge -- More Questions Resources for anyone who runs a small business or wants to start one. Small Business on the Net Save & Share Article The software giant's Xbox 360 console gets the long-awaited racing simulator "Forza Motorsport 2," as well as "Shadowrun," a shooter that mixes swords and sorcery with modern firepower such as rocket launchers and sniper rifles. PC purists who sniff at the idea of playing a shooter on a console will finally get their hands on a Windows version of "Halo 2," Microsoft's blockbuster sci-fi title for the original Xbox that came out nearly three years ago. "Shadowrun" is also for sale in a PC version, and Microsoft is bridging the gap between PCs and consoles by letting players of the different versions combat each other over the company's Live online service. "Forza 2," which was delayed from its original release date in late 2005, puts players behind the wheels of more than 300 super-realistic cars. Players can customize the performance and appearance of their rides and share them online. Dan Greenawalt, game director for "Forza 2," said the game should do well despite hitting the market at the start of what is the industry's slowest season. "We slipped (the release of) this game out and the reason is that you don't ship a date, you ship a game. It just wasn't the game we wanted to make," Greenawalt said. "I can't speak to the broader portfolio, but I think it's a great game at suboptimal time." 's (7974.OS) Wii console have complained about a dearth of new titles, and they get a respite with "Mario Party 8," a collection of multiplayer mini games that make use of the machine's motion-sensitive controller. "One game that will be a bigger hit than expected will be 'Mario Party 8', not because it's a particularly good game but because everything for the Wii is doing well right now," said Dan Hsu, editor-in-chief of gaming magazine EGM. In mid-June, Nintendo will also offer "Big Brain Academy: Wii Degree," a console version of its popular mind exercise series for its DS handheld. "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas," the popular tactical shooter from French publisher Ubisoft (UBIP.PA), storms onto 's (6758.T) PlayStation 3 in mid-June. But PS3 fans won't get an exclusive title until the end of July with the debut of "Lair," a gorgeous fantasy game in which players control flying, fire-breathing dragons. While not expected to drive sales of the PS3, "Lair" is an important addition to Sony's stable of games until it rolls out more A-list titles for the holidays. "The PlayStation 3 seems to have a lack of killer apps ... but games like 'Lair' are more like Sony saying we're building a solid library," Hsu said. "You don't want to be defined by just one game." In terms of overall sales, the PS3 is straggling behind the Xbox 360 and the surging Wii, but Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo are all saving their best games for the end of the year, when the industry racks up half of its annual sales. "Market share is not going to be decided this summer, it will happen this holiday season," said Evan Wilson, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. "It's summertime, there are not a lot of hardware sales, and people are outside and not inside playing games." AP CEO Urges Media to Adapt to the Web Burglar Steals West Va.

Cisco's Chambers pushes video, Web 2.0 New and improved version of Gozi Trojan on the loose MySpace to turn over sex offender data to AGs Microsoft rolls out mashup tool set for nontechies German researchers find new storage medium From vapourware to scareware, Microsoft keeps innovating Penguins in nude girlspace Nudity in 'Halo 2' escapes Microsoft's notice Apple's new MacBooks aren't so different Fatdoor.com, a website that mirrors the real world to let users to connect with their neighbours, launched this week with a new spin on social networking. Instead of anonymous interaction, Fatdoor lets users communicate directly with local neighbours and businesses, says Raj Abhyanker, CEO and co-founder of the company. Abhyanker launched the company with Chandu Thota, who was the lead developer for Microsoft 's Virtual Earth mapping and location tool. Bill Harris, the former CEO of PayPal and Intuit, is an investor and chairman of the company. "We're trying to build something on the internet that mirrors the real world," Harris says. "We call it a local community network. It is a social network that is based around the place you live and the ... people you know. It is not an anonymous activity; this is a social network for adults." Abhyanker says he came up with the idea while running for the city council of Cupertino, Calif., in 2005. After knocking on 3,000 doors as part of his canvassing, he noticed that most people didn't know their neighbours. He said he began thinking about how to use the web to "enhance neighbourhoods, to give the power to the few who are very active to use for the common benefit of all neighbours." The first release of Fatdoor is open to residents of Silicon Valley, with later releases expanding the site cities and towns throughout the US. The site was built using Virtual Earth maps, showing specific house and businesses as icons. The icons can be "claimed" by users to hold their online profiles, which can be viewed by others in the neighbourhood looking for specific services, to start a club or for other purposes, Abhyanker says. As users add content, their neighbours can learn about local events or business deals, he adds. The goal is to foster a group of active users in the neighbourhood who can self-regulate content using the Wikipedia model. Eventually, Abhyanker says, Fatdoor could be used by community activists or civic groups for various projects, such as producing a neighbourhood newspaper, he adds. Harris says the business model for Fatdoor calls for the site to eventually be supported by national and local advertisers eager to target users in specific locations. The site will first list all businesses in the local Yellow Pages and then allow each of those companies to personalise the listings, he says. Users can then add reviews and comments about the businesses.

The question is: why didn't T. rex eat other ark animals? SIX days, phew. I always thought it was a tight squeeze, but thanks to the good folk at the Creation Museum, in Kentucky, I know it's possible. You can create life, the universe and everything in six days. You just have to be God. Forget the time scale, the billions of years of evolution, the Big Bang. Forget the dinosaurs and Darwin's theory. God did it in exactly six days, and then he had a rest. It's all here at the $US27 million ($A33 million) museum, the literal telling of Genesis in animatronics, dioramas, lifelike models of men and women, Noah's Ark and a planetarium. There's a park where visitors can walk through the pivotal moments of creation. Let's start at where God forms Adam from dust (where did the dust come from?), then we can take a loop to where Adam names the animals, look into where Eve is created from Adam's side, see the tree of life and then we can see the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Not forgetting to witness where the ground is cursed and how Adam must toil for food and where Cain kills Abel. You can see all this on the website . The museum expects hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, which is not surprising given that an opinion poll last year in the US by CBS found 51 per cent of those surveyed believed God created people in their present form. Another poll, according to , estimated that 50 million Americans believe in the Genesis view of creation. Of course, people can believe any old thing they like. My grandmother used to say insincere praise from someone was just that person "pissing in your pocket". Though I loved Nan's colourful use of language, as to what she meant, I've no idea. Which is rather a neat evolutionary way back to the museum. I've no idea why there should be dinosaurs at the same time as people. The museum says there were, which leads to the question: how the heck did Noah get that on board his ark? I can understand how you could push a sheep up a gangplank, but a ? Noah must have been a fast talker, or perhaps he had a Schmacko dog biscuit. But then what happened on board the ark? Perhaps all the creatures great and small had a snooze and decided not to eat each other. Still, if people want to believe the universe bloomed into reality 6000 years ago, of course that's their right. The museum calls the Bible "the history book of the universe". Visitors are taken on a journey through that history "based on the 7 Cs of History: Creation, Corruption, Catastrophe, Confusion, Christ, Cross, Consummation". I have two other Cs: the Cradle of Civilisation. It's a crazy idea I know, but what the Sumerians started there I am continuing here on this keyboard as these words are formed &#151; I'm writing. Those clever Sumerians, fancy inventing writing 5000 years ago. You would have thought if they had seen a dinosaur they would have written it down on a tablet. The US has been the battleground between creationists and Darwinists for more than a century. The fiercest fight has been, and still is, in schools, beginning with Tennessee banning the teaching of evolution in the classroom. This led to the celebrated Scopes trial at which, according to America's National Public Radio, defence attorney Clarence Darrow argued that "we find today as brazen and as bold an attempt to destroy learning as was ever made in the Middle Ages". He lost. Fifty years later the state repealed the ban, but the issue of how to teach students about the origins of life has never gone off the radar across the country. The Creation Museum's director is Ken Ham, an Australian. He is a former science teacher who has moved to the US. He told : "You'd never find something like this in Australia." At least on that point, there is no dispute. As to the genesis of life. All the proof is before us, it's just how it is interpreted, he says. Where one might see a rib cage, for instance, another might see the wonder of Eve's creation. In the same week that the museum opened came news of astronomers having found 28 new planets spinning around other stars, raising the possibility of life in the far, far distance. Perhaps one of those planets has a creation museum, too. Who knows? Warwick McFadyen is a senior writer. When you see news happening: SMS/MMS: 0406 THE AGE (0406 843 243), or us.

http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/soa/Kill-the-patents-kill-the-problem/0,130061733,339277961,00.htm&cid Kill the patents, kill the problem: News - Software - ZDNet Australia Skip to main content ZDNet Australia - Where Technology Means Business Kill the patents, kill the problem 30 May 2007 11:22 AM Novell's decision to acquire Suse back in 2003 was a smart move for a struggling company. Having seen the market lead of its NDS directory product gradually eroded by Microsoft's Active Directory alternative and Windows NT, Novell was a company looking for an identity. Buying a way into the open-source community helped it plug right back into the zeitgeist -- and more importantly, made Wall Street sit up and take notice again. Four years on, Novell is still in the game -- albeit not at the level it once enjoyed. Although results for the first quarter of this year show that revenue from Linux products was up by 46 percent compared to a year ago, the company as a whole is just about breaking even. The high-level partnership with Microsoft announced last year provided a short-term injection of cash and tackled some integration issues for businesses looking to marry Linux with Windows. The open-source community was not impressed by some of those issues, consisting as they did of Microsoft's unsubstantiated claims of Linux's software-patent infringement. Some details of the Microsoft pact have emerged, thanks to a SEC filing made by Novell late on Friday; the timing, just before a holiday weekend, raising suspicions that bad news was being buried. The main thing to emerge is that Novell has conceded that changes to the latest version of the General Public License (GPL) -- the licence that underpins the use and distribution of much open-source software -- could prevent a key part of its pact with Microsoft. The fact that Microsoft could see a high-profile and costly deal with an open-source player damaged may explain why the software giant has been on the patent offensive of late. Last week's announcement of a deal with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to fight patents has been seen by some as a damage limitation effort by Novell with the aim of winning back friends from the open-source community. That's a cynical view -- moreover, one that's unhelpful. Only open source's opponents will benefit from splits in the community. Whatever Novell's motivations in its dealing with Microsoft and subsequently with the EFF, the fact remains that if software patents are shown to be the harmful and counterproductive mistake we believe them to be, the industry will benefit in many ways. The community must remain united with this in mind. Nothing else matters. This story originally appeared on Print feature brought to you by GPLv3 threatens Microsoft-Novell pact?

'Google Gears' Shift Web to Offline Google has announced "Google Gears" for developers; an open source technology for creating offline Web applications. "Google Gears" marks an important step in the evolution of Web applications because it addresses a major user concern: availability of data and applications when there's no Internet connection available, or when the connection is slow or unreliable. Reportedly, the new software will run both online and offline, affording users the flexibility to work anytime anywhere, including at the remotest of locations. All the user needs to do is install a plug-in into Web browsers, and the software will open an offline door to applications that till now were accessible only via an Internet connection. Google hopes that in the long term, "Google Gears" will help the industry as a whole move towards a single standard for offline capabilities that all developers could use. Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer of Google, said, "With 'Google Gears' we are tackling a key limitation of the browser in order to make it a stronger platform for deploying all types of applications, and enabling a better user experience. We believe strongly in the power of the community to stretch this new technology to the limits of what's possible, and ultimately emerge with an open standard that benefits everyone." Google is offering "Google Gears" as a free, fully open source technology in order to help not just Google applications but all Web applications. For starters, the Google Reader feed reader (http://reader.google.com) is available with Gears-enabled offline capabilities. Meanwhile, the company also plans to add other programs such as e-mail, calendar, word processing, and spreadsheet to its list of Gears-enabled offerings. As of now, Google has partnered with Adobe Systems to use "Google Gears" in their products. Have an opinion on this product?Disagree with the review?

The technology, called Google Gears, would allow users of computers, phones and other devices to manipulate Web services like e-mail, online calendars or news readers whether online, intermittently connected to the Web or completely offline. By bridging the gulf between new Web services and the older world of desktop software, where any data changes are stored locally on users' machines, Google is pushing the Web into whole new spheres of activity and posing a challenge to rival Microsoft Corp. , leader in the desktop software era.

http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20070530/google_enhances_maps_by_adding_street_view_feature-id-104282.html&cid Google enhances Maps by adding âStreet Viewâ feature - The Money Times Advertise on this site Thursday 31st of May 2007 09:45:30 PM - Loans & Credit - Science & Medicine Bollywood News & Gossip Shopping comparison and reviews Google enhances Maps by adding âStreet Viewâ feature - May 30, 2007 - 0 comments Complimenting its popular mapping technology, Web search giant Google Inc. on Tuesday launched "Street View", a new Google Map service that provides users a street-level picture of downtown areas of various U.S. cities. With the new "Street View" feature in Google Maps, users will be able to view and navigate with a 360-degree view of the selected cities, including San Francisco area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver and Miami. While introducing the Street View at the O'Reilly Where 2.0 Conference 2007 in San Jose, Google claimed that the new feature places Google Map users at the road level, offering them a deeper and more detailed experience of the location than aerial images provide. "With Street View users can virtually walk the streets of a city, check out a restaurant before arriving, and even zoom in on bus stops and street signs to make travel plans," said John Hanke, director of Google Earth and Maps. Initially pitched for selected cities, the street level imagery will soon be available for other metropolitan regions, Google said in a statement. Early last month, the Mountain View, California based online advertising and internet search giant launched âMy Mapsâ, another Google Map service that lets users to create customized maps with specific locations and picture. According to Google, this new mapping tool that can be found in a tab on the left side of the map interface allows users create their own maps to destinations, throwing in their own text, photos and videos for others to see. It even enables non-technical users easily annotate and share maps. Googleâs street-level viewing features are not new as Amazon.com Inc.âs A9.com already has showed street-level views of roughly two dozen major U.S. cities through its BlockView mapping service, which was launched in early 2005. However, it discontinued the feature last year in September. Google on Tuesday also announced the launch of a tool for independent software developers to build mini-applications that can be displayed within Google Maps. Called Mapplets, these gadget applications can display a range of information, from housing listings to crime data. Mapplets will be available in the Maps site for users to choose from and apply to their maps. Mapplets, which currently is in preview mode, can be found in a special version of Google Maps for users who want to try them out. The same day, Microsoft has announced that its Microsoft Live Search Maps service will expand to include more cities worldwide by the end of summer. The world's leading software-producing company last year in November announced the launch of its new mapping service, 'Virtual Earth 3-D' to further add to the services being offered on its Live Search. Microsoft initially included three-dimensional tours of 15 US cities, including San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Detroit, Phoenix, Houston, Baltimore, Atlanta, Denver, Dallas and Fort Worth. Now, Microsoft has enhanced its Live Search Map service by adding 3D cityscapes of U.S. cities Austin, Texas; Cape Coral, Florida; Cincinnati; Indianapolis; Savannah, Georgia; and Tampa, Florida. Northampton, England, and Ottawa, Canada, also will be featured as 3D cityscapes via this service. The 3-D feature lets users zoom in and out of these urban areas and get a three-dimensional view of buildings, terrain, and the like. Until now, the earth was flat for us, but websites such as Google Earth have given us a bird's eye view of the world. Googleâs popular Earth software allows a third of the worldâs population obtain aerial views of their homes and neighborhoods. The largest search engine on the Web, Google has distributed more than 100 million free copies of Earth since June 2005. Google Maps software is tied to search engine giant's online service and informs users about traffic conditions in 30 U.S. cities, provides driving directions, movable/scalable maps, and local search results for business locations as well as satellite and aerial views. Google Maps is currently the third-most popular map site after Time Warner Inc.'s AOL online businessâs Mapquest and Yahoo Maps, which already offer similar function.

Need for Speed screeches up ProStreet New title in the popular EA driving game franchise announced, will be coming to multiple formats this autumn. am PT Need for Speed will be steered in a new direction in its latest iteration, titled Need for Speed ProStreet, which is being developed by Electronic Arts Black Box studio in Vancouver, Canada. Focused on racing showdowns against top street racers, the title promises "impeccable precision and impressively detailed photo-realistic graphics." The new game will show dents, scratches, and crumpled body panels as the gamer's car collides with other vehicles and objects. For the first time in the series, racers will be able to directly impact their car's performance, as well as personalise its appearance, EA says. Need for Speed ProStreet will also feature an online mode, and an "aggressive and skilled" AI system. The game's executive producer, Larry LaPierre, commented, "This is a game about building the ultimate performance-tuned battle machine, taking it to multi-disciplinary showdowns all over the world and pitting your skills and reputation against the very best street racers." The first Need for Speed game, also developed by EA Black Box, was released in 1994, and a multitude of other games in the series followed, most recently Need for Speed Carbon in 2006. Need for Speed ProStreet will be available on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, DS, PC, and mobile platforms, and is slated for release this fall. &laquo; Back to Today's News to post a comment on this story! BAH! I don't believe it. All what do EA say is just marketing. They tell us that everything gonna be ok' ... but they want make us to believe that. Because if we'll start waiting for this game, we may buy it. am PT to rate this comment U-uker am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) dont like underground style NFS, prefer most wanted style am PT to rate this comment timts am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) Carbon wasn't good enough for me to buy this no matter what. am PT to rate this comment jcloverboy am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) On second thought, Gamespot, can we just go without news reports of EA games....forever? The next time I ever want to see EA mentioned in an article, it must include the word "liquidation" next to it. am PT to rate this comment DonutTrooper am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) I feel this is a stupid move on EAs part. There are enough "realistic" simulator games with Forza and to some degree even Project Gotham. Stay with what works. Go back to the "Most Wanted" formula. Stay away from simulating, or even making weak road games like "Carbon". Of course, I think I would like Carbon over this new game... am PT to rate this comment dentedskillet am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) "The new game will show dents, scratches, and crumpled body panels as the gamer's car collides with other vehicles and objects.

I think that all the customization and details on cars took a lot away from the game play. I just don't like how they made the street racing genre the base of a formerly good franchise. No offense, but every NFS:U game I've played had me make the car longer than drive the car. am PT to rate this comment DonutTrooper am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) EA games are truely multi-platform.... am PT to rate this comment onlineps2player am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) Aren't there already too many streetracing NFS games out there....

Underground was a really fresh step and a great racing game. U2 is crap: EA messed up in all the cool things of Underground. Most Wanted is more of the same thing. the same Hard-to-master/Easy-to-fail Driving mechanics of U2. The only GREAT thing in MW are the police and the HEAT CHARGED police chases.... But nothing else. Carbon is almost the worse in the series (U2 is really bad) I don't like Carbon at all. And now this. If this game returns to the roots of Need for Speed then IM IN, but if is another underground milking game the Screw you EA. am PT to rate this comment AngelCage am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) Step it up, more and more. NExt gen console hardware and software provide for more and more effects, calcs and physics. Hope fully developers can make a next gen game for PS3 and XB360 and then port down to PS2 and not the other way around. Sounds they have a great plan, hopefully the game will be more than meets the eye. am PT to rate this comment blancobo am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) EA Black Box had nothing to do with the original game, and as mentioned, damage was in NFS Porsche Unleashed. Do some fact checking, GS! am PT to rate this comment ferrarimanf355 am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) EA is milking all of their series now. They have to realize that gamers don't want the same game with nothing more than a few tweaks and graphical improvements, even though we keep buying them. Need for Speed was tired out years ago in my opinion, along with all of their sports lineup. Battlefield and Burnout are really the only EA games I enjoy anymore. Maybe those new IPs they're coming out with this year will be decent. am PT to rate this comment metroidlink1030 am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) Its a great game but they should release it like every year and a half or every 2 years. But heck they can realse it every other week if its a good game and so far non of the NFS titles(except underground 2) suck so keep it up! am PT to rate this comment stewart24 am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) I've been waiting for games like these on ps2.

This technology is designed to keep interference away from the iPhone that other gadgets and devices might cause. Just a small detector chip is all it takes. Apple plans on alerting you also when your signal becomes fuzzy or interrupted via audio or text. Here&#8217;s the kicker, though. Although the patent doesn&#8217;t mention the iPhone at all, it clearly states that the technology is designed for a cellphone with media capabilities. Sounds like an iPhone to me!

Loving Star Trek is about as dorky as a dork can get. But one Star Trek fan had the last laugh when he sold his one bedroom flat for more than the market value. Tony Alleyne sold his home that he transformed into the deck of the starship Voyager for a staggering $843,242 or Â£425,000. As you would imagine, transforming your bachelor pad into a flight deck is not an easy (or cheap) task. Tony spent nearly Â£30,000 and eight-hours a day for two years working on the project. When completed, he went and did what any shrewd businessman would do: he sold it on eBay. Tony hasn&#8217;t announced his next project, but a Pirate-themed home would be pretty badass to say the least.

But in the interest of generating site traffic, and to secure bragging rights of being &#8220;first!&#8221; if it&#8217;s somehow real, and because we&#8217;re reckless, we bring it to you now. Our Trusted, Reliable Source&trade; at the WSJ&#8217;s D conference that fed us all the was chatting with some other PR types who work for Apple during . He/She said they were nervous over Mr. Jobs accidentally spilling secrets two weeks before its official unveiling at . The source said something jokingly about how it&#8217;s really a re-designed version of Vista, and, to their surprise, the PR type said, &#8220;No, Vista runs great on the new Macs by itself, and Bootcamp 2 lets us ship it as an add-on option for dual-boot.&#8221; Or something to that effect. We&#8217;re thinking the Apple PR person was messing with our source, the idea is to run ideas up the flagpole to see if they fly. We really don&#8217;t see any Macs shipping with dual-boot to Windows anytime soon, but Steve has surprised us before, so who knows? We mark the likelihood as very low, but stranger things have happened. Thanks for giving me something to post on a slow news day, Apple PR dude/lady!

Google Inc. said on Tuesday it was introducing street-level map views of various U.S. cities, giving Web users a panoramic, 360-degree images as well as the overhead views Google Maps has offered. REUTERS/Steve Marcus SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc. said on Tuesday it was introducing street-level map views of various U.S. cities, giving Web users a panoramic, 360-degree images as well as the overhead views Google Maps has offered. With the new "Street View" feature in Google Maps, street level imagery is available for maps of the San Francisco area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver and Miami, and will soon expand to other metropolitan regions, Google said in a statement. Users looking at Google Maps through a Web browser can navigate around a city, "virtually" walking the streets, checking out restaurants and landmarks and even zoom in on bus stops or street signs to make travel plans. ADVERTISEMENT (article continues below) Google is playing catch-up with street-level viewing features, following in the footsteps of A9.com's BlockView mapping feature introduced in early 2005 and showing street-level views in roughly two dozen major U.S. cities. A9.com, a unit of Amazon.com Inc. , discontinued the feature in September 2006. A9 Chief Executive Udi Manber subsequently joined Google as vice president of engineering. has offered what it calls a "birds-eye" view on parts of its MSN Virtual Earth three-dimensional mapping service for several big U.S. cites since late in 2005. Google also announced plans for "Mapplets," a tool for independent software developers to build mini-applications that be displayed within Google Maps. Mapplets can display a variety of information, from housing listings to crime data as well as ways to measure distances between different points on the map. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo Inc. and MapQuest, a unit of Time Warner Inc.'s AOL online business, all continue to compete aggressively to create new online mapping features, said analyst Greg Sterling of Sterling Market Intelligence. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of Web sites now rely on one of the major online map providers to create hybrid mapping applications, popularly known as "mashups," he estimated. Google made the announcements at the Where 2.0 conference taking place in San Jose this week. More details can be found at http://maps.google.com/preview.

Marois May 30 (Bloomberg) -- Two humpback whales may have found their way back into the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay after wandering off their migration path for more than two weeks. The mother and calf, dubbed Delta and Dawn, were last seen 8:30 p.m. yesterday within 5 miles (8.3 kilometers) of the Golden Gate Bridge. They may have slipped under the bridge overnight and into open sea, said Bernadette Fees, a deputy director with the California Department of Fish and Game. ``It is reasonable they&#39;ve made their way out,&#39;&#39; Fees said this evening. The duo, which wandered off course en route to Alaska, attracted crowds to the banks of the Sacramento River as they meandered upstream starting about May 13. After resisting efforts to drive them back south toward the ocean, the whales thrilled rescuers yesterday by crossing back into San Pablo Bay, just north of San Francisco Bay. ``We all cheered like, `Yay!&#39;&#39;&#39; Jim Oswald, a spokesman for the Marine Mammal Center, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ``It&#39;s been really exhilarating.&#39;&#39; Today probably marked the end of a weeks-long detour during which the whales traveled as far as 70 miles (112 kilometers) off course. By May 20, they had reached a dead end at the Port of Sacramento, northeast of San Francisco. They turned downriver, then spent more than a week stalled in fresh water. Their unwillingness to head back to the Pacific frustrated rescuers, who tried to drive the whales homeward. Scientists fired on the whales with water cannons, played sound recordings of an Orca feeding on a whale and even car- alarm noise to try to force them toward the ocean. Eventually, the whales headed downriver on their own. Marine biologists and veterinarians worried for the whales&#39; health as they lingered in the river. Both animals had cuts on their backs, probably from boat propellers, and they developed skin blisters from the fresh water. The whales were given injections of antibiotics to stave off infections. ``As far as letting nature take its own course and letting them die, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an option because their injuries are a result of human activities,&#39;&#39; Frances Gulland, director of veterinary science at the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, said during a May 23 press briefing. ``We have some obligation to compensate for what we&#39;ve done to these animals.&#39;&#39; Humpback whales, which can live as long as 80 years and weigh as much as 30 tons, were hunted to near extinction until they were listed as an endangered species in the 1960s. There are less than 6,000 left in the Pacific Ocean, according to the Marine Mammal Center. The whales startled rescuers on May 27 by swimming more than 24 miles downstream, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. They moved south along the delta of the Sacramento River, California&#39;s largest, and entered bay waters yesterday. A flotilla of 12 boats accompanied them to offer protection from large ships, and to prevent the animals from turning back in the wrong direction. As the duo returned to saltier waters, their skin conditions improved, Oswald said. When the whales were marooned, crowds gathered at marinas in Rio Vista and the Port of Sacramento, trying to catch a glimpse of the 45-foot (13.7-meter) mother and the 25-foot calf. During the rescue effort, more than 2,600 suggestions from the public poured into a special e-mail account set up by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. One e-mail suggested using helicopters to harass the animals downriver, while another proposed building a fake whale with an outboard motor to lead them to the Pacific. A Navy dolphin squad might be able to guide the whales home, according to one e-mail. And a psychic asked to read the whales&#39; minds. ``There have been some real interesting folks who&#39;ve contacted us,&#39;&#39; Fees said. The rescue team included the Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration personnel, the state Department of Fish and Game and the Governor&#39;s Office of Emergency Services, as well as local law enforcement.

May 22: One of the two lost humpbacks slaps her tail on Sacramento River near Rio Vista, Calif. SAN FRANCISCO &#151; Two lost seen just before sunset Tuesday nearing their ocean home after a two-week sojourn through inland waterways may have slipped back into the Pacific overnight. Rescuers launched several boats in an effort to find the mother humpback and her calf Wednesday morning, but have not spotted the whales, said Bernadette Fees, deputy director of the California Department of Fish and Game "If they have gone out and made their way past the Golden Gate, they have done so quietly," Fees said. &#8226; Click here to visit FOXNews.com's Natural Science Center. The pair were last seen Tuesday night less than 10 miles from the Golden Gate after they passed under another busy bridge and entered The whales passed under the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge on Tuesday afternoon, the last bridge along the pair's route before reaching the Golden Gate. If the humpbacks were able navigate south around Marin County's Tiburon Peninsula and nearby Angel Island, few obstacles would have been left on their route past Alcatraz to the Pacific Ocean.

Authorities sent several boats west of the Golden Gate to try to confirm the whales had returned to the ocean, officials said. "The assumption is if we have not sighted the mother and calf by late afternoon that they have made their way out to the Pacific," Fees said. The duo was first spotted May 13 and got as far as 90 miles inland to the Port of Sacramento before turning around. Biologists originally had planned to attach a satellite tracking tag to the mother humpback, but gusty winds and malfunctioning equipment stymied that effort. Despite the apparently anticlimactic end to the humpbacks' saga, which has attracted thousands to Northern California waterfronts, biologists said the chance to closely observe the pair for so long was invaluable for science. "While they may have gone on their way, we still have the benefit of all the information we haven't had access to before," Fees said. "If we learned anything about these two, it is that they will do what they do when they want to do it." Ariadne Green, 57, of Vallejo, was one of many who came to catch what may have been a final glimpse of the pair Tuesday after traveling last week to Rio Vista, where the whales circled for a week before heading ocean-ward. She described the humpbacks' inland visit as a "profound spiritual experience" but was equally grateful for their departure. "They need to go home now because their health is in jeopardy," Green said. "It's good to know they're on their way back." Biologists said the saltier water where the mother humpback whale and her calf had been swimming since leaving Rio Vista helped reverse some of the health problems caused by long exposure to fresh water. Lesions that had formed on the humpbacks' skin over the weekend appeared to be sloughing off, Fees said. Scientists also reported that a coating of algae that was clinging to the mother farther upriver had fallen away. Recent photographs showed that serious wounds suffered by both whales also had appeared to begin healing, said Rod McInnis, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Antibiotics were injected into the whales on Saturday to try to slow the damage from the gashes, likely from a boat's keel. A convoy of boats had been escorting the pair to protect them from heavy ship traffic in the bay.

Toshiba&#039;s AMD Laptops Due in Fall A few more details emerge about the three energy-efficient Turion-powered notebooks. Part 1 of a special five-part series. Martyn Williams, IDG News Service Wednesday, May 30, 2007 7:00 AM PDT A little more detail is known about the new laptops from Toshiba Corp. that will use processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Toshiba will launch three laptops in its Satellite range in North America based on AMD's Turion 64 X2 dual-core chip and M690 chipset, AMD said on Wednesday. Toshiba, which confirmed plans on Tuesday for AMD machines but offered no details, said Wednesday that the computers will be available in the third quarter. The M690 chipset has just been launched by AMD and will, according to the company, help reduce power consumption and lead to a 25 percent increase in battery life compared to the previous-generation AMD platform. The Japanese PC maker, which ranked fourth in the laptop market in the first quarter of this year, hasn't used AMD chips in laptops since 2000. In an antitrust lawsuit filed against processor-rival Intel Corp. in 2005 AMD alleged that Toshiba stopped using its chips after receiving a "very substantial" payment from Intel. Toshiba was receiving "market development funds" from Intel worth about US$25 million to $30 million per quarter and those would be jeopardized if it used AMD chips, the lawsuit alleged. AMD is stepping up pressure against Intel in the laptop market and recently disclosed plans to launch a new laptop platform called Puma in 2008. Puma is AMD's answer to Intel's recently launched Santa Rosa laptop platform. The two companies are locked in competition at the bottom-end of the laptop market too. AMD scored the contract to supply chips for One Laptop Per Child's "$100 laptop" after which Intel introduced its own machine for emerging markets, the Classmate PC. / 1000 max characters Sony Adds Two Compact Laptop Lines Palm Introduces Foleo &#039;Mobile Companion&#039; Entry-Level Toshiba Laptop Gets AMD Chip OLPC Seeks Educational Games for XO Laptop Dell Ships Ubuntu Linux PCs Vista on a Laptop, Part 3 Google to Buy Panoramio Google is acquiring Panoramio, a photo sharing site that lets user upload photos and identify where they were taken.

Toshiba is no longer an Intel-only shop. The Japanese computing giant says it will buy microprocessors and graphic chipsets from Advanced Micro Devices to power about one-fifth of the business and consumer laptops it sells in the US and Europe. Toshiba, which ranks fourth in the global PC market, expects to save at least 10% in parts-procurement costs by buying the chips from AMD, confirmed a Toshiba US spokesperson. As such, its AMD-powered notebooks, which are slated for release in July, will retail for as much as $82 less than their Intel-powered counterparts, said the Toshiba spokesperson. A spokesperson for AMD in the US declined to comment on pricing or other terms of the deal. Those will be mid- to high end-range notebooks powered by AMD Turion 64 dual-core microprocessors, said the AMD spokesperson. Turion 64 dual-cores are the top-end of AMD's mobile processor range. They come in various models ranging from 1.8GHz to 2.3GHz. Toshiba also will buy AMD M690 series graphics chipsets, which AMD acquired when it bought ATI Technologies AMD declined to comment on whether its antitrust lawsuit against Intel had any bearing whatsoever on Toshiba's move to buy its chips. "We are just very pleased to have Toshiba come on board as customer," said the AMD spokesperson. "Comment beyond that need to be answered by Toshiba." Toshiba did not discuss the lawsuit in relation to the deal. Among its allegations in its original complaint against Intel, filed in June 2005, was that Intel used illegal methods to exclude AMD from the global notebook market. AMD alleges Intel coerced Toshiba and others to buy only Intel chips. "[Intel's] exclusive deals with Dell, Sony and Toshiba alone bar AMD from a third of the world market and half of US domestic sales," said AMD, in its complaint. Dell has since struck a deal to buy AMD chips, breaking a more than two decade-long practice to use only Intel microprocessors. In its 2005 lawsuit, AMD alleged Toshiba, like Sony, was once a "significant AMD customer but, but also like Sony, Toshiba received a very substantial payment from Intel in 2001 not to use AMD processors. Toshiba thereupon dropped AMD." What's more, alleges AMD's complaint, Toshiba execs agreed that Intel's financial inducements amounted to "cocaine," but said they were hooked because reengaging with AMD would jeopardize Intel market development funds worth between $25m and $30m per quarter. "Toshiba made clear to AMD that the tens of millions of dollars of additional marketing support was provided on the explicit condition that Toshiba could not use AMD microprocessors," read AMD's complaint. AMD's legal action against Intel aside, this deal may not be as good for AMD as it first seems. If Toshiba can save as much as 10% on parts-procurement by using AMD chips then it seemingly follows that AMD is selling its wares at a cut-rate price compared to Intel. Because the companies won't discuss pricing terms, it is impossible to say for sure. But if AMD is selling its highest-end notebook chips at a bargain price then the company isn't living up to its promise to compete with Intel on features and not just price. Of course, competing on price is a sound strategy, but against its much larger rival it's a strategy that may not serve AMD in the long run.

Most of the 90-minute interview was spent talking about the "good old days" in Silicon Valley and vague prognostications on the future. That, and a game of reciprocative back-patting. Still, there were a few interesting bits of information for amateur Appleologists on the Internet. The conference began with a question about what each had contributed to the computer industry, to which Gates complimented Jobs&#39; taste and sense of aesthetics. At this point, the conversation devolved into Silicon Valley "war story" material about how many "K" this piece of technology had, though Gates got a laugh with his opening comment about not being Fake Steve Jobs. Jobs&#39; first interesting comment came in response to a question about the relationship between Apple and Microsoft in 1997. If the game was a zero-sum game where if Apple wanted to win, Microsoft had to lose, then Apple was going to lose. But Apple didn&rsquo;t have to beat Microsoft. It had to remember what Apple was. At this point, the latest Mac and PC ads came up, and Jobs made a short nonpology. The art of those commercials is not to be mean, but for the guys to like each other. The PC Guy is great... The PC Guy is what makes it all work. Again, Gates was funny, replying that "PC guy&rsquo;s mother loves him." Shortly thereafter, Steve Jobs said that that "Apple views itself as a software company." All the hardware Apple makes, the Mac, the iPod, and soon the iPhone, is nothing more than a "box" to run the software. The is a fascinating insight into the vision of Steve Jobs, and a little disconcerting to me. First, Apple makes most of its money from selling "boxes." More importantly, while that hardware may be nothing special inside, Apple has always striven for unmatched industrial design on the outside. This is not to say that Apple is getting out of the hardware business, though. Jobs put to rest any conspiracy pinhead theory about Apple doing that when talking about personal technology in the next five to ten years. The PC has been very resilient. Its death has been predicted many times. But the Internet came around and invigorated it. And then it plateaued again. And then digital media came around and invigorated it again. And so I think the PC is going to continue to be with us. Finally, there was an item of great interest to those of us who have suffered with .Mac, which apparently must include tech guru Walt Mossberg. In response to a very restrained point about "not developing .Mac" since its inception, Jobs was surprisingly candid. I couldn&#39;t agree more, and we&#39;ll make up for lost time in the near future. One can only hope. Overall, the interview is pretty tame. I strongly recommend this for those wanting to watch Bill and Steve.

Microsoft Unveils 'Surface' Computing -->) chairman and soon-to-retire chief visionary Bill Gates has been touting alternative forms of computer-human interaction for years, such as tablet computing and voice recognition. On Wednesday, the company said it will deliver on that promise by the end of the year with a device that presents information using an intuitive touch-screen interface based on a display embedded in a table top. The announcement, made by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, came at The Wall Street Journal 's "D: All Things Digital" conference being held this week in Carlsbad, Calif. Dubbed Microsoft Surface, the computer and its interface is the result of six years of collaboration between the company's hardware and Microsoft Research (MSR) divisions. But far from being a research project never meant to see the light of day, the company announced four launch customers for the product. That doesn't mean you can look for them at your neighborhood computer store any time soon. Right now, at least, the devices are too expensive for the average household. While Microsoft would not reveal the actual cost to customers, they will likely range from about $5,000 to $10,000 each, a Microsoft spokesperson told Instead, Microsoft intends to sell the first versions to commercial enterprises. Indeed, Microsoft executives see markets for Surface in hundreds of thousands of restaurants, hotels and retail locations. Ballmer announced that Surface's launch customers are Harrah's Entertainment, which is looking to initially install them as virtual concierge kiosks in its seven Las Vegas casinos. Similarly, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide will launch Surface at Sheraton hotels and resorts in its lobbies, including the ability to browse for music and download books with the use of a credit card. International Game Technology will create gaming devices and systems via a development and distribution agreement with Microsoft &#150; video poker on steroids anyone? Finally, T-Mobile USA, owned by Deutsche Telekom AG, announced it is looking to use Surface devices as in-store kiosks where customers could compare phones and wireless plans simply by placing them side-by-side on the table top. "Surface is one example of how we're turning our stores into a playground where customers can comfortably explore exciting new products in their own personal way," Bonita Inza, vice president of retail at T-Mobile USA, said in a Microsoft statement. No Mouse, No Keyboard First begun as a joint project between MSR researchers and Microsoft's hardware group in 2001, it has evolved into a commercial product that some analysts say is viable &#150; even innovative. Surface features a 30-inch diagonal square display built into a table configuration. It consists of a computer running a customized version of Windows Vista, a rear projection screen and five cameras that look through the screen to recognize and read items placed on the surface, as well as to track hand gestures and touch. It has wired 10/100Mbit Ethernet and wireless 802.11 b/g and Bluetooth 2.0 support built in. It supports multiple touch points &#150; Microsoft says "dozens and dozens" -- as well as multiple users simultaneously, so more than one person could be using it at once, or one person could be doing multiple tasks. The term "surface" describes how it's used. There is no keyboard or mouse. All interactions with the computer are done via touching the surface of the computer's screen with hands or brushes, or via wireless interaction with devices such as smartphones, digital cameras or Microsoft's Zune music player. Because of the cameras, the device can also recognize physical objects; for instance credit cards or hotel "loyalty" cards. This ability to actually deal with physical objects is one of Surface's unique capabilities. The idea, said Microsoft, is to bridge the physical and virtual worlds. "It's very intuitive to use &#91;and&#93; it's not like anything else out there," Matt Rosoff, analyst for consumer strategy and corporate affairs at industry newsletter Directions on Microsoft, told . "It's a new category &#91;and&#93; I think it's very innovative." Want to move digital pictures around on the tabletop? Use your finger to push them around so you can see them better. Need to resize a favorite shot? Grab two opposite corners with your fingers and drag them apart to enlarge it. For instance, a user could set a digital camera down on the tabletop and wirelessly transfer pictures into folders on Surface's hard drive. Or setting a music player down would let a user drag songs from his or her home music collection directly into the player, or between two players, using a finger &#150; or transfer mapping information for the location of a restaurant where you just made reservations through a Surface tabletop over to a smartphone just before you walk out the door. Plan a day out. And whereas Microsoft usually doesn't build hardware to sell &#150; like tablet PCs or mobile phones &#150; this time the company smells money. "We see this as a multi billion dollar category, and we envision a time when surface computing technologies will be pervasive, from tabletops and counters to the hallway mirror," Microsoft CEO Ballmer said in a statement. When will all this transpire? Surface will begin surfacing at its four partners&#146; locations by the end of the year, Microsoft says. Microsoft executives also see broader applications for surface computing, including in schools, businesses and homes and in several form factors, such as built into refrigerators, walls, or counter tops. And make no mistake, Microsoft intends to sell a lot of Surface devices into consumer householders a few years down the line &#150; hopefully, in three to five years, the spokesperson said. "It's what Windows Media Center &#91;Edition&#93; probably should have been," Rob Enderle, principal analyst at research firm Enderle Group told . "Even though it's not initially slated for your living room, it would fit well there once the price comes down." Gates and Apple ( -->) CEO Steve Jobs were scheduled to share the stage Wednesday evening for an "unrehearsed, unscripted, onstage conversation" with writers Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, according to the event's producers. to your browser search box Look What eBay Stumbled Upon Microsoft Unveils 'Surface' Computing Computer Reseller CDW Sells For $7.3B Shopping Kiosk Brings Online Benefits To The Store BetonSports Pleads Guilty to Racketeering Charges Bill & Steve Act More Friend Than Foe Brocade to Pay The Piper $7M For Backdating Customize Your New Red Hat Fedora Intel Spearheads Memory Group in a 'Flash' Look What eBay Stumbled Upon

By Eric Bailey, Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTO &#8212; They came, they wandered, they went. After a 17-day sojourn in Northern California's inland waterways, two wayward humpback whales that caught the attention of the nation appear to have quietly slipped back into the Pacific Ocean. By late Wednesday, nearly 24 hours after they were last sighted off the Marin County town of Tiburon, the mother and her calf were nowhere to be seen. Most of the experts mounting a rescue operation concluded that the pair had found their way back to their ocean home. A pair of patrol boats from the U.S. Coast Guard and California Department of Fish and Game hunted the waters off the coast for any sign of the pair, while vessels crisscrossing San Francisco Bay were asked to notify authorities of any sighting. Not a tail slap, spout or sky-scratching breach was seen. "They arrived here quietly, and if they've made their way outside the Golden Gate, they've gone out quietly," said Bernadette Fees, a state Fish and Game spokeswoman. First spotted swimming languidly May 13, the pair arrived in the Sacramento River sporting deep gashes likely inflicted by a run-in with a ship. They wandered into a deep-water shipping channel and into the Port of Sacramento, meandering 70 miles from the sea. In the days that followed, whale experts from around the nation descended on the area to lend a hand. The rescue team received thousands of e-mails and calls from the public, expressing concern and offering suggestions. Northern Californians took off workdays to perch on riverbank levees to get a glimpse. Experts faced a tough balance between giving the whales room to relax and heal and trying to persuade them to head back to their natural saline environment, where their wounds would better heal. The rescue team used clanking pipes, recordings of killer whales and even the geyser spray of a fireboat in an unsuccessful bid to prod the whales past what became their biggest obstacle &#8212; a bustling bridge at Rio Vista. Scientists grew worried late last week as the pair's health continued to deteriorate. By the weekend, the team resorted to administering a dose of antibiotics &#8212; a first for whales in the wild &#8212; delivered with foot-long syringes shot from a .22-caliber rifle. They prepared to launch a massive post-Memorial Day push to move the whales. The whales beat them to the punch. On Sunday, they made their break amid the buzz of holiday jet skiers and boaters on the river. Over three days, they moved purposefully down the river, through the narrow Carquinez Strait and into San Francisco Bay. Seeming to gain vigor, the 20-foot-long juvenile put on a display of leaps and tail slaps as if at play. Tara Cahn, a Sausalito architect, jumped in her car upon learning that the whales were swimming along the Marin County coast. After a few wrong turns, she finally tracked them down Tuesday evening about a quarter-mile offshore of Tiburon. "They were bouncing around, they were playing, they were spouting," said Cahn, who on Wednesday was out looking for them again. "I've been whale watching on Monterey Bay, and this was far more exciting." Scientists say the pair's health rebounded after they returned to the bay's soothing saltwater. Their skin, which grew pitted during their trip up the Sacramento River, was looking slick and slippery by Tuesday evening. "We're still holding our breath a little bit, but we're just so pleased," said Trevor Spradlin, a marine mammal biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, the federal agency that helped lead the rescue effort. Spradlin said scientists are coming away with a treasure trove of insights and observations that will fuel months of research. "We will rigorously and systematically document this case. Really, the only other reference point was Humphrey, and that was a long time ago," he said, referring to the wayward humpback that spent nearly a month in the delta in 1985.

Jobs in a rare joint appearance at a technology conference in Carlsbad, Calif. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: Calif., May 30  In a highly anticipated encounter, Bill Gates of Microsoft and Steven P. Jobs of Apple took the stage Wednesday evening to relive old battles and alliances and speculate about the future of digital culture and technology. Rivals for three decades, the two executives have rarely appeared in public together and have generally been viewed as bitter rivals, despite occasional partnerships. In front of about 600 technology executives at the D: All Things Digital conference, which was sponsored by The Wall Street Journal, the two executives attracted the attention usually reserved for rock singers and Hollywood stars. However, attendees who came hoping for fireworks or a confrontation were disappointed. The mild tone to the session did not take anything away from the event and after discussing the past and present of the computing industry, the two were greeted with a standing ovation. After the event was over a number of the attendees who are veterans of decades in the computer industry said the joint appearance was the most memorable moment of any of the many conferences they had attended. Mr. Gates and Mr. Jobs largely pioneered the personal computer industry beginning in 1975 and 1976 and they spent part of the evening sharing memories of those days. Today "we ship these computers with one or two gigabytes and nobody remembers 128 kilobytes," Mr. Jobs said. Apple and Microsoft were business partners at the start of the computer era beginning in 1977 when Mr. Gates supplied a copy of the BASIC programming language for the Apple II computer. Later, Mr. Gates made an early bet on writing software for the Macintosh, two years before the computer was introduced in 1984. Neither was willing to acknowledge the possibility that the personal computer era they helped create would end any time soon. "The PC has proven to be very resilient," Mr. Jobs said. At the same time they called themselves believers in the explosion of hand-held communications devices, also known as "Post PC devices." Mr. Gates said he was sometimes frustrated by the fact that the players in the industry changed so quickly. "I miss it when people come and go. It's nice when people stick around and it gives us some context," he said.During a question and answer period at the end of the session both men were asked to comment on the other's strengths. Mr. Gates singled out Mr. Jobs intuitive aesthetic sense. "I'd give a lot to have Steve's taste," Mr. Gates said, drawing laughter from the audience. "The way he does things, it's just different." Mr. Jobs returned the compliment, noting that Mr. Gates skills at building business partnerships were something that eluded him in his first decade at Apple. Asked to comment on today's computer industry and the youth culture that it markets to, both men pointed to examples of applications of computer technology that had been readily adopted by seniors. Mr. Gates said that when he showed the Microsoft Surface, the touch computing system introduced on Wednesday to a group of chief executives at his home several weeks ago, he was surprised they were more enthusiastic about the product than he was. The executives, he noted came from a generation that was not comfortable with keyboards. They were particularly interested in a technology that allowed them to control things on a display screen by pointing and moving them directly with their fingers. Neither man was willing to say harsh things about the other and Mr. Jobs summed up his feelings by quoting from a Beatles song: "&#61486;'You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead,' that's clearly true here," he said.

Robert Alan Soloway owned Newport Internet Marketing Corporation (NIM) based in Seattle. He will appear before Seattle's district court this afternoon. Soloway is accused, between 2003 and 2007, of offering broadcast email services which sent messages with false headers and were relayed using networks of proxy computers or botnets. Much of this service was fraudulent - including the claim that email addresses on the lists had "opted-in" to receive such offers. Guarantees regarding the products offered were not honoured and refunds refused. Soloway is also accused of constantly moving his websites to make anti-spam measures more difficult. Since last year his websites have been registered with Chinese ISPs to make proving his ownership of domains more difficult. The false headers he put on emails led many people to have their legitimate email addresses or domains blacklisted by anti-spam groups. The US authorities are seeking $772,000, which Soloway made as a result of his nefarious activities. The Federal Trade Commission received hundreds of complaints about Soloway and NIM. His offences could also earn him a $250,000 fine and five years in prison. The full statement is available Post a new comment What punishment would fit the crime?

Brand new Manhunt 2 trailer PSP firmware updated for new PS3 features Thursday 31-May-2007 8:20 AM Version 3.50 goes live, bringing PSP's Remote Play features in line with its bigger brother A new version of the PSP firmware, version 3.50, is now available, updating PSPs Remote Play capabilities. Last week Sony updated the PS3 firmware (version 1.8) to support Remote Play over the internet, meaning you can control your PS3 (with a PSP) from anywhere in the world so long as you have access to wireless internet. But the option to actually do that on the PSP has been absent, until now. Don't get too excited, Remote Play should really be called Remote Look or Remote Listen, because it only allows you to access media (music, pictures, videos) stored on your PS3, not play its games through your PSP. The RSS menu has also been given a small tweak, now boasting an RSS Channel Guide, for the RSS n00bs out there. If you've got wireless internet you can update your PSP directly by going to the Update System option on the XMB. Otherwise you can download it straight from Sony , and transfer the file to your PSP via USB cable.

As an owner of a PS3 and PSP, I'm still not quite sold on their Remote Play feature, where you can access media files stored on your PS3 from your PSP, wherever you are in the world. It's neat in theory, but relies on a.) your PS3 being turned on when you're on a work trip or holiday, and b.) you not having an iPod or other device to hand with your fave albums and music on it. Nevertheless, if you disagree and are foaming at the mouth for Remote Play, you'll be pleased to hear that Sony has just upgraded the PSP's firmware to version 3.50, which updates the device to take advantage of Remote Play over the network. It's about time too â last week the PS3's firmware was upgraded to support the feature, leaving PSP owners waiting for a similar update before they could use it. According to PSPSPS.tv, you now login using your PSN user email address and password, then stream away to your heart's content. To be honest, I'm more excited about the RSS Channel Guide feature for PSP, which should make it easier to browse and sign up for RSS feeds on Sony's device. But then I am a certified nerd.

But the deal also could bring Apple into the middle of a rancorous copyright battle over television shown on the Web. MTV Networks owner Viacom Inc. (VIAb.N: , which is suing YouTube for copyright violation, said it would welcome the chance to license material to Apple. "We're always vigilant about protecting our copyrights. But we would welcome the opportunity to license our content to Apple as we do with all distributors," a Viacom spokesman said. Viacom sued YouTube in March for $1 billion (506 million pounds) charging it with "massive intentional copyright infringement" after finding hundreds of thousands of Viacom-owned videos uploaded to the service without its permission. Apple TV will stream videos wirelessly from the Internet on YouTube, starting in mid-June, the company said. Thousands of the most current and popular YouTube videos will be available then, it said, and the full catalogue will be available in the fall. Apple TV works with iTunes to play users' content -- video, movies, television shows and the like -- wirelessly on a wide-screen television. Apple also on Wednesday launched iTunes Plus, a music download service that has no copy-protection software limiting consumers' use of the songs. It features artists with EMI Group, including Coldplay, The Rolling Stones and Joss stone. Jobs has called on the music industry to allow online retailers like iTunes to sell digital songs without restrictions to give the digital music sector a boost and give consumers what they want. &copy; Reuters 2007.

With the new "Street View" feature in Google Maps, users will be able to view and navigate with a 360-degree view of the selected cities, including San Francisco area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver and Miami. While introducing the Street View at the O'Reilly Where 2.0 Conference 2007 in San Jose, Google claimed that the new feature places Google Map users at the road level, offering them a deeper and more detailed experience of the location than aerial images provide. "With Street View users can virtually walk the streets of a city, check out a restaurant before arriving, and even zoom in on bus stops and street signs to make travel plans," said John Hanke, director of Google Earth and Maps. Initially pitched for selected cities, the street level imagery will soon be available for other metropolitan regions, Google said in a statement. Early last month, the Mountain View, California based online advertising and internet search giant launched âMy Mapsâ, another Google Map service that lets users to create customized maps with specific locations and picture. According to Google, this new mapping tool that can be found in a tab on the left side of the map interface allows users create their own maps to destinations, throwing in their own text, photos and videos for others to see. It even enables non-technical users easily annotate and share maps. Googleâs street-level viewing features are not new as Amazon.com Inc.âs A9.com already has showed street-level views of roughly two dozen major U.S. cities through its BlockView mapping service, which was launched in early 2005. However, it discontinued the feature last year in September. Google on Tuesday also announced the launch of a tool for independent software developers to build mini-applications that can be displayed within Google Maps. Called Mapplets, these gadget applications can display a range of information, from housing listings to crime data. Mapplets will be available in the Maps site for users to choose from and apply to their maps. Mapplets, which currently is in preview mode, can be found in a special version of Google Maps for users who want to try them out. The same day, Microsoft has announced that its Microsoft Live Search Maps service will expand to include more cities worldwide by the end of summer. The world's leading software-producing company last year in November announced the launch of its new mapping service, 'Virtual Earth 3-D' to further add to the services being offered on its Live Search. Microsoft initially included three-dimensional tours of 15 US cities, including San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Detroit, Phoenix, Houston, Baltimore, Atlanta, Denver, Dallas and Fort Worth. Now, Microsoft has enhanced its Live Search Map service by adding 3D cityscapes of U.S. cities Austin, Texas; Cape Coral, Florida; Cincinnati; Indianapolis; Savannah, Georgia; and Tampa, Florida. Northampton, England, and Ottawa, Canada, also will be featured as 3D cityscapes via this service. The 3-D feature lets users zoom in and out of these urban areas and get a three-dimensional view of buildings, terrain, and the like. Until now, the earth was flat for us, but websites such as Google Earth have given us a bird's eye view of the world. Googleâs popular Earth software allows a third of the worldâs population obtain aerial views of their homes and neighborhoods. The largest search engine on the Web, Google has distributed more than 100 million free copies of Earth since June 2005. Google Maps software is tied to search engine giant's online service and informs users about traffic conditions in 30 U.S. cities, provides driving directions, movable/scalable maps, and local search results for business locations as well as satellite and aerial views. Google Maps is currently the third-most popular map site after Time Warner Inc.'s AOL online businessâs Mapquest and Yahoo Maps, which already offer similar function.

Even Mozilla seemed unsure of their impact. "Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code," the advisory read. Mozilla warned Thunderbird and SeaMonkey that their e-mail software, which shares Firefox's layout engine, may be vulnerable to these bugs as well. The developers recommend that users do not enable JavaScript in Thunderbird or the mail portion of SeaMonkey. The updates also fix a pop-up bug that could be used to mask parts of the browser, such as the address bar; a cross-site scripting vulnerability; a problem with how the browsers handle cookies; and a flaw that could let attackers crash Firefox using its autocomplete feature. can be downloaded from the Mozilla Web site for Windows, , meanwhile, is available from a different page.

Page (1) of 1 - 05/27/07 Teachings of the Wii Generation I want you all to consider what I am about to suggest to you. You people seem to want what we've got. Well, we have room for you. We have room for you and about 30 of your friends. You would be students of course, but you'd also be teachers. Walter (Brian Dennehy)  Cocoon (1985) How do you win in the PC/CE industry? Every engineerevery marketing expert knows the answer. You give em more. More features. More fun. More quality. More bells. More whistles. You give em less. Thats the way the gaming industry does it and conventional wisdom (dont you love that Microsoft MS Word 2002 CD - oem ?) proves it works. After all, everyone knows gamers are 14-24 year old guys who: - love the smell of napalm in the morning and squealing tires - want their women overly endowed and ready for action - like their mechanical and alien competitors big, ugly and without conscience - can sit in their dank rooms 4-8 hours straight without bathing or relieving themselves If any of the other 6+ billion people on the planet buy into the gaming buzz fine. Figure 1 - Global Population Today there are over 6.6 billion people on the planet. All are potential customers for something. All those of us in the industry need to do is figure out what it isboy that was simple! Source  U.S. Census Bureau They dont really count though. You may think of this stuff as simplygames. To the hardware/software folks involvedits serious stuff! Right now the market is on track to become a $50+ billion global business. Even by MS standards thats not chump change! Figure 2 - No Game  Those of us who play them just think of gaming systems as idle time games. But to the hardware, software and subscription service people who make their living in this space it is serious business. Source  Informa Telecoms & Media Ok so its bighuge even. So how would you have like to have been the guys who bounded into Iwata-sans (now president) and Yamauchi-sans (founder and CEO until 2002) offices and said you wanted to develop game systems that wouldnt compete with Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank s PS or Microsofts Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank They want to develop this people-oriented system that anyone could buy and play. They wanted it kid and adult friendly. They wanted to call it something that was part of the family. Just for Fun  The Nintendo swam in the face of convention. It isnt tough to learn, tough to play or tough on the plot. It is just fun to play and easy to learn/master. It has attracted young and old, male and female to the dismay/consternation of Microsoft and Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank . Source  Nintendo Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank were pushing the fast track, Nintendo took the road less traveled. Game reviewers fought each other to write the most glowing coverage possible for the powerhouse Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank , MS systems. Words flowed in adrenalin fashion over the systems and the games. Reviewers flipped coins to see who would review the Nintendo . The losers got stuck with the job. But something went awry in the brilliant MS/ Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank planning and reviewer accolades. Every 10 or 11,000 years I make a horrible mistake. Time to step back and look how and why Nintendo tapped a market that logic (dont you love that Microsoft MS Word 2002 CD - oem ?) says wasnt there. Its a shift in the post-modern world that can help the entire PC/CE. The signs were therewe just didnt pay any attention. The Internet and gaming isnt a 20+ stud domain! - 18-49 gamers are only 44% of the market. 56% is other Figure 3 - Not All 20-Something  Turns out that not everyone who is a potential game system/software customer is 18-24 and male. They are younger and older and alsofemale. Source  Ipsos Insights - nearly 52% of the internet users are female Figure 4 - Female Domination  While men tend to think that men dominate the Internet  and by that definition also gaming  but it turns out women are on the iNet in greater numbersover 51% are female. Source  eMarketer - 54% of the online game players are female - 66% of females watch videos online - 75%+ of the online gamers are women - Women are different from men (surprise!) - Older & younger players like to interact with others Faith Popcorn, president of BrainReserve, identified two concepts  clicking (pinpointing lifestyle trends) and cocooning (retreating into the home and doing things as a family) years ago. She identified females and families as a dominant force  for long term sales  in the market. Sometimes referred to as the Nostradamus of marketing, her work and predictions rang true for Nintendo and software/online subscription services have gotten the message. Maybe the rest of the industry will follow suit! The worlds demographics are in an important transition: - Nearly 1/5th of Japanese and Italians are 65+and its increasing. The US with 12% age 65 or older ranks 15th in this category - Aging is proceeding rapidly. Japan doubled its percentage in 26 years and the acceleration is even grater in Brazil, Singapore and Thailand - 60% of the women 75+ are widows in Australia, Malaysia, Croatia - Older Canadian women living alone increased 8x between 1961  2001 - By 2050 nearly 1.5 billion will be 65+ and an almost equal number will be 0-14 The big guns in gaming  Microsoft, Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank , and Nintendo  are following different paths. Come on face it. Gaming is a sideline to MS and Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank . Their agendas arent really to give you heart pounding, sweaty palm game action! They want their systems as your home entertainment hubs. If you happen to play a game now and thengreat. But they are adding the features, capabilities and connections you need around the house. Complex stuff they know you need. - Connection to your TV - Connection to your stereo - Connection to your refrigerator, stove - PC things (remember MS wants to rule your world!) They want you to have fun! Theyve got stuff that: - is multiplayer, community focused - is of interest to the casual gamer (the majority of us) - gets you off your fat *** and lets you participate with more than your fingers - makes it fun on a casual, communal, friendly level So what has that got to do with the rest of the industry? In our converged/converging world people want personal communications. Personal solutions. Personal devices. While manufacturers keep adding valueadding capabilitiesadding featuresadding complexityadding cost. Its an unsavory set of design compromises. Theyre compromises that techies love. SONY PlayStation Portable (PSP) is a pretty good game system. Its good for watching movies (lot better screen size than your iddy bitty Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank It can store/play your music. Game On  It just isnt right! Nintendos DS should not be outselling Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank SONY PlayStation Portable (PSP) . After all the SONY PlayStation Portable (PSP) has superior graphics, movie playing capability, music playing capability, sweaty palm gaming. Nintendo DS Lite Coral Pink ? Just fun. Fun for young and old alike. Maybe simple is better? Source  Nintendo Of course people are hacking it to do all sorts of things beyond that but heythats what hackers do!!! Its a product that is outstripping the SONY PlayStation Portable (PSP) Its a product that could have legs even into 2011 in the U.S. when there will be 59 million kids (0-14) and boomers + of over 90 million. Figure 6 - Tapping The Market  Whether they knew it or it was just dumb luck, Nintendo built systems  and DS  for the marketplace. The older and younger population as well as females and family folks have flocked to the systems and software. So much so that other software developers are suddenly warming up to Nintendo. What can you learn from this shift? Source  U.S. Census Bureau The rest of the population? Well as Walter/Dennehy said I promise you, you will all lead productive lives. Seems to us that Iwata-san was a brain surgeon and Yamauachi-san was a rocket scientist. The guys who suggested the and DS were more than just snake oil sales people. The Nintendo approach so far has shown that the Swiss-army PC/CE solution may get a techies pulse racing but doesnt get everyone into the pool. Consumers  around the globe  want personal products and solutions that they can easily optimize for specific applications, specific activities. Certainly we could be wrong. Or as Ben Luckett said in Cocoon, Well there is the one school of thought that says they don't know nothing. Its time that PC/CE companies takes a closer look at the Nintendo phenomenon and implements those lessons that apply for their firm. After all the lowest common denominator must know something. There are so many of them andtheir numbers are increasing !! has spent more than 15 years in the optical storage, software and video industry, indulging in, among other things, marketing activities in promoting MO, CD, DVD technology and its applications.

Fast-forward to today, and all three of the hardware manufacturers are looking a wee bit foolish. Each has a chance to win this thing â possibly for good â but all they can do is make mistakes and missteps. First, let me tell you about two years ago. Sony kicked things off with a Monday afternoon press conference, despite the fact that E3 actually would only open on Wednesday. Apparently Sonyâs marketing team was convinced that the press would take the time to arrive in LA early just to hear about the PlayStation 3. They were right of course, but then they all they could do was shown canned demos of rubber ducks, and tell us why the PS3 would be a great system when it would arrive in the spring of 2006 (for the record it was late). The message from Sony was that they would always be number one, and the other companies might not even bother. Things were much different that Monday night at Microsoft. The Redmond software giant had traditionally held a Monday night press conference to beat Sony to the punch, but when Sony moved their press conference to Monday afternoon to scoop Microsoft things got interesting. Microsoft âintroducedâ the Xbox 360 a week in advance on MTV, making the whole press conference old news. Then at the press event &mdash; which ran more than an hour late &mdash; featured hired fans on stage to convince the media that this would be the system to back. Hype does not equal buzz, but someone forgot that rule. And finally there was poor Nintendo. The company once again lacked enough chairs for the millions of people that showed up for their press conference &mdash; OK, maybe it only felt like millions. Then Nintendo proceeded once again to ignore technological advances that gamers seemed (at least at the time) to be clamoring to have in their systems. With this yearâs E3 just over a month and a half away, these same companies seem to be continually dropping the ball. At this point it is way too early to even guess who will be out in top when the dust settles, so feel free to post your opinions. But hereâs a quick run down of why these companies are their own worst enemies. The house that Mario built promised in 2005 not to be last to market. Yeah, while we heard that before, and will probably hear it again. Being last to the market is fine, but donât make promises you canât keep. Instead make systems! And get those systems on store shelves. In fairness, Nintendo did a great job of delivering plenty of Wii systems for launch day. But in the months since that brisk November launch systems have been harder to find than Lindsay Lohan on a movie set. Also in fairness, Ms. Lohan will eventually turn up, possibly even sober, but the Wii might be seen on store shelves in mass qualities until 2009! What is up with this supply chain problem? Didnât the executives expect this type of demand, or were they having doubts as the launched date approached? The company finally has a runaway hit and theyâre blowing it (sorry no Lohan comparison here). By the time the supply issues are resolved the rival systems may actually begin to fall in price, and killer app titles will push sales of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Now is the time for Nintendo to be making sales. Their system is arguably the âotherâ console that gamers may buy while waiting for a price cut, or something really worth playing on the PS3 or 360. And this is a problem the company had to have seen coming? By the time more Wii consoles arrive, it maybe too little, too late. Nintendo has always failed to gage the competition ever since they abandoned the CD-ROM add-on for the SNES, which you know went on to become the Sony PlayStation. This might be the one area where Nintendoâs blinders are working to their advantage. People are buying the Wii to play simple games that take advantage of their silly controller. So before this thing goes on life support already, get more games stat! What weâre hoping to see at E3: styled games. The Wii needs more of these to succeed. Skip the Red Steel type shooters. And Mario might help too, and yeah, heâs a fan favorite. But to get that true mass you need games that everyone really knowsâ¦ and thatâs more bowling, pool and simple stuff. Having won the last two hardware rounds, Sony was on top of the world and ruling all it surveyed. Then a strange thing happenedâ¦ a knight saw another crusade. The knight is Sir Howard Stringer, and as head honcho at Sony heâs betting on Blu-ray. This meant that the Sony PlayStation 3 was delayed while the next generation video format was sorted out last spring. And it puts the PS3 on two frontlines. One is the console war, where the system is going up against the Xbox 360 and the Wii, while it is also going up against the HD-DVD optical disc format in another showdown. Entering the latter fray could be a lose-lose situation. Movie studios are already looking at digital downloads and other means of delivery for HD content, so whichever format âwinsâ wonât be ruling for long anyway. Worse for the consumer, adding the Blu-ray drive has meant that the PS3 carries the hefty $599 price point. Yet at the same time this undercuts other stand alone Blu-ray players. Sony has had trouble get enough systems on the shelves anyway, and as result developers are beginning to pull support. All this would be fine, as the game is early, but Sony then confused matters by pulling the $499 version from the market, releasing a model with a larger hard drive in some markets and hinting at the same model in the U.S. Confused? Youâre not the only one. Sony can take credit for outselling the Xbox 360 in April however. But not with the PS3â¦ no, that would be the PlayStation 2. Sony, unlike Nintendo or Microsoft, doesnât want to pull support on their older system. On the one hand why should they, theyâre still racking in money on it. The system is still selling, and they make a lot of money on third-party game titles. But having that system out there is no doubt convincing many gamers to wait for the PS3. This would actually be a bigger problem with a rival system was on the horizon, but without another rival console for a while (we hope anyway), Sony should be in the clear. Still no sale today doesnât help ensure victory tomorrow. What weâre hoping to see at E3: Sony likes to show off big games such as Resistance: Fall of Man . But Nintendo is on to something with easy to play mass-appeal games. A good family game would be great. And a word of advice to Sony: âleave them wanting more.â An epic press conference where you show us everything isnât what we want to see either. First out of the gate in 2005. Microsoft got the early launch, and what did it get them? is still months away, and developers are having trouble with the system. Plus, unlike Sony, Microsoft abandoned their original console. This increased demand for the Xbox 360, but left a lot of gamers in the dark. Microsoft was desperate in 2005, and now that desperation has the company making some strange decisions. The biggest mistake is that they listened to the demands big box retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Target, and released two versions of their console. Sony would go on to make the same mistake too. This confused consumers and meant that some gamers have a 360 system without a hard drive. OK, Microsoft was innovative with the Xbox, but went backward with the Xbox 360 by making the hard drive optional. This has caused headaches for game developers, notably for titles such as the upcoming Grand Theft Auto IV The first thing to do is make a hard drive only game. This will make game development easier, and convince those without one to get with the program. Plus, Microsoft can over charge for the hard drive as another revenue stream. Will gamers complain? Only the few without the hard drive model, and theyâll stop complaining once they realize the benefits. But the second thing Microsoft needs to do is to stop coming up with other hardware upgrades to the system. The HD-DVD drive add-on is nice, but it doesnât function as well as a standalone HD-DVD player, and if Hollywood goes all out on requiring HDMI connections for HD movie playback, then the first generation of 360s will be screwed. And that brings us to the next pointâ¦ if you want to add features such as HDMI do so without re-releasing the system. I know this is a contradiction to what I just said, but this type of hardware upgrade that should upgrade all the systems, and not just be a special edition version. There are some necessary upgrades, but coming up with too many add-ons just screams, âwe forgot to put this in.â . If your executives are going to get a tattoo on their arms (shout out to Peter Moore), then the game should be exclusive. If Ken over at Sony can get the same tattooâ¦ or for that matter say, âI donât need a tattoo to tell you that is coming to the PS3â then donât do it! What weâre hoping to see at E3: Proof that Games for Windows isnât just a back-up plan in case you decide to exit the console hardware arena. Games for Windows is a valid brand, but donât treat it like it is brand new either. I know this was a rant about consoles, and the idea of cross-platform play is incredible actually. However, the PC still gets the shaft when it comes to games (those stupid Mac commercials come to mind). And hand-me-down games such as for Vista arenât convincing us of the power of the system , on the console side what else is coming besides ? What about some of the other franchises such as ? Are we going to see these games ever show up for the 360? We also know Microsoft tried mass appeal with . So enough said on that front. Finally, to all three console companies: Youâve done a great job of keeping our interest up. Wars are bad things, and this includes the console wars. Maybe one of these three systems should go away in the future. Freedom of choice is a great thing, but with three companies it seems that youâre confusing the developers. Let them put all their attention on two console platforms (and Iâm not even thinking of all the handhelds, the PC, etc.). But if there must be three, letâs not see another new console until 2015. By then Iâll be too old to care. This entry was posted on Wednesday, May 30th, 2007 at 10:26 am and is filed under . You can follow comments to this entry through the feed.

Read 1605 times May 30th, 2007 at 11:34 am silly controller? i think not. the controller is state of the art and even the PS3 tried to incorporate it in an unsuccessful way. the reason for the shortages? My theory is that Nintendo is focusing on keeping their loyal owners of a wii, happy. My Wii was defective and I called up the support line and they didn&#8217;t give me any sort of a hard time. They said that they will ship it and when I receive it in 2-3 days, to juts place the defective unit in the same box. place the sticker that was included inside the box on the outside and free shipping was included. I had my new unit in less than 2 days. If they were focusing on just getting units into stores and in turn neglect their already base of customers, i believe that this article above would be focusing on Nintendo&#8217;s lack of support. So basically its a loose loose scenario when it comes to critical perspectives like yourselves to try and just hype hit-counts for your website. Wii is a great system. If you by chance get that 1percent with a defect, rest assured that Nintendo is keeping some replacements at base for you. I think Nintendo is doing the right thing by keeping their existing customers happy. Because in the future console wars, that phone call to customer service could make or break a future purchase for Nintendo. May 30th, 2007 at 3:36 pm &#8220;Sony can take credit for leading sales in April however.&#8221; ???????? as you can see Nintendo is number 1 in hardware and software sales Hardware Sales for April 2007 1.

O'Reilly Where 2.0 Conference 2007 in San Jose, Google debuted Street View, a feature that it said gives Google Maps users the perspective of drivers and pedestrians in a city. That offers a deeper and more detailed view of locations than aerial images provide, Google claimed. The search engine market leader initially is providing Street View imagery in its maps of New York, Las Vegas, Miami, Denver and the San Francisco Bay Area. It said that more cities will be added "in the near future." has been at the forefront of immersive online maps, having introduced in late 2005 so-called bird's-eye views that enabled users to tilt aerial images and view them from different angles. Last November, Microsoft began making 3-D views of cities available in its Windows Live Search Maps software, a feature that lets users zoom in and out of urban areas and get what Microsoft describes as photorealistic views of buildings and other landmarks. On Tuesday, the software vendor of cities for which it offers 3-D views, adding New York and eight other locations. Meanwhile, Google said its new Mapplets technology supports the development of lightweight applications for Google Maps, similar to the way that can be used with the company's iGoogle personalized home page. From a technical standpoint, Mapplets are Gadgets that can be coded to manipulate maps using Javascript calls derived from the application programming interface for Google Maps, according to the company. Previously, developers could build an application on top of Google Maps and make it available on a specific Web site. Now, Google said, developers and end users alike can package multiple Mapplets on a single map to create mashups of the "mini applications" supported by the new technology. Mapplets are currently supported on a developer's of Google Maps for users who want to try them out.

O'Brien explains how Nintendo's new game machine won over the world - and beat the pants off Sony and Microsoft. , Fortune senior editor May 31 2007: 12:02 PM EDT (Fortune Magazine) -- Nintendo's legendary videogame designer Shigeru Miyamoto is lying face down on the floor in Kyoto, Japan, hobbled by a right cross and struggling to regain his composure. The man some credit with the very existence of the $30 billion videogame industry, the Walt Disney of our generation, has taken one blow to the face too many. I'm standing over the creative force behind Donkey Kong, Super Mario, Nintendogs and his latest worldwide sensation, the Wii. I goad him to get up for the rest of his beating. Clearly, one of us is taking our boxing match a bit too seriously. After all, it's not really Miyamoto who has crumbled but rather his avatar - his Mii, in Nintendo parlance. "Ohhh" is about all the man can muster as the clock runs out. Miyamoto puts down his controller and concedes defeat to finish a photo shoot. Nintendo's Miyamoto (left) "boxes" author O'Brien. Iwata holding a DS handheld device, his other big hit. Wii will rock you The next big Silicon Valley IPO Lerach to abdicate his throne Get a look inside the Wiimote Four ways to buy a Wii Go to a store and wait in line. Wii deliveries at electronics and toy stores are sporadic, and the inventory is never guaranteed. The big chains we spoke to advised coming on a weekend morning before the doors open. Persistence pays off; $250 plus local sales tax. Buy one on eBay. They're going for $315 or so, not including shipping. Wait time: two to three days. Buy it used. Used units are sold by private sellers, but they're selling above list price. Expect to pay up to $600, shipping not included. Amazon has new ones too, and they're selling at list with free shipping ... but of course you'll have to wait. At the time of publication the site said only three were available, but more were expected by the end of the month. If price truly is no object, then instruct the pilot of your private jet to land somewhere near Cape Girardeau, Mo. ... As of presstime the Toys "R" Us there still had six, and they'd been sitting on the shelf for two weeks. That'll run you $250 plus the cost of jet fuel. Or roundtrip airfare and car rental for the two-hour drive from St. Louis. 118 years of playing around Nintendo founded in Kyoto as playing-card company. Becomes first company to produce Western-style playing cards in Japan. Strikes a deal with Disney to feature its characters on Nintendo playing cards. Nintendo goes public on the Osaka and Kyoto exchanges. Briefly goes conglomerate: starts selling instant rice and opens a taxi company and a chain of by-the-hour "love hotels." None of it sticks, not even the rice. Develops the coin-operated Donkey Kong arcade game, the company's first international success. Nintendo Entertainment System launches, which introduces Super Mario Brothers and an infrared-gun peripheral for use in Duck Hunt. Game Boy, the world's first portable handheld videogame with interchangeable game cartridges, is introduced. Nintendo 64, the world's first 64-bit home videogame system, premieres. Nintendo GameCube debuts. Mediocre sales. Nintendo DS, handheld that allows wireless multi-user play. Big hit with girls, older folks, and other nontraditional gamers. Wii unveiled in the U.S. With 2.5 million consoles selling in the first six months, it handily beats Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation3. I may have beaten him at his own game, but we both know who's the real winner here. Nintendo's newest contraption has performed exactly as designed, creating yet another Wiivangelist, this time a gloating gaijin 5,000 miles from home who not only got up off the couch to play a videogame but actually worked up a sweat. With this little victory Miyamoto and company gather more momentum in their quest to conquer worthier competition. Videogame controllers generally feature a bewildering array of buttons, and watching an avid gamer work the device, thumbs pattering across plastic, can be intimidating. By contrast the Wii's wireless, motion-sensitive remote, which Miyamoto had been dreaming of for years, often requires no button manipulation whatsoever. In the boxing game my 54-year-old host and I were bobbing and weaving and punching at air - jabs and crosses mostly. Miyamoto, whose official title is senior managing director, would angle his hands from one side to another to avoid haymakers; each time I missed, he'd giggle. And everyone in the room laughed along. While game consoles typically attract youngish males with an antisocial streak, the Wii is bringing people of all demographics together: in nursing homes, for Wii bowling leagues, on cruise ships, at coed (!) Wii-themed parties and, of course, in lines - as hordes of consumers clamor to buy the impossible-to-find $250 machine. Nintendo is churning out over a million units a month and still can't meet demand. How the Wii is creaming the competition At the Nintendo World store in New York City's Rockefeller Center, shipments arrive nightly. In the wee hours customers begin lining up around the block. Doors open at nine, and a few hours later the consoles are gone. In the world's gadget epicenter, Tokyo's Akihabara district, shopkeepers complain about the lack of inventory. Wii displays are covered with SOLD OUT signs, while piles of PlayStation3 boxes carry a different message: 5 percent OFF. Even the Nintendo of America company store near Seattle sees lines of employees, visitors and contractors. Forget about lucking into a Wii at your local It's not unusual for a new game console to sell out during its pre-Christmas introduction, only to see sales dwindle come January. But six months after the Wii's launch, sales are accelerating. Nintendo sold 360,000 boxes in the U.S. in April, 100,000 more than in March. That's two Wiis for every Xbox 360 and four for every PlayStation3. ) lose money on hardware in hopes of seeding the market with their consoles, analysts say Nintendo makes about $50 on every unit. It may not sound like much, but the company plans to sell 35 million of these things over the next few years. That's $1.75 billion in potential profit. Add that to the ridiculous earnings from the company's handheld gaming device, the Nintendo DS, as well as software sales and licensing revenue, and you begin to understand why Nintendo's market cap just passed $45 billion, an all-time high. ( ) trades on the Tokyo and Kyoto stock exchanges and as an ADR in the U.S.) More difficult to comprehend is how a company founded 118 years ago as a maker of playing cards in Kyoto came to be pummeling Microsoft and Sony. The answer has something to do with reinvention. From industry-changing arcade machines to handhelds, 3-D graphics to immersive game play, Nintendo has shown a knack for leapfrogging its industry. Sure, some initiatives failed - a toy vacuum cleaner, a taxi service, a chain of "love hotels" - but the company rarely fails to surprise. And if the Wii shortage demonstrates anything, it's that this time, in changing perceptions of gaming, Nintendo has surprised even itself. In a quieter moment Miyamoto ponders that ability to chart a new course. "How Nintendo has been able to create one surprise after another is a big question even for me," he says. "I'd like to know the answer." The word "Nintendo" is an amalgamation of three symbols: nin, meaning "leave to"; ten, for "heaven"; and do, "company." The most common translation in Kyoto is "the company that leaves to heaven." What that means is open to debate. It could be a resignation to fate, as in "The company's destiny is in heaven's hands." But it's clear from a series of exclusive interviews with several executives over three months in Japan and the U.S. that little is left to chance. Another translation might be "Take care of every detail, and heaven will take care of the rest." The man who oversees every detail is president and CEO Satoru Iwata. Iwata, 47, started as a developer for a firm Nintendo bought in 2000. Since taking over in 2002 he has westernized Nintendo, instituting performance-based raises and a retirement age of 65. To hear suppliers and contractors talk, working with Nintendo is both frustrating and inspirational. It can be Wal-Mart-esque, driving down prices by playing parts manufacturers against one another while challenging them to be more creative. Employees talk breathlessly about loving their jobs while grumbling about hectic schedules. Everyone flies commercial. The one person permitted in first class, Iwata himself, has been known to slog to London and back in one day for a press conference. No hotel required. In short, Iwata has made Nintendo as efficient as a bullet train and as stingy as a bento box. The company's 3,400 employees generated $8.26 billion in revenue last year, or $2.5 million each. While exchange rates and fiscal calendars complicate comparisons to U.S. companies, let's do it anyway. Over roughly the same time frame, Microsoft employees generated $624,000 each; Google's performed 50 percent better, at $994,000, though still less than half as well as Nintendo employees. Nintendo's profits reached almost $1.5 billion, or $442,000 per employee, last year, compared with Microsoft's $177,000 and Google's $288,000. Such gaudy numbers aren't the result of mere penny-pinching. Mainly they're a product of the strategic course Iwata has set. When he took over, PlayStation2 was king, and Microsoft, with its Xbox, was challenging Sony in a technological arms race. But Iwata felt his competitors were fighting the wrong battle. Cramming more technology into consoles would only make the games more expensive, harder to use, and worst of all, less fun. "We decided that Nintendo was going to take another route - game expansion," says Iwata, seated on the edge of a leather chair, leaning over green tea in a three-piece suit, a strip of gray emerging along the part in his thick hair. He has an easy command of English but speaks through an interpreter. "We are not competing against Sony or Microsoft. We are battling the indifference of people who have no interest in videogames." The first test of the strategy came in 2004 with the Nintendo DS. Handhelds weren't a new concept. Nintendo had sold tens of millions of Game Boys. But Sony's forthcoming PSP was being touted as a multimedia machine rich in technology and with an ability to play movies. Iwata went cheaper, smaller (the size of the device), and broader (the intended market). The DS has side-by-side screens, one of which is a touchscreen; Wi-Fi; and voice recognition - all to make it approachable and communal. To put those features to use, Iwata conceived what would become one of the bestselling games for the DS, "Brain Age." Based on the brain-training regimen developed by a Japanese neuroscientist, "Brain Age" tests and improves mental acuity. With sales of more than 12 million copies, the title has made the DS a hit in such unlikely places as nursing homes. Iwata also oversaw development of a talking cookbook "game." And of course Miyamoto kicked in, creating the pet-care game "Nintendogs," which has moved more than 14 million copies. As of this spring the company has sold more than 40 million DS devices, compared with 25 million PSPs. So when it came time to launch the Wii, Nintendo already had a model to follow. The typical life cycle of a game console goes something like this: Manufacturer produces or commissions the most sophisticated parts it can come up with and hopes to milk them for half a decade. Both the PS3 and Xbox 360, for example, have processors that are far more powerful than you'll find in most PCs. Each uses high-end graphics chips that support high-definition games; Sony even includes a Blu-ray DVD drive. The boxes are expensive at first. Hard-core game freaks pay dearly to have a console early, but sales really jump in years two, three and four, as Moore's law and economies of scale drive prices down and third-party developers release must-have games. By year five the buzz has begun about the next generation, and the onetime latest, greatest machine can be found at a local garage sale for $50. Rinse. Wash. Repeat. The Wii busted that mold. First, Nintendo used off-the-shelf parts from numerous suppliers. Sony co-developed the PS3's screaming-fast 3.2-gigahertz "cell" chip and does the manufacturing in its own facilities. Nintendo bought its 729-megahertz chip at Kmart. (Not really. But it might as well have.) Its graphics are marginally better than the PS2 and the original Xbox, but they pale next to the PS3 and Xbox 360. Taking this route enabled the company to introduce the Wii at $250 in the U.S. (vs. $599 for the PS3 and $399 for the 360) and still turn a profit on every unit. And while a $250 sticker makes the Wii more of an impulse buy than even an iPod, it's not the pricetag that makes it fly off shelves. As with DS, the Wii comes with Wi-Fi, which gives customers access to the Internet, and features an incredibly addictive Mii channel. Players craft likenesses of themselves (or anyone else; the little cartoons you see throughout this article are Miis), which then appear in boxing, tennis, golf and other games. Get inside the Wiimote The only thing more fun than bowling in your living room with a bunch of friends is having their digital counterparts cheer you on from the alley inside your TV. The experience makes you forget about graphics altogether. You don't mind that your Mii is missing arms and legs. And of course the Wii has that innovative interface, the Wii Remote. The Wiimote, as it has come to be known, features a speaker, a rumble pack that makes the device shake, and even a mystery feature or two that have yet to be exploited, like a microphone jack. (Wii Karaoke perhaps?) But the Wiimote's magic really comes down to a $2.50 chip developed by a company in Cambridge, Mass., called ) or ADI. Known as a three-axis accelerometer ( ), the chip precisely measures movement in three dimensions. At four square millimeters, several accelerometers would fit on your thumbnail. Prying open a Wiimote, ADI applications engineer Harvey Weinberg explains how the innards work. "This is actually a pretty cool piece of engineering," he says. "There's a Bluetooth link in here, a little bitty speaker, and an infrared camera. Of course the most important part is the accelerometer." The camera communicates with the light bar, which sits above or below the TV set. This is important because of a player's tendency to swing the remote wildly while, say, trying to hit a baseball 450 feet. Each time the camera faces the TV, the machine reestablishes a player's whereabouts. "The Nintendo guys were going to get large errors if they didn't figure out how to get absolute position," Weinberg says. "The camera resets the positional error. But they couldn't have gotten it to work with IR alone because most of the time you're not facing the TV. They couldn't have gotten it to work really good unless it was wireless. And they've aggressively chosen components that don't use a lot of power. The whole thing is synergistic." Nintendo designed dozens of prototypes before settling on the Wiimote. Miyamoto says early versions looked more like a control pad. Some were whimsical, some complicated. Designers arrived at the current version by coming back to Iwata's decree to battle indifference, not the competition. Miyamoto realized it wasn't a fear of gadgets that kept the average consumer from playing games. "TV remotes are always sitting out on a coffee table or on the sofa, but videogame controllers - people don't want them lying around," he says. "In that sense we thought we were losing to the TV remote. So we thought, What kind of controller can we create that won't make people afraid to touch it?" Under Miyamoto's creative direction Nintendo has never had a problem coming up with great games. Pokémon, Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda - Nintendo titles have dominated the bestseller list for each Nintendo console. But that's not necessarily a good thing for the company. Third-party games increase consumer interest in the hardware, which sells more software. What's more, the console manufacturer gets a licensing fee for every third-party game sold, and it bears no development costs. "It really is pure profit," says Reggie Fils-Aime, the president and COO of Nintendo of America. "Third-party games can really determine who wins." Fils-Aime, an intense, 46-year-old Haitian-American, introduced the Wii at a trade show in 2004 by announcing, "My name is Reggie. I'm about kickin' ass, I'm about takin' names and we're about makin' games." That opening salvo lit a fire under the gaming media and Nintendo fanboys, and now Fils-Aime is trying to do the same in the game-development community. Where Sony went wrong He's got a good pitch: Because the Wii isn't high-def, a game can cost as little as $5 million to develop, compared with up to $20 million for the PS3. That message, and the fact that the Wii is clobbering the PS3 in the marketplace, seem to be getting across. While Nintendo's own titles still top the Wii charts, third-party titles are selling well. Yves Guillemot, president and CEO of French game publisher Ubisoft, says Nintendo has become the top console maker to work with. Two of Ubisoft's games, Rayman: Raving Rabbids and Red Steel (in which you use the Wiimote like a sword), have sold nearly a million units each. "We looked at the capabilities of the Wii early on and saw that it was solving the most important element in the game industry - accessibility," Guillemot says. Both the Wii and the DS, Guillemot adds, have Ubisoft developers thinking creatively about what constitutes a game. Later this year Ubisoft will unveil "My Life Coach" and "My Word Coach," titles developed in collaboration with a behaviorist and a linguist, respectively. "Nintendo has been very open with us," says Guillemot. "They're willing to do things that are a bit crazy. They see what we want to do and help us to make it as good as possible." It took a while, but the industry's largest publisher, ), has also come around to the Wii. At EA headquarters in Silicon Valley, developers glow at how the Wiimote opens a new aspect of games like "The Godfather" and "Tiger Woods". The company developed a new Wii-exclusive game, "MySims," due out in the fall; it is working with Steven Spielberg on a Wii title; and its latest FIFA soccer game will use Mii characters. "Nintendo is a pioneer," says John Schappert, COO of EA Studios. "They're zigging when others are zagging. It's another growth curve for the industry." "We are successfully moving up the blue ocean," Iwata says. "But once the blue ocean has become big enough for so many people to notice, it is going to change its color to red." Talk about lost in translation. Turns out there's a name for the line of attack Iwata has been taking: the blue-ocean strategy. Two years ago business professors W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne published a book by that title. It theorizes that the most innovative companies have one thing in common - they separate themselves from a throng of bloody competition (in the red ocean) and set out to create new markets (in the blue ocean). Starbucks is an example. There's always been coffee; Howard Schultz gave us the coffee experience. Or Apple, which gave us the iPod and iTunes - and created a new form of entertainment. Iwata set his course before the book was published, but now that he's read it, he feels validated. "Even before someone invented the term blue-ocean strategy, we were exercising it," he says. "It is an unwritten company credo, something that runs deep in our DNA." The Wii's success has done little to convince Microsoft executives they're on the wrong course. The company is positioning itself for a world where people play multiplayer games, download movies and control their TVs through one box. "Nintendo has created a unique and innovative experience," says Peter Moore, who runs Microsoft's Xbox business. "I love the experience, the price point, and Nintendo content." But Microsoft, Moore adds, "provides experiences that Nintendo cannot provide." Of course Microsoft has little more to lose than money, and there's plenty of that to go around. Sony is another matter. Gaming has been the company's profit center for years. Suddenly, when everyone thought the PS3 would solidify Sony's dominance, along came the Wii. With an unheard-of price and few quality games to choose from, the PS3 has produced disappointing sales; the father of the PlayStation, Ken Kutaragi was recently forced to resign his post as chairman of Sony Computer Entertainment. But while he acknowledges a slow start, Jack Tretton, the president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America, thinks it's too early to start talking winners. "You have to give Nintendo credit for what they've accomplished," says Tretton, who's quick to point out that Sony has come out with some innovative controllers too. "But if you look at the industry, any industry, it doesn't typically go backwards technologically. The controller is innovative, but the Wii is basically a repurposed GameCube. If you've built your console on an innovative controller, you have to ask yourself, Is that long term?" Iwata knows the Wiimote alone won't sustain Nintendo forever. But Tretton's question nicely encapsulates two distinct approaches toward innovation. Despite the fact that the PS2, with its seven-year-old innards, is still the top-selling game console, Sony views the world through the eyes of an engineer, seeing an impressive proprietary technology (Betamax, Memory Stick, Blu-ray) and foisting it on the market. From that point of view, less technology is always a step backward. Nintendo takes its cues from the outside world - Miyamoto's garden, for example, which was the inspiration for the Nintendo game Pimkin. Or from the behavior of everyday people, like the way we leave our TV remotes on the couch. In Miyamoto's eyes technology is just a tool, and less of it is often more. "What I want to do," he says, "is to make it so people can actually feel something unprecedented." So what's next for this company, so full of surprises? The Wii gives Nintendo a few options. It could stick with the current Wii for a few years until today's top-end technology falls to Kmart prices. At that point it could introduce a Wii 2.0 with technology similar to today's PS3, but on the cheap. It could cut $50 off the sticker to compete with the price cuts that are undoubtedly coming from Sony and Microsoft. But that's red-ocean thinking. Iwata wants to keep innovating, to do for gaming what Starbucks has done for coffee or Apple has done for music. "The relationship with the Mac or PC to iTunes and the iPod," he says, "that kind of combination may be possible between DS and Wii." Until Nintendo gets more Wiis on retail shelves, all that is theoretical. Iwata says no single bottleneck has caused the shortage, and that has made the problem harder to solve. Because it was targeting a market that didn't exist, the company had no idea how popular the machine would be. And nobody could have known the Wii would still be selling so well as summer approaches. That kind of thing just doesn't happen in the Christmas-centric world of gaming. "We cannot simply make 1.5 times as much or two times as much," he says. "When you're making one million a month already, getting to 1.5 million or two million is not very easy." From the June 11, 2007 issue Economic growth slowest since '02 Wachovia to buy A.G.

Find new customers now. Toshiba To Use AMD Chip In Laptop PCs 7:19 AM EDT Tue. May. 29, 2007 AMD will start providing microprocessors to Toshiba, ending the Japanese electronics maker's exclusive ties with Intel, Toshiba said on Tuesday. Most other global PC makers, including Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Acer are already procuring microprocessors from AMD as well as from Intel, AMD's far larger rival with a market share of around 80 percent. Toshiba, the world's fourth-largest laptop PC maker, expects to put AMD processors in about 20 percent of the notebooks it sells in the United States and Europe, which account for about 60 percent of its overall PC operations. The number of Toshiba laptop PCs loaded with AMD chips can be calculated at about 1.1 million units a year as Toshiba's overall notebook PC shipments came to 9.2 million units in calendar 2006, according to research firm IDC. Toshiba plans to put AMD chips in moderate-priced standard models for individual and corporate clients, Toshiba spokeswoman Yuko Sugahara said. "With PCs becoming commodity products, there seems to be a new way of thinking that competition should be introduced even in procurement of such core parts like processors as long as there are no major differences in product specifications," Macquarie Securities analyst Yoshihiro Shimada said. "This could be a message that an era in which Intel took the lion's share of microprocessor profits as the king of PC chips is over." Fujitsu and NEC, Toshiba's two major domestic rivals, procure microprocessors from both Intel and AMD. The value of the Toshiba-AMD deal was not available, but prices of AMD's notebook-use microprocessors range from $86 to $263 apiece in a block of 1,000 units. The Nikkei business daily reported earlier that prices of AMD-equipped PCs are expected to sell for up to 10,000 yen ($82) less than comparable models. Toshiba will install AMD chips in some models to be released this summer, enabling it to reduce parts-procurement costs by at least 10 percent, the paper said. Shares of Toshiba closed up 1.2 percent at 908 yen, outperforming the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index, which gained 0.44 percent.

After Mossberg asked Jobs about the popularity of Apple's music store software and Jobs said more than 300 million copies were in circulation, Mossberg replied: "So that makes you an enormous Windows software developer" "We are," said Jobs. "How does that make you feel?" "We've got cards and letters from lots of people that say iTunes is their favorite app on Windows," Jobs said, then shrugged, paused and smiled. "It's like giving a glass of ice water to somebody in hell," he said. Although the comment likely won't rank with one of Jobs' most famous Windows swipes -- his "The only problem with is they just have no taste, they have absolutely no taste" -- the remark got a loud laugh from the D: audience. Ironically, during a later Q&A with attendees, Jobs acknowledged that he has read some of the entries on "The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs" blog, where an unidentified writer known as Fake Steve Jobs (FSJ) poses as the Apple CEO. On the blog today, FSJ commented on "his" Windows = hell riff. "The analogy isn't perfect," said FSJ. "You can't get out of hell . You can get out of Windows."

The first is the Spring 2007 edition of Microsoft&#39;s Blue Hat Security Briefings where researchers are invited to Redmond "to share knowledge and to educate and help protect customers against common threats." This is the fifth series of Blue Hat briefings and, as usual, Microsoft is hush-hush about the list of attendees and presenters. IDG&#39;s Robert McMillan was able to find out the names of a few hackers on the speaker list &#8212; Robert Hansen (RSnake), David Maynor, John Hering and Rob Thomas &#8212; but details are very scarce. A source tells me Maynor (pictured) and Robert Graham, co-founders at Errata Security, are talking about how to evade security tools and Hansen is giving a presentation on Web application security. Hardware hacker Bonnie Huang is also giving a talk at Blue Hat. Immediately after Blue Hat, the hackers will move to a more informal setting for , an invite-only get-together of around 100 security professionals. ToorCon Seattle (Beta) runs from May 11-13 and features a single track of 20 minute talks and 5 minute lightning talks. The ToorCon Seattle schedule looks very intriguing.

"I have no doubt that global  that a trend of global warming exists," Griffin told National Public Radio's in an interview set for broadcast today. "I'm not sure it's fair to say that is a problem we must wrestle with." NPR made a transcript of Griffin's remarks available Wednesday. "To assume that is a problem is to assume that the state of the Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure it doesn't change," he said. "First of all, I don't think it's within the power of human beings to assure that the climate does not change, as millions of years of history have shown. "Second of all, I guess I would ask which human beings  where and when  are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we might have right here today, right now, is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take." Environmental groups criticized Griffin's remarks as irresponsible. Griffin's remarks suggest NASA is prepared to ignore the findings gathered by its own satellites and scientists, said Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, a nonpartisan watchdog group. "The science performed by NASA as well as scientists around the world shows that global warming is no longer an environmental issue. It's a rapidly advancing human disaster," Clapp said. "Millions of people across the world will face hunger, flooding from a rise in sea levels and water scarcity. To try to hide that by saying we don't know what the climate should be is ignoring the science of his own agency." However, David Mould, NASA's chief spokesman, said Griffin was attempting in his remarks to characterize the space agency's role in assessing environmental issues. "NASA is providing the vast majority of the data on global climate. We analyze some of the data," Mould said. "But the policies beyond the analysis of the data, he was trying to say, are outside the scope of NASA's mission. Others, including Congress, will decide that." Indeed, Griffin said in the interview that NASA is chartered by Congress to study global warming and not to combat it. But Griffin's assessment merely reflects a Bush administration reluctance to address a major environmental problem, according to David Willett, chief spokesman for the Sierra Club, the nation's oldest environmental advocacy group. "What makes it doubly concerning is that NASA is on the front line, really able to sound the warning bell of what's happening to our planet because they get the planet-wide view," Wiliett said. "They have given the scientific consensus already. They should feel an obligation to be looking at the issue of global warming as a problem that needs to be addressed, not as a phenomenon that simply needs to be studied." Last year, James Hansen, the space agency's chief climatologist, charged that a young political appointee in the agency's public affairs branch had tried to stop him from speaking out on his long-standing concerns over global warming. When Congress took issue, Griffin responded with a policy that affirmed the agency's commitment to open scientific and technical inquiry and public disclosure.

Two new museums are opening this summer in the United States and Canada, which present the story of Earth's creation according to the literal teachings of the Bible in the Book of Genesis. The Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, across the Mississippi River from Cincinnati, Ohio, opened on Monday and describes itself as a "counter (to) evolutionary natural history museums that turn minds against Scripture ­ and Jesus Christ, the Creator of the universe." The Big Valley Creation Science Museum is slated to open Saturday in the Canadian province of Alberta. The US has long been more open to the ideas of creation than most countries, but what makes these museums unique is that they tackle Darwin's evolutionary theory head-on, offering up scientific evidence to back the creationist's version of events. Both for example proudly display fossils, bones and high-tech models of dinosaurs. The 27-million-dollar Kentucky museum has what critics described as Disney-like rides and showcases that place prehistoric children among the giant reptiles. The problem according to scientists: dinosaurs roamed the planet more than 60 million years ago. Creationists contend that the world is no more than 6,000 years old and say the museums display "considerable evidence that not only did dinosaurs exist recently, but that humans existed with them," according to the Big Valley museum in Canada. Museums are only the latest battleground in a decades-long struggle for supremacy between the two camps, beginning with a court ruling in Tennessee in 1927 - known in the US as the Scopes Monkey Trial - that upheld a state law barring evolution from being taught in schools. It took the US Supreme Court another 40 years to rule such laws unconstitutional, and another 20 years after that to strike creationism out of scientific teaching entirely. In 1987 the court ruled that creation could be taught in current affairs, philosophy or history classes, but not as a science. Though a majority of Americans believe there was some form of divine intervention in the world's development, proponents of creationism have gained back little ground since the 1987 ruling. According to a 2005 poll by the magazine Science, only 40 per cent of Americans accept a theory of evolution that leaves no room for divine intervention, compared to about 95 per cent of scientists. But a majority also believe that evolution, and not creation, should be taught in science class. That hasn't stopped a vocal group of mainly Protestant, Evangelical Christians from launching efforts to keep creationist teaching in public schools as a counterweight to Darwinism. School boards in various US states over the last decade have tried to place restrictions on teaching evolution - such as a "disclaimer" in textbooks - but none of the initiatives have lasted long. Now, with the opening of the two museums dedicated to creationism, it has been the turn of the scientific community to protest. More than 900 scientists in Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana signed a petition arguing that the museum's teachings were scientifically inaccurate, and voicing concern about the effect it might have on students. "Students who accept this material as scientifically valid are unlikely to succeed in science courses at the college level," according to the petition, launched by the National Centre for Science Education. "These students will need remedial instruction in the nature of science." At least 3,500 teachers from around the US signed an even stronger worded petition charging the organization running the US museum, Answers in Genesis (AIG), with "a nefarious campaign to institutionalize a lie." "This opposition hates the fact that the Creation Museum is showing the world that the Bible's history is confirmed by real science," Ken Ham, president of AIG, wrote in his internet blog. dpa cc prUS-Religion/Science/ FEATURE: The science of Genesis: two museums open in North America By Chris Cermak, dpa = Washington- Creationism, in a direct challenge to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, has found a new means of spreading its message in the United States.

EMI is one of the four big records labels in the world and made a historic contract with Apple when they announced they would sell DRM-free music over the iTunes music service. The entire EMI catalog is going to be available with the exception of &#8220;The Beatles&#8221; records. DRM restricts the sharing of digital music limiting what the user can actually do with what they download and what devices they can enjoy the music on. A DRM-free platform has been the hope of iTunes users for quite some time. Reports that it could be ready as soon as this week as they stated by the end of May they would all be available. The prices for songs would be $1.29 each, which is 30 cents more than the standard $.99 cents per song for the DRM versions.

"To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or have had and that we need to take steps to make sure it doesn't change" NASA administrator Michael Griffin on National Public Radio's Morning Edition. Griffin said he accepted that the planet's temperature has risen about 1 degree centigrade over the last century and that human activity is responsible for the increase, but he questioned the necessity and effectiveness of efforts to fight climate change. "First of all, I don't think it's within the power of human beings to assure that the climate does not change, as millions of years of history have shown," Griffin said. "And second of all, I guess I would ask which human beings -- where and when -- are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take." Griffin's comments drew quick rebukes from advocates of efforts to fight global warming, including some of NASA's own scientists studying the issue. James Hansen, the space agency's top climate change scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, called Griffin's comments "arrogant and ignorant," "It indicates a complete ignorance of understanding the implications of climate change," Hansen told ABC News. released by NASA late Wednesday night -- following the release of a transcript of his NPR remarks -- Griffin re-iterated his position. "NASA is the world's preeminent organization in the study of Earth and the conditions that contribute to climate change and global warming," Griffin said. "...It is NASA's responsibility to collect, analyze and release information. It is not NASA's mission to make policy regarding possible climate change mitigation strategies." Hansen published new research this week that finds the Earth's climate is nearing a "tipping point" where a relatively small amount of further warming will have dire consequences. "If global emissions of carbon dioxide continue to rise at the rate of the past decade, this research shows that there will be disastrous effects," Hansen said in a announcing the research. These include "increasingly rapid sea level rise, increased frequency of droughts and floods, and increased stress on wildlife and plants due to rapidly shifting climate zones."

Goes Green Whales Make It To Sea May 31st, 2007 by Dan All the world is a theater, and the two whales stuck on an international stage for the past several weeks had a happy ending. The mother-calf duo captured international attention as they became lost dozens of miles up the Sacramento River. Scientists, whale enthusiasts &#8212; and soon, anyone watching the evening news &#8212; were captivated by the whales&#8217; inability to right themselves, and concerned by their inability to heal their wounds in the freshwater. Tuesday night, without fanfare or direct observation, the whales are believed to have slipped back into the Pacific. The episode shows that the natural world can provide lasting entertainment, and even a few happy endings. Big Organic Just Got Bigger A Major Realty Co. Goes Green Copyright 2007 Gannett Company, Inc. Lost whales may now be in open sea; Humpbacks haven't been seen since late Tuesday SAN FRANCISCO -- Rescuers have lost the two lost whales. Search boats and helicopters scoured San Francisco Bay and open ocean outside it on Wednesday but saw no sign of the mother humpback and her calf. The pair had been spotted less than 10 miles from the Golden Gate Bridge late Tuesday near Tiburon, Calif. The whales might have slipped beneath the bridge under cover of darkness and returned to familiar waters of the Pacific Ocean after milling around in an inland river delta for more than two weeks. The humpbacks, members of an endangered species that migrates annually between Mexico, Costa Rica and California's coast, presumably are feeding and healing after a risky sojourn that mobilized resources of at least five government agencies, created a local frenzy and captured global attention. Reason for run unknown Why, after so many days in waters as far as 90 miles from the coast, did the whales suddenly decide to make virtually a bee-line run back to salt water? "Really hard to say," says Doreen Gurrola, assistant education director at the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, Calif. "Could be they recognized their route and realized the ocean was nearby. They could have sensed something -- sounds, a chemical change, strong currents -- that made them know they were closer." They may have detected saltier water as they moved farther south in the bay, away from the mouth of the Sacramento River, Gurrola says, though it's not known whether whales have that ability. Or they may have heard their buddies. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) vessel spotted humpback and blue whales Wednesday feeding on krill, a tiny shrimplike invertebrate, near the Farallon Islands west of San Francisco. Researchers will analyze recordings of sounds from those whales to try to learn whether the lost whales could have heard them and followed them out of the bay, says Trevor Spradlin, a NOAA marine mammal biologist. "We know whales communicate and we know sounds travel, particularly low-frequency sounds," he says. The boat saw "whales of all ages out there having a feast," NOAA spokesperson Mary Jane Schramm says As of Wednesday night, the agencies were preparing to shut down the rescue effort, says Jim Oswald, a spokesman for the mammal center. Had the lost pair been spotted in the bay, officials were ready to reroute commuter ferries to keep clear of them. Human efforts to lure the animals back to their Pacific comfort zone -- recorded sounds of humpback and killer whales, herding by boats, fire hoses -- seemed to have little effect. "They moved on their own accord. They weren't reacting to our stimuli," Gurrola says. After swimming around near the Port of Sacramento for days, drawing crowds of residents to riverbanks to see them, the whales headed toward the bay last week. At first, they seemed to be confused by bridges encountered along the way and at one point turned back upriver. By last weekend, they were on the move again, though they hesitated and retreated from the Benicia-Martinez bridge humming with holiday traffic. They finally entered the bay Tuesday. Marine biologists said their injuries would heal faster now that they were in salt water. An encounter with a boat's keel is thought to have caused a 2-foot-long gash and a deep scrape on the mother and a flank wound on the calf. Each got a dose of antibiotics Saturday administered with a gun firing a foot-long syringe. California's lieutenant governor dubbed the mother whale Delta and her calf Dawn, though the juvenile's gender isn't known. The last time a whale swam inland was in 1990, when the famous Humphrey made a return visit after appearing first in 1986 and staying 26 days. Rescuers weren't worried that the whales would starve. Humpbacks don't start feeding along the coast until early May, on a diet of mostly schooling fish such as sardines and anchovies. These whales appeared to have plenty of fat, Gurrola says. "They weren't looking emaciated. They still had that roundness, that girth," she says. "It's when you can see the outline of their backbone that you're really concerned." The whales could have missed the right turn into the Golden Gate, instead swam under the Bay Bridge and kept going south along the east side of San Francisco almost as far as San Jose. That could have extended the daily whale rescue flotilla indefinitely. As it was, as many as 12 boats with more than 40 aboard hovered near the animals, keeping pleasure boats at least 500 yards away and trying to coax the animals to the sea. California's Fish and Game Department, the Coast Guard, NOAA, the Vallejo fire department and the Solano County sheriff lent vessels. California Highway Patrol helicopters helped pinpoint the whales each morning. "It's hard to say how much this cost," says Coast Guard Petty Officer Jon Cilley. "No one has sat down to figure it out." Copyright &copy; 2007 LexisNexis, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. .

Feds Arrest 'Spam King' in Seattle IRS Spoof Targets Execs Through RTF CDW Accepts $7.3 Billion To Go Private Palm Foleo: A 'Smartphone Companion' Samsung Debuts 4-GB Mobile Chipset On Wednesday, Apple launched two new elements within its iTunes Music Store: iTunes Plus and iTunes U. Analysts described the new features as an evolutionary move designed to broaden the iTunes user base. The new iTunes Plus offers DRM-free music tracks encoded in AAC at 256 Kbps for $1.29 per song. Plus launches with EMI's digital catalog, including singles and albums from Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, Norah Jones, Frank Sinatra, Joss Stone, Pink Floyd, John Coltrane, and more than a dozen of Paul McCartney's classic albums. "Our customers are very excited about the freedom and amazing sound quality of iTunes Plus," Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO, said in a statement. "We expect more than half of the songs on iTunes will be offered in iTunes Plus versions by the end of this year." With the release of iTunes Plus, customers can download tracks from EMI artists without limitations on the type of music player or number of computers on which the purchased songs can be played. The iTunes Plus songs will play on all iPods, Macs, Windows PCs, as well as many other digital music players. The iTunes store will continue to offer its entire catalog, currently over five million songs, in the same versions as today -- 128 Kbps AAC with DRM -- at 99 cents per song, alongside the higher quality iTunes Plus versions, when available. Customers can upgrade their library of previously purchased EMI content to iTunes Plus tracks for 30 cents a song, or $3.00 for most albums. EMI called the launch of the DRM-free iTunes content a significant milestone, and NPD Group analyst Russ Crupnick agreed. He predicted DRM in the digital world might eventually cease altogether for two reasons: higher price points are favorable to the industry and DRM-free content could open up new sales avenues. "DRM-free music is a way of getting more people into the practice of buying digital music. The hope is that other music stores could offer content that would get more people into the whole digital music arena," Crupnick said. "To me, that's the next important step. We've got a lot of early adopters coming in. But how do you start to mainstream digital music? This might help." Apple didn't stop there. The company also announced the launch of iTunes U, a dedicated area within the iTunes store featuring free content such as course lectures, language lessons, lab demonstrations, sports highlights, and campus tours provided by top U.S. colleges and universities including Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Duke University, and MIT. "iTunes U makes it easy for anyone to access amazing educational material from many of the country's most respected colleges and universities," Eddy Cue, Apple's vice president of iTunes, said in a statement. "Education is a lifelong pursuit and we're pleased to give everyone the ability to download lectures, speeches, and other academic content for free." with colleges and universities, iTunes U aims to make it easier to extend learning, explore interests, learn more about a school, and stay connected with an alma mater. The move demonstrates Apple's intent to make iTunes more of a community, according to Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering Group. "Apple has traditionally played a strong role in the public school system and now iTunes U goes up the ladder a little bit by offering a music interface that gives people access to content that's not always easy to get," Doherty noted. "We're entering into a phase of our economy where education is becoming more important, so this is a wonderful move for people."

The information scientists gathered includes sound recordings, logs of their behavior and tissue samples from both the mother and calf, which will be analyzed to determine whether they come from a pod of whales that travel between Mexico and California. "All those things are very hard to get. So what we are doing is filling up the knowledge bank on humpback whales in the wild," said Jim Oswald, a spokesman for the nonprofit Marine Mammal Center, a private scientific and rescue organization. The experience also could prove helpful in approaching other stranded whales, he said. After spending more than two weeks trying to coax the whales back to sea with mixed results, officials were ready Wednesday to declare Operation Humpback a success. Since the previously conspicuous whales had not been seen for a full day, officials assumed the duo found their way home, undoing a wrong turn that inspired a range of rescue attempts. The whales, believed to be a mother and calf, were last observed at sunset Tuesday swimming in San Francisco Bay about 10 miles north of the city. A convoy of boats that accompanied the whales across the bay to keep traffic at a distance stopped escorting them when it got dark. Officials think the whales slipped out of San Francisco Bay to the open sea late Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning, when no one was watching. To make sure the whales did not take another wrong turn, two government boats were launched Wednesday morning to look for them in the Pacific Ocean. Rescuers relied on reports from commercial vessels and Coast Guard patrols to determine if the humpbacks still were in the bay. Officials said they will never know why the humpbacks swam 90 miles inland. But their journey marks the first time the same humpbacks were studied in the wild for so long, according to Bernadette Fees, deputy director of the California Department of Fish and Game. It also was the first time that whales swimming free in the wild were successfully treated with antibiotics. The pair apparently were injured by a boat at some point, and officials said their wounds might have played a role in their becoming stranded in the fresh water of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Based on the way their skin deteriorated while they were in the delta, marine scientists now have a clearer idea of how long whales can survive in fresh water, Gulland said. After the whales were spotted near Sacramento on May 13, officials spent days trying to goad them back to the ocean, playing recordings of other whales, surrounding them with boats, blasting them with fire hoses and banging metal pipes dangling beneath the water. Those involved in the rescue effort said they did not know if the methods hastened the whales' exit or hindered it. They tried to strike a balance between getting the whales going and not making the problem worse. "What we ultimately came away with is that many of the techniques had some effect, but none of them could make a whale go in a direction it did not want to go," said John Calambokidis, a scientist with the nonprofit Cascadia Research Collective. Officials speculated Wednesday that antibiotics given to the whales on Saturday to try to heal their wounds may have been a factor in their departure. The pair began their hasty retreat from the delta after receiving them. Biologists said the saltier water where the mother humpback whale and her calf had been swimming since leaving the delta helped reverse some of the health problems caused by long exposure to fresh water. Gulland said she would not be ready to celebrate until Sunday, when she could be more certain the humpbacks were safely on their way. Officials were unsure how much was spent on the rescue efforts, but they insisted the expenditures of time and money were justified, if not required under wildlife protection laws. They urged people who were captivated by the whales and followed their progress to transfer their energy to protecting marine habitats.

First look: iTunes Plus Apple made good on its promise to add unprotected tracks to its online digital media store Wednesday. As expected, individual unprotected tracks are available for $1.29. Part 1 of a special five-part series. Wednesday, May 30, 2007 12:00 PM PDT A month ago, Apple and EMI announced that the record label would offer its entire catalog sans digital rights management protection at the iTunes Store sometime in May. With just a full day left in the month, Apple made good on the promise, adding these unprotected tracks--termed iTunes Plus--to its online digital media store Wednesday. As expected, individual unprotected tracks are available for US$1.29 per track while albums are offered at the same price as the protected version. Individual protected tracks continue to be priced at 99-cents per track. I've spent the better part of the morning cruising the Store's aisles to see just how iTunes Plus works. Here's what I've learned. In order to purchase iTunes Plus tracks you must upgrade to iTunes 7.2. Although an iTunes Plus link appears in the Quick Links area of earlier versions of iTunes, when you click it, you're instructed that you must upgrade to iTunes 7.2 to view iTunes Plus music. Once you've installed iTunes 7.2, that link takes you to the iTunes Plus page, which holds What's Hot and Featured Albums boxes similar to those on the Store's main page as well as Top Albums and Top Songs columns that list pretty much what their titles suggest. The page also contains a Genre pop-up menu, from which you can choose Alternative, Blues, Children's Music, Classical, Comedy, Country, Dance, Electronic, Folk, Hip-Hop/Rap, Holiday, Christian &amp; Gospel, Jazz, New Age, Opera, Pop, R&B/Soul, Reggae, Rock, Soundtrack, Spoken Word, Vocal, World, and iTunes Latino genres. Choose a genre and the contents of the What's Hot and Featured Albums boxes changes to reflect popular and featured albums within that genre. Shortly after iTunes Plus became available I looked through some of the categories and they show some growing pains. For example, much as I like Brian Eno's Thursday Afternoon and The Residents' Third Reich 'n' Roll I'm not sure they belong among the Store's featured classical albums. When you click on an album on the iTunes Plus page, you're asked if you'd like to set your iTunes Plus preference. If you click the iTunes Plus button at the bottom of the dialog box, you'll always be shown the iTunes Plus version of a music track or music video if one is available. Click Cancel and you'll continue to be offered protected tracks, though you'll be told that an album is also available in an iTunes Plus version (accompanied by a Learn More link that, once again, offers you the opportunity to enable the iTunes Plus preference). If you choose to enable that preference you can switch it off only from your iTunes Store account page where you access the option via a Manage iTunes Plus button. Regrettably, with iTunes Plus preferences enabled you're not shown the less-expensive protected version of the track. Likewise, with iTunes Plus disabled, you're not provided with links to the DRM-free tracks unless you click that Learn More link and, in the subsequent window, click the iTunes Plus button to enable the iTunes Plus preference. Among the few glitches I encountered shortly after the launch of iTunes Plus was an error dialog box that appeared whenever I attempted to change my iTunes Plus preferences. Fortunately, the error is in error. When I either enabled or disabled the preference, the new preference stuck, despite the error suggesting that there was a problem. Downloading an iTunes Plus track or album works almost exactly as does downloading protected tracks--the one thing you can't currently do is gift unprotected music as you can with the Store's protected music. A small iTunes Plus caption appears just above the Buy Album button on an album's page and a Plus icon followed by the $1.29 price sits to the left of each track's Buy Song button. Click one of these buttons and, by default, you're prompted for your ID and password, and your media downloads to your computer. The resulting files are encoded at a bit rate of 256kbps and are tagged with a .m4a extension. (This is the extension for unprotected AAC files, versus the .m4p extension appended to the Store's protected AAC files.) A four-minute track weighs in at just over 8MB. When signed into the Store, click the iTunes Plus link and you should see an Upgrade My Library area in the upper right corner of the resulting iTunes Plus windows. (I say should because, early in my testing, this disappeared from time to time.) This area was designed to make it easy to upgrade compatible contents of your iTunes Library to an unprotected form. Albums can be upgraded for 30-percent of the current album price, upgrades to individual music tracks cost 30 cents per track, and upgrading music videos costs 60 cents per video. So, for example, if you have a copy of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon in the old protected format, you can upgrade to the unprotected version for 30-percent of the current $7.99 album price. Under the Upgrade My Library heading you'll view a See Details button as well as the total number of songs and albums you can upgrade along with the price for doing so. Unfortunately, you can't upgrade individual tracks or albums--this is an all-or-nothing option for your entire compatible library. However, you're not forced to upgrade an entire album if you've purchased only a few tracks on it. In this case, you have to upgrade only those tracks you've purchased. Click the See Details button, and you're taken to a page that lists all the albums and tracks that can be upgraded. Click the Buy button and everything is upgraded to the iTunes Plus version. Before iTunes begins downloading the tracks, you're told that the old versions will be removed from your iTunes library. You have the option to direct iTunes to toss those tracks in the Trash or move them to your Desktop. In both cases, the tracks will appear in an Original iTunes Purchases folder, organized by Artist and Album folders. So, for example, within the Original iTunes Purchases folder, you'll find an Al Green folder that contains a folder for the Reverend's I Can't Stop album. With a tiny measure of luck, the upgraded versions of the tracks will download to your computer. I mention luck because, early in iTunes Plus' short life, this was a hit-or-miss affair for me. Of the 48 tracks I attempted to upgrade, 14 failed with an unknown (504) error. These were tracks from the aforementioned Al Green album and Brian Eno and J. Peter Schwalm's Drawn From Life. Subsequent attempts to download the tracks failed as well. I had no problems upgrading the Rolling Stones' Jump Back and the Berlin Philharmonic's recording of Brahms' A German Requiem. The total price of all this upgrading: $13.46. As I mentioned, non-protected tracks are encoded at 256kbps--that's twice the 128kbps bit-rate that protected songs are encoded at. Using iTunes I burned both protected and the new unprotected versions of The Stones' Jump Back and Brahms' Requiem to CD to see how they sounded through the Denon amplifier, Sony CD player, and B&W speakers in my living room. I wish I could say that the difference between the two versions was like night and day, but it wasn't. Bearing in mind that everyone's hearing is different and therefore my conclusions are purely subjective, in comparison to the protected versions, the DRM-free versions of the recordings sounded like a thin layer of film was washed away from them. In the Requiem, for example, you could more easily hear the bows' rosin and the distinct overtones of the timpani rather than their less-distinct thump in the protected version. And passages where the choir and orchestra are going at full force, the unprotected version sounds less confused--you can more easily pick out voices and instruments rather than being overwhelmed with waves of sound. Given that the Stones produce some of the dirtiest recordings in the business, I understand that using their music--some of it recorded decades ago--is an odd way to test the quality of a recording. Yet comparing the two versions of "Angie," I could more distinctly hear the tap on the cymbal's bell and closed high-hat and the 12-string guitar rings a bit more clearly. And, as with the Requiem, the various parts are a touch easier to discern. Will you hear a difference, and is that difference worth an extra 30-cents-per-track? It depends on the gear you use to listen to your music and the keenness of your hearing. Given that the earbuds bundled with the iPod are hardly audiophile quality, you're unlikely to get your money's worth listening to unprotected tracks with this kind of setup. On higher-end gear--good headphones or quality stereo speakers--you might find these tracks more to your liking. Again, the difference between protected and unprotected versions is anything but startling, but if you've stayed away from the Store in the past because you're unhappy with the quality of its tracks, you may find those offered in unprotected form more pleasing. I'll continue monitoring iTunes Plus and, with my company's gracious permission, download and scrutinize a variety of iTunes' unprotected tracks and music videos.

http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/national/BO53751/&cid WHDH-TV - National News - Cosmonauts finish a spacewalk to install protective panels on international space station Health & Fitness Expo Closing Bell on Your Cell Send it to 7 Wednesday, May 30, 2007 Email this article to a friend Cosmonauts finish a spacewalk to install protective panels on international space station CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Two Russian cosmonauts climbed out of the international space station Wednesday to install protective panels designed to shield the orbiting outpost from dangerous space debris. Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov opened a hatch on the Russian side of the space station at 3:05 p.m. EDT. The spacewalk ended about 51/2 hours later. "Hooray! We're back home!" one of the cosmonauts said after climbing back into the space station airlock. The only lament from the first-time spacewalkers came at the end, from a cosmonaut who complained about an ill-fitted glove on his spacesuit. Both men were tethered during the spacewalk to keep them from floating away. The station's third occupant, U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams, remained inside. Space debris includes objects such as discarded rocket parts, planetary dust and rocks. Scientists consider it the greatest threat to the space station, orbiting about 220 miles above Earth. Kotov rode at the end of a crane operated by Yurchikhin to reach the stack of aluminum panels about 60 feet from the hatch. The 17 protective panels, each about 2 feet by 3 feet and weighing about 20 pounds, were delivered to the station last December and left outside in a formation dubbed "the Christmas tree." The cosmonauts installed five of the panels on a Russian section of the space station, and the others were to be put in place during a spacewalk next week. Engineers on the ground are able to monitor by radar the largest pieces of space debris -- objects larger than a softball -- and adjust the station's position accordingly, so the shielding will protect against smaller objects. "The consequence of small particles is not so great," said Kirk Shireman, NASA's deputy program manager for the space station. "Then there are the midrange particles. Those are the ones we worry about." An independent safety task force in February said that there was a 9 percent risk that the space station, once completed in 2010, could be hit with space debris severe enough to cause the loss of the outpost or crew members. That risk estimate was reduced to 5 percent if protective panels were installed on Russian portions of the space station. Sections of the space station built by NASA and the Japanese and European space agencies were protected sufficiently against space debris, the task force said. The spacewalk started about 45 minutes late, but a bright moon allowed the cosmonauts to catch up by working through what normally would have been darkness after orbital sunsets. The space station circles the Earth every 90 minutes. Asked by Mission Control in Moscow how it felt in their spacesuits once they were outside, one of the cosmonauts joked: "Kind of cloudy, a bit rainy. We didn't take an umbrella with us." The cosmonauts also successfully rerouted a cable for a navigation antenna that will be used later in the year for the first flight of a new European cargo vehicle. Wednesday's spacewalk was the first of two scheduled a week apart. Yurchikhin and Kotov will perform another one next Wednesday with similar tasks, including depositing canisters containing biological experiments outside the station. Space shuttle Atlantis and its seven astronauts are scheduled to fly to the station early next month. NASA managers on Wednesday began a two-day meeting at the Kennedy Space Center to decide whether to go ahead with the planned June 8 launch. A final decision was expected Thursday for the launch, which previously was postponed from mid-March because of a hailstorm that damaged the insulating foam on the shuttle's external tank.

The Apple TV remote device is one of a number of set-top boxes designed to move digital content from a user's computer to a TV set, a capability that is expected to open internet-based videos to a wider audience. But before Wednesday's announcement, Apple TV was limited to streaming content from the user's iTunes personal library. "This is the first time users can easily browse, find and watch YouTube videos right from their living room couch, and it's really, really fun," said Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive. "YouTube is a worldwide sensation, and Apple TV is bringing it directly from the internet onto the widescreen TV." Thousands of current and popular YouTube videos will be available on Apple TV when the feature launches in mid-June. The website's full catalog will be available by year's end, Apple said. The move could also make the set-top box more attractive to Canadian consumers, who so far have had less use for the device because Apple's iTunes store does not sell video featuresÂ in Canada because of broadcast rights restrictions, which require Apple to negotiate separate deals with Canadian broadcasters toÂ offer programs. Apple TV, which began shipping in March, sells at a retail price of $349 in Canada.

Japan's Toshiba ditched AMD for Intel as a maker of chips for its laptops in 2001. Since then, AMD has been fighting its way back into Toshiba's lineup in a campaign that has accelerated in recent months. The effort finally bore fruit. On May 29, AMD ( ) said Toshiba will use AMD Turion 64 X2 chips in three of its Satellite notebook PCs expected to ship in time for the back-to-school sales season this year. It's an important milestone in AMD's efforts to shake Intel's dominance of the PC chip market. Last year Dell ( ), long an Intel-exclusive PC maker, started using AMD chips (see BusinessWeek.com, 5/19/06, Other vendors like Gateway ( ) and Hewlett-Packard ( have AMD-based systems. The only household-name in personal computing to boast an Intel-exclusive relationship is Apple ( ), but Toshiba had been the last major vendor of PCs running Microsoft's ( ) Windows to claim an Intel-exclusive relationship. The roots of that relationship are a bone of contention between archrivals AMD and Intel and became legal fodder in AMD's antitrust lawsuit against Intel in 2005. Toshiba received a substantial payment from Intel that was provided on condition that Toshiba's notebook PCs contain no AMD processors, AMD alleged in the lawsuit. Toshiba "executives agreed that Intel's financial inducements amounted to 'cocaine,' but said they were hooked because reengaging with AMD would jeopardize Intel market development funds estimated to be worth $25-30 million per quarter," the filing says. Intel has denied any wrongdoing. Whatever the basis of Toshiba's decision to use Intel, frays in the arrangement have been showing for some time. Last year Toshiba confirmed that some of its executives had favored adding AMD chips to its product lineup, but backed away from the change (see BusinessWeek.com, 6/27/06, "Intel Starts to Push Back" According to sources within AMD, a recent shift in sales strategy played a key role in winning Toshiba back. Senior vice-presidents are now working directly with large accounts like Dell, HP, and Toshiba. These executives have the power to make decisions themselves that typically had to go back to AMD's upper management for approval. "We've put some of our top executives in charge of our key accounts," says AMD Senior Vice-President . "And that way we can make more decisions close to the customer without going back to HQ." Seyer is the point man in charge of AMD's relationship with Dell. Ben Williams runs AMD's relationship with HP. AMD didn't immediately name the executive in charge of the Toshiba relationship. The revamp speeds up decision-making in relation to big customers, and the promises AMD makes to them. These decisions had previously taken longer, and required sign-offs by senior execs up to and including AMD Chief Executive Officer Hector Ruiz. A byproduct of the new approach is making sure senior executives get their expectations for PC demand clearly mapped out before huge supply commitments are made. "It's all about making sure we have visibility," Seyer says. It's a lesson AMD learned the hard way. In recent years, AMD had stepped up efforts to court big customers like Dell, which require chipmakers to provide supply guarantees for set periods of time. AMD was happy to oblige, particularly in the run-up to last year's holiday selling season, when it looked like demand would be strong through the end of the year. "The demand from big PC makers like Dell and HP was strong and so AMD responded, and made strong commitments to meet that demand," says analyst Dean McCarron of Mercury Research, based in Cave Creek, Ariz. But AMD's relationships with other, smaller manufacturers began to suffer. Having made commitments to the likes of Dell, AMD found it had demand for more chips than it could realistically deliver. "AMD had to pick: The big PC makers or the channel," says McCarron, using the industry term for the smaller computer makers. "It went with the big PC makers." Intel, meantime, pounced on the channel business, winning back some territory previously lost to AMD. Fast-forward to November, 2006. Big vendors saw their sales projections weren't proving as strong as they had hoped two months prior, and having built all the computers they needed for the holiday season, they didn't need to buy any more chips. Turning its attention back to the channel, AMD found that smaller vendors, having fulfilled their needs with Intel, didn't need many AMD chips. "Everyone pretty much had all the chips they needed sitting on shelves," McCarron says. The result? AMD swiftly lost ground in the market for PC and server chips. By the end of the first quarter of 2007, AMD's overall share of the PC and server chip market had tumbled to 18.7% after having risen to 25.3% in the previous period, according to Mercury. Intel's share widened to 80.5% from 74.4%. It's too early to tell how far the Toshiba deal will help AMD regain those precious percentage points of share, but winning back the Japanese PC maker as well as a new approach to sales are a step in the right direction. is a reporter for BusinessWeek.com.

My first impression of the new Palm Foleo Mobile Companion wasn't positive because the âbig new product announcementâ wasnât what I had expected. I was thinking we might receive a new Treo based on Linux. Or maybe a new Treo form factor with a full-face touch screen, like the upcoming iPhone from Apple. So my first impression of the Palm Foleo Mobile Companion was along the lines of, âWhat is this, some kind of poor-manâs laptop? I want to see the next generation Treo!â And based on some of what Iâve been reading in the discussion forum today, I wasnât the only person who initially felt this way. But after listening closely to what Jeff Hawkins said in Palmâs webcast, I understand his vision, and that the Foleo Mobile Companion is just the first step towards a very interesting and exciting future. The Foleo Mobile Companion wonât be released until this summer, and the technical specifications haven't been clearly defined. But letâs review some of the information we have about the Foleo today: $499 after $100 mail-in rebate 0.94â thick, 6.67â deep, 10.55â wide (basically just wide enough for the full-size keyboard) The amount of internal memory is not known, but there is an internal Compact Flash slot for âbuilt-inâ memory that will be user-upgradable and an external Secure Digital slot for expanded storage. No details on the specific processor, but Jeff mentioned in the webcast that it wasnât a high-end processor so we shouldnât expect too much 5 hours of actual usage (or all day when you consider that it is powered down when you turn it off or close the lid) 10â color screen (1024x600) with VGA output (1024x768), but not a touch-screen Wi-Fi (when within range of a hotspot) or Bluetooth (using your phone) The Foleo works with the Palm Treo running Palm OS, the Palm Treo running Windows Mobile. It should also work with any Windows Mobile smartphone. There is a button mouse in the middle of the keyboard, and a scroll wheel with left and right buttons below the keyboard. There are also four arrow keys for navigating documents. Scroll wheel can be moved one click at a time to move one row at a time or faster movement moves one page at a time. âInstant Onâ so there is no delay between pressing the power button and using the Foleo. Includes a new version of Documents to Go from DataViz for viewing editing Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files. Slight ribbing on the side so it is easy to grip Like a book, the screen can be opened from the front or sides without any latches Running Linux OS with access to terminal interface Allows third-party developers to deliver additional features and functionality (just like the Palm OS and unlike the Apple iPhone) Can be password protected and you can use Treo to automatically unlock when within range What the Foleo is Today While it looks a lot like a laptop, the Foleo is described as the first device in a new category called âMobile Companionsâ. There is a difference between a mobile companion and a laptop, and in order to understand the Foleo it's necessary to understand this difference. Rather than starting with the laptop, we need to start with the original Palm Pilot. The first Palm Pilot was a personal digital assistant that allowed you to keep track of contacts, events, tasks and notes, with the ability to be extended by developers to do much more. Once the mobile phone industry could support it, the Palm OS devices evolved to support wireless networking features such as email and web browsing, becoming a new type of device called the âsmartphoneâ. Over the next few years the Treo smartphone incrementally evolved, gaining more memory, faster processors, better screens, higher resolution cameras (not necessarily better), Bluetooth support, and so on. Life was good and getting better (a possible exception being the frustrated Treo 700p users who waited a year for a maintenance release). But the more powerful the Treo smartphone became, the more obvious it became that there are two irreconcilable desires that users have. We want something with a keyboard that is easy to type on, we want a large screen for browsing the web, and we want our smartphone to be as small as possible so it is easy to carry around in our pocket. Big keyboard and big screens are simply incompatible with small devices. In my opinion, the Treo form factor is by far the best compromise between form and function when compared to any other smartphone. But it is still a compromise. And thatâs where the concept of a âmobile companionâ comes inâ¦ What are the two main problems with using a smartphone for heavy duty email, writing documents or browsing the web? The screen and keyboard are both too small. What does the Foleo do? Its primary purpose is to address these problems by providing a full-size keyboard and large screen that can be used as input and display devices for your smartphone. Jeff Hawkins emphasized this point a few times during his presentation, but it still took a while for the point to sink in for me. Since the Foleo looks like a laptop, I kept comparing it to a laptop, and while some people might be able to use the Foleo instead of laptop, I think that is more of a side effect than Palmâs intention. But just because the Foleoâs primary purpose is to be a video and keyboard extension to your smartphone doesnât mean it canât do a lot moreâ¦ Iâm thinking the Foleo would be an awesome device for browsing the web around the house. Just leave one on your coffee table and if you want to check something on the web all you need to do is open it up, turn it on and start browsing. With the instant-on feature you can be browsing in a second or two using your household Wi-Fi connection. While I love being able to browse the web with my Treo, if I have the choice between a 10â screen and a 2.5â screen, Iâll take the larger screen any day. And if I want to head down to the coffee shop for a bit of reading or writing, or possibly putting together a draft of a presentation for work, I can easily do that with the Foleo. If I need more powerful features I can always copy the files to my desktop PC, but for the majority of things I need to do on a daily basis the Foleo should be fine. What the Foleo is Not (at least Today) While it looks like a laptop, the Foleo is not intended to be a replacement for your laptop. It doesnât have the processing power or memory to run CPU-intensive applications like Photoshop or to do video editing, and it probably never will because major processing power meaningfully shortens the battery life of mobile devices. That doesnât mean the Foleo canât do many things you would normally do on your laptop. It can, just like your Treo smartphone can. But for full laptop functionality, such as being able to run Windows or Mac applications, you will still want a laptop. What the Foleo May Become I believe Palm still intends to continue making smartphones both smarter and more powerful, but with the introduction of the Foleo Mobile Companion I believe Palm now has the flexibility to explore different form factors to address different customer needs. For example, while the current Treo form factor with a built-in keyboard is targeted at users that do a lot of typing on their Treo, some users might be willing to trade the Treoâs keyboard for a larger screen and on-screen keyboard. While on on-screen keyboard isnât as usable as a fixed keyboard, this shortcoming is minimized if you can use a Mobile Companion for your more intensive data entry tasks. Also remember that the Foleo is running the Linux OS, and just like the original Palm Pilot and Palm OS, Palm is going to publish SDKs so that the developer community can build upon this new platform. There is every reason to expect that at least some of the many Linux developers out there will be looking at the Foleo as an opportunity to leverage their skills at building great applications to fill the needs of Foleo and smartphone users. I believe the Foleo is a lot like the early Palm Pilot, the first product in a new category that will evolve in the coming months and years. It may take a while for a lot of people to be convinced that these devices are useful and worth their price tag, but as functionality is added and costs come down, I believe more and more people will start to âget itâ. Like any first generation device, the first Foleo Mobile Companion will have some shortcomings and some of them will be showstoppers for certain users. The initial price is fairly high if you only see the Foleo as a full-size keyboard for your Treo, and the features are too skimpy if you see it as an alternative to a laptop. But Iâm sure that there are a number of smartphone users out there like myself who will immediately find the Foleo a useful companion for their Treo or Windows Mobile device. And I think that, just like in the early days of the Palm Pilot, the number of users will increase over time.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/technology/31digital.html&cid For Jobs and Gates, a Night to Reminisce - New York Times For Jobs and Gates, a Night to Reminisce Bill Gates and Steven P. Jobs in a rare joint appearance at a technology conference in Carlsbad, Calif. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: Calif., May 30  In a highly anticipated encounter, Bill Gates of Microsoft and Steven P. Jobs of Apple took the stage Wednesday evening to relive old battles and alliances and speculate about the future of digital culture and technology. Rivals for three decades, the two executives have rarely appeared in public together and have generally been viewed as bitter rivals, despite occasional partnerships. In front of about 600 technology executives at the D: All Things Digital conference, which was sponsored by The Wall Street Journal, the two executives attracted the attention usually reserved for rock singers and Hollywood stars. However, attendees who came hoping for fireworks or a confrontation were disappointed. The mild tone to the session did not take anything away from the event and after discussing the past and present of the computing industry, the two were greeted with a standing ovation. After the event was over a number of the attendees who are veterans of decades in the computer industry said the joint appearance was the most memorable moment of any of the many conferences they had attended. Mr. Gates and Mr. Jobs largely pioneered the personal computer industry beginning in 1975 and 1976 and they spent part of the evening sharing memories of those days. Today "we ship these computers with one or two gigabytes and nobody remembers 128 kilobytes," Mr. Jobs said. Apple and Microsoft were business partners at the start of the computer era beginning in 1977 when Mr. Gates supplied a copy of the BASIC programming language for the Apple II computer. Later, Mr. Gates made an early bet on writing software for the Macintosh, two years before the computer was introduced in 1984. Neither was willing to acknowledge the possibility that the personal computer era they helped create would end any time soon. "The PC has proven to be very resilient," Mr. Jobs said. At the same time they called themselves believers in the explosion of hand-held communications devices, also known as "Post PC devices." Mr. Gates said he was sometimes frustrated by the fact that the players in the industry changed so quickly. "I miss it when people come and go. It's nice when people stick around and it gives us some context," he said.During a question and answer period at the end of the session both men were asked to comment on the other's strengths. Mr. Gates singled out Mr. Jobs intuitive aesthetic sense. "I'd give a lot to have Steve's taste," Mr. Gates said, drawing laughter from the audience. "The way he does things, it's just different." Mr. Jobs returned the compliment, noting that Mr. Gates skills at building business partnerships were something that eluded him in his first decade at Apple. Asked to comment on today's computer industry and the youth culture that it markets to, both men pointed to examples of applications of computer technology that had been readily adopted by seniors. Mr. Gates said that when he showed the Microsoft Surface, the touch computing system introduced on Wednesday to a group of chief executives at his home several weeks ago, he was surprised they were more enthusiastic about the product than he was. The executives, he noted came from a generation that was not comfortable with keyboards. They were particularly interested in a technology that allowed them to control things on a display screen by pointing and moving them directly with their fingers. Neither man was willing to say harsh things about the other and Mr. Jobs summed up his feelings by quoting from a Beatles song: "&#61486;'You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead,' that's clearly true here," he said.

(not case-sensitive) The new iTunes Plus store Apple's new iTunes Plus is now selling unprotected music at a premium price The wave washing away DRM hits Appleâs music service with today with the announcement of iTunes Plus. The DRM-free music tracks do command a premium over the traditional $0.99 protected tracks, with each 256 kbps AAC encoded track costing the consumer $1.29 each. iTunes customers who have already purchased tracks that are now available on iTunes Plus may upgrade their library of previously purchased content to iTunes Plus tracks for just 30 cents a song and $3.00 for most albums. Songs downloaded through iTunes Plus allow customers to use their purchased content without limitations on the type of music player or number of computers that purchased songs can be played on. EMI is the first and only record label with its catalog available on the new service, as . âThis is a tremendous milestone for digital music,â said Eric Nicoli, CEO of EMI Group. âConsumers are going to love listening to higher quality iTunes Plus tracks from their favorite EMI artists with no usage restrictions.â Although only EMI currently stands alone on iTunes, more are promised within the near future. âOur customers are very excited about the freedom and amazing sound quality of iTunes Plus,â said Steve Jobs, Appleâs CEO. âWe expect more than half of the songs on iTunes will be offered in iTunes Plus versions by the end of this year.â EMIâs venture into unchained music isnât only on iTunes â the record company announced earlier this month its involvement with Amazon.comâs new MP3 music store âThis is a tremendous milestone for digital music...â This is outrageous. Since when was Apple the only company to offer DRM-free music? And how is something so obvious and irritating a "tremendous milestone"? I swear, comments like that really irk me. They swear they're doing something special even though it's what the consumers have been craving for a long while. And they're doing it wrong! An extra 30% per song for DRM-freedom? No, they shouldn't be charging extra for something that should be I agree - I also think they should be offered as MP3, since that is the format with the broadest compatibility across devices. AAC may or may not be technically superior, but MP3 is the only format supported by all devices. Apple likes to start with something bad, and gradually make it better and better so that people think they are heroes, e.g., for finally "rescuing" the consumer from DRM. LOL. oooh reading pwn3d me. I didn't notice they were in AAC format. That sucks. Apple's goal was never the broadest compatibility; if it were, they would be selling Windows. Their goal is, arguably, to sell something better. AAC at the same bitrate is better than MP3. It's not Apple's fault if vendors don't support AAC (aka MPEG4 advanced audio codec). That is like blaming Apple for vendors who choose to support WMA... Besides which, what have you done to free us from the yoke of DRM? Apple, at least, has worked with EMI to release DRM free music on the iTunes store. Apple has adopted that format as their own and I don't think its heads and tails better than a good VBR mp3 encoding. They push their format because they can get a bigger piece of the pie with every song sold. Ideally (for Apple) their AAC would take over mp3 as the most popular and dominant format, similar to what Microsoft wants with WMA. If we were lucky, open source formats (such as ogg vorbis) would take over. I suggest you do some reading about AAC ( Audio Coding, not Apple Audio Coding). It's a MPEG standard, and is license-free (ie. no one pays anyone else, certainly not Apple, to distribute AAC content) unlike either MP3 or WMA. There's already a way around Apple's DRM, and has been for a while. JHymn, then once iTunes 6.x.x.x came out and JHymn broke, QTFairUse6 and myFairTunes 6 came out and did the same thing...although you still need JHymn to do the conversion. I don't remember what bitrate the DRM'd AAC is, but if this non-DRM AAC is 256 and the DRM'd is less, that may be worth the .30c USD extra right there to have higher quality source before conversion. They sound fine and all on an MP3 player, but try playing those on high dollar audio systems...the lack of true quality AAC was developed by Dolby Labs and is licensed by them through their subsidiary, Via Licensing. It is NOT free. Everyone who uses AAC pays a royalty to Dolby/Via. See FAQ question #6 - You must pay a license fee if you develop and sell an encoder or decoder. There no license fee for distribution of AAC. Right, and you need an encoder to create the files you intend to distribute......... Unless you steal them I guess. Or did you intend to create these AAC files with the power of positive thinking? Isn't it a milestone though? According to Websterâs, a milestone, when used figuratively, is a significant event in history. Before now you had the choice of: Now we have a fourth choice: I mean, consumers can want something forever but it isn't actually important until it happens right? So when someone figures out how to make gold, that too is a milestone. BTW, the extra 30% is for the double in bit rate PLUS the DRM free. 2.5) Subscription DRM. $10-$15/month for unlimited. For me 1 + 2.5 + 3 is the ideal. 2.5 to try out all kinds of new music for around the cost of a CD a month. 1 to buy the albums I really like and rip them for any use. 3 for impossible to find imports/fan made materials. Beatport, which I've been using for years, sells DRM-free independent labels for $1.29 to $1.99. The music selection is smaller, but you can get FLAC, WAV, whatever. The Apple AAC's can be converted to whatever you want, even huge WAV's if you want. It's not an Apple proprietary standard (only the DRM version is), AAC is an open non-Apple format. It's just the highest quality one can get for a given bandwidth ("by far", I understand) which is an advantage for downloading purposes, esp. for a site like Apple's with they having to provide the total downloading bandwidth of everybody's downloads simultaneously. Helps things fit onto iPods (which most users are using, even if to the sarcastic "not all") better, makes downloading that quality level quicker, and saves their own phone bill a bit (they're not a government run charity). You lose quality when you convert. I wonder why my posting got point-hit though, I don't think I said anything controversial or anything that isn't factually correct (note that the "AAC best" comment was qualified with that being to my knowledge, and that's factually correct whether it really is best or not). AAC is an open non-Apple format. It's just the highest quality one can get for a given bandwidth ("by far", I understand) Does anyone have links to evidence to back this up? The info that I have seen as well as my subjective experience say that AAC is roughly equivalent to WMA at all bitrates, with WMA being reported as better (but not significantly so) That may be true. I haven't personally had anything that plays WMA (anything portable I mean). In any case, both are probably a lot better than MP3 which is most common (for the same filesizes). And as many have mentioned, AAC isn't an apple format, only AAC-DRM is. I only know what I read, and those I read may be "full of it". :-) I haven't personally had anything that plays WMA (anything portable I mean). I guess you've only owned iPods? as far as I know, every other portable player plays WMA, even if only unprotected WMA. Heck, my car stereo plays WMA off a CD or USB flash drive, just not subscription content. (below not addressed to you personally) AAC may have more market share in terms of total number of players in the wild, but WMA is far more standard in terms of number of manufacturers and on-line stores that support the format. Does AAC protection support subscription-style content? I really see that as the future of legal on-line distribution more than proteced purchased or even DRM-free purchased tracks. You get a cookie from me for mentioning Beatport. ;) Of course I do believe I read somewhere that you enjoy listening to EDM, so, naturally you would probably use Beatport. :) It is funny to see this "milestone" coming to the mainstream, since I've been enjoying DRM free music for many years now from non-iTunes vendors. One reason why I never bought into the iPod + iTunes idea. I still think what Apple did is a milestone, because it sells the music that the masses want. We can "thank" the money the big labels are spending for that. Indie label music, while it can have good quality titles, tends to address niche markets (in the long tail). Just because Yahoo offered some music DRM-free at $2 a pop? This is a milestone because THE major player in the online music business is now offering DRM-free tracks. Other indie labels have been offering DRM free music for ages. Nettwerk offer a choice between DRM free mp3's or DRM free .flac files (at an increased cost over mp3). Manowar have been offering their own stuff for download from their own website for a while in mp3 format. A milestone would be better priced tracks in a more open format. This is nothing more than a small stepping stone. Agreed. Not only because it's the major player in online purchasing, but because it's one of the biggest distributors as well. It's great that indie labels have already been doing it, but this could push the big distributors to do it as well. 1. Who are those others who (legally) sell non-DRM music from one of the major companies (EMI, Sony, etc)? Who else now sells the same downloadable EMI tunes? Give me URLs please, although you imply there are many, just one will do. 2. Once they all are converted to non-DRM $1.29 pricing, then non-DRM will be indeed , just as you ask for. It's just that now they offer a 23% discount for DRM'd versions. You may argue that they're too expensive. I agree, I even thought that true with LP's in the 70's. It's about time. I just downloaded iTunes, and going to browse their library. Thinking of which, I could use some new tunes on my Creative Zen MP3 player. Nevermind - I am hating the iTunes environment. btw... I am a Mac/PC user. I'll look for something else for buying/downloading music. The iTunes player is nice on my Mac, but I completely hate the store. Too bad they won't work on your Zen, they are still in iPod format (AAC). I thought they were going to use MP3. Oh well back to Amazon. Can't you convert it to MP3 if it is DRM free? Yes, just find JHymn, and either QTFairUse6 or myFairUse6 on the net and enjoy... You could convert it to MP3 even if it was DRM'd. You would just need some knowhow. As it stands, its cake to covert AAC to MP3 or WMV. I wonder about the audio quality converting from one lossless format to another. Seems like in the end, the file would have quality loss due to the combination of both formats. If they were both lossless there shouldn't be any degredation of quality, but I know that MP3 compression is not lossless. I don't know much about the other compression. I just remember that there is an option in iTunes to convert the format to MP3 as long as it isn't DRM protected. That was what I was getting at. It is already built into the program, so you won't need to use any other converting program. I doubt the AAC's being sold by iTunes are lossless. Can't you convert it to MP3 if it is DRM free? Yes you can. There's already software out there that does this. You lose quality if you convert though. AAC is NOT iPod format. It is not "owned" by Apple and they make no money from it. BTW, it's far superior to MP3. AAC is owned and licensed by Dolby. It's superior at lower bit-rates, this is true, however I personally find the differences vanish very quickly when you go over 200kbps. This is just from personal listening tests with a variety of equipment; those horrible iPod ear-buds, GOOD headphones, a decent PC surround-sound system (worth about $1200) and a high-quality home theater sound system (worth over $5000). Again, personally, I feel that there is very little difference between AAC at 192+ and a good MP3 VBR encode at 192+. At 320 kpbs (what I rip all my tunes at) both are so close to transparent it's not worth talking about. I'd rather have the convienence and flexibility of the open MP3 format. Why is MP3 open but MP4-AAC is not? You keep mentioning that AAC isn't open... but it is as open as MP3 is. The benefit of MP3 is that all devices support it - not just PMPs, but also home and car audio systems as well. I agree with you 100%. But as you stated, at lower bit rates, the AAC does have superior sound. I just think that it's more beneficial for people using flash based players, and only have 8 gigs to play with. Then you can use the lower bit rate, squeeze in some more tunes, and retain more of the sound quality with AAC. Considering the cost of memory and the PMP devices, there is no reason to use low-bitrate anything any more. I mean, how many songs would 4 or 8GB of flash hold at 320KB/s MP3 VBR? If you figure an average of 8MB/song (conservative estimate), that works out to 500 songs for 4GB, or 1K songs for 8GB. My 4G nano has 612 songs (or about 47 hours). The battery lasts 8-9 hours under good conditions... I knew that's why Apple was pushing so hard for DRM free tracks. It's because in one of their thinking sessions they thought of a way to get even more money out of their customers. "How can we charge our customers for music they already paid for?" I don't think most people that use iTunes and iPods would even care at this point. Most people would still want to buy the lower cost music anyway, imo. On the other hand, I think this the way Apple got around their pledge of keeping music at $.99. I know the recording industry and been trying to pressure them to raise prices, but I guess Apple told them they would have to give something more in order to get the price increase. I get the feeling it's that EMI is charging apple more per song if it's free of DRM, and with the way the RIAA has been the past few years, I think that it is extremely likely to be the case. Apple Recognized the outcry from users wanting to download DRM free music, and also wanted to stand by their $.99 per song stance, but if EMI is charging apple $1.05 per song downloaded... that simply isn't feasible. If you look into the financials of Apple, the ITunes store doesn't make a large profit for Apple compared to their other venues. I don't think it is even more then a few cents per song. AppleInsider places it at almost 10 cents per song, which I feel is a bit high; the analyst keeps assuming few people work at ITunes, and random other variables he prefers to low-ball. Anyways though, I just upgraded 25 songs for $6, most came from two albums (30 Second to Mars and MassiveAttack). I did this during lunch so only got a short time to play, but the 30 Seconds to Mars tracks sounded much cleaner/fuller then their 128 cousins (I kept both on my computer to compare); it was a noticable difference through my system. I doubt I will hear a huge difference in my headphones w/ Nano, but through the computer (XiFi-Music and a 400 watt system) it is a definite improvement. ITunes Plus purchases and upgrades are definitely my preference from here on out with ITunes. Didn't they just say they sold 2 billion songs on Itunes last year? Even at 10 cents per (seems low) that's still 200 million bucks pal... Even more important though, since it locks people into AAC format (even without DRM, AAC only plays on Ipods, Zunes (lol all 6 of them), and a handful of Sony players), it sells even more IPODS! ITunes exist to sell IPods; IPods exist to sell Apple as a whole. IPods are one of the best marketing tools we will ever see pushed out; and yes, ITunes locks you into AAC/IPods, this is the entire marketing strategy. As to the 2 billions songs, that is since ITunes bagain in April of '03 till Jan. of '07; so it took nearly 4 years to reach 2 billion (with accelerated growth towards the end). January 17, 2007âAppleÂ® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2007 first quarter ended December 30, 2006. The Company posted record revenue of $7.1 billion and record net quarterly profit of $1.0 billion, or $1.14 per diluted share pril 25, 2007âAppleÂ® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2007 second quarter ended March 31, 2007. The Company posted revenue of $5.26 billion and net quarterly profit of $770 million, or $.87 per diluted share. So lets say they sold almost 750 million songs last year (due to accelerated growth, just a shot in the dark estimate); divide by 4 for one quarter, ~187 million, down to $18.7 million in profit for the quarter estimated based on 10 cents per song. $18.7 Million is a drop in the bucket for Apple compared to a ~$885 million profit in a quarter (average of the first two). Yes, ITunes is profitable; but it is merely a marketing tool which happens to make trump change on the side. Apparently you didn't RTFA. "Applying that estimate to the $1.2 billion in revenue that iTunes is expected to generation in fiscal 2007, he believes the service will generate $0.09 to $0.14 in earnings-per-share for Apple." 1.2 billion THIS YEAR. If we assume each song is 99 cents, that's roughly... (gets out abacus, slide rule, and protractor...) 1.2 billion songs sold this year alone. So that's $168 million IN PROFIT if they estimate 9-14% profit margin (again, sounds very low, they estimated 10% in credit card fees... say what jack? I can open an account with several banks right now that only charge 2%.. how did Apple get such a lousy deal?). That's before the "subscription model" they plan to add which they estimate could add another 900 million in revenue. Being you demand we use your math and not look at what I showed, nor even argue my point, I'll use your math, okay? (I also read the article, and both quartly statements w/ press releases; and as stated before, I feel the analyst over estimated). $168 million in the year, $42 million in the quarter. Once again, it is , as previously stated, compared to Apple's profit streams which have averaged $885 million the first two quarters (less then 5%). ITunes is a marketing scheme, not a profit center for Apple; its returns are the marketing and tie-ins with IPod/Apple. Yes, Apple wants to make money off of it, but the primary return Apple cares about is the marketing/brand loyalty. Also, the credit card fees are not your APR fees like you as an individual would get. Apple, and any other company, is slammed with a percentage fee per transaction. Hence the reason why the analyst says Apple has wisened up to combine purchases so the fees are not as bad. The fees tend to be higher percentages on smaller transactions, this is why historically you would see many retail spaces with minimums for credit cards. What's to stop Creative, SanDisk etc adding AAC support to their players? Why haven't they done so already? And what's to stop people converting DRM-free AAC to MP3 to play on non-AAC players? (Type "aac to mp3 converter" in google) Or, you know, use iTunes to convert to MP3 since you need to have iTunes to buy these songs in the first place. I think some of the others (other than Zune) do support AAC. Nothing stopping Creative unless they just don't want to pay the licensing royalties. Also you CAN convert but you lose quality. It's effing amazing to me.... That after all the complaints about DRMs, Apple does something about it. They finally give the consumer what they are asking for, and still all of you "Apple Bashers" out there want to talk shit about the format, or the price, or the fact that indy distributors have been doing it for so many years. SO WHAT. This is an in-road to DRM free music on a much larger scale. Other distributors will have to follow suit. And with Apple's price being lower than the average $2 that most sites charge, it will drive the prices of the DRM free tracks down elsewhere. Use your head, and try not to jump on the "I hate Apple" bandwagon so quickly. This is a good thing. RE: It's effing amazing to me.... The reason to complain about Apple is they always do the wrong thing. First, with DRM, and now, with the wrong file format. Clearly Jobs knows the right thing to do - he just wants to string the customers along - and they also hope that by changing file formats every couple of years, then some customers will buy the same songs again in the new format. After all, consolidation onto a single file format is of no benefit to the sellers. It is much better for them to have a number of formats that need to be supported, over time. If Jobs truly "cared" about the customers as he seems to claim, he would have done the right thing in the first place. After all, why is DRM-free content commercially viable today, compared to a couple years ago? What exactly has changed? Nothing. RE: It's effing amazing to me.... Silly, you ask what's changed? 1) 100m iPods have been sold, so there is a huge installed base of receptive customers 2) 2.5b iTunes songs have been sold, so there is a huge installed base of iTunes clients and existing customers Regarding format; you champion MP3, do you also want everyone to stick to DVD instead of HD? MP3 is 10 year old technology. AAC is able to obtain higher quality at lower bitrates... important when distributing over the internet. RE: It's effing amazing to me.... My point is that nothing's changed with respect to DRM. I don't see how number of iPods and/or iTunes songs being sold has any relevance. People can "casually copy" or otherwise share music files just as easily as they could 3 years ago. RE: It's effing amazing to me.... Yet you did ask "Why is DRM content commercially viable today..."? Because Apple has sold enough tracks to show that it is commercially viable to sell music. In turn that has created the number one online retailer, enough so that they have the leverage to negotiate DRM free. Who, three years ago, had the ability to do that? Again, the number of iPods and iTunes accounts is directly responsible for giving Apple the ability to negotiate DRM free from EMI. RE: It's effing amazing to me.... Good point - you're probably right about that. RE: It's effing amazing to me.... RE: It's effing amazing to me.... why is DRM-free content commercially viable today, compared to a couple years ago? What exactly has changed? Nothing. Huh? Something monumental, something huge has changed! EMI was willing to sell their stuff w/o DRM. That's huge. And among the majors they still are the ONLY one. If apple decided to sell all their tunes w/o DRM, they'd be sued into bankruptcy in no time in a court case that'd take no time at all it'd be so clearcut. They can't "just do it", no matter what Nike might suggest. Why so expensive per song? I always thought .99 was too expensive per song, and the reason being is if I were to go buy a CD(with inserts, extras, dvd, packaging, retail shelf space, shipping, whatever else) with say 14 tracks on it, I could get it for probably a comparable price. Why aren't the savings passed on to the consumer, there's almost no overhead needed for these and yet we are still paying $1 per song. RE: Why so expensive per song? You don't think Apple has any expenses in selling you songs? How much do you pay for DSL per month? Imagine 10,000 times that (or more). Not to speak of the stuff those pipes connect to. Think they might have an IT center associated with it? How about a large crew of lawyers for all of their negotiations and lawsuits against them (don't think that we don't pay for all the lawsuits against them!). All those nice Apple showtime events in the Moscone center (or whatever) the tremendous bills for those weren't given by the Gates foundation. Oh, companies like EMI, the artists, etc might want some money too. They've got to pay their lawyers as well. P.S. - To mention a long ago thread, they also have to have one of these iTune stores for each country in the EU (recall that the EU was getting them for doing that even though their music company "suppliers" required it of them contractually). The total numbers thrown around would be global. Japan probably doesn't use the same iTune store as the U.S. does either. So they've probably server centers all over the world along with each one's staff and bills that run the place and lawyers for each country, etc. Somebody has to pay for all of that. I recall reports that they don't make much on their iTunes store, it's mostly a reason for people to buy iPods which is where they make the big bucks. RE: Why so expensive per song? Unless you think Apple's data center is more expensive than a chain of B&M stores that have to be shipped physical products, I don't see your point. Having separate "stores" for every EU country costs then tens of man-hours and multiple watts of electricity I'm sure, but is certaily cheaper than actually opening stores there. 9.99 an album is a discount over CDs. 0.99/1.29 a song is a markup for not buying filler tracks. Since I find physical CDs more of a hindrance than a benefit, I see it as a good deal (at least relative to CDs.) RE: Why so expensive per song? I see what you are saying, but I mean I can get a CD without DRM on it and convert it to any file type I want, put it on any number of devices, etc. If you want to you can throw away the cd and stuff when you are done and still save money. I understand apple has costs associated with this, but it seems to my relatively untrained eye that prices are still comparable to cd's, and if this is the case what's the point? Markup for filler tracks seems like a pretty lame idea on their(apple/record companies) parts to me. RE: Why so expensive per song? I save even more money by NOT buying a whole CD. I usually buy anywhere from one to three songs from a CD. That's it. And if I want the whole album then I MIGHT buy the CD IF it's the same price or cheaper than the iTunes version AND I just happen to be at the store to get something else. I don't make special trips for music. It's a waste of gas and time. I can download a song at anytime even at work. $3 vs $10. Hmmmmm. Even at $3.87 for the non-DRM versions, it's STILL cheaper than buying the CD. RE: Why so expensive per song? Ebay ftw... Save money and get the most out of your music. I've purchased many cd's on ebay and paid like 1/4 of the price. RE: Why so expensive per song? Of course a major pure play in music stores, Tower Records, went bankrupt trying to sell in stores. Not sure if that's a shining example for low cost delivery of goods. Stores that sell music in addition to other things makes it hard to tell how well their music sales are going. In any case, financial reports that apple puts out say (to my recollection) that they don't make much profit from iTune sales. How does one explain that if they're making too high of a margin on their sales? RE: Why so expensive per song? Another opinion - the price is too high, I don't volunteer to pay more for a product to support populating the earth with stores or any of their other overheads. In the end it's the same situation as any other reseller, any other product. Some will feel the price is too high and they either lower that price or lose the sale. No, somebody doesn't have to pay for all that. It could be avoided by cutting out the fat. I don't know what's worse... Guess what? No DRM; but they embed your account information onto the track. This is no milestone. It's like you're paying 30% more for compatibility. I still wouldn't buy it. I'd rather buy an real CD. RE: I don't know what's worse... ^-- the real reason Apple uses AAC instead of MP3 RE: I don't know what's worse... Which will disappear once you convert it to MP3. Next. RE: I don't know what's worse... Which will degrade the sound quality of the product which you are now paying MORE for. Great idea. RE: I don't know what's worse... Embedding the owner's name in the track allows the Fair Use applications that people *claim* they want to have while providing tracebility for the illegal sharing that people *claim* they are not interested in. Also, you're paying 30% more for an open format with *twice* the bitrate.

While the phrase "offline web" may seem like an oxymoron, it speaks directly to the goal of Google Gears, which is to increase access to data and applications even when there is no Internet connection available. Google's announcement indicates that Google Gears is a browser extension that is being "made available in its early states so that everyone can test its capabilities and limitations and help improve upon it". In addition, Google is proposing that this concept evolve into a "single standard for offline capabilities that all developers can use". has already implemented Google Gears and as a result is offering offline capabilities.

PSP upgraded to 3.50 Sony's PlayStation Portable gets a firmware update to enable remote PS3 viewing. am PT Last week, PlayStation 3 was released, which enabled a variety of extra features for the console including adding the Remote Play ability--anyone with a PSP could then access their PS3 over the Internet. Now a firmware update for the PSP to 3.50 updates the handheld to be Remote Play ready too. Owners of both gaming machines won't be able to access DVD or Blu-ray movies or play PS3 games from their handhelds, but they will be able to access music, other videos, pictures, and their friends lists. Firmware update 3.50 also adds a RSS channel guide for PSP owners who use their portables to receive news and other RSS feeds. &laquo; Back to Today's News to post a comment on this story! I forgot I have a PSP am PT to rate this comment Javier am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) for god sakes there are a ton of good games for the psp so the ds fanboys should really shut the hell up already. not to mention that the psp is the most usefull portable device you can buy anyways, if you couldnt even play games on it at all it would still be an awesome machine. this fanboy bull#$%* really gets on my nerves. either way, most ds games are for kids 12 and under. am PT to rate this comment JEEBUS_BOGONDO am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) jus more room wasted on my default memory card lol am PT to rate this comment faceman420 am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) SWEET...

Network games funner and bigger? Please - that is flat out a lie. There is nothing really out for the PS3 yet to make it a must have. I have one, but I feel like I wasted my money. Also, I do not see why remote play is a BIG deal. Who uses it that much? Who would want to leave their PS3 running non-stop? For those of you that do not know it will shorten the lie spand of your console. I love my PSP, but really remote play is just ugh crap. am PT to rate this comment joejoe160 am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) Sounds awesome, but I don't have a PS3 or Wi-fi. am PT to rate this comment Darkside2501 am PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) Meh, not much of an update.

Panoramio has worked hand in hand with Google for a long time, but, on Wednesday evening, the relationship became more of a hand within hand sort of thing as Google acquired the company. Panoramio &ldquo;is a website that enables digital photographers to geolocate, store and organize their photographs - and to view those photographs in Google Earth and Google Maps,&rdquo; as explained by a statement from Google. The acquisition won&rsquo;t change any of that; Panoramio will continue to be a default layer in Yet, presumably because of the privacy concerns that pop up whenever Google is involved, users are being provided with the opportunity to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of the acquisition. Users who don&rsquo;t choose this option - or who do nothing at all - will, at the close of the deal, have their Panoramio-related data and photos transferred to the search engine giant. The acquisition will, however, &ldquo;bring many advantages to Panoramio users, starting with a better infrastructure to improve the reliability of Panoramio, more frequent updates of Panoramio&rsquo;s Google Earth layer, and more resources for some invisible tasks that take time out from working on new features,&rdquo; according to &ldquo;Jos&eacute;, Joaqu&iacute;n and Eduardo&rdquo; - Panoramio&rsquo;s three . (Joaqu&iacute;n and Eduardo are actually co-founders.) One last note - even as the $75 million deal between eBay and StumbleUpon is confirmed, we&rsquo;ve been left in the dark about the financial details of the Google-Panoramio acquisition. The terms were not disclosed, but, according to , the company was &ldquo;very (and we mean very) happy&rdquo; about the takeover. Doug is a staff writer for for the latest eBusiness news.

The former covers a situation that could potentially have led to the execution of arbitrary code, but it seems there are no known exploits so far. The latter is a script injection vulnerability. Less serious bugs allowed a denial of service attack via the autocomplete feature, a pair of cookie handling problems, and the ability to spoof browser chrome such as the location bar via XUL popups.

Atlantis returns to pad Two months after rolling off the launch pad to seek repairs to the hail-damaged external fuel tank, space shuttle Atlantis returns to pad 39A for mission STS-117. Cosmonauts take spacewalk outside space station MISSION CONTROL STATUS REPORT Posted: May 30, 2007 Two International Space Station cosmonauts stepped outside Wednesday for a 5-hour, 25-minute spacewalk, installing Service Module Debris Protection panels and rerouting a Global Positioning System antenna cable. Wearing Russian Orlan spacesuits, Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and Flight Engineer Oleg Kotov began their spacewalk from the Russian Pirs airlock at 3:05 p.m. EDT. The spacewalk was scheduled to begin at 2:20 p.m., but was delayed due to time required to troubleshoot a communications problem. First, the cosmonauts moved to the Strela 2, one of the hand-operated, telescoping cranes at the base of Pirs. They attached an extension to the Strela boom, increasing its reach from 45 to 60 feet. With Kotov on the end of the extension, Yurchikhin extended the boom to a point over Pressurized Mating Adapter 3, or PMA-3, on the Unity connecting node. Once in place, Yurchikhin, with guidance from Kotov, maneuvered the Strela end effector to a grapple fixture on an adapter stowage rack. The adapter is attached to PMA-3 and held three bundles of 17 debris panels. The assembly is dubbed the "Christmas Tree." Once the Christmas Tree was attached to the Strela and released from PMA-3, Yurchikhin moved it and Kotov back to the small diameter of the Zvezda Module. Yurchikhin joined Kotov there, and together they secured it to a grapple fixture on Zvezda. Next, they left the debris panel task and moved aft onto Zvezda's large conical section. There they rerouted a cable for a Global Positioning System to be used for future rendezvous operations with the European Automated Transfer Vehicle. The ATV is an unpiloted cargo carrier with almost twice the capacity of the Progress cargo craft. It is scheduled to make its first launch later this year. Once that task was completed, the cosmonauts moved back to the Christmas Tree on the forward end of Zvezda, where they removed and opened one of the three bundles of debris panels. That bundle held five panels. The aluminum panels vary in size but are about an inch thick. They typically measure about 2 by 3 feet and weigh 15 to 20 pounds. Yurchikhin and Kotov installed the five panels on Zvezda's forward section, the area between Zvezda's large and small diameters. After the installation task, the spacewalkers moved back to Pirs and into the airlock. Hatch closure marking the end of the spacewalk was at 8:30 p.m. EDT. This was the first spacewalk for Yurchikhin and Kotov. On their second, scheduled for June 6, the remaining 12 debris panels will be installed on Zvezda. Additionally, the cosmonauts also will install a section of an Ethernet cable on the Zarya module and a Russian experiment called Biorisk on Pirs. The three bundles and their adapter were delivered by space shuttle Discovery during the STS-116 mission in December 2006 and attached to PMA-3 by spacewalkers Bob Curbeam and Sunita Williams. Williams, an Expedition 15 crew member, remained aboard the station as the intravehicular officer for Wednesday's spacewalk, advising and keeping the spacewalkers on schedule. Six debris panels were previously installed during an August 2002 spacewalk by Expedition 5 Commander Valery Korzun and Flight Engineer Peggy Whitson. Those panels were delivered to the station by space shuttle Endeavour during the STS-111 mission in June 2002. This is the official astronaut patch of space shuttle Endeavour's STS-118 mission to the International Space Station.

Apple launched iTunes Plus with a menu of EMI Group music including songs from Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, Frank Sinatra, John Coltrane, Pink Floyd, and Paul McCartney. Songs cost US&#036;1.29 each, 30 cents more than standard iTunes offerings, but are "virtually indistinguishable from original recordings" and aren't fettered by Digital Rights Management (DRM) software that blocks copying, Apple said. "Our customers are very excited about the freedom and amazing sound quality of iTunes Plus," Apple chief executive Steve Jobs said in a release. "We expect more than half of the songs on iTunes will be offered in iTunes Plus versions by the end of this year." Jobs denounced digital rights management software in February in an open letter calling on the music recording industry to abandon the practice of insisting it be incorporated into digital music sold online. Major recording studios fired back that the safeguard is needed to prevent pirates from making myriad unauthorised copies and denying owners their due payments for music. Cupertino, California-based Apple and EMI, based in Britain, formed an alliance in April to sell DRM-free music. "This is a tremendous milestone for digital music," EMI Group chief executive Eric Nicoli said of the new iTunes offering. "Consumers are going to love listening to higher quality iTunes Plus tracks from their favourite EMI artists with no usage restrictions." The removal of DRM software means that for the first time, music bought at iTunes can be played on rival MP3 players, including Microsoft's Zune.

PSP 3.50 firmware available: "Remote Play" over the Internet Posted May 31st 2007 4:26AM by Just released in Japan, Sony's 3.50 firmware for the should making the global rounds soon enough. That, coupled with the latest PS3 firmware update, means you've just scored "Remote Play" functionality -- access to videos, music, and pictures on your home PS3 running -- over the Internet. In other words, you can stream media but can't actually play games remotely. The update also includes an RSS Channel Guide but we know it's the remote play you want. The new firmware should already be available via your PSP's Network Update option even though many of Sony's download sites are still pegged at version 3.40. Sony's 1.80 PS3 firmware enables 1080p upscaling for games and movies (8 days ago - 50 Comments) PSP hardware refresh coming this year, says report (14 days ago - 37 Comments) Sony announces PSP Go!Cam for PAL regions (30 days ago - 12 Comments) Sony PSP goes Champagne Gold (141 days ago - 29 Comments) Lik-Sang.com shut down by Sony lawsuits (219 days ago - 113 Comments) Subscribe to these comments (Page 1 of 1) May 31st 2007 4:31AM The headline says PSP 1.80 firmware... should be PS3... May 31st 2007 4:34AM meh, it's actually supposed to read 3.50. Thanks. View Comment in Thread May 31st 2007 5:49AM DarkAlex's OE in 3... 2... 1... May 31st 2007 7:25AM Now someone has to incorporate RemotePlay into MythTV May 31st 2007 7:36AM I'm downloading it now... in the US. May 31st 2007 7:40AM Wow, finally someone on the Engadget team who can spell Internet right. May 31st 2007 8:08AM I don't understand this. Does your PS3 have to remain ON and sucking power all the time in case you may want to access a few short videos? Why not upload them to Youtube instead? Then you'll be able to access them from anything, and not just a PSP and you won't have to leave your PS3 on all the time. May 31st 2007 8:19AM Can a PSP watch videos on YOUTUBE? View Comment in Thread May 31st 2007 8:41AM im still waiting to see if Joost would work on psp!!! May 31st 2007 8:57AM Kamalot: YouTube does not work on my psp... I won't be accessing a few short videos, my brother has a psp and lives 100 miles away, this way he can view files i upload on my ps3, i.e family home videos and more. He can also check out files on my pc through the media server. I'm not bothered about playing ps3 games on the psp, if it could do that.. i'd be worried about how i supposedly bought "advanced technology" when the psp can render the games. By the way.. downloaded it and it works great! May 31st 2007 9:39AM So you can access your media server as well from your PSP through the PS3? Awesome. View Comment in Thread May 31st 2007 9:41AM I wouldn't need to render the graphics, it would just stream the video. Like when you watch an animated movie like "Toy Story", you aren't actually rendering the graphics. May 31st 2007 10:03AM Awesome! Can't wait to get home and fire my PSP up. The promise of this type of functionality was one of the reasons I bought my PSP and PS3. How cool is it to be able to pull up family photos, home movies, and music from a world away. May 31st 2007 10:45AM The PS3 and PSP shared remote play capabilities since the last update. The only difference I noticed with 1.8 is that my PSP connected on the first try as opposed to the second. May 31st 2007 10:57AM Got mine to work installing TVersity & ffmpeg on my PC. Xvid movies on PC -> PS3 -> internet -> on my PSP via WiFi May 31st 2007 11:24AM Downloaded it and it works GREAT, nice little update. Now what they need to do is add "Wake on Lan" and sleep mode to the PS3. This way I can put my PS3 to sleep and it wakes up when I connect to it with my PSP. May 31st 2007 11:47AM Wake On LAN and auto sleep mode were supposed to be included with the release. I take it they weren't? Man, I wish I wasn't at work right now...

As was the case when Dell opted for AMD, it's big industry news anytime a major PC manufacturers diverges from an Intel-only strategy. For AMD, the big challenge remains making such market advances stick, as opposed to the two-steps forward, one-step backwards dance it's been doing for the past few years. First the specific news, and it's pretty succinct: Toshiba will launch three Satellite laptops using AMD's dual-core mobile Turion 64 X2 processor and AMD's M690 core-logic chipset. The notebooks will hit first in the United States and Europe. More interesting is the timing of this announcement. It seems to cement the perception that AMD is about to rebound from its recent bout of bad news. As VARBusiness's Shelley Solheim explains in her fine piece, AMD Attempts To Rebound From Its Short Circuit , the scrappy chipmaker is reeling from a big financial loss earlier this year as well as a drop in its market share. Mostly, AMD has been hurt by a . After several years of missteps, Intel CEO Paul Otellini has gotten the company back on track. Intel's Core 2 Duo line successful beat back AMD's early lead in dual-core technology. On the quad-core front, Intel was ahead of AMD. Now, Intel is expected to be first with 45-nm chip technology. Still, AMD has got a potent quad-core architecture of its own in the works, in the form of its upcoming Phenom desktop quad and "Barcelona" server processor. Since 2003, when AMD released its AMD64 architecture, and then the associated Opteron and Athlon processor families, the question has never been about the company's technology. Instead, it's about the survival of a smaller company in the face of an increasingly competitive business, against a far larger rival. Intel's sheer heft gives it the ability to ride out tough business environments and the occasional technological misstep. AMD doesn't have such luxuries. How the quad-core race and the shift to 45-nm processes play out will ultimately have more to say about the long-term fate of AMD than today's Toshiba news, however welcome that may be. &laquo; The Walrus Bucket Internet Meme, Seriously Microsoft Cancels PDC...

Now the search giant wants to actively recruit the geek elite of software programmers. On Thursday, the company will host its first , attracting 5,000 people to 10 locations around the world, including the San Jose Convention Center in California. The conference is part of a company goal is to cultivate a better relationship with programmers, particularly those on the cutting edge of , a relatively new style of application development that combines information from different Web sites. In conjunction with the conference, the company on Wednesday announced , a Web browser plug-in that allows Web developers to add offline access to Web applications. Google Gears is part of the company's strategy to in order to make Web applications more capable--a goal that it is taking substantial steps to achieve, particularly for a company whose primary business is online search. The company employs some of the key engineers in open-source software projects, including Linux kernel contributor Andrew Morton, and gives outside developers access to its services, often for free. Employees even write , released with liberal copyright and usage terms, to make the lives of Web developers easier. Although not always obvious, these programs feed into its overall business strategy. From Google's point of view, the more good Web applications, the better. "If the apps that show up in Google search results are more dynamic and more appealing, people will do more searches and be on the Web more," said Bret Taylor, group product manager for Google's developer products. "Because the Web is Google's , we're interested in improving it as much as we can." By giving developers access to its services through application programming interfaces (APIs), Google relies on third parties to extend what it offers. An application that displays Google calendar information on a mobile phone, which is not something Google engineers had done, is apt to drive more usage of that calendar. As Web applications become more functional, developer programs have become , eBay, Microsoft and , which itself first hosted a Hack Day for developers last fall. An active "ecosystem," or network, of partners creating linked services drives traffic--and revenue--to the hosting site while extending their offerings. Take our building blocks, please During the Developer Day keynote speeches, Google executives will describe how the company's developer program is organized to promote creation of mashups. In addition to California, conferences are being held in London; Paris; Madrid; Moscow; Sydney; Beijing; Yokyo; Sao Paolo, Brazil; and Hamburg, Germany. They will outline the two types of "building block" services the company intends to release: those that extend Google services and those that developers can use as part of their own applications. For example, Google Maps is a popular component for building completely new applications that plot information from one source, such as customers or hiking locations, on a Web map. Meanwhile, the Google Gadgets API lets third parties build mini-applications that reside within--and enhance--the Google home page or Google Desktop. "These developers are generating a just huge amount of traffic for their own services by developing these gadgets," Blake said. "In return, though, Google's personalized home page is only good because of the outside developers who make it good." Similarly, tools like Google Gears, available as open source, enhance Ajax development and encourage people to use the browser as the center point of computing, Blake said. Its goal is to make Ajax style development, which doesn't require proprietary plug-ins like Flash or Silverlight, as capable as possible, he said. Open source plays a big role at Google and its developer program. Chris DiBona, the open-source programs manager at Google, will deliver talks at the London edition of Developer Day where he plans to discuss the Google's activities in open source. Google is a high-profile user of several open-source products, including a variant of Linux used in its Engineers participate in open-source projects for products they use, but beyond that, Google wants to promote the underlying ethic of open source, DiBona said. "One of the reasons that I think open source is popular as it is is because it gives the customer, the developer, leverage again. They're not held hostage and not being locked in," he said. "We want to express that kind of idealism through our interfaces and open-source software has shown us the way to do that." As Google releases more APIs for its products, it will try to make them "as open as possible" by providing documentation and technical specifications for protocols, as it did with Sitemap protocol, which makes sites easier for search engines to crawl. Being as open as possible with development technology helps promote creation of good applications and a positive end-user experience on the Web, DiBona said. Adopting open-source practices with its developer products like Google Gears and APIs also allows Google to upgrade more rapidly and, as a company, keep moving fast, DiBona said. Changes in APIs can break mashup applications; an open-source "ethic" allows the company to make upgrades, he argued. In theory, other companies could serve customers who wanted to stick with older versions of Google APIs, he said. More importantly, the ability to upgrade quickly means "we're constantly trying to sell the upgrade...One of the things we really don't want to do is we don't want to slow down Google," DiBona said.

Google to Buy Panoramio Google is acquiring Panoramio, a photo sharing site that lets user upload photos and identify where they were taken. Part 1 of a special five-part series. James Niccolai, IDG News Service Thursday, AM PDT Google Inc. is acquiring Panoramio, a photo-sharing Web site based in Spain that lets people upload photos and identify where they were taken by placing them on Google Earth or Google Maps, where they can be viewed by the public. The companies have already been working together since the start of the year, when Google made Panoramio the default photo layer for Google Earth. Panoramio has seen its usage surge since then, recently passing 1 million "geo-located" photos. In a blog posting Wednesday, Google said it was buying the company to integrate its services more closely with its own -- although it isn't saying exactly how yet -- and to boost its own technical resources. It should also help to strengthen Panoramio's infrastructure, leading to more reliable service for end users. Financial terms of the acquisition, which is pending, were not disclosed. Google said it planned to keep operating the site for now and that there won't be any immediate changes for Panoramio's users. The move should help to strengthen Google's position against Yahoo Inc. for providing online photo services. Yahoo owns the popular Flickr photo-sharing service, whose users can also locate their photos on Google Earth, although they don't appear as the default layer. Panoramio said it was "very (and we mean very) happy" to be acquired by Google. "To watch our little project grow since its conception one and a half years ago has been an amazing experience," cofounder Eduardo Manchsn wrote in a blog posting. Panoramio was launched in October 2005. About 300,000 people had signed up for the service as of March this year, and in February the site had 4 million unique visitors and 30 million page views, according to Panoramio. The company released an API (application programming interface) recently that lets other Web sites include Panoramio functionality in their site. It gave its users the option to remove all their photos and personal data before they are transferred to Google. / 1000 max characters MySpace&#039;s Parent to Buy Photobucket Google Revamps Korean Site Cisco Completes WebEx Buy FTC Investigating Google-DoubleClick Deal Google Buys Security Software Maker BMC to Buy ProactiveNet Prepare for Mobile Security Threats Conditions are right for mobile security threats to start overwhelming businesses and consumers in North America.

Fatdoor: Social Networking for Real Communities Fatdoor social network mirrors the real world to let users connect with neighbors and local businesses. Part 1 of a special five-part series. Thursday, AM PDT Fatdoor.com, a Web site that mirrors the real world to let users to connect with their neighbors, launched Tuesday with a new spin on social networking. Instead of anonymous interaction, Fatdoor lets users communicate directly with local neighbors and businesses, said Raj Abhyanker, CEO and co-founder of the company. Abhyanker launched the company with Chandu Thota, who was the lead developer for Microsoft Corp.'s Virtual Earth mapping and location tool. Bill Harris, the former CEO of PayPal Inc. and Intuit Inc., is an investor and chairman of the company. "We're trying to build something on the Internet that mirrors the real world," Harris said. "We call it a local community network. It is a social network that is based around the place you live and the ... people you know. It is not an anonymous activity; this is a social network for adults." Abhyanker said he came up with the idea while running for the city council of Cupertino, Calif., in 2005. After knocking on 3,000 doors as part of his canvassing, he noticed that most people didn't know their neighbors. He said he began thinking about how to use the Web to "enhance neighborhoods, to give the power to the few who are very active to use for the common benefit of all neighbors." The first release of Fatdoor is open to residents of Silicon Valley, with later releases expanding the site cities and towns throughout the U.S. The site was built using Virtual Earth maps, showing specific house and businesses as icons. The icons can be "claimed" by users to hold their online profiles, which can be viewed by others in the neighborhood looking for specific services, to start a club or for other purposes, Abhyanker said. As users add content, their neighbors can learn about local events or business deals, he added. The goal is to foster a group of active users in the neighborhood who can self-regulate content using the Wikipedia model. Eventually, Abhyanker said, Fatdoor could be used by community activists or civic groups for various projects, such as producing a neighborhood newspaper, he added. Harris said the business model for Fatdoor calls for the site to eventually be supported by national and local advertisers eager to target users in specific locations. The site will first list all businesses in the local Yellow Pages and then allow each of those companies to personalize the listings, he said. Users can then add reviews and comments about the businesses. For more enterprise computing news, visit . Story copyright &copy; 2007 Computerworld Inc.

The whales began following two tugboats that are headed out of the port and toward the Pacific Ocean. As of Sunday afternoon, the whales had moved about five miles closer to the ocean. The California Highway Patrol urged people to stay away from the area where the whales had been circling, but for a sixth day in a row, thousands showed up. About 10,000 people have turned out thus far to watch the whales, officials said. The CHP recommended if people do drive to Sacramento, they should bring water and a lot of patience due to the big crowds. Scientists have been planning to resume efforts Tuesday to lure the pair back to the Pacific Ocean by using dozens of boats and noises of pipes banging underwater to corral the whales back toward the ocean. Lt. Gov. John Garamendi said Friday at a news conference he was naming the whales Delta and Dawn, after the Helen Reddy song. Garamendi said the name Delta came from the body of water the whales are lost in and Dawn because it brings in a new day. On Friday, for the second straight day, a marine mammal rescue crew aboard a Coast Guard cutter played recorded sounds of other humpbacks feeding to the mother whale and calf stranded at the Port of Sacramento, where the two hit a dead-end after traveling 90 miles through San Francisco Bay and up the Sacramento River. The whales were not responding to the sounds, but a similar recording procedure worked in 1985 with a humpback nicknamed Humphrey, which swam in the delta for nearly a month before returning to the Pacific. However, biologists said the situation facing them near Sacramento is more complicated. It involves a mother and calf, rather than a single whale, that are much farther into the delta than Humphrey was. The injuries add another dimension, as scientists say they do not know how the wounds might affect the whales' behavior. "It's brand-new territory. It's not like we're applying something we have a lot of experience with in the past. It's essentially an experiment," said Pieter Folkens, a biologist with the Alaska Whale Foundation who was part of the rescue effort. "We really can't have high expectations of a positive outcome. We're certainly doing our best." Meanwhile, the rescue efforts are taking place inside a very industrial port, where business operations continue. "The current vessel in port now is the Jin Quan, unloading 31,000 tons of bulk cement. They're scheduled to complete operations on Tuesday at which time they'd like to depart," Mike Luken with the Port of Sacramento said. There is another ship scheduled to come in that same day, which gives all the more reason why rescuers are hoping their sound experiments will be successful. "We want to be as careful and as cautionary as possible because we really do not want to stress the mother or calf in any way because they are compromised by the injuries." Biologists hope to get the whales back into the ocean, where food is more plentiful and the salt water can heal their cuts, apparently inflicted by a boat propeller when the mammals were in the river. The failure of attempts to use whale sounds could be related to the recordings used. They were of Alaskan whales that might be part of a different pod than the one the mother and calf belong to. "This is a humpback probably from a different population, probably the Mexico-California population," Folkens said. "So it's kind of like speaking Chinese to somebody from Boston, but at least you recognize that it might be another member of the same species." The good news on Friday was that biologists did not detect any significant changes in their health from a day earlier, Gulland said. "Both mother and calf are still swimming and breathing and surfacing at similar rates as they were over the past few days," she said. Even if the recordings eventually work, scientists said it could take anywhere from several days to several weeks to lure the whales back to the bay.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/0-6&fd=R&url=http://www.slashgear.com/jeff-hawkins-on-the-palm-foleo-315513.php&cid=1116814949&ei=muxeRqqvDIX20AHe4M3QDQ Jeff Hawkins on the Palm Foleo - SlashGear Jeff Hawkins on the Palm Foleo Thursday, May 31st 2007 by Palm just finished up their webcast a little while ago, and after seeing what it can do and how easy it is to use, I may have to get one of these when they come out. I&#8217;ll give you the highlights of the webcast. Jeff Hawkins, founder of Palm talked at length about the overall focus of the company. 15 years ago they started Palm with the idea that the future was in mobile computing. They wanted to build a device that could do many of the same functions that a desktop or laptop computer could do, but small enough to fit into your pocket. They started off small by finding a market to which they could appeal. They found that niche with the Palm Pilot as a mobile organizer. Their thought was that they could appeal to a market, then let their product grow. The Palm Pilot eventually evolved into the Treo which incorporated a phone into the organizer, and let you do more of the basic computing functions. The Foleo represents the next step Palm is taking to bring the computer down to a mobile size. Again they&#8217;ve decided to cater to a specific crowd. They are targeting users that are looking for mobile mail and web browsing, but want a larger screen and a full-size keyboard. But there is plenty of room for the Foleo to grow into much more than just an email machine. The biggest features of the Foleo are the small size, full keyboard and instant-on technology. The device is only as wide as the keyboard itself to allow for the smallest possible size. This allows for a 10â screen which at a resolution of 1024 x 600 should be more than adequate for use. It has built-in WiFi and Bluetooth to keep you connected to your phone and the internet. Even with WiFi turned on, you should be able to use it for 5 hours without needing to recharge it. What really sets this apart from other mobile solutions is the instant-on function. This is not a suspended state or a sleep mode, in fact the Foleo has only two modes: on and off. So every time you press the power button, it will instantly turn on or off, no waiting. You don&#8217;t have to worry about saving what you&#8217;re doing, you can just shut the lid and go. Next time you press the power button it will be exactly where it was when you closed it. The device looks very sleek when closed, you only have ports on one side, all three of the other sides are smooth, you&#8217;ll only see the word Palm on the top of the case, otherwise it is very smooth all around. As for the ports you will see the VGA port, a USB port, an SD slot for expansion, a headphone jack and a place to plug in the power adapter. The Foleo is Linux-based, so you have the option to switch to the terminal at any time. This also means that the software is open-source and they are encouraging people to write their own software for it. They will be making the full SDK available at launch. They feel that if you give users all of the tools, they will surprise you will cool stuff. For the web browser they have chosen to use Opera, and Versamail and Pocket Outlook will be used for email. You can view flash videos, but unfortunately you won&#8217;t be able to see YouTube videos at this time. He did mention that they are currently working on support for them. You will also be able to open and edit Word and Excel documents on it, as well as view PDF files and PowerPoint presentations. Setup is a breeze, it&#8217;s only a four-step process. You pretty much just select the model of phone you have and what carrier you use, then it starts syncing your files. At this time it only syncs your email, attachments, folders and contacts, but support for other files can be added in the future. When asked what phones the Foleo supports he stated that out of the box the Treo line will work, as will most Windows Mobile phones, though he did warn that they have not had the opportunity to test all Windows Mobile phones on the market. He also included that they hope to include support for other platforms including RIM and Symbian and if Apple were to open up the phone to 3rd-party applications they would make it compatible with the iPhone as well. If you haven&#8217;t heard already, Steve Jobs announced today that they would in fact allow 3rd party apps to work in the future. So we should be able to assume that it will be able to work with the iPhone at some point. At the end of the broadcast he took a few questions, most of the information I&#8217;ve already covered, but an interesting point that was discussed is security. You can password protect the Foleo, however, it diminishes the instant-on feature. A feature that he touched briefly on was using your phone as a key, so that as long as your phone is within range of a Bluetooth connection, you wouldn&#8217;t need a password, otherwise you would. Now that is cool. One of the best questions was why I would want a Foleo rather than a laptop? Several times during the webcast Hawkins said that the Foleo is not a laptop replacement. It is targeted at people that want something small to check email and browse with. Right now if you want something this size to do those things you&#8217;d have to pay a hefty premium to get a full-featured laptop. You&#8217;ll only pay $499 for the Foleo after a $100 rebate, that&#8217;s cheap. He then went on to state that over time it may evolve into something that is more of a laptop replacement, but for now that&#8217;s not what they are aiming for. Neat, can the Folio connect to the internet via the bluetooth connection to your cell phone? This would give the user greater ability to be on-line anywhere a phone works. It&#8217;s the price MS&#8217; Origami couldn&#8217;t hack &#8212; sans touchscreen or tablet wow factors, but with the form factor and the connectivity, with some less convergence, but on the whole: so much more marketable, so much more practical. On balance this could support a lot of mobile productivity formerly chained to bloated or otherwise crippled Windows devices. It&#8217;s a flipstart, it&#8217;s a smartphone, I can barely type on it and its battery is running out. MS? next offers a $5,000 to $10,000 touchscreen table? Push the boundaries (I write from a tablet pc) but be practical. This could be it. Nice review too, btw. BG That&#8217;s a load of crock; Palm started up because Newtons were too expensive. And the more I look at this thing, the more I see a Psion Series 5mx, copied by someone who couldn&#8217;t figure out the clever Psion hinges. And by not including Symbian (oh, the irony!) on startup, he shrewdly reduced the Fooleo&#8217;s potential market share by three quarters. Please beware about quality. I have used Palm since Palm III. This one works. Palm m515 works. Palm Tungsten died on me after 1.5 years. Palm TX purchased in April 2007 died in 2 days. Second Palm TX purchased in April 2007 died at the end of May 2007. I refuse to send my Palms to the factory for repairing because I have sensitive information on them. It is impossible to turn them on. It is impossible to perform hard reset. Palm&#8217;s policy and technology(?) does not permit to remove memory. Amazon reimbursed me for the the first TX when I explained the situation. (Please notice how good the customer support can be!) I try now to get similar resolution with the Corporate Headquarters of Palm. If they will be cooperative, I let you know. However, so far I have 3 dead bricks. I was surprised that Palm did not permit to remove flash memory. More than that, memory must be removable on all modern PDA. At that time, by analogy with blue screen of death for Windows, I suggest black screen of death for Palm. If Foleo has no memory, if this is just a convenient window to the Internet, if I can use it to operate a remote computer, multiple Google applications, print or download files through other media, that may be cool. At least they will be able to repair this device after it breaks. Foleo is DOA. Do you realize they introduced the LifeDrive almost exactly 2 years ago. I have one. I am steamed that it&#8217;s not even supported any longer. I too have a dead Tungsten. I&#8217;m pretty sure Palm will follow in the footsteps of its products.

Video aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis during re-entry NASAs new Orion launch pad may include roller coaster escape system NASAs FUSE finds two stars merging into one SuperStar Space station crew prepare for spacewalks on May 30th and June 6th NASA Ames intends to (virtually) Beam All of Us Up, Scotty! The May 30th spacewalk is being shown live on The hatch on the Russian Pirs docking compartment was opened at 3:05 p.m. EDT., about 45 minutes later than scheduled. A few problems occurred in the preparations for the spacewalk. U.S. flight engineer Sunita Williams, who is not one of the spacewalkers, worked on some of these problems. She is advising and helping with the activities of her two fellow space travelers. She is officially called the intravehicular officer for the event. Yuchikhin will be wearing a Russian Orlan spacesuit with red stripes (designated EV1) and Kotov will wear the same type of Russian suit but with blue stripes (designated EV2). Seventeen aluminum protective panels were left outside of the Space Station in an adaptive assembly nicknamed the &ldquo;Christmas tree&rdquo;. They are officially called the Service Module Debris Protection (SMDP) panels. The SMDP panels will be installed on the Zvezda Service Module (ZSM). The panels are about 2 feet by 3 feet in dimensions and weight (on Earth) about 20 pounds. They will help protect the ISS from small- and medium-sized space debris, such as natural occurring micro-meteoroids and artificially made pieces from launch vehicles. As of 5:22 p.m. CDT, the spacewalking cosmonauts have just repaired a GPS (global positioning system) navigation antenna that was broken. The GPS antenna will be used with the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), an unmanned cargo vehicle scheduled to arrive for its maiden visit to the International Space Station later in 2007. During their spacewalks, the two cosmonauts will also place canisters containing biological experiments from the Earth outside the Space Station. The future June 6th spacewalk, which begins at about 10:30 a.m., will also be shown live on beginning at 10 a.m. EDT.

The announcement was made by John Hanke, Google's director for Maps, Earth and Local, on the Google corporate blog. Terms of the deal were not announced. "We've been working with Panoramio for some time -- its photos have been a default layer in Google Earth since the beginning of the year," Hanke said. "This layer will remain in place as our teams work together toward further integrating this amazing content, generated by many, into our mapping technologies." 's key technology is its ability to allow users to "geolocate" pictures that they took, allowing them to position them on a map. In this case, the default map that the company has used has been Google Maps. The site also allows users to store and organize their pictures, similar to many other photo-sharing sites on the Web. For that reason, Google said the company was as interested in Panoramio's technology as it was its user base. "The acquisition of Panoramio will incorporate that website, its underlying technology, its content, developers, and user community into the Google Geo product mix," according to a Q&A posted to the Google site. "Panoramio will add interesting, useful content to Google products and will bolster Google's engineering and technical resources. New 'Google Gears' Allows Offline Web Apps Google Acquires Web Security Startup GreenBorder FTC to Review Google-DoubleClick Deal Google, Microsoft Mapping Software Gets Real Google: We Hold Data for Two Years For Panoramio, the company said it wanted to tie itself closer to Google. "Although the integration is already in place and functioning, we believed a deeper relationship would add value to the Panoramio experience for our users," the Google Q&A said, apparently attributing the comment to Panoramio executives. Passwords, under information, and other details will remain intact and unchanged throughout the transition, the companies said. Users will also have an option to opt out of the merger, although doing so will delete their content and user information from the Panoramio site. the acquisition of GreenBorder , which it will use to enhance its security offerings.

In an article published in BusinessWeek, Zemlin states that Microsoft is engaging in a scare campaign against all those potential users wanting to shift from Windows to Linux operating system. "Let's face it: If you were making $1 billion per month, what would you do? Perhaps engage in rhetoric and hyperbole to generate some old-fashioned FUD [Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt]? Just looking at the numbers, it's easy to see that even if the scare campaign merely delays a customer's migration from Windows to Linux by a single day, Microsoft is $34 million dollars better off", Zemlin wrote. Meanwhile Novell finally filed the details of its controversial agreement with Microsoft, which supports Novell CEO Ron Hovsepian's claims that his company never agreed to Microsoft's view that Linux violated Microsoft's patents. Novell was expected to file the details with the SEC last July. However the company delayed the filing in order to conduct internal examinations of the options available. The agreement also does not provide any proof that Linux is infringing any of the 45 patents of Microsoft as claimed by the company. In fact Novell specifically inserted a disclaimer in which it states that it does not agree that Linux is guilty of infringing Microsoft's patents. "Nothing in this agreement shall imply, or be construed as an admission or acknowledgement by a party, that any patents of the other party are infringed, valid or enforceable", the disclaimer read. As for Microsoft's threats that it will be suing users of Linux unless they pay some royalties, Richard Fontana, counsel for the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC), believes that the company can find itself very restricted to do so. "Microsoft lawyers who helped craft the MS-Novell deal appear to have overlooked the fact that, by procuring the distribution of lots of free software under GPL Version 2, among other licenses, Microsoft has already lost some of its power to assert patents against subsequent distributors and users of that software", Fontana said.

Launching initially with songs from music company EMI Group PLC, iTunes Plus features tracks that are free of digital rights management, or DRM, technology _ copy-protection software that limits where songs or movies can be played and distributed. The unrestricted content means some songs purchased from iTunes will work for the first time directly on portable players other than Apple's iPod, including Microsoft Corp.'s Zune. The inaugural batch of iTunes Plus songs includes music from Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, Norah Jones, Frank Sinatra, Pink Floyd and more than a dozen of Paul McCartney's classic albums. The DRM-free tracks feature a higher sound quality and cost $1.29 apiece _ 30 cents more than the usual 99-cent price of other, copy-protected songs at the market-leading online music store. If available, users can upgrade existing purchases to DRM-free versions for 30 cents a song or $3 for most albums, Apple said. London-based EMI, the world's third-largest music company by sales, and Cupertino-based Apple announced their partnership in April to deliver the industry's first major offering of DRM-free songs, sharing a vision of what both companies say their consumers want: flexibility and CD-audio quality. Other smaller online music vendors, such as eMusic.com, already offer songs without DRM, but the selections have been limited to mostly content from independent labels. Barney Wragg, the global head of digital music at EMI, said the iTunes Plus launch capped six months of work to convert most all of the company's digital catalog into a DRM-free format. "Our customers told us two things deterred them from buying digital," Wragg said. "They weren't 100 percent confident that the songs they'd purchase could play on their devices, and they wanted something closer to CD quality." Earlier this year, Apple CEO Steve Jobs called on the world's four major record companies to start selling songs online without copy-protection software. "We definitely think it's the right thing to do," Eddy Cue, Apple's vice president of iTunes, said Wednesday. "In this case, EMI's a leader and we think others will follow." In a statement Wednesday, Jobs reiterated that Apple expects that more than half of the 5 million songs on iTunes will feature a DRM-free version by the end of the year. In the meantime, Apple's iTunes Store will continue to offer songs in the same copy-protected format as today at 99 cents per download and encoded at 128 kilobits per second. The iTunes Plus versions are encoded at 256 kbps, which Apple says makes the audio quality on par with original recordings. Apple also will continue to encode its songs _ including EMI's DRM-free content _ in the AAC audio format, which could force some users to go through an extra step of converting tunes into a version that would be compatible with their players. Some gadgets don't support AAC, including SanDisk's newest Sansa Connect or Samsung Electronics Co.'s YP-K3, but industry analyst Susan Kevorkian of the IDC market research company expects support for AAC will widen following Apple's move this week. Amazon.com Inc., by comparison, said it plans to sell songs online later this year in the DRM-free MP3 format _ the popular unrestricted audio standard that is supported by virtually every device, including Apple's best-selling iPod. The next generation of digital music will be untethered from usage restrictions, Kevorkian predicts. It's something major music labels _ other than just EMI _ will have to do if they want to combat the industry's years long decline of music CD sales, she said. "They absolutely have to reach the Internet to drive music sales, and part of that is to remove the hurdle that comes with the lack of interoperability," Kevorkian said. Other major music labels _ Sony BMG Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Music _ have all experimented with limited amounts of unprotected content online but have yet to make as aggressive a move as EMI. Representatives of Warner and Sony BMG declined to comment Wednesday about the iTunes Plus offering or their own plans around DRM technology. Universal did not return a call for comment. Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at JupiterResearch, said any worries the music companies have over increased piracy from DRM-free downloads are overblown. "CDs are all sold without copy protection already, so these (unrestricted) digital files are not going to change the piracy story," he said. "People who aren't going to pay for things aren't going to pay for things, and DRM just adds an unnecessary layer of complexity here for people who do embrace this medium and have already bought billions of songs on iTunes." Shares of Apple closed at $118.77, up $4.42, or nearly 4 percent, and gained another 65 cents in extended trading. In a separate announcement after the stock market closed, Apple said it will soon introduce direct access to YouTube videos from its Apple TV set-top-box device. It also announced a beefier, 160-gigabyte Apple TV model that will be available starting Thursday for $399. ChoicePoint Settles With 44 States RGM Reports 5.2 Pct Stake in Cascade N.A.

The company is thriving in markets around the world. The Wii was the top-selling console system in Canada, the Nintendo DS handheld was the top-selling portable gaming system, and Nintendo held the top four spots for games (Pokemon Diamond Version DS, Pokemon Pearl Version DS, Wii Play, and Super Paper Mario for Wii) for the period of April 8 to May 5, according to the latest Canadian figures released by independent market researchers NPD Group Inc. Nintendo boasted the same achievements in the United States while in France the 15 top-selling games are all for Nintendo systems. Japanese video game maker Nintendo Co's senior managing director and "Mario" creator Shigeru Miyamoto demonstrates the company's new Wii game console controller next to president Satoru Iwata during a news conference in Tokyo. Email to a friend "We're ecstatic over the explosive appeal of Wii and Nintendo DS," said vice president and general manager of Nintendo of Canada Ron Bertram. At the November 2006 launch of the Wii in Toronto, Bertram anticipated good things for the console and hoped for "a strong second place" showing. The actual success is beyond anyone's expectations. In less than five months since introduction, the company has sold six million Wii systems globally and nearly 29 million Wii games. The console has taken a step toward becoming a cultural phenomenon. "Wii is selling out everything we put into the marketplace," said Reggie Fils-Aime, president and CEO of Nintendo of America, speaking at a conference in Seattle on May 22 to announce sales achievements and upcoming games for the company. Sony's PS3, which launched about the same time as the Wii, has sold just 1.84 million units worldwide, while Microsoft has sold more than 10 million Xbox 360 consoles worldwide. The 360, launched in November 2005, had a year head-start over the others. Nintendo now expects to have sold 14 million Wiis by the end of its first fiscal year, March 2008, and has ramped up production to meet the demand. In comparison, about 22 million GameCubes have been sold since its launch in November 2001. Sony's PS2, which launched in October 2000, has sold more than 106 million units around the world but there is now debate over whether Sony can maintain its dominance over the industry. The reason for Nintendo's rise is its approach to new consumers and giving them something different, said Fils-Aime. With its innovative motion-sensing controller, Wii gamers get as close to the action as possible. Players swing the controller like a baseball bat or golf club, leap around their living rooms to make a backhand return in tennis, jab madly away at the air in a boxing bout, and point it at the screen to aim their weapons. Sitting on the couch and pressing buttons just doesn't cut it anymore. The Wii remote controller is also simple to use. It's based more on gestures than button combinations, so there are very few gadgets on it, making it less intimidating to people who've never played games before. Nintendo has also taken aim at non-gamers with titles that veer away from the shooters and racers that appeal to males aged 18 to 35. John Mayer acts out a bizarre ...

Earlier in 2007 Panoramio announced that the number of georeferenced photos in its database had hit the one million mark.

While it is free for users to keep their photos on the Panoramio website, photographers receive no payment for the use of their photos on applications like Earth.

Panoramio links a photo with the exact geographical location from which it was taken, a feature that's a welcome add-on to geo-mapping technologies like Maps.

RSS Feed CBS News RSS Feeds Delta And Dawn Home Free? correspondent based in Los Angeles. It's been 18 days since the mother humpback and her calf were discovered heading up the Sacramento River the wrong way. Under the terms of the Endangered Species Act, state officials are given the power and the finances to pay for rescue efforts when an animal on the list is in trouble. The mother and calf were. They were stuck in the Port of Sacramento 90 miles upstream in fresh water! They had wounds and the mother, they believed, might still be nursing her calf. Without salt water the mother couldn't feed. It could turn into a serious situation. They believed these two had wandered off their migration course from Mexico. Usually Humpbacks give birth in the warm waters between Hawaii and Mexico during the winter and then head up to Alaska for feeding time over the summer with their young in tow. So rescue workers from California Fish and Game along with several agencies decided to try and lure the whales back down stream and into the open ocean to get them back on their migration course. First they started with those weird underwater whale noises. These were whale feeding noises. After a few days of that not working, they figured out that they were maybe playing sounds of the wrong kind of whales feeding and that's why the mother and calf didn't recognize the sounds and follow them. OK; attempt number two would be herding. This was basically to band together a flotilla of boats and push them forward, not physically but just by giving them nowhere to go but in the direction the flotilla was going. This sort of worked but then the whales dove back under the flotilla when they got too close to the next bridge they needed to go under. Basically at each bridge along the river they seemed to hesitate, which makes you wonder how they passed them going up. But that's another story, I guess. So, when the flotilla didn't work, the rescuers decided to employ a flotilla with noise. If the whales were bothered by the traffic noise at bridges (which they sort of guessed they were) then maybe making noise under water would move them back down river. All of this served to move them a little then the whales would stop where they wanted and swim in circles when they wanted. Scientists more than once said "the whales will do what the whales want to do." Really? Then on Sunday, they took off and swam down river and toward the San Francisco Bay. By Monday things were looking good and by Tuesday they were in the bay speeding toward the Golden Gate Bridge and their freedom. By this time, the giant gash on the back of the mother looked like it was getting better. The scientists had been able to give both animals a shot of antibiotics. They tried to put a tracking device on the mother to follow them out to the open sea. By nightfall Tuesday, the two had slowed and were circling off Tiburon, a coastal town just three miles away from the Golden Gate Bridge. This morning we took a fishing boat out into the San Francisco Bay, and like the rescue boats, we couldn't see anything -- just fog and a calm bay. The two humpbacks now known as Delta and Dawn (named by Californias Lt. Governor for the California Delta and the "dawn" of a new day) had vanished -- it appeared this time, for good. Rescuers said if they didn't surface by the afternoon, they were pretty sure they had slipped out during the night. The tracking device had failed and no one may ever really know why or when the two made their way back to open sea waters. But most everyone is glad that they did!! All along the route back toward the ocean, Delta and Dawn had a fan club following them. Not since Humphrey, a lost male humpback did this 22 years ago, did anyone see such a sight. It took a month to lure Humphrey back to the ocean. Delta made it in just 18 days and she was a lot farther inland. Having been married 12 years, this does not surprise me. I can imagine the underwater scene now: Delta: "Anyone down here know how to get to the Golden Gate Bridge????" Humphrey: "I know exactly where I'm going. I looked at the map before I left home." 6:37 PM : May 30, 2007 Read more posts in Now you're in the public comment zone.

With apologies to Shakespeare ("As You Like It"), the newest developments in the online world make conventional mapping Web sites look oh-so-2006. Net a 'Force for Democracy' says Google's Schmidt Google Chairman Dismisses Privacy Issue Today, Google is out with Street View, a new feature built into its Google Maps section. Type in a location you're trying to find, and you'll get a map of the area, just as you have for several years. Now, click on the "Street View" button in the upper right, and a new window opens. You'll find yourself looking at a street-level, 360-degree wraparound image of the place you chose. Move your cursor around in the picture, and you'll find that you can turn, or move down the street, or zoom in on details. Major and Minor Landmarks So, for instance, type in 630 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. (even with typos), and you'll find yourself at the entrance to St. Patrick's Cathedral. Try Las Vegas Boulevard South., move around the picture a little bit, and you'll turn up just off the Strip, watching valets parking cars at the entrance to the Bellagio. "We're just trying to enhance the user experience," says Stephen Chau, a product manager for Google Maps. For now, Street View works only in five cities (New York, San Francisco, Miami, Denver and Las Vegas), but it will expand as quickly as â well, as quickly as Google can take pictures of the entire world. 'If Only I Could Remember Its Name ...' "We can see all sorts of uses," says Chau. "I just moved to a new apartment, and I used Street View to check out the neighborhood. "You can preview the location to see if the real estate listing is accurate â is it close to public transportation, and so forth. There's a sightseeing aspect to it that way." It could also be helpful, he says, if you're trying to find that great little Italian restaurant downtown whose name you forgot. If you don't know the name, you can't exactly look it up, but if you can retrace your steps, virtually, you may find it and be able to zoom in on its sign.

Entitled the Microsoft Surface, the new computer looks more like a living room coffee table, providing enough space for several family members to use the screen at the same time. Surface also aims to make the mouse and keyboard redundant as users will manipulate it using its touch screen to access files, type documents and other general PC activities. "(Microsoft's) entertainment and devices has a long history of bringing innovative product experiences to market - such as Xbox, IPTV and Zune," said E&D executive Tom Gibbons. "The new hardware and software in Surface, along with a predominant focus on the consumer experience, support the Connected Entertainment vision - making entertainment more personal, more interactive and more social." Although Microsoft has yet to explain how the new computer will utilise gaming, they did confirm it will play a key role in the company's 'Connected Entertainment' strategy. Microsoft Surface will initially be seen in hotels and other public venues at a cost of up to $10,000, but the firm has announced it plans to produce cheaper versions to sell to home users within three to five years.

Toshiba revealed that it would be shipping out AMD processors in at least 20 percent of its notebooks sold in United States and Europe. Company spokeswoman Yuko Sugahara said that Toshiba would be including AMD processors in moderate-priced standard models for both individual and corporate clients. Analysts believe that the move comes on the backdrop of intense pressure on Toshiba to compete against its rivals, Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp, both of which make use of chips produced by Intel and AMD. While the last fiscal year saw Toshiba's PC revenues increase by 14 percent, the operating margins remain below the 1 percent mark in that particular area. Sugahara said that the company decided to include AMD processors in its computers following rising "consumer demand" and "favorable terms from suppliers". Analysts see this move as a start of the end of Intel's domination in the chip market. "This could be a message that an era in which Intel took the lion's share of microprocessor profits as the king of PC chips is over. With PCs becoming commodity products, there seems to be a new way of thinking that competition should be introduced even in procurement of such core parts like processors as long as there are no major differences in product specifications", said Yoshihiro Shimada, an analyst at Macquarie Securities. Toshiba is hoping to incorporate AMD chips in some machines so as to reduce its parts cost by at least 10 percent.

http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/72244-The-Price-Is-Not-Right&cid The Escapist : News : The Price Is Not Right The Price Is Not Right Adam LaMosca posted on 29 May 2007, 05:00 PM All this talk about which console manufacturer is providing the consumer the greatest value is missing the point. The market has already decided how much a gaming system is worth. The answer? Probably not much more than $250. Let's look at current generation console prices to date, in U.S. dollars. Nintendo's Wii rings up at about $250. Microsoft's Xbox 360's three flavors include the $300 Core pack, the $400 Premium edition, and the $480 Elite. Sony's PlayStation 3 is available in $500 and $600 options. All other things being equal, the Wii's price is obviously the most attractive, which might explain why it's outselling the 360 by about 2-to-1, and the PS3 by about 4-to-1. But all other things are not equal, of course. Not even close. Any gamer with even passing familiarity with all three systems could expound on their individual hardware strengths and weaknesses. And serious enthusiasts debate at length about the relative values of each console, and to what degree the inclusion of such features as out-of-the-box wireless should be taken into account. The prices of optional and less-optional accessories also figure into the discussion, as do the online services offered. And then there are the games. The quality and marketability of a system's game library, especially its exclusive titles, is a decisive factor in any console's success. Here again, there's plenty of room for speculation about what the future holds for each system. And not surprisingly, gamers are highly attuned to each console's ability to deliver the types of games they crave. For the dedicated gamer, there's a lot to argue, wonder and worry about. For everyone else, though, the issue boils down to one primary concern: price. It would be foolish to overlook brand strengths, marketing strategies and the like in any analysis of why the Wii is selling more units than both of its higher-end colleagues combined. I'm not suggesting that a novel control scheme and Nintendo's family-friendly image aren't helping move Wiis. And the PS3's current lack of high-profile releases is obviously hurting Sony. But these and similar factors are secondary concerns for the wider market. The bottom line is the average consumer is only going to pay so much for a gaming console, regardless of what it offers. Microsoft's and Sony's entries are simply above the price point at which the lion's share of consumers decide a gaming experience is worthwhile. Most people, regardless of their age, tax bracket or nationality, enjoy playing games from time to time, electronic or otherwise. Yet for most of the world, for which games are passing diversions, the prospect of paying hundreds of dollars for an electronic game system seems downright silly. Most gamers who venture forth into the non-gaming world are painfully aware of the fact that average consumers don't view videogames in form as worthy of copious amounts of time, money and attention. It isn't critical to them that the PS3 includes a Blu-Ray player, or the 360's Live service provides a cross-title online community, or that either features high-definition output. They're not overly concerned about the particular handful of exclusives for each console. And they're not nearly as discerning in terms of game design or quality. I'm convinced that both gamers and much of the gaming industry often vastly overestimate the considerations of the average consumer. Round up the electronic gaming experiences that have found wide audiences outside the core gamer demographic, and you'll notice a conspicuous absence of epic, immersive and original high-budget games. Instead, you'll find a steady stream of successful casual entries from PopCap and company. You'll see Nintendo's Touch! Generations titles and an accompanying army of charming, lightweight imitators. And you'll discover a deluge of half-baked cursory tie-ins to movie, television and other pop-culture IPs. The vision espoused by Sony and Microsoft, of an elite gaming lifestyle enabled by high-end, expensive tech, just doesn't appeal to the rest of the world. So it's not a matter of how much their consoles are worth. It's a matter of the degree to which modern society values electronic entertainment. If Nintendo's successes with the Wii thus far are any indication, $250 is near the upper end of what consumers are willing to pay for such experiences. So where does that leave those of us clamoring for the next , or the next-gen successors to Final Fantasy XII, Psychonauts Shadow of the Colossus ? Where does that leave the dyed-in-the wool enthusiast, accustomed to high-definition spectacle? In my less optimistic moments I'm tempted to entertain the suspicions of the populace at large, and wonder whether the near-obsessive attention we often give to games is warranted. Maybe an epic, 100-hour RPG isn't really a valuable use of my time. Does it really matter whether or not my game characters' faces show every pore or whether they perfectly lip-sych their lines? Is my hand-wringing over weapon balancing in the latest multiplayer shooter justified? And can I truly not live without destructible landscapes and motion blur? But in the end I must confess these things often matter to me. There's no denying my own unbridled enthusiasm for the high-end aspects of this medium. I take comfort in the fact I'm not alone, and that even though the high cost of the PS3 seems thus far to be a major Sony misstep, it's still selling units. And with luck it will continue to sell. Because as wrongheaded as Sony and Microsoft often appear to be in their pricing and marketing strategies, I want that slice of their vision, the one that caters to gamers such as myself, to take hold of the world at large. I want a world populated by gamers that recognize not just the value of casual, accessible diversions, but the value of visually rich, artfully designed and emotionally compelling experiences. Earlier this year Xbox platform manager John Rodman made one of those fabulously arrogant remarks we've become so accustomed to hearing from Sony and Microsoft execs. "We don't feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing," he told the . "We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else." As snide as Rodman's remark sounds, there's a grain of truth in what he says. And maybe even a ray of hope. It's not hard to imagine that the widespread successes of the Wii and DS will foster a greater appreciation of electronic games in general. And one has to imagine that at some point loyal DS and Wii converts might yearn for more in terms of graphical fidelity, gameplay depth, or online interaction. Right now, there's no disputing that Nintendo's winning the battle for consumers' hearts, minds and, most importantly, dollars. Will the trend continue, and will it result in an increasingly risk-averse industry, disinclined toward the production of the higher-end titles dedicated gamers seek? Will the lowest common denominator casual and licensed game offerings eventually become the face of the gaming industry? Or will consumers eventually hear the siren song of the higher-priced, higher-end consoles, amplified by growing game libraries and possible console price reductions? Time will tell, but I'm willing to bet that in the years to come, Nintendo will he heralded as having been gaming's chief evangelist, and the successes of casual and B-list games as whole will have established the foundation for an entirely new demographic of gamers. One that might even be willing to pay a lot more than $250 for a gaming console.

Banks PETERSBURG, Ky. -- Ken Ham stood outside his $27 million Creation Museum before its official opening on Monday (May 28) and declared its mission is not just to counter evolution. He also wants to create a few Christians. "We don't just want to see people converted to creationism,'' said Ham, president of the Answers in Genesis ministry, which built the museum on a site officials say is a convenient travel distance for two-thirds of all Americans. "We do want to see people consider the claims of the Gospel, the claims of Christianity, to see people put their faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ.'' The latest juncture between evolutionists and creationists comes in the form of a 60,000-square-foot building whose main hall features animatronic dinosaurs and figures of young children playing near each other in a way its owners believe life really occurred some 6,000 years ago. With the slogan "Prepare to Believe,'' Ham's creation-defending ministry opened the museum on Memorial Day on 49 acres just over the Kentucky state line from Cincinnati. The museum was partially funded by three anonymous families who donated $1 million each, but 75 percent of all donations averaged around $100, officials said. Those donations built a state-of-the-art museum with vibrating seats and sprays of water in a theater that depicts Noah's flood, and extensive exhibits that claim the Grand Canyon could have formed around the time of that flood rather than millions of years ago as suggested by most scientists. A studious visitor could spend several hours in the museum, which includes a planetarium, exhibits detailing the construction of Noah's Ark and life-size sculptures of Eve handing Adam the forbidden fruit from the Garden of Eden. Two days before the official opening, a supportive crowd of hundreds of civic and business leaders and charter members -- some who paid $1,000 for a lifetime membership -- dined on shrimp and fruit kabobs after a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Critics, however, were not far away: a plane circled overhead from the group Campaign to Defend the Constitution (DEFCON) flying a banner that read, "DEFCON SAYS THOU SHALT NOT LIE.'' Atheist and scientific groups have signed petitions complaining the museum fosters "superstition'' and will confuse schoolchildren who see one view there and hear another in high school and college. "The `museum,' as it's called, is part of a campaign to deceive children and undermine scientific understanding in our country,'' said Clark Stevens, co-director of DEFCON. Russell Moore, dean of the School of Theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, disagrees. He traveled from Louisville, Ky., with his wife and four young children to the ribbon-cutting ceremony. "I want to raise children who are able to understand Darwinism and to be able to see the alternative to it,'' said Moore, a proponent of creationism. "We have a biblical text that reveals the universe as it is and I believe in raising children who understand the authority of the word of God and who also understand all of the alternatives ... and are able to make informed, educated analysis of those things.'' One room in the museum features two paleontologists -- both as sculptures and as actors in a brief video -- examining dinosaur bones. One declares them to be thousands of years old; the other says they are millions of years old. The first paleontologist appears again in the last theater presentation, Bible in hand, declaring that every word of the holy book is true. Just outside that last theater, members of a "CARE team'' are ready to answer questions about the video, which begins with the paleontologist holding the bone of an ancient animal and ends with the story of Jesus' resurrection. The team's acronym stands for Compassion, Acceptance, Respect and Encouragement, said Cecil Eggert, the museum's "creation evangelism'' director. He said the 30-member CARE team, which was trained over several weekends, will offer everything from informative pamphlets to praying with someone who has decided to become a Christian. "We know that the bottom line in all of this is to show them that the Bible is truly the word of God, but also (that) the creator God wants to have a relationship with them through his son Jesus Christ and we are here to help them in that journey,'' said Eggert, who has worked at independent Baptist churches in youth and evangelism ministries. The biblical message will extend to the gardens of the museum, which feature sculptures of Tyrannosaurus rex and herons along with waterfalls and bridges over a manmade lake. Signs will link nature to the Bible. "People who come just to the gardens are going to get the Gospel,'' said Tim Schmitt, the museum's horticulturalist. John Haught, a research professor at Georgetown University who is an expert on science and religion, said it's "not terribly surprising'' that a museum would be created to shore up creationists' arguments about the origins of life. "It's important for them to deny evolution because ... if evolution happened, then there was no original perfection,'' said Haught, a Roman Catholic who believes in evolution. "It's absolutely essential for them that there be some fall. Otherwise the whole significance of Christianity gets lost.'' For his part, Haught doesn't see much merit in the museum and expects it will cause an "impoverishment'' of both theology and religion. "It's hard for me to come up with a single reason why we should be doing this,'' said Haught. "It's theologically problematic to me, as well as scientifically problematic.'' Ham, who once was a science teacher in his native Australia, said the museum's exhibits on creation explain the basis of the Christian faith by linking the first sin by Adam to the sacrifice of the "last Adam,'' Jesus. "If you want to go and tell someone about Jesus Christ and about sin and about the need for repentance ... you really can't do it without the foundational history of Genesis,'' he said. "Without the history of Genesis, you have no basis for any Christian doctrine.'' Photo Gallery: View the Creation Museum's Exhibits Op-Ed: The Museum Will Mislead Kids FAQ: What Is Creationism?

Robert Alan Soloway is accused of using networks of compromised "zombie" computers to send out millions upon millions of spam e-mails. U.S. attorney Jeff Sullivan said the case is the first in the country in which federal prosecutors have used identity theft statutes to prosecute a spammer for taking over someone else's internet domain name. Soloway could face decades in prison, though prosecutors said they have not calculated what guideline sentencing range he might face. "He's one of the top 10 spammers in the world," said Tim Cranton, a Microsoft Corp. lawyer who is senior director of the company's Worldwide Internet Safety Programs group. "He's a huge problem for our customers. This is a very good day." ZombiesÂ are computers that have been hijacked to perform commands and functions issued to them by the attackers, often without the owners' knowledge. A U.S. federal grand jury last week returned a 35-count indictment against Soloway charging him with mail fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering. Soloway pleaded not guilty Wednesday afternoon to all charges after a judge determined thatÂ â even with four bank accounts seized by the governmentÂ â he was sufficiently well off to pay for his own lawyer. He has been living in a ritzy apartment and drives an expensive Mercedes convertible, said prosecutor Kathryn Warma. Prosecutors are seeking to have him forfeit $773,000 US they say he made from his business, Newport Internet Marketing Corp. A public defender who represented him for Wednesday's hearing declined to comment. Man accused of running network of zombies Prosecutors say Soloway used computers infected with malicious code to send out millions of junk e-mails since 2003. The computers are called "zombies" because owners typically have no idea their machines have been infected. Zombie computers are typically organized into networks called botnets, and used to distribute spam or phishing e-mails,Â as well asÂ viruses and Trojans that are used to hijack other computers. Botnet operators often rent time or bandwidth on their networks to spam e-mail marketers and phishing scam artists. He continued his activities even after Microsoft won a $7-million US civil judgment against him in 2005, and the operator of a small internet service provider in Oklahoma won a $10-million judgment, prosecutors said. The investigation began when the authoritiesÂ started receiving hundreds of complaints about Soloway, who had been featured on a list of known spammers kept by The Spamhaus Project, an international anti-spam organization. The Santa Barbara County, Calif., Department of Social Services said it was spending $1,000 a week to fight the spam it was receiving, and other businesses and individuals complained of having their reputations damaged when it appeared spam was originating from their computers. "This is not just a nuisance. This is way beyond a nuisance," Warma said. Soloway used the networks of compromised computers to send out unsolicited bulk e-mails urging people to use his internet marketing company to advertise their products, authorities said. People who clicked on a link in the e-mail were directed to his website. There, Soloway advertised his ability to send out as many as 20 million e-mail advertisements over 15 days for $495, the indictment said. Soloway remains in federal detention pending a hearing Monday. &copy; The Canadian Press, 2007 News: More spam, but less worry for computer users Feature: Online crime - Taking on zombie botnets Feature: Malware evolution - Money now the driving force behind internet threats, experts say Feature: Stock spam, the new boiler room Spammers up to new and old tricks: report Feature: Botnets - The end of the web as we know it?

Gates Shows Off 'Surface' Table Computer Computer In Table Lets Users Grab Objects Microsoft Surface Computer Doesn't Need Keyboard POSTED: 12:38 pm EDT May 30, 2007 Microsoft unveiled early Wednesday morning a new kind of computer called Surface. The coffee-table shaped computer responds to touch and bar codes attached to everyday objects. The machines got its public debut at a technology conference in Carlsbad, Calif. Surface is set to arrive in November in T-Mobile USA stores and properties owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide and Harrah's Entertainment. Surface is essentially a Windows-based PC tucked inside a table base, topped with a 30-inch touchscreen in a clear frame. Five cameras that can sense nearby objects are mounted beneath the screen. Unlike most touchscreens, Surface can respond to more than one touch at a time. Videos of the concept last year showed that people could easily drag and drop objects on the screen with their fingers, even grabbing more than one. It also allows for gestures such as squeezing fingers together to zoom in. The concept also included pressure sensitivity that could change what happens based on how hard someone presses. In the earlier demonstration, a keyboard could be projected on the screen -- and enlarged or shrunk -- to input text. Distributed by Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc.

Rescue efforts came to a close Wednesday evening after authorities in boats and helicopters spent all day searching the San Francisco Bay and beyond the Golden Gate Bridge but turned up no sign of the pair. 7:30 p.m. No new sightings by day's end Despite scouring the waters around Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco Bay, no one has seen the injured whales all day, and rescuers hope they have quietly slipped back to their ocean home. Earlier, whales were spotted near Baker Beach, but the experts now believe they were not Delta and Dawn. "We're confident that these animals have swam out to their habitat under the cover of darkness," said Scott Hill of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during a Wednesday evening news conference. Because of the high volume of people seeking information, authorities will keep the Farallones information center open for a few more days. 2:40 p.m. Suggestion number disconnected A telephone number set up so that the public could suggest ways of rescuing the Delta's two injured humpback whales was disconnected Tuesday night after a hacker changed the outgoing message to say that the creatures had been euthanized, a spokesman for U.S. Coast Guard said today. The bogus recording reportedly indicated that the massive operation ended because of a lawsuit and that the whales had been put down to end their suffering. In fact, mother and calf were last spotted Tuesday evening just east of the Golden Gate Bridge, and officials are hoping that the absence of sightings so far today means that they made it safely back home. 9:40 a.m. Air search soon under way Marine experts plan to continue searching the San Francisco Bay and beyond the Golden Gate Bridge all day, but if that turns up nothing, they will assume the whales have safely made it back to the Pacific. There has been no confirmed sighting of the whales since 8:40 p.m. Tuesday when officials saw the humpbacks at Paradise Cay near Tiburon. At a news briefing this morning, officials said a helicopter and several boats will continue to search the area. Vessels have also been posted outside the Golden Gate to look for the large mammals. "We would love to have seen them one last time to say good-bye, but if they made it home, that's what counts," said Bernadette Fees of the state Department of Fish and Game. "We'd be delighted, actually very delighted." Fees said that they will continue rescue work today, operating out of new headquarters in the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary at San Francisco's Presidio. If nothing happens today, she said they will suspend the rescue tonight, but still keep the Farallones information center open for a day or two. When asked about the whales' movements, Fees said they seem to slow down in the afternoons, but officials don't know what they do at night because they haven't been monitoring them after dark. "If we learned anything about these two, they are gonna do what they want to do when they want to do it," Fees said. She also thanked the 70 rescue workers who have been part of the operation. "They've worked together as a team and they put their heart and soul into it," she said. And, although most of the whales' major progress has happened without anyone's help, officials said the rescue experience gave them an unprecedented chance to learn more about the species. It's the first time marine mammal experts have had the opportunity to monitor the endangered whales for such a long time, Fees said, noting they've learned a lot about their general health. Scientists were unable to tag the whales with tracking devises Tuesday because the device was malfunctioning. 7:30 a.m.: Boat operations are under way As of 7:30 a.m., the whales had not been spotted since late Tuesday and rescuers were preparing to go back onto the water to continue their search. "We haven't seen 'em yet," said Carol Singleton, a whale rescue operations spokeswoman with the state's Office of Emergency Services in Sacramento. "We're waiting for a report from the CHP's helicopter, which will do a fly-over." Singleton said officials plan to hold their morning briefing at 9:15 a.m. at Vallejo's California Maritime Academy. "If they cross over, get through the Golden Gate, then we'll have a larger press conference there," she said. At 6:30 a.m., Petty Officer Dorian Jackson of the U.S. Coast Guard's Sector San Francisco said the whales are on pace. "If they continue at the pace they're going, they should hit the Golden Gate (Bridge) by noon," Jackson said. "We're going to be getting a boat under way at 8 a.m." with a complement of boats similar to the one that accompanied them yesterday, he said. Staff writer George Kelly contributed to this story.

For those of us raised in natural history Meccas like the American Museum in New York, the Smithsonian in Washington, or the Field in Chicago, the beautifully designed museum induces an eerie vertigo.

There are also a couple of unfamiliar faces, for a natural history museum, in the tan and finely muscled bodies of Adam and Eve.

People have been speculating for weeks now in both online and print media about how the two would interact with one another in their joint-interview, and just what the two powerful computing geniuses would shed light on, if anything. For those spoiling for a blood-bath, you'll be disappointed. Instead what viewers were treated to was a 90-minute long chat about the past 30 years they've worked as rivals, complete with plenty of reminiscing and laughter at their early ideas. The interview was hosted by Wall Street Journal columnist Walt Mossberg and technology reporter Kara Swisher, read on below for all the deets... For two men who have always had complete contradictory ideas on the future of technology, there was an awful lot of agreement between them regarding personal computing. Both men claimed that the PC still has a long life ahead of it, and with the internet and digital media's advances in the industry, personal computing would go from strength to strength. Gates must have had his PA google - sorry, , compliments, as he commented that "what Steve's done is quite phenomenal. He has incredible taste and elegance". Likewise, Jobs had also brushed up on his manners, and furnished Gates with accolades, including claiming that "Bill built the first software company in the industry...Bill focused on software before anyone". Oh, how Gates must have grimaced then. What is apparent, judging by the transcripts provided by both , plus the various videos floating around, is that the two industry-pioneers really do have an awful lot of respect for one another. All that's reported in the media about them being at loggerheads has now been debunked - sure, they'll always remain rivals, working in the same industry, but that doesn't mean they can't actually see eye to eye occasionally. Indeed, when asked by Kara Swisher what the greatest misunderstanding about the relationship is, Jobs jokingly replied "we've kept our marriage secret for over a decade now", later adding "relationships that are destructive don't help anybody...the era of setting apple and Microsoft up in competition is over". The two discussed at great length applications, and how much adoration Jobs has for Gmaps and external companies. We've seen in recent months Apple partnering up with other companies, for instance the iTunes give-away deal with Coca Cola all the rumours about Google apps being placed on the iPhone, so when Jobs says he admires Microsoft's ability to collaborate with other tech companies, you know he's taken a few pages out of Gates's book. "They learned how to partner with people really well, and I think if Apple could have had a little more of that in its DNA, it would have served it extremely well". When asked by Kara about further plans for next-gen communications and collaboration tools, such as Wikis, an awkward pause was met by both Jobs and Gates. Either they really haven't thought about it, or someone's got something up their sleeve. With both parties obviously facing new online rivals every day, such as Google with their free online programs, a question about whether they worry about these start-ups was inevitable. This is where the differences between the two companies are vast - Steve comments that Apple "takes a different approach...we don't know how to do maps, search, some of this new stuff...so we partner with those companies that do. It's really hard for one company to do everything". As much as it pains me, I definitely see Jobs's point, that partnering with online companies already well-established in their niches definitely works better than developing your own software. Look at Google's own attempt at online video, with Google Video, and how they eventually resigned to fate and acquired YouTube, the only direct competitor in the field. So, there may not have been any bloody spilled, and whilst there wasn't any physical affection displayed ( ! was I the one hoping for a hug?!), they get along really well obviously, and it's apparent they both admire each other's work. Gates admitted "it's been fun to work together...people come and go in this industry, it's nice when someone sticks around!" At the end of Engadget's blow-by-blow live account of the interview, Ryan Block commented that Steve Jobs appeared 'calculating, articulate, very guarded, playing his hand very close to the chest". Surprising, as I always thought Steve was fairly affable and was adopting the use of ' ' within Apple - case in point being the announcement about the iPhone months before launch. Where ol' Billy Gates was concerned, Engadget claimed he appeared "very friendly, very open, [and] surprisingly accessible". That's our Bill, sigh. Nevertheless, Steve can obviously be very smooth when he wants to be, as his parting shot was "when Bill and I first entered the industry, we were the youngest guys in the room, and now weâre the oldestâ¦ And thereâs that one line in that Beatles song, 'You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead,' and I think thatâs clearly true here".

Given its current capabilities, features, and, frankly, a handful of limitations, I made a case explaining why I'll be sitting on the sidelines and not buying an Apple TV for the time being. I did however, leave room to be convinced that my initial judgment was wrong (see BusinessWeek.com, 5/17/07, "Tuning Out Apple TV&mdash;for Now" ). Since Apple ( ) had already promised a series of changes to the device through software upgrades, I was willing to reevaluate the device as new features were added. A Hint of Things to Come On May 30, in a conversation with Walt Mossberg at the D: All Things Digital conference in Carlsbad, Calif., Apple CEO showed exactly what he has in mind for the Apple TV, and while it doesn't look like a big deal today, the implications are very interesting. After a software upgrade available in mid-June, Apple TV users will be able to watch video downloads from Google's ( Jobs described Apple TV as a "hobby," saying that Apple's three main businesses are the Mac, the iPod and the iTunes store, and soon, the iPhone. There's not much of a business yet in bridging the gap between Internet video and the TV set&mdash;Jobs ballparked the current addressable market at just hundreds of thousands of users. So for now, Apple TV remains an interesting sideshow to its existing $20 billion to $24 billion business of selling Macs, iPods, iPhones, and everything else Apple purveys. In time, it may grow into something much bigger, just as the iPod did. Hobby is an interesting choice of words, considering how important Internet video is widely expected to become in the next several years. Market research firm eMarketer reckons that ad spending in conjunction with Internet videos could grow to a $3-billion-a-year business. So when Steve Jobs calls something a hobby, I'm reminded of a professional baseball player named Bo Jackson who took up a "hobby" in 1987&mdash;playing pro football for the Oakland Raiders. Only one month into that hobby, Jackson rushed for 221 yards against the Seattle Seahawks, a rushing record for a Monday night game, and scored three touchdowns. A Record-Breaker in the Making? So if online video is to be a hobby for Apple, lets take a look at the scorecard so far. Is it off to a Jacksonian start? Internet video and YouTube are essentially synonymous, and YouTube is the biggest thing to happen to the Web in several years. In fact, in the days before Google paid $1.65 billion to buy YouTube, there was much speculation that Apple would be the one to acquire it. Meanwhile there are scores of YouTube knockoffs trying to make a go of the business. And with cheap digital camcorders and simple digital production software only getting cheaper and easier to use, the amount of video content will only increase and the quality will only improve. Some day, YouTube will carry high-definition video. Some day, HD video will be everywhere on the Web. This tie-up between Apple and Google isn't about what YouTube is today. Do you really want to watch videos of college kids mixing Diet Coke ( ) and Mentos on your TV when you have an entire season of on your TiVo ( )? Probably not. But YouTube and its ilk aren't always going to be about novelty videos passed from friend to friend via e-mail and blog postings. In time&mdash;and that time isn't far off&mdash;the Web is going to be the premier method of video distribution. Sometimes it will be free, and sometimes you'll pay for it.

At the simplest level, Google Gears is an open source developer product that will give hosted, web-based applications a local desktop home. In other words, Gears solves the problem of using a web application offline. Its key components include the ability to capture and serve up locally the resources and code that comprise a web application, such as all the images, the logic, and the look and feel.&#160; The second major piece of Gears is the ability to create a local database that web applications can access. "This is a rich database with full text search and full transactional capabilities," said Linus Upson, director of engineering at Google. The third feature gives developers the ability to use Gears to run JavaScript in a background task via the multithreading capabilities of multicore processors. With this capability, a developer can create a web-based application and a desktop version that synchronize one with the other. Without this multithreading capability, if a web application was synchronizing with the local desktop version, it would freeze the application until the synchronization was complete. Synchronization is a must-have for any application that lives on two platforms, but any delay would be unacceptable to most users. Beyond the straightforward product details, however, there are other bigger issues in play. When Brent Taylor, head of Google development, says that he would like to see "an industry-wide effort to have these capabilities standardized across all browsers," Taylor is also driving Google's stake in the ground as a leader of the software shift to web 2.0 applications, according to David Mitchell Smith, Gartner analyst. "Google keeps pushing the envelope with browser-based applications," said Smith. The question is to what extent those web applications are accepted in the enterprise. Smith said companies should not overestimate its capabilities. "What they have is a developer kit," said Smith, and every developer of every web application will have plenty of work to create a finished product. At the same time, Google is not the only company looking at ways to extend web applications to the desktop. Adobe's Apollo has a similar goal. However, while Apollo lives on the desktop and can access any local file system, Gears can access only the SQL Light database created by the application. However, the Gears API will be available in Apollo, according to Kevin Lynch, senior vice president and chief software architect at Adobe.&#160; According to Smith, Gears, like AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) before it, puts a lot of capabilities into the hands of developers of the Web, and IT needs to track web application development closely to understand where the next generation of the web is going.&#160; Traditional on-premises enterprise ISVs are also tracking web capabilities intensely to see how they can embrace the new software paradigm. For its part, Microsoft will have to demonstrate the continuing value of rich, client-based desktop applications, said Smith. As Smith says, web 2.0 will not grow beyond gadgets and widgets unless it can establish itself as a development platform for serious, enterprise-level applications. That it cannot do unless data can be saved securely behind the firewall, can be synchronized so that only a single version exists, and is accessible offline as well as online. Gears technology appears to be going a long way toward meeting that goal. Google Gears will be made available at . Although it is still too early to submit Gears to a standards body, according to a Google spokeswoman, Michele Turner, vice president of product management, marketing and developer relations at Adobe said Adobe will be a sponsor. back to news index Steve Jobs on Apple, Mac, iPod and iPhone YouTube lands on the Apple TV Apple sets DRM-free trap Video from Steve Jobs and Bill Gates meet-up SoundSoap Pro updated for Intel Macs WWDC: Don't forget your iPod Palm unveils its 'smartphone companion' Apple TV gets 160GB drive News Corp. buys Photobucket, Flektor Apple launches education site through iTunes Apple officially opens iTunes Plus service Fonelink improves mobile and Mac integration Maroon 5 claim iTunes sales record Apple secures QuickTime with update Apple updates iTunes for DRM-free music sales Google Maps gains street views, miniapps Google opens up Gmail to more users 20 June launch for iPhone WiebeTech debuts its tiny drive Apple TV development kit ships Finnish court rules DVD DRM 'ineffective' More Digital Lifestyle news...
