Computerworld Daily News (First Look and Wrap-Up) The Weekly Top 10 Palm&#039;s Foleo $500 un-laptop (and alien ant farm) Thu, 05/31/2007 - 6:56am Get in sync with Thursday's IT Blogwatch: in which Palm launches the $500 "email companion". Not to mention the Zimbabwe ant farm... Palm Inc. today announced a smart-phone companion product today called Foleo. [It] will connect via Bluetooth to a Treo device running either the Palm operating system or Windows Mobile, and it will use a large screen and full-size keyboard to help users edit e-mail and office documents. Palm co-founder Jeff Hawkins ... called [it] the first in a "major new category" of devices that serve as companions to phones ... Foleo is built on an open Linux-based platform and will sell for $599 with an introductory rebate of $100, bringing it down to $499 ... It will stay synchronized with a smart phone throughout the day at the touch of a button. The device runs the Opera 9 Web browser and will be available sometime this summer ... turns on and off instantly and has a battery that lasts up to five hours ... will feature a 10.2-in. screen and weigh just over 2 lb. ... will also provide Wi-Fi connectivity. Bert Latamore unpeels a banana [That's "Guerrilla", you fool -Ed.] I have hoped for a long time that we would see Linux-based PDAs/smart phones enter the market. I still hope for one that has the Palm application and user interfaces built in so that it will run my 30-odd third party PDA applications. I think the big question with this device is will people spend that much extra for it, and will they carry it around with them, or will they connect their Bluetooth-enabled smart phone to their Bluetooth-enabled laptop to receive and manage email when they are out of the office or home? The advantage of the smart phone in handling e-mail is that you can do it anywhere, without needing a desktop or even a chair. This will require that you carry an extra device, which will probably be too big to fit in a pocket (judging from the description) and which apparently only functions as a terminal for the smart phone. Most people who need computing power away from the desk already carry a laptop, so this becomes yet another device to stuff in that computer bag. Then we get into the question of battery drain, which is always the limiting factor in small device design. Bluetooth is low-power compared to Wi-Fi, but it does drain a smart phone's battery pretty quickly if it is on for a long time. Harry McCracken rides the boondoggle I'm at the Wall Street Journal's D conference, and Palm's Jeff Hawkins--one of the few so-called visionaries in the industry who really is a visionary--is unveiling the Foleo, a new device that he's dubbing a "mobile companion." It's a sort of a subnotebook-looking gadget that he's touting as being a complement to a smartphone such as a Treo. He's saying that he first conceived of it five years ago, when he and the other Palm founders were exiled at Handspring, but it was too early to build it--the technology didn't exist, and smartphones hasn't arrived. The keyboard has an unusual approach to input that reminds me a bit of a Lenovo ThinkPad--there's a pointer nub embedded in the keyboard, a scroll wheel below the space bar, and a couple of "mouse buttons." But no touchpad. Documents to Go, which, as on the Treo, lets you view and edit Microsoft Office documents--Word and Excel, and some basic PowerPoint stuff (you can't create slideshows from scratch, but can make quick edits). You can view PDFs ... it's easy to write applications for the device ... [there's] a photo viewer ... you can browse the Web over Wi-Fi or your phone connection. It reminds Kevin C. Tofel of Windows Smart Displays The new Palm Foleo ... looks to be a small 10-inch laptop with keyboard, but looks are deceiving. The Foleo is actually an extension to your Palm Treo smartphone: the two devices are connected via Bluetooth to provide you all of your smartphone data on a larger screen with an attached full-sized keyboard. Since the Foleo isn't a full or heavy OS-laden computer, it provides the advantage of "Instant On" capabilities. I see it a nice way to view and interact with your Palm data or use with your phone's connection to browse the web on a larger screen for up to five hours on a battery charge. Additionally, you can use it to browse pictures, provide presentations and more ... definitely is reminscient of the Microsoft Windows Smart Displays that might have been ahead of their time. My initial thought: very innovative and it will appeal to Palm Treo owners. Will it appeal to the UMPC market? The keyboard is there, but the computing power and the inability to run a multitude of every Windows apps leads me to a limited UMPC audience. But Carlo Longino is underwhelmed Stick A Fork In Palm ... 'cause-they're-done It's hard to understand the point of the Foleo, or why Hawkins and Palm think it's so wonderful. There are two ways to see it: first, as an admission that Palm won't ever be able to create a Treo that will satisfy users' needs, or an admission that they think their Treos are perfect and this is the only way they can figure out to improve on it. Neither is particularly good for the company. The Foleo's hardly compelling, when $500 fully-featured laptops are pretty common these days, while the future lies in crafting more powerful and useful smartphones, not in simply relegating them to serve as a modem for a redundant bigger device. And Rod Edwards is aghast Arrghhhhhhhh. I can&rsquo;t help but be curmudgeonly when this sort of craziness is what&rsquo;s making the news. Looks too big to be pocketable ... Overlaps with laptop usage scenarios ... Another layer of synchronization: Desktop syncs to smartphone. Smartphone syncs to Foleo ... Overlaps with UMPC but with 1/100th the functionality ... EXPENSIVE: $500 for an adjunct screen and keyboard for your smartphone ... Overlap with web email and document editing tools ... A nice big screen that can&rsquo;t play movies. There&rsquo;s a vanishingly small niche of people that would find this compelling and affordable. Lame, lame, lame ... Palm to struggle, cheap acquisition bait for also-lame Motorola. Video will suck on the Foleo. Even low-quality YouTube videos will be "jerky," thanks to the Foleo's sluggish processor. But Your humble blogwatcher is bemused Sounds to me like what Microsoft's Origami/UMPC should have been: light, focussed, inexpensive, instant-on. Most criticism boils down to, "It's not a full-featured Windows laptop." Well, duh! Let's see: Ultra-light / Inexpensive / Full-featured -- In many ways, it tries to solve the same problems as the Nokia 770/N800 line -- but in a more conventional form-factor (i.e., it has a keyboard).

It's ultra-light. Sadly, it's expensive and it's lacking in features. If it had come out under $200, or could play all the media the Treo could (which includes video and games), it would be something to crow about. So sad to see Palm flounder this way... on Thu, 05/31/2007 - 8:31am| Why is RIM destroying Palm in the market place. Let's see. Hmmmmm Foleo, I am sure in some language it means foolish. What marketing genius came up with this one. on Thu, 05/31/2007 - 9:22am| I agree that RIMS is beating out the competition, but if any cell company allowed email to work for free, they would beat out RIMS. There are now 3 phone OSs. Palm, Windows Mobile, and RIM. Due to palms simple design and easy programming it'll still be around, but needs to be updated with more active communcations between devices and the internet. This new Feleo has good intentions (quick response, compact, and lightweight), but I'll just pull out my laptop and use it wherever I go and use a cell card. on Thu, 05/31/2007 - 10:13am| Post a new comment The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

You've probably heard from him, federal authorities say. Many times. And with his arrest, you could see an immediate decrease in the amount of spam e-mail in your inbox, they said. One expert estimated that the man agents dubbed the "Spam King" when they arrested him Wednesday sent billions, perhaps even tens of billions, of e-mails a day. On just two groups of servers, in just a few months, federal investigators found more than 200 million spam messages linked to 27-year-old Robert Soloway. The online empire was run from Soloway's high-end, Harbor Steps apartment on the Seattle waterfront, investigators said. Wednesday, he appeared in court unshaven, wearing loafers with no socks, to hear Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Warma announce that if he's found guilty of the fraud, money laundering and identity theft charges in the 35-count indictment, he could spend decades behind bars. "We know that Robert Soloway is one of the most prolific spammers in the world," Warma said before the hearing. "He has condemned them (his victims) to perpetual spam hell" unless they escape by canceling their domain names or changing their Internet protocol addresses. So notorious is Soloway that the Internet fumes with anti-spammers worldwide livid with his alleged activities. There are endless rants, tricks on how to stop him, a Web site called "solowaysucks.net," and all sorts of personal dirt -- from Soloway's driving infractions to clues on where he went to high school to a link on how to call his mother. "Punk," "worm," "piece of (excrement)" and "bloody gutless coward" are among the nicer epithets. But on Wednesday, many people rejoiced. "Busted!" wrote one anti-spam activist online. "Fantastic news," wrote another. "It's extremely gratifying," said Neil Schwartzman, the executive director for the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email, an anti-spam group. He said that Soloway not only spammed people, but targeted anti-spammers with "mail bombings." "Truly, this is a really bad guy," he said. The feds have taken steps to seize Soloway's bank accounts, but don't know yet how much money they contain. "He claims not to have any money," said U.S. Attorney Jeff Sullivan. "But he drives a very expensive car (500 series Mercedes) and lives in a very expensive apartment." In an apparent effort to hide the true ownership of his Web site, authorities say Soloway constantly moved it to different domains -- even registering last year through Chinese Internet Service providers. The spammed messages used to advertise his corporate Web sites contained false header information and were relayed using networks of slave computers called "botnets." Soloway's alleged actions in the virtual world caused real-world chaos. His spam contained phony headers with e-mail addresses or domain names of innocent real people or organizations, which were subsequently blamed for Soloway's spam and "blacklisted" as a result. "The amount of damage he does to the Internet -- the fraud thing to innocent people who think they're hiring some Internet person -- is awful," said John Reid, a volunteer with The Spamhaus Project, an anti-spam group. He said Soloway preyed on computer-gullible business owners who thought they were hiring a legitimate company to help increase traffic to their Web sites -- only to discover that Soloway sent waves of spam in their name. Soloway, who has also lived in California and Oregon, has been on the group's top 10 list for notorious spammers in recent years, but isn't on it currently. Reid estimated that Soloway sent billions, perhaps even tens of billions, of e-mails a day. "He's very high-volume," he said. In 2005, Microsoft won a $7 million judgment against Soloway, after it sued him over spam sent through Microsoft's MSN and Hotmail services. Later that year, an Internet service provider in Oklahoma won a $10 million judgment against him in a spam-related lawsuit. The government has filed a claim for $772,998 from Soloway, representing the proceeds of his activity. The grand jury indictment accuses Soloway of operating Newport Internet Marketing Corp., which offered a "broadcast e-mail" software product and "broadcast e-mail" services that constitute illegal spam under the federal CAN-SPAM Act. The law, which went into effect Jan. 1, 2004, makes it illegal to transmit a large number of commercial e-mail messages in combination with certain criminalizing factors, such as using another computer to relay the message with the intent to hide its source or using falsified header information in the e-mail. Soloway allegedly used such techniques to defeat spam filters. The Northwest Computer Crimes Taskforce, which is housed at the FBI and includes the IRS Criminal Investigation Division and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, launched an investigation after the Federal Trade Commission and the state Attorney General's Office received hundreds of complaints that Soloway and his corporation had made false and fraudulent claims about his products and services. The victims couldn't get refunds, felt threatened and were being blamed for sending illegal spam as a result of patronizing Soloway's company, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Warma. Chuck Harwood, director of the FTC in Seattle, appealed to victims of spam to complain to his office by forwarding the offending e-mail to spam@uce.gov. Sullivan, the U.S. attorney, said spam affects everyone who goes online. "It's estimated that 80 percent of the traffic on the Internet is, in fact, spam." Soloway will spend at least the next five days at the Federal Detention Center at SeaTac pending a detention hearing Monday. P-I reporter Nina Akhmeteli contributed to this report.

http://www.smh.com.au/news/mobiles--handhelds/palms-new-baby/2007/05/31/1180205383412.html&cid Palm's new ultra-compact companion - Mobiles & Handhelds - Connectivity Welcome to The Sydney Morning Herald. Palm's new ultra-compact companion The Palm Foleo has a large screen and full-size keyboard with which to view and edit email and office documents residing on a smartphone. 9:51AM Palm&#160;has introduced a compact portable computer to accompany its Treo smartphone, seeking to regain its competitive edge in the crowded high-end handheld device market. The new "Foleo" is about the size of a hardcover book and, at 1.1 kilograms, half the weight of other small laptop computers. It is designed to be used with a smartphone, to help business travellers better manage their e-mail and documents by offering a 10-inch screen, full keyboard and wireless technology. Palm, best known for personal digital assistants (PDAs) and Treo phones, said it expects the Foleo to eventually work with rival smartphones such as Research In Motion's Blackberry and Apple's iPhone, although it has not discussed technology-sharing agreements with those companies. Company founder Jeff Hawkins said he expected unit sales of Foleo - priced at $US599 before a $US100 rebate beginning this summer in the US - to be smaller than Treo units sales at first. Will Palm's Foleo fly? "Ultimately, it will make smartphones more successful," he said in an interview. "The volume we anticipate selling of Foleo initially will be small compared to the volume of Treos. It's not going to be a driver in the short term. But it allows us to rethink how you design smartphones." The Foleo may signal a shift in focus for Palm, which dominated the market for personal digital assistants (PDAs) after it launched its original Palm Pilot in 1996. Its PDA sales dwarfed those of rivals such as Hewlett-Packard and Sony, but PDA demand dwindled early in this decade as similar features were built into cheaper mobile phones. Palm's Treo, which combines a phone with its PDA operating system, eventually became the company's signature product with shipments of 2.3 million units in the last fiscal year. Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies in San Jose, said mass appeal for the Foleo is not likely, since smartphones represent a fraction of the overall mobile phone market and only a portion of those customers will be interested in carrying a separate device. Moreover, many business travelers are resigned to carrying a smartphone and a full portable computer. "I will argue that this product is for the 'road warrior.' It's not probably for mainstream, it's more of a business tool," said Bajarin, who noted that Foleo will compete with low-cost laptop PCs. "It will hit a nerve with a certain segment and in that sense has a lot of potential." With Foleo, Palm enters the burgeoning world of open source computing, a growing market of devices that are not based on the dominant operating system software made by the likes of Microsoft or Apple. Open source developers traditionally write software that builds upon others' work, and is distributed for free or at low cost. Palm's device would also compete with Dell, which last week started selling Linux-based PCs. "One big unknown is what happens if the open source world decides to embrace (Foleo), as the first mobile Linux portable. It actually has potential ... if the open source world decides that this is a powerful way of expending the Linux franchise," Bajarin said. Separately, Palm Chief Executive Ed Colligan played down speculation that the company was for sale, saying that the new product proves it is working on innovation. "We're not focused on figuring out how to sell the company," he said on the CNBC television network. Shares of Palm were up 1.7 per cent on Wednesday afternoon, rising 27 cents to $US16.45 on the Nasdaq. send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today Palm's new ultra-compact companion The Palm Foleo has a large screen and full-size keyboard with which to view and edit email and office documents residing on a smartphone.

MEGA DOPPLER 13 ANYWHERE: Get Mega Doppler 13 radar on your cell phone or PDA for free NASA administrator questions need to combat global warming - NASA administrator Michael Griffin is drawing the ire of his agency's preeminent climate scientists after apparently downplaying the need to combat global warming. Info mentioned on air In a pretaped interview to be broadcast this morning on National Public Radio's ":Morning Edition" program, Griffin is asked by NPR's Steve Inskeep whether he is concerned about global warming. "I have no doubt that a trend of global warming exists," Griffin told Inskeep. "I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with." "To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn't change," Griffin said. "I guess I would ask which human beings -- where and when -- are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take." Griffin's comments -- released in transcript form by NPR -- immediately drew stunned reaction from James Hansen, NASA's top climate scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. "It's an incredibly arrogant and ignorant statement," Hansen told ABC News. "It indicates a complete ignorance of understanding the implications of climate change." Hansen believes Griffin's comments fly in the face of well-established scientific knowledge that hundreds of NASA scientists have contributed to. "It's unbelievable," said Hansen. "I thought he had been misquoted. It's so unbelievable." News media inquiries to NASA headquarters about Griffin's comments prompted the space agency to make the unusual move of issuing a news release late Wednesday night. "NASA is the world's preeminent organization in the study of Earth and the conditions that contribute to climate change and global warming," Griffin said in a statement. "The agency is responsible for collecting data that is used by the science community and policy makers as part of an ongoing discussion regarding our planet's evolving systems. It is NASA's responsibility to collect, analyze and release information. It is not NASA's mission to make policy regarding possible climate change mitigation strategies. As I stated in the NPR interview, we are proud of our role and I believe we do it well." Hansen, featured prominently in Al Gore's global warming documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth," has been warning of the potential dangers of climate change since the 1980s. In late 2005, he accused NASA of trying to improperly censor him after he warned that Earth's climate might be approaching a dangerous "tipping point." The agency later fired a public affairs employee, a political appointee of the Bush administration, over the incident. Last year, many NASA scientists were upset when reports surfaced that the agency had quietly deleted the phrase "to understand and protect our home planet" from the NASA mission statement. The scientists believe research on issues like climate change will suffer as NASA shifts priorities toward exploration missions to the moon and Mars. "Earth has always been central to NASA's science," Hansen said. Copyright &copy; 2007 ABC News Internet Ventures If you have a comment about this or another story on abc13.com, discuss it here.

Toshiba&#039;s AMD Laptops Due in Fall A few more details emerge about the three energy-efficient Turion-powered notebooks. Part 1 of a special five-part series. Martyn Williams, IDG News Service Wednesday, May 30, 2007 7:00 AM PDT A little more detail is known about the new laptops from Toshiba Corp. that will use processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Toshiba will launch three laptops in its Satellite range in North America based on AMD's Turion 64 X2 dual-core chip and M690 chipset, AMD said on Wednesday. Toshiba, which confirmed plans on Tuesday for AMD machines but offered no details, said Wednesday that the computers will be available in the third quarter. The M690 chipset has just been launched by AMD and will, according to the company, help reduce power consumption and lead to a 25 percent increase in battery life compared to the previous-generation AMD platform. The Japanese PC maker, which ranked fourth in the laptop market in the first quarter of this year, hasn't used AMD chips in laptops since 2000. In an antitrust lawsuit filed against processor-rival Intel Corp. in 2005 AMD alleged that Toshiba stopped using its chips after receiving a "very substantial" payment from Intel. Toshiba was receiving "market development funds" from Intel worth about US$25 million to $30 million per quarter and those would be jeopardized if it used AMD chips, the lawsuit alleged. AMD is stepping up pressure against Intel in the laptop market and recently disclosed plans to launch a new laptop platform called Puma in 2008. Puma is AMD's answer to Intel's recently launched Santa Rosa laptop platform. The two companies are locked in competition at the bottom-end of the laptop market too. AMD scored the contract to supply chips for One Laptop Per Child's "$100 laptop" after which Intel introduced its own machine for emerging markets, the Classmate PC. / 1000 max characters Sony Adds Two Compact Laptop Lines Palm Introduces Foleo &#039;Mobile Companion&#039; Entry-Level Toshiba Laptop Gets AMD Chip OLPC Seeks Educational Games for XO Laptop Dell Ships Ubuntu Linux PCs Vista on a Laptop, Part 3 VeriSign CEO Stratton Sclavos resigns, investment community pleased.

For your heretofore respected newspaper to feature, as front-page serious news, the opening of a self-styled "Creation Museum" whose purpose is to indoctrinate the gullible and ignorant with foolish, unscientific, and incidentally unoriginal fables is an indelible stain upon your integrity. For any rational person to claim the earth was created in six days some 6,000 years ago is so patently ludicrous, such an impossibility, and so preposterously counter to established proven science as to be worth only scorn and ridicule. Furthermore, the assertion by this "Answers in Genesis" group that Biblical creation is true is ipso facto false. Just read the first two chapters of Genesis to find two separate (1:1-2:3 and 2:4b-25) conflicting and inconsistent, e.g. order of creation, accounts which themselves are derivative with background in older Near Eastern mythology, e.g. the flood and creation myths in "Epic of Gilgamesh" and "Enuma Elish"! Answers in Genesis indeed! Which account? These people are pathetic. But you know better and, therefore, your article is a cheap, irresponsible pandering to superstitious readers; at best this belongs in a small paragraph with the "Star Wars" anniversary story in the escapism section. To impart cover of credibility and respectability to emotion-driven drivel and its attendant squandering of $27 million is intellectually reprehensible journalism and to promote and publicize humbug as reliable, important news just feeds garbage disguised as sustenance to the misguided, the lost, and those so anxious for security they will believe the unbelievable. For shame! Evolution not science, rather a sacred cow A May 28 article reprinted from the [Los Angeles] Times is a lie promoted by an obviously atheistic author. Evolution parades behind a mask of "science," but is really a sacred cow that is as factual as Greek mythology. It contradicts even the most basic laws of thermodynamics. Only a fool who is trying to escape accountability before the Creator would believe such far-fetched jargon. Creationism welcomes and encourages investigation. However, how the universe began is a matter of history, not science. The Bible is a book of history that factually records the historical events of creation. Unless you are willfully blind, the fact that the universe operates by design is a simple deduction from everything you see in the cosmos. It is evolution that is an assault on science. Potential is strong for light rail in city Thank you for the article on light rail in Toledo. As a former Toledoan now living in St. Louis, I can vouch for the benefits of the Metro mass transit system here, including the Metrolink rail lines. Toledo will need to do its homework carefully and assess its options realistically to design an effective network of bus and rail lines, but the potential is certainly there. In St. Louis, stops at educational institutions, hospitals, and other large employers create a steady demand that helps supplement the event traffic from sports events, concerts, etc. I think Toledo could find a successful mix as well, and I wish the region success as it explores its options. I can't wait to buy my first TARTA rail ticket. Transit system could boost area tourism After traveling to many cities in this great nation of ours, I was excited to read that Toledo is seriously considering a light rail system. This type of mass transit not only can be environmentally friendlier than autos, but it can provide a fast method of getting downtown and stimulate economic growth. What seriously disappointed me, though, was that no mention was made of running light rail to and from the local airport. Can you imagine a bigger push for the "Buy Local-Fly Local" campaign than if citizens of Toledo were able to take a light rail to the airport for a fraction of the cost of parking there? Conversely, as the city tries to boost its tourism and convention business, can you imagine if air travelers were able to hop on a light rail and have quick access to the downtown hotels? Better yet, hop on a light rail and be dumped out at the SeaGate Convention Centre, Fifth Third Field, or the new downtown sports arena? This can be done. Twenty years ago I got my first experience traveling via light rail from the suburbs of Cleveland to the downtown district - years before Jacobs Field opened up. In Chicago, Toronto, San Francisco/Oakland, New York and many other cities, a light rail or subway has a stop right next to their baseball fields and arenas. Heck, even Detroit, whose downtown revitalization has only just begun, has a monorail system that takes travelers throughout the downtown area. I only hope that our local leaders can think this far out, and not just to their next election. Reducing oil imports can help war effort During World War II we supported our troops by making sacrifices at home while they were overseas fighting. This required rationing of scarce commodities such as gasoline, tires, automobiles, and certain foods. As we fight the current war, which is going on all over the world, we are reluctant to make any sacrifice at home. Apparently a large number of us do not understand we are at war with an enemy who has sworn to wipe us off this earth. This enemy recruits followers from any area of discontent in any country. He answers to no sovereign nation but receives support from nations who find that this disruptive force can serve their purposes. One way we could help is to reduce imports of oil. Our dependence on these imports is making some foreign countries rich and allowing some of this money to flow to the various groups that are committed to our destruction. In other words, we are financing the groups our troops are fighting and dying to allow us to live free. Some of the ways we could reduce oil imports are to raise the corporate average fleet economy standard each year for automobiles; establish a CAFE average for non-commercial trucks; have an excise tax on vehicles that do not at least meet the CAFE averages and use the proceeds to support alternative sources of energy, and pass legislation that would reduce the importation of oil by 10 percent of the amount imported in the prior year. If we allow that pattern each year for 20 years I believe we would be importing approximately 12 percent of what we are currently importing. Supply and demand is elementary concept Have you ever watched Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader? That is the show that came to mind when I read the letter titled, "Why is diesel cheaper than unleaded?" I thought just about everyone knew about supply and demand. Although the fuel indeed comes from the same barrel, gasoline is a more refined fuel. Diesel is a heavy fuel and in the winter when people are using more (heavy) heating oil, the cost of diesel goes up. In the summer, when people are using less heavy fuel and more gasoline for their cars, mowers, boats, etc., the cost of gasoline goes up. Ergo, supply and demand. I'm pretty sure I learned this in elementary school. Where's the coverage of fallen troops? As a reader of The Blade, I was very sorry to read about Officer Keith Dressel getting killed in the line of duty, but enough is enough. We had to see on TV a solid week about his funeral, and read about it every day, and still we hear about him and his family. It was his job! What about our soldiers getting killed in the line of duty? One hundred and four were killed in the Iraq war in April. You reported it like, ho-hum, another bunch killed. Does anyone think or even care about the families they left behind?

No such luck: instead of kicking off the final battle for dominion over the universe, the billionaires traded limp platitudes about how much the other has contributed to the technology industry. "I'd give a lot to have Steve's taste," said Gates, as he sat next to a man wearing a turtleneck, stonewashed jeans, and grey trainers. In return, Jobs admired Microsoft's history of beating on its partners for cash: "I think if Apple could have had a little more of that in its DNA, it would have served it extremely well." They joined their wizardly powers to pump "post PC devices" - PDAs and their ilk - while predicting the resilience of the personal computing era. Beyond that, the session stayed on the safe territory of the Apple vs Microsoft memory lane, latterly pedestrianised by Redmond's new Googlier nemesis in Mountain View, and Apple's dropping of "Computer" from its name to confirm its rebirth as a consumer electronics maker. The occasional rehearsed quip about Apple's anti-PC ad campaign, or satirical blogger , was about as entertaining as the encounter got. Not that it will bother D5's organisers, the name brand columnists Walter Mossberg and Kara Swisher: the high-priced conference was attended by about 600 tech executives, and probably a similar number of enthralled reporters. Gates' and Jobs' joint appearance was their first since a looming projection of the Microsoft man was booed by Apple fanboys at MacWorld in 1997. In a misty-eyed summation of the dynamic duo's role as high kings of tech, Jobs uncorked a cute soundbite in tribute to their omniscience. Invoking his new best chums The Beatles by quoting , while also referencing Gates' 1995 crystal ball-gazing tome , he said: "You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead." The conference has provided a selection of "rip-roaring laughs" from the head to head in a highlights reel . For those who feel their spleen might burst if they watch the pair's relentless gagsmithing edited together, the entire spectacle is also available as a seven-chapter epic. &reg; Post a new comment Ruddy Hell!

Okay, maybe nobody ever actually speculated about that last one but the point is that PSP firmware updates are ten a penny these days and yet none of them seem to really change much about the console. (Read our How To to upgrade your PSP firmware feature if this is all new to you). The latest, version 3.5, is particularly unexciting. The full list of changes is as follows: Support has been added to allow over the Internet in 'Remote Play'. 'Communication setting' has been added to the Remote Play menu. 'RSS Channel Guide' has been added as a feature under 'RSS Channel'. The remote play option is admittedly very cool ( if somewhat over due ) but it's only of benefit to those who own a PlayStation 3. As for the RSS feed updates, they are hardly going to convince any PSP fence-sitters to part with their cash any time soon.

Stellar Emery not enough for Sens Rodriguez helps talk Yankees into a win Planting trees good for the conscience Jobs and Gates trade jests at rare joint appearance Published:Â Thursday, California (Reuters) - It turns out that Steve Jobs has a soft spot in his heart for PC guys. "PC guy is great, he's got a big heart," the chief of Apple Inc. said on Wednesday, referring to popular television ads in which a hip young man personifies a Macintosh computer and a Windows PC is played by an awkward middle-aged man. Apple Corporation Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs introduces the new operating system, OS 10.5 "Leopard" to the crowd at the Apple 2006 Worldwide Development Conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, California, in this August 7, 2006 file photo. Jobs and Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates appeared in their first joint interview in 14 years on Wednesday .REUTERS/Dino Vournas Email to a friend "The art of those commercials is not to be mean, but it's actually for the guys to like each other," Jobs said. His generous interpretation might have had something to do with the fact that Jobs was sitting next to Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates in their first joint interview in 14 years. Gates rolled with the joke, saying of the PC guy: "His mother loves him!" It was one of several light moments in a highly anticipated meeting of the two computer industry titans at an annual technology conference run by the Wall Street Journal. Anyone hoping for a bruising showdown between the computer industry's richest executive and one many regard as its coolest would have been disappointed. Jobs, 52, and Gates, 51, reminisced about the industry and old partnerships. The tone was jovial, even sentimental, but Jobs did get in a few good-natured digs. At one point, Gates said employees working on Microsoft's Zune portable media player admired Apple for creating the market for such devices with its hugely successful iPod line. "And we love them because they're all customers!" countered Jobs. Jobs, a boyhood electronics ace, and Gates, a programming prodigy, have seen their once-intense rivalry mellow in recent years, but the history of mutual antagonism is the stuff of legend and was even immortalized in a 1999 TV movie, "Pirates of Silicon Valley." Wednesday's event came almost exactly 10 years after a landmark 1997 deal that saw Microsoft take a financial stake in Apple and pledge to keep making software for Macs, an arrangement that helped pull the struggling company back from the brink of failure. One of the more bizarre moments on Wednesday came when the two were asked if their rivalry had been overblown. "We've kept our marriage secret for over a decade now," Jobs said, to roars of laughter. Gates appeared flummoxed. Jobs did offer two tidbits about upcoming Apple products. He hinted that ".mac" -- the company's package of online services like e-mail and Web storage for Mac users -- is about to undergo a big overhaul. After a questioner suggested .mac had failed to live up to lofty expectations, Jobs said: "I couldn't agree with you more. We'll make up for lost time in the near future." Known for his showmanship, Jobs also enthused about the map software Apple created for its iPhone, which is scheduled to hit the market later this month. "The (application) we were able to write ... blows away any Google Maps client." Jobs said, referring to the Web search company that provided some technology for the map software.

Thousands of YouTube videos will be available to Apple TV from mid-June; however, the full catalogue will not be viewable until Autumn. YouTube users will be able to log into their YouTube accounts via Apple TV and save their favourites and subscribe to video streams. Jobs said: This is the first time users can easily browse, find and watch YouTube videos right from their living room couch. This move by Apple may help bring the Apple TV from a niche product to a competitor. Currently users are restricted in that they can only wirelessly stream iTunes content on to their Apple TV. However, the appeal may be limited given the low quality of YouTubes Flash videos and the fact that they cannot be saved onto the Apple TV or your PC. YouTube content will be piped directly to Apple TV from a wireless router, bypassing your computer and iTunes. YouTube is currently being sued for US$1.1bn by Viacom for violation of copyright, due to the vast amount of user-uploaded Viacom material freely distributed on the video sharing site. However, a spokesperson for Viacom, commenting in relation to this new offering by Apple TV, said that the company welcomed an opportunity to license their content to Apple.

Apple's bold gamble could push the rest of the music industry into offering DRM-free music. Staff Writer, CNET News.com Published: May 31, 2007, 4:00 AM PDT Apple has plunged into uncharted waters by stripping security software off some of its music. Never before has Apple sold songs without attaching antipiracy software--the digital rights management systems that prevent file sharing and are hated by many music fans. If successful, Apple's bold gamble to do away with digital rights management, or DRM, could act as a whirlpool that sucks the rest of the music industry into DRM-free music, say analysts. Apple's iTunes music store begins selling MP3s that are unprotected by digital rights management software. If the move succeeds, the major record labels might follow suit and strip copy-protection software from their music offerings. More stories on this topic Apple on Wednesday began selling unprotected MP3s from record label EMI. Shoppers have the option to purchase either a 256kbps AAC-encoded DRM-free song for $1.29 via iTunes Plus, or the usual 128kbps AAC-encoded DRM version for 99 cents. The move is important on many levels. For the first time, consumers can play music from Apple's iTunes on digital players other than the iPod. For Apple, offering DRM-free songs could hand the company some credibility in dealings with European regulators, who want the company to open up iTunes to third-party hardware makers. For the record industry, it once again may find itself being herded into a direction of Apple's choosing. In this situation, the record companies can only benefit, said Greg Scholl, president and CEO of The Orchard, a New York-based music distribution and marketing company. "The only way we're going to discover the right way to grow the market is by experimenting," Scholl said. "I think the price Apple is charging is still too high and will probably inhibit (sales). But right now there isn't enough data to know what the right pricing is or how to market digital music. At least Apple is trying something new." It's important to note that the music being offered without copy protection by Apple and EMI represents only a fraction of the most popular music. The majority of Apple's 5 million songs still feature Apple's FairPlay DRM scheme. EMI is the only one of the four top record labels to release unprotected music. The other four account for 70 percent of the world's music. While Apple said it expects half of its music to be available on the site without DRM, most of it likely would be the millions of songs iTunes offers from independent labels. Curiously, Apple didn't exactly ballyhoo the new service. The company on Wednesday placed an advertisement on iTunes' front door amid a handful of other promotions. Customers must also first upgrade to the latest addition of iTunes in order to obtain EMI's unprotected songs. That DRM-free music wasn't promoted heavily worried Scholl. "I would think that if you're a major label and you don't want something to work, the best plan would be to hide it," Scholl said. Even the staunchest DRM proponent must recognize that copy-protection software is losing some momentum. Two weeks ago, Amazon.com--the fourth largest distributor of music online--announced that a new digital music store due to open soon would also . Industry insiders told CNET News.com that they expected other top e-tailers to soon try out DRM-free music. . Immediately after CEO Steve Jobs issued his February letter calling for an end to DRM , Microsoft said the total abolition of such protections would be irresponsible since they are needed for subscription music and other new business models. But the company reversed itself in April and announced plans to offer DRM-free music from EMI and others. What Apple has succeeded in doing is to raise questions about how the music industry is pursing its digital music strategy, said Susan Kevorkian, an IDC analyst. Chief among the questions is why the record labels place copy protection on digital songs but not on CDs. Gates, Jobs share stage, memories Why Google shows developers the love Will labels hum along with DRM-free iTunes? Extra: Sci-fi writers join war on terror "CD specifications never included native content protection," Kevorkian said. "New CDs purchased today aren't protected either so there's been this inconsistency in the music industry's strategy. When you have an unprotected CD, you can rip songs to MP3s and do with them what you want. We think that by pursuing a more consistent digital strategy the potential is there to reach more consumers." The record industry has said in the past that placing copy protections on CDs is expensive. The format was developed long before the digital age or the "consumer-oriented Internet" emerged, said one record executive who asked for anonymity because she was not authorized to speak for her company. Regardless, Apple's DRM-free offering shows how easily the company can put the record industry on the defensive. What happens if DRM-free music on Apple becomes popular? Kevorkian suggests the music industry start worrying less about fighting piracy and more about profiting from downloads. "They can try new strategies around prices and marketingï¿?particular to older buyers," Kevorkian said. "There are different paths to go down to drive music sales and those paths are better than what we've seen to date."

The search engine behemoth marked out clear intentions to enter territory dominated by Microsoft by offering free, open source technology that works without an internet connection. Gears will run online and offline, allowing users to access data normally only available when plugged into the web. Google already offers its own web-based docs and spreadsheets product to its users and said it plans to introduce programs including email, calendars, and word processing to its millions of users via the off-line browser extension software. Google said it is keen to build "next generation web applications" and hopes to work closely with developers in the open source community to drum up new ways and means of delivering software to its users. The firm said a Javascript API library is now available via its web toolkit facility which will support the new add-on so developers can start exploring offline capabilities with Gears. Google CEO Eric Schmidt said: "With 'Google Gears' we are tackling a key limitation of the browser in order to make it a stronger platform for deploying all types of applications, and enabling a better user experience. "We believe strongly in the power of the community to stretch this new technology to the limits of what's possible, and ultimately emerge with an open standard that benefits everyone." According to various reports, Adobe Systems supports the new technology and is already developing its own version. Browser makers Mozilla and Opera were also said to be keen to get involved with Gears. The announcement coincided with Google Developer Day, which is taking place today at 10 cities around the world including Moscow, London, and Beijing where a whole range of Google products are being trumpeted by the firm.

Clicking on the YouTube menu gives AppleTV users access to YouTube content, streamed directly off the Internet. In another sense it&#39;s very surprising, since Apple TV seemed clearly designed to be a vehicle for playing back videos purchased on the iTunes Store, given its lack of support for popular video CODECs like DivX/Xvid. After Steve&#39;s speech, Apple also issued a press release indicating that Apple TV would get a new BTO (build to order) option, offering a 160GB internal hard drive (instead of the standard 40GB). As an Apple TV owner (more on that later) I&#39;m not sure the 160GB is necessary given the ease at which content can be streamed directly from your iTunes library, though it does address a complaint from many reviewers. This update should also quell some of the AppleTV naysayers into submission, and is a sign that Apple intends to open their borders to content that they feel suits the new TV medium. In the Q&A style interview with Walt Mossberg, Steve Jobs hinted that eventually users would be able to purchase and stream other content, but at the moment Apple feels iTunes is still the best interface to manage media. Apple also announced the immediate availability of , its DRM free music offering. If you&#39;ve already used iTunes to buy music, check out the new section as you may be able to &#39;upgrade&#39; your old 128kbps AAC files to the new 256kbps DRM free version.

As always, the seamless upgrade simply replaces your content and moves your old DRM&#39;d files in to the trash (where they belonged all the time?) Later today Steve Jobs is also going with Bill Gates in a much anticipated bout on the D5 stage. Most analysts are expecting the pair to get down and dirty.

Google Earth already displays images from the Panoramio - its photos have been a default layer in Google Earth since the beginning of the year - using location data entered by the site's users. The site also provides an API that enables web developers to embed its functionality into their own websites. In a brief statement on its homepage, Panoramio said that the deal should be concluded by the end of June. 'Today, we are pleased to announce the planned acquisition of Panoramio by Google,' it said. 'This acquisition is a great opportunity for Panoramio uploaders to leverage Google's reach, increasing the exposure of their photographs to photophiles around the world and for viewers to choose from a larger universe of photographs as Panoramio becomes more widely known.' In true Web 2.0 fashion, Google announced the takeover in its blog. John Hanke, director for Maps, Earth and Local said that images layer in Google Earth would remain in place 'as our teams work together toward further integrating this amazing content, generated by many, into our mapping technologies.' Panoramio is not alone in enabling geotagging of images to link them to maps and satellite images. Yahoo!, for one, offers a similar service to users of its Flickr website.

It is set among exhibits on frogs and lizards, across from a gift shop and a diorama of life in ancient times. But this is something different: the Creation Museum, a $27 million destination that brings a new level of high-tech polish to anti-evolution argument. The text below the display case says scientists are "puzzled" by the varieties of finches. "The Bible provides the explanation," the text continues. "In the beginning of time, six thousand years ago, God created every kind of bird, including the finch kind, and He gave them the ability to 'multiply on the Earth.' " The 60,000-square-foot museum, which opened this week on 49 acres of lush Kentucky countryside, is the work of Answers in Genesis, a leader in the "young Earth" creationist movement. Unlike proponents of intelligent design -- who question aspects of evolutionary theory but may accept that the universe is billions of years old -- members of "young Earth" groups insist that the Book of Genesis is an accurate historical record. Because history began only 6,000 years ago, they argue, dinosaurs discovered in the fossil record must have coexisted with humans. In the diorama that greets museum visitors, models of baby T. rexes cavort among animatronic children clad in buckskin. Dinosaurs, in fact, are all over the Creation Museum: Visitors can plunk down $29.99 for a plastic apatosaurus in the gift shop. Their kids will be able to saddle up on the back of a model triceratops by the coffee bar. "Kids are fascinated by them," said Ken Ham, president of Answers in Genesis, who says the creatures have too long been used as propaganda for the evolutionist cause. "We like to say, 'You've captured them for evolution, and we're going to take them back,' " Ham said. The museum, with its flat-screen TVs, coffee bar and special-effects theater, is an attempt to go mainstream with an idea that has been widely discredited by modern science. And that is a concern for defenders of evolutionary theory. Campaign to Defend the Constitution, a project of the Tides Center that advocates science education and the separation of church and state, recently compared the museum to cigarette ads focusing on the young. "This is to science what Joe Camel was to health -- a crass marketing ploy that cynically preys on the impressionable minds of children," campaign co-director Clark Stevens said in a statement. Ham, a former Australian schoolteacher who founded his ministry in 1979, said he simply wants people to "think about the origins issue" in a new way. "You have secular museums in every major city that treat evolution as fact, and public schools around this nation treating evolution as fact, and they're worried about one Creation Museum? "If evolution is so obvious," he said with a smile, "why are they so worried?" Ham believes many modern Christians have strayed from the basic tenets of their faith because they learned in school that evolution, not Genesis, provided the best blueprint for the story of creation. Creationists already boast one smaller museum, called the Museum of Creation and Earth History, in Santee (San Diego County), as well as a number of roadside attractions in the region. The Kentucky museum takes creationist tourism to a new level. Its chief designer, Patrick Marsh, designed the "Jaws" and "King Kong" attractions at Florida's Universal Studios. Organizers are expecting to attract 250,000 yearly visitors, who will pay $9.95 to $19.95 for a ticket. Beyond the diorama of the dinosaurs and children is a reproduction of a narrow slot canyon from the Grand Canyon. A video on a flat-screen television asks "Have you ever wondered where canyons come from?" laying the groundwork for a recurring assertion: that the Grand Canyon was not carved out over millions of years by the Colorado River, but by a rush of water created by the great flood described in Genesis. The Answers in Genesis group believes the story of the ark to be literally true. After the ark ran aground in Central Asia, the museum says, the surviving animals repopulated the other continents by floating across the oceans on the "billions of trees" uprooted by the great deluge. It is those kinds of assertions that make scientists such as Lawrence Krauss laugh out loud. "That's remarkable," said Krauss, a physicist and astronomer at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. "Any child knows that when they make up a story, and unfortunately make up the facts, they have to make up more and more excuses to justify those facts."

Microsoft Surface, which has a 30-inch display under a hard-plastic tabletop, allows a group of people to touch and move objects on screen at once. Microsoft is to unveil a coffee-table-shaped "surface computer" today in a major step towards co-founder Bill Gates' view of a future where the mouse and keyboard are replaced by more natural interaction using voice, pen and touch. Microsoft Surface, which has a 76cm (30-inch) display under a hard-plastic tabletop, allows people to touch and move objects on screen for everything from digital finger painting and jigsaw puzzles to ordering off a virtual menu in a restaurant. It also recognises and interacts with devices placed on its surface, so cell phone users can easily buy ringtones or change payment plans by placing their handsets on in-store displays, or a group of people gathered round the table can check out the photos on a digital camera placed on top. The world's largest software maker said it will manufacture the machine itself and sell it initially to corporate customers, deploying the first units in November in Sheraton hotels, Harrah's casinos, T-Mobile stores, and restaurants. The company is selling the Surface for between $US5,000 ($NZ6972) and $US10,000 ($NZ13,945) each, but aims to bring prices down to consumer levels in three to five years and introduce various shapes and forms. "We see this as a multibillion dollar category, and we envision a time when surface computing technologies will be pervasive, from tabletops and counters to the hallway mirror," chief executive Steve Ballmer said in a statement. Analysts say the first few applications only hint at what is possible. "The potential for the interface is huge," said Matt Rosoff, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft, an independent research firm. "Once you open it up to applications, what you can think of is limitless." Microsoft held demonstrations of the technology last week and Ballmer will officially introduce it at the Wall Street Journal's "D: All Things Digital" conference on Thursday (NZT). Microsoft shunned its usual PC manufacturing partners and decided to take control of the surface computer's hardware production using an undisclosed contract manufacturer. It will run the Windows Vista operating system. Microsoft has a mixed record with new technology. Its Zune music player has not yet become a major challenger to Apple Inc's iPod, but its Xbox 360 game console has enjoyed early success in the battle of next-generation game machines. For years Gates has championed touch-screen technology such as the tablet PC with little success, but the Surface is a totally different shape and allows for multiple users at once. In a demonstration, Microsoft placed a digital camera with a wireless chip on the tabletop. The Surface recognised the camera and sent its pictures to the display, allowing people around the table to sift through them, grabbing and turning pictures or making them bigger or smaller by spreading or narrowing their fingers. Microsoft showed in another demonstration how Deutsche Telekom cell phone operator T-Mobile USA, one of its launch partners, could deploy the computer in its stores. A customer can grab a phone off the shelf, place it on the tabletop where it will recognize the device and pop up the handset's specifications and information to the screen. For a side-by-side comparison with another phone, the customer can put down a second handset next to the first phone. "It's drop-dead simple and people really like it, because it mimics what they do in the real world," said Pete Thompson, general manager of Microsoft's surface computing business. Microsoft said at launch it will deploy a virtual concierge for Harrah's Entertainment Inc's casinos in Las Vegas and place the surface computers in the lobbies of Starwood Hotel & Resorts Worldwide Inc's Sheraton hotels. It also signed a distribution and development agreement with slot-machine maker International Game Technology.

Part of the international space station since 2000, Zvezda is only now having shields installed to fend off dangerous space junk (Image: NASA TV) New report highlights threats to space station New spacecraft fuel gauge may reduce space junk World's only space dust detector binned Two crew members ventured from the international space station on Wednesday to install metal shields designed to protect against the impact of orbital debris. Station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov floated out of an airlock on the Russian side of the station at 15.05 EDT (19.05 GMT), about an hour later than planned, due to a glitch with communications equipment. They were back inside about five and a half hours later. During the outing, the cosmonauts fitted five aluminium debris impact shields to the forward part of the crew's living quarters, a Russian-built module known as Zvezda that has been in orbit for seven years. The shields measure about 60 by 90 centimetres, and weigh up to 9 kilograms. Yurchikhin and Kotov also rerouted cables for satellite-navigation equipment that will be needed when Europe's uncrewed cargo ship makes its debut flight to the station later this year. NASA wants the Russian module upgraded to meet US safety standards. It was launched despite substandard shielding after Russia and the United States agreed to upgrade the structure once it was in orbit. That work began in 2002, but was interrupted by the 2003 Columbia disaster and subsequent grounding of the space shuttle fleet. Yurchikhin and Kotov have another spacewalk planned for June 6 to finish installing the shields, which are designed to protect against small and medium-sized particles of debris. At 17,500 miles per hour (28,162 kilometres per hour) even something as small as a fleck of paint can cause severe damage to the station. An impact with orbital debris "is our biggest risk," said Kirk Shireman, NASA's space station deputy programme manager. Other shielding upgrades to Russian-made station components are pending. If all the improvements are made, the chance a piece of debris or a micrometeoroid would puncture the station drops to 29 per cent from 55 per cent over its expected 15-year life, according to an independent task force report published in February.

Surface, a table-style PC with a touch-sensitive screen which replaces a traditional mouse and keyboard, was unveiled in California yesterday. Using a so-called "multi-touch" interface, people can move items around in front of them with their fingers or write on the table using a pen. The device, which measures 75cm (30in) across, may echo some of the earliest computer games built into the surface of pub tables, but Microsoft hopes it will launch a new generation of computers. Steve Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, said: "We envision a time when surface computing technologies will be pervasive, from tabletops and counters to the hallway mirror." The Surface table can interact with other devices such as mobile phones, music players and digital cameras. Users can place compatible gadgets on to the table and have the computer recognise them wirelessly. Matt Rosoff, an analyst with independent research group Directions on Microsoft, said: "Once you open it up to applications, what you can think of is limitless." The Surface will go on sale in the US later this year with a price tag of between $5,000 and $10,000 (&pound;2,026- &pound;5,041). But Microsoft claims that the price will drop quickly as more people buy it. Within three to five years it could be cheap enough for home users, although initially it is expected to be bought by large companies. Starwood hotels, which owns the Sheraton chain, has said it will install the Surface at its premises, and other early takers include the Las Vegas casino group Harrah's and mobile phone operator T-Mobile, which plans to use Surface PCs as displays in its high street shops. Touch screen computers have long been tipped as the next big thing, and a series of developments have pushed the technology to the forefront in recent months, including the forthcoming iPhone from Apple, which features a touchable screen instead of the buttons usually found on a mobile phone. The Surface machine can recognise several different touches at the same time, allowing people to use multiple fingers or have several people using the computer simultaneously. Stephen Brewster, of the University of Glasgow's department of computing science, said: "Using a PC is very much a solitary activity, but there's something very tangible about having something that you can share with other people."

Google to Buy Panoramio Google is acquiring Panoramio, a photo sharing site that lets user upload photos and identify where they were taken. Part 1 of a special five-part series. James Niccolai, IDG News Service Thursday, AM PDT Google Inc. is acquiring Panoramio, a photo-sharing Web site based in Spain that lets people upload photos and identify where they were taken by placing them on Google Earth or Google Maps, where they can be viewed by the public. The companies have already been working together since the start of the year, when Google made Panoramio the default photo layer for Google Earth. Panoramio has seen its usage surge since then, recently passing 1 million "geo-located" photos. In a blog posting Wednesday, Google said it was buying the company to integrate its services more closely with its own -- although it isn't saying exactly how yet -- and to boost its own technical resources. It should also help to strengthen Panoramio's infrastructure, leading to more reliable service for end users. Financial terms of the acquisition, which is pending, were not disclosed. Google said it planned to keep operating the site for now and that there won't be any immediate changes for Panoramio's users. The move should help to strengthen Google's position against Yahoo Inc. for providing online photo services. Yahoo owns the popular Flickr photo-sharing service, whose users can also locate their photos on Google Earth, although they don't appear as the default layer. Panoramio said it was "very (and we mean very) happy" to be acquired by Google. "To watch our little project grow since its conception one and a half years ago has been an amazing experience," cofounder Eduardo Manchsn wrote in a blog posting. Panoramio was launched in October 2005. About 300,000 people had signed up for the service as of March this year, and in February the site had 4 million unique visitors and 30 million page views, according to Panoramio. The company released an API (application programming interface) recently that lets other Web sites include Panoramio functionality in their site. It gave its users the option to remove all their photos and personal data before they are transferred to Google. / 1000 max characters MySpace&#039;s Parent to Buy Photobucket Google Revamps Korean Site Cisco Completes WebEx Buy FTC Investigating Google-DoubleClick Deal Google Buys Security Software Maker BMC to Buy ProactiveNet Novell: Microsoft Deal Is Good for Linux Novell says its deal with Microsoft is helping its Linux business.

The technology, called Google Gears, is intended to allow users of computers, phones and other devices to manipulate web services such as e-mail, online calendars or news readers whether online, intermittently connected to the Web or offline. By apparently bridging the gulf between new web services and the older world of desktop software, where any data changes are stored locally on users' machines, Google is pushing the web into whole new spheres of activity and posing a challenge to rival Microsoft, leader in the desktop software era. "The web is great but it doesn't work very well when you don't have a web connection. Gears addresses a functional gap," Jeff Huber, Google's vice president of engineering, said. Google plans to make the Gears technology available for free as "open source" software, meaning other developers are free to use and enhance the software in their own products. Gears promises to expand the usage of scores of Google products and services, as well as thousands of programs from independent software makers, by making them more accessible at previously inconvenient times and places. The technology also allows developers to build internet search and indexing of web pages into their own software applications, Mr Huber said. Many such products will be able to make limited searches offline, since they will have downloaded data automatically when connected. Google's full web search functions would return once the user reconnects to the Internet. Early partners who will use Gears in their products include design software leader Adobe, maker of Flash animation and Acrobat document-sharing software.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-mooney/of-idiocy-and-optimal-cli_b_50109.html&cid Chris Mooney: Of Idiocy and Optimal Climates | The Huffington Post Of Idiocy and Optimal Climates or less everywhere. NASA administrator Michael Griffin made this mind-boggling statement to NPR: I have no doubt that a trend of global warming exists. I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with. To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn't change. I guess I would ask which human beings -- where and when -- are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take. To be fair to Griffin, there's the germ of an interesting point here. Climate varied dramatically in past eras of the Earth's history. And these variations in climate have most assuredly favored some parts of the world at the expense of others. Ongoing global warming is, inevitably, going to have the same effect. There are going to be at least some winners, along with all the losers. So far so good. But as the blog Prometheus , what Griffin is ignoring is the whole issue of risk and its distribution. Our global society is set up for--adapted to--the current climate. But now we're moving in the direction of raising the sea level considerably--even as much of the global population is coastal--and melting large amounts of ice, while also altering the occurrence of phenomena, such as droughts, that could have a dramatic impact on food and water supplies. How can anyone think this is not a tremendous societal risk, even if there might be some people--in, say, Buffalo, New York--who may actually have more pleasant weather under global warming? NASA is already backtracking. James Hansen, the agency's top climatologist, is . Assuredly there will be many more jeers and groans over the course of the day. But let's not forget the big picture. Michael Griffin said something obtuse in one press interview. But the Bush administration has more or less acted, for seven years, as if it agrees with him.

(AP / Ed Reinke) 'Twenty-seven million dollars could have gone towards a lot of other things other than propping up a fairy tale,' said one man. Eugenie Scott of the U.S. National Center for Science Education. Bible-based creation museum has dinosaurs Updated Mon. May. 28 2007 11:32 PM ET A new theme park that features the Bible as a literal story, albeit one in which children cavort with dinosaurs, has opened in northern Kentucky. "We wanted to show people there's no mystery with dinosaurs, we can explain them," said Ken Ham, founder of the Answers in Genesis Ministry. The non-profit group created the US$27 million Creation Museum, but protestors said the money could have been better spent. "Twenty-seven million dollars could have gone towards a lot of other things other than propping up a fairy tale," said one man. The dinosaur exhibit is at odds with scientists who say that the massive lizards existed tens of millions of years before man. In the literal interpretation of the Bible, however, dinosaurs were created by God at the same time as all the other animals just a few thousand years ago. "People are just fascinated by dinosaurs, but they've sort of become synonymous with millions of years and evolution," Ham said. The 5,600-square-metre facility rebuts the theory of evolution. Ham claims the Bible's stories about the world being created in six days are supported by science. At the website of the Royal Tyrrell Museum in the fossil hotbed of Drumheller, Alta., it says, "There's been life on Earth for more than 3.9 billion years, so we have a lot to show you!" One exhibit offers a chance to view "a giant recreation of underwater life from 350 million years ago." While the Tyrrell museum has dinosaur skeletons, Ham hired Patrick Marsh, who designed the "Jaws" monster at Universal Studios in Florida, to oversee the animatronic exhibits, including dinosaurs. Eugenie Scott of the U.S. National Center for Science Education fears students who visit the Creation Museum will "show up in classrooms and say, 'gee, Mrs. Brown, I went to this spiffy museum last summer and they say that everything you're teaching me is a lie." The museum contains fossils, but Ham said most were created by the massive flood described in the book of Genesis. "They can believe whatever they want to believe about when dinosaurs were created and when humans were created," said Jeffrey McKee, an anthropologist at Ohio State University. "The fact is that dinosaurs went extinct long before humans were around." Ham is originally from Australia and began developing the idea of a creationist museum in the early 1990s. Donations have been sufficient to allow the museum to open debt-free. "Christians across this nation see this place as a rallying point," Ham said. They "recognize that we live in a culture that no longer believes the Bible is true."

Likewise, there's been a lot of speculation as to how security and privacy are going to be dealt with on the social networking sites that draw information from these web apps.Â Â  I saw this at work earlier this week with the announcement of the alpha launch of social networking site at Where 2.0. As if the standard security issues aren't tricky enough when it comes to the average site, Fatdoor's mashup of Live Earth aerial images with wiki versions of users' neighborhoods has a lot of hand wringing going on. To address these issues I went straight to the source and had a chat with Fatdoor CEO Raj Abhyanker yesterday afternoon about the security protocols that the site has in place. A lot of the potential problems I posed in an are common concerns according to Abhyanker, but he assured me that he's done his homework.Â  "The thing that really gets people feeling uneasy is seeing an icon on the map. They instantly think that their icon is going to float over their actual street address, but that's not the case. . .we actually have less information displayed than Google's white pages," said Abhyanker. It wasn't until Abhyanker let me take his neighborhood for a test drive that I started to understand how this actually plays out. Fatdoor is hardly the stalking tool we all feared. In fact, its simple interface made Abhyanker's own community fit together more like a wiki version of a town hall. Users in the neighborhood can broadcast general messages to the entire block, submit an entry about a local business, or even submit entries for friends and other neighbors. Abhyanker's neighborhood is even set up to elect moderators to help police this conduct too. Paired with the amount of control the user has over how much or how little information the neighborhood can access about themselves, it actually seemed....pretty safe. As far as peeking into other neighborhoods? Abhyanker has that covered too. "We've been playing around with the distance, and after some testing we've found that keeping it at a 5 mile radius [from the user's residence] is the most reasonable," he said. "It keeps the focus on the neighborhood and also keeps the feeling of community. Of course, this is something that we're going to have to change depending on the size and layout of a city, but during testing it seemed like the ideal distance." With that said, it'll be interesting to see how Abhyanker's social experiment comes together. Although social networking sites like Myspace and Facebook are great for connecting people, few have attempted to tackle the relevance of building out the social networks right outside our doorsteps. Still, it's good to know that even though Abhyanker and his crew have decided to bring social networking a little closer to home, you can still draw the blinds every once in a while.

Feature Wars Intensify in Mapping Tech May 30, 2007 9:34AM With Microsoft introducing new 3D map options and Google rolling out Street View mapping technology, some are wondering what the possible ROI for these features might be. According to analyst Greg Sterling, the steady introduction of new mapping features is driven to a large extent by competition rather than by an expectation of revenue. Feds Arrest 'Spam King' in Seattle IRS Spoof Targets Execs Through RTF CDW Accepts $7.3 Billion To Go Private Palm Foleo: A 'Smartphone Companion' Samsung Debuts 4-GB Mobile Chipset According to the great British satirist Douglas Adams, the stages of a civilization can be summarized in three questions: 1. How can we eat? (Survival); 2. Why do we eat? (Inquiry); and 3. Where shall we have lunch? (Sophistication). It's the last of those questions -- the search for a good place to eat -- that is driving the most recent Web battle: the push to make online mapping services increasingly sophisticated and user-friendly. Both Google, which operates Google Maps, and , which runs Live Search Maps, announced new features on Tuesday that are designed to help users plan trips, get previews of where they are going, and, most importantly, find businesses that might be persuaded to advertise with the mapping services. Two weeks ago, Google signaled the intensity of its work in this area by launching the Google Lat Long Blog, devoted specifically to the company's work on its maps, Google Earth, its local map service, and related APIs. "Things are changing so fast," said John Hanke, the Director of Google Earth and Maps, in the blog's initial post, "we thought a blog focused on this topic would be the best way to communicate with you, both about our products and about the overall development of geo on the Web." At the Where 2.0 conference on Tuesday, Hanke rolled out two new Google developments: "Street View" and "Mapplets." The Street View feature offers map users 360 degree images of streets in various urban areas around the country. Initially, images are available for portions of the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver, and Miami, with other areas to be added later. If street level views are available for a particular area, a new button labeled "Street View" will appear on the Google map. Users can click on the image, pan in every direction, and even move forward or back, creating the illusion of walking down the street. The other feature introduced by Google, Mapplets, is designed to help developers and consumers create mini-applications that can be embedded on Google Maps to provide information or perform simple tasks. Three sample applications demonstrated by Google included real estate listings, movie times, and a distance-measurement tool. In its press release, Google said that several of its partners, including WeatherBug and Booking.com, have already created customized Mapplets. "Maps are an enormously popular application," said Greg Sterling, an Internet search analyst and founder of Sterling Market Intelligence. "They've proven to draw millions of users. In fact, Google Maps may be its most successful product, apart from search. These new features are designed to reinforce that usage."

In an interview broadcast this morning on National Public Radio's "Morning Edition" program, Griffin was asked by NPR's Steve Inskeep whether he is concerned about global warming. "I have no doubt that a trend of global warming exists," Griffin told Inskeep. "I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with." "To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn't change," Griffin said. "I guess I would ask which human beings â where and when â are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take." Griffin's comments immediately drew stunned reaction from James Hansen, NASA's top climate scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. "It's an incredibly arrogant and ignorant statement," Hansen told ABC News. "It indicates a complete ignorance of understanding the implications of climate change." Hansen believes Griffin's comments fly in the face of well-established scientific knowledge that hundreds of NASA scientists have contributed to. "It's unbelievable," said Hansen. "I thought he had been misquoted. It's so unbelievable." News media inquiries to NASA headquarters about Griffin's comments prompted the space agency to make the unusual move of issuing a news release late Wednesday night. "NASA is the world's preeminent organization in the study of Earth and the conditions that contribute to climate change and global warming," Griffin said in a statement. "The agency is responsible for collecting data that is used by the science community and policy makers as part of an ongoing discussion regarding our planet's evolving systems. It is NASA's responsibility to collect, analyze and release information. It is not NASA's mission to make policy regarding possible climate change mitigation strategies. As I stated in the NPR interview, we are proud of our role and I believe we do it well."

http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-whales31may31,0,5041629.story%3Fcoll%3Dla-home-center&cid Once-wayward humpbacks appear to be home free - Los Angeles Times 9:13 AM PDT, Sell & More Deals at Local Stores California | Local News Once-wayward humpbacks appear to be home free With no whales in sight, experts assume that the mother and calf have safely made it back to the Pacific. By Eric Bailey, Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTO &#8212; They came, they wandered, they went. After a 17-day sojourn in Northern California's inland waterways, two wayward humpback whales that caught the attention of the nation appear to have quietly slipped back into the Pacific Ocean. By late Wednesday, nearly 24 hours after they were last sighted off the Marin County town of Tiburon, the mother and her calf were nowhere to be seen. Most of the experts mounting a rescue operation concluded that the pair had found their way back to their ocean home. A pair of patrol boats from the U.S. Coast Guard and California Department of Fish and Game hunted the waters off the coast for any sign of the pair, while vessels crisscrossing San Francisco Bay were asked to notify authorities of any sighting. Not a tail slap, spout or sky-scratching breach was seen. "They arrived here quietly, and if they've made their way outside the Golden Gate, they've gone out quietly," said Bernadette Fees, a state Fish and Game spokeswoman. First spotted swimming languidly May 13, the pair arrived in the Sacramento River sporting deep gashes likely inflicted by a run-in with a ship. They wandered into a deep-water shipping channel and into the Port of Sacramento, meandering 70 miles from the sea. In the days that followed, whale experts from around the nation descended on the area to lend a hand. The rescue team received thousands of e-mails and calls from the public, expressing concern and offering suggestions. Northern Californians took off workdays to perch on riverbank levees to get a glimpse. Experts faced a tough balance between giving the whales room to relax and heal and trying to persuade them to head back to their natural saline environment, where their wounds would better heal. The rescue team used clanking pipes, recordings of killer whales and even the geyser spray of a fireboat in an unsuccessful bid to prod the whales past what became their biggest obstacle &#8212; a bustling bridge at Rio Vista. Scientists grew worried late last week as the pair's health continued to deteriorate. By the weekend, the team resorted to administering a dose of antibiotics &#8212; a first for whales in the wild &#8212; delivered with foot-long syringes shot from a .22-caliber rifle. They prepared to launch a massive post-Memorial Day push to move the whales. The whales beat them to the punch. On Sunday, they made their break amid the buzz of holiday jet skiers and boaters on the river. Over three days, they moved purposefully down the river, through the narrow Carquinez Strait and into San Francisco Bay. Seeming to gain vigor, the 20-foot-long juvenile put on a display of leaps and tail slaps as if at play. Tara Cahn, a Sausalito architect, jumped in her car upon learning that the whales were swimming along the Marin County coast. After a few wrong turns, she finally tracked them down Tuesday evening about a quarter-mile offshore of Tiburon. "They were bouncing around, they were playing, they were spouting," said Cahn, who on Wednesday was out looking for them again. "I've been whale watching on Monterey Bay, and this was far more exciting." Scientists say the pair's health rebounded after they returned to the bay's soothing saltwater. Their skin, which grew pitted during their trip up the Sacramento River, was looking slick and slippery by Tuesday evening. "We're still holding our breath a little bit, but we're just so pleased," said Trevor Spradlin, a marine mammal biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, the federal agency that helped lead the rescue effort. Spradlin said scientists are coming away with a treasure trove of insights and observations that will fuel months of research. "We will rigorously and systematically document this case. Really, the only other reference point was Humphrey, and that was a long time ago," he said, referring to the wayward humpback that spent nearly a month in the delta in 1985.

You can check out the video via Several comparisons of different graphics technologies have been observed this week, with stunning photo comparing real-life to Crysis, coming to our attention first. Start saving for a new PC. Of more interest to people fending off the desire to upgrade to Vista, Nzone has two videos ( ) demostrating differences between DirectX9 and DirectX10, though incrysis notes the footage is outdated. The differences are fairly pronounced, but we're sure they would be even more pronounced if it wasn't for the compressed video. One of our favourite games is receiving a new expansion pack, and have the full low-down of Civilization IV: Beyond The Sword. We can't wait. Lets hope it isn't delayed in a similar way to Halo 2 on the PC. Microsoft has revealed that the discovery of content featuring "partial nudity" was the reason the Windows Vista version of Halo 2 was delayed even longer than expected. Rumour has it, via , that according to a GameFAQs forum member, the latest issue of PSM revives the PS3 Sixaxis rumble rumors, hinting once again that Sony could integrate the "last-gen feature" into upcoming controllers. According to the magazine's rumor section, Sony will announce rumble support at E3 for a release in mid-November. The re-designed controller will allow both tilting and rumble, united at long last thanks to the settled courtroom battle between Sony and Immersion. on the 80GB Playstation 3 announced for release in Korea earlier on this week, but that didn't stop further speculation as to when or if the sizeable hard-drive would see the light of day anywhere else. Sonyâs decision to release an 80GB hard drive equipped Playstation 3 model in Korea next month may have been informed by its plans to offer video on demand (VOD) services throughout the region via PS3s. , Sony has announced its intentions to offer VOD services via Playstation 3 consoles if negotiations with a number of Korean telecoms companies proceed as expected. âWe are contacting some Korean firms in order to incorporate VOD applications into Playstation 3 service line-up,'' Sony spokeswoman Park Seo-yun said. The report states that at least two domestic landline telecom carriers, Hanaro Telecom and KT, appear to be involved in the negotiations. A Hanaro spokesman said, âWe are negotiating with Sony and the atmosphere is pretty good. We hope we will be able to reach an agreement in June.' We'd presume, that similar to Microsoft, Sony is in discussions with television providers all over the world in an attempt to line-up VOD over the Xbox 360 and PS3 respectively. Sony has said that the company could release the 80GB Playstation 3 outside South Korea - but there are currently no plans to do so. As reported by the Washington Post, spokesperson Satoshi Fukuoka said, "At this time there are no concrete plans [to sell the model in other markets]. "However," he added, "It could be an option to introduce it in other regions but it needs to be decided by each region." Similarly to reporting the 80GB HDD news, the INQ also the 1.80 firmware upgrade that was released for the PS3, but if you want to see actual pictures of the firmware in action, head on over to SCEE and BT have signed a deal that will 'transform' the Playstation Portable into a mobile communications device by incorporating wireless broadband communications functions into the handheld. The four year deal will enable users to make video calls, voice calls and send messages over the internet from home or BT wireless hotspots. The service will utilize the upcoming PSP camera and microphone and will initially be promoted across the UK.

Three pins from have been physically cut from a surface-mounted IC, which ensures the mod chips aren't able to function. Modders are expected to either get round the problem, or produce new chips that circumvent the IC. George Harrison senior vice president of marketing at Nintendo of America has said the company is targeting sales of 35 million Wiis in the US, close to the 38.2 million PS2s sold by Sony in the region. Speaking to Bloomberg, he said the ambitious target would be met by 2011 or 2012. "Demand is much greater than we anticipated," Harrison said. "A year ago no one thought we would be in this position." This should be partly fuelled by the strong line-up Nintendo announced for 2007. Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Super Mario Galaxy and DS title The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass are all on track for release this year. Metroid Prime 3: Corruption has been given a 20th August release in the US. EA hopes to revitalize the aging Sims franchise with the DS and Wii title MySims - a game that, on the surface, looks a lot like Nintendo software.

The revelation is the latest twist in the ongoing struggle between backers of the open source Linux operating system and Microsoft, the largest developer of proprietary software. For years, Microsoft has asserted that certain parts of Linux, among other open source programs, violate its patents, but it has made little effort to detail which parts, let alone stop the violations by taking vendors or users to court to obtain royalties. Last November, the company took a big step forward when it signed a with Novell to come to an agreement over intellectual property rights, the supposed IP violations, and to put customers who use both Windows and SuSE Linux at ease about possibly being sued. As part of the deal, Microsoft agreed to distribute coupons that its customers could use to purchase SuSE Linux Enterprise Server from Novell, the idea being that Microsoft would not sue these Linux customers for using software that infringes upon its patents, because it has been compensated for them through cross-licensing payments SuSE made to Microsoft. Because of this deal, other Linux vendors, notably , were put on a different level than Novell and SuSE. It also left open the possibility that Microsoft may come looking for compensation for the supposed IP violations being perpetuated by other Linux users around the globe. Microsoft has indicated that it doesn't want to resolve the situation through lawsuits, but instead would rather set up deals similar to the one with Novell to get other Linux vendors and users on the up and up with its IP--something that the Linux and open source communities have strongly objected to. (However, when Microsoft said the deal was a de facto admission by Novell that SuSE Linux violated Microsoft's IP, it really put the fork in potential deals with Red Hat and others.) While all this was going on, the backers of the GNU General Purpose License (GPL)--the licensing scheme under which Linux is distributed--have been seething at Novell's actions, and plotting to find a way to get back at Microsoft and its perceived weakening of the GPL and Linux through Novell's deal with Microsoft. The (FSF), which controls the GPL, has plotted to add elements to the new GPL v3 proposal that would put an end to the deal and force Microsoft out of the Linux business--or bend it to its open-source persuasion. What the FSF came up with was a plan that would make Microsoft subject to the GPL by emphasizing its role as a Linux distributor. Since the GPL strictly forbids patents, if Microsoft continued to distribute Linux through the SuSE coupon deal, it would legally block Microsoft from seeking compensation for supposed violations of its patents, not only from Novell SuSE customers, but from all Linux users. This is the gist behind GPL v3, and because GPL has teeth and is enforceable in a court of law, it may just work. And that's the fear that Microsoft has with GPL v3, which is expected to go into force in July, although it's still not clear if Linus Torvalds, the primary developer of Linux, will adopt GPL v3 for the ongoing distribution of the Linux kernel. Torvalds last year with GPL v3, and pledged to continue to distribute the Linux kernel under GPL v2. But in the end, it likely won't matter, because many elements of a Linux distribution will be licensed under GPL v3 anyway, giving it teeth whether the kernel is licensed under GPL v3 or not. According to its 2006 annual report Novell filed with the Security and Exchange Commission on Friday, Microsoft may call off at least part of the deal with Novell if those provisions of the GPL go into effect with v3. "If the final version of GPLv3 contains terms or conditions that interfere with our agreement with Microsoft or our ability to distribute GPLv3 code, Microsoft may cease to distribute SuSE Linux coupons in order to avoid the extension of its patent covenants to a broader range of GPLv3 software recipients," Novell stated in the document. Despite the sour treatment Novell has received from Microsoft and the pressure from the open source community, Novell is committed to the deal. Whether outside forces like the GPL v3 ultimately end it has yet to be seen.

First look: iTunes Plus Apple made good on its promise to add unprotected tracks to its online digital media store Wednesday. As expected, individual unprotected tracks are available for $1.29. Part 1 of a special five-part series. Wednesday, May 30, 2007 12:00 PM PDT A month ago, Apple and EMI announced that the record label would offer its entire catalog sans digital rights management protection at the iTunes Store sometime in May. With just a full day left in the month, Apple made good on the promise, adding these unprotected tracks--termed iTunes Plus--to its online digital media store Wednesday. As expected, individual unprotected tracks are available for US$1.29 per track while albums are offered at the same price as the protected version. Individual protected tracks continue to be priced at 99-cents per track. I've spent the better part of the morning cruising the Store's aisles to see just how iTunes Plus works. Here's what I've learned. In order to purchase iTunes Plus tracks you must upgrade to iTunes 7.2. Although an iTunes Plus link appears in the Quick Links area of earlier versions of iTunes, when you click it, you're instructed that you must upgrade to iTunes 7.2 to view iTunes Plus music. Once you've installed iTunes 7.2, that link takes you to the iTunes Plus page, which holds What's Hot and Featured Albums boxes similar to those on the Store's main page as well as Top Albums and Top Songs columns that list pretty much what their titles suggest. The page also contains a Genre pop-up menu, from which you can choose Alternative, Blues, Children's Music, Classical, Comedy, Country, Dance, Electronic, Folk, Hip-Hop/Rap, Holiday, Christian &amp; Gospel, Jazz, New Age, Opera, Pop, R&B/Soul, Reggae, Rock, Soundtrack, Spoken Word, Vocal, World, and iTunes Latino genres. Choose a genre and the contents of the What's Hot and Featured Albums boxes changes to reflect popular and featured albums within that genre. Shortly after iTunes Plus became available I looked through some of the categories and they show some growing pains. For example, much as I like Brian Eno's Thursday Afternoon and The Residents' Third Reich 'n' Roll I'm not sure they belong among the Store's featured classical albums. When you click on an album on the iTunes Plus page, you're asked if you'd like to set your iTunes Plus preference. If you click the iTunes Plus button at the bottom of the dialog box, you'll always be shown the iTunes Plus version of a music track or music video if one is available. Click Cancel and you'll continue to be offered protected tracks, though you'll be told that an album is also available in an iTunes Plus version (accompanied by a Learn More link that, once again, offers you the opportunity to enable the iTunes Plus preference). If you choose to enable that preference you can switch it off only from your iTunes Store account page where you access the option via a Manage iTunes Plus button. Regrettably, with iTunes Plus preferences enabled you're not shown the less-expensive protected version of the track. Likewise, with iTunes Plus disabled, you're not provided with links to the DRM-free tracks unless you click that Learn More link and, in the subsequent window, click the iTunes Plus button to enable the iTunes Plus preference. Among the few glitches I encountered shortly after the launch of iTunes Plus was an error dialog box that appeared whenever I attempted to change my iTunes Plus preferences. Fortunately, the error is in error. When I either enabled or disabled the preference, the new preference stuck, despite the error suggesting that there was a problem. Downloading an iTunes Plus track or album works almost exactly as does downloading protected tracks--the one thing you can't currently do is gift unprotected music as you can with the Store's protected music. A small iTunes Plus caption appears just above the Buy Album button on an album's page and a Plus icon followed by the $1.29 price sits to the left of each track's Buy Song button. Click one of these buttons and, by default, you're prompted for your ID and password, and your media downloads to your computer. The resulting files are encoded at a bit rate of 256kbps and are tagged with a .m4a extension. (This is the extension for unprotected AAC files, versus the .m4p extension appended to the Store's protected AAC files.) A four-minute track weighs in at just over 8MB. When signed into the Store, click the iTunes Plus link and you should see an Upgrade My Library area in the upper right corner of the resulting iTunes Plus windows. (I say should because, early in my testing, this disappeared from time to time.) This area was designed to make it easy to upgrade compatible contents of your iTunes Library to an unprotected form. Albums can be upgraded for 30-percent of the current album price, upgrades to individual music tracks cost 30 cents per track, and upgrading music videos costs 60 cents per video. So, for example, if you have a copy of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon in the old protected format, you can upgrade to the unprotected version for 30-percent of the current $7.99 album price. Under the Upgrade My Library heading you'll view a See Details button as well as the total number of songs and albums you can upgrade along with the price for doing so. Unfortunately, you can't upgrade individual tracks or albums--this is an all-or-nothing option for your entire compatible library. However, you're not forced to upgrade an entire album if you've purchased only a few tracks on it. In this case, you have to upgrade only those tracks you've purchased. Click the See Details button, and you're taken to a page that lists all the albums and tracks that can be upgraded. Click the Buy button and everything is upgraded to the iTunes Plus version. Before iTunes begins downloading the tracks, you're told that the old versions will be removed from your iTunes library. You have the option to direct iTunes to toss those tracks in the Trash or move them to your Desktop. In both cases, the tracks will appear in an Original iTunes Purchases folder, organized by Artist and Album folders. So, for example, within the Original iTunes Purchases folder, you'll find an Al Green folder that contains a folder for the Reverend's I Can't Stop album. With a tiny measure of luck, the upgraded versions of the tracks will download to your computer. I mention luck because, early in iTunes Plus' short life, this was a hit-or-miss affair for me. Of the 48 tracks I attempted to upgrade, 14 failed with an unknown (504) error. These were tracks from the aforementioned Al Green album and Brian Eno and J. Peter Schwalm's Drawn From Life. Subsequent attempts to download the tracks failed as well. I had no problems upgrading the Rolling Stones' Jump Back and the Berlin Philharmonic's recording of Brahms' A German Requiem. The total price of all this upgrading: $13.46. As I mentioned, non-protected tracks are encoded at 256kbps--that's twice the 128kbps bit-rate that protected songs are encoded at. Using iTunes I burned both protected and the new unprotected versions of The Stones' Jump Back and Brahms' Requiem to CD to see how they sounded through the Denon amplifier, Sony CD player, and B&W speakers in my living room. I wish I could say that the difference between the two versions was like night and day, but it wasn't. Bearing in mind that everyone's hearing is different and therefore my conclusions are purely subjective, in comparison to the protected versions, the DRM-free versions of the recordings sounded like a thin layer of film was washed away from them. In the Requiem, for example, you could more easily hear the bows' rosin and the distinct overtones of the timpani rather than their less-distinct thump in the protected version. And passages where the choir and orchestra are going at full force, the unprotected version sounds less confused--you can more easily pick out voices and instruments rather than being overwhelmed with waves of sound. Given that the Stones produce some of the dirtiest recordings in the business, I understand that using their music--some of it recorded decades ago--is an odd way to test the quality of a recording. Yet comparing the two versions of "Angie," I could more distinctly hear the tap on the cymbal's bell and closed high-hat and the 12-string guitar rings a bit more clearly. And, as with the Requiem, the various parts are a touch easier to discern. Will you hear a difference, and is that difference worth an extra 30-cents-per-track? It depends on the gear you use to listen to your music and the keenness of your hearing. Given that the earbuds bundled with the iPod are hardly audiophile quality, you're unlikely to get your money's worth listening to unprotected tracks with this kind of setup. On higher-end gear--good headphones or quality stereo speakers--you might find these tracks more to your liking. Again, the difference between protected and unprotected versions is anything but startling, but if you've stayed away from the Store in the past because you're unhappy with the quality of its tracks, you may find those offered in unprotected form more pleasing. I'll continue monitoring iTunes Plus and, with my company's gracious permission, download and scrutinize a variety of iTunes' unprotected tracks and music videos.

The spacewalkers will install Service Module Debris Protection (SMDP) panels on the Zvezda service module and reroute a Global Positioning System antenna cable during their estimated six-hour spacewalk. (Xinhua/Reuters Photo) BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhuanet) -- Protective panels designed to shield the international space station from harmful space debris were installed Wednesday by two Russian cosmonauts. Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov exited a hatch on the Russian side of the space station at 3:05 p.m. EDT. The spacewalk lasted about five and a half hours. Both men were tethered during the spacewalk to keep them from floating away. The station's third occupant, U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams, remained inside. Space debris includes objects such as discarded rocket parts, planetary dust and rocks. Scientists consider it the greatest threat to the space station, orbiting about 220 miles (350 kilometers) above Earth. The 17 protective panels, each about 2 feet by 3 feet (60 by 90 centimeters) and weighing about 20 pounds (9 kilograms), were delivered to the station last December and left outside in a formation called "the Christmas tree." The cosmonauts installed five of the panels on a Russian section of the space station, and the others were to be put in place during a spacewalk next week. The cosmonauts also successfully rerouted a cable for a navigation antenna that will be used later in the year for the first flight of a new European cargo vehicle. Wednesday's spacewalk was the first of two scheduled a week apart. Yurchikhin and Kotov will perform another one next Wednesday with similar tasks, including depositing canisters containing biological experiments outside the station.

Savner has said he doesn't think it would be enough to stimulate sales of the console significantly. "Despite growing anticipation that a $100 price cut for the PS3 is imminent this summer or early fall, we do not believe such a move would meaningfully improve stagnant PS3 sales and we are growing more concerned that a share shift away from Sony and Microsoft to Nintendo's Wii platform is incrementally negative of all third-party publishers," Savner said. He continued by describing a $50 cut "as meaningless" and added that it's down to the games to put PS3 back in the spotlight. "Based on our analysis, we conclude that a $100 price cut for the PS3 (we have dismissed a potential $50 cut as meaningless) would still leave the 'all-in' cost for a PS3 console and basic accoutrements 20-25% higher than the comparable Xbox 360, and does not even reflect the possibility that Microsoft could also lower its hardware prices. "Further, an important driver of Sony hardware last cycle was exclusive games, such as Grand Theft Auto. Unfortunately, Sony does not have a similar advantage this cycle. Halo 3, a highly anticipated game release this year is a Microsoft-published game only for the Xbox, and Grand Theft Auto IV, by Take-Two's Rockstar unit, is being released on both the Sony and Xbox platforms." Savner believes that Sony has made a number of mistakes and consumers are more price sensitive than Sony anticipated. To make up more ground, Savner says Sony would actually need a $200 price cut, but doesn't see that happening.

The reports coming out is that the American helicopter was shot down by Taliban fighters who had some new weapon technology. The Canadian soldier killed was Master Cpl. Darrell Jason Priede. He brings the Canadian death toll up to 56 since the initiative began in Afghanistan in 2002. While troops headed to the crash site of the helicopter they were also ambushed by insurgents. An air strike helped eliminate the threat, but damage was done. Priede was a combat cameraman who was working around the Kajaki dam. The dam is being repaired to supply electricity to Kandahar. &#8220;In working to bring peace to this troubled country, he has ended up paying the ultimate sacrifice,&#8221; said Brig.-Gen. Tim Grant, head of Canada&#8217;s Afghanistan task force. &#8220;There is no way to comfort those who grieve at this terrible time. However, we should all remember that Darrell was involved in a good thing, a good fight and we should be proud of what he has done.&#8221; It is always sad news to hear the death of a Canadian soldier or any solder for that matter as conditions are still very unfavorable in the region.

Sure, that&#8217;s George Lucas up there on stage, but isn&#8217;t that Martha Stewart? And there&#8217;s Steve Ballmer of Microsoft, but the crowd listening to him includes former RIAA executive Hilary Rosen and &#8220;Men in Black&#8221; director Barry Sonnenfeld. When George Lucas came on stage Wednesday evening, there was polite applause. Likewise for other speakers such as Senator John McCain, Cisco CEO John Chambers, and CBS President Leslie Moonves. Even Steve Jobs&#8217; early-afternoon session was not preceded by the kind of anticipation that one sees outside a Macworld Expo keynote address. joint evening appearance of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates ? The feeling was electric, even for this high-tech, high-powered crowd. Even 15 minutes before showtime, the sheer anticipation in the audience was more like the vibe you&#8217;d get from a rock concert than from a sedate sit-down with two writers and two technology billionaires. And the pair of billionaires did not disappoint. Well, to be fair, they probably disappointed anyone who expected this to be the sort of event where two men enter and one man leaves. This was not a no-holds-barred battle of wits. Instead, it was a fascinating opportunity to view two men who are very much in the public eye, perhaps destined to be inextricably linked to one another in the history books, interact with each other for the first time in a public setting in a decade. What struck me most about Jobs&#8217;s and Gates&#8217;s interaction with one another was the genuine warmth they both felt when nostalgically recalling the early days of the personal computer revolution, when Microsoft supplied a version of the BASIC programming language for the Apple II and then became one of the flagship application developers for the very first Mac. In an industry that has trouble remembering what happened last week, these men have 30 years of history &#8212; much of it good, believe it or not. As Jobs eloquently put it: &#8220;When Bill and I first met each other and worked together in the early days, generally we were both the youngest guys in the room. And now, when we&#8217;re working at our companies, I don&#8217;t know about [Bill], but I&#8217;m the oldest guy in the room sometimes&#8230; there&#8217;s that one line in that one Beatles, &#8216;You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead.&#8217; And that clearly is true here.&#8221; It&#8217;s easy to portray these two as bitter rivals, and their two companies certainly provide contrasting styles and approaches to technology that match the personalities of their founders. Jobs showed himself to be a very thoughtful, almost philosophical speaker at times. Likewise true to form, Gates exposed his unabashed geeky love of the nuts and bolts of the engineering behind the technology. But both seemed to recognize the strengths of the other. For me, the most telling statement of the night was from Gates, when each man was asked about what he admired about the other. &#8220;I&#8217;d give a lot to have Steve&#8217;s taste, his intuitive taste, both for people and products,&#8221; said Gates. He told a story about one of those early meetings when the original Mac was being developed, in which Gates would approach problems from a technical perspective, as &#8220;an engineering guy.&#8221; And in contrast, he&#8217;d see Steve Jobs make an intuitive decision, based on &#8220;his sense of people&#8221; and how they&#8217;d respond to using the technology. &#8220;And it was magical,&#8221; Gates recalled. &#8220;Wow!&#8221; Jobs, hearkening back to Apple&#8217;s decision not to license the Mac OS to other hardware companies, which led to the rise of Microsoft Windows, said that he regretted that Apple had too much of a lone-wolf mentality in those days. &#8220;Because Woz and I started the company based on doing the whole banana, we weren&#8217;t so good at partnering with people&#8230;. And if Apple had more of that in its DNA, it would&#8217;ve served us really well. And [Apple] didn&#8217;t learn that until a couple decades later.&#8221; This is not to say that the night was entirely a love-fest, not on where Jobs likened the Windows version of iTunes to &#8220;giving a glass of icewater to somebody in hell.&#8221; (Video highlights of Jobs&#8217;s solo appearance is embedded below, courtesy of the D conference. Warning: the video will probably be preceded by an ad. This is one of the many reasons why Rupert Murdoch wants to pay a big pile of money for the Wall Street Journal.) Most notably the pair clashed about, of all things, Apple&#8217;s successful series of television ads featuring the Mac Guy (Justin Long) and the PC Guy (John Hodgman). Gates was visibly uncomfortable during the entire discussion of the ads, not buying Jobs&#8217;s suggestion that &#8220;The art of those commercials is not to be mean, but is actually for the guys to like each other.&#8221; When both Jobs and co-moderator Kara Swisher expressed that they liked the PC guy, Gates shot back, &#8220;His mother loves him.&#8221; And when Jobs carted out his well-worn Alan Kay quote about people who make software desiring to design their own hardware, Gates let rip with another dry rejoinder: &#8220;I can resist that.&#8221; But Gates did admit that, in certain areas, Apple&#8217;s approach to unified hardware and software design was appropriate, which is why Microsoft has adopted it for products such as the Zune, Xbox, and the new However, the pair did find a lot of common ground, especially when defending the honor of the technology product that defines both of them: the personal computer. While excitedly discussing the future of tiny, &#8220;post-PC&#8221; devices, Jobs and Gates both said that the death of the PC is probably a long way off. Gates ticked off other devices that were going to kill the PC, like the network computer, and the single-function computer. Jobs said that &#8220;the PC will continue to be with us, and it&#8217;ll morph with us.&#8221; But Jobs also showed a greater enthusiasm for the possibilities in those new devices, such as the iPod and the iPhone. They also both defended the evolution of the computer operating system, after co-moderator Walt Mossberg suggested that innovation in the computer interface has largely stalled since the introduction of the Mac in 1984. Jobs suggested that if you disappeared for 10 years and then returned, you&#8217;d notice the incremental improvements that have been happening on our desktops. Gates, completely in character, expressed enthusiasm for new technologies such as speech recognition and computer vision. But he also expressed excitement for the concept of a 3-D interface design where, for example, an online bookstore could have &#8212; wait for it &#8212; a 3-D representation of real books! Amazon take note &#8212; or don&#8217;t. As both men pointed out, one of the challenges of being the vendor of a computer operating system and software programs is that you&#8217;ve got a base of users who won&#8217;t accept radical change. As Jobs put it, even if it&#8217;s better to drive a car with six wheels and steer it via a joystick, people won&#8217;t accept those changes. They like four-wheeled cars you drive with a steering wheel. So the changes in our desktops (3-D bookshelves aside) will be more incremental, while standalone devices like the iPhone and Microsoft Surface will have more radical concepts. Ultimately, did this Gates-Jobs joint appearance live up to the electricity in the room beforehand? Even though it was a relatively gentle kind of evening, I&#8217;d have to say yes. To see these two icons of the computer industry, reacting to one another and playing off each other, in an informal setting free of PR handlers, was a chance to peek through their shells a little bit. And what we got was a good glimpse at two men who genuinely love technology and are driven by their enthusiasm in the work they have chosen. As Jobs himself said, &#8220;I sort of look at us as two of the luckiest guys on the planet.&#8221; (More coverage, including a forthcoming video and full transcript, will be available on the 17 Comments on this story Email this story to a friend Enter your trial subscription and Macworld will rush you a FREE TRIAL ISSUE.

DRM-Free Music Now Available on iTunes May 30, 2007 10:00AM With the release of iTunes Plus, customers can download DRM-free tracks from EMI artists without limitations on the type of music player or number of computers on which the purchased songs can be played; the iTunes Plus songs will play on all iPods, Macs, Windows PCs, as well as many other digital music players. Feds Arrest 'Spam King' in Seattle IRS Spoof Targets Execs Through RTF CDW Accepts $7.3 Billion To Go Private Palm Foleo: A 'Smartphone Companion' Samsung Debuts 4-GB Mobile Chipset On Wednesday, Apple launched two new elements within its iTunes Music Store: iTunes Plus and iTunes U. Analysts described the new features as an evolutionary move designed to broaden the iTunes user base. The new iTunes Plus offers DRM-free music tracks encoded in AAC at 256 Kbps for $1.29 per song. Plus launches with EMI's digital catalog, including singles and albums from Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, Norah Jones, Frank Sinatra, Joss Stone, Pink Floyd, John Coltrane, and more than a dozen of Paul McCartney's classic albums. "Our customers are very excited about the freedom and amazing sound quality of iTunes Plus," Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO, said in a statement. "We expect more than half of the songs on iTunes will be offered in iTunes Plus versions by the end of this year." With the release of iTunes Plus, customers can download tracks from EMI artists without limitations on the type of music player or number of computers on which the purchased songs can be played. The iTunes Plus songs will play on all iPods, Macs, Windows PCs, as well as many other digital music players. The iTunes store will continue to offer its entire catalog, currently over five million songs, in the same versions as today -- 128 Kbps AAC with DRM -- at 99 cents per song, alongside the higher quality iTunes Plus versions, when available. Customers can upgrade their library of previously purchased EMI content to iTunes Plus tracks for 30 cents a song, or $3.00 for most albums. EMI called the launch of the DRM-free iTunes content a significant milestone, and NPD Group analyst Russ Crupnick agreed. He predicted DRM in the digital world might eventually cease altogether for two reasons: higher price points are favorable to the industry and DRM-free content could open up new sales avenues. "DRM-free music is a way of getting more people into the practice of buying digital music. The hope is that other music stores could offer content that would get more people into the whole digital music arena," Crupnick said. "To me, that's the next important step. We've got a lot of early adopters coming in. But how do you start to mainstream digital music? This might help." Apple didn't stop there. The company also announced the launch of iTunes U, a dedicated area within the iTunes store featuring free content such as course lectures, language lessons, lab demonstrations, sports highlights, and campus tours provided by top U.S. colleges and universities including Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Duke University, and MIT. "iTunes U makes it easy for anyone to access amazing educational material from many of the country's most respected colleges and universities," Eddy Cue, Apple's vice president of iTunes, said in a statement. "Education is a lifelong pursuit and we're pleased to give everyone the ability to download lectures, speeches, and other academic content for free." with colleges and universities, iTunes U aims to make it easier to extend learning, explore interests, learn more about a school, and stay connected with an alma mater. The move demonstrates Apple's intent to make iTunes more of a community, according to Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering Group. "Apple has traditionally played a strong role in the public school system and now iTunes U goes up the ladder a little bit by offering a music interface that gives people access to content that's not always easy to get," Doherty noted. "We're entering into a phase of our economy where education is becoming more important, so this is a wonderful move for people." Increase visitor confidence on your site with the green address bar.

In fact it goes further than others and warns that even "moderate additional" greenhouse emissions are likely to push Earth past "critical tipping points" with "dangerous consequences for the planet." The study conducted by NASA and the Columbia University Earth Institute appears in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. Its lead author is James Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. The forecast effects include "increasingly rapid sea-level rise, increased frequency of droughts and floods, and increased stress on wildlife and plants due to rapidly shifting climate zones," according to the NASA announcement. By heralding the new research paper, NASA is endorsing science that places considerably more urgency on the need to reduce emissions to avoid "disastrous effects" of global warming than was evident in the recent reports from the world's scientists coordinated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. As the tipping points pass, "there is an acceleration, potentially uncontrollable, of emissions of vast natural stores of greenhouse gas," according to Hansen, who reviewed the study for ABC News. Hansen explains that dangerous feedback loops are being tracked in various regions of the planet. Many studies have reported feedback loops already observed in thawing tundra, sea beds and drying forests. Hansen also points out that dark and therefore heat-absorbing forests are now expanding toward the Arctic, replacing lighter-colored areas such as tundra and snow cover.

Cosmonauts Install Protective Space Station Panels posted: 30 May 2007 The International Space Station (ISS) is a little better protected against impact by stray particles today after two Russian cosmonauts installed debris shielding to the station during a 5 hour, 25 minute spacewalk. and flight engineer Oleg installed five Service Module Debris Protection (SMDP) panels to the service module of the orbital laboratory and also rerouted a Global Positioning System antenna cable. The spacewalk was a first for both cosmonauts. &#8220;Look at that sunset,&#8221; said one of the spacewalkers while outside the ISS. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing.&#8221; &#8220;Oh yes, I&#8217;ve already had a look,&#8221; the other one replied. Williams remained inside the space station and provided support for the spacewalkers. The number one risk Module functions as a living quarters for the ISS and is also responsible for some life support system functions for the station. It was launched in 2000 without adequate shielding against impacts by micrometeorites and orbital debris, with the intention of adding additional protection during future spacewalks. The SMDP panels are designed to protect the ISS from small- and medium-sized micro meteoroid orbital debris (MMOD) that could strike the space station and cause a potentially catastrophic hull rupture. &#8220;This is one of area we share with our shuttle brothers,&#8221; said ISS Deputy Manager Kirk before the spacewalk. &#8220;The number one risk for the shuttle is MMOD impact when it&#8217;s on orbit. It&#8217;s also that way for the ISS.&#8221; Each aluminum panel measures about two feet by three feet, is about one inch thick and weighs 15 to 20 pounds. The spacewalk kicked off at 3:05 p.m. EDT (1905 GMT), after a 45 minute delay caused by a communication problem between ground controllers and the space station encountered during preparations.

The market has already decided how much a gaming system is worth. The answer? Probably not much more than $250. Let's look at current generation console prices to date, in U.S. dollars. Nintendo's Wii rings up at about $250. Microsoft's Xbox 360's three flavors include the $300 Core pack, the $400 Premium edition, and the $480 Elite. Sony's PlayStation 3 is available in $500 and $600 options. All other things being equal, the Wii's price is obviously the most attractive, which might explain why it's outselling the 360 by about 2-to-1, and the PS3 by about 4-to-1. But all other things are not equal, of course. Not even close. Any gamer with even passing familiarity with all three systems could expound on their individual hardware strengths and weaknesses. And serious enthusiasts debate at length about the relative values of each console, and to what degree the inclusion of such features as out-of-the-box wireless should be taken into account. The prices of optional and less-optional accessories also figure into the discussion, as do the online services offered. And then there are the games. The quality and marketability of a system's game library, especially its exclusive titles, is a decisive factor in any console's success. Here again, there's plenty of room for speculation about what the future holds for each system. And not surprisingly, gamers are highly attuned to each console's ability to deliver the types of games they crave. For the dedicated gamer, there's a lot to argue, wonder and worry about. For everyone else, though, the issue boils down to one primary concern: price. It would be foolish to overlook brand strengths, marketing strategies and the like in any analysis of why the Wii is selling more units than both of its higher-end colleagues combined. I'm not suggesting that a novel control scheme and Nintendo's family-friendly image aren't helping move Wiis. And the PS3's current lack of high-profile releases is obviously hurting Sony. But these and similar factors are secondary concerns for the wider market. The bottom line is the average consumer is only going to pay so much for a gaming console, regardless of what it offers. Microsoft's and Sony's entries are simply above the price point at which the lion's share of consumers decide a gaming experience is worthwhile. Most people, regardless of their age, tax bracket or nationality, enjoy playing games from time to time, electronic or otherwise. Yet for most of the world, for which games are passing diversions, the prospect of paying hundreds of dollars for an electronic game system seems downright silly. Most gamers who venture forth into the non-gaming world are painfully aware of the fact that average consumers don't view videogames in form as worthy of copious amounts of time, money and attention. It isn't critical to them that the PS3 includes a Blu-Ray player, or the 360's Live service provides a cross-title online community, or that either features high-definition output. They're not overly concerned about the particular handful of exclusives for each console. And they're not nearly as discerning in terms of game design or quality. I'm convinced that both gamers and much of the gaming industry often vastly overestimate the considerations of the average consumer. Round up the electronic gaming experiences that have found wide audiences outside the core gamer demographic, and you'll notice a conspicuous absence of epic, immersive and original high-budget games. Instead, you'll find a steady stream of successful casual entries from PopCap and company. You'll see Nintendo's Touch! Generations titles and an accompanying army of charming, lightweight imitators. And you'll discover a deluge of half-baked cursory tie-ins to movie, television and other pop-culture IPs. The vision espoused by Sony and Microsoft, of an elite gaming lifestyle enabled by high-end, expensive tech, just doesn't appeal to the rest of the world. So it's not a matter of how much their consoles are worth. It's a matter of the degree to which modern society values electronic entertainment. If Nintendo's successes with the Wii thus far are any indication, $250 is near the upper end of what consumers are willing to pay for such experiences. So where does that leave those of us clamoring for the next , or the next-gen successors to Final Fantasy XII, Psychonauts Shadow of the Colossus ? Where does that leave the dyed-in-the wool enthusiast, accustomed to high-definition spectacle? In my less optimistic moments I'm tempted to entertain the suspicions of the populace at large, and wonder whether the near-obsessive attention we often give to games is warranted. Maybe an epic, 100-hour RPG isn't really a valuable use of my time. Does it really matter whether or not my game characters' faces show every pore or whether they perfectly lip-sych their lines? Is my hand-wringing over weapon balancing in the latest multiplayer shooter justified? And can I truly not live without destructible landscapes and motion blur? But in the end I must confess these things often matter to me. There's no denying my own unbridled enthusiasm for the high-end aspects of this medium. I take comfort in the fact I'm not alone, and that even though the high cost of the PS3 seems thus far to be a major Sony misstep, it's still selling units. And with luck it will continue to sell. Because as wrongheaded as Sony and Microsoft often appear to be in their pricing and marketing strategies, I want that slice of their vision, the one that caters to gamers such as myself, to take hold of the world at large. I want a world populated by gamers that recognize not just the value of casual, accessible diversions, but the value of visually rich, artfully designed and emotionally compelling experiences. Earlier this year Xbox platform manager John Rodman made one of those fabulously arrogant remarks we've become so accustomed to hearing from Sony and Microsoft execs. "We don't feel like the Wii customer and the Xbox customer are the same thing," he told the . "We think that as soon as the Wii customer turns 14 they want something else." As snide as Rodman's remark sounds, there's a grain of truth in what he says. And maybe even a ray of hope. It's not hard to imagine that the widespread successes of the Wii and DS will foster a greater appreciation of electronic games in general. And one has to imagine that at some point loyal DS and Wii converts might yearn for more in terms of graphical fidelity, gameplay depth, or online interaction. Right now, there's no disputing that Nintendo's winning the battle for consumers' hearts, minds and, most importantly, dollars. Will the trend continue, and will it result in an increasingly risk-averse industry, disinclined toward the production of the higher-end titles dedicated gamers seek? Will the lowest common denominator casual and licensed game offerings eventually become the face of the gaming industry? Or will consumers eventually hear the siren song of the higher-priced, higher-end consoles, amplified by growing game libraries and possible console price reductions? Time will tell, but I'm willing to bet that in the years to come, Nintendo will he heralded as having been gaming's chief evangelist, and the successes of casual and B-list games as whole will have established the foundation for an entirely new demographic of gamers. One that might even be willing to pay a lot more than $250 for a gaming console. IGG Announces Gods War Online Warhammer Online Beta Sign-Ups Open!

The arrest follows an indictment by a federal grand jury in Seattle last week. and his company, Newport Internet Marketing Corp., with fraudulently selling broadcast e-mail products and services that amounted to spam. The U.S. attorney's office for the Western District of Washington referred to Soloway as a "spam king" for the volume of unsolicited commercial e-mail his company produced. He is charged with mail fraud, identity theft, fraud and money laundering, Soloway advertised a mass e-mail service that sent messages to an opt-in list of addresses but didn't actually use such a permission-based list, the indictment said. He also sold software products that customers could use themselves to send out mass e-mails. However, the product often didn't work, and if it did, it sent e-mails using forged headers. He also failed to offer promised support services, according to the court documents. In addition, when customers complained, Soloway threatened additional fees and referral to a collection agency. Soloway is also accused of sending out tens of millions of e-mails, often using forged e-mail addresses and domains in the "from" line, advertising his services. As a result, some people who legitimately owned the e-mail address or domain were blamed for the spam and were blacklisted by Internet service providers. The indictment also said that Soloway used programs and many different proxy computers in an effort to hide the source of the messages. Soloway conducted the spamming activities at least from late 2003 through early this year, according to the indictment. If convicted, Soloway faces fines of over $772,000, which is the amount he illegally obtained from his activities, as well as forfeiture of other money and property.

With the new "Street View" feature in Google Maps, street level imagery is available for maps of the San Francisco area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver and Miami, and will soon expand to other metropolitan regions, Google said in a statement. Users looking at Google Maps through a Web browser can navigate around a city, "virtually" walking the streets, checking out restaurants and landmarks and even zoom in on bus stops or street signs to make travel plans. Google is playing catch-up with street-level viewing features, following in the footsteps of A9.com's BlockView mapping feature introduced in early 2005 and showing street-level views in roughly two dozen major U.S. cities. A9.com, a unit of Amazon.com Inc., discontinued the feature in September 2006. A9 Chief Executive Udi Manber subsequently joined Google as vice president of engineering. Microsoft Corp. has offered what it calls a "birds-eye" view on parts of its MSN Virtual Earth three-dimensional mapping service for several big U.S. cites since late in 2005. Google also announced plans for "Mapplets", a tool for independent software developers to build mini-applications that be displayed within Google Maps. Mapplets can display a variety of information, from housing listings to crime data as well as ways to measure distances between different points on the map. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo Inc. and MapQuest, a unit of Time Warner Inc.'s AOL online business, all continue to compete aggressively to create new online mapping features, said analyst Greg Sterling of Sterling Market Intelligence. &copy; Reuters 2007.

According to analyst Greg Sterling, the steady introduction of new mapping features is driven to a large extent by competition rather than by an expectation of revenue. Feds Arrest 'Spam King' in Seattle IRS Spoof Targets Execs Through RTF CDW Accepts $7.3 Billion To Go Private Palm Foleo: A 'Smartphone Companion' Samsung Debuts 4-GB Mobile Chipset According to the great British satirist Douglas Adams, the stages of a civilization can be summarized in three questions: 1. How can we eat? (Survival); 2. Why do we eat? (Inquiry); and 3. Where shall we have lunch? (Sophistication). It's the last of those questions -- the search for a good place to eat -- that is driving the most recent Web battle: the push to make online mapping services increasingly sophisticated and user-friendly. Both Google, which operates Google Maps, and , which runs Live Search Maps, announced new features on Tuesday that are designed to help users plan trips, get previews of where they are going, and, most importantly, find businesses that might be persuaded to advertise with the mapping services. Two weeks ago, Google signaled the intensity of its work in this area by launching the Google Lat Long Blog, devoted specifically to the company's work on its maps, Google Earth, its local map service, and related APIs. "Things are changing so fast," said John Hanke, the Director of Google Earth and Maps, in the blog's initial post, "we thought a blog focused on this topic would be the best way to communicate with you, both about our products and about the overall development of geo on the Web." At the Where 2.0 conference on Tuesday, Hanke rolled out two new Google developments: "Street View" and "Mapplets." The Street View feature offers map users 360 degree images of streets in various urban areas around the country. Initially, images are available for portions of the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver, and Miami, with other areas to be added later. If street level views are available for a particular area, a new button labeled "Street View" will appear on the Google map. Users can click on the image, pan in every direction, and even move forward or back, creating the illusion of walking down the street. The other feature introduced by Google, Mapplets, is designed to help developers and consumers create mini-applications that can be embedded on Google Maps to provide information or perform simple tasks. Three sample applications demonstrated by Google included real estate listings, movie times, and a distance-measurement tool. In its press release, Google said that several of its partners, including WeatherBug and Booking.com, have already created customized Mapplets. "Maps are an enormously popular application," said Greg Sterling, an Internet search analyst and founder of Sterling Market Intelligence. "They've proven to draw millions of users. In fact, Google Maps may be its most successful product, apart from search. These new features are designed to reinforce that usage."

Hate Novell because its business stinks. ) tried to clear the air last week, big time. The Waltham, Mass., software company wrapped up a review of its options accounting practices that began late last year, and announced that it won't need to restate a decade's worth of financial results. The company also provided details on a controversial pact with Microsoft )--in a nutshell, Novell hasn't agreed to sell the scaly hides of 100 open-source developers to Bill Gates in exchange for a boxcar full of gold bars. Now it's back to business as usual. Unfortunately for Novell, business isn't good. Analysts expect the company's second-quarter earnings will come in around $4.7 million on Wednesday--that's a drop of of 50%. Worse yet, sales are set to slide to $235.1 million from $278.3 million. As a result, over the past year Novell's shares have plodded along, dropping from $7.82 to $7.55. The problem? For the past 10 years, booming sales of cheap software from Microsoft and open-source software vendors have sapped sales of Novell's venerable NetWare offering. Novell tried to adapt, first by repositioning itself as a vendor of open-source software with a string of acquisitions in 2003. Then it ticked off many of its newfound friends by announcing a deal with open-source foe Microsoft last November. One of Novell's open-source developers even resigned over the arrangement. Since then, there has been widespread speculation about the deal's terms. Novell offered up many of the details when it released its annual report last week after wrapping up its accounting review. It's now clear that Novell didn't agree that Linux violates any of Microsoft's patents--a key issue for the Linux faithful. True believers aren't satisfied with the arrangement--which has Microsoft selling support from Novell for open-source software--but some concede it could have been worse. The real bad news, of course, is that Novell also made its earlier preliminary results for the first quarter official: It confirmed that it lost $19.9 million on $229.6 million in sales. The upside? Novell has more than $1.8 billion worth of cash and short-term investments. And with its accounting review wrapped up, the company can now spread a little of that money around. The company could start buying back shares or it may even reward open-source developers with a few acquisitions, analysts say. Spreading a little of its money around in the open-source community may not make it any more popular, but at least it won't be the only software company accused of selling out.

Fatdoor wants you to meet your neighbors online. Raj Abhyanker knocked on more than 3,000 doors during his 2005 bid to become a city council member in the Silicon Valley suburb of . His efforts didnât land him a seat on the council, but they did plant the seed for his newest venture. Struck by how little people seemed to know others in their neighborhood, Mr. Abhayanker soon started work on Fatdoor, a social networking service that is designed to help neighbors get to know each other. âPeople spend more time on their computer now than they do talking to their neighbors face to face,â said Mr. Abhyanker, a patent attorney whose startup launched Monday night. Co-founded by Mr. Abhyanker and Chandu Thota, the lead developer of Microsoftâs Virtual Earth mapping software, Fatdoor users can map out their addresses on top of Microsoft maps and network with the people who live nearby. Fatdoor tools allow users to send messages to their neighbors, and form hyper-local groups around certain topics. âThereâs no easy or efficient way to reach out to the neighborhood with one button, to let them know that you lost a pet or youâre having work done on your house,â said Mr. Thota. With $1 million in funding from former PayPal CEO Bill Harris and Bertram Capital managing director Jeff Drazan, Fatdoor has tapped into growing investor interest in location specific sites designed to attract local residents and advertisers. But Fatdoor is moving into an increasingly crowded market that includes zip-code-based social networking and news delivery sites such as Outside.in and Backfence. Yahoo Groups and Meetup, meanwhile, let neighbors form groups. âIf you can aggregate traffic for small local businesses, everybody is trying to tap into that,â said media analyst Greg Sterling. A key challenge for these sites is to get enough users in a given location to contribute content so the sites do not appear empty. Fatdoor, for example, is seeding its site with Yellow Pages content. The company is also trying to forge relationships with local clubs in the hopes theyâll encourage members to sign up for the service, which started its test run in Ironically, Mr. Thota hopes to drive awareness of his new site the old fashioned wayâby word of mouth. âOnce you satisfy a couple of users in the neighborhood, theyâll start evangelizing the product to neighbors,â said Mr. Thota. âItâs very event driven. When people have a block party we see more signups from that street that night.â Outside.in highlights the hyper-local. Touchscreen technology allows for group computing.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/14-1&fd=R&url=http://www.ndtvprofit.com/homepage/news.asp%3Fid%3D300758&cid=1116797290&ei=muxeRqqvDIX20AHe4M3QDQ Novell won't be punished for Microsoft deal - source BOSTON (Reuters) - A foundation that owns rights to much of the code behind Linux software has decided not to carry out threats to punish Novell Inc. over a deal with Microsoft Corp, a person familiar with the matter said. The nonprofit Free Software Foundation had threatened to take punitive action against Novell for entering into a patent agreement with Microsoft, whose Windows operating system is a rival to Linux and is seen as a foe by the open source community. Some saw the deal as endorsing Microsoft's claims that it holds patents to intellectual property behind some open source software. The foundation was reviewing whether to block Novell from getting access to the foundation-controlled components of Linux that will be distributed under the terms of a new licensing agreement that is being finalized. One of the pioneering forces behind the open source software movement, the foundation has decided not to include any language in the final draft of the agreement that will punish Novell, according to the person familiar with the foundation's deliberations. "This is good news for Novell," said Katherine Egbert, an analyst with Jefferies & Co." The foundation controls rights to a group of programs known as the GNU operating system, an important part of Linux. The group does not control the software's namesake, the Linux kernel, which is owned by another nonprofit, the Linux Foundation. Free Software Foundation Executive Director Peter Brown would not discuss the foundation's decision, but confirmed that it had finalized its proceedings. Novell and its main rival Red Hat Inc. sell standardized versions of Linux with custom features, maintenance plans and technical support. The two companies also sell other types of open source software, including OpenOffice, which competes with Microsoft Word; Excel and PowerPoint programs; and XenSource, a rival to EMC Corp.'s VMware software that boosts the efficiency of server computers. Sales of Novell's SUSE Linux products accounted for 5 percent of the $967 million in revenue that the company reported last year. The deal with Microsoft has turned into a far bigger cash generator, bringing in two upfront payments totaling $348 million. The two companies agreed to sell their products jointly, develop technologies that make it easier for businesses to use Linux alongside Windows software, and not sue each other's customers for any patent violations when using their software. Some members of the open source community said that deal would undermine the patent security of Linux software and give Microsoft an edge in persuading businesses to use Microsoft products over Linux and other types of open source software. The foundation is scheduled to disclose its decision on the Novell matter by June 4 on its Web site, www.fsf.org, when it will post the final draft of the new license, which is known as the General Public License version 3, or GPLv3. Novell Chief Financial Officer Dana Russell declined comment on the matter.

Man described as 1 of world's top 10 spammers arrested in US 1:21PM A man described as one of the world's most prolific spammers was arrested, and U.S. authorities said computer users across the Web could notice a decrease in the amount of junk e-mail. Robert Alan Soloway, 27, is accused of using networks of compromised "zombie" computers to send out millions of spam e-mails. "He's one of the top 10 spammers in the world," said Tim Cranton, a Microsoft Corp. lawyer who is senior director of the company's Worldwide Internet Safety Programs. "He's a huge problem for our customers. This is a very good day." A federal grand jury last week returned a 35-count indictment against Soloway charging him with mail fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering. Soloway pleaded not guilty Wednesday afternoon to all charges after a judge determined that _ even with four bank accounts seized by the government _ he was sufficiently well off to pay for his own lawyer. Soloway has been living in a ritzy apartment and drives an expensive Mercedes convertible, said prosecutor Kathryn Warma. Prosecutors are seeking to have him forfeit $773,000 (euro576,005) they say he made from his business, Newport Internet Marketing Corp. A public defender who represented him for Wednesday's hearing declined to comment. Prosecutors say Soloway used computers infected with malicious code to send out millions of junk e-mails since 2003. The computers are called "zombies" because owners typically have no idea their machines have been infected. He continued his activities even after Microsoft won a $7 million civil judgment against him in 2005 and the operator of a small Internet service provider in Oklahoma won a $10 million judgment, prosecutors said. U.S. Attorney Jeff Sullivan said this case is the first in the country in which federal prosecutors have used identity theft statutes to prosecute a spammer for taking over someone else's Internet domain name. Soloway could face decades in prison, though prosecutors said they have not calculated what guideline sentencing range he might face. Soloway used the networks of compromised computers to send out unsolicited bulk e-mails urging people to use his Internet marketing company to advertise their products, authorities said. People who clicked on a link in the e-mail were directed to his website. There, Soloway advertised his ability to send out as many as 20 million e-mail advertisements over 15 days for $495 (euro368), the indictment said. Soloway remained in federal detention pending a hearing Monday. This story is sourced direct from an overseas news agency as an additional service to readers.

Fatdoor: Social Networking for Real Communities Fatdoor social network mirrors the real world to let users connect with neighbors and local businesses. Part 1 of a special five-part series. Thursday, AM PDT Fatdoor.com, a Web site that mirrors the real world to let users to connect with their neighbors, launched Tuesday with a new spin on social networking. Instead of anonymous interaction, Fatdoor lets users communicate directly with local neighbors and businesses, said Raj Abhyanker, CEO and co-founder of the company. Abhyanker launched the company with Chandu Thota, who was the lead developer for Microsoft Corp.'s Virtual Earth mapping and location tool. Bill Harris, the former CEO of PayPal Inc. and Intuit Inc., is an investor and chairman of the company. "We're trying to build something on the Internet that mirrors the real world," Harris said. "We call it a local community network. It is a social network that is based around the place you live and the ... people you know. It is not an anonymous activity; this is a social network for adults." Abhyanker said he came up with the idea while running for the city council of Cupertino, Calif., in 2005. After knocking on 3,000 doors as part of his canvassing, he noticed that most people didn't know their neighbors. He said he began thinking about how to use the Web to "enhance neighborhoods, to give the power to the few who are very active to use for the common benefit of all neighbors." The first release of Fatdoor is open to residents of Silicon Valley, with later releases expanding the site cities and towns throughout the U.S. The site was built using Virtual Earth maps, showing specific house and businesses as icons. The icons can be "claimed" by users to hold their online profiles, which can be viewed by others in the neighborhood looking for specific services, to start a club or for other purposes, Abhyanker said. As users add content, their neighbors can learn about local events or business deals, he added. The goal is to foster a group of active users in the neighborhood who can self-regulate content using the Wikipedia model. Eventually, Abhyanker said, Fatdoor could be used by community activists or civic groups for various projects, such as producing a neighborhood newspaper, he added. Harris said the business model for Fatdoor calls for the site to eventually be supported by national and local advertisers eager to target users in specific locations. The site will first list all businesses in the local Yellow Pages and then allow each of those companies to personalize the listings, he said. Users can then add reviews and comments about the businesses. For more enterprise computing news, visit . Story copyright &copy; 2007 Computerworld Inc.

Panoramio has worked hand in hand with Google for a long time, but, on Wednesday evening, the relationship became more of a hand within hand sort of thing as Google acquired the company. Panoramio &ldquo;is a website that enables digital photographers to geolocate, store and organize their photographs - and to view those photographs in Google Earth and Google Maps,&rdquo; as explained by a statement from Google. The acquisition won&rsquo;t change any of that; Panoramio will continue to be a default layer in Yet, presumably because of the privacy concerns that pop up whenever Google is involved, users are being provided with the opportunity to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of the acquisition. Users who don&rsquo;t choose this option - or who do nothing at all - will, at the close of the deal, have their Panoramio-related data and photos transferred to the search engine giant. The acquisition will, however, &ldquo;bring many advantages to Panoramio users, starting with a better infrastructure to improve the reliability of Panoramio, more frequent updates of Panoramio&rsquo;s Google Earth layer, and more resources for some invisible tasks that take time out from working on new features,&rdquo; according to &ldquo;Jos&eacute;, Joaqu&iacute;n and Eduardo&rdquo; - Panoramio&rsquo;s three . (Joaqu&iacute;n and Eduardo are actually co-founders.) One last note - even as the $75 million deal between eBay and StumbleUpon is confirmed, we&rsquo;ve been left in the dark about the financial details of the Google-Panoramio acquisition. The terms were not disclosed, but, according to , the company was &ldquo;very (and we mean very) happy&rdquo; about the takeover. Doug is a staff writer for for the latest eBusiness news.

Special Coverage, Palm Foleo Q & A Video Conversation with Jeff Hawkins and before my (sadly brief) hands-on with the Foleo , I was lucky enough to get to sit down for a chat with Jeff Hawkins along with Ryan Kairer of PalmInfocenter and a fellow from cnet. I had my video camera along and was all set to tape the whole thing. Hawkins, though, was understandably tired of having his game face on and said something to the tune of "Sure, you can video tape this and I guess I'll be a little more careful about it. Or not." The choice between getting a video of the inventor of the Treo and hearing his unfiltered thoughts on the Foleo and smartphones at large "ain't no choice at all." So I turned off the camera while Jeff turned up his excitement about Foleo. Here are TreoCentral's notes and thoughts on our conversation It's the best idea I've ever had If I learned nothing else from my trip to get a chance to see the Foleo in the "flesh" it's this: Jeff Hawkins either is genuinely excited about the Foleo or he's an incredibly good actor. He started our conversation by talking about a theme that's familiar to anyone who's been following the story of the Foleo: First the Palm Pilot created a new category, then the Treo did, now it's happening again with the Foleo. "We've made three 'category defining products.' This is the biggest one of all," said Hawkins. Given the relative skepticism with which the Foleo has been received, this is a very bold statement. Yet Hawkins is unabashed in his enthusiasm for the product. "A lot of people thought the Pilot was a stupid idea." Hawkins then went on an extended riff on the origins of the Palm Pilot. What Palm really intended to do was make a pocket computer, but of course in terms of cost and the then available chips, the technology wasn't ready for it yet. What it was, though, was a step in the direction they wanted to move. It was a way to get their foot in the door in the minds of consumers and into the market as well. Here was the lesson of the Pilot: "With any new product, you have to find somebody who wants to buy it." With the Pilot, that person was somebody looking to replace a bulky binder-style organizer. What Palm aimed for was the creation of a new category rather than try to just "shrink a computer." That's why Hawkins doesn't believe the UMPC is successful now and why it may never be - there's not a large enough group of 'initial customers.' The lessons of the Pilot heavily influenced Palm's choices when making the Foleo. The decision to focus on just a few core applications at launch (email, browsing, office, and phone sync) is a result of that decision. "It's really a two stage process." the target market for the Foleo? In a word, . Hawkins said he has received a lot a positive responses from executives at the conference. "They said, 'This is exactly what I've been wanting.'" While it's not surprising that Hawkins would describe positive responses to the Foleo in the midst of its announcement, the focus on executives is telling. Hawkins understands that the Foleo as it currently exists isn't necessarily the super-device we were looking for. But just as the Pilot started as 'just and organizer' and the VisorPhone started 'just as a phone slapped on a PDA,' (my quote, not his), the Foleo seems to be only as 'just a mobile companion.' Just before interviewing Hawkins, I hurriedly asked a bunch of folks to send me one question I should ask. Michael Ducker sent me one that had been sitting in the back of my mind all day - "Is it really a stealth product like the VisorPhone was?" Something Hawkins had said earlier in the day : clicked with me: He said he expects initial sales numbers to be small: "It's not going to be a driver in the short term. But it allows us to rethink how you design smartphones." So - "How does this allow you to do that, to rethink smartphones?" Not too surprisingly, this question really got Hawkins excited. "I can't really go into it [too much]." Hawkins then discussed a theme we've heard often from Palm Execs - the difficult tradeoffs in making a smartphone. A smartphone has a screen that's as large as possible, has a battery that will last throughout a full day of use, has a keyboard that's easy to type on, a processor, memory, etc. All these features have to be balanced very carefully - they limit the ways in which a smartphone can be designed. Suddenly, for Hawkins, having the Foleo allows him to make a sort of end-run around some of these issues (like the screen and keyboard, the two most-cited features of the Foleo). "I can think about these problems differently. It gives me a different palette I can use to think about apps. [...] It moves the burden of email [for example, to the Foleo], frees up the balance of functionality." Hawkins then returned to a theme that he's mentioned in the earlier he'd given about the Foleo. Imagine if you had "a ton of storage, a ton, basically unlimited storage" on your smartphone. Add that to the fact that you're no longer as constrained by all of those "tradeoffs" that usually apply to the smartphone's design. "I have to just give you a tease here. But that's the direction we're thinking." Hawkins would say no more. The key, I think, is two-fold. One: the Foleo, as it's currently being marketed (perhaps even as it's currently being made) hasn't achieved what Hawkins has planned for it yet. Two: Neither is the smartphone. 1. Quotes are as accurate as I can make them based on my scribbles, fyi.

Sign up to receive Security Resource Alerts that mirrors the real world to let users to connect with their neighbors, launched Tuesday with a new spin on social networking. Instead of anonymous interaction, Fatdoor lets users communicate directly with local neighbors and businesses, said Raj Abhyanker, CEO and co-founder of the company. Abhyanker launched the company with Chandu Thota, who was the lead developer for 's Virtual Earth mapping and location tool. Bill Harris, the former CEO of PayPal Inc. and , is an investor and chairman of the company. "We're trying to build something on the Internet that mirrors the real world," Harris said. "We call it a local community network. It is a social network that is based around the place you live and the ... people you know. It is not an anonymous activity; this is a social network for adults." Abhyanker said he came up with the idea while running for the city council of Cupertino, Calif., in 2005. After knocking on 3,000 doors as part of his canvassing, he noticed that most people didn't know their neighbors. He said he began thinking about how to use the Web to "enhance neighborhoods, to give the power to the few who are very active to use for the common benefit of all neighbors." The first release of Fatdoor is open to residents of Silicon Valley, with later releases expanding the site cities and towns throughout the U.S. The site was built using Virtual Earth maps, showing specific house and businesses as icons. The icons can be "claimed" by users to hold their online profiles, which can be viewed by others in the neighborhood looking for specific services, to start a club or for other purposes, Abhyanker said. As users add content, their neighbors can learn about local events or business deals, he added. The goal is to foster a group of active users in the neighborhood who can self-regulate content using the model. Eventually, Abhyanker said, Fatdoor could be used by community activists or civic groups for various projects, such as producing a neighborhood newspaper, he added. Harris said the business model for Fatdoor calls for the site to eventually be supported by national and local advertisers eager to target users in specific locations. The site will first list all businesses in the local Yellow Pages and then allow each of those companies to personalize the listings, he said. Users can then add reviews and comments about the businesses.

With this, the veil has been lifted in part from this controversial patent partnership. With this unveiling we now know that there is still no proof, other than Microsoft's flat unsupported statement, that Linux violates any of Microsoft's patents. We also know that it appears, as Novell CEO Ron Hovsepian has said, that Novell never agreed that Linux violated Microsoft's patents. In the agreement, as no less a figure than Richard M. Stallman, the author of the GPL, said not long after the Novell/Microsoft patent deal became public news, "Microsoft has not given Novell a patent license, and thus, section 7 of GPL version 2 does not come into play. Instead, Microsoft offered a patent license that is rather limited to Novell's customers alone." Stallman also said: "It turns out that perhaps it's a good thing that Microsoft did this now, because we discovered that the text we had written for GPL version 3 would not have blocked this, but it's not too late and we're going to make sure that when GPL version 3 really comes out it will block such deals. We were already concerned about possibilities like this, namely, the possibility that a distributor might receive a patent license which did not explicitly impose limits on downstream recipients but simply failed to protect them." The vast majority of people who were concerned with this matter agreed with Stallman. They saw the GPLv3 as blocking any future such partnerships between Microsoft, or other proprietary software companies, and open-source software businesses. The attorneys of the SFLC (Software Freedom Law Center) would come to see the interaction of the GPLv3 and the Novell/Microsoft patent deal in quite a different light. Richard Fontana, counsel for the SFLC, revealed this new view when he said, "Now that Microsoft has effectively become a distributor of Linux, by distributing some 50,000 or so Novell SLES coupons, it has perhaps unwittingly restricted its ability to sue Linux users over its patents. While this is particularly clear under the forthcoming Version 3 of the GPL, the Microsoft lawyers who helped craft the MS-Novell deal appear to have overlooked the fact that, by procuring the distribution of lots of free software under GPL Version 2, among other licenses, Microsoft has already lost some of its power to assert patents against subsequent distributors and users of that software."

ThinkFree brings social networking to documents Digg revolt highlights shortcomings of Web 2.0 view Firefox goes social with The Coop Adobes Apollo to revolutionize web apps? Telcos could miss out on mobile Web 2.0 opportunities Fatdoor brings together familiar social networking elements such as personal profiles, intra-personal connections, group networking and information sharing. It uses the Microsoft Virtual Earth online mapping platform to enable users to identify their area of interest and the location of other users. The company says an alpha site is initially available ( ) as an invitation-only trial and will be rolled-out in additional cities throughout the US over the coming months. It promises to kick off with rich maps and pre-populated data for more than 100 million households in the US. People will be able to "get to know their neighbours by exploring local profiles and interests, and discover new friends in the neighbourhood." Using the Fatdoor mail service, they will be able to contact their neighbours "in a non-invasive, non-threatening way." The Palo Alto based company is led by a number of technology industry veterans. Co-founder and CEO is Raj Abhyanker, a patent attorney, electrical engineer and former CEO of numerous Internet startups in the mid 1990s. These included AOL Classifieds.com (sold to AOL), MacInsider, Clay Pixel Studios, and Raj Abhyanker LLP (a patent law firm). Co-founder and CTO Chandu Thota previously worked at Microsoft where he was a central figure in building the Microsoft Virtual Earth online mapping platform and Live Search Maps. He has recently authored "Programming MapPoint" and "Virtual Earth in .Net" by O&#39;Reilly publishing. He is listed as an inventor on more than 14 patent applications for Microsoft related to geo-spatial mapping and technology. Jan Jannink, the Community Architect of Fatdoor, was a founder of imeem, a popular social network with more than one million members. He invented the database architecture and the data model for imeem. Chairman Bill Harris was formerly CEO of Intuit and PayPal. Fatdoor also has technology relationships with Amazon.com, Google Inc., and Yahoo! but has not revealed details of these.

IT and TELCO JOBS Has Jobs backed the wrong horse with Apple TV's YouTube access? Has Jobs backed the wrong horse with Apple TV's YouTube access? Thursday, 31 May 2007 The hamstrung Apple TV media player is finally showing signs of life, with Apple adding YouTube access and a 160GB hard drive, but getting into bed with GooTube might backfire on Steve Jobs. YouTube goes AppleTube as Apple TV gets upgrade More iPhone clues and rumours YouTube on your Apple TV Ol' Blue Eyes is back at iTunes Plus Its official: DRM-free music now on sale at iTunes Plus It was an obvious move from Apple in terms of what users want, I said back in February that a You Tube-compatible flash video player in the Apple TV could be enough to win over a massive slice on the non-tech savvy market . Instead YouTube is switching it&#39;s video format to Apple TV-friendly H.264. Still, I thought YouTube&#39;s legal wranglings might have scared Apple away. It won&#39;t be long before the copyright police try to drag Apple into one of the YouTube lawsuits, but if they were to take on Google and Apple they might find they&#39;ve bitten off more than they can chew. The bigger worry for Jobs is creating bad blood with the major content providers currently at war with YouTube, such as Viacom. Striking content deals for the various iTunes stores around the world (like Australia&#39;s sub-standard offering) could become even tricker if content providers see Apple in bed with the enemy. The iTunes store finally faces some serious competition for eyeballs in the form of services such as Joost, although the Apple TV has proven so easy to hack that people are already running Joost on it. Just like the iPod, the Apple TV is merely a vehicle for selling stuff at the iTunes store. Thanks to iTunes&#39; domination of the online content market, Jobs thinks he can dictate terms to the content providers. So far he&#39;s pulled it off, such as with the introduction DRM-free music, but will his luck hold out? Getting into bed with YouTube could be going too far.

Bill Gates yesterday took his vision for personal computers to a higher plane, where the mouse and keyboard are replaced by more natural interaction using voice, pen and touch. The co-founder of Microsoft unveiled a coffee-table-shaped "surface computer" which has a 30-inch display under a hard-plastic tabletop, allowing people to touch and move objects on screen for everything from digital finger painting and jigsaw puzzles to ordering off a virtual menu in a restaurant. The Surface computer also recognises and responds to special bar codes attached to everyday objects placed on its top, so cell-phone users can easily buy ringtones or change payment plans by placing their handsets on in-store displays, or a group of people gathered round the table can check out the photos on a digital camera placed on top. So-called "multi-touch" interfaces, which allow the user to gesture with several fingers at once to manipulate data, rather than relying on a mouse and menus, have been making waves in technological circles for some considerable time. One of the most eagerly-awaited examples is Apple's iPhone, scheduled to be released next month. It combines a mobile phone, a widescreen iPod with touch controls and an internet communications device with e-mail, web browsing, maps and searching in a small handheld device. It lets the user control everything with their fingers. Hewlett-Packard has also been looking at expanding multi-touch technology. So, too, have leading research scientists such as Jeff Han of New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, said it would manufacture the Surface com-puter itself and sell it initially to corporate customers, deploying the first units in November in Sheraton hotels, Harrah's casinos, T-Mobile stores and restaurants. The company is selling the Surface, essentially a Windows Vista PC tucked inside a shiny black table base, for between &#163;2500 and &#163;5000 each but aims to bring prices down to consumer levels in three to five years. Steve Ballmer, chief executive, said: "We see this as a multi-billion dollar category, and we envision a time when Surface computing technologies will be pervasive, from tabletops and counters to the hallway mirror." Analysts said the first few applications only hinted at what was possible. Matt Rosoff, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft, an independent research firm, said: "The potential for the interface is huge. Once you open it up to applications, what you can think of is limitless." Microsofts Surface could spell the demise of the mouse Chris Webb, spokesman for the British Computer Society, described it as "an exciting and revolutionary time". The society is celebrating its 50th anniversary and to give an idea of how far it had come, he said: "In 1957, one mainframe for a computer would be equivalent to one mobile phone today. "The fast pace of change is so dramatic that what one forecast would happen in 10 years' time will take place in five." Mr Webb predicted the mouse would be defunct in five years - which could mean two and a half. Microsoft held demonstrations of the technology last week and Mr Ballmer officially introduced it yesterday at Wall Street Journal's D: All Things Digital conference. Microsoft shunned its usual PC manufacturing partners and decided to take control of the Surface computer's hardware production using an undisclosed contract manufacturer. The company has a mixed record with new technology. Its Zune music player has not yet become a major challenger to Apple's iPod but its Xbox 360 game console has enjoyed early success in the battle of next-generation game machines. For years, Gates has championed touch-screen technology such as the tablet PC with little success but the Surface is a totally different shape and allows for multiple users. People really like it because it mimics what they do in the real world' Pete Thompson, Microsoft Surface general manager In a demonstration, Microsoft placed a digital camera with a wireless chip on the tabletop. The Surface recognised the camera and sent its pictures to the display, allowing people around the table to sift through them, grabbing and turning pictures or making them bigger or smaller by spreading or narrowing their fingers. Microsoft showed in another demonstration how Deutsche Telekom cell-phone operator T-Mobile USA, one of its launch partners, could deploy the computer in its stores. A customer can take a phone off the shelf, place it on the tabletop where it will recognise the device and pop up the handset's specifications and information to the screen. For a side-by-side comparison with another phone, the customer can put down a second handset next to the first phone. "It's drop-dead simple and people really like it, because it mimics what they do in the real world," said Pete Thompson, general manager of Microsoft's Surface computing business. Microsoft said at the launch it would deploy a virtual concierge for Harrah's Entertainment's casinos in Las Vegas and place the Surface computers in the lobbies of Starwood Hotel & Resorts Worldwide Sheraton hotels. Guests sitting in some Starwood Hotel lobbies will be able to cluster around the Surface to play music, then buy songs using a credit card or rewards card tagged with a bar code. In some hotel restaurants, customers will be able to order food and drinks, then split the bill by setting down a card or a room key and dragging their menu items "on to" the card. Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Jupiter Research, said Surface was "important for Microsoft as a promising new business, as well as demonstrating very concretely to the market Microsoft still knows how to innovate, and innovate in a big way". Tidal wave of technology began with simple charts The first computers were people. "Computer" was originally a job title: it was used to describe those human beings (predominantly women) whose job it was to perform the repetitive calculations required to compute such things as navigational tables and tide charts. One of the earliest attempts to build an all-electronic digital computer occurred in 1937 by JV Atanasoff, a professor of physics and mathematics at Iowa State University. Another candidate for granddaddy of the modern computer was Colossus, built during the Second World War by Britain to try to break the cryptographic codes used by Germany. Computers had been around for 20 years before the first microprocessor was developed at Intel in 1971. Bill Gates dropped out of college so he could concentrate on writing programs. In 1975 Paul Allen and Bill Gates developed BASIC for the Altair 8800 and Microsoft was born. Microcomputers first appeared in the 1970s. Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Computer, is credited with developing the first mass-market home computers. The Apple Macintosh made its debut in 1984. It featured a simple, graphical interface, used the 8-MHz, 32-bit Motorola 68000 CPU, and had a built-in 9in black-and-white screen. Microsoft's Windows 1.0 shipped in November 1985. By 1989, the company's sales had reached $1bn. &copy; All rights reserved.

Palm has hailed Foleo, which is slated for launch by the end of the summer, as a new category of mobile computing, what it calls "mobile companion," but many pundits say Foleo is little more than an inexpensive ultra-mobile PC. Except Foleo is a little heavy to be an ultra-mobile, tipping the scales at 2.5 pounds. It boasts a 10-inch display and as much as five hour&#0039;s battery life. Foleo automatically syncs with a user&#0039;s Treo, via Bluetooth, and is expected to also work with competing products at some future point, said Palm director of product marketing for Foleo Paul Cousineau. That would include RIM&#0039;s BlackBerry and the forthcoming iPhone from Apple. With a $500 price tag, the device is less expensive than most ultra-mobile PCs, which are handheld PCs that have all the functionality of a desktop. But Cousineau said Foleo doesn&#0039;t pretend to be an ultra-mobile because it does not add functionality to the Treo other than ease of use. The benefit to users is chiefly its large keyboard and display, Cousineau said. He said Palm intentionally chose a narrow set of applications to work on Foleo in order to help keep its power consumption low. "You will not find one [ultra-mobile PC] in any normal configuration that will give you a full five hours of use," Cousineau said. "This product is very much more like an appliance in terms of the complexity and ease of use of the product and the narrowness of functionality." Palm has kept Foleo&#0039;s power consumption down by doing away with a hard drive and instead making it a solid-state device. And it has a mobile microprocessor that is more similar to smartphone silicon than a notebook CPU. Foleo has what&#0039;s known as instant-on capability, which means it turns on and off with a single button, like any PDA. There is no hibernation mode. It also has one-button access to email and all the other types of functionality of the smartphone, Cousineau said. And because Foleo also has WiFi, it essentially turns the Treo into a dual-mode device. Palm is touting Foleo as the first in a line of new mobile products, which Cousineau said likely will include new devices to target both vertical and horizontal applications. "I think there&#0039;s a lot of opportunity for the product to go in a number of ways," he said. More media capabilities may be added as mobile microprocessing power increases. Windows Mobile capabilities are also on the horizon, he said, whether they are developed by Palm or third parties. Foleo may become a little thinner in the short to medium-term time frame, Cousineau said. "It&#0039;s really as small as it can get with a full-size keyboard," he said. Many pundits are panning the Foleo as little more than a screen and keyboard for the Treo and, at some future point, other smartphones. Turns out, this is precisely Palm&#0039;s intention with Foleo. But the company&#0039;s over-hyped marketing has left Treo followers feeling deflated. Indeed, a new category of mobile computing the Foleo is not. Still, Foleo deserves a little more credit than it&#0039;s getting in most of online reviews. Don&#0039;t underestimate the value of a full-size keyboard and relatively large screen to mobile workers, particularly those of Baby Boomer age. For anyone over 40, typing a meaningful email with your thumbs into a tiny screen is tricky for any extended period of time. Tricky enough for you to turn to your laptop as soon as possible. Not having to pack your relatively large laptop on your next road trip may well justify Foleo&#0039;s $500 price tag.

Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Article Launched: 05/30/2007 11:14:18 PM PDT CARLSBAD - The words that come to mind when trying to describe tech titans Bill Gates and Steve Jobs don't usually include "nostalgic," "sentimental" or "soft." Yet in a historic joint appearance at the D: All Things Digital Conference on Wednesday, the two were at times overcome about their history together. Indeed, by the end, both men seemed choked up by the emotion of the moment. Gates in particular took special pride in his role as co-founder and chairman of Microsoft. Even after being praised for his recent philanthropic efforts, Gates talked more about what he did in the technology industry than what his charitable foundation is doing now. "The most important work I got a chance to be involved in - no matter what I do - is the personal computer," Gates said. "That's my life's work." It's been quite a life for the two of them, and they have been at the center of the action for most of their careers. Jobs, co-founder and chief executive of Apple, noted that when they started working together in the mid-1970s, he and Gates were often the youngest people in the room. Now, he said, he's often the oldest. Paraphrasing a Beatles song, he added, "You and I have memories that are longer than the road that stretches out ahead." To be sure, the appearance wasn't a love fest. Jobs at times, as he's wont to do, seemed to get under Gates' skin. At one point he tried to convince Gates that Apple isn't trying to be mean by poking fun at the "PC guy," the lovable loser who stands in sharp contrast to Apple's cool "Mac guy" in a popular series of commercials. "The art of those commercials ... is for those guys to like each other," Jobs said. "The PC guy is what makes it all work, actually. It's worth thinking about." Needless to say, Gates didn't appear to be convinced. In an interview with Newsweek earlier this year, he'd even questioned the ads' veracity. Still, the two did show their mutual respect for each other. Gates, for instance, praised Jobs' aesthetic sense, noting that it sharply differed from his own sensibility, which is to approach problems from an engineering perspective. "I'd give a lot to have Steve's taste - in terms of intuitive taste for people and products," he said. "The way he does things, it's just different. It's magical." Similarly, Jobs said that Apple could have learned a lot from Microsoft's penchant for partnering with other companies in the industry. Partnering simply wasn't in Apple's DNA, and the company didn't learn how to do it until decades after its founding, he said. "The funny thing is Microsoft's one of the few companies we were able to partner with (where) that actually worked for both companies," he said. The conversation was moderated by longtime technology journalists Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg, who organized the event, and took place in front of such luminaries as /movie director George Lucas, domestic diva Martha Stewart and former AOL Chairman Steve Case. The event marked the first time Jobs and Gates have made a joint public appearance since the 1997 Boston Macworld event, when Gates joined Jobs via teleconference to announce a landmark deal between their two companies. The previous time the two appeared together at a public event was in the early 1980s. Jobs' participation in the event capped a long day for him and the company. Earlier in the day, the iconic CEO participated in a separate conversation with Mossberg. During that event, he announced that the company's Apple TV set-top box would soon allow users to watch YouTube videos from the Internet. Meanwhile, Apple announced early Wednesday morning that it has added unprotected digital songs from music label EMI to its iTunes music store as part of an agreement the companies announced in April. The company also announced that it was adding course lectures and other education materials for download from the iTunes store. The two tech titans have long been known for their rivalry. What isn't as well understood is that they and their companies also have a history of cooperation. Microsoft has been one of the most important software developers for the Macintosh, and the company arguably helped save Apple in 1997 with a &#36;150 million investment and a commitment to continue developing its Office suite for the Mac. On a personal level, Jobs and Gates were good enough friends in the 1980s to double date occasionally and for Gates to leave friendly prank calls on Jobs' answering machine. That said, Jobs is well known for taking pot-shots at his company's bigger rival. And he didn't disappoint on Wednesday. The company's iTunes software is one of the most popular programs on computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system, Jobs noted in his conversation earlier in the day with Mossberg. Indeed, he said, some users have written to tell Apple that it's their favorite Windows application, he said. "It's like giving a glass of ice water to somebody in hell," he said.

(file image) Washington DC (SPX) May 30, 2007 Michael Griffin NASA Administrator has told America's National Public Radio that while he has no doubt a trend of global warming exists "I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with." In an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep that will air in Thursday's edition of NPR News' Morning Edition, Administrator Griffin explains: "I guess I would ask which human beings - where and when - are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take." The comments come at a difficult time for the Bush Administration which is under growing pressure from other members of the G8 club which under the current Chair of Germany is pushing for global action on Co2 emissions. NASA scientists have also been in the spotlight in recent years for research papers and public statements that did not sit well with the Bush White House. After several highly public disagreements over the right of NASA scientists to speak their mind a stalemate was reached. But in recent weeks a new squabble over NASA has broken out in Washington with the new Democrat dominated Congress passing an increasingly critical eye over NASA and it's operations, where budget pressures are building against a backdrop of competing programs, centers and agendas. The transcribed excerpts were released by NPR on May 30 as a teaser to what will prove to be a an interview of much note in the next few days. One thing that's been mentioned that NASA is perhaps not spending as much money as it could on is studying climate change, global warming, from space. Are you concerned about global warming? I am aware that global warming -- I'm aware that global warming exists. I understand that the bulk of scientific evidence accumulated supports the claim that we've had about a one degree centigrade rise in temperature over the last century to within an accuracy of 20 percent. I'm also aware of recent findings that appear to have nailed down -- pretty well nailed down the conclusion that much of that is manmade. Whether that is a long term concern or not, I can't say. And I just wanted to make sure that I'm clear. Do you have any doubt that this is a problem that mankind has to wrestle with? I have no doubt that global -- that a trend of global warming exists. I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with. To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn't change. First of all, I don't think it's within the power of human beings to assure that the climate does not change, as millions of years of history have shown, and second of all, I guess I would ask which human beings - where and when - are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take. Is that thinking that informs you as you put together the budget? That something is happening, that it's worth studying, but you're not sure that you want to be battling it as an army might battle an enemy. Nowhere in NASA's authorization, which of course governs what we do, is there anything at all telling us that we should take actions to affect climate change in either one way or another. We study global climate change, that is in our authorization, we think we do it rather well. I'm proud of that, but NASA is not an agency chartered to quote "battle climate change."

Russian Academy of Sciences Academic Yury Izrael told a news conference that the method envisions air spraying of a sulfur-containing aerosol in lower stratosphere layers at a height of 10-14 kilometers (six to 10 miles). Sulfur drops would then reflect solar radiation.

The new street-racing adventure is called ProStreet, and is heading to Xbox 360, PS3, PC, Wii, DS, PS2, PSP and mobile this autumn. EA Black Box in Canada will be creating it, and it's back to the underbelly of the racing world we go, rubbing shoulders with Vin Diesel types at every turn. The graphics have undergone an overhaul and look suitably jaw-dropping, and the A.I. will also be much more aggressive and realistic this time around. But the biggest changes come in the form of the "Autosculpt" technology, which will let you customise not only the appearance of your car, but also its performance. Plus every crash and bump you pick up will leave noticeable, lasting dents and scratches on your beautiful bodywork. There's also what's being dubbed as, "a revolutionary online mode that will redefine the meaning of competitive social play". It's one step closer to the deep-immersion goal EA covets, and it will probably sell by the absolute truck-load as usual. "Need for Speed ProStreet accelerates street racing culture by providing the ultimate stage for the pursuit of supremacy," said Larry LaPierre, executive producer of the game. "This is a game about building the ultimate performance-tuned battle machine, taking it to multi-disciplinary showdowns all over the world and pitting your skills and reputation against the very best street racers."

Today marks the launch of the much rumoured, much hyped 'Palm Foleo' and for the life of me I can't work out why it exists. Apparently the first 'smartphone companion' it offers a slim and light laptop form factor (10in LCD, keyboard, Bluetooth, WiFi, 1.13Kg) but without anything like the same functionality. Instead the Foleo exists primarily to synch with your smartphone (initially a Palm, but Windows Mobile, RiM and Symbian devices in time), enabling users to open their device's emails and attachments or surf the web on a larger screen using more fully featured clients. Battery life is good for five hours of use and its Linux OS means it can be used on its own as a kind of stripped down laptop. Ok fine, but I have two major issues here: 1. Isn't the entire point of a smartphone so that you need to carry a laptop sized device around with you? going to carry a laptop sized device around with you why not carry Yes, the Foleo is cheaper than most slim line laptops at $599 ($499 for a limited time with a $100 in box rebate) but do you really want to own a smartphone, a laptop sized device to synchronise with your smartphone and a laptop to synchronise with your smartphone? Aren't our lives complicated enough?! Personally, I can't think of anything worse than adding yet another device into our lives that requires synchronisation. One laptop, one smartphone, one PC is quite enough thank you and I think most people would agree with me... Of course I may be completely wrong. Palm founder Jeff Hawkins describes it as "the most exciting product I have ever worked on" but surely  if popular (which it won't be) - it represents a massive backwards step for an industry which has spent the last few years trying to untie us from our laptops. And besides, I'm never wrong. Palm Launches Treo 750v Palm Announces Budget Treo &copy; 2003-2007 TrustedReviews.com Ltd. |

The table-shaped computer  initially targeting commercial establishments  does away with the mouse and keyboard in favour of a large 30in multi-touch screen. Much like Apple's iPhone, this interface allows multiple gestures to be performed on the screen simultaneously, think: two businessmen analysing documents or  if you're cooler  picture Minority Report (only on a table). Little else was given away about the horsepower behind Surface, but we do know it will run on Windows Vista and sport 10/100 Ethernet, wireless b/g and Bluetooth 2.0 connectivity. As for the form factor (read: table) itself this is 22 inches high, 21 inches deep and 42 inches wide with an acrylic tabletop and power coated steel interior frame. Microsoft aims to put the Surface in hotels, restaurants, retail establishments and public entertainment venues before the end of the year and projects costs between $5,000 and $10,000 (£2,525 and £5,050) depending on configuration. First partnerships are with Harrah's Entertainment whose properties include Caesars Palace and the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide and T-Mobile USA. Microsoft said it aims to put cheaper versions of Surface in homes within three to five years. This sounds great in theory though I hope during this time the company considers other shapes (the mirror, perhaps?) for the good of our spinal cords...

(MSFT.O) is making the biggest splash with three games this week. Which phone company plans to use Microsoft's new Surface computer? Test Your Knowledge -- More Questions Resources for anyone who runs a small business or wants to start one. Small Business on the Net Save & Share Article The software giant's Xbox 360 console gets the long-awaited racing simulator "Forza Motorsport 2," as well as "Shadowrun," a shooter that mixes swords and sorcery with modern firepower such as rocket launchers and sniper rifles. PC purists who sniff at the idea of playing a shooter on a console will finally get their hands on a Windows version of "Halo 2," Microsoft's blockbuster sci-fi title for the original Xbox that came out nearly three years ago. "Shadowrun" is also for sale in a PC version, and Microsoft is bridging the gap between PCs and consoles by letting players of the different versions combat each other over the company's Live online service. "Forza 2," which was delayed from its original release date in late 2005, puts players behind the wheels of more than 300 super-realistic cars. Players can customize the performance and appearance of their rides and share them online. Dan Greenawalt, game director for "Forza 2," said the game should do well despite hitting the market at the start of what is the industry's slowest season. "We slipped (the release of) this game out and the reason is that you don't ship a date, you ship a game. It just wasn't the game we wanted to make," Greenawalt said. "I can't speak to the broader portfolio, but I think it's a great game at suboptimal time." 's (7974.OS) Wii console have complained about a dearth of new titles, and they get a respite with "Mario Party 8," a collection of multiplayer mini games that make use of the machine's motion-sensitive controller. "One game that will be a bigger hit than expected will be 'Mario Party 8', not because it's a particularly good game but because everything for the Wii is doing well right now," said Dan Hsu, editor-in-chief of gaming magazine EGM. In mid-June, Nintendo will also offer "Big Brain Academy: Wii Degree," a console version of its popular mind exercise series for its DS handheld. "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas," the popular tactical shooter from French publisher Ubisoft (UBIP.PA), storms onto 's (6758.T) PlayStation 3 in mid-June. But PS3 fans won't get an exclusive title until the end of July with the debut of "Lair," a gorgeous fantasy game in which players control flying, fire-breathing dragons. While not expected to drive sales of the PS3, "Lair" is an important addition to Sony's stable of games until it rolls out more A-list titles for the holidays. "The PlayStation 3 seems to have a lack of killer apps ... but games like 'Lair' are more like Sony saying we're building a solid library," Hsu said. "You don't want to be defined by just one game." In terms of overall sales, the PS3 is straggling behind the Xbox 360 and the surging Wii, but Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo are all saving their best games for the end of the year, when the industry racks up half of its annual sales. "Market share is not going to be decided this summer, it will happen this holiday season," said Evan Wilson, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. "It's summertime, there are not a lot of hardware sales, and people are outside and not inside playing games." AP CEO Urges Media to Adapt to the Web Burglar Steals West Va.

Cisco's Chambers pushes video, Web 2.0 New and improved version of Gozi Trojan on the loose MySpace to turn over sex offender data to AGs Microsoft rolls out mashup tool set for nontechies German researchers find new storage medium From vapourware to scareware, Microsoft keeps innovating Penguins in nude girlspace Nudity in 'Halo 2' escapes Microsoft's notice Apple's new MacBooks aren't so different Fatdoor.com, a website that mirrors the real world to let users to connect with their neighbours, launched this week with a new spin on social networking. Instead of anonymous interaction, Fatdoor lets users communicate directly with local neighbours and businesses, says Raj Abhyanker, CEO and co-founder of the company. Abhyanker launched the company with Chandu Thota, who was the lead developer for Microsoft 's Virtual Earth mapping and location tool. Bill Harris, the former CEO of PayPal and Intuit, is an investor and chairman of the company. "We're trying to build something on the internet that mirrors the real world," Harris says. "We call it a local community network. It is a social network that is based around the place you live and the ... people you know. It is not an anonymous activity; this is a social network for adults." Abhyanker says he came up with the idea while running for the city council of Cupertino, Calif., in 2005. After knocking on 3,000 doors as part of his canvassing, he noticed that most people didn't know their neighbours. He said he began thinking about how to use the web to "enhance neighbourhoods, to give the power to the few who are very active to use for the common benefit of all neighbours." The first release of Fatdoor is open to residents of Silicon Valley, with later releases expanding the site cities and towns throughout the US. The site was built using Virtual Earth maps, showing specific house and businesses as icons. The icons can be "claimed" by users to hold their online profiles, which can be viewed by others in the neighbourhood looking for specific services, to start a club or for other purposes, Abhyanker says. As users add content, their neighbours can learn about local events or business deals, he adds. The goal is to foster a group of active users in the neighbourhood who can self-regulate content using the Wikipedia model. Eventually, Abhyanker says, Fatdoor could be used by community activists or civic groups for various projects, such as producing a neighbourhood newspaper, he adds. Harris says the business model for Fatdoor calls for the site to eventually be supported by national and local advertisers eager to target users in specific locations. The site will first list all businesses in the local Yellow Pages and then allow each of those companies to personalise the listings, he says. Users can then add reviews and comments about the businesses.

The question is: why didn't T. rex eat other ark animals? SIX days, phew. I always thought it was a tight squeeze, but thanks to the good folk at the Creation Museum, in Kentucky, I know it's possible. You can create life, the universe and everything in six days. You just have to be God. Forget the time scale, the billions of years of evolution, the Big Bang. Forget the dinosaurs and Darwin's theory. God did it in exactly six days, and then he had a rest. It's all here at the $US27 million ($A33 million) museum, the literal telling of Genesis in animatronics, dioramas, lifelike models of men and women, Noah's Ark and a planetarium. There's a park where visitors can walk through the pivotal moments of creation. Let's start at where God forms Adam from dust (where did the dust come from?), then we can take a loop to where Adam names the animals, look into where Eve is created from Adam's side, see the tree of life and then we can see the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Not forgetting to witness where the ground is cursed and how Adam must toil for food and where Cain kills Abel. You can see all this on the website . The museum expects hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, which is not surprising given that an opinion poll last year in the US by CBS found 51 per cent of those surveyed believed God created people in their present form. Another poll, according to , estimated that 50 million Americans believe in the Genesis view of creation. Of course, people can believe any old thing they like. My grandmother used to say insincere praise from someone was just that person "pissing in your pocket". Though I loved Nan's colourful use of language, as to what she meant, I've no idea. Which is rather a neat evolutionary way back to the museum. I've no idea why there should be dinosaurs at the same time as people. The museum says there were, which leads to the question: how the heck did Noah get that on board his ark? I can understand how you could push a sheep up a gangplank, but a ? Noah must have been a fast talker, or perhaps he had a Schmacko dog biscuit. But then what happened on board the ark? Perhaps all the creatures great and small had a snooze and decided not to eat each other. Still, if people want to believe the universe bloomed into reality 6000 years ago, of course that's their right. The museum calls the Bible "the history book of the universe". Visitors are taken on a journey through that history "based on the 7 Cs of History: Creation, Corruption, Catastrophe, Confusion, Christ, Cross, Consummation". I have two other Cs: the Cradle of Civilisation. It's a crazy idea I know, but what the Sumerians started there I am continuing here on this keyboard as these words are formed &#151; I'm writing. Those clever Sumerians, fancy inventing writing 5000 years ago. You would have thought if they had seen a dinosaur they would have written it down on a tablet. The US has been the battleground between creationists and Darwinists for more than a century. The fiercest fight has been, and still is, in schools, beginning with Tennessee banning the teaching of evolution in the classroom. This led to the celebrated Scopes trial at which, according to America's National Public Radio, defence attorney Clarence Darrow argued that "we find today as brazen and as bold an attempt to destroy learning as was ever made in the Middle Ages". He lost. Fifty years later the state repealed the ban, but the issue of how to teach students about the origins of life has never gone off the radar across the country. The Creation Museum's director is Ken Ham, an Australian. He is a former science teacher who has moved to the US. He told : "You'd never find something like this in Australia." At least on that point, there is no dispute. As to the genesis of life. All the proof is before us, it's just how it is interpreted, he says. Where one might see a rib cage, for instance, another might see the wonder of Eve's creation. In the same week that the museum opened came news of astronomers having found 28 new planets spinning around other stars, raising the possibility of life in the far, far distance. Perhaps one of those planets has a creation museum, too. Who knows? Warwick McFadyen is a senior writer. When you see news happening: SMS/MMS: 0406 THE AGE (0406 843 243), or us.

Having seen the market lead of its NDS directory product gradually eroded by Microsoft's Active Directory alternative and Windows NT, Novell was a company looking for an identity. Buying a way into the open-source community helped it plug right back into the zeitgeist -- and more importantly, made Wall Street sit up and take notice again. Four years on, Novell is still in the game -- albeit not at the level it once enjoyed. Although results for the first quarter of this year show that revenue from Linux products was up by 46 percent compared to a year ago, the company as a whole is just about breaking even. The high-level partnership with Microsoft announced last year provided a short-term injection of cash and tackled some integration issues for businesses looking to marry Linux with Windows. The open-source community was not impressed by some of those issues, consisting as they did of Microsoft's unsubstantiated claims of Linux's software-patent infringement. Some details of the Microsoft pact have emerged, thanks to a SEC filing made by Novell late on Friday; the timing, just before a holiday weekend, raising suspicions that bad news was being buried. The main thing to emerge is that Novell has conceded that changes to the latest version of the General Public License (GPL) -- the licence that underpins the use and distribution of much open-source software -- could prevent a key part of its pact with Microsoft. The fact that Microsoft could see a high-profile and costly deal with an open-source player damaged may explain why the software giant has been on the patent offensive of late. Last week's announcement of a deal with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to fight patents has been seen by some as a damage limitation effort by Novell with the aim of winning back friends from the open-source community. That's a cynical view -- moreover, one that's unhelpful. Only open source's opponents will benefit from splits in the community. Whatever Novell's motivations in its dealing with Microsoft and subsequently with the EFF, the fact remains that if software patents are shown to be the harmful and counterproductive mistake we believe them to be, the industry will benefit in many ways. The community must remain united with this in mind. Nothing else matters. This story originally appeared on Print feature brought to you by GPLv3 threatens Microsoft-Novell pact?

'Google Gears' Shift Web to Offline Google has announced "Google Gears" for developers; an open source technology for creating offline Web applications. "Google Gears" marks an important step in the evolution of Web applications because it addresses a major user concern: availability of data and applications when there's no Internet connection available, or when the connection is slow or unreliable. Reportedly, the new software will run both online and offline, affording users the flexibility to work anytime anywhere, including at the remotest of locations. All the user needs to do is install a plug-in into Web browsers, and the software will open an offline door to applications that till now were accessible only via an Internet connection. Google hopes that in the long term, "Google Gears" will help the industry as a whole move towards a single standard for offline capabilities that all developers could use. Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer of Google, said, "With 'Google Gears' we are tackling a key limitation of the browser in order to make it a stronger platform for deploying all types of applications, and enabling a better user experience. We believe strongly in the power of the community to stretch this new technology to the limits of what's possible, and ultimately emerge with an open standard that benefits everyone." Google is offering "Google Gears" as a free, fully open source technology in order to help not just Google applications but all Web applications. For starters, the Google Reader feed reader (http://reader.google.com) is available with Gears-enabled offline capabilities. Meanwhile, the company also plans to add other programs such as e-mail, calendar, word processing, and spreadsheet to its list of Gears-enabled offerings. As of now, Google has partnered with Adobe Systems to use "Google Gears" in their products. Have an opinion on this product?Disagree with the review?

The technology, called Google Gears, would allow users of computers, phones and other devices to manipulate Web services like e-mail, online calendars or news readers whether online, intermittently connected to the Web or completely offline. By bridging the gulf between new Web services and the older world of desktop software, where any data changes are stored locally on users' machines, Google is pushing the Web into whole new spheres of activity and posing a challenge to rival Microsoft Corp. , leader in the desktop software era.

http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20070530/google_enhances_maps_by_adding_street_view_feature-id-104282.html&cid Google enhances Maps by adding âStreet Viewâ feature - The Money Times Advertise on this site Thursday 31st of May 2007 09:45:30 PM - Loans & Credit - Science & Medicine Bollywood News & Gossip Shopping comparison and reviews Google enhances Maps by adding âStreet Viewâ feature - May 30, 2007 - 0 comments Complimenting its popular mapping technology, Web search giant Google Inc. on Tuesday launched "Street View", a new Google Map service that provides users a street-level picture of downtown areas of various U.S. cities. With the new "Street View" feature in Google Maps, users will be able to view and navigate with a 360-degree view of the selected cities, including San Francisco area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver and Miami. While introducing the Street View at the O'Reilly Where 2.0 Conference 2007 in San Jose, Google claimed that the new feature places Google Map users at the road level, offering them a deeper and more detailed experience of the location than aerial images provide. "With Street View users can virtually walk the streets of a city, check out a restaurant before arriving, and even zoom in on bus stops and street signs to make travel plans," said John Hanke, director of Google Earth and Maps. Initially pitched for selected cities, the street level imagery will soon be available for other metropolitan regions, Google said in a statement. Early last month, the Mountain View, California based online advertising and internet search giant launched âMy Mapsâ, another Google Map service that lets users to create customized maps with specific locations and picture. According to Google, this new mapping tool that can be found in a tab on the left side of the map interface allows users create their own maps to destinations, throwing in their own text, photos and videos for others to see. It even enables non-technical users easily annotate and share maps. Googleâs street-level viewing features are not new as Amazon.com Inc.âs A9.com already has showed street-level views of roughly two dozen major U.S. cities through its BlockView mapping service, which was launched in early 2005. However, it discontinued the feature last year in September. Google on Tuesday also announced the launch of a tool for independent software developers to build mini-applications that can be displayed within Google Maps. Called Mapplets, these gadget applications can display a range of information, from housing listings to crime data. Mapplets will be available in the Maps site for users to choose from and apply to their maps. Mapplets, which currently is in preview mode, can be found in a special version of Google Maps for users who want to try them out. The same day, Microsoft has announced that its Microsoft Live Search Maps service will expand to include more cities worldwide by the end of summer. The world's leading software-producing company last year in November announced the launch of its new mapping service, 'Virtual Earth 3-D' to further add to the services being offered on its Live Search. Microsoft initially included three-dimensional tours of 15 US cities, including San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Detroit, Phoenix, Houston, Baltimore, Atlanta, Denver, Dallas and Fort Worth. Now, Microsoft has enhanced its Live Search Map service by adding 3D cityscapes of U.S. cities Austin, Texas; Cape Coral, Florida; Cincinnati; Indianapolis; Savannah, Georgia; and Tampa, Florida. Northampton, England, and Ottawa, Canada, also will be featured as 3D cityscapes via this service. The 3-D feature lets users zoom in and out of these urban areas and get a three-dimensional view of buildings, terrain, and the like. Until now, the earth was flat for us, but websites such as Google Earth have given us a bird's eye view of the world. Googleâs popular Earth software allows a third of the worldâs population obtain aerial views of their homes and neighborhoods. The largest search engine on the Web, Google has distributed more than 100 million free copies of Earth since June 2005. Google Maps software is tied to search engine giant's online service and informs users about traffic conditions in 30 U.S. cities, provides driving directions, movable/scalable maps, and local search results for business locations as well as satellite and aerial views. Google Maps is currently the third-most popular map site after Time Warner Inc.'s AOL online businessâs Mapquest and Yahoo Maps, which already offer similar function.

Need for Speed screeches up ProStreet New title in the popular EA driving game franchise announced, will be coming to multiple formats this autumn. am PT Need for Speed will be steered in a new direction in its latest iteration, titled Need for Speed ProStreet, which is being developed by Electronic Arts Black Box studio in Vancouver, Canada. Focused on racing showdowns against top street racers, the title promises "impeccable precision and impressively detailed photo-realistic graphics." The new game will show dents, scratches, and crumpled body panels as the gamer's car collides with other vehicles and objects. For the first time in the series, racers will be able to directly impact their car's performance, as well as personalise its appearance, EA says. Need for Speed ProStreet will also feature an online mode, and an "aggressive and skilled" AI system. The game's executive producer, Larry LaPierre, commented, "This is a game about building the ultimate performance-tuned battle machine, taking it to multi-disciplinary showdowns all over the world and pitting your skills and reputation against the very best street racers." The first Need for Speed game, also developed by EA Black Box, was released in 1994, and a multitude of other games in the series followed, most recently Need for Speed Carbon in 2006. Need for Speed ProStreet will be available on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, DS, PC, and mobile platforms, and is slated for release this fall. &laquo; Back to Today's News to post a comment on this story! BAH! I don't believe it. All what do EA say is just marketing. They tell us that everything gonna be ok' ... but they want make us to believe that. Because if we'll start waiting for this game, we may buy it. like underground style NFS, prefer most wanted style wasn't good enough for me to buy this no matter what. second thought, Gamespot, can we just go without news reports of EA games....forever? The next time I ever want to see EA mentioned in an article, it must include the word "liquidation" next to it. feel this is a stupid move on EAs part. There are enough "realistic" simulator games with Forza and to some degree even Project Gotham. Stay with what works. Go back to the "Most Wanted" formula. Stay away from simulating, or even making weak road games like "Carbon". Of course, I think I would like Carbon over this new game... new game will show dents, scratches, and crumpled body panels as the gamer's car collides with other vehicles and objects. For the first time in the series, racers will be able to directly impact their car's performance, as well as personalise its appearance, EA says." Umm... couldn't you do that before in NFS: Most Wanted? worrying about playing this in XBOX 360... or PS3... or Last Gen... or Current Gen Handheld, PC.... and... even cellphone. liked NFS before Underground. I think that all the customization and details on cars took a lot away from the game play. I just don't like how they made the street racing genre the base of a formerly good franchise. No offense, but every NFS:U game I've played had me make the car longer than drive the car. games are truely multi-platform.... there already too many streetracing NFS games out there.... I mean, it's sickening.... I like the NFS Hot Pursuit games alot more.... runing all around town is boring... make a new NFS, like the old ones where you could drive buses and trash trucks and whatever.... make something diferent You, sir, are part of the problem. Underground 1 and 2 were the worst games in the NFS series, and I'm pretending that they don't exist. detailed photo-realistic graphics." -Not on the Wii... need for Speed. Underground was a really fresh step and a great racing game. U2 is crap: EA messed up in all the cool things of Underground. Most Wanted is more of the same thing. the same Hard-to-master/Easy-to-fail Driving mechanics of U2. The only GREAT thing in MW are the police and the HEAT CHARGED police chases.... But nothing else. Carbon is almost the worse in the series (U2 is really bad) I don't like Carbon at all. And now this. If this game returns to the roots of Need for Speed then IM IN, but if is another underground milking game the Screw you EA. it up, more and more. NExt gen console hardware and software provide for more and more effects, calcs and physics. Hope fully developers can make a next gen game for PS3 and XB360 and then port down to PS2 and not the other way around. Sounds they have a great plan, hopefully the game will be more than meets the eye. Black Box had nothing to do with the original game, and as mentioned, damage was in NFS Porsche Unleashed. Do some fact checking, GS! is milking all of their series now. They have to realize that gamers don't want the same game with nothing more than a few tweaks and graphical improvements, even though we keep buying them. Need for Speed was tired out years ago in my opinion, along with all of their sports lineup. Battlefield and Burnout are really the only EA games I enjoy anymore. Maybe those new IPs they're coming out with this year will be decent. a great game but they should release it like every year and a half or every 2 years. But heck they can realse it every other week if its a good game and so far non of the NFS titles(except underground 2) suck so keep it up! been waiting for games like these on ps2. Thanks EA. too soon for another need for speed game hopefully its better than carbon,it was a good game but not that good I cant Wait For Need For Speed Carb... I mean Most Wan.... Sorry I really mean Undergr...... With one is this again? Please STOP EA! , cant wait for it don't be dense if you don't know where need for speed started don't try and shut other people down you make yourself look bad for it. like being able to customize a lambourghini but lets hope this doesnt turn out to be another GT wannabe tuners belong in need for speed. nfs needs pagani, caddilac, mclaren, ferrari, lamborghini, porsche, bmw, merc, audi etc Will this say that the illegal stuff is away? I mean the fun part of Need For Speed and different were that we did the illeal racing and police came chasing you down. Wll this be over? Sure dont hope so. SumerianDaemon go play Gran Turismo if ya want normal cars back the old fashion Need for Speed with Ferrari ,Lamborgini,Porsche etc. Need for speed should be for supercars ONLY! the way, Porsche Unleashed & Hot Pursuit II already had damage modelling AND the damage impacted the car's performance.... Six years later and they try to sell this as a new feature, sheesh....! is not the first time Need For Speed has had physical and cosmetic damage modeling. It had it in Need For Speed: High Stakes Need For Speed: Porsche Unleashed NFS: PU remains the best game in the Need For Speed franchise. After that, they went to annual iterations, and the franchise has suffered because of it. woukd be nice for them to go back to their roots and make the game fun. I liked Most Wanted and hated Carbon. But Hot Pursuit could make a comeback. I guess the future is focused around online gaming. More of the reason why single player modes are becoming weak. last REALLY good NFS was Hot Pursuit II. I really hate this street racing fad that has entered the scene and wish EA would stop using it. While Underground-Carbon were decent games they CAN NOT hold a candle to NFS: HPII lame can you get ... i think that the sequel master EA is loosing ... so they get desperate PROSTreet>>>PROST in my languege means Stupid ... i think that the next NFS will be named ... "OF THE FUTURE" & tehn they will come back in time )!!! Ough & my favorite car game is FLATOUT till now & by the way BUGBEAR achived the car damege from the first FLatout game they didn't need to get to the 11th game to achive it !!! for speed hot pursuit 2...need to say more??? make a game like underground, underground 2, or most wanted. this game sounds like it is going to fail just like carbon. holy crap, carbon sucked. this mean no police chases? will we get a true NFS game? Never I guess... Oh well, I suppose this game is worth a try anyway. wait wait... damage modeling? sweet! ever a franchise deserved to die its Need For Speed, closely followed by any sports game with the word "Street" in the title. glad to see that they're trying to improve the series...I've been pretty disappointed with the last few NFS games for Speed ProStreet GT / Street Racing Release Date: Q3 2007 Add to My Games Need for Speed ProStreet (PS3) Need for Speed ProStreet (WII) Need for Speed ProStreet (PS2) Need for Speed ProStreet (PSP) Need for Speed ProStreet (DS) Report: Ubisoft eyeing studios Need for Speed screeches up ProStreet PSP upgraded to 3.50 Warhammer beta sign-up opens Aussie game charts: May 21-May 27 DS goes on Aussie tour Latest music headlines from CBS Corp buys Last.fm for $280M Music social networking service will continue to run and will help move CBS' other businesses onto the Internet.

Loving Star Trek is about as dorky as a dork can get. But one Star Trek fan had the last laugh when he sold his one bedroom flat for more than the market value. Tony Alleyne sold his home that he transformed into the deck of the starship Voyager for a staggering $843,242 or Â£425,000. As you would imagine, transforming your bachelor pad into a flight deck is not an easy (or cheap) task. Tony spent nearly Â£30,000 and eight-hours a day for two years working on the project. When completed, he went and did what any shrewd businessman would do: he sold it on eBay.

Google Inc. said on Tuesday it was introducing street-level map views of various U.S. cities, giving Web users a panoramic, 360-degree images as well as the overhead views Google Maps has offered. REUTERS/Steve Marcus SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc. said on Tuesday it was introducing street-level map views of various U.S. cities, giving Web users a panoramic, 360-degree images as well as the overhead views Google Maps has offered. With the new "Street View" feature in Google Maps, street level imagery is available for maps of the San Francisco area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver and Miami, and will soon expand to other metropolitan regions, Google said in a statement. Users looking at Google Maps through a Web browser can navigate around a city, "virtually" walking the streets, checking out restaurants and landmarks and even zoom in on bus stops or street signs to make travel plans. ADVERTISEMENT (article continues below) Google is playing catch-up with street-level viewing features, following in the footsteps of A9.com's BlockView mapping feature introduced in early 2005 and showing street-level views in roughly two dozen major U.S. cities. A9.com, a unit of Amazon.com Inc. , discontinued the feature in September 2006. A9 Chief Executive Udi Manber subsequently joined Google as vice president of engineering. has offered what it calls a "birds-eye" view on parts of its MSN Virtual Earth three-dimensional mapping service for several big U.S. cites since late in 2005. Google also announced plans for "Mapplets," a tool for independent software developers to build mini-applications that be displayed within Google Maps. Mapplets can display a variety of information, from housing listings to crime data as well as ways to measure distances between different points on the map. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo Inc. and MapQuest, a unit of Time Warner Inc.'s AOL online business, all continue to compete aggressively to create new online mapping features, said analyst Greg Sterling of Sterling Market Intelligence. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of Web sites now rely on one of the major online map providers to create hybrid mapping applications, popularly known as "mashups," he estimated. Google made the announcements at the Where 2.0 conference taking place in San Jose this week. More details can be found at http://maps.google.com/preview.

Marois May 30 (Bloomberg) -- Two humpback whales may have found their way back into the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay after wandering off their migration path for more than two weeks. The mother and calf, dubbed Delta and Dawn, were last seen 8:30 p.m. yesterday within 5 miles (8.3 kilometers) of the Golden Gate Bridge. They may have slipped under the bridge overnight and into open sea, said Bernadette Fees, a deputy director with the California Department of Fish and Game. ``It is reasonable they&#39;ve made their way out,&#39;&#39; Fees said this evening. The duo, which wandered off course en route to Alaska, attracted crowds to the banks of the Sacramento River as they meandered upstream starting about May 13. After resisting efforts to drive them back south toward the ocean, the whales thrilled rescuers yesterday by crossing back into San Pablo Bay, just north of San Francisco Bay. ``We all cheered like, `Yay!&#39;&#39;&#39; Jim Oswald, a spokesman for the Marine Mammal Center, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ``It&#39;s been really exhilarating.&#39;&#39; Today probably marked the end of a weeks-long detour during which the whales traveled as far as 70 miles (112 kilometers) off course. By May 20, they had reached a dead end at the Port of Sacramento, northeast of San Francisco. They turned downriver, then spent more than a week stalled in fresh water. Their unwillingness to head back to the Pacific frustrated rescuers, who tried to drive the whales homeward. Scientists fired on the whales with water cannons, played sound recordings of an Orca feeding on a whale and even car- alarm noise to try to force them toward the ocean. Eventually, the whales headed downriver on their own. Marine biologists and veterinarians worried for the whales&#39; health as they lingered in the river. Both animals had cuts on their backs, probably from boat propellers, and they developed skin blisters from the fresh water. The whales were given injections of antibiotics to stave off infections. ``As far as letting nature take its own course and letting them die, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an option because their injuries are a result of human activities,&#39;&#39; Frances Gulland, director of veterinary science at the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, said during a May 23 press briefing. ``We have some obligation to compensate for what we&#39;ve done to these animals.&#39;&#39; Humpback whales, which can live as long as 80 years and weigh as much as 30 tons, were hunted to near extinction until they were listed as an endangered species in the 1960s. There are less than 6,000 left in the Pacific Ocean, according to the Marine Mammal Center. The whales startled rescuers on May 27 by swimming more than 24 miles downstream, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. They moved south along the delta of the Sacramento River, California&#39;s largest, and entered bay waters yesterday. A flotilla of 12 boats accompanied them to offer protection from large ships, and to prevent the animals from turning back in the wrong direction. As the duo returned to saltier waters, their skin conditions improved, Oswald said. When the whales were marooned, crowds gathered at marinas in Rio Vista and the Port of Sacramento, trying to catch a glimpse of the 45-foot (13.7-meter) mother and the 25-foot calf. During the rescue effort, more than 2,600 suggestions from the public poured into a special e-mail account set up by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. One e-mail suggested using helicopters to harass the animals downriver, while another proposed building a fake whale with an outboard motor to lead them to the Pacific. A Navy dolphin squad might be able to guide the whales home, according to one e-mail. And a psychic asked to read the whales&#39; minds. ``There have been some real interesting folks who&#39;ve contacted us,&#39;&#39; Fees said. The rescue team included the Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration personnel, the state Department of Fish and Game and the Governor&#39;s Office of Emergency Services, as well as local law enforcement.

May 22: One of the two lost humpbacks slaps her tail on Sacramento River near Rio Vista, Calif. SAN FRANCISCO &#151; Two lost seen just before sunset Tuesday nearing their ocean home after a two-week sojourn through inland waterways may have slipped back into the Pacific overnight. Rescuers launched several boats in an effort to find the mother humpback and her calf Wednesday morning, but have not spotted the whales, said Bernadette Fees, deputy director of the California Department of Fish and Game "If they have gone out and made their way past the Golden Gate, they have done so quietly," Fees said. &#8226; Click here to visit FOXNews.com's Natural Science Center. The pair were last seen Tuesday night less than 10 miles from the Golden Gate after they passed under another busy bridge and entered The whales passed under the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge on Tuesday afternoon, the last bridge along the pair's route before reaching the Golden Gate. If the humpbacks were able navigate south around Marin County's Tiburon Peninsula and nearby Angel Island, few obstacles would have been left on their route past Alcatraz to the Pacific Ocean.

Authorities sent several boats west of the Golden Gate to try to confirm the whales had returned to the ocean, officials said. "The assumption is if we have not sighted the mother and calf by late afternoon that they have made their way out to the Pacific," Fees said. The duo was first spotted May 13 and got as far as 90 miles inland to the Port of Sacramento before turning around. Biologists originally had planned to attach a satellite tracking tag to the mother humpback, but gusty winds and malfunctioning equipment stymied that effort. Despite the apparently anticlimactic end to the humpbacks' saga, which has attracted thousands to Northern California waterfronts, biologists said the chance to closely observe the pair for so long was invaluable for science. "While they may have gone on their way, we still have the benefit of all the information we haven't had access to before," Fees said. "If we learned anything about these two, it is that they will do what they do when they want to do it." Ariadne Green, 57, of Vallejo, was one of many who came to catch what may have been a final glimpse of the pair Tuesday after traveling last week to Rio Vista, where the whales circled for a week before heading ocean-ward. She described the humpbacks' inland visit as a "profound spiritual experience" but was equally grateful for their departure. "They need to go home now because their health is in jeopardy," Green said. "It's good to know they're on their way back." Biologists said the saltier water where the mother humpback whale and her calf had been swimming since leaving Rio Vista helped reverse some of the health problems caused by long exposure to fresh water. Lesions that had formed on the humpbacks' skin over the weekend appeared to be sloughing off, Fees said. Scientists also reported that a coating of algae that was clinging to the mother farther upriver had fallen away. Recent photographs showed that serious wounds suffered by both whales also had appeared to begin healing, said Rod McInnis, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Antibiotics were injected into the whales on Saturday to try to slow the damage from the gashes, likely from a boat's keel. A convoy of boats had been escorting the pair to protect them from heavy ship traffic in the bay.

Toshiba is no longer an Intel-only shop. The Japanese computing giant says it will buy microprocessors and graphic chipsets from Advanced Micro Devices to power about one-fifth of the business and consumer laptops it sells in the US and Europe. Toshiba, which ranks fourth in the global PC market, expects to save at least 10% in parts-procurement costs by buying the chips from AMD, confirmed a Toshiba US spokesperson. As such, its AMD-powered notebooks, which are slated for release in July, will retail for as much as $82 less than their Intel-powered counterparts, said the Toshiba spokesperson. A spokesperson for AMD in the US declined to comment on pricing or other terms of the deal. Those will be mid- to high end-range notebooks powered by AMD Turion 64 dual-core microprocessors, said the AMD spokesperson. Turion 64 dual-cores are the top-end of AMD's mobile processor range. They come in various models ranging from 1.8GHz to 2.3GHz. Toshiba also will buy AMD M690 series graphics chipsets, which AMD acquired when it bought ATI Technologies AMD declined to comment on whether its antitrust lawsuit against Intel had any bearing whatsoever on Toshiba's move to buy its chips. "We are just very pleased to have Toshiba come on board as customer," said the AMD spokesperson. "Comment beyond that need to be answered by Toshiba." Toshiba did not discuss the lawsuit in relation to the deal. Among its allegations in its original complaint against Intel, filed in June 2005, was that Intel used illegal methods to exclude AMD from the global notebook market. AMD alleges Intel coerced Toshiba and others to buy only Intel chips. "[Intel's] exclusive deals with Dell, Sony and Toshiba alone bar AMD from a third of the world market and half of US domestic sales," said AMD, in its complaint. Dell has since struck a deal to buy AMD chips, breaking a more than two decade-long practice to use only Intel microprocessors. In its 2005 lawsuit, AMD alleged Toshiba, like Sony, was once a "significant AMD customer but, but also like Sony, Toshiba received a very substantial payment from Intel in 2001 not to use AMD processors. Toshiba thereupon dropped AMD." What's more, alleges AMD's complaint, Toshiba execs agreed that Intel's financial inducements amounted to "cocaine," but said they were hooked because reengaging with AMD would jeopardize Intel market development funds worth between $25m and $30m per quarter. "Toshiba made clear to AMD that the tens of millions of dollars of additional marketing support was provided on the explicit condition that Toshiba could not use AMD microprocessors," read AMD's complaint. AMD's legal action against Intel aside, this deal may not be as good for AMD as it first seems. If Toshiba can save as much as 10% on parts-procurement by using AMD chips then it seemingly follows that AMD is selling its wares at a cut-rate price compared to Intel. Because the companies won't discuss pricing terms, it is impossible to say for sure. But if AMD is selling its highest-end notebook chips at a bargain price then the company isn't living up to its promise to compete with Intel on features and not just price. Of course, competing on price is a sound strategy, but against its much larger rival it's a strategy that may not serve AMD in the long run.

Most of the 90-minute interview was spent talking about the "good old days" in Silicon Valley and vague prognostications on the future. That, and a game of reciprocative back-patting. Still, there were a few interesting bits of information for amateur Appleologists on the Internet. The conference began with a question about what each had contributed to the computer industry, to which Gates complimented Jobs&#39; taste and sense of aesthetics. At this point, the conversation devolved into Silicon Valley "war story" material about how many "K" this piece of technology had, though Gates got a laugh with his opening comment about not being Fake Steve Jobs. Jobs&#39; first interesting comment came in response to a question about the relationship between Apple and Microsoft in 1997. If the game was a zero-sum game where if Apple wanted to win, Microsoft had to lose, then Apple was going to lose. But Apple didn&rsquo;t have to beat Microsoft. It had to remember what Apple was. At this point, the latest Mac and PC ads came up, and Jobs made a short nonpology. The art of those commercials is not to be mean, but for the guys to like each other. The PC Guy is great... The PC Guy is what makes it all work. Again, Gates was funny, replying that "PC guy&rsquo;s mother loves him." Shortly thereafter, Steve Jobs said that that "Apple views itself as a software company." All the hardware Apple makes, the Mac, the iPod, and soon the iPhone, is nothing more than a "box" to run the software. The is a fascinating insight into the vision of Steve Jobs, and a little disconcerting to me. First, Apple makes most of its money from selling "boxes." More importantly, while that hardware may be nothing special inside, Apple has always striven for unmatched industrial design on the outside. This is not to say that Apple is getting out of the hardware business, though. Jobs put to rest any conspiracy pinhead theory about Apple doing that when talking about personal technology in the next five to ten years. The PC has been very resilient. Its death has been predicted many times. But the Internet came around and invigorated it. And then it plateaued again. And then digital media came around and invigorated it again. And so I think the PC is going to continue to be with us. Finally, there was an item of great interest to those of us who have suffered with .Mac, which apparently must include tech guru Walt Mossberg. In response to a very restrained point about "not developing .Mac" since its inception, Jobs was surprisingly candid. I couldn&#39;t agree more, and we&#39;ll make up for lost time in the near future. One can only hope. Overall, the interview is pretty tame. I strongly recommend this for those wanting to watch Bill and Steve.

Microsoft Unveils 'Surface' Computing -->) chairman and soon-to-retire chief visionary Bill Gates has been touting alternative forms of computer-human interaction for years, such as tablet computing and voice recognition. On Wednesday, the company said it will deliver on that promise by the end of the year with a device that presents information using an intuitive touch-screen interface based on a display embedded in a table top. The announcement, made by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, came at The Wall Street Journal 's "D: All Things Digital" conference being held this week in Carlsbad, Calif. Dubbed Microsoft Surface, the computer and its interface is the result of six years of collaboration between the company's hardware and Microsoft Research (MSR) divisions. But far from being a research project never meant to see the light of day, the company announced four launch customers for the product. That doesn't mean you can look for them at your neighborhood computer store any time soon. Right now, at least, the devices are too expensive for the average household. While Microsoft would not reveal the actual cost to customers, they will likely range from about $5,000 to $10,000 each, a Microsoft spokesperson told Instead, Microsoft intends to sell the first versions to commercial enterprises. Indeed, Microsoft executives see markets for Surface in hundreds of thousands of restaurants, hotels and retail locations. Ballmer announced that Surface's launch customers are Harrah's Entertainment, which is looking to initially install them as virtual concierge kiosks in its seven Las Vegas casinos. Similarly, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide will launch Surface at Sheraton hotels and resorts in its lobbies, including the ability to browse for music and download books with the use of a credit card. International Game Technology will create gaming devices and systems via a development and distribution agreement with Microsoft &#150; video poker on steroids anyone? Finally, T-Mobile USA, owned by Deutsche Telekom AG, announced it is looking to use Surface devices as in-store kiosks where customers could compare phones and wireless plans simply by placing them side-by-side on the table top. "Surface is one example of how we're turning our stores into a playground where customers can comfortably explore exciting new products in their own personal way," Bonita Inza, vice president of retail at T-Mobile USA, said in a Microsoft statement. No Mouse, No Keyboard First begun as a joint project between MSR researchers and Microsoft's hardware group in 2001, it has evolved into a commercial product that some analysts say is viable &#150; even innovative. Surface features a 30-inch diagonal square display built into a table configuration. It consists of a computer running a customized version of Windows Vista, a rear projection screen and five cameras that look through the screen to recognize and read items placed on the surface, as well as to track hand gestures and touch. It has wired 10/100Mbit Ethernet and wireless 802.11 b/g and Bluetooth 2.0 support built in. It supports multiple touch points &#150; Microsoft says "dozens and dozens" -- as well as multiple users simultaneously, so more than one person could be using it at once, or one person could be doing multiple tasks. The term "surface" describes how it's used. There is no keyboard or mouse. All interactions with the computer are done via touching the surface of the computer's screen with hands or brushes, or via wireless interaction with devices such as smartphones, digital cameras or Microsoft's Zune music player. Because of the cameras, the device can also recognize physical objects; for instance credit cards or hotel "loyalty" cards. This ability to actually deal with physical objects is one of Surface's unique capabilities. The idea, said Microsoft, is to bridge the physical and virtual worlds. "It's very intuitive to use &#91;and&#93; it's not like anything else out there," Matt Rosoff, analyst for consumer strategy and corporate affairs at industry newsletter Directions on Microsoft, told . "It's a new category &#91;and&#93; I think it's very innovative." Want to move digital pictures around on the tabletop? Use your finger to push them around so you can see them better. Need to resize a favorite shot? Grab two opposite corners with your fingers and drag them apart to enlarge it. For instance, a user could set a digital camera down on the tabletop and wirelessly transfer pictures into folders on Surface's hard drive. Or setting a music player down would let a user drag songs from his or her home music collection directly into the player, or between two players, using a finger &#150; or transfer mapping information for the location of a restaurant where you just made reservations through a Surface tabletop over to a smartphone just before you walk out the door. Plan a day out. And whereas Microsoft usually doesn't build hardware to sell &#150; like tablet PCs or mobile phones &#150; this time the company smells money. "We see this as a multi billion dollar category, and we envision a time when surface computing technologies will be pervasive, from tabletops and counters to the hallway mirror," Microsoft CEO Ballmer said in a statement. When will all this transpire? Surface will begin surfacing at its four partners&#146; locations by the end of the year, Microsoft says. Microsoft executives also see broader applications for surface computing, including in schools, businesses and homes and in several form factors, such as built into refrigerators, walls, or counter tops. And make no mistake, Microsoft intends to sell a lot of Surface devices into consumer householders a few years down the line &#150; hopefully, in three to five years, the spokesperson said. "It's what Windows Media Center &#91;Edition&#93; probably should have been," Rob Enderle, principal analyst at research firm Enderle Group told . "Even though it's not initially slated for your living room, it would fit well there once the price comes down." Gates and Apple ( -->) CEO Steve Jobs were scheduled to share the stage Wednesday evening for an "unrehearsed, unscripted, onstage conversation" with writers Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, according to the event's producers. to your browser search box Look What eBay Stumbled Upon Microsoft Unveils 'Surface' Computing Computer Reseller CDW Sells For $7.3B Shopping Kiosk Brings Online Benefits To The Store BetonSports Pleads Guilty to Racketeering Charges Bill & Steve Act More Friend Than Foe Brocade to Pay The Piper $7M For Backdating Customize Your New Red Hat Fedora Intel Spearheads Memory Group in a 'Flash' Look What eBay Stumbled Upon

By Eric Bailey, Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTO &#8212; They came, they wandered, they went. After a 17-day sojourn in Northern California's inland waterways, two wayward humpback whales that caught the attention of the nation appear to have quietly slipped back into the Pacific Ocean. By late Wednesday, nearly 24 hours after they were last sighted off the Marin County town of Tiburon, the mother and her calf were nowhere to be seen. Most of the experts mounting a rescue operation concluded that the pair had found their way back to their ocean home. A pair of patrol boats from the U.S. Coast Guard and California Department of Fish and Game hunted the waters off the coast for any sign of the pair, while vessels crisscrossing San Francisco Bay were asked to notify authorities of any sighting. Not a tail slap, spout or sky-scratching breach was seen. "They arrived here quietly, and if they've made their way outside the Golden Gate, they've gone out quietly," said Bernadette Fees, a state Fish and Game spokeswoman. First spotted swimming languidly May 13, the pair arrived in the Sacramento River sporting deep gashes likely inflicted by a run-in with a ship. They wandered into a deep-water shipping channel and into the Port of Sacramento, meandering 70 miles from the sea. In the days that followed, whale experts from around the nation descended on the area to lend a hand. The rescue team received thousands of e-mails and calls from the public, expressing concern and offering suggestions. Northern Californians took off workdays to perch on riverbank levees to get a glimpse. Experts faced a tough balance between giving the whales room to relax and heal and trying to persuade them to head back to their natural saline environment, where their wounds would better heal. The rescue team used clanking pipes, recordings of killer whales and even the geyser spray of a fireboat in an unsuccessful bid to prod the whales past what became their biggest obstacle &#8212; a bustling bridge at Rio Vista. Scientists grew worried late last week as the pair's health continued to deteriorate. By the weekend, the team resorted to administering a dose of antibiotics &#8212; a first for whales in the wild &#8212; delivered with foot-long syringes shot from a .22-caliber rifle. They prepared to launch a massive post-Memorial Day push to move the whales. The whales beat them to the punch. On Sunday, they made their break amid the buzz of holiday jet skiers and boaters on the river. Over three days, they moved purposefully down the river, through the narrow Carquinez Strait and into San Francisco Bay. Seeming to gain vigor, the 20-foot-long juvenile put on a display of leaps and tail slaps as if at play. Tara Cahn, a Sausalito architect, jumped in her car upon learning that the whales were swimming along the Marin County coast. After a few wrong turns, she finally tracked them down Tuesday evening about a quarter-mile offshore of Tiburon. "They were bouncing around, they were playing, they were spouting," said Cahn, who on Wednesday was out looking for them again. "I've been whale watching on Monterey Bay, and this was far more exciting." Scientists say the pair's health rebounded after they returned to the bay's soothing saltwater. Their skin, which grew pitted during their trip up the Sacramento River, was looking slick and slippery by Tuesday evening. "We're still holding our breath a little bit, but we're just so pleased," said Trevor Spradlin, a marine mammal biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, the federal agency that helped lead the rescue effort. Spradlin said scientists are coming away with a treasure trove of insights and observations that will fuel months of research. "We will rigorously and systematically document this case. Really, the only other reference point was Humphrey, and that was a long time ago," he said, referring to the wayward humpback that spent nearly a month in the delta in 1985.

Jobs in a rare joint appearance at a technology conference in Carlsbad, Calif. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: Calif., May 30  In a highly anticipated encounter, Bill Gates of Microsoft and Steven P. Jobs of Apple took the stage Wednesday evening to relive old battles and alliances and speculate about the future of digital culture and technology. Rivals for three decades, the two executives have rarely appeared in public together and have generally been viewed as bitter rivals, despite occasional partnerships. In front of about 600 technology executives at the D: All Things Digital conference, which was sponsored by The Wall Street Journal, the two executives attracted the attention usually reserved for rock singers and Hollywood stars. However, attendees who came hoping for fireworks or a confrontation were disappointed. The mild tone to the session did not take anything away from the event and after discussing the past and present of the computing industry, the two were greeted with a standing ovation. After the event was over a number of the attendees who are veterans of decades in the computer industry said the joint appearance was the most memorable moment of any of the many conferences they had attended. Mr. Gates and Mr. Jobs largely pioneered the personal computer industry beginning in 1975 and 1976 and they spent part of the evening sharing memories of those days. Today "we ship these computers with one or two gigabytes and nobody remembers 128 kilobytes," Mr. Jobs said. Apple and Microsoft were business partners at the start of the computer era beginning in 1977 when Mr. Gates supplied a copy of the BASIC programming language for the Apple II computer. Later, Mr. Gates made an early bet on writing software for the Macintosh, two years before the computer was introduced in 1984. Neither was willing to acknowledge the possibility that the personal computer era they helped create would end any time soon. "The PC has proven to be very resilient," Mr. Jobs said. At the same time they called themselves believers in the explosion of hand-held communications devices, also known as "Post PC devices." Mr. Gates said he was sometimes frustrated by the fact that the players in the industry changed so quickly. "I miss it when people come and go. It's nice when people stick around and it gives us some context," he said.During a question and answer period at the end of the session both men were asked to comment on the other's strengths. Mr. Gates singled out Mr. Jobs intuitive aesthetic sense. "I'd give a lot to have Steve's taste," Mr. Gates said, drawing laughter from the audience. "The way he does things, it's just different." Mr. Jobs returned the compliment, noting that Mr. Gates skills at building business partnerships were something that eluded him in his first decade at Apple. Asked to comment on today's computer industry and the youth culture that it markets to, both men pointed to examples of applications of computer technology that had been readily adopted by seniors. Mr. Gates said that when he showed the Microsoft Surface, the touch computing system introduced on Wednesday to a group of chief executives at his home several weeks ago, he was surprised they were more enthusiastic about the product than he was. The executives, he noted came from a generation that was not comfortable with keyboards. They were particularly interested in a technology that allowed them to control things on a display screen by pointing and moving them directly with their fingers. Neither man was willing to say harsh things about the other and Mr. Jobs summed up his feelings by quoting from a Beatles song: "&#61486;'You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead,' that's clearly true here," he said.

Robert Alan Soloway owned Newport Internet Marketing Corporation (NIM) based in Seattle. He will appear before Seattle's district court this afternoon. Soloway is accused, between 2003 and 2007, of offering broadcast email services which sent messages with false headers and were relayed using networks of proxy computers or botnets. Much of this service was fraudulent - including the claim that email addresses on the lists had "opted-in" to receive such offers. Guarantees regarding the products offered were not honoured and refunds refused. Soloway is also accused of constantly moving his websites to make anti-spam measures more difficult. Since last year his websites have been registered with Chinese ISPs to make proving his ownership of domains more difficult. The false headers he put on emails led many people to have their legitimate email addresses or domains blacklisted by anti-spam groups. The US authorities are seeking $772,000, which Soloway made as a result of his nefarious activities. The Federal Trade Commission received hundreds of complaints about Soloway and NIM. His offences could also earn him a $250,000 fine and five years in prison. The full statement is available Post a new comment What punishment would fit the crime?

Brand new Manhunt 2 trailer PSP firmware updated for new PS3 features Thursday 31-May-2007 8:20 AM Version 3.50 goes live, bringing PSP's Remote Play features in line with its bigger brother A new version of the PSP firmware, version 3.50, is now available, updating PSPs Remote Play capabilities. Last week Sony updated the PS3 firmware (version 1.8) to support Remote Play over the internet, meaning you can control your PS3 (with a PSP) from anywhere in the world so long as you have access to wireless internet. But the option to actually do that on the PSP has been absent, until now. Don't get too excited, Remote Play should really be called Remote Look or Remote Listen, because it only allows you to access media (music, pictures, videos) stored on your PS3, not play its games through your PSP. The RSS menu has also been given a small tweak, now boasting an RSS Channel Guide, for the RSS n00bs out there. If you've got wireless internet you can update your PSP directly by going to the Update System option on the XMB. Otherwise you can download it straight from Sony , and transfer the file to your PSP via USB cable.

As an owner of a PS3 and PSP, I'm still not quite sold on their Remote Play feature, where you can access media files stored on your PS3 from your PSP, wherever you are in the world. It's neat in theory, but relies on a.) your PS3 being turned on when you're on a work trip or holiday, and b.) you not having an iPod or other device to hand with your fave albums and music on it. Nevertheless, if you disagree and are foaming at the mouth for Remote Play, you'll be pleased to hear that Sony has just upgraded the PSP's firmware to version 3.50, which updates the device to take advantage of Remote Play over the network. It's about time too â last week the PS3's firmware was upgraded to support the feature, leaving PSP owners waiting for a similar update before they could use it. According to PSPSPS.tv, you now login using your PSN user email address and password, then stream away to your heart's content. To be honest, I'm more excited about the RSS Channel Guide feature for PSP, which should make it easier to browse and sign up for RSS feeds on Sony's device. But then I am a certified nerd.

But the deal also could bring Apple into the middle of a rancorous copyright battle over television shown on the Web. MTV Networks owner Viacom Inc. (VIAb.N: , which is suing YouTube for copyright violation, said it would welcome the chance to license material to Apple. "We're always vigilant about protecting our copyrights. But we would welcome the opportunity to license our content to Apple as we do with all distributors," a Viacom spokesman said. Viacom sued YouTube in March for $1 billion (506 million pounds) charging it with "massive intentional copyright infringement" after finding hundreds of thousands of Viacom-owned videos uploaded to the service without its permission. Apple TV will stream videos wirelessly from the Internet on YouTube, starting in mid-June, the company said. Thousands of the most current and popular YouTube videos will be available then, it said, and the full catalogue will be available in the fall. Apple TV works with iTunes to play users' content -- video, movies, television shows and the like -- wirelessly on a wide-screen television. Apple also on Wednesday launched iTunes Plus, a music download service that has no copy-protection software limiting consumers' use of the songs. It features artists with EMI Group, including Coldplay, The Rolling Stones and Joss stone. Jobs has called on the music industry to allow online retailers like iTunes to sell digital songs without restrictions to give the digital music sector a boost and give consumers what they want. &copy; Reuters 2007.

With the new "Street View" feature in Google Maps, users will be able to view and navigate with a 360-degree view of the selected cities, including San Francisco area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver and Miami. While introducing the Street View at the O'Reilly Where 2.0 Conference 2007 in San Jose, Google claimed that the new feature places Google Map users at the road level, offering them a deeper and more detailed experience of the location than aerial images provide. "With Street View users can virtually walk the streets of a city, check out a restaurant before arriving, and even zoom in on bus stops and street signs to make travel plans," said John Hanke, director of Google Earth and Maps. Initially pitched for selected cities, the street level imagery will soon be available for other metropolitan regions, Google said in a statement. Early last month, the Mountain View, California based online advertising and internet search giant launched âMy Mapsâ, another Google Map service that lets users to create customized maps with specific locations and picture. According to Google, this new mapping tool that can be found in a tab on the left side of the map interface allows users create their own maps to destinations, throwing in their own text, photos and videos for others to see. It even enables non-technical users easily annotate and share maps. Googleâs street-level viewing features are not new as Amazon.com Inc.âs A9.com already has showed street-level views of roughly two dozen major U.S. cities through its BlockView mapping service, which was launched in early 2005. However, it discontinued the feature last year in September. Google on Tuesday also announced the launch of a tool for independent software developers to build mini-applications that can be displayed within Google Maps. Called Mapplets, these gadget applications can display a range of information, from housing listings to crime data. Mapplets will be available in the Maps site for users to choose from and apply to their maps. Mapplets, which currently is in preview mode, can be found in a special version of Google Maps for users who want to try them out. The same day, Microsoft has announced that its Microsoft Live Search Maps service will expand to include more cities worldwide by the end of summer. The world's leading software-producing company last year in November announced the launch of its new mapping service, 'Virtual Earth 3-D' to further add to the services being offered on its Live Search. Microsoft initially included three-dimensional tours of 15 US cities, including San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Detroit, Phoenix, Houston, Baltimore, Atlanta, Denver, Dallas and Fort Worth. Now, Microsoft has enhanced its Live Search Map service by adding 3D cityscapes of U.S. cities Austin, Texas; Cape Coral, Florida; Cincinnati; Indianapolis; Savannah, Georgia; and Tampa, Florida. Northampton, England, and Ottawa, Canada, also will be featured as 3D cityscapes via this service. The 3-D feature lets users zoom in and out of these urban areas and get a three-dimensional view of buildings, terrain, and the like. Until now, the earth was flat for us, but websites such as Google Earth have given us a bird's eye view of the world. Googleâs popular Earth software allows a third of the worldâs population obtain aerial views of their homes and neighborhoods. The largest search engine on the Web, Google has distributed more than 100 million free copies of Earth since June 2005. Google Maps software is tied to search engine giant's online service and informs users about traffic conditions in 30 U.S. cities, provides driving directions, movable/scalable maps, and local search results for business locations as well as satellite and aerial views. Google Maps is currently the third-most popular map site after Time Warner Inc.'s AOL online businessâs Mapquest and Yahoo Maps, which already offer similar function.

Mozilla warned Thunderbird and SeaMonkey that their e-mail software, which shares Firefox's layout engine, may be vulnerable to these bugs as well. The developers recommend that users do not enable JavaScript in Thunderbird or the mail portion of SeaMonkey.

We have room for you and about 30 of your friends. You would be students of course, but you'd also be teachers. Walter (Brian Dennehy)  Cocoon (1985) How do you win in the PC/CE industry? Every engineerevery marketing expert knows the answer. You give em more. More features. More fun. More quality. More bells. More whistles. You give em less. Thats the way the gaming industry does it and conventional wisdom (dont you love that Microsoft MS Word 2002 CD - oem ?) proves it works. After all, everyone knows gamers are 14-24 year old guys who: - love the smell of napalm in the morning and squealing tires - want their women overly endowed and ready for action - like their mechanical and alien competitors big, ugly and without conscience - can sit in their dank rooms 4-8 hours straight without bathing or relieving themselves If any of the other 6+ billion people on the planet buy into the gaming buzz fine. Figure 1 - Global Population Today there are over 6.6 billion people on the planet. All are potential customers for something. All those of us in the industry need to do is figure out what it isboy that was simple! Source  U.S. Census Bureau They dont really count though. You may think of this stuff as simplygames. To the hardware/software folks involvedits serious stuff! Right now the market is on track to become a $50+ billion global business. Even by MS standards thats not chump change! Figure 2 - No Game  Those of us who play them just think of gaming systems as idle time games. But to the hardware, software and subscription service people who make their living in this space it is serious business. Source  Informa Telecoms & Media Ok so its bighuge even. So how would you have like to have been the guys who bounded into Iwata-sans (now president) and Yamauchi-sans (founder and CEO until 2002) offices and said you wanted to develop game systems that wouldnt compete with Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank s PS or Microsofts Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank They want to develop this people-oriented system that anyone could buy and play. They wanted it kid and adult friendly. They wanted to call it something that was part of the family. Just for Fun  The Nintendo swam in the face of convention. It isnt tough to learn, tough to play or tough on the plot. It is just fun to play and easy to learn/master. It has attracted young and old, male and female to the dismay/consternation of Microsoft and Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank . Source  Nintendo Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank were pushing the fast track, Nintendo took the road less traveled. Game reviewers fought each other to write the most glowing coverage possible for the powerhouse Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank , MS systems. Words flowed in adrenalin fashion over the systems and the games. Reviewers flipped coins to see who would review the Nintendo . The losers got stuck with the job. But something went awry in the brilliant MS/ Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank planning and reviewer accolades. Every 10 or 11,000 years I make a horrible mistake. Time to step back and look how and why Nintendo tapped a market that logic (dont you love that Microsoft MS Word 2002 CD - oem ?) says wasnt there. Its a shift in the post-modern world that can help the entire PC/CE. The signs were therewe just didnt pay any attention. The Internet and gaming isnt a 20+ stud domain! - 18-49 gamers are only 44% of the market. 56% is other Figure 3 - Not All 20-Something  Turns out that not everyone who is a potential game system/software customer is 18-24 and male. They are younger and older and alsofemale. Source  Ipsos Insights - nearly 52% of the internet users are female Figure 4 - Female Domination  While men tend to think that men dominate the Internet  and by that definition also gaming  but it turns out women are on the iNet in greater numbersover 51% are female. Source  eMarketer - 54% of the online game players are female - 66% of females watch videos online - 75%+ of the online gamers are women - Women are different from men (surprise!) - Older & younger players like to interact with others Faith Popcorn, president of BrainReserve, identified two concepts  clicking (pinpointing lifestyle trends) and cocooning (retreating into the home and doing things as a family) years ago. She identified females and families as a dominant force  for long term sales  in the market. Sometimes referred to as the Nostradamus of marketing, her work and predictions rang true for Nintendo and software/online subscription services have gotten the message. Maybe the rest of the industry will follow suit! The worlds demographics are in an important transition: - Nearly 1/5th of Japanese and Italians are 65+and its increasing. The US with 12% age 65 or older ranks 15th in this category - Aging is proceeding rapidly. Japan doubled its percentage in 26 years and the acceleration is even grater in Brazil, Singapore and Thailand - 60% of the women 75+ are widows in Australia, Malaysia, Croatia - Older Canadian women living alone increased 8x between 1961  2001 - By 2050 nearly 1.5 billion will be 65+ and an almost equal number will be 0-14 The big guns in gaming  Microsoft, Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank , and Nintendo  are following different paths. Come on face it. Gaming is a sideline to MS and Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank . Their agendas arent really to give you heart pounding, sweaty palm game action! They want their systems as your home entertainment hubs. If you happen to play a game now and thengreat. But they are adding the features, capabilities and connections you need around the house. Complex stuff they know you need. - Connection to your TV - Connection to your stereo - Connection to your refrigerator, stove - PC things (remember MS wants to rule your world!) They want you to have fun! Theyve got stuff that: - is multiplayer, community focused - is of interest to the casual gamer (the majority of us) - gets you off your fat *** and lets you participate with more than your fingers - makes it fun on a casual, communal, friendly level So what has that got to do with the rest of the industry? In our converged/converging world people want personal communications. Personal solutions. Personal devices. While manufacturers keep adding valueadding capabilitiesadding featuresadding complexityadding cost. Its an unsavory set of design compromises. Theyre compromises that techies love. SONY PlayStation Portable (PSP) is a pretty good game system. Its good for watching movies (lot better screen size than your iddy bitty Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank It can store/play your music. Game On  It just isnt right! Nintendos DS should not be outselling Click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank SONY PlayStation Portable (PSP) . After all the SONY PlayStation Portable (PSP) has superior graphics, movie playing capability, music playing capability, sweaty palm gaming. Nintendo DS Lite Coral Pink ? Just fun. Fun for young and old alike. Maybe simple is better? Source  Nintendo Of course people are hacking it to do all sorts of things beyond that but heythats what hackers do!!! Its a product that is outstripping the SONY PlayStation Portable (PSP) Its a product that could have legs even into 2011 in the U.S. when there will be 59 million kids (0-14) and boomers + of over 90 million. Figure 6 - Tapping The Market  Whether they knew it or it was just dumb luck, Nintendo built systems  and DS  for the marketplace. The older and younger population as well as females and family folks have flocked to the systems and software. So much so that other software developers are suddenly warming up to Nintendo. What can you learn from this shift? Source  U.S. Census Bureau The rest of the population? Well as Walter/Dennehy said I promise you, you will all lead productive lives. Seems to us that Iwata-san was a brain surgeon and Yamauachi-san was a rocket scientist. The guys who suggested the and DS were more than just snake oil sales people. The Nintendo approach so far has shown that the Swiss-army PC/CE solution may get a techies pulse racing but doesnt get everyone into the pool. Consumers  around the globe  want personal products and solutions that they can easily optimize for specific applications, specific activities. Certainly we could be wrong. Or as Ben Luckett said in Cocoon, Well there is the one school of thought that says they don't know nothing. Its time that PC/CE companies takes a closer look at the Nintendo phenomenon and implements those lessons that apply for their firm. After all the lowest common denominator must know something. There are so many of them andtheir numbers are increasing !! has spent more than 15 years in the optical storage, software and video industry, indulging in, among other things, marketing activities in promoting MO, CD, DVD technology and its applications.

Fast-forward to today, and all three of the hardware manufacturers are looking a wee bit foolish. Each has a chance to win this thing â possibly for good â but all they can do is make mistakes and missteps. First, let me tell you about two years ago. Sony kicked things off with a Monday afternoon press conference, despite the fact that E3 actually would only open on Wednesday. Apparently Sonyâs marketing team was convinced that the press would take the time to arrive in LA early just to hear about the PlayStation 3. They were right of course, but then they all they could do was shown canned demos of rubber ducks, and tell us why the PS3 would be a great system when it would arrive in the spring of 2006 (for the record it was late). The message from Sony was that they would always be number one, and the other companies might not even bother. Things were much different that Monday night at Microsoft. The Redmond software giant had traditionally held a Monday night press conference to beat Sony to the punch, but when Sony moved their press conference to Monday afternoon to scoop Microsoft things got interesting. Microsoft âintroducedâ the Xbox 360 a week in advance on MTV, making the whole press conference old news. Then at the press event &mdash; which ran more than an hour late &mdash; featured hired fans on stage to convince the media that this would be the system to back. Hype does not equal buzz, but someone forgot that rule. And finally there was poor Nintendo. The company once again lacked enough chairs for the millions of people that showed up for their press conference &mdash; OK, maybe it only felt like millions. Then Nintendo proceeded once again to ignore technological advances that gamers seemed (at least at the time) to be clamoring to have in their systems. With this yearâs E3 just over a month and a half away, these same companies seem to be continually dropping the ball. At this point it is way too early to even guess who will be out in top when the dust settles, so feel free to post your opinions. But hereâs a quick run down of why these companies are their own worst enemies. The house that Mario built promised in 2005 not to be last to market. Yeah, while we heard that before, and will probably hear it again. Being last to the market is fine, but donât make promises you canât keep. Instead make systems! And get those systems on store shelves. In fairness, Nintendo did a great job of delivering plenty of Wii systems for launch day. But in the months since that brisk November launch systems have been harder to find than Lindsay Lohan on a movie set. Also in fairness, Ms. Lohan will eventually turn up, possibly even sober, but the Wii might be seen on store shelves in mass qualities until 2009! What is up with this supply chain problem? Didnât the executives expect this type of demand, or were they having doubts as the launched date approached? The company finally has a runaway hit and theyâre blowing it (sorry no Lohan comparison here). By the time the supply issues are resolved the rival systems may actually begin to fall in price, and killer app titles will push sales of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Now is the time for Nintendo to be making sales. Their system is arguably the âotherâ console that gamers may buy while waiting for a price cut, or something really worth playing on the PS3 or 360. And this is a problem the company had to have seen coming? By the time more Wii consoles arrive, it maybe too little, too late. Nintendo has always failed to gage the competition ever since they abandoned the CD-ROM add-on for the SNES, which you know went on to become the Sony PlayStation. This might be the one area where Nintendoâs blinders are working to their advantage. People are buying the Wii to play simple games that take advantage of their silly controller. So before this thing goes on life support already, get more games stat! What weâre hoping to see at E3: styled games. The Wii needs more of these to succeed. Skip the Red Steel type shooters. And Mario might help too, and yeah, heâs a fan favorite. But to get that true mass you need games that everyone really knowsâ¦ and thatâs more bowling, pool and simple stuff. Having won the last two hardware rounds, Sony was on top of the world and ruling all it surveyed. Then a strange thing happenedâ¦ a knight saw another crusade. The knight is Sir Howard Stringer, and as head honcho at Sony heâs betting on Blu-ray. This meant that the Sony PlayStation 3 was delayed while the next generation video format was sorted out last spring. And it puts the PS3 on two frontlines. One is the console war, where the system is going up against the Xbox 360 and the Wii, while it is also going up against the HD-DVD optical disc format in another showdown. Entering the latter fray could be a lose-lose situation. Movie studios are already looking at digital downloads and other means of delivery for HD content, so whichever format âwinsâ wonât be ruling for long anyway. Worse for the consumer, adding the Blu-ray drive has meant that the PS3 carries the hefty $599 price point. Yet at the same time this undercuts other stand alone Blu-ray players. Sony has had trouble get enough systems on the shelves anyway, and as result developers are beginning to pull support. All this would be fine, as the game is early, but Sony then confused matters by pulling the $499 version from the market, releasing a model with a larger hard drive in some markets and hinting at the same model in the U.S. Confused? Youâre not the only one. Sony can take credit for outselling the Xbox 360 in April however. But not with the PS3â¦ no, that would be the PlayStation 2. Sony, unlike Nintendo or Microsoft, doesnât want to pull support on their older system. On the one hand why should they, theyâre still racking in money on it. The system is still selling, and they make a lot of money on third-party game titles. But having that system out there is no doubt convincing many gamers to wait for the PS3. This would actually be a bigger problem with a rival system was on the horizon, but without another rival console for a while (we hope anyway), Sony should be in the clear. Still no sale today doesnât help ensure victory tomorrow. What weâre hoping to see at E3: Sony likes to show off big games such as Resistance: Fall of Man . But Nintendo is on to something with easy to play mass-appeal games. A good family game would be great. And a word of advice to Sony: âleave them wanting more.â An epic press conference where you show us everything isnât what we want to see either. First out of the gate in 2005. Microsoft got the early launch, and what did it get them? is still months away, and developers are having trouble with the system. Plus, unlike Sony, Microsoft abandoned their original console. This increased demand for the Xbox 360, but left a lot of gamers in the dark. Microsoft was desperate in 2005, and now that desperation has the company making some strange decisions. The biggest mistake is that they listened to the demands big box retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Target, and released two versions of their console. Sony would go on to make the same mistake too. This confused consumers and meant that some gamers have a 360 system without a hard drive. OK, Microsoft was innovative with the Xbox, but went backward with the Xbox 360 by making the hard drive optional. This has caused headaches for game developers, notably for titles such as the upcoming Grand Theft Auto IV The first thing to do is make a hard drive only game. This will make game development easier, and convince those without one to get with the program. Plus, Microsoft can over charge for the hard drive as another revenue stream. Will gamers complain? Only the few without the hard drive model, and theyâll stop complaining once they realize the benefits. But the second thing Microsoft needs to do is to stop coming up with other hardware upgrades to the system. The HD-DVD drive add-on is nice, but it doesnât function as well as a standalone HD-DVD player, and if Hollywood goes all out on requiring HDMI connections for HD movie playback, then the first generation of 360s will be screwed. And that brings us to the next pointâ¦ if you want to add features such as HDMI do so without re-releasing the system. I know this is a contradiction to what I just said, but this type of hardware upgrade that should upgrade all the systems, and not just be a special edition version. There are some necessary upgrades, but coming up with too many add-ons just screams, âwe forgot to put this in.â . If your executives are going to get a tattoo on their arms (shout out to Peter Moore), then the game should be exclusive. If Ken over at Sony can get the same tattooâ¦ or for that matter say, âI donât need a tattoo to tell you that is coming to the PS3â then donât do it! What weâre hoping to see at E3: Proof that Games for Windows isnât just a back-up plan in case you decide to exit the console hardware arena. Games for Windows is a valid brand, but donât treat it like it is brand new either. I know this was a rant about consoles, and the idea of cross-platform play is incredible actually. However, the PC still gets the shaft when it comes to games (those stupid Mac commercials come to mind). And hand-me-down games such as for Vista arenât convincing us of the power of the system , on the console side what else is coming besides ? What about some of the other franchises such as ? Are we going to see these games ever show up for the 360? We also know Microsoft tried mass appeal with . So enough said on that front. Finally, to all three console companies: Youâve done a great job of keeping our interest up. Wars are bad things, and this includes the console wars. Maybe one of these three systems should go away in the future. Freedom of choice is a great thing, but with three companies it seems that youâre confusing the developers. Let them put all their attention on two console platforms (and Iâm not even thinking of all the handhelds, the PC, etc.). But if there must be three, letâs not see another new console until 2015. By then Iâll be too old to care. This entry was posted on Wednesday, May 30th, 2007 at 10:26 am and is filed under . You can follow comments to this entry through the feed.

Read 1605 times May 30th, 2007 at 11:34 am silly controller? i think not. the controller is state of the art and even the PS3 tried to incorporate it in an unsuccessful way. the reason for the shortages? My theory is that Nintendo is focusing on keeping their loyal owners of a wii, happy. My Wii was defective and I called up the support line and they didn&#8217;t give me any sort of a hard time. They said that they will ship it and when I receive it in 2-3 days, to juts place the defective unit in the same box. place the sticker that was included inside the box on the outside and free shipping was included. I had my new unit in less than 2 days. If they were focusing on just getting units into stores and in turn neglect their already base of customers, i believe that this article above would be focusing on Nintendo&#8217;s lack of support. So basically its a loose loose scenario when it comes to critical perspectives like yourselves to try and just hype hit-counts for your website. Wii is a great system. If you by chance get that 1percent with a defect, rest assured that Nintendo is keeping some replacements at base for you. I think Nintendo is doing the right thing by keeping their existing customers happy. Because in the future console wars, that phone call to customer service could make or break a future purchase for Nintendo.

O'Reilly Where 2.0 Conference 2007 in San Jose, Google debuted Street View, a feature that it said gives Google Maps users the perspective of drivers and pedestrians in a city. That offers a deeper and more detailed view of locations than aerial images provide, Google claimed. The search engine market leader initially is providing Street View imagery in its maps of New York, Las Vegas, Miami, Denver and the San Francisco Bay Area. It said that more cities will be added "in the near future." has been at the forefront of immersive online maps, having introduced in late 2005 so-called bird's-eye views that enabled users to tilt aerial images and view them from different angles. Last November, Microsoft began making 3-D views of cities available in its Windows Live Search Maps software, a feature that lets users zoom in and out of urban areas and get what Microsoft describes as photorealistic views of buildings and other landmarks. On Tuesday, the software vendor of cities for which it offers 3-D views, adding New York and eight other locations. Meanwhile, Google said its new Mapplets technology supports the development of lightweight applications for Google Maps, similar to the way that can be used with the company's iGoogle personalized home page. From a technical standpoint, Mapplets are Gadgets that can be coded to manipulate maps using Javascript calls derived from the application programming interface for Google Maps, according to the company. Previously, developers could build an application on top of Google Maps and make it available on a specific Web site. Now, Google said, developers and end users alike can package multiple Mapplets on a single map to create mashups of the "mini applications" supported by the new technology. Mapplets are currently supported on a developer's of Google Maps for users who want to try them out.

O'Brien explains how Nintendo's new game machine won over the world - and beat the pants off Sony and Microsoft. , Fortune senior editor May 31 2007: 12:02 PM EDT (Fortune Magazine) -- Nintendo's legendary videogame designer Shigeru Miyamoto is lying face down on the floor in Kyoto, Japan, hobbled by a right cross and struggling to regain his composure. The man some credit with the very existence of the $30 billion videogame industry, the Walt Disney of our generation, has taken one blow to the face too many. I'm standing over the creative force behind Donkey Kong, Super Mario, Nintendogs and his latest worldwide sensation, the Wii. I goad him to get up for the rest of his beating. Clearly, one of us is taking our boxing match a bit too seriously. After all, it's not really Miyamoto who has crumbled but rather his avatar - his Mii, in Nintendo parlance. "Ohhh" is about all the man can muster as the clock runs out. Miyamoto puts down his controller and concedes defeat to finish a photo shoot. Nintendo's Miyamoto (left) "boxes" author O'Brien. Iwata holding a DS handheld device, his other big hit. Wii will rock you The next big Silicon Valley IPO Lerach to abdicate his throne Get a look inside the Wiimote Four ways to buy a Wii Go to a store and wait in line. Wii deliveries at electronics and toy stores are sporadic, and the inventory is never guaranteed. The big chains we spoke to advised coming on a weekend morning before the doors open. Persistence pays off; $250 plus local sales tax. Buy one on eBay. They're going for $315 or so, not including shipping. Wait time: two to three days. Buy it used. Used units are sold by private sellers, but they're selling above list price. Expect to pay up to $600, shipping not included. Amazon has new ones too, and they're selling at list with free shipping ... but of course you'll have to wait. At the time of publication the site said only three were available, but more were expected by the end of the month. If price truly is no object, then instruct the pilot of your private jet to land somewhere near Cape Girardeau, Mo. ... As of presstime the Toys "R" Us there still had six, and they'd been sitting on the shelf for two weeks. That'll run you $250 plus the cost of jet fuel. Or roundtrip airfare and car rental for the two-hour drive from St. Louis. 118 years of playing around Nintendo founded in Kyoto as playing-card company. Becomes first company to produce Western-style playing cards in Japan. Strikes a deal with Disney to feature its characters on Nintendo playing cards. Nintendo goes public on the Osaka and Kyoto exchanges. Briefly goes conglomerate: starts selling instant rice and opens a taxi company and a chain of by-the-hour "love hotels." None of it sticks, not even the rice. Develops the coin-operated Donkey Kong arcade game, the company's first international success. Nintendo Entertainment System launches, which introduces Super Mario Brothers and an infrared-gun peripheral for use in Duck Hunt. Game Boy, the world's first portable handheld videogame with interchangeable game cartridges, is introduced. Nintendo 64, the world's first 64-bit home videogame system, premieres. Nintendo GameCube debuts. Mediocre sales. Nintendo DS, handheld that allows wireless multi-user play. Big hit with girls, older folks, and other nontraditional gamers. Wii unveiled in the U.S. With 2.5 million consoles selling in the first six months, it handily beats Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation3. I may have beaten him at his own game, but we both know who's the real winner here. Nintendo's newest contraption has performed exactly as designed, creating yet another Wiivangelist, this time a gloating gaijin 5,000 miles from home who not only got up off the couch to play a videogame but actually worked up a sweat. With this little victory Miyamoto and company gather more momentum in their quest to conquer worthier competition. Videogame controllers generally feature a bewildering array of buttons, and watching an avid gamer work the device, thumbs pattering across plastic, can be intimidating. By contrast the Wii's wireless, motion-sensitive remote, which Miyamoto had been dreaming of for years, often requires no button manipulation whatsoever. In the boxing game my 54-year-old host and I were bobbing and weaving and punching at air - jabs and crosses mostly. Miyamoto, whose official title is senior managing director, would angle his hands from one side to another to avoid haymakers; each time I missed, he'd giggle. And everyone in the room laughed along. While game consoles typically attract youngish males with an antisocial streak, the Wii is bringing people of all demographics together: in nursing homes, for Wii bowling leagues, on cruise ships, at coed (!) Wii-themed parties and, of course, in lines - as hordes of consumers clamor to buy the impossible-to-find $250 machine. Nintendo is churning out over a million units a month and still can't meet demand. How the Wii is creaming the competition At the Nintendo World store in New York City's Rockefeller Center, shipments arrive nightly. In the wee hours customers begin lining up around the block. Doors open at nine, and a few hours later the consoles are gone. In the world's gadget epicenter, Tokyo's Akihabara district, shopkeepers complain about the lack of inventory. Wii displays are covered with SOLD OUT signs, while piles of PlayStation3 boxes carry a different message: 5 percent OFF. Even the Nintendo of America company store near Seattle sees lines of employees, visitors and contractors. Forget about lucking into a Wii at your local It's not unusual for a new game console to sell out during its pre-Christmas introduction, only to see sales dwindle come January. But six months after the Wii's launch, sales are accelerating. Nintendo sold 360,000 boxes in the U.S. in April, 100,000 more than in March. That's two Wiis for every Xbox 360 and four for every PlayStation3. ) lose money on hardware in hopes of seeding the market with their consoles, analysts say Nintendo makes about $50 on every unit. It may not sound like much, but the company plans to sell 35 million of these things over the next few years. That's $1.75 billion in potential profit. Add that to the ridiculous earnings from the company's handheld gaming device, the Nintendo DS, as well as software sales and licensing revenue, and you begin to understand why Nintendo's market cap just passed $45 billion, an all-time high. ( ) trades on the Tokyo and Kyoto stock exchanges and as an ADR in the U.S.) More difficult to comprehend is how a company founded 118 years ago as a maker of playing cards in Kyoto came to be pummeling Microsoft and Sony. The answer has something to do with reinvention. From industry-changing arcade machines to handhelds, 3-D graphics to immersive game play, Nintendo has shown a knack for leapfrogging its industry. Sure, some initiatives failed - a toy vacuum cleaner, a taxi service, a chain of "love hotels" - but the company rarely fails to surprise. And if the Wii shortage demonstrates anything, it's that this time, in changing perceptions of gaming, Nintendo has surprised even itself. In a quieter moment Miyamoto ponders that ability to chart a new course. "How Nintendo has been able to create one surprise after another is a big question even for me," he says. "I'd like to know the answer." The word "Nintendo" is an amalgamation of three symbols: nin, meaning "leave to"; ten, for "heaven"; and do, "company." The most common translation in Kyoto is "the company that leaves to heaven." What that means is open to debate. It could be a resignation to fate, as in "The company's destiny is in heaven's hands." But it's clear from a series of exclusive interviews with several executives over three months in Japan and the U.S. that little is left to chance. Another translation might be "Take care of every detail, and heaven will take care of the rest." The man who oversees every detail is president and CEO Satoru Iwata. Iwata, 47, started as a developer for a firm Nintendo bought in 2000. Since taking over in 2002 he has westernized Nintendo, instituting performance-based raises and a retirement age of 65. To hear suppliers and contractors talk, working with Nintendo is both frustrating and inspirational. It can be Wal-Mart-esque, driving down prices by playing parts manufacturers against one another while challenging them to be more creative. Employees talk breathlessly about loving their jobs while grumbling about hectic schedules. Everyone flies commercial. The one person permitted in first class, Iwata himself, has been known to slog to London and back in one day for a press conference. No hotel required. In short, Iwata has made Nintendo as efficient as a bullet train and as stingy as a bento box. The company's 3,400 employees generated $8.26 billion in revenue last year, or $2.5 million each. While exchange rates and fiscal calendars complicate comparisons to U.S. companies, let's do it anyway. Over roughly the same time frame, Microsoft employees generated $624,000 each; Google's performed 50 percent better, at $994,000, though still less than half as well as Nintendo employees. Nintendo's profits reached almost $1.5 billion, or $442,000 per employee, last year, compared with Microsoft's $177,000 and Google's $288,000. Such gaudy numbers aren't the result of mere penny-pinching. Mainly they're a product of the strategic course Iwata has set. When he took over, PlayStation2 was king, and Microsoft, with its Xbox, was challenging Sony in a technological arms race. But Iwata felt his competitors were fighting the wrong battle. Cramming more technology into consoles would only make the games more expensive, harder to use, and worst of all, less fun. "We decided that Nintendo was going to take another route - game expansion," says Iwata, seated on the edge of a leather chair, leaning over green tea in a three-piece suit, a strip of gray emerging along the part in his thick hair. He has an easy command of English but speaks through an interpreter. "We are not competing against Sony or Microsoft. We are battling the indifference of people who have no interest in videogames." The first test of the strategy came in 2004 with the Nintendo DS. Handhelds weren't a new concept. Nintendo had sold tens of millions of Game Boys. But Sony's forthcoming PSP was being touted as a multimedia machine rich in technology and with an ability to play movies. Iwata went cheaper, smaller (the size of the device), and broader (the intended market). The DS has side-by-side screens, one of which is a touchscreen; Wi-Fi; and voice recognition - all to make it approachable and communal. To put those features to use, Iwata conceived what would become one of the bestselling games for the DS, "Brain Age." Based on the brain-training regimen developed by a Japanese neuroscientist, "Brain Age" tests and improves mental acuity. With sales of more than 12 million copies, the title has made the DS a hit in such unlikely places as nursing homes. Iwata also oversaw development of a talking cookbook "game." And of course Miyamoto kicked in, creating the pet-care game "Nintendogs," which has moved more than 14 million copies. As of this spring the company has sold more than 40 million DS devices, compared with 25 million PSPs. So when it came time to launch the Wii, Nintendo already had a model to follow. The typical life cycle of a game console goes something like this: Manufacturer produces or commissions the most sophisticated parts it can come up with and hopes to milk them for half a decade. Both the PS3 and Xbox 360, for example, have processors that are far more powerful than you'll find in most PCs. Each uses high-end graphics chips that support high-definition games; Sony even includes a Blu-ray DVD drive. The boxes are expensive at first. Hard-core game freaks pay dearly to have a console early, but sales really jump in years two, three and four, as Moore's law and economies of scale drive prices down and third-party developers release must-have games. By year five the buzz has begun about the next generation, and the onetime latest, greatest machine can be found at a local garage sale for $50. Rinse. Wash. Repeat. The Wii busted that mold. First, Nintendo used off-the-shelf parts from numerous suppliers. Sony co-developed the PS3's screaming-fast 3.2-gigahertz "cell" chip and does the manufacturing in its own facilities. Nintendo bought its 729-megahertz chip at Kmart. (Not really. But it might as well have.) Its graphics are marginally better than the PS2 and the original Xbox, but they pale next to the PS3 and Xbox 360. Taking this route enabled the company to introduce the Wii at $250 in the U.S. (vs. $599 for the PS3 and $399 for the 360) and still turn a profit on every unit. And while a $250 sticker makes the Wii more of an impulse buy than even an iPod, it's not the pricetag that makes it fly off shelves. As with DS, the Wii comes with Wi-Fi, which gives customers access to the Internet, and features an incredibly addictive Mii channel. Players craft likenesses of themselves (or anyone else; the little cartoons you see throughout this article are Miis), which then appear in boxing, tennis, golf and other games. Get inside the Wiimote The only thing more fun than bowling in your living room with a bunch of friends is having their digital counterparts cheer you on from the alley inside your TV. The experience makes you forget about graphics altogether. You don't mind that your Mii is missing arms and legs. And of course the Wii has that innovative interface, the Wii Remote. The Wiimote, as it has come to be known, features a speaker, a rumble pack that makes the device shake, and even a mystery feature or two that have yet to be exploited, like a microphone jack. (Wii Karaoke perhaps?) But the Wiimote's magic really comes down to a $2.50 chip developed by a company in Cambridge, Mass., called ) or ADI. Known as a three-axis accelerometer ( ), the chip precisely measures movement in three dimensions. At four square millimeters, several accelerometers would fit on your thumbnail. Prying open a Wiimote, ADI applications engineer Harvey Weinberg explains how the innards work. "This is actually a pretty cool piece of engineering," he says. "There's a Bluetooth link in here, a little bitty speaker, and an infrared camera. Of course the most important part is the accelerometer." The camera communicates with the light bar, which sits above or below the TV set. This is important because of a player's tendency to swing the remote wildly while, say, trying to hit a baseball 450 feet. Each time the camera faces the TV, the machine reestablishes a player's whereabouts. "The Nintendo guys were going to get large errors if they didn't figure out how to get absolute position," Weinberg says. "The camera resets the positional error. But they couldn't have gotten it to work with IR alone because most of the time you're not facing the TV. They couldn't have gotten it to work really good unless it was wireless. And they've aggressively chosen components that don't use a lot of power. The whole thing is synergistic." Nintendo designed dozens of prototypes before settling on the Wiimote. Miyamoto says early versions looked more like a control pad. Some were whimsical, some complicated. Designers arrived at the current version by coming back to Iwata's decree to battle indifference, not the competition. Miyamoto realized it wasn't a fear of gadgets that kept the average consumer from playing games. "TV remotes are always sitting out on a coffee table or on the sofa, but videogame controllers - people don't want them lying around," he says. "In that sense we thought we were losing to the TV remote. So we thought, What kind of controller can we create that won't make people afraid to touch it?" Under Miyamoto's creative direction Nintendo has never had a problem coming up with great games. Pokémon, Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda - Nintendo titles have dominated the bestseller list for each Nintendo console. But that's not necessarily a good thing for the company. Third-party games increase consumer interest in the hardware, which sells more software. What's more, the console manufacturer gets a licensing fee for every third-party game sold, and it bears no development costs. "It really is pure profit," says Reggie Fils-Aime, the president and COO of Nintendo of America. "Third-party games can really determine who wins." Fils-Aime, an intense, 46-year-old Haitian-American, introduced the Wii at a trade show in 2004 by announcing, "My name is Reggie. I'm about kickin' ass, I'm about takin' names and we're about makin' games." That opening salvo lit a fire under the gaming media and Nintendo fanboys, and now Fils-Aime is trying to do the same in the game-development community. Where Sony went wrong He's got a good pitch: Because the Wii isn't high-def, a game can cost as little as $5 million to develop, compared with up to $20 million for the PS3. That message, and the fact that the Wii is clobbering the PS3 in the marketplace, seem to be getting across. While Nintendo's own titles still top the Wii charts, third-party titles are selling well. Yves Guillemot, president and CEO of French game publisher Ubisoft, says Nintendo has become the top console maker to work with. Two of Ubisoft's games, Rayman: Raving Rabbids and Red Steel (in which you use the Wiimote like a sword), have sold nearly a million units each. "We looked at the capabilities of the Wii early on and saw that it was solving the most important element in the game industry - accessibility," Guillemot says. Both the Wii and the DS, Guillemot adds, have Ubisoft developers thinking creatively about what constitutes a game. Later this year Ubisoft will unveil "My Life Coach" and "My Word Coach," titles developed in collaboration with a behaviorist and a linguist, respectively. "Nintendo has been very open with us," says Guillemot. "They're willing to do things that are a bit crazy. They see what we want to do and help us to make it as good as possible." It took a while, but the industry's largest publisher, ), has also come around to the Wii. At EA headquarters in Silicon Valley, developers glow at how the Wiimote opens a new aspect of games like "The Godfather" and "Tiger Woods". The company developed a new Wii-exclusive game, "MySims," due out in the fall; it is working with Steven Spielberg on a Wii title; and its latest FIFA soccer game will use Mii characters. "Nintendo is a pioneer," says John Schappert, COO of EA Studios. "They're zigging when others are zagging. It's another growth curve for the industry." "We are successfully moving up the blue ocean," Iwata says. "But once the blue ocean has become big enough for so many people to notice, it is going to change its color to red." Talk about lost in translation. Turns out there's a name for the line of attack Iwata has been taking: the blue-ocean strategy. Two years ago business professors W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne published a book by that title. It theorizes that the most innovative companies have one thing in common - they separate themselves from a throng of bloody competition (in the red ocean) and set out to create new markets (in the blue ocean). Starbucks is an example. There's always been coffee; Howard Schultz gave us the coffee experience. Or Apple, which gave us the iPod and iTunes - and created a new form of entertainment. Iwata set his course before the book was published, but now that he's read it, he feels validated. "Even before someone invented the term blue-ocean strategy, we were exercising it," he says. "It is an unwritten company credo, something that runs deep in our DNA." The Wii's success has done little to convince Microsoft executives they're on the wrong course. The company is positioning itself for a world where people play multiplayer games, download movies and control their TVs through one box. "Nintendo has created a unique and innovative experience," says Peter Moore, who runs Microsoft's Xbox business. "I love the experience, the price point, and Nintendo content." But Microsoft, Moore adds, "provides experiences that Nintendo cannot provide." Of course Microsoft has little more to lose than money, and there's plenty of that to go around. Sony is another matter. Gaming has been the company's profit center for years. Suddenly, when everyone thought the PS3 would solidify Sony's dominance, along came the Wii. With an unheard-of price and few quality games to choose from, the PS3 has produced disappointing sales; the father of the PlayStation, Ken Kutaragi was recently forced to resign his post as chairman of Sony Computer Entertainment. But while he acknowledges a slow start, Jack Tretton, the president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America, thinks it's too early to start talking winners. "You have to give Nintendo credit for what they've accomplished," says Tretton, who's quick to point out that Sony has come out with some innovative controllers too. "But if you look at the industry, any industry, it doesn't typically go backwards technologically. The controller is innovative, but the Wii is basically a repurposed GameCube. If you've built your console on an innovative controller, you have to ask yourself, Is that long term?" Iwata knows the Wiimote alone won't sustain Nintendo forever. But Tretton's question nicely encapsulates two distinct approaches toward innovation. Despite the fact that the PS2, with its seven-year-old innards, is still the top-selling game console, Sony views the world through the eyes of an engineer, seeing an impressive proprietary technology (Betamax, Memory Stick, Blu-ray) and foisting it on the market. From that point of view, less technology is always a step backward. Nintendo takes its cues from the outside world - Miyamoto's garden, for example, which was the inspiration for the Nintendo game Pimkin. Or from the behavior of everyday people, like the way we leave our TV remotes on the couch. In Miyamoto's eyes technology is just a tool, and less of it is often more. "What I want to do," he says, "is to make it so people can actually feel something unprecedented." So what's next for this company, so full of surprises? The Wii gives Nintendo a few options. It could stick with the current Wii for a few years until today's top-end technology falls to Kmart prices. At that point it could introduce a Wii 2.0 with technology similar to today's PS3, but on the cheap. It could cut $50 off the sticker to compete with the price cuts that are undoubtedly coming from Sony and Microsoft. But that's red-ocean thinking. Iwata wants to keep innovating, to do for gaming what Starbucks has done for coffee or Apple has done for music. "The relationship with the Mac or PC to iTunes and the iPod," he says, "that kind of combination may be possible between DS and Wii." Until Nintendo gets more Wiis on retail shelves, all that is theoretical. Iwata says no single bottleneck has caused the shortage, and that has made the problem harder to solve. Because it was targeting a market that didn't exist, the company had no idea how popular the machine would be. And nobody could have known the Wii would still be selling so well as summer approaches. That kind of thing just doesn't happen in the Christmas-centric world of gaming. "We cannot simply make 1.5 times as much or two times as much," he says. "When you're making one million a month already, getting to 1.5 million or two million is not very easy." From the June 11, 2007 issue Economic growth slowest since '02 Wachovia to buy A.G.

May. 29, 2007 AMD will start providing microprocessors to Toshiba, ending the Japanese electronics maker's exclusive ties with Intel, Toshiba said on Tuesday. Most other global PC makers, including Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Acer are already procuring microprocessors from AMD as well as from Intel, AMD's far larger rival with a market share of around 80 percent. Toshiba, the world's fourth-largest laptop PC maker, expects to put AMD processors in about 20 percent of the notebooks it sells in the United States and Europe, which account for about 60 percent of its overall PC operations. The number of Toshiba laptop PCs loaded with AMD chips can be calculated at about 1.1 million units a year as Toshiba's overall notebook PC shipments came to 9.2 million units in calendar 2006, according to research firm IDC. Toshiba plans to put AMD chips in moderate-priced standard models for individual and corporate clients, Toshiba spokeswoman Yuko Sugahara said. "With PCs becoming commodity products, there seems to be a new way of thinking that competition should be introduced even in procurement of such core parts like processors as long as there are no major differences in product specifications," Macquarie Securities analyst Yoshihiro Shimada said. "This could be a message that an era in which Intel took the lion's share of microprocessor profits as the king of PC chips is over." Fujitsu and NEC, Toshiba's two major domestic rivals, procure microprocessors from both Intel and AMD. The value of the Toshiba-AMD deal was not available, but prices of AMD's notebook-use microprocessors range from $86 to $263 apiece in a block of 1,000 units. The Nikkei business daily reported earlier that prices of AMD-equipped PCs are expected to sell for up to 10,000 yen ($82) less than comparable models. Toshiba will install AMD chips in some models to be released this summer, enabling it to reduce parts-procurement costs by at least 10 percent, the paper said. Shares of Toshiba closed up 1.2 percent at 908 yen, outperforming the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index, which gained 0.44 percent.

After Mossberg asked Jobs about the popularity of Apple's music store software and Jobs said more than 300 million copies were in circulation, Mossberg replied: "So that makes you an enormous Windows software developer" "We are," said Jobs. "How does that make you feel?" "We've got cards and letters from lots of people that say iTunes is their favorite app on Windows," Jobs said, then shrugged, paused and smiled. "It's like giving a glass of ice water to somebody in hell," he said. Although the comment likely won't rank with one of Jobs' most famous Windows swipes -- his "The only problem with is they just have no taste, they have absolutely no taste" -- the remark got a loud laugh from the D: audience. Ironically, during a later Q&A with attendees, Jobs acknowledged that he has read some of the entries on "The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs" blog, where an unidentified writer known as Fake Steve Jobs (FSJ) poses as the Apple CEO. On the blog today, FSJ commented on "his" Windows = hell riff. "The analogy isn't perfect," said FSJ. "You can't get out of hell . You can get out of Windows."

The first is the Spring 2007 edition of Microsoft&#39;s Blue Hat Security Briefings where researchers are invited to Redmond "to share knowledge and to educate and help protect customers against common threats." This is the fifth series of Blue Hat briefings and, as usual, Microsoft is hush-hush about the list of attendees and presenters. IDG&#39;s Robert McMillan was able to find out the names of a few hackers on the speaker list &#8212; Robert Hansen (RSnake), David Maynor, John Hering and Rob Thomas &#8212; but details are very scarce. A source tells me Maynor (pictured) and Robert Graham, co-founders at Errata Security, are talking about how to evade security tools and Hansen is giving a presentation on Web application security. Hardware hacker Bonnie Huang is also giving a talk at Blue Hat. Immediately after Blue Hat, the hackers will move to a more informal setting for , an invite-only get-together of around 100 security professionals. ToorCon Seattle (Beta) runs from May 11-13 and features a single track of 20 minute talks and 5 minute lightning talks. The ToorCon Seattle schedule looks very intriguing.

"I have no doubt that global  that a trend of global warming exists," Griffin told National Public Radio's in an interview set for broadcast today. "I'm not sure it's fair to say that is a problem we must wrestle with." NPR made a transcript of Griffin's remarks available Wednesday. "To assume that is a problem is to assume that the state of the Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure it doesn't change," he said. "First of all, I don't think it's within the power of human beings to assure that the climate does not change, as millions of years of history have shown. "Second of all, I guess I would ask which human beings  where and when  are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we might have right here today, right now, is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take." Environmental groups criticized Griffin's remarks as irresponsible. Griffin's remarks suggest NASA is prepared to ignore the findings gathered by its own satellites and scientists, said Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, a nonpartisan watchdog group. "The science performed by NASA as well as scientists around the world shows that global warming is no longer an environmental issue. It's a rapidly advancing human disaster," Clapp said. "Millions of people across the world will face hunger, flooding from a rise in sea levels and water scarcity. To try to hide that by saying we don't know what the climate should be is ignoring the science of his own agency." However, David Mould, NASA's chief spokesman, said Griffin was attempting in his remarks to characterize the space agency's role in assessing environmental issues. "NASA is providing the vast majority of the data on global climate. We analyze some of the data," Mould said. "But the policies beyond the analysis of the data, he was trying to say, are outside the scope of NASA's mission. Others, including Congress, will decide that." Indeed, Griffin said in the interview that NASA is chartered by Congress to study global warming and not to combat it. But Griffin's assessment merely reflects a Bush administration reluctance to address a major environmental problem, according to David Willett, chief spokesman for the Sierra Club, the nation's oldest environmental advocacy group. "What makes it doubly concerning is that NASA is on the front line, really able to sound the warning bell of what's happening to our planet because they get the planet-wide view," Wiliett said. "They have given the scientific consensus already. They should feel an obligation to be looking at the issue of global warming as a problem that needs to be addressed, not as a phenomenon that simply needs to be studied." Last year, James Hansen, the space agency's chief climatologist, charged that a young political appointee in the agency's public affairs branch had tried to stop him from speaking out on his long-standing concerns over global warming. When Congress took issue, Griffin responded with a policy that affirmed the agency's commitment to open scientific and technical inquiry and public disclosure.

Two new museums are opening this summer in the United States and Canada, which present the story of Earth's creation according to the literal teachings of the Bible in the Book of Genesis. The Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, across the Mississippi River from Cincinnati, Ohio, opened on Monday and describes itself as a "counter (to) evolutionary natural history museums that turn minds against Scripture ­ and Jesus Christ, the Creator of the universe." The Big Valley Creation Science Museum is slated to open Saturday in the Canadian province of Alberta. The US has long been more open to the ideas of creation than most countries, but what makes these museums unique is that they tackle Darwin's evolutionary theory head-on, offering up scientific evidence to back the creationist's version of events. Both for example proudly display fossils, bones and high-tech models of dinosaurs. The 27-million-dollar Kentucky museum has what critics described as Disney-like rides and showcases that place prehistoric children among the giant reptiles. The problem according to scientists: dinosaurs roamed the planet more than 60 million years ago. Creationists contend that the world is no more than 6,000 years old and say the museums display "considerable evidence that not only did dinosaurs exist recently, but that humans existed with them," according to the Big Valley museum in Canada. Museums are only the latest battleground in a decades-long struggle for supremacy between the two camps, beginning with a court ruling in Tennessee in 1927 - known in the US as the Scopes Monkey Trial - that upheld a state law barring evolution from being taught in schools. It took the US Supreme Court another 40 years to rule such laws unconstitutional, and another 20 years after that to strike creationism out of scientific teaching entirely. In 1987 the court ruled that creation could be taught in current affairs, philosophy or history classes, but not as a science. Though a majority of Americans believe there was some form of divine intervention in the world's development, proponents of creationism have gained back little ground since the 1987 ruling. According to a 2005 poll by the magazine Science, only 40 per cent of Americans accept a theory of evolution that leaves no room for divine intervention, compared to about 95 per cent of scientists. But a majority also believe that evolution, and not creation, should be taught in science class. That hasn't stopped a vocal group of mainly Protestant, Evangelical Christians from launching efforts to keep creationist teaching in public schools as a counterweight to Darwinism. School boards in various US states over the last decade have tried to place restrictions on teaching evolution - such as a "disclaimer" in textbooks - but none of the initiatives have lasted long. Now, with the opening of the two museums dedicated to creationism, it has been the turn of the scientific community to protest. More than 900 scientists in Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana signed a petition arguing that the museum's teachings were scientifically inaccurate, and voicing concern about the effect it might have on students. "Students who accept this material as scientifically valid are unlikely to succeed in science courses at the college level," according to the petition, launched by the National Centre for Science Education. "These students will need remedial instruction in the nature of science." At least 3,500 teachers from around the US signed an even stronger worded petition charging the organization running the US museum, Answers in Genesis (AIG), with "a nefarious campaign to institutionalize a lie." "This opposition hates the fact that the Creation Museum is showing the world that the Bible's history is confirmed by real science," Ken Ham, president of AIG, wrote in his internet blog. dpa cc prUS-Religion/Science/ FEATURE: The science of Genesis: two museums open in North America By Chris Cermak, dpa = Washington- Creationism, in a direct challenge to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, has found a new means of spreading its message in the United States.

EMI is one of the four big records labels in the world and made a historic contract with Apple when they announced they would sell DRM-free music over the iTunes music service. The entire EMI catalog is going to be available with the exception of &#8220;The Beatles&#8221; records. DRM restricts the sharing of digital music limiting what the user can actually do with what they download and what devices they can enjoy the music on. A DRM-free platform has been the hope of iTunes users for quite some time. Reports that it could be ready as soon as this week as they stated by the end of May they would all be available. The prices for songs would be $1.29 each, which is 30 cents more than the standard $.99 cents per song for the DRM versions.

"To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or have had and that we need to take steps to make sure it doesn't change" NASA administrator Michael Griffin on National Public Radio's Morning Edition. Griffin said he accepted that the planet's temperature has risen about 1 degree centigrade over the last century and that human activity is responsible for the increase, but he questioned the necessity and effectiveness of efforts to fight climate change. "First of all, I don't think it's within the power of human beings to assure that the climate does not change, as millions of years of history have shown," Griffin said. "And second of all, I guess I would ask which human beings -- where and when -- are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take." Griffin's comments drew quick rebukes from advocates of efforts to fight global warming, including some of NASA's own scientists studying the issue. James Hansen, the space agency's top climate change scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, called Griffin's comments "arrogant and ignorant," "It indicates a complete ignorance of understanding the implications of climate change," Hansen told ABC News. released by NASA late Wednesday night -- following the release of a transcript of his NPR remarks -- Griffin re-iterated his position. "NASA is the world's preeminent organization in the study of Earth and the conditions that contribute to climate change and global warming," Griffin said. "...It is NASA's responsibility to collect, analyze and release information. It is not NASA's mission to make policy regarding possible climate change mitigation strategies." Hansen published new research this week that finds the Earth's climate is nearing a "tipping point" where a relatively small amount of further warming will have dire consequences. "If global emissions of carbon dioxide continue to rise at the rate of the past decade, this research shows that there will be disastrous effects," Hansen said in a announcing the research. These include "increasingly rapid sea level rise, increased frequency of droughts and floods, and increased stress on wildlife and plants due to rapidly shifting climate zones."

Goes Green Whales Make It To Sea May 31st, 2007 by Dan All the world is a theater, and the two whales stuck on an international stage for the past several weeks had a happy ending. The mother-calf duo captured international attention as they became lost dozens of miles up the Sacramento River. Scientists, whale enthusiasts &#8212; and soon, anyone watching the evening news &#8212; were captivated by the whales&#8217; inability to right themselves, and concerned by their inability to heal their wounds in the freshwater. Tuesday night, without fanfare or direct observation, the whales are believed to have slipped back into the Pacific. The episode shows that the natural world can provide lasting entertainment, and even a few happy endings. Big Organic Just Got Bigger A Major Realty Co. Goes Green Copyright 2007 Gannett Company, Inc. Lost whales may now be in open sea; Humpbacks haven't been seen since late Tuesday SAN FRANCISCO -- Rescuers have lost the two lost whales. Search boats and helicopters scoured San Francisco Bay and open ocean outside it on Wednesday but saw no sign of the mother humpback and her calf. The pair had been spotted less than 10 miles from the Golden Gate Bridge late Tuesday near Tiburon, Calif. The whales might have slipped beneath the bridge under cover of darkness and returned to familiar waters of the Pacific Ocean after milling around in an inland river delta for more than two weeks. The humpbacks, members of an endangered species that migrates annually between Mexico, Costa Rica and California's coast, presumably are feeding and healing after a risky sojourn that mobilized resources of at least five government agencies, created a local frenzy and captured global attention. Reason for run unknown Why, after so many days in waters as far as 90 miles from the coast, did the whales suddenly decide to make virtually a bee-line run back to salt water? "Really hard to say," says Doreen Gurrola, assistant education director at the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, Calif. "Could be they recognized their route and realized the ocean was nearby. They could have sensed something -- sounds, a chemical change, strong currents -- that made them know they were closer." They may have detected saltier water as they moved farther south in the bay, away from the mouth of the Sacramento River, Gurrola says, though it's not known whether whales have that ability. Or they may have heard their buddies. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) vessel spotted humpback and blue whales Wednesday feeding on krill, a tiny shrimplike invertebrate, near the Farallon Islands west of San Francisco. Researchers will analyze recordings of sounds from those whales to try to learn whether the lost whales could have heard them and followed them out of the bay, says Trevor Spradlin, a NOAA marine mammal biologist. "We know whales communicate and we know sounds travel, particularly low-frequency sounds," he says. The boat saw "whales of all ages out there having a feast," NOAA spokesperson Mary Jane Schramm says As of Wednesday night, the agencies were preparing to shut down the rescue effort, says Jim Oswald, a spokesman for the mammal center. Had the lost pair been spotted in the bay, officials were ready to reroute commuter ferries to keep clear of them. Human efforts to lure the animals back to their Pacific comfort zone -- recorded sounds of humpback and killer whales, herding by boats, fire hoses -- seemed to have little effect. "They moved on their own accord. They weren't reacting to our stimuli," Gurrola says. After swimming around near the Port of Sacramento for days, drawing crowds of residents to riverbanks to see them, the whales headed toward the bay last week. At first, they seemed to be confused by bridges encountered along the way and at one point turned back upriver. By last weekend, they were on the move again, though they hesitated and retreated from the Benicia-Martinez bridge humming with holiday traffic. They finally entered the bay Tuesday. Marine biologists said their injuries would heal faster now that they were in salt water. An encounter with a boat's keel is thought to have caused a 2-foot-long gash and a deep scrape on the mother and a flank wound on the calf. Each got a dose of antibiotics Saturday administered with a gun firing a foot-long syringe. California's lieutenant governor dubbed the mother whale Delta and her calf Dawn, though the juvenile's gender isn't known. The last time a whale swam inland was in 1990, when the famous Humphrey made a return visit after appearing first in 1986 and staying 26 days. Rescuers weren't worried that the whales would starve. Humpbacks don't start feeding along the coast until early May, on a diet of mostly schooling fish such as sardines and anchovies. These whales appeared to have plenty of fat, Gurrola says. "They weren't looking emaciated. They still had that roundness, that girth," she says. "It's when you can see the outline of their backbone that you're really concerned." The whales could have missed the right turn into the Golden Gate, instead swam under the Bay Bridge and kept going south along the east side of San Francisco almost as far as San Jose. That could have extended the daily whale rescue flotilla indefinitely. As it was, as many as 12 boats with more than 40 aboard hovered near the animals, keeping pleasure boats at least 500 yards away and trying to coax the animals to the sea. California's Fish and Game Department, the Coast Guard, NOAA, the Vallejo fire department and the Solano County sheriff lent vessels. California Highway Patrol helicopters helped pinpoint the whales each morning. "It's hard to say how much this cost," says Coast Guard Petty Officer Jon Cilley. "No one has sat down to figure it out." Copyright &copy; 2007 LexisNexis, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. .

Feds Arrest 'Spam King' in Seattle IRS Spoof Targets Execs Through RTF CDW Accepts $7.3 Billion To Go Private Palm Foleo: A 'Smartphone Companion' Samsung Debuts 4-GB Mobile Chipset On Wednesday, Apple launched two new elements within its iTunes Music Store: iTunes Plus and iTunes U. Analysts described the new features as an evolutionary move designed to broaden the iTunes user base. The new iTunes Plus offers DRM-free music tracks encoded in AAC at 256 Kbps for $1.29 per song. Plus launches with EMI's digital catalog, including singles and albums from Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, Norah Jones, Frank Sinatra, Joss Stone, Pink Floyd, John Coltrane, and more than a dozen of Paul McCartney's classic albums. "Our customers are very excited about the freedom and amazing sound quality of iTunes Plus," Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO, said in a statement. "We expect more than half of the songs on iTunes will be offered in iTunes Plus versions by the end of this year." With the release of iTunes Plus, customers can download tracks from EMI artists without limitations on the type of music player or number of computers on which the purchased songs can be played. The iTunes Plus songs will play on all iPods, Macs, Windows PCs, as well as many other digital music players. The iTunes store will continue to offer its entire catalog, currently over five million songs, in the same versions as today -- 128 Kbps AAC with DRM -- at 99 cents per song, alongside the higher quality iTunes Plus versions, when available. Customers can upgrade their library of previously purchased EMI content to iTunes Plus tracks for 30 cents a song, or $3.00 for most albums. EMI called the launch of the DRM-free iTunes content a significant milestone, and NPD Group analyst Russ Crupnick agreed. He predicted DRM in the digital world might eventually cease altogether for two reasons: higher price points are favorable to the industry and DRM-free content could open up new sales avenues. "DRM-free music is a way of getting more people into the practice of buying digital music. The hope is that other music stores could offer content that would get more people into the whole digital music arena," Crupnick said. "To me, that's the next important step. We've got a lot of early adopters coming in. But how do you start to mainstream digital music? This might help." Apple didn't stop there. The company also announced the launch of iTunes U, a dedicated area within the iTunes store featuring free content such as course lectures, language lessons, lab demonstrations, sports highlights, and campus tours provided by top U.S. colleges and universities including Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Duke University, and MIT. "iTunes U makes it easy for anyone to access amazing educational material from many of the country's most respected colleges and universities," Eddy Cue, Apple's vice president of iTunes, said in a statement. "Education is a lifelong pursuit and we're pleased to give everyone the ability to download lectures, speeches, and other academic content for free." with colleges and universities, iTunes U aims to make it easier to extend learning, explore interests, learn more about a school, and stay connected with an alma mater. The move demonstrates Apple's intent to make iTunes more of a community, according to Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering Group. "Apple has traditionally played a strong role in the public school system and now iTunes U goes up the ladder a little bit by offering a music interface that gives people access to content that's not always easy to get," Doherty noted. "We're entering into a phase of our economy where education is becoming more important, so this is a wonderful move for people."

The information scientists gathered includes sound recordings, logs of their behavior and tissue samples from both the mother and calf, which will be analyzed to determine whether they come from a pod of whales that travel between Mexico and California. "All those things are very hard to get. So what we are doing is filling up the knowledge bank on humpback whales in the wild," said Jim Oswald, a spokesman for the nonprofit Marine Mammal Center, a private scientific and rescue organization. The experience also could prove helpful in approaching other stranded whales, he said. After spending more than two weeks trying to coax the whales back to sea with mixed results, officials were ready Wednesday to declare Operation Humpback a success. Since the previously conspicuous whales had not been seen for a full day, officials assumed the duo found their way home, undoing a wrong turn that inspired a range of rescue attempts. The whales, believed to be a mother and calf, were last observed at sunset Tuesday swimming in San Francisco Bay about 10 miles north of the city. A convoy of boats that accompanied the whales across the bay to keep traffic at a distance stopped escorting them when it got dark. Officials think the whales slipped out of San Francisco Bay to the open sea late Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning, when no one was watching. To make sure the whales did not take another wrong turn, two government boats were launched Wednesday morning to look for them in the Pacific Ocean. Rescuers relied on reports from commercial vessels and Coast Guard patrols to determine if the humpbacks still were in the bay. Officials said they will never know why the humpbacks swam 90 miles inland. But their journey marks the first time the same humpbacks were studied in the wild for so long, according to Bernadette Fees, deputy director of the California Department of Fish and Game. It also was the first time that whales swimming free in the wild were successfully treated with antibiotics. The pair apparently were injured by a boat at some point, and officials said their wounds might have played a role in their becoming stranded in the fresh water of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Based on the way their skin deteriorated while they were in the delta, marine scientists now have a clearer idea of how long whales can survive in fresh water, Gulland said. After the whales were spotted near Sacramento on May 13, officials spent days trying to goad them back to the ocean, playing recordings of other whales, surrounding them with boats, blasting them with fire hoses and banging metal pipes dangling beneath the water. Those involved in the rescue effort said they did not know if the methods hastened the whales' exit or hindered it. They tried to strike a balance between getting the whales going and not making the problem worse. "What we ultimately came away with is that many of the techniques had some effect, but none of them could make a whale go in a direction it did not want to go," said John Calambokidis, a scientist with the nonprofit Cascadia Research Collective. Officials speculated Wednesday that antibiotics given to the whales on Saturday to try to heal their wounds may have been a factor in their departure. The pair began their hasty retreat from the delta after receiving them. Biologists said the saltier water where the mother humpback whale and her calf had been swimming since leaving the delta helped reverse some of the health problems caused by long exposure to fresh water. Gulland said she would not be ready to celebrate until Sunday, when she could be more certain the humpbacks were safely on their way. Officials were unsure how much was spent on the rescue efforts, but they insisted the expenditures of time and money were justified, if not required under wildlife protection laws. They urged people who were captivated by the whales and followed their progress to transfer their energy to protecting marine habitats.

http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/national/BO53751/&cid WHDH-TV - National News - Cosmonauts finish a spacewalk to install protective panels on international space station Health & Fitness Expo Closing Bell on Your Cell Send it to 7 Wednesday, May 30, 2007 Email this article to a friend Cosmonauts finish a spacewalk to install protective panels on international space station CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Two Russian cosmonauts climbed out of the international space station Wednesday to install protective panels designed to shield the orbiting outpost from dangerous space debris. Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov opened a hatch on the Russian side of the space station at 3:05 p.m. EDT. The spacewalk ended about 51/2 hours later. "Hooray! We're back home!" one of the cosmonauts said after climbing back into the space station airlock. The only lament from the first-time spacewalkers came at the end, from a cosmonaut who complained about an ill-fitted glove on his spacesuit. Both men were tethered during the spacewalk to keep them from floating away. The station's third occupant, U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams, remained inside. Space debris includes objects such as discarded rocket parts, planetary dust and rocks. Scientists consider it the greatest threat to the space station, orbiting about 220 miles above Earth. Kotov rode at the end of a crane operated by Yurchikhin to reach the stack of aluminum panels about 60 feet from the hatch. The 17 protective panels, each about 2 feet by 3 feet and weighing about 20 pounds, were delivered to the station last December and left outside in a formation dubbed "the Christmas tree." The cosmonauts installed five of the panels on a Russian section of the space station, and the others were to be put in place during a spacewalk next week. Engineers on the ground are able to monitor by radar the largest pieces of space debris -- objects larger than a softball -- and adjust the station's position accordingly, so the shielding will protect against smaller objects. "The consequence of small particles is not so great," said Kirk Shireman, NASA's deputy program manager for the space station. "Then there are the midrange particles. Those are the ones we worry about." An independent safety task force in February said that there was a 9 percent risk that the space station, once completed in 2010, could be hit with space debris severe enough to cause the loss of the outpost or crew members. That risk estimate was reduced to 5 percent if protective panels were installed on Russian portions of the space station. Sections of the space station built by NASA and the Japanese and European space agencies were protected sufficiently against space debris, the task force said. The spacewalk started about 45 minutes late, but a bright moon allowed the cosmonauts to catch up by working through what normally would have been darkness after orbital sunsets. The space station circles the Earth every 90 minutes. Asked by Mission Control in Moscow how it felt in their spacesuits once they were outside, one of the cosmonauts joked: "Kind of cloudy, a bit rainy. We didn't take an umbrella with us." The cosmonauts also successfully rerouted a cable for a navigation antenna that will be used later in the year for the first flight of a new European cargo vehicle. Wednesday's spacewalk was the first of two scheduled a week apart. Yurchikhin and Kotov will perform another one next Wednesday with similar tasks, including depositing canisters containing biological experiments outside the station. Space shuttle Atlantis and its seven astronauts are scheduled to fly to the station early next month. NASA managers on Wednesday began a two-day meeting at the Kennedy Space Center to decide whether to go ahead with the planned June 8 launch. A final decision was expected Thursday for the launch, which previously was postponed from mid-March because of a hailstorm that damaged the insulating foam on the shuttle's external tank.

The Apple TV remote device is one of a number of set-top boxes designed to move digital content from a user's computer to a TV set, a capability that is expected to open internet-based videos to a wider audience. But before Wednesday's announcement, Apple TV was limited to streaming content from the user's iTunes personal library. "This is the first time users can easily browse, find and watch YouTube videos right from their living room couch, and it's really, really fun," said Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive. "YouTube is a worldwide sensation, and Apple TV is bringing it directly from the internet onto the widescreen TV." Thousands of current and popular YouTube videos will be available on Apple TV when the feature launches in mid-June. The website's full catalog will be available by year's end, Apple said. The move could also make the set-top box more attractive to Canadian consumers, who so far have had less use for the device because Apple's iTunes store does not sell video featuresÂ in Canada because of broadcast rights restrictions, which require Apple to negotiate separate deals with Canadian broadcasters toÂ offer programs.

Japan's Toshiba ditched AMD for Intel as a maker of chips for its laptops in 2001. Since then, AMD has been fighting its way back into Toshiba's lineup in a campaign that has accelerated in recent months. The effort finally bore fruit. On May 29, AMD ( ) said Toshiba will use AMD Turion 64 X2 chips in three of its Satellite notebook PCs expected to ship in time for the back-to-school sales season this year. It's an important milestone in AMD's efforts to shake Intel's dominance of the PC chip market. Last year Dell ( ), long an Intel-exclusive PC maker, started using AMD chips (see BusinessWeek.com, 5/19/06, Other vendors like Gateway ( ) and Hewlett-Packard ( have AMD-based systems. The only household-name in personal computing to boast an Intel-exclusive relationship is Apple ( ), but Toshiba had been the last major vendor of PCs running Microsoft's ( ) Windows to claim an Intel-exclusive relationship. The roots of that relationship are a bone of contention between archrivals AMD and Intel and became legal fodder in AMD's antitrust lawsuit against Intel in 2005. Toshiba received a substantial payment from Intel that was provided on condition that Toshiba's notebook PCs contain no AMD processors, AMD alleged in the lawsuit. Toshiba "executives agreed that Intel's financial inducements amounted to 'cocaine,' but said they were hooked because reengaging with AMD would jeopardize Intel market development funds estimated to be worth $25-30 million per quarter," the filing says. Intel has denied any wrongdoing. Whatever the basis of Toshiba's decision to use Intel, frays in the arrangement have been showing for some time. Last year Toshiba confirmed that some of its executives had favored adding AMD chips to its product lineup, but backed away from the change (see BusinessWeek.com, 6/27/06, "Intel Starts to Push Back" According to sources within AMD, a recent shift in sales strategy played a key role in winning Toshiba back. Senior vice-presidents are now working directly with large accounts like Dell, HP, and Toshiba. These executives have the power to make decisions themselves that typically had to go back to AMD's upper management for approval. "We've put some of our top executives in charge of our key accounts," says AMD Senior Vice-President . "And that way we can make more decisions close to the customer without going back to HQ." Seyer is the point man in charge of AMD's relationship with Dell. Ben Williams runs AMD's relationship with HP. AMD didn't immediately name the executive in charge of the Toshiba relationship. The revamp speeds up decision-making in relation to big customers, and the promises AMD makes to them. These decisions had previously taken longer, and required sign-offs by senior execs up to and including AMD Chief Executive Officer Hector Ruiz. A byproduct of the new approach is making sure senior executives get their expectations for PC demand clearly mapped out before huge supply commitments are made. "It's all about making sure we have visibility," Seyer says. It's a lesson AMD learned the hard way. In recent years, AMD had stepped up efforts to court big customers like Dell, which require chipmakers to provide supply guarantees for set periods of time. AMD was happy to oblige, particularly in the run-up to last year's holiday selling season, when it looked like demand would be strong through the end of the year. "The demand from big PC makers like Dell and HP was strong and so AMD responded, and made strong commitments to meet that demand," says analyst Dean McCarron of Mercury Research, based in Cave Creek, Ariz. But AMD's relationships with other, smaller manufacturers began to suffer. Having made commitments to the likes of Dell, AMD found it had demand for more chips than it could realistically deliver. "AMD had to pick: The big PC makers or the channel," says McCarron, using the industry term for the smaller computer makers. "It went with the big PC makers." Intel, meantime, pounced on the channel business, winning back some territory previously lost to AMD. Fast-forward to November, 2006. Big vendors saw their sales projections weren't proving as strong as they had hoped two months prior, and having built all the computers they needed for the holiday season, they didn't need to buy any more chips. Turning its attention back to the channel, AMD found that smaller vendors, having fulfilled their needs with Intel, didn't need many AMD chips. "Everyone pretty much had all the chips they needed sitting on shelves," McCarron says. The result? AMD swiftly lost ground in the market for PC and server chips. By the end of the first quarter of 2007, AMD's overall share of the PC and server chip market had tumbled to 18.7% after having risen to 25.3% in the previous period, according to Mercury. Intel's share widened to 80.5% from 74.4%. It's too early to tell how far the Toshiba deal will help AMD regain those precious percentage points of share, but winning back the Japanese PC maker as well as a new approach to sales are a step in the right direction. is a reporter for BusinessWeek.com.

My first impression of the new Palm Foleo Mobile Companion wasn't positive because the âbig new product announcementâ wasnât what I had expected. I was thinking we might receive a new Treo based on Linux. Or maybe a new Treo form factor with a full-face touch screen, like the upcoming iPhone from Apple. So my first impression of the Palm Foleo Mobile Companion was along the lines of, âWhat is this, some kind of poor-manâs laptop? I want to see the next generation Treo!â And based on some of what Iâve been reading in the discussion forum today, I wasnât the only person who initially felt this way. But after listening closely to what Jeff Hawkins said in Palmâs webcast, I understand his vision, and that the Foleo Mobile Companion is just the first step towards a very interesting and exciting future. The Foleo Mobile Companion wonât be released until this summer, and the technical specifications haven't been clearly defined. But letâs review some of the information we have about the Foleo today: $499 after $100 mail-in rebate 0.94â thick, 6.67â deep, 10.55â wide (basically just wide enough for the full-size keyboard) The amount of internal memory is not known, but there is an internal Compact Flash slot for âbuilt-inâ memory that will be user-upgradable and an external Secure Digital slot for expanded storage. No details on the specific processor, but Jeff mentioned in the webcast that it wasnât a high-end processor so we shouldnât expect too much 5 hours of actual usage (or all day when you consider that it is powered down when you turn it off or close the lid) 10â color screen (1024x600) with VGA output (1024x768), but not a touch-screen Wi-Fi (when within range of a hotspot) or Bluetooth (using your phone) The Foleo works with the Palm Treo running Palm OS, the Palm Treo running Windows Mobile. It should also work with any Windows Mobile smartphone. There is a button mouse in the middle of the keyboard, and a scroll wheel with left and right buttons below the keyboard. There are also four arrow keys for navigating documents. Scroll wheel can be moved one click at a time to move one row at a time or faster movement moves one page at a time. âInstant Onâ so there is no delay between pressing the power button and using the Foleo. Includes a new version of Documents to Go from DataViz for viewing editing Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files. Slight ribbing on the side so it is easy to grip Like a book, the screen can be opened from the front or sides without any latches Running Linux OS with access to terminal interface Allows third-party developers to deliver additional features and functionality (just like the Palm OS and unlike the Apple iPhone) Can be password protected and you can use Treo to automatically unlock when within range What the Foleo is Today While it looks a lot like a laptop, the Foleo is described as the first device in a new category called âMobile Companionsâ. There is a difference between a mobile companion and a laptop, and in order to understand the Foleo it's necessary to understand this difference. Rather than starting with the laptop, we need to start with the original Palm Pilot. The first Palm Pilot was a personal digital assistant that allowed you to keep track of contacts, events, tasks and notes, with the ability to be extended by developers to do much more. Once the mobile phone industry could support it, the Palm OS devices evolved to support wireless networking features such as email and web browsing, becoming a new type of device called the âsmartphoneâ. Over the next few years the Treo smartphone incrementally evolved, gaining more memory, faster processors, better screens, higher resolution cameras (not necessarily better), Bluetooth support, and so on. Life was good and getting better (a possible exception being the frustrated Treo 700p users who waited a year for a maintenance release). But the more powerful the Treo smartphone became, the more obvious it became that there are two irreconcilable desires that users have. We want something with a keyboard that is easy to type on, we want a large screen for browsing the web, and we want our smartphone to be as small as possible so it is easy to carry around in our pocket. Big keyboard and big screens are simply incompatible with small devices. In my opinion, the Treo form factor is by far the best compromise between form and function when compared to any other smartphone. But it is still a compromise. And thatâs where the concept of a âmobile companionâ comes inâ¦ What are the two main problems with using a smartphone for heavy duty email, writing documents or browsing the web? The screen and keyboard are both too small. What does the Foleo do? Its primary purpose is to address these problems by providing a full-size keyboard and large screen that can be used as input and display devices for your smartphone. Jeff Hawkins emphasized this point a few times during his presentation, but it still took a while for the point to sink in for me. Since the Foleo looks like a laptop, I kept comparing it to a laptop, and while some people might be able to use the Foleo instead of laptop, I think that is more of a side effect than Palmâs intention. But just because the Foleoâs primary purpose is to be a video and keyboard extension to your smartphone doesnât mean it canât do a lot moreâ¦ Iâm thinking the Foleo would be an awesome device for browsing the web around the house. Just leave one on your coffee table and if you want to check something on the web all you need to do is open it up, turn it on and start browsing. With the instant-on feature you can be browsing in a second or two using your household Wi-Fi connection. While I love being able to browse the web with my Treo, if I have the choice between a 10â screen and a 2.5â screen, Iâll take the larger screen any day. And if I want to head down to the coffee shop for a bit of reading or writing, or possibly putting together a draft of a presentation for work, I can easily do that with the Foleo. If I need more powerful features I can always copy the files to my desktop PC, but for the majority of things I need to do on a daily basis the Foleo should be fine. What the Foleo is Not (at least Today) While it looks like a laptop, the Foleo is not intended to be a replacement for your laptop. It doesnât have the processing power or memory to run CPU-intensive applications like Photoshop or to do video editing, and it probably never will because major processing power meaningfully shortens the battery life of mobile devices. That doesnât mean the Foleo canât do many things you would normally do on your laptop. It can, just like your Treo smartphone can. But for full laptop functionality, such as being able to run Windows or Mac applications, you will still want a laptop. What the Foleo May Become I believe Palm still intends to continue making smartphones both smarter and more powerful, but with the introduction of the Foleo Mobile Companion I believe Palm now has the flexibility to explore different form factors to address different customer needs. For example, while the current Treo form factor with a built-in keyboard is targeted at users that do a lot of typing on their Treo, some users might be willing to trade the Treoâs keyboard for a larger screen and on-screen keyboard. While on on-screen keyboard isnât as usable as a fixed keyboard, this shortcoming is minimized if you can use a Mobile Companion for your more intensive data entry tasks. Also remember that the Foleo is running the Linux OS, and just like the original Palm Pilot and Palm OS, Palm is going to publish SDKs so that the developer community can build upon this new platform. There is every reason to expect that at least some of the many Linux developers out there will be looking at the Foleo as an opportunity to leverage their skills at building great applications to fill the needs of Foleo and smartphone users. I believe the Foleo is a lot like the early Palm Pilot, the first product in a new category that will evolve in the coming months and years. It may take a while for a lot of people to be convinced that these devices are useful and worth their price tag, but as functionality is added and costs come down, I believe more and more people will start to âget itâ. Like any first generation device, the first Foleo Mobile Companion will have some shortcomings and some of them will be showstoppers for certain users. The initial price is fairly high if you only see the Foleo as a full-size keyboard for your Treo, and the features are too skimpy if you see it as an alternative to a laptop. But Iâm sure that there are a number of smartphone users out there like myself who will immediately find the Foleo a useful companion for their Treo or Windows Mobile device. And I think that, just like in the early days of the Palm Pilot, the number of users will increase over time.

(not case-sensitive) The new iTunes Plus store Apple's new iTunes Plus is now selling unprotected music at a premium price The wave washing away DRM hits Appleâs music service with today with the announcement of iTunes Plus. The DRM-free music tracks do command a premium over the traditional $0.99 protected tracks, with each 256 kbps AAC encoded track costing the consumer $1.29 each. iTunes customers who have already purchased tracks that are now available on iTunes Plus may upgrade their library of previously purchased content to iTunes Plus tracks for just 30 cents a song and $3.00 for most albums. Songs downloaded through iTunes Plus allow customers to use their purchased content without limitations on the type of music player or number of computers that purchased songs can be played on. EMI is the first and only record label with its catalog available on the new service, as . âThis is a tremendous milestone for digital music,â said Eric Nicoli, CEO of EMI Group. âConsumers are going to love listening to higher quality iTunes Plus tracks from their favorite EMI artists with no usage restrictions.â Although only EMI currently stands alone on iTunes, more are promised within the near future. âOur customers are very excited about the freedom and amazing sound quality of iTunes Plus,â said Steve Jobs, Appleâs CEO. âWe expect more than half of the songs on iTunes will be offered in iTunes Plus versions by the end of this year.â EMIâs venture into unchained music isnât only on iTunes â the record company announced earlier this month its involvement with Amazon.comâs new MP3 music store âThis is a tremendous milestone for digital music...â This is outrageous. Since when was Apple the only company to offer DRM-free music? And how is something so obvious and irritating a "tremendous milestone"? I swear, comments like that really irk me. They swear they're doing something special even though it's what the consumers have been craving for a long while. And they're doing it wrong! An extra 30% per song for DRM-freedom? No, they shouldn't be charging extra for something that should be I agree - I also think they should be offered as MP3, since that is the format with the broadest compatibility across devices. AAC may or may not be technically superior, but MP3 is the only format supported by all devices. Apple likes to start with something bad, and gradually make it better and better so that people think they are heroes, e.g., for finally "rescuing" the consumer from DRM. LOL. oooh reading pwn3d me. I didn't notice they were in AAC format. That sucks. Apple's goal was never the broadest compatibility; if it were, they would be selling Windows. Their goal is, arguably, to sell something better. AAC at the same bitrate is better than MP3. It's not Apple's fault if vendors don't support AAC (aka MPEG4 advanced audio codec). That is like blaming Apple for vendors who choose to support WMA... Besides which, what have you done to free us from the yoke of DRM? Apple, at least, has worked with EMI to release DRM free music on the iTunes store. Apple has adopted that format as their own and I don't think its heads and tails better than a good VBR mp3 encoding. They push their format because they can get a bigger piece of the pie with every song sold. Ideally (for Apple) their AAC would take over mp3 as the most popular and dominant format, similar to what Microsoft wants with WMA. If we were lucky, open source formats (such as ogg vorbis) would take over. I suggest you do some reading about AAC ( Audio Coding, not Apple Audio Coding). It's a MPEG standard, and is license-free (ie. no one pays anyone else, certainly not Apple, to distribute AAC content) unlike either MP3 or WMA. There's already a way around Apple's DRM, and has been for a while. JHymn, then once iTunes 6.x.x.x came out and JHymn broke, QTFairUse6 and myFairTunes 6 came out and did the same thing...although you still need JHymn to do the conversion. I don't remember what bitrate the DRM'd AAC is, but if this non-DRM AAC is 256 and the DRM'd is less, that may be worth the .30c USD extra right there to have higher quality source before conversion. They sound fine and all on an MP3 player, but try playing those on high dollar audio systems...the lack of true quality AAC was developed by Dolby Labs and is licensed by them through their subsidiary, Via Licensing. It is NOT free. Everyone who uses AAC pays a royalty to Dolby/Via. See FAQ question #6 - You must pay a license fee if you develop and sell an encoder or decoder. There no license fee for distribution of AAC. Right, and you need an encoder to create the files you intend to distribute......... Unless you steal them I guess. Or did you intend to create these AAC files with the power of positive thinking? Isn't it a milestone though? According to Websterâs, a milestone, when used figuratively, is a significant event in history. Before now you had the choice of: Now we have a fourth choice: I mean, consumers can want something forever but it isn't actually important until it happens right? So when someone figures out how to make gold, that too is a milestone. BTW, the extra 30% is for the double in bit rate PLUS the DRM free. 2.5) Subscription DRM. $10-$15/month for unlimited. For me 1 + 2.5 + 3 is the ideal. 2.5 to try out all kinds of new music for around the cost of a CD a month. 1 to buy the albums I really like and rip them for any use. 3 for impossible to find imports/fan made materials. Beatport, which I've been using for years, sells DRM-free independent labels for $1.29 to $1.99. The music selection is smaller, but you can get FLAC, WAV, whatever. The Apple AAC's can be converted to whatever you want, even huge WAV's if you want. It's not an Apple proprietary standard (only the DRM version is), AAC is an open non-Apple format. It's just the highest quality one can get for a given bandwidth ("by far", I understand) which is an advantage for downloading purposes, esp. for a site like Apple's with they having to provide the total downloading bandwidth of everybody's downloads simultaneously. Helps things fit onto iPods (which most users are using, even if to the sarcastic "not all") better, makes downloading that quality level quicker, and saves their own phone bill a bit (they're not a government run charity). You lose quality when you convert. I wonder why my posting got point-hit though, I don't think I said anything controversial or anything that isn't factually correct (note that the "AAC best" comment was qualified with that being to my knowledge, and that's factually correct whether it really is best or not). AAC is an open non-Apple format. It's just the highest quality one can get for a given bandwidth ("by far", I understand) Does anyone have links to evidence to back this up? The info that I have seen as well as my subjective experience say that AAC is roughly equivalent to WMA at all bitrates, with WMA being reported as better (but not significantly so) That may be true. I haven't personally had anything that plays WMA (anything portable I mean). In any case, both are probably a lot better than MP3 which is most common (for the same filesizes). And as many have mentioned, AAC isn't an apple format, only AAC-DRM is. I only know what I read, and those I read may be "full of it". :-) I haven't personally had anything that plays WMA (anything portable I mean). I guess you've only owned iPods? as far as I know, every other portable player plays WMA, even if only unprotected WMA. Heck, my car stereo plays WMA off a CD or USB flash drive, just not subscription content. (below not addressed to you personally) AAC may have more market share in terms of total number of players in the wild, but WMA is far more standard in terms of number of manufacturers and on-line stores that support the format. Does AAC protection support subscription-style content? I really see that as the future of legal on-line distribution more than proteced purchased or even DRM-free purchased tracks. You get a cookie from me for mentioning Beatport. ;) Of course I do believe I read somewhere that you enjoy listening to EDM, so, naturally you would probably use Beatport. :) It is funny to see this "milestone" coming to the mainstream, since I've been enjoying DRM free music for many years now from non-iTunes vendors. One reason why I never bought into the iPod + iTunes idea. I still think what Apple did is a milestone, because it sells the music that the masses want. We can "thank" the money the big labels are spending for that. Indie label music, while it can have good quality titles, tends to address niche markets (in the long tail). Just because Yahoo offered some music DRM-free at $2 a pop? This is a milestone because THE major player in the online music business is now offering DRM-free tracks. Other indie labels have been offering DRM free music for ages. Nettwerk offer a choice between DRM free mp3's or DRM free .flac files (at an increased cost over mp3). Manowar have been offering their own stuff for download from their own website for a while in mp3 format. A milestone would be better priced tracks in a more open format. This is nothing more than a small stepping stone. Agreed. Not only because it's the major player in online purchasing, but because it's one of the biggest distributors as well. It's great that indie labels have already been doing it, but this could push the big distributors to do it as well. 1. Who are those others who (legally) sell non-DRM music from one of the major companies (EMI, Sony, etc)? Who else now sells the same downloadable EMI tunes? Give me URLs please, although you imply there are many, just one will do. 2. Once they all are converted to non-DRM $1.29 pricing, then non-DRM will be indeed , just as you ask for. It's just that now they offer a 23% discount for DRM'd versions. You may argue that they're too expensive. I agree, I even thought that true with LP's in the 70's. It's about time. I just downloaded iTunes, and going to browse their library. Thinking of which, I could use some new tunes on my Creative Zen MP3 player. Nevermind - I am hating the iTunes environment. btw... I am a Mac/PC user. I'll look for something else for buying/downloading music. The iTunes player is nice on my Mac, but I completely hate the store. Too bad they won't work on your Zen, they are still in iPod format (AAC). I thought they were going to use MP3. Oh well back to Amazon. Can't you convert it to MP3 if it is DRM free? Yes, just find JHymn, and either QTFairUse6 or myFairUse6 on the net and enjoy... You could convert it to MP3 even if it was DRM'd. You would just need some knowhow. As it stands, its cake to covert AAC to MP3 or WMV. I wonder about the audio quality converting from one lossless format to another. Seems like in the end, the file would have quality loss due to the combination of both formats. If they were both lossless there shouldn't be any degredation of quality, but I know that MP3 compression is not lossless. I don't know much about the other compression. I just remember that there is an option in iTunes to convert the format to MP3 as long as it isn't DRM protected. That was what I was getting at. It is already built into the program, so you won't need to use any other converting program. I doubt the AAC's being sold by iTunes are lossless. Can't you convert it to MP3 if it is DRM free? Yes you can. There's already software out there that does this. You lose quality if you convert though. AAC is NOT iPod format. It is not "owned" by Apple and they make no money from it. BTW, it's far superior to MP3. AAC is owned and licensed by Dolby. It's superior at lower bit-rates, this is true, however I personally find the differences vanish very quickly when you go over 200kbps. This is just from personal listening tests with a variety of equipment; those horrible iPod ear-buds, GOOD headphones, a decent PC surround-sound system (worth about $1200) and a high-quality home theater sound system (worth over $5000). Again, personally, I feel that there is very little difference between AAC at 192+ and a good MP3 VBR encode at 192+. At 320 kpbs (what I rip all my tunes at) both are so close to transparent it's not worth talking about. I'd rather have the convienence and flexibility of the open MP3 format. Why is MP3 open but MP4-AAC is not? You keep mentioning that AAC isn't open... but it is as open as MP3 is. The benefit of MP3 is that all devices support it - not just PMPs, but also home and car audio systems as well. I agree with you 100%. But as you stated, at lower bit rates, the AAC does have superior sound. I just think that it's more beneficial for people using flash based players, and only have 8 gigs to play with. Then you can use the lower bit rate, squeeze in some more tunes, and retain more of the sound quality with AAC. Considering the cost of memory and the PMP devices, there is no reason to use low-bitrate anything any more. I mean, how many songs would 4 or 8GB of flash hold at 320KB/s MP3 VBR? If you figure an average of 8MB/song (conservative estimate), that works out to 500 songs for 4GB, or 1K songs for 8GB. My 4G nano has 612 songs (or about 47 hours). The battery lasts 8-9 hours under good conditions... I knew that's why Apple was pushing so hard for DRM free tracks. It's because in one of their thinking sessions they thought of a way to get even more money out of their customers. "How can we charge our customers for music they already paid for?" I don't think most people that use iTunes and iPods would even care at this point. Most people would still want to buy the lower cost music anyway, imo. On the other hand, I think this the way Apple got around their pledge of keeping music at $.99. I know the recording industry and been trying to pressure them to raise prices, but I guess Apple told them they would have to give something more in order to get the price increase. I get the feeling it's that EMI is charging apple more per song if it's free of DRM, and with the way the RIAA has been the past few years, I think that it is extremely likely to be the case. Apple Recognized the outcry from users wanting to download DRM free music, and also wanted to stand by their $.99 per song stance, but if EMI is charging apple $1.05 per song downloaded... that simply isn't feasible. If you look into the financials of Apple, the ITunes store doesn't make a large profit for Apple compared to their other venues. I don't think it is even more then a few cents per song. AppleInsider places it at almost 10 cents per song, which I feel is a bit high; the analyst keeps assuming few people work at ITunes, and random other variables he prefers to low-ball. Anyways though, I just upgraded 25 songs for $6, most came from two albums (30 Second to Mars and MassiveAttack). I did this during lunch so only got a short time to play, but the 30 Seconds to Mars tracks sounded much cleaner/fuller then their 128 cousins (I kept both on my computer to compare); it was a noticable difference through my system. I doubt I will hear a huge difference in my headphones w/ Nano, but through the computer (XiFi-Music and a 400 watt system) it is a definite improvement. ITunes Plus purchases and upgrades are definitely my preference from here on out with ITunes. Didn't they just say they sold 2 billion songs on Itunes last year? Even at 10 cents per (seems low) that's still 200 million bucks pal... Even more important though, since it locks people into AAC format (even without DRM, AAC only plays on Ipods, Zunes (lol all 6 of them), and a handful of Sony players), it sells even more IPODS! ITunes exist to sell IPods; IPods exist to sell Apple as a whole. IPods are one of the best marketing tools we will ever see pushed out; and yes, ITunes locks you into AAC/IPods, this is the entire marketing strategy. As to the 2 billions songs, that is since ITunes bagain in April of '03 till Jan. of '07; so it took nearly 4 years to reach 2 billion (with accelerated growth towards the end). January 17, 2007âAppleÂ® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2007 first quarter ended December 30, 2006. The Company posted record revenue of $7.1 billion and record net quarterly profit of $1.0 billion, or $1.14 per diluted share pril 25, 2007âAppleÂ® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2007 second quarter ended March 31, 2007. The Company posted revenue of $5.26 billion and net quarterly profit of $770 million, or $.87 per diluted share. So lets say they sold almost 750 million songs last year (due to accelerated growth, just a shot in the dark estimate); divide by 4 for one quarter, ~187 million, down to $18.7 million in profit for the quarter estimated based on 10 cents per song. $18.7 Million is a drop in the bucket for Apple compared to a ~$885 million profit in a quarter (average of the first two). Yes, ITunes is profitable; but it is merely a marketing tool which happens to make trump change on the side. Apparently you didn't RTFA. "Applying that estimate to the $1.2 billion in revenue that iTunes is expected to generation in fiscal 2007, he believes the service will generate $0.09 to $0.14 in earnings-per-share for Apple." 1.2 billion THIS YEAR. If we assume each song is 99 cents, that's roughly... (gets out abacus, slide rule, and protractor...) 1.2 billion songs sold this year alone. So that's $168 million IN PROFIT if they estimate 9-14% profit margin (again, sounds very low, they estimated 10% in credit card fees... say what jack? I can open an account with several banks right now that only charge 2%.. how did Apple get such a lousy deal?). That's before the "subscription model" they plan to add which they estimate could add another 900 million in revenue. Being you demand we use your math and not look at what I showed, nor even argue my point, I'll use your math, okay? (I also read the article, and both quartly statements w/ press releases; and as stated before, I feel the analyst over estimated). $168 million in the year, $42 million in the quarter. Once again, it is , as previously stated, compared to Apple's profit streams which have averaged $885 million the first two quarters (less then 5%). ITunes is a marketing scheme, not a profit center for Apple; its returns are the marketing and tie-ins with IPod/Apple. Yes, Apple wants to make money off of it, but the primary return Apple cares about is the marketing/brand loyalty. Also, the credit card fees are not your APR fees like you as an individual would get. Apple, and any other company, is slammed with a percentage fee per transaction. Hence the reason why the analyst says Apple has wisened up to combine purchases so the fees are not as bad. The fees tend to be higher percentages on smaller transactions, this is why historically you would see many retail spaces with minimums for credit cards. What's to stop Creative, SanDisk etc adding AAC support to their players? Why haven't they done so already? And what's to stop people converting DRM-free AAC to MP3 to play on non-AAC players? (Type "aac to mp3 converter" in google) Or, you know, use iTunes to convert to MP3 since you need to have iTunes to buy these songs in the first place. I think some of the others (other than Zune) do support AAC. Nothing stopping Creative unless they just don't want to pay the licensing royalties. Also you CAN convert but you lose quality. It's effing amazing to me.... That after all the complaints about DRMs, Apple does something about it. They finally give the consumer what they are asking for, and still all of you "Apple Bashers" out there want to talk shit about the format, or the price, or the fact that indy distributors have been doing it for so many years. SO WHAT. This is an in-road to DRM free music on a much larger scale. Other distributors will have to follow suit. And with Apple's price being lower than the average $2 that most sites charge, it will drive the prices of the DRM free tracks down elsewhere. Use your head, and try not to jump on the "I hate Apple" bandwagon so quickly. This is a good thing. RE: It's effing amazing to me.... The reason to complain about Apple is they always do the wrong thing. First, with DRM, and now, with the wrong file format. Clearly Jobs knows the right thing to do - he just wants to string the customers along - and they also hope that by changing file formats every couple of years, then some customers will buy the same songs again in the new format. After all, consolidation onto a single file format is of no benefit to the sellers. It is much better for them to have a number of formats that need to be supported, over time. If Jobs truly "cared" about the customers as he seems to claim, he would have done the right thing in the first place. After all, why is DRM-free content commercially viable today, compared to a couple years ago? What exactly has changed? Nothing. RE: It's effing amazing to me.... Silly, you ask what's changed? 1) 100m iPods have been sold, so there is a huge installed base of receptive customers 2) 2.5b iTunes songs have been sold, so there is a huge installed base of iTunes clients and existing customers Regarding format; you champion MP3, do you also want everyone to stick to DVD instead of HD? MP3 is 10 year old technology. AAC is able to obtain higher quality at lower bitrates... important when distributing over the internet. RE: It's effing amazing to me.... My point is that nothing's changed with respect to DRM. I don't see how number of iPods and/or iTunes songs being sold has any relevance. People can "casually copy" or otherwise share music files just as easily as they could 3 years ago. RE: It's effing amazing to me.... Yet you did ask "Why is DRM content commercially viable today..."? Because Apple has sold enough tracks to show that it is commercially viable to sell music. In turn that has created the number one online retailer, enough so that they have the leverage to negotiate DRM free. Who, three years ago, had the ability to do that? Again, the number of iPods and iTunes accounts is directly responsible for giving Apple the ability to negotiate DRM free from EMI. RE: It's effing amazing to me.... Good point - you're probably right about that. RE: It's effing amazing to me.... RE: It's effing amazing to me.... why is DRM-free content commercially viable today, compared to a couple years ago? What exactly has changed? Nothing. Huh? Something monumental, something huge has changed! EMI was willing to sell their stuff w/o DRM. That's huge. And among the majors they still are the ONLY one. If apple decided to sell all their tunes w/o DRM, they'd be sued into bankruptcy in no time in a court case that'd take no time at all it'd be so clearcut. They can't "just do it", no matter what Nike might suggest. Why so expensive per song? I always thought .99 was too expensive per song, and the reason being is if I were to go buy a CD(with inserts, extras, dvd, packaging, retail shelf space, shipping, whatever else) with say 14 tracks on it, I could get it for probably a comparable price. Why aren't the savings passed on to the consumer, there's almost no overhead needed for these and yet we are still paying $1 per song. RE: Why so expensive per song? You don't think Apple has any expenses in selling you songs? How much do you pay for DSL per month? Imagine 10,000 times that (or more). Not to speak of the stuff those pipes connect to. Think they might have an IT center associated with it? How about a large crew of lawyers for all of their negotiations and lawsuits against them (don't think that we don't pay for all the lawsuits against them!). All those nice Apple showtime events in the Moscone center (or whatever) the tremendous bills for those weren't given by the Gates foundation. Oh, companies like EMI, the artists, etc might want some money too. They've got to pay their lawyers as well. P.S. - To mention a long ago thread, they also have to have one of these iTune stores for each country in the EU (recall that the EU was getting them for doing that even though their music company "suppliers" required it of them contractually). The total numbers thrown around would be global. Japan probably doesn't use the same iTune store as the U.S. does either. So they've probably server centers all over the world along with each one's staff and bills that run the place and lawyers for each country, etc. Somebody has to pay for all of that. I recall reports that they don't make much on their iTunes store, it's mostly a reason for people to buy iPods which is where they make the big bucks. RE: Why so expensive per song? Unless you think Apple's data center is more expensive than a chain of B&M stores that have to be shipped physical products, I don't see your point. Having separate "stores" for every EU country costs then tens of man-hours and multiple watts of electricity I'm sure, but is certaily cheaper than actually opening stores there. 9.99 an album is a discount over CDs. 0.99/1.29 a song is a markup for not buying filler tracks. Since I find physical CDs more of a hindrance than a benefit, I see it as a good deal (at least relative to CDs.) RE: Why so expensive per song? I see what you are saying, but I mean I can get a CD without DRM on it and convert it to any file type I want, put it on any number of devices, etc. If you want to you can throw away the cd and stuff when you are done and still save money. I understand apple has costs associated with this, but it seems to my relatively untrained eye that prices are still comparable to cd's, and if this is the case what's the point? Markup for filler tracks seems like a pretty lame idea on their(apple/record companies) parts to me. RE: Why so expensive per song? I save even more money by NOT buying a whole CD. I usually buy anywhere from one to three songs from a CD. That's it. And if I want the whole album then I MIGHT buy the CD IF it's the same price or cheaper than the iTunes version AND I just happen to be at the store to get something else. I don't make special trips for music. It's a waste of gas and time. I can download a song at anytime even at work. $3 vs $10. Hmmmmm. Even at $3.87 for the non-DRM versions, it's STILL cheaper than buying the CD. RE: Why so expensive per song? Ebay ftw... Save money and get the most out of your music. I've purchased many cd's on ebay and paid like 1/4 of the price. RE: Why so expensive per song? Of course a major pure play in music stores, Tower Records, went bankrupt trying to sell in stores. Not sure if that's a shining example for low cost delivery of goods. Stores that sell music in addition to other things makes it hard to tell how well their music sales are going. In any case, financial reports that apple puts out say (to my recollection) that they don't make much profit from iTune sales. How does one explain that if they're making too high of a margin on their sales? RE: Why so expensive per song? Another opinion - the price is too high, I don't volunteer to pay more for a product to support populating the earth with stores or any of their other overheads. In the end it's the same situation as any other reseller, any other product. Some will feel the price is too high and they either lower that price or lose the sale. No, somebody doesn't have to pay for all that. It could be avoided by cutting out the fat. I don't know what's worse... Guess what? No DRM; but they embed your account information onto the track. This is no milestone. It's like you're paying 30% more for compatibility. I still wouldn't buy it. I'd rather buy an real CD. RE: I don't know what's worse... ^-- the real reason Apple uses AAC instead of MP3 RE: I don't know what's worse... Which will disappear once you convert it to MP3. Next. RE: I don't know what's worse... Which will degrade the sound quality of the product which you are now paying MORE for. Great idea. RE: I don't know what's worse... Embedding the owner's name in the track allows the Fair Use applications that people *claim* they want to have while providing tracebility for the illegal sharing that people *claim* they are not interested in. Also, you're paying 30% more for an open format with *twice* the bitrate.

While the phrase "offline web" may seem like an oxymoron, it speaks directly to the goal of Google Gears, which is to increase access to data and applications even when there is no Internet connection available. Google's announcement indicates that Google Gears is a browser extension that is being "made available in its early states so that everyone can test its capabilities and limitations and help improve upon it". In addition, Google is proposing that this concept evolve into a "single standard for offline capabilities that all developers can use". has already implemented Google Gears and as a result is offering offline capabilities. The underlying technology uses JavaScript APIs for data storage, application caching, and multi-threading.

PSP upgraded to 3.50 Sony's PlayStation Portable gets a firmware update to enable remote PS3 viewing. am PT Last week, PlayStation 3 was released, which enabled a variety of extra features for the console including adding the Remote Play ability--anyone with a PSP could then access their PS3 over the Internet. Now a firmware update for the PSP to 3.50 updates the handheld to be Remote Play ready too. Owners of both gaming machines won't be able to access DVD or Blu-ray movies or play PS3 games from their handhelds, but they will be able to access music, other videos, pictures, and their friends lists. Firmware update 3.50 also adds a RSS channel guide for PSP owners who use their portables to receive news and other RSS feeds. &laquo; Back to Today's News to post a comment on this story! I forgot I have a PSP god sakes there are a ton of good games for the psp so the ds fanboys should really shut the hell up already. not to mention that the psp is the most usefull portable device you can buy anyways, if you couldnt even play games on it at all it would still be an awesome machine. this fanboy bull#$%* really gets on my nerves. either way, most ds games are for kids 12 and under. more room wasted on my default memory card lol I dont care what the update is, I just love updating my firmware..LOL... UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE update is good, lmao at the idiot fanboys out there. and gamespot i used to come here everyday looking for news cuz i thot you were not bias, now i know you guys and your website are bias. the record guys, the people in charge of Firmware at Sony have nothing to do with games. So why should they hold back anything they work on until more games are released? The update makes it so you can use Remote Play over the Internet. Before it was just local as in within range of your PS3's wifi. This means I can have my PSP here at work and access my videos, music, and pictures from my PS3 at home. I think this is about the coolest thing ever. we just need the entire library of PS1 games available for download. what an update!!! BLAH is good news from a technological point of view, but it wont do anything better for people waiting for games (like me). Games should be at the first line, and all these tricks and tech upgrades should be the last wheel of the ride because theyll never be more important than a killer bunch of software. the heck, all this stuff isn't new. PSP has had remote play and so has ps3 for quite a while now. will say it's nice to be able to access the PSN store via the PSP and actually purchase and download stuff from a starbox... sony just needs more stuff/games/music/videos update is useless to everyone who does not have a ps3. I want the update that give the psp access to the playstation store without requiring a ps3 to dl ps1 games. It has been promised since before the ps3 was released and sony has not delivered. that's pretty nifty I do the same thing with my Computer and XBOX. It'd be pretty sweet to do the same thing on the road. The PS3 does support avi and ogm files right? . . . . . but how ABOUT SOME GAMES?!!! is good.... for those who own PS3.... I think it is time to upgrade PSP internal upgrades... lets hope sony have the plans.. if they have any. now sony needs to actually use the stand-by mode and allow the psp to access the ps3 without actually having to turn on the ps3. Use that stand-by mode sony cuz right now it feels like i'm just turning off the system. liking this...Im getting ready to head to Iraq and this is going to let me swap media files off of my ps3 while gone...I can see why some people may not feel the need for this but I know I do. If you travel alot it wil also be a nice plus. who thinks this is a dumb idea is a moron. good call sony. only I could afford both consoles cool. i'm glad to see that sony is still moving in the right direction. it is not fanboyish to call this feature pointless. I have both a 360 and a PS3 and PSP. I have checked out the remote play and it is pointless - I don't see myself using it much. is freaking awesome i like the integration between the two systems. thing the killzone pathc is done now they just need to get the sony store out it was supposed to be out this month I can translate all these fanboy comments into regular English: "Dur...remote play is something our console can never do, so let's bash it and say that it's pointless." I have PSP and PS3.... I guessed that good news for me. .... why would i seriously need that? guess you don't need this unless you have a ps3. sounds really cool, but let me get this strait. You have to keep your ps3 on, to access the content over the internet with you psp?....Well that ruins the whole thing. If you could access that content while it was in it's sleep mode it'd be fine. Seems like you could though, their using the ps3 for that folding project so It seems plausible right? Sony , listen our PSP only prayers allready its good... but not great. I mean who keeps their PS3 on 24/7? But i suppose the option is there. The 2.0 update of PS3 is gonna be good though! Loads of new options and features the possible exception of coordinating your friend lists (and that be a brief act at best), I don't see a big draw from this. love my PSP. Can't wait for Final Fantasy and Castlevania! - You are wrong - the PS3 does not have the best network games. Network games funner and bigger? Please - that is flat out a lie. There is nothing really out for the PS3 yet to make it a must have. I have one, but I feel like I wasted my money. Also, I do not see why remote play is a BIG deal. Who uses it that much? Who would want to leave their PS3 running non-stop? For those of you that do not know it will shorten the lie spand of your console. I love my PSP, but really remote play is just ugh crap. awesome, but I don't have a PS3 or Wi-fi. not much of an update. I think Im good for now. sony...we need more psp demos (and ps3 demos too)... After downloading siphon filter on psp i bought it. very cool. this is way cool. now anywhere my psp can access the net i can access content off my ps3 and also off my windows PC. streaming music and video and pictures from my PC to anywhere in the world is way awesome. now if there was a way to turn on your ps3 remotely with the psp...that way i dont have to leave my ps3 running in remote play mode...you listening sony? make it happen... fanboys get a life. why can't u just be happy of this news? its better to have something than nothing, yet even if they did show nothing ud still be talking about ur 360's. Listen, us ps3 gamers have practically already beaten y'all in that perspective becuase not only are our network games funner, but they are also much bigger and have better online,etc. complain about the psp-ps3 remote play but thats because they have never use it...this thing is totally amazing: its like carrying a 80gb memory in your psp! why people are complaining about sony, knowing that right now Im at starbucks and Im streaming music from my PS3 to my PSP, sooner or later, i'll be able to copy these songs and videos from my PS3, so dont complain fanboys. should make a psp and ps3 bundle and sell it... i would buy it... ps3 60gb (w basic accs.) + psp 2gb mem (w basic accs.) = $799 increased sales for both consoles.. needs to get rolling why they dont have psp ps3 co op is beyond me the psp has potential but unless they start playin up the connectivity they need to have one time free demos, a large greatest hits catalog, more game sharing, official homebrew application support (i saw a guy control his car wit a psp sony needs to be knockin at his door!) and ps3 games that have psp controlable sidekick (how tight would that be). the price drop will sell the system these features would sell sony to a larger market as the psp is more visible than the ps3. i dont know maybe im wrong, i might the only one who wants these features. hating appear to be really stupid like DonutTrooper's comment. He even added the word 'seriously'. What's happening to the people here in Gamespot?

The former covers a situation that could potentially have led to the execution of arbitrary code, but it seems there are no known exploits so far. The latter is a script injection vulnerability.

Atlantis returns to pad Two months after rolling off the launch pad to seek repairs to the hail-damaged external fuel tank, space shuttle Atlantis returns to pad 39A for mission STS-117. Cosmonauts take spacewalk outside space station MISSION CONTROL STATUS REPORT Posted: May 30, 2007 Two International Space Station cosmonauts stepped outside Wednesday for a 5-hour, 25-minute spacewalk, installing Service Module Debris Protection panels and rerouting a Global Positioning System antenna cable. Wearing Russian Orlan spacesuits, Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and Flight Engineer Oleg Kotov began their spacewalk from the Russian Pirs airlock at 3:05 p.m. EDT. The spacewalk was scheduled to begin at 2:20 p.m., but was delayed due to time required to troubleshoot a communications problem. First, the cosmonauts moved to the Strela 2, one of the hand-operated, telescoping cranes at the base of Pirs. They attached an extension to the Strela boom, increasing its reach from 45 to 60 feet. With Kotov on the end of the extension, Yurchikhin extended the boom to a point over Pressurized Mating Adapter 3, or PMA-3, on the Unity connecting node. Once in place, Yurchikhin, with guidance from Kotov, maneuvered the Strela end effector to a grapple fixture on an adapter stowage rack. The adapter is attached to PMA-3 and held three bundles of 17 debris panels. The assembly is dubbed the "Christmas Tree." Once the Christmas Tree was attached to the Strela and released from PMA-3, Yurchikhin moved it and Kotov back to the small diameter of the Zvezda Module. Yurchikhin joined Kotov there, and together they secured it to a grapple fixture on Zvezda. Next, they left the debris panel task and moved aft onto Zvezda's large conical section. There they rerouted a cable for a Global Positioning System to be used for future rendezvous operations with the European Automated Transfer Vehicle. The ATV is an unpiloted cargo carrier with almost twice the capacity of the Progress cargo craft. It is scheduled to make its first launch later this year. Once that task was completed, the cosmonauts moved back to the Christmas Tree on the forward end of Zvezda, where they removed and opened one of the three bundles of debris panels. That bundle held five panels. The aluminum panels vary in size but are about an inch thick. They typically measure about 2 by 3 feet and weigh 15 to 20 pounds. Yurchikhin and Kotov installed the five panels on Zvezda's forward section, the area between Zvezda's large and small diameters. After the installation task, the spacewalkers moved back to Pirs and into the airlock. Hatch closure marking the end of the spacewalk was at 8:30 p.m. EDT. This was the first spacewalk for Yurchikhin and Kotov. On their second, scheduled for June 6, the remaining 12 debris panels will be installed on Zvezda. Additionally, the cosmonauts also will install a section of an Ethernet cable on the Zarya module and a Russian experiment called Biorisk on Pirs. The three bundles and their adapter were delivered by space shuttle Discovery during the STS-116 mission in December 2006 and attached to PMA-3 by spacewalkers Bob Curbeam and Sunita Williams. Williams, an Expedition 15 crew member, remained aboard the station as the intravehicular officer for Wednesday's spacewalk, advising and keeping the spacewalkers on schedule. Six debris panels were previously installed during an August 2002 spacewalk by Expedition 5 Commander Valery Korzun and Flight Engineer Peggy Whitson. Those panels were delivered to the station by space shuttle Endeavour during the STS-111 mission in June 2002. This is the official astronaut patch of space shuttle Endeavour's STS-118 mission to the International Space Station.

Apple launched iTunes Plus with a menu of EMI Group music including songs from Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, Frank Sinatra, John Coltrane, Pink Floyd, and Paul McCartney. Songs cost US&#036;1.29 each, 30 cents more than standard iTunes offerings, but are "virtually indistinguishable from original recordings" and aren't fettered by Digital Rights Management (DRM) software that blocks copying, Apple said. "Our customers are very excited about the freedom and amazing sound quality of iTunes Plus," Apple chief executive Steve Jobs said in a release. "We expect more than half of the songs on iTunes will be offered in iTunes Plus versions by the end of this year." Jobs denounced digital rights management software in February in an open letter calling on the music recording industry to abandon the practice of insisting it be incorporated into digital music sold online. Major recording studios fired back that the safeguard is needed to prevent pirates from making myriad unauthorised copies and denying owners their due payments for music. Cupertino, California-based Apple and EMI, based in Britain, formed an alliance in April to sell DRM-free music. "This is a tremendous milestone for digital music," EMI Group chief executive Eric Nicoli said of the new iTunes offering. "Consumers are going to love listening to higher quality iTunes Plus tracks from their favourite EMI artists with no usage restrictions." The removal of DRM software means that for the first time, music bought at iTunes can be played on rival MP3 players, including Microsoft's Zune.

Add to My AOL Tip us on news! PSP 3.50 firmware available: "Remote Play" over the Internet Posted May 31st 2007 4:26AM by Just released in Japan, Sony's 3.50 firmware for the should making the global rounds soon enough. That, coupled with the latest PS3 firmware update, means you've just scored "Remote Play" functionality -- access to videos, music, and pictures on your home PS3 running -- over the Internet. In other words, you can stream media but can't actually play games remotely. The update also includes an RSS Channel Guide but we know it's the remote play you want. The new firmware should already be available via your PSP's Network Update option even though many of Sony's download sites are still pegged at version 3.40. Sony's 1.80 PS3 firmware enables 1080p upscaling for games and movies (8 days ago - 50 Comments) PSP hardware refresh coming this year, says report (14 days ago - 37 Comments) Sony announces PSP Go!Cam for PAL regions (30 days ago - 12 Comments) Sony PSP goes Champagne Gold (141 days ago - 29 Comments) Lik-Sang.com shut down by Sony lawsuits (219 days ago - 113 Comments) Subscribe to these comments (Page 1 of 1) May 31st 2007 4:31AM The headline says PSP 1.80 firmware... should be PS3... May 31st 2007 4:34AM meh, it's actually supposed to read 3.50. Thanks. View Comment in Thread May 31st 2007 5:49AM DarkAlex's OE in 3... 2... 1... May 31st 2007 7:25AM Now someone has to incorporate RemotePlay into MythTV May 31st 2007 7:36AM I'm downloading it now... in the US. May 31st 2007 7:40AM Wow, finally someone on the Engadget team who can spell Internet right. May 31st 2007 8:08AM I don't understand this. Does your PS3 have to remain ON and sucking power all the time in case you may want to access a few short videos? Why not upload them to Youtube instead? Then you'll be able to access them from anything, and not just a PSP and you won't have to leave your PS3 on all the time. May 31st 2007 8:19AM Can a PSP watch videos on YOUTUBE? View Comment in Thread May 31st 2007 8:41AM im still waiting to see if Joost would work on psp!!! May 31st 2007 8:57AM Kamalot: YouTube does not work on my psp... I won't be accessing a few short videos, my brother has a psp and lives 100 miles away, this way he can view files i upload on my ps3, i.e family home videos and more. He can also check out files on my pc through the media server. I'm not bothered about playing ps3 games on the psp, if it could do that.. i'd be worried about how i supposedly bought "advanced technology" when the psp can render the games. By the way.. downloaded it and it works great! May 31st 2007 9:39AM So you can access your media server as well from your PSP through the PS3? Awesome. View Comment in Thread May 31st 2007 9:41AM I wouldn't need to render the graphics, it would just stream the video. Like when you watch an animated movie like "Toy Story", you aren't actually rendering the graphics. May 31st 2007 10:03AM Awesome! Can't wait to get home and fire my PSP up. The promise of this type of functionality was one of the reasons I bought my PSP and PS3. How cool is it to be able to pull up family photos, home movies, and music from a world away. May 31st 2007 10:45AM The PS3 and PSP shared remote play capabilities since the last update. The only difference I noticed with 1.8 is that my PSP connected on the first try as opposed to the second. May 31st 2007 10:57AM Got mine to work installing TVersity & ffmpeg on my PC. Xvid movies on PC -> PS3 -> internet -> on my PSP via WiFi May 31st 2007 11:24AM Downloaded it and it works GREAT, nice little update. Now what they need to do is add "Wake on Lan" and sleep mode to the PS3. This way I can put my PS3 to sleep and it wakes up when I connect to it with my PSP. May 31st 2007 11:47AM Wake On LAN and auto sleep mode were supposed to be included with the release. I take it they weren't? Man, I wish I wasn't at work right now...

As was the case when Dell opted for AMD, it's big industry news anytime a major PC manufacturers diverges from an Intel-only strategy. For AMD, the big challenge remains making such market advances stick, as opposed to the two-steps forward, one-step backwards dance it's been doing for the past few years. First the specific news, and it's pretty succinct: Toshiba will launch three Satellite laptops using AMD's dual-core mobile Turion 64 X2 processor and AMD's M690 core-logic chipset. The notebooks will hit first in the United States and Europe. More interesting is the timing of this announcement. It seems to cement the perception that AMD is about to rebound from its recent bout of bad news. As VARBusiness's Shelley Solheim explains in her fine piece, AMD Attempts To Rebound From Its Short Circuit , the scrappy chipmaker is reeling from a big financial loss earlier this year as well as a drop in its market share. Mostly, AMD has been hurt by a . After several years of missteps, Intel CEO Paul Otellini has gotten the company back on track. Intel's Core 2 Duo line successful beat back AMD's early lead in dual-core technology. On the quad-core front, Intel was ahead of AMD. Now, Intel is expected to be first with 45-nm chip technology. Still, AMD has got a potent quad-core architecture of its own in the works, in the form of its upcoming Phenom desktop quad and "Barcelona" server processor. Since 2003, when AMD released its AMD64 architecture, and then the associated Opteron and Athlon processor families, the question has never been about the company's technology. Instead, it's about the survival of a smaller company in the face of an increasingly competitive business, against a far larger rival. Intel's sheer heft gives it the ability to ride out tough business environments and the occasional technological misstep. AMD doesn't have such luxuries. How the quad-core race and the shift to 45-nm processes play out will ultimately have more to say about the long-term fate of AMD than today's Toshiba news, however welcome that may be. &laquo; The Walrus Bucket Internet Meme, Seriously Microsoft Cancels PDC...

Now the search giant wants to actively recruit the geek elite of software programmers. On Thursday, the company will host its first , attracting 5,000 people to 10 locations around the world, including the San Jose Convention Center in California. The conference is part of a company goal is to cultivate a better relationship with programmers, particularly those on the cutting edge of , a relatively new style of application development that combines information from different Web sites. In conjunction with the conference, the company on Wednesday announced , a Web browser plug-in that allows Web developers to add offline access to Web applications. Google Gears is part of the company's strategy to in order to make Web applications more capable--a goal that it is taking substantial steps to achieve, particularly for a company whose primary business is online search. The company employs some of the key engineers in open-source software projects, including Linux kernel contributor Andrew Morton, and gives outside developers access to its services, often for free. Employees even write , released with liberal copyright and usage terms, to make the lives of Web developers easier. Although not always obvious, these programs feed into its overall business strategy. From Google's point of view, the more good Web applications, the better. "If the apps that show up in Google search results are more dynamic and more appealing, people will do more searches and be on the Web more," said Bret Taylor, group product manager for Google's developer products. "Because the Web is Google's , we're interested in improving it as much as we can." By giving developers access to its services through application programming interfaces (APIs), Google relies on third parties to extend what it offers. An application that displays Google calendar information on a mobile phone, which is not something Google engineers had done, is apt to drive more usage of that calendar. As Web applications become more functional, developer programs have become , eBay, Microsoft and , which itself first hosted a Hack Day for developers last fall. An active "ecosystem," or network, of partners creating linked services drives traffic--and revenue--to the hosting site while extending their offerings. Take our building blocks, please During the Developer Day keynote speeches, Google executives will describe how the company's developer program is organized to promote creation of mashups. In addition to California, conferences are being held in London; Paris; Madrid; Moscow; Sydney; Beijing; Yokyo; Sao Paolo, Brazil; and Hamburg, Germany. They will outline the two types of "building block" services the company intends to release: those that extend Google services and those that developers can use as part of their own applications. For example, Google Maps is a popular component for building completely new applications that plot information from one source, such as customers or hiking locations, on a Web map. Meanwhile, the Google Gadgets API lets third parties build mini-applications that reside within--and enhance--the Google home page or Google Desktop. "These developers are generating a just huge amount of traffic for their own services by developing these gadgets," Blake said. "In return, though, Google's personalized home page is only good because of the outside developers who make it good." Similarly, tools like Google Gears, available as open source, enhance Ajax development and encourage people to use the browser as the center point of computing, Blake said. Its goal is to make Ajax style development, which doesn't require proprietary plug-ins like Flash or Silverlight, as capable as possible, he said. Open source plays a big role at Google and its developer program. Chris DiBona, the open-source programs manager at Google, will deliver talks at the London edition of Developer Day where he plans to discuss the Google's activities in open source. Google is a high-profile user of several open-source products, including a variant of Linux used in its Engineers participate in open-source projects for products they use, but beyond that, Google wants to promote the underlying ethic of open source, DiBona said. "One of the reasons that I think open source is popular as it is is because it gives the customer, the developer, leverage again. They're not held hostage and not being locked in," he said. "We want to express that kind of idealism through our interfaces and open-source software has shown us the way to do that." As Google releases more APIs for its products, it will try to make them "as open as possible" by providing documentation and technical specifications for protocols, as it did with Sitemap protocol, which makes sites easier for search engines to crawl. Being as open as possible with development technology helps promote creation of good applications and a positive end-user experience on the Web, DiBona said. Adopting open-source practices with its developer products like Google Gears and APIs also allows Google to upgrade more rapidly and, as a company, keep moving fast, DiBona said. Changes in APIs can break mashup applications; an open-source "ethic" allows the company to make upgrades, he argued. In theory, other companies could serve customers who wanted to stick with older versions of Google APIs, he said. More importantly, the ability to upgrade quickly means "we're constantly trying to sell the upgrade...One of the things we really don't want to do is we don't want to slow down Google," DiBona said.

Port - Family News Story - KIRO Seattle Make KIROTV.com Your Homepage A humpback mother and cafe whales surface in Port of Sacramento, West Sacramento, Calif. Thousands Watch Whales Depart Calif. Port Whales Following 2 Tugboats, Officials Say POSTED: 5:02 pm PDT May 20, 2007 UPDATED: 1:11 pm PDT May 21, 2007 WEST SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Hundreds of people lining the shoreline around the Port of Sacramento Sunday for the most popular show in town -- watching two wayward humpback whales circle the port -- had a nice surprise on Sunday afternoon. The whales began following two tugboats that are headed out of the port and toward the Pacific Ocean. As of Sunday afternoon, the whales had moved about five miles closer to the ocean. The California Highway Patrol urged people to stay away from the area where the whales had been circling, but for a sixth day in a row, thousands showed up. About 10,000 people have turned out thus far to watch the whales, officials said. The CHP recommended if people do drive to Sacramento, they should bring water and a lot of patience due to the big crowds. Scientists have been planning to resume efforts Tuesday to lure the pair back to the Pacific Ocean by using dozens of boats and noises of pipes banging underwater to corral the whales back toward the ocean. Lt. Gov. John Garamendi said Friday at a news conference he was naming the whales Delta and Dawn, after the Helen Reddy song. Garamendi said the name Delta came from the body of water the whales are lost in and Dawn because it brings in a new day. On Friday, for the second straight day, a marine mammal rescue crew aboard a Coast Guard cutter played recorded sounds of other humpbacks feeding to the mother whale and calf stranded at the Port of Sacramento, where the two hit a dead-end after traveling 90 miles through San Francisco Bay and up the Sacramento River. The whales were not responding to the sounds, but a similar recording procedure worked in 1985 with a humpback nicknamed Humphrey, which swam in the delta for nearly a month before returning to the Pacific. However, biologists said the situation facing them near Sacramento is more complicated. It involves a mother and calf, rather than a single whale, that are much farther into the delta than Humphrey was. The injuries add another dimension, as scientists say they do not know how the wounds might affect the whales' behavior. "It's brand-new territory. It's not like we're applying something we have a lot of experience with in the past. It's essentially an experiment," said Pieter Folkens, a biologist with the Alaska Whale Foundation who was part of the rescue effort. "We really can't have high expectations of a positive outcome. We're certainly doing our best." Meanwhile, the rescue efforts are taking place inside a very industrial port, where business operations continue. "The current vessel in port now is the Jin Quan, unloading 31,000 tons of bulk cement. They're scheduled to complete operations on Tuesday at which time they'd like to depart," Mike Luken with the Port of Sacramento said. There is another ship scheduled to come in that same day, which gives all the more reason why rescuers are hoping their sound experiments will be successful. "We want to be as careful and as cautionary as possible because we really do not want to stress the mother or calf in any way because they are compromised by the injuries." Biologists hope to get the whales back into the ocean, where food is more plentiful and the salt water can heal their cuts, apparently inflicted by a boat propeller when the mammals were in the river. The failure of attempts to use whale sounds could be related to the recordings used. They were of Alaskan whales that might be part of a different pod than the one the mother and calf belong to. "This is a humpback probably from a different population, probably the Mexico-California population," Folkens said. "So it's kind of like speaking Chinese to somebody from Boston, but at least you recognize that it might be another member of the same species." The good news on Friday was that biologists did not detect any significant changes in their health from a day earlier, Gulland said. "Both mother and calf are still swimming and breathing and surfacing at similar rates as they were over the past few days," she said. Even if the recordings eventually work, scientists said it could take anywhere from several days to several weeks to lure the whales back to the bay.

I&#8217;ll give you the highlights of the webcast. Jeff Hawkins, founder of Palm talked at length about the overall focus of the company. 15 years ago they started Palm with the idea that the future was in mobile computing. They wanted to build a device that could do many of the same functions that a desktop or laptop computer could do, but small enough to fit into your pocket. They started off small by finding a market to which they could appeal. They found that niche with the Palm Pilot as a mobile organizer. Their thought was that they could appeal to a market, then let their product grow. The Palm Pilot eventually evolved into the Treo which incorporated a phone into the organizer, and let you do more of the basic computing functions. The Foleo represents the next step Palm is taking to bring the computer down to a mobile size. Again they&#8217;ve decided to cater to a specific crowd. They are targeting users that are looking for mobile mail and web browsing, but want a larger screen and a full-size keyboard. But there is plenty of room for the Foleo to grow into much more than just an email machine. The biggest features of the Foleo are the small size, full keyboard and instant-on technology. The device is only as wide as the keyboard itself to allow for the smallest possible size. This allows for a 10â screen which at a resolution of 1024 x 600 should be more than adequate for use. It has built-in WiFi and Bluetooth to keep you connected to your phone and the internet. Even with WiFi turned on, you should be able to use it for 5 hours without needing to recharge it. What really sets this apart from other mobile solutions is the instant-on function. This is not a suspended state or a sleep mode, in fact the Foleo has only two modes: on and off. So every time you press the power button, it will instantly turn on or off, no waiting. You don&#8217;t have to worry about saving what you&#8217;re doing, you can just shut the lid and go. Next time you press the power button it will be exactly where it was when you closed it. The device looks very sleek when closed, you only have ports on one side, all three of the other sides are smooth, you&#8217;ll only see the word Palm on the top of the case, otherwise it is very smooth all around. As for the ports you will see the VGA port, a USB port, an SD slot for expansion, a headphone jack and a place to plug in the power adapter. The Foleo is Linux-based, so you have the option to switch to the terminal at any time. This also means that the software is open-source and they are encouraging people to write their own software for it. They will be making the full SDK available at launch. They feel that if you give users all of the tools, they will surprise you will cool stuff. For the web browser they have chosen to use Opera, and Versamail and Pocket Outlook will be used for email. You can view flash videos, but unfortunately you won&#8217;t be able to see YouTube videos at this time. He did mention that they are currently working on support for them. You will also be able to open and edit Word and Excel documents on it, as well as view PDF files and PowerPoint presentations. Setup is a breeze, it&#8217;s only a four-step process. You pretty much just select the model of phone you have and what carrier you use, then it starts syncing your files. At this time it only syncs your email, attachments, folders and contacts, but support for other files can be added in the future. When asked what phones the Foleo supports he stated that out of the box the Treo line will work, as will most Windows Mobile phones, though he did warn that they have not had the opportunity to test all Windows Mobile phones on the market. He also included that they hope to include support for other platforms including RIM and Symbian and if Apple were to open up the phone to 3rd-party applications they would make it compatible with the iPhone as well. If you haven&#8217;t heard already, Steve Jobs announced today that they would in fact allow 3rd party apps to work in the future. So we should be able to assume that it will be able to work with the iPhone at some point. At the end of the broadcast he took a few questions, most of the information I&#8217;ve already covered, but an interesting point that was discussed is security. You can password protect the Foleo, however, it diminishes the instant-on feature. A feature that he touched briefly on was using your phone as a key, so that as long as your phone is within range of a Bluetooth connection, you wouldn&#8217;t need a password, otherwise you would. Now that is cool. One of the best questions was why I would want a Foleo rather than a laptop? Several times during the webcast Hawkins said that the Foleo is not a laptop replacement. It is targeted at people that want something small to check email and browse with. Right now if you want something this size to do those things you&#8217;d have to pay a hefty premium to get a full-featured laptop. You&#8217;ll only pay $499 for the Foleo after a $100 rebate, that&#8217;s cheap. He then went on to state that over time it may evolve into something that is more of a laptop replacement, but for now that&#8217;s not what they are aiming for. Neat, can the Folio connect to the internet via the bluetooth connection to your cell phone? This would give the user greater ability to be on-line anywhere a phone works. It&#8217;s the price MS&#8217; Origami couldn&#8217;t hack &#8212; sans touchscreen or tablet wow factors, but with the form factor and the connectivity, with some less convergence, but on the whole: so much more marketable, so much more practical. On balance this could support a lot of mobile productivity formerly chained to bloated or otherwise crippled Windows devices. It&#8217;s a flipstart, it&#8217;s a smartphone, I can barely type on it and its battery is running out. MS? next offers a $5,000 to $10,000 touchscreen table? Push the boundaries (I write from a tablet pc) but be practical. This could be it. Nice review too, btw. BG That&#8217;s a load of crock; Palm started up because Newtons were too expensive. And the more I look at this thing, the more I see a Psion Series 5mx, copied by someone who couldn&#8217;t figure out the clever Psion hinges. And by not including Symbian (oh, the irony!) on startup, he shrewdly reduced the Fooleo&#8217;s potential market share by three quarters. Please beware about quality. I have used Palm since Palm III. This one works. Palm m515 works. Palm Tungsten died on me after 1.5 years. Palm TX purchased in April 2007 died in 2 days. Second Palm TX purchased in April 2007 died at the end of May 2007. I refuse to send my Palms to the factory for repairing because I have sensitive information on them. It is impossible to turn them on. It is impossible to perform hard reset. Palm&#8217;s policy and technology(?) does not permit to remove memory. Amazon reimbursed me for the the first TX when I explained the situation. (Please notice how good the customer support can be!) I try now to get similar resolution with the Corporate Headquarters of Palm. If they will be cooperative, I let you know. However, so far I have 3 dead bricks. I was surprised that Palm did not permit to remove flash memory. More than that, memory must be removable on all modern PDA. At that time, by analogy with blue screen of death for Windows, I suggest black screen of death for Palm. If Foleo has no memory, if this is just a convenient window to the Internet, if I can use it to operate a remote computer, multiple Google applications, print or download files through other media, that may be cool. At least they will be able to repair this device after it breaks. Foleo is DOA. Do you realize they introduced the LifeDrive almost exactly 2 years ago. I have one. I am steamed that it&#8217;s not even supported any longer. I too have a dead Tungsten. I&#8217;m pretty sure Palm will follow in the footsteps of its products.

The May 30th spacewalk is being shown live on The hatch on the Russian Pirs docking compartment was opened at 3:05 p.m. EDT., about 45 minutes later than scheduled. A few problems occurred in the preparations for the spacewalk. U.S. flight engineer Sunita Williams, who is not one of the spacewalkers, worked on some of these problems. She is advising and helping with the activities of her two fellow space travelers. She is officially called the intravehicular officer for the event. Yuchikhin will be wearing a Russian Orlan spacesuit with red stripes (designated EV1) and Kotov will wear the same type of Russian suit but with blue stripes (designated EV2). Seventeen aluminum protective panels were left outside of the Space Station in an adaptive assembly nicknamed the &ldquo;Christmas tree&rdquo;. They are officially called the Service Module Debris Protection (SMDP) panels. The SMDP panels will be installed on the Zvezda Service Module (ZSM). The panels are about 2 feet by 3 feet in dimensions and weight (on Earth) about 20 pounds. They will help protect the ISS from small- and medium-sized space debris, such as natural occurring micro-meteoroids and artificially made pieces from launch vehicles. As of 5:22 p.m. CDT, the spacewalking cosmonauts have just repaired a GPS (global positioning system) navigation antenna that was broken. The GPS antenna will be used with the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), an unmanned cargo vehicle scheduled to arrive for its maiden visit to the International Space Station later in 2007. During their spacewalks, the two cosmonauts will also place canisters containing biological experiments from the Earth outside the Space Station. The future June 6th spacewalk, which begins at about 10:30 a.m., will also be shown live on beginning at 10 a.m. EDT.

The announcement was made by John Hanke, Google's director for Maps, Earth and Local, on the Google corporate blog. Terms of the deal were not announced. "We've been working with Panoramio for some time -- its photos have been a default layer in Google Earth since the beginning of the year," Hanke said. "This layer will remain in place as our teams work together toward further integrating this amazing content, generated by many, into our mapping technologies." 's key technology is its ability to allow users to "geolocate" pictures that they took, allowing them to position them on a map. In this case, the default map that the company has used has been Google Maps. The site also allows users to store and organize their pictures, similar to many other photo-sharing sites on the Web. For that reason, Google said the company was as interested in Panoramio's technology as it was its user base. "The acquisition of Panoramio will incorporate that website, its underlying technology, its content, developers, and user community into the Google Geo product mix," according to a Q&A posted to the Google site. "Panoramio will add interesting, useful content to Google products and will bolster Google's engineering and technical resources.

"Although the integration is already in place and functioning, we believed a deeper relationship would add value to the Panoramio experience for our users," the Google Q&A said, apparently attributing the comment to Panoramio executives. Passwords, under information, and other details will remain intact and unchanged throughout the transition, the companies said. Users will also have an option to opt out of the merger, although doing so will delete their content and user information from the Panoramio site. the acquisition of GreenBorder , which it will use to enhance its security offerings.

In an article published in BusinessWeek, Zemlin states that Microsoft is engaging in a scare campaign against all those potential users wanting to shift from Windows to Linux operating system. "Let's face it: If you were making $1 billion per month, what would you do? Perhaps engage in rhetoric and hyperbole to generate some old-fashioned FUD [Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt]? Just looking at the numbers, it's easy to see that even if the scare campaign merely delays a customer's migration from Windows to Linux by a single day, Microsoft is $34 million dollars better off", Zemlin wrote. Meanwhile Novell finally filed the details of its controversial agreement with Microsoft, which supports Novell CEO Ron Hovsepian's claims that his company never agreed to Microsoft's view that Linux violated Microsoft's patents. Novell was expected to file the details with the SEC last July. However the company delayed the filing in order to conduct internal examinations of the options available. The agreement also does not provide any proof that Linux is infringing any of the 45 patents of Microsoft as claimed by the company. In fact Novell specifically inserted a disclaimer in which it states that it does not agree that Linux is guilty of infringing Microsoft's patents. "Nothing in this agreement shall imply, or be construed as an admission or acknowledgement by a party, that any patents of the other party are infringed, valid or enforceable", the disclaimer read. As for Microsoft's threats that it will be suing users of Linux unless they pay some royalties, Richard Fontana, counsel for the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC), believes that the company can find itself very restricted to do so. "Microsoft lawyers who helped craft the MS-Novell deal appear to have overlooked the fact that, by procuring the distribution of lots of free software under GPL Version 2, among other licenses, Microsoft has already lost some of its power to assert patents against subsequent distributors and users of that software", Fontana said.

Launching initially with songs from music company EMI Group PLC, iTunes Plus features tracks that are free of digital rights management, or DRM, technology _ copy-protection software that limits where songs or movies can be played and distributed. The unrestricted content means some songs purchased from iTunes will work for the first time directly on portable players other than Apple's iPod, including Microsoft Corp.'s Zune. The inaugural batch of iTunes Plus songs includes music from Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, Norah Jones, Frank Sinatra, Pink Floyd and more than a dozen of Paul McCartney's classic albums. The DRM-free tracks feature a higher sound quality and cost $1.29 apiece _ 30 cents more than the usual 99-cent price of other, copy-protected songs at the market-leading online music store. If available, users can upgrade existing purchases to DRM-free versions for 30 cents a song or $3 for most albums, Apple said. London-based EMI, the world's third-largest music company by sales, and Cupertino-based Apple announced their partnership in April to deliver the industry's first major offering of DRM-free songs, sharing a vision of what both companies say their consumers want: flexibility and CD-audio quality. Other smaller online music vendors, such as eMusic.com, already offer songs without DRM, but the selections have been limited to mostly content from independent labels. Barney Wragg, the global head of digital music at EMI, said the iTunes Plus launch capped six months of work to convert most all of the company's digital catalog into a DRM-free format. "Our customers told us two things deterred them from buying digital," Wragg said. "They weren't 100 percent confident that the songs they'd purchase could play on their devices, and they wanted something closer to CD quality." Earlier this year, Apple CEO Steve Jobs called on the world's four major record companies to start selling songs online without copy-protection software. "We definitely think it's the right thing to do," Eddy Cue, Apple's vice president of iTunes, said Wednesday. "In this case, EMI's a leader and we think others will follow." In a statement Wednesday, Jobs reiterated that Apple expects that more than half of the 5 million songs on iTunes will feature a DRM-free version by the end of the year. In the meantime, Apple's iTunes Store will continue to offer songs in the same copy-protected format as today at 99 cents per download and encoded at 128 kilobits per second. The iTunes Plus versions are encoded at 256 kbps, which Apple says makes the audio quality on par with original recordings. Apple also will continue to encode its songs _ including EMI's DRM-free content _ in the AAC audio format, which could force some users to go through an extra step of converting tunes into a version that would be compatible with their players. Some gadgets don't support AAC, including SanDisk's newest Sansa Connect or Samsung Electronics Co.'s YP-K3, but industry analyst Susan Kevorkian of the IDC market research company expects support for AAC will widen following Apple's move this week. Amazon.com Inc., by comparison, said it plans to sell songs online later this year in the DRM-free MP3 format _ the popular unrestricted audio standard that is supported by virtually every device, including Apple's best-selling iPod. The next generation of digital music will be untethered from usage restrictions, Kevorkian predicts. It's something major music labels _ other than just EMI _ will have to do if they want to combat the industry's years long decline of music CD sales, she said. "They absolutely have to reach the Internet to drive music sales, and part of that is to remove the hurdle that comes with the lack of interoperability," Kevorkian said. Other major music labels _ Sony BMG Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Music _ have all experimented with limited amounts of unprotected content online but have yet to make as aggressive a move as EMI. Representatives of Warner and Sony BMG declined to comment Wednesday about the iTunes Plus offering or their own plans around DRM technology. Universal did not return a call for comment. Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at JupiterResearch, said any worries the music companies have over increased piracy from DRM-free downloads are overblown. "CDs are all sold without copy protection already, so these (unrestricted) digital files are not going to change the piracy story," he said. "People who aren't going to pay for things aren't going to pay for things, and DRM just adds an unnecessary layer of complexity here for people who do embrace this medium and have already bought billions of songs on iTunes." Shares of Apple closed at $118.77, up $4.42, or nearly 4 percent, and gained another 65 cents in extended trading. In a separate announcement after the stock market closed, Apple said it will soon introduce direct access to YouTube videos from its Apple TV set-top-box device. It also announced a beefier, 160-gigabyte Apple TV model that will be available starting Thursday for $399. ChoicePoint Settles With 44 States RGM Reports 5.2 Pct Stake in Cascade N.A.

The company is thriving in markets around the world. The Wii was the top-selling console system in Canada, the Nintendo DS handheld was the top-selling portable gaming system, and Nintendo held the top four spots for games (Pokemon Diamond Version DS, Pokemon Pearl Version DS, Wii Play, and Super Paper Mario for Wii) for the period of April 8 to May 5, according to the latest Canadian figures released by independent market researchers NPD Group Inc. Nintendo boasted the same achievements in the United States while in France the 15 top-selling games are all for Nintendo systems. Japanese video game maker Nintendo Co's senior managing director and "Mario" creator Shigeru Miyamoto demonstrates the company's new Wii game console controller next to president Satoru Iwata during a news conference in Tokyo. Email to a friend "We're ecstatic over the explosive appeal of Wii and Nintendo DS," said vice president and general manager of Nintendo of Canada Ron Bertram. At the November 2006 launch of the Wii in Toronto, Bertram anticipated good things for the console and hoped for "a strong second place" showing. The actual success is beyond anyone's expectations. In less than five months since introduction, the company has sold six million Wii systems globally and nearly 29 million Wii games. The console has taken a step toward becoming a cultural phenomenon. "Wii is selling out everything we put into the marketplace," said Reggie Fils-Aime, president and CEO of Nintendo of America, speaking at a conference in Seattle on May 22 to announce sales achievements and upcoming games for the company. Sony's PS3, which launched about the same time as the Wii, has sold just 1.84 million units worldwide, while Microsoft has sold more than 10 million Xbox 360 consoles worldwide. The 360, launched in November 2005, had a year head-start over the others. Nintendo now expects to have sold 14 million Wiis by the end of its first fiscal year, March 2008, and has ramped up production to meet the demand. In comparison, about 22 million GameCubes have been sold since its launch in November 2001. Sony's PS2, which launched in October 2000, has sold more than 106 million units around the world but there is now debate over whether Sony can maintain its dominance over the industry. The reason for Nintendo's rise is its approach to new consumers and giving them something different, said Fils-Aime. With its innovative motion-sensing controller, Wii gamers get as close to the action as possible. Players swing the controller like a baseball bat or golf club, leap around their living rooms to make a backhand return in tennis, jab madly away at the air in a boxing bout, and point it at the screen to aim their weapons. Sitting on the couch and pressing buttons just doesn't cut it anymore. The Wii remote controller is also simple to use. It's based more on gestures than button combinations, so there are very few gadgets on it, making it less intimidating to people who've never played games before. Nintendo has also taken aim at non-gamers with titles that veer away from the shooters and racers that appeal to males aged 18 to 35. John Mayer acts out a bizarre ...

Earth will be familiar with the small blue and white compass icons dotted all over the map that open up a photo of a specific location when clicked on. The Panoramio layer of location-tagged photos was added to Google's virtual globe program as a default layer, together with the Wikipedia layer at the beginning of 2007. Both layers are among the most popular layers of Panoramio is a community website whereby digital photographers can geolocate, store and organise their photographs. Earlier in 2007 Panoramio announced that the number of georeferenced photos in its database had hit the one million mark. This rapid expanse of its database was made possible through a growing community of users continually uploading photos to the site and tagging them with their geographical location. While it is free for users to keep their photos on the Panoramio website, photographers receive no payment for the use of their photos on applications like Earth. Although the majority of photos submitted are taken by amateur photographers, many show a very high standard. Photographers keep full copyright of their work, but not every uploaded photo automatically shows up on Earth. Photos are uploaded to Earth on a monthly basis, with photos being filtered by Panoramio, as well as by has paid for Panoramio has not yet been revealed. While the terms of the acquisition are still being negotiated, Panoramio are hoping to close the acquisition in mid to late June 2007. The spring season of 2007 has been marked by Google's extraordinary spending spree, among which we saw the acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick , video conferencing software firm Marratech AB, feed management provider Feedburner and security software company Greenborder. Panoramio links a photo with the exact geographical location from which it was taken, a feature that's a welcome add-on to geo-mapping technologies like Maps. Apart from being used in Google's Geo product mix, it is not yet clear how Panoramio' s technology could further be integrated into - one of Google's main rivals - began to add thumbnails of Flickr images for popular domestic and international landmark searches into their main search results. With the launch of Google's universal search feature also this month, the world's leading has also started to integrate photos, along with other types of media, into its SERPs. As a result, it might not be farfetched to assume that the Panoramio technology will enable to produce more relevant pictures to geographical searches. Other possible ways in which could use the Panoramio content could be the enhancement of the street view feature in , which was rolled out only a few days ago, or the integration of new features in Google's photo management software Picasa.

RSS Feed CBS News RSS Feeds Delta And Dawn Home Free? correspondent based in Los Angeles. It's been 18 days since the mother humpback and her calf were discovered heading up the Sacramento River the wrong way. Under the terms of the Endangered Species Act, state officials are given the power and the finances to pay for rescue efforts when an animal on the list is in trouble. The mother and calf were. They were stuck in the Port of Sacramento 90 miles upstream in fresh water! They had wounds and the mother, they believed, might still be nursing her calf. Without salt water the mother couldn't feed. It could turn into a serious situation. They believed these two had wandered off their migration course from Mexico. Usually Humpbacks give birth in the warm waters between Hawaii and Mexico during the winter and then head up to Alaska for feeding time over the summer with their young in tow. So rescue workers from California Fish and Game along with several agencies decided to try and lure the whales back down stream and into the open ocean to get them back on their migration course. First they started with those weird underwater whale noises. These were whale feeding noises. After a few days of that not working, they figured out that they were maybe playing sounds of the wrong kind of whales feeding and that's why the mother and calf didn't recognize the sounds and follow them. OK; attempt number two would be herding. This was basically to band together a flotilla of boats and push them forward, not physically but just by giving them nowhere to go but in the direction the flotilla was going. This sort of worked but then the whales dove back under the flotilla when they got too close to the next bridge they needed to go under. Basically at each bridge along the river they seemed to hesitate, which makes you wonder how they passed them going up. But that's another story, I guess. So, when the flotilla didn't work, the rescuers decided to employ a flotilla with noise. If the whales were bothered by the traffic noise at bridges (which they sort of guessed they were) then maybe making noise under water would move them back down river. All of this served to move them a little then the whales would stop where they wanted and swim in circles when they wanted. Scientists more than once said "the whales will do what the whales want to do." Really? Then on Sunday, they took off and swam down river and toward the San Francisco Bay. By Monday things were looking good and by Tuesday they were in the bay speeding toward the Golden Gate Bridge and their freedom. By this time, the giant gash on the back of the mother looked like it was getting better. The scientists had been able to give both animals a shot of antibiotics. They tried to put a tracking device on the mother to follow them out to the open sea. By nightfall Tuesday, the two had slowed and were circling off Tiburon, a coastal town just three miles away from the Golden Gate Bridge. This morning we took a fishing boat out into the San Francisco Bay, and like the rescue boats, we couldn't see anything -- just fog and a calm bay. The two humpbacks now known as Delta and Dawn (named by Californias Lt. Governor for the California Delta and the "dawn" of a new day) had vanished -- it appeared this time, for good. Rescuers said if they didn't surface by the afternoon, they were pretty sure they had slipped out during the night. The tracking device had failed and no one may ever really know why or when the two made their way back to open sea waters. But most everyone is glad that they did!! All along the route back toward the ocean, Delta and Dawn had a fan club following them. Not since Humphrey, a lost male humpback did this 22 years ago, did anyone see such a sight. It took a month to lure Humphrey back to the ocean. Delta made it in just 18 days and she was a lot farther inland. Having been married 12 years, this does not surprise me. I can imagine the underwater scene now: Delta: "Anyone down here know how to get to the Golden Gate Bridge????" Humphrey: "I know exactly where I'm going. I looked at the map before I left home." 6:37 PM : May 30, 2007 Read more posts in Now you're in the public comment zone.

With apologies to Shakespeare ("As You Like It"), the newest developments in the online world make conventional mapping Web sites look oh-so-2006. Net a 'Force for Democracy' says Google's Schmidt Google Chairman Dismisses Privacy Issue Today, Google is out with Street View, a new feature built into its Google Maps section. Type in a location you're trying to find, and you'll get a map of the area, just as you have for several years. Now, click on the "Street View" button in the upper right, and a new window opens. You'll find yourself looking at a street-level, 360-degree wraparound image of the place you chose. Move your cursor around in the picture, and you'll find that you can turn, or move down the street, or zoom in on details. Major and Minor Landmarks So, for instance, type in 630 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. (even with typos), and you'll find yourself at the entrance to St. Patrick's Cathedral. Try Las Vegas Boulevard South., move around the picture a little bit, and you'll turn up just off the Strip, watching valets parking cars at the entrance to the Bellagio. "We're just trying to enhance the user experience," says Stephen Chau, a product manager for Google Maps. For now, Street View works only in five cities (New York, San Francisco, Miami, Denver and Las Vegas), but it will expand as quickly as â well, as quickly as Google can take pictures of the entire world. 'If Only I Could Remember Its Name ...' "We can see all sorts of uses," says Chau. "I just moved to a new apartment, and I used Street View to check out the neighborhood. "You can preview the location to see if the real estate listing is accurate â is it close to public transportation, and so forth. There's a sightseeing aspect to it that way." It could also be helpful, he says, if you're trying to find that great little Italian restaurant downtown whose name you forgot. If you don't know the name, you can't exactly look it up, but if you can retrace your steps, virtually, you may find it and be able to zoom in on its sign.

Entitled the Microsoft Surface, the new computer looks more like a living room coffee table, providing enough space for several family members to use the screen at the same time. Surface also aims to make the mouse and keyboard redundant as users will manipulate it using its touch screen to access files, type documents and other general PC activities. "(Microsoft's) entertainment and devices has a long history of bringing innovative product experiences to market - such as Xbox, IPTV and Zune," said E&D executive Tom Gibbons. "The new hardware and software in Surface, along with a predominant focus on the consumer experience, support the Connected Entertainment vision - making entertainment more personal, more interactive and more social." Although Microsoft has yet to explain how the new computer will utilise gaming, they did confirm it will play a key role in the company's 'Connected Entertainment' strategy. Microsoft Surface will initially be seen in hotels and other public venues at a cost of up to $10,000, but the firm has announced it plans to produce cheaper versions to sell to home users within three to five years.

Toshiba revealed that it would be shipping out AMD processors in at least 20 percent of its notebooks sold in United States and Europe. Company spokeswoman Yuko Sugahara said that Toshiba would be including AMD processors in moderate-priced standard models for both individual and corporate clients. Analysts believe that the move comes on the backdrop of intense pressure on Toshiba to compete against its rivals, Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp, both of which make use of chips produced by Intel and AMD. While the last fiscal year saw Toshiba's PC revenues increase by 14 percent, the operating margins remain below the 1 percent mark in that particular area. Sugahara said that the company decided to include AMD processors in its computers following rising "consumer demand" and "favorable terms from suppliers". Analysts see this move as a start of the end of Intel's domination in the chip market. "This could be a message that an era in which Intel took the lion's share of microprocessor profits as the king of PC chips is over. With PCs becoming commodity products, there seems to be a new way of thinking that competition should be introduced even in procurement of such core parts like processors as long as there are no major differences in product specifications", said Yoshihiro Shimada, an analyst at Macquarie Securities. Toshiba is hoping to incorporate AMD chips in some machines so as to reduce its parts cost by at least 10 percent.

Banks PETERSBURG, Ky. -- Ken Ham stood outside his $27 million Creation Museum before its official opening on Monday (May 28) and declared its mission is not just to counter evolution. He also wants to create a few Christians. "We don't just want to see people converted to creationism,'' said Ham, president of the Answers in Genesis ministry, which built the museum on a site officials say is a convenient travel distance for two-thirds of all Americans. "We do want to see people consider the claims of the Gospel, the claims of Christianity, to see people put their faith and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ.'' The latest juncture between evolutionists and creationists comes in the form of a 60,000-square-foot building whose main hall features animatronic dinosaurs and figures of young children playing near each other in a way its owners believe life really occurred some 6,000 years ago. With the slogan "Prepare to Believe,'' Ham's creation-defending ministry opened the museum on Memorial Day on 49 acres just over the Kentucky state line from Cincinnati. The museum was partially funded by three anonymous families who donated $1 million each, but 75 percent of all donations averaged around $100, officials said. Those donations built a state-of-the-art museum with vibrating seats and sprays of water in a theater that depicts Noah's flood, and extensive exhibits that claim the Grand Canyon could have formed around the time of that flood rather than millions of years ago as suggested by most scientists. A studious visitor could spend several hours in the museum, which includes a planetarium, exhibits detailing the construction of Noah's Ark and life-size sculptures of Eve handing Adam the forbidden fruit from the Garden of Eden. Two days before the official opening, a supportive crowd of hundreds of civic and business leaders and charter members -- some who paid $1,000 for a lifetime membership -- dined on shrimp and fruit kabobs after a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Critics, however, were not far away: a plane circled overhead from the group Campaign to Defend the Constitution (DEFCON) flying a banner that read, "DEFCON SAYS THOU SHALT NOT LIE.'' Atheist and scientific groups have signed petitions complaining the museum fosters "superstition'' and will confuse schoolchildren who see one view there and hear another in high school and college. "The `museum,' as it's called, is part of a campaign to deceive children and undermine scientific understanding in our country,'' said Clark Stevens, co-director of DEFCON. Russell Moore, dean of the School of Theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, disagrees. He traveled from Louisville, Ky., with his wife and four young children to the ribbon-cutting ceremony. "I want to raise children who are able to understand Darwinism and to be able to see the alternative to it,'' said Moore, a proponent of creationism. "We have a biblical text that reveals the universe as it is and I believe in raising children who understand the authority of the word of God and who also understand all of the alternatives ... and are able to make informed, educated analysis of those things.'' One room in the museum features two paleontologists -- both as sculptures and as actors in a brief video -- examining dinosaur bones. One declares them to be thousands of years old; the other says they are millions of years old. The first paleontologist appears again in the last theater presentation, Bible in hand, declaring that every word of the holy book is true. Just outside that last theater, members of a "CARE team'' are ready to answer questions about the video, which begins with the paleontologist holding the bone of an ancient animal and ends with the story of Jesus' resurrection. The team's acronym stands for Compassion, Acceptance, Respect and Encouragement, said Cecil Eggert, the museum's "creation evangelism'' director. He said the 30-member CARE team, which was trained over several weekends, will offer everything from informative pamphlets to praying with someone who has decided to become a Christian. "We know that the bottom line in all of this is to show them that the Bible is truly the word of God, but also (that) the creator God wants to have a relationship with them through his son Jesus Christ and we are here to help them in that journey,'' said Eggert, who has worked at independent Baptist churches in youth and evangelism ministries. The biblical message will extend to the gardens of the museum, which feature sculptures of Tyrannosaurus rex and herons along with waterfalls and bridges over a manmade lake. Signs will link nature to the Bible. "People who come just to the gardens are going to get the Gospel,'' said Tim Schmitt, the museum's horticulturalist. John Haught, a research professor at Georgetown University who is an expert on science and religion, said it's "not terribly surprising'' that a museum would be created to shore up creationists' arguments about the origins of life. "It's important for them to deny evolution because ... if evolution happened, then there was no original perfection,'' said Haught, a Roman Catholic who believes in evolution. "It's absolutely essential for them that there be some fall. Otherwise the whole significance of Christianity gets lost.'' For his part, Haught doesn't see much merit in the museum and expects it will cause an "impoverishment'' of both theology and religion. "It's hard for me to come up with a single reason why we should be doing this,'' said Haught. "It's theologically problematic to me, as well as scientifically problematic.'' Ham, who once was a science teacher in his native Australia, said the museum's exhibits on creation explain the basis of the Christian faith by linking the first sin by Adam to the sacrifice of the "last Adam,'' Jesus. "If you want to go and tell someone about Jesus Christ and about sin and about the need for repentance ... you really can't do it without the foundational history of Genesis,'' he said. "Without the history of Genesis, you have no basis for any Christian doctrine.'' Photo Gallery: View the Creation Museum's Exhibits Op-Ed: The Museum Will Mislead Kids FAQ: What Is Creationism?

Robert Alan Soloway is accused of using networks of compromised "zombie" computers to send out millions upon millions of spam e-mails. U.S. attorney Jeff Sullivan said the case is the first in the country in which federal prosecutors have used identity theft statutes to prosecute a spammer for taking over someone else's internet domain name. Soloway could face decades in prison, though prosecutors said they have not calculated what guideline sentencing range he might face. "He's one of the top 10 spammers in the world," said Tim Cranton, a Microsoft Corp. lawyer who is senior director of the company's Worldwide Internet Safety Programs group. "He's a huge problem for our customers. This is a very good day." ZombiesÂ are computers that have been hijacked to perform commands and functions issued to them by the attackers, often without the owners' knowledge. A U.S. federal grand jury last week returned a 35-count indictment against Soloway charging him with mail fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering. Soloway pleaded not guilty Wednesday afternoon to all charges after a judge determined thatÂ â even with four bank accounts seized by the governmentÂ â he was sufficiently well off to pay for his own lawyer. He has been living in a ritzy apartment and drives an expensive Mercedes convertible, said prosecutor Kathryn Warma. Prosecutors are seeking to have him forfeit $773,000 US they say he made from his business, Newport Internet Marketing Corp. A public defender who represented him for Wednesday's hearing declined to comment. Man accused of running network of zombies Prosecutors say Soloway used computers infected with malicious code to send out millions of junk e-mails since 2003. The computers are called "zombies" because owners typically have no idea their machines have been infected. Zombie computers are typically organized into networks called botnets, and used to distribute spam or phishing e-mails,Â as well asÂ viruses and Trojans that are used to hijack other computers. Botnet operators often rent time or bandwidth on their networks to spam e-mail marketers and phishing scam artists. He continued his activities even after Microsoft won a $7-million US civil judgment against him in 2005, and the operator of a small internet service provider in Oklahoma won a $10-million judgment, prosecutors said. The investigation began when the authoritiesÂ started receiving hundreds of complaints about Soloway, who had been featured on a list of known spammers kept by The Spamhaus Project, an international anti-spam organization. The Santa Barbara County, Calif., Department of Social Services said it was spending $1,000 a week to fight the spam it was receiving, and other businesses and individuals complained of having their reputations damaged when it appeared spam was originating from their computers. "This is not just a nuisance. This is way beyond a nuisance," Warma said. Soloway used the networks of compromised computers to send out unsolicited bulk e-mails urging people to use his internet marketing company to advertise their products, authorities said. People who clicked on a link in the e-mail were directed to his website. There, Soloway advertised his ability to send out as many as 20 million e-mail advertisements over 15 days for $495, the indictment said. Soloway remains in federal detention pending a hearing Monday. &copy; The Canadian Press, 2007 News: More spam, but less worry for computer users Feature: Online crime - Taking on zombie botnets Feature: Malware evolution - Money now the driving force behind internet threats, experts say Feature: Stock spam, the new boiler room Spammers up to new and old tricks: report Feature: Botnets - The end of the web as we know it?

Gates Shows Off 'Surface' Table Computer Computer In Table Lets Users Grab Objects Microsoft Surface Computer Doesn't Need Keyboard POSTED: 12:38 pm EDT May 30, 2007 Microsoft unveiled early Wednesday morning a new kind of computer called Surface. The coffee-table shaped computer responds to touch and bar codes attached to everyday objects. The machines got its public debut at a technology conference in Carlsbad, Calif. Surface is set to arrive in November in T-Mobile USA stores and properties owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide and Harrah's Entertainment. Surface is essentially a Windows-based PC tucked inside a table base, topped with a 30-inch touchscreen in a clear frame. Five cameras that can sense nearby objects are mounted beneath the screen. Unlike most touchscreens, Surface can respond to more than one touch at a time. Videos of the concept last year showed that people could easily drag and drop objects on the screen with their fingers, even grabbing more than one. It also allows for gestures such as squeezing fingers together to zoom in. The concept also included pressure sensitivity that could change what happens based on how hard someone presses. In the earlier demonstration, a keyboard could be projected on the screen -- and enlarged or shrunk -- to input text. Distributed by Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc.

Rescue efforts came to a close Wednesday evening after authorities in boats and helicopters spent all day searching the San Francisco Bay and beyond the Golden Gate Bridge but turned up no sign of the pair. 7:30 p.m. No new sightings by day's end Despite scouring the waters around Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco Bay, no one has seen the injured whales all day, and rescuers hope they have quietly slipped back to their ocean home. Earlier, whales were spotted near Baker Beach, but the experts now believe they were not Delta and Dawn. "We're confident that these animals have swam out to their habitat under the cover of darkness," said Scott Hill of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during a Wednesday evening news conference. Because of the high volume of people seeking information, authorities will keep the Farallones information center open for a few more days. 2:40 p.m. Suggestion number disconnected A telephone number set up so that the public could suggest ways of rescuing the Delta's two injured humpback whales was disconnected Tuesday night after a hacker changed the outgoing message to say that the creatures had been euthanized, a spokesman for U.S. Coast Guard said today. The bogus recording reportedly indicated that the massive operation ended because of a lawsuit and that the whales had been put down to end their suffering. In fact, mother and calf were last spotted Tuesday evening just east of the Golden Gate Bridge, and officials are hoping that the absence of sightings so far today means that they made it safely back home. 9:40 a.m. Air search soon under way Marine experts plan to continue searching the San Francisco Bay and beyond the Golden Gate Bridge all day, but if that turns up nothing, they will assume the whales have safely made it back to the Pacific. There has been no confirmed sighting of the whales since 8:40 p.m. Tuesday when officials saw the humpbacks at Paradise Cay near Tiburon. At a news briefing this morning, officials said a helicopter and several boats will continue to search the area. Vessels have also been posted outside the Golden Gate to look for the large mammals. "We would love to have seen them one last time to say good-bye, but if they made it home, that's what counts," said Bernadette Fees of the state Department of Fish and Game. "We'd be delighted, actually very delighted." Fees said that they will continue rescue work today, operating out of new headquarters in the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary at San Francisco's Presidio. If nothing happens today, she said they will suspend the rescue tonight, but still keep the Farallones information center open for a day or two. When asked about the whales' movements, Fees said they seem to slow down in the afternoons, but officials don't know what they do at night because they haven't been monitoring them after dark. "If we learned anything about these two, they are gonna do what they want to do when they want to do it," Fees said. She also thanked the 70 rescue workers who have been part of the operation. "They've worked together as a team and they put their heart and soul into it," she said. And, although most of the whales' major progress has happened without anyone's help, officials said the rescue experience gave them an unprecedented chance to learn more about the species. It's the first time marine mammal experts have had the opportunity to monitor the endangered whales for such a long time, Fees said, noting they've learned a lot about their general health. Scientists were unable to tag the whales with tracking devises Tuesday because the device was malfunctioning. 7:30 a.m.: Boat operations are under way As of 7:30 a.m., the whales had not been spotted since late Tuesday and rescuers were preparing to go back onto the water to continue their search. "We haven't seen 'em yet," said Carol Singleton, a whale rescue operations spokeswoman with the state's Office of Emergency Services in Sacramento. "We're waiting for a report from the CHP's helicopter, which will do a fly-over." Singleton said officials plan to hold their morning briefing at 9:15 a.m. at Vallejo's California Maritime Academy. "If they cross over, get through the Golden Gate, then we'll have a larger press conference there," she said. At 6:30 a.m., Petty Officer Dorian Jackson of the U.S. Coast Guard's Sector San Francisco said the whales are on pace. "If they continue at the pace they're going, they should hit the Golden Gate (Bridge) by noon," Jackson said. "We're going to be getting a boat under way at 8 a.m." with a complement of boats similar to the one that accompanied them yesterday, he said. Staff writer George Kelly contributed to this story.

Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, depicted in the Creation Museum. swung open its stegosaurus-guarded gates to the public Monday, and I have to say it's out of this world. For those of us raised in natural history Meccas like the American Museum in New York, the Smithsonian in Washington, or the Field in Chicago, the beautifully designed museum induces an eerie vertigo. All the familiar characters are here: T. rex, giant skeletons of triceratops and apatosaurus, a pterosaur spreading its wings above the crowd, live exhibits of birds, amphibians and reptiles, and the dripping, hooting and chirping soundtrack of the primeval forest. There are also a couple of unfamiliar faces, for a natural history museum, in the tan and finely muscled bodies of Adam and Eve. At the ribbon cutting, Ken Ham, the rugged-faced CEO and president of the nonprofit ministry that built the museum, tells an enthusiastic crowd that the Creation Museum will undo the damage done 82 years ago when Clarence Darrow put William Jennings Bryan on the stand in the famous in Dayton, Tenn. "It was the first time the Bible was ridiculed by the media in America, and that was a downward turning point for Christendom," Ham says.

People have been speculating for weeks now in both online and print media about how the two would interact with one another in their joint-interview, and just what the two powerful computing geniuses would shed light on, if anything. For those spoiling for a blood-bath, you'll be disappointed. Instead what viewers were treated to was a 90-minute long chat about the past 30 years they've worked as rivals, complete with plenty of reminiscing and laughter at their early ideas. The interview was hosted by Wall Street Journal columnist Walt Mossberg and technology reporter Kara Swisher, read on below for all the deets... For two men who have always had complete contradictory ideas on the future of technology, there was an awful lot of agreement between them regarding personal computing. Both men claimed that the PC still has a long life ahead of it, and with the internet and digital media's advances in the industry, personal computing would go from strength to strength. Gates must have had his PA google - sorry, , compliments, as he commented that "what Steve's done is quite phenomenal. He has incredible taste and elegance". Likewise, Jobs had also brushed up on his manners, and furnished Gates with accolades, including claiming that "Bill built the first software company in the industry...Bill focused on software before anyone". Oh, how Gates must have grimaced then. What is apparent, judging by the transcripts provided by both , plus the various videos floating around, is that the two industry-pioneers really do have an awful lot of respect for one another. All that's reported in the media about them being at loggerheads has now been debunked - sure, they'll always remain rivals, working in the same industry, but that doesn't mean they can't actually see eye to eye occasionally. Indeed, when asked by Kara Swisher what the greatest misunderstanding about the relationship is, Jobs jokingly replied "we've kept our marriage secret for over a decade now", later adding "relationships that are destructive don't help anybody...the era of setting apple and Microsoft up in competition is over". The two discussed at great length applications, and how much adoration Jobs has for Gmaps and external companies. We've seen in recent months Apple partnering up with other companies, for instance the iTunes give-away deal with Coca Cola all the rumours about Google apps being placed on the iPhone, so when Jobs says he admires Microsoft's ability to collaborate with other tech companies, you know he's taken a few pages out of Gates's book. "They learned how to partner with people really well, and I think if Apple could have had a little more of that in its DNA, it would have served it extremely well". When asked by Kara about further plans for next-gen communications and collaboration tools, such as Wikis, an awkward pause was met by both Jobs and Gates. Either they really haven't thought about it, or someone's got something up their sleeve. With both parties obviously facing new online rivals every day, such as Google with their free online programs, a question about whether they worry about these start-ups was inevitable. This is where the differences between the two companies are vast - Steve comments that Apple "takes a different approach...we don't know how to do maps, search, some of this new stuff...so we partner with those companies that do. It's really hard for one company to do everything". As much as it pains me, I definitely see Jobs's point, that partnering with online companies already well-established in their niches definitely works better than developing your own software. Look at Google's own attempt at online video, with Google Video, and how they eventually resigned to fate and acquired YouTube, the only direct competitor in the field. So, there may not have been any bloody spilled, and whilst there wasn't any physical affection displayed ( ! was I the one hoping for a hug?!), they get along really well obviously, and it's apparent they both admire each other's work. Gates admitted "it's been fun to work together...people come and go in this industry, it's nice when someone sticks around!" At the end of Engadget's blow-by-blow live account of the interview, Ryan Block commented that Steve Jobs appeared 'calculating, articulate, very guarded, playing his hand very close to the chest". Surprising, as I always thought Steve was fairly affable and was adopting the use of ' ' within Apple - case in point being the announcement about the iPhone months before launch. Where ol' Billy Gates was concerned, Engadget claimed he appeared "very friendly, very open, [and] surprisingly accessible". That's our Bill, sigh. Nevertheless, Steve can obviously be very smooth when he wants to be, as his parting shot was "when Bill and I first entered the industry, we were the youngest guys in the room, and now weâre the oldestâ¦ And thereâs that one line in that Beatles song, 'You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead,' and I think thatâs clearly true here".

Given its current capabilities, features, and, frankly, a handful of limitations, I made a case explaining why I'll be sitting on the sidelines and not buying an Apple TV for the time being. I did however, leave room to be convinced that my initial judgment was wrong (see BusinessWeek.com, 5/17/07, "Tuning Out Apple TV&mdash;for Now" ). Since Apple ( ) had already promised a series of changes to the device through software upgrades, I was willing to reevaluate the device as new features were added. A Hint of Things to Come On May 30, in a conversation with Walt Mossberg at the D: All Things Digital conference in Carlsbad, Calif., Apple CEO showed exactly what he has in mind for the Apple TV, and while it doesn't look like a big deal today, the implications are very interesting. After a software upgrade available in mid-June, Apple TV users will be able to watch video downloads from Google's ( Jobs described Apple TV as a "hobby," saying that Apple's three main businesses are the Mac, the iPod and the iTunes store, and soon, the iPhone. There's not much of a business yet in bridging the gap between Internet video and the TV set&mdash;Jobs ballparked the current addressable market at just hundreds of thousands of users. So for now, Apple TV remains an interesting sideshow to its existing $20 billion to $24 billion business of selling Macs, iPods, iPhones, and everything else Apple purveys. In time, it may grow into something much bigger, just as the iPod did. Hobby is an interesting choice of words, considering how important Internet video is widely expected to become in the next several years. Market research firm eMarketer reckons that ad spending in conjunction with Internet videos could grow to a $3-billion-a-year business. So when Steve Jobs calls something a hobby, I'm reminded of a professional baseball player named Bo Jackson who took up a "hobby" in 1987&mdash;playing pro football for the Oakland Raiders. Only one month into that hobby, Jackson rushed for 221 yards against the Seattle Seahawks, a rushing record for a Monday night game, and scored three touchdowns. A Record-Breaker in the Making? So if online video is to be a hobby for Apple, lets take a look at the scorecard so far. Is it off to a Jacksonian start? Internet video and YouTube are essentially synonymous, and YouTube is the biggest thing to happen to the Web in several years. In fact, in the days before Google paid $1.65 billion to buy YouTube, there was much speculation that Apple would be the one to acquire it. Meanwhile there are scores of YouTube knockoffs trying to make a go of the business. And with cheap digital camcorders and simple digital production software only getting cheaper and easier to use, the amount of video content will only increase and the quality will only improve. Some day, YouTube will carry high-definition video. Some day, HD video will be everywhere on the Web. This tie-up between Apple and Google isn't about what YouTube is today. Do you really want to watch videos of college kids mixing Diet Coke ( ) and Mentos on your TV when you have an entire season of on your TiVo ( )? Probably not. But YouTube and its ilk aren't always going to be about novelty videos passed from friend to friend via e-mail and blog postings. In time&mdash;and that time isn't far off&mdash;the Web is going to be the premier method of video distribution. Sometimes it will be free, and sometimes you'll pay for it.

At the simplest level, Google Gears is an open source developer product that will give hosted, web-based applications a local desktop home. In other words, Gears solves the problem of using a web application offline. Its key components include the ability to capture and serve up locally the resources and code that comprise a web application, such as all the images, the logic, and the look and feel.&#160; The second major piece of Gears is the ability to create a local database that web applications can access. "This is a rich database with full text search and full transactional capabilities," said Linus Upson, director of engineering at Google. The third feature gives developers the ability to use Gears to run JavaScript in a background task via the multithreading capabilities of multicore processors. With this capability, a developer can create a web-based application and a desktop version that synchronize one with the other. Without this multithreading capability, if a web application was synchronizing with the local desktop version, it would freeze the application until the synchronization was complete. Synchronization is a must-have for any application that lives on two platforms, but any delay would be unacceptable to most users. Beyond the straightforward product details, however, there are other bigger issues in play. When Brent Taylor, head of Google development, says that he would like to see "an industry-wide effort to have these capabilities standardized across all browsers," Taylor is also driving Google's stake in the ground as a leader of the software shift to web 2.0 applications, according to David Mitchell Smith, Gartner analyst. "Google keeps pushing the envelope with browser-based applications," said Smith. The question is to what extent those web applications are accepted in the enterprise. Smith said companies should not overestimate its capabilities. "What they have is a developer kit," said Smith, and every developer of every web application will have plenty of work to create a finished product. At the same time, Google is not the only company looking at ways to extend web applications to the desktop. Adobe's Apollo has a similar goal. However, while Apollo lives on the desktop and can access any local file system, Gears can access only the SQL Light database created by the application. However, the Gears API will be available in Apollo, according to Kevin Lynch, senior vice president and chief software architect at Adobe.&#160; According to Smith, Gears, like AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) before it, puts a lot of capabilities into the hands of developers of the Web, and IT needs to track web application development closely to understand where the next generation of the web is going.&#160; Traditional on-premises enterprise ISVs are also tracking web capabilities intensely to see how they can embrace the new software paradigm. For its part, Microsoft will have to demonstrate the continuing value of rich, client-based desktop applications, said Smith. As Smith says, web 2.0 will not grow beyond gadgets and widgets unless it can establish itself as a development platform for serious, enterprise-level applications. That it cannot do unless data can be saved securely behind the firewall, can be synchronized so that only a single version exists, and is accessible offline as well as online. Gears technology appears to be going a long way toward meeting that goal. Google Gears will be made available at . Although it is still too early to submit Gears to a standards body, according to a Google spokeswoman, Michele Turner, vice president of product management, marketing and developer relations at Adobe said Adobe will be a sponsor. back to news index Steve Jobs on Apple, Mac, iPod and iPhone YouTube lands on the Apple TV Apple sets DRM-free trap Video from Steve Jobs and Bill Gates meet-up SoundSoap Pro updated for Intel Macs WWDC: Don't forget your iPod Palm unveils its 'smartphone companion' Apple TV gets 160GB drive News Corp. buys Photobucket, Flektor Apple launches education site through iTunes Apple officially opens iTunes Plus service Fonelink improves mobile and Mac integration Maroon 5 claim iTunes sales record Apple secures QuickTime with update Apple updates iTunes for DRM-free music sales Google Maps gains street views, miniapps Google opens up Gmail to more users 20 June launch for iPhone WiebeTech debuts its tiny drive Apple TV development kit ships Finnish court rules DVD DRM 'ineffective' More Digital Lifestyle news...

With apologies to Shakespeare ("As You Like It"), the newest developments in the online world make conventional mapping Web sites look oh-so-2006. Today, Google is out with Street View, a new feature built into its Google Maps section. Type in a location you're trying to find, and you'll get a map of the area, just as you have for several years. Now, click on the "Street View" button in the upper right, and a new window opens. You'll find yourself looking at a street-level, 360-degree wraparound image of the place you chose. Move your cursor around in the picture, and you'll find that you can turn, or move down the street, or zoom in on details. Major and Minor Landmarks So, for instance, type in 630 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. (even with typos), and you'll find yourself at the entrance to St. Patrick's Cathedral. Try Las Vegas Boulevard South., move around the picture a little bit, and you'll turn up just off the Strip, watching valets parking cars at the entrance to the Bellagio. "We're just trying to enhance the user experience," says Stephen Chau, a product manager for Google Maps. For now, Street View works only in five cities (New York, San Francisco, Miami, Denver and Las Vegas), but it will expand as quickly as  well, as quickly as Google can take pictures of the entire world. 'If Only I Could Remember Its Name ...' "We can see all sorts of uses," says Chau. "I just moved to a new apartment, and I used Street View to check out the neighborhood. "You can preview the location to see if the real estate listing is accurate  is it close to public transportation, and so forth. There's a sightseeing aspect to it that way." It could also be helpful, he says, if you're trying to find that great little Italian restaurant downtown whose name you forgot. If you don't know the name, you can't exactly look it up, but if you can retrace your steps, virtually, you may find it and be able to zoom in on its sign. Google sent vans out with cameras mounted on top, plus GPS locators and computers to store the data they collected. The result was a giant database of images, which can give you panoramic views of a location, or allow you to move down the street a little and get a different view. Other firms are doing similar things, and Google is hardly the first to hit the market with its city views. Numerous real estate entrepreneurs in the United States and Europe have tried to offer such services as a way for people to check out a neighborhood before they move there. Microsoft's map search offers views in San Francisco and Seattle; Amazon tried a version but stopped. But Google, because it has such a lead in the search business, has upped the ante. It does not include advertising in the street views on its site, but it will doubtless profit by attracting more Web surfers to its site. Oh, one other address to try: 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043. Enter that one and you'll find yourself in front of Google's headquarters, the so-called Googleplex. Chau says somewhere in the imagery of the area, they've hidden a picture of the team that developed Street View. "There is a little Easter egg in the product," he says. "And now, I've told you more than I should have."

A fishing vessel, the Orion, reported the sighting to the Coast Guard at about 8 p.m., said Coast Guard Petty Officer Jonathan Cole. The sighting supports what scientists had believed all day Wednesday -- that the mother and calf had departed from San Francisco Bay and re-entered their ocean home. The apparent departure of the two humpbacks from the bay marks the end of an epic adventure that drew international attention and thrilled Northern California animal enthusiasts, many thousands of whom flocked to the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to catch a glimpse of them and wish them well. The whales had toured the delta for more than two weeks, and scientists believe the pair -- which were not seen during the daylight hours Wednesday -- had probably exited the Golden Gate on Tuesday night, leaving behind a trove of valuable data as a memento. Scientists who tracked the pair say they will need time to collate and study all the information they gathered, but that the analyses should contribute substantively to the understanding of the species. The two animals set an inland travel record for humpbacks, swimming about 90 miles through the delta and up a shipping channel to the Port of Sacramento. Throughout their sojourn that started May 13, researchers tried to both lure and drive the animals back to the ocean through a variety of means, including pipe-banging and squirting fire hoses. In the end, the whales left on their own, swimming from Rio Vista to San Francisco Bay with no apparent impetus from their would-be rescuers. One of the researchers who led the effort, John Calambokidis with the Cascadia Research Collective in Washington state, said it was learned that manmade noises can affect humpbacks somewhat, although it's unlikely the animals can be forced to swim where they don't want to go. "We had influence but not control," he said. The researchers who followed the mother and calf over the last two weeks agreed that some of the most useful information learned is related to antibiotics injected into the whales over the holiday weekend. Both animals suffered ship propeller or keel wounds around the time they entered the bay, and researchers became worried as the gashes showed signs of festering. By the time the animals had spent a week in the delta, their skin also showed signs of deteriorating due to excessive exposure to freshwater. So on Saturday, scientists injected both animals with antibiotics -- the first time humpbacks have been treated with such medicines. The researchers used a foot-long needle and calculated dosages based on what is known about large animals that live on land, said Trevor Spradlin, a marine mammal biologist with the fisheries department of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The calf received about 60 milliliters of an antibiotic known as Baytril, and its mother thrice that -- roughly 6 fluid ounces, enough to fill a brimming wine glass. By Tuesday night, the whales' skin and wounds had begun to heal; the medicine and the bay's saltwater probably played a role, scientists said. Teri Rowles, the lead veterinarian at NOAA fisheries department, said the injection method almost certainly will be used in the future to help whales, including those that suffer from injures caused by boats or fishing nets. The wayward whales presented a rare opportunity for researchers to spend several days with the same humpbacks. "What has been wonderful about this event is that we could get extremely close to the whales for an extended period of time," Spradlin said. "The marine environment is a very tough place to work, the whales seldom are close and the time you can spend with them is usually limited." Although the researchers were unable to attach a satellite tag to the mother whale, Calambokidis said he is optimistic that the humpbacks will be seen in the ocean and identified by markings on their fins and tail. When the only other humpback known to have visited the delta swam back to the ocean in 1985, the whale -- dubbed Humphrey -- was spotted at least 10 times in the ocean during a span of five years, Calambokidis said. Researchers will be "teasing" the data in coming months, comparing it with other humpback studies. With whale research, hard and fast facts are difficult to come by; everything depends on everything, Spradlin said. "With their behavior, for example, we have to take into account not only the stimulus from the rescue boats but (the whales') relationship with each other another, the time of day, currents and other factors," he said. "Then we have to correlate that with other behavioral data from humpbacks in different situations." Yet scientists may never know the answer to a key question -- why the two whales went into San Francisco Bay in the first place. "It's hard to enter the mind of a whale, hard to know what motivates them," Spradlin said. "It's plausible they came in here to escape predators because of their wounds -- or maybe they just made a wrong turn." Nevertheless, the emotional impact the whales left on residents may prove a legacy even greater than their contribution to science. "What strikes me most about this event was the enormity of compassion and concern that people evinced for these two creatures," said Stan Minasian, a naturalist with the Oceanic Society. The San Francisco environmental group advocates for the protection of marine mammals and conducts whale-watching tours. "Some people said we should let nature take its course," he said. "But we have so altered nature that only remnant populations of these great whales exist, and they deserve our utmost efforts to protect them. That's something most people instinctively recognized."

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/0-3&fd=R&url=http://australianit.news.com.au/articles/0,7204,21824769%255E15306,00.html&cid=1116814949&ei=jv1eRobJFYXoqgPDpanNDQ Palm unveils compact PC | Australian IT AEST Palm unveils compact PC Franklin Paul in New York | PALM has introduced a compact portable computer to accompany its Treo smartphone. The new "Foleo" is about the size of a hardcover book and, at 1.1kg, half the weight of other small laptop computers. It is designed to be used with a smartphone, to help business travellers better manage their email and documents by offering a 10-inch screen, full keyboard and wireless. Palm, best known for personal digital assistants (PDAs) and Treo phones, said it expected the Foleo to eventually work with rival smartphones such as Research In Motion's BlackBerry and Apple's iPhone, although it has not discussed technology-sharing agreements with those companies. Company founder Jeff Hawkins said he expected unit sales of Foleo, priced at $US599 ($729) to be smaller than Treo units sales at first. "Ultimately, it will make smartphones more successful," Mr Hawkins said. "The volume we anticipate selling of Foleo initially will be small compared to the volume of Treos. It's not going to be a driver in the short term. But it allows us to rethink how you design smartphones." The Foleo may signal a shift in focus for Palm, which dominated the market for personal digital assistants (PDAs) after it launched its original Palm Pilot in 1996. Its PDA sales dwarfed those of rivals such as Hewlett-Packard and Sony, but PDA demand dwindled early in this decade as similar features were built into cheaper mobile phones. Palm's Treo, which combines a phone with its PDA operating system, eventually became the company's signature product with shipments of 2.3 million units in the last fiscal year. Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies in San Jose, said mass appeal for the Foleo is not likely, since smartphones represented a fraction of the overall mobile phone market and only a portion of those customers would be interested in carrying a separate device. Moreover, many business travellers were resigned to carrying a smartphone and a full portable computer. "I will argue that this product is for the 'road warrior.' It's not probably for mainstream, it's more of a business tool," Mr Bajarin said. The Foleo will compete with low-cost laptop PCs. "It will hit a nerve with a certain segment and in that sense has a lot of potential," he said. With Foleo, Palm enters the burgeoning world of open source computing. Palm's device would also compete with Dell, which last week started selling Linux-based PCs. "One big unknown is what happens if the open source world decides to embrace (Foleo), as the first mobile Linux portable. It actually has potential ... if the open source world decides that this is a powerful way of expending the Linux franchise," Mr Bajarin said. Separately, Palm chief executive Ed Colligan played down speculation that the company was for sale, saying that the new product proves it is working on innovation. "We're not focused on figuring out how to sell the company," he said on the CNBC television network.

According to analyst Greg Sterling, the steady introduction of new mapping features is driven to a large extent by competition rather than by an expectation of revenue. Palm's Foleo: Measuring the Impact Feds Arrest 'Spam King' in Seattle IRS Spoof Targets Execs Through RTF CDW Accepts $7.3 Billion To Go Private Palm Foleo: A 'Smartphone Companion' According to the great British satirist Douglas Adams, the stages of a civilization can be summarized in three questions: 1. How can we eat? (Survival); 2. Why do we eat? (Inquiry); and 3. Where shall we have lunch? (Sophistication). It's the last of those questions -- the search for a good place to eat -- that is driving the most recent Web battle: the push to make online mapping services increasingly sophisticated and user-friendly. Both Google, which operates Google Maps, and , which runs Live Search Maps, announced new features on Tuesday that are designed to help users plan trips, get previews of where they are going, and, most importantly, find businesses that might be persuaded to advertise with the mapping services. Two weeks ago, Google signaled the intensity of its work in this area by launching the Google Lat Long Blog, devoted specifically to the company's work on its maps, Google Earth, its local map service, and related APIs. "Things are changing so fast," said John Hanke, the Director of Google Earth and Maps, in the blog's initial post, "we thought a blog focused on this topic would be the best way to communicate with you, both about our products and about the overall development of geo on the Web." At the Where 2.0 conference on Tuesday, Hanke rolled out two new Google developments: "Street View" and "Mapplets." The Street View feature offers map users 360 degree images of streets in various urban areas around the country. Initially, images are available for portions of the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver, and Miami, with other areas to be added later. If street level views are available for a particular area, a new button labeled "Street View" will appear on the Google map. Users can click on the image, pan in every direction, and even move forward or back, creating the illusion of walking down the street. The other feature introduced by Google, Mapplets, is designed to help developers and consumers create mini-applications that can be embedded on Google Maps to provide information or perform simple tasks. Three sample applications demonstrated by Google included real estate listings, movie times, and a distance-measurement tool. In its press release, Google said that several of its partners, including WeatherBug and Booking.com, have already created customized Mapplets. "Maps are an enormously popular application," said Greg Sterling, an Internet search analyst and founder of Sterling Market Intelligence. "They've proven to draw millions of users. In fact, Google Maps may be its most successful product, apart from search. These new features are designed to reinforce that usage."

Mapping of other cities is planned as well. Microsoft Virtual Earth gives people photo-realistic 3D bird's-eye views of buildings and topography. Last November, the company released Virtual Earth 3D in beta, along with the application programming interface and a software developer kit for people who wanted to create 3D renderings. While some terrain and buildings were also viewable at that time, the current release of New York in virtual 3D marks the first major effort by Microsoft to create an almost complete rendering of a recognizable city. Unlike Google Earth's 3D world, Microsoft's virtual world can be seen via Microsoft's Internet Explorer and in Firefox, once an add-on has been downloaded. Google Earth's 3D-mapping features are not compatible with Web browsers but rather with the application download.

The Foleo turns on and off instantly and features fast navigation, a compact and elegant design, and a battery that lasts up to 5 hours of use. SAN JOSE, Calif. - Seeking to recapture its innovative streak in mobile computing, Palm Inc. on Wednesday unveiled a laptop-like gadget with a full-size keyboard and 10-inch display to serve as a companion for smartphones. But the Palm Foleo was already garnering dismal critiques from some analysts who predicted it would do little to boost Palm's position in an increasingly competitive smartphone industry. The gadget, which will be available in the summer at a suggested price of $599 before an introductory rebate of $100, is designed to let users manage and edit their e-mails and other documents by communicating with their smartphones through a wireless Bluetooth connection. Files can be synchronized across the two devices. The Foleo has Wi-Fi, Internet-browsing capabilities and a Linux-based operating system, but it lacks a hard drive and other full functions of a computer. Analysts questioned why consumers would want to carry yet another device when they are already bombarded with computer notebooks that are getting smaller and cell phones, including the Palm Treo, that are getting smarter. "This is the most disappointing product I've seen in years," said Todd Kort, an industry analyst at Gartner Inc. research firm. "They have some longer term goals for this product in mind, but this is going to hit the market with a thud." Sunnyvale-based Palm pioneered personal digital assistants more than a decade ago and helped create the smartphone market with its Treo handsets. But more recently, the company has found itself under a tough spotlight: rumors are swirling that it could soon get acquired while users are complaining about the staleness of the Treo's chunky design. Palm's founder, Jeff Hawkins, has long envisioned that smartphones would become the most prevalent personal computer, eventually being able to do everything a desktop model can do. On Wednesday, he said the Foleo "completes the picture" of a mobile-computing system. "There are times when people need a large screen and a full-size keyboard," he said. "As smart phones get smaller, this need increases." Shares of Palm rose 42 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $16.60 on Wednesday. The stock has ranged from $13.41 to $19.50 in the past 52 weeks.

More iPhone clues and rumours Vodafone 3G passes half million mark - UPDATE Nokias N95: the real iPhone killer? - Update Right, said Fred, is SED TV dead? Vodafone customers get ninemsn TV channel - free The highly anticipated on-stage interview and chat Wednesday night with Steve Jobs, 52, and Bill Gates, 51, at the D: All Things Digital conference, moderated by Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, has finally happened. Blogged in detail by Harry McCraken at PC World , along with plenty of other reports online, the two tech titans talked of Apple and Microsoft&rsquo;s past, and their early efforts to work together, with Microsoft&rsquo;s first software for Apple being the BASIC programming language for the Apple II computer. Generous and warm to each other, there was gentle ribbing about the PCs vs Mac ads, praise for each other&rsquo;s strengths and contributions to the industry, each other&rsquo;s strategies, discussion of post-PC digital devices, tablet, touch and user interface technologies, natural interaction between man and machine, the desire for true software companies to create their own hardware, each man&rsquo;s respective legacy, talk of future projects that were still under wraps and in development, talk of teleporters and holodecks in sci-fi &ndash; and even talk of a secret marriage! That said, the teleporters were a joke that Gates said Jobs would introduce next, while holodecks were a question from Walt Mossberg on when some of the cool stuff from science fiction would appear. The secret marriage joke was from Jobs, in response to a question from Kara Swisher about the biggest misunderstanding from the public about their relationship. Gates looked speechless as Jobs replied &ldquo;We&#39;ve kept our marriage secret for over a decade now&rdquo; to great audience laughter, also heard on other occasions as occasional jokes popped up. Audience members gave the pair a standing ovation, impressed by the friendly nature and obvious warm regard for each other despite their respective reputations as fierce rivals. Indeed, anyone expecting a &lsquo;celebrity deathmatch&rsquo; would have been disappointed, but such a public bust-up would never have been on the cards, it&rsquo;s just not either man&rsquo;s style. Steve Ballmer, on the other hand, with his reported chair throwing antics&hellip; but we kid, we kid. We&rsquo;re sure any chat between Ballmer and Jobs would have been almost as congenial. So, if Gates and Jobs are to be believed, with no real reason to disbelieve the, the future is looking very technologically advanced, with computers everywhere, offering great power and convenience to users, but in a way that&rsquo;s much more transparent and natural compared with the paradigm of the keyboard and mouse we&rsquo;re all familiar today. Now the talk is over, it&rsquo;s back to work, as Jobs prepares for the iPhone, new Macs, new iPods, OS X 10.5 and Apple&rsquo;s other secret projects, while Gates works on the Surface computer, Tablet computing, the Windows Home Server and his philanthropic work. So, it&rsquo;s clear that while the Apple vs Microsoft battles will remain a fixture of the computing landscape for some years to come, the two men are seemingly at peace with each other, respectful of each other&rsquo;s achievements and in different ways continuing to working together on the very things they compete on. In that respect, it&rsquo;s a funny old world, but we wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way!

Apple and EMI hope to boost legal downloads by making it easier for people to store music they have purchased and wish to play on different electronic devices. The recordings are sold without the copy-protection software known as digital rights management, or DRM. The music -- for sale in what Apple calls iTunes Plus -- includes tracks and albums by artists such as Frank Sinatra, Norah Jones, the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney. (Tunes by the Beatles are not available for legal downloading at any music site.) At $1.29 a track, the DRM-free tunes cost 30 cents more than standard iTunes songs. But Apple said the more expensive tunes also provide significantly improved sound quality. They do, however, take up roughly twice as much space on a computer or iPod. DRM was originally developed to prevent users from making numerous copies of downloaded music. But analyst Phil Leigh said DRM also discourages the mainstream user from buying legal downloads because it makes it too complicated to transfer music to other computers and playback devices. "It's kind of common sense," said Leigh, of Inside Digital Media in Tampa, Fla. "Once you enter the mass market, people aren't going to pay you to complicate their lives." Leigh predicted that other major record companies will abandon DRM to boost legal downloads and steer users away from pirated music available through peer-to-peer services such as LimeWire. Also Wednesday, Apple launched iTunes U, a section of its iTunes store that offers free course lectures, language lessons, campus tours and sports highlights from top universities including Stanford, the University of California, Berkeley, Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The content can be played on a computer or iPod. Electronics maker 2Wire Inc. is expanding its research and development operations in Nevada County, moving from a small office in Grass Valley to a larger one in neighboring Nevada City. As part of its expansion, the San Jose-based company plans to add 10 to 20 workers to augment its current staff of 29, said Steve Maher, the company's vice president of engineering. Specialties will include chip design as well as hardware and software development for 2Wire's core business of making DSL modems and wireless Internet access points for the consumer market. Americans continue to snap up cellular phones at a record pace, buying 39 million of the devices in the first quarter of 2007, up 12 percent from a year earlier, according to NPD Group. The Long Island research group said the retail value of the phones totaled nearly $3 billion. NPD analyst Ross Rubin said consumers are attracted by the razzle-dazzle features of the newest phones, including Bluetooth, removable memory and music playback. Motorola continued to lead the sales with 35 percent of the market, followed by Samsung at 17 percent, LG (15 percent), Nokia (10 percent) and Sanyo (4 percent). Tolerance for spam grows As use of the Internet grows, so does the volume of spam, but users say they are less annoyed by it than in previous years. According to a survey by the Pew Internet & American Life Project, 37 percent of those polled say they are getting more spam in their personal e-mail account, and 29 percent report more at work. Despite the increase, users say they are less irritated by the influx of junk for several reasons. First, they aren't exposed to pornographic spam as often as in the past. Indeed, only 52 percent of respondents report getting pornographic spam, down from 71 percent three years ago. Users also said spam is less annoying because they are becoming more adept at blocking it via filters and other technology.

http://www.physorg.com/news99758618.html&cid Apple Debuts Unprotected Songs Online Space & Earth science Published: 21 hours ago, 15:43 EST, Apple Debuts Unprotected Songs Online By MAY WONG , AP Technology Writer Apple(R) today launched iTunes(R) Plus, DRM-free music tracks from EMI featuring high quality 256 kbps AAC encoding for audio quality virtually indistinguishable from the original recordings for $1.29 per song. (PRNewsFoto/Apple) (AP) -- Apple Inc.'s iTunes Store started selling thousands of songs without copy protection Wednesday, marking the trendsetting company's latest coup and a model for what analysts say will likely become a pattern for online music sales. Launching initially with songs from music company EMI Group PLC, iTunes Plus features tracks that are free of digital rights management, or DRM, technology - copy-protection software that limits where songs or movies can be played and distributed. The unrestricted content means some songs purchased from iTunes will work for the first time directly on portable players other than Apple's iPod, including Microsoft Corp.'s Zune. The inaugural batch of iTunes Plus songs includes music from Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, Norah Jones, Frank Sinatra, Pink Floyd and more than a dozen of Paul McCartney's classic albums. The DRM-free tracks feature a higher sound quality and cost $1.29 apiece - 30 cents more than the usual 99-cent price of other, copy-protected songs at the market-leading online music store. If available, users could upgrade existing purchases to DRM-free versions for 30 cents a song or $3 for most albums, Apple said. London-based EMI, the world's third-largest music company by sales, and Cupertino-based Apple announced their partnership in April to deliver the industry's first major offering of DRM-free songs, sharing a vision of what both companies say their consumers want: flexibility and CD-audio quality. Other smaller online music vendors, such as eMusic.com, already offer songs without DRM, but the selections have been limited to mostly content from independent labels. Barney Wragg, the global head of digital music at EMI, said the iTunes Plus launch capped six months of work to convert most all of the company's digital catalog into a DRM-free format. "Our customers told us two things deterred them from buying digital," Wragg said. "They weren't 100 percent confident that the songs they'd purchase could play on their devices, and they wanted something closer to CD quality." Earlier this year, Apple CEO Steve Jobs called on the world's four major record companies to start selling songs online without copy-protection software. "We definitely think it's the right thing to do," Eddy Cue, Apple's vice president of iTunes, said Wednesday. "In this case, EMI's a leader and we think others will follow." In a statement Wednesday, Jobs reiterated Apple expects that more than half of the 5 million songs on iTunes will feature a DRM-free version by the end of the year. In the meantime, Apple's iTunes Store will continue to offer songs in the same copy-protected format as today at 99-cents-per-download and encoded at 128 kilobits per second. The iTunes Plus versions are encoded at 256 kbps, which Apple says makes the audio quality on par with original recordings. Apple also will continue to encode its songs - including EMI's DRM-free content - in the AAC audio format, which could force some users to go through an extra step of converting tunes into a version that would be compatible with their players. Some gadgets don't support AAC, including SanDisk's newest Sansa Connect or Samsung Electronics Co.'s YP-K3, but industry analyst Susan Kevorkian of the IDC market research company expects support for AAC will widen following Apple's move this week. Amazon.com, by comparison, said it plans to sell songs online later this year in the DRM-free MP3 format - the popular unrestricted audio standard that is supported by virtually any device, including Apple's best-selling iPod. The next generation of digital music will be untethered from usage restrictions, Kevorkian predicts. It's something major music labels - other than just EMI - will have to do if they want to combat the industry's years long decline of music CD sales, she said. "They absolutely have to reach the Internet to drive music sales, and part of that is to remove the hurdle that comes with the lack of interoperability," Kevorkian said. Shares of Apple were trading at $115.85 in afternoon trading, up $1.50 from Tuesday's closing price off $114.35. © 2006 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Soloway's arrest will help, Levine said, but with spam increasing so much over the past few years, his arrest "won't make much difference." FDA Nixes Fast Track for Cancer Vaccine Ban on Selling Wildlife Might Fuel Trade Nine Hurricanes Forecast for 2007 Cancer Expected to Skyrocket in Asia Space Station Gets Protective Panels with HP's All-in-One Storage Systems. Simple and affordable ways to set I.T. free. Robert Alan Soloway, a 27-year-old Seattle resident dubbed "Spam King" by federal agents, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with multiple counts of fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering. If convicted on the various counts, Soloway could face decades in prison. "It's good news for consumers," said John Levine, a board member of the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail (CAUCE). "Soloway has been taunting the antispam community and federal officials for years, essentially daring them to come after him, and they finally did." In a 24-page indictment filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Washington, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey C. Sullivan said that Soloway has been operating his illegal scheme since November 2003, and sent out tens of millions of spam e-mails in an effort to drum up business for his e-mail advertising software (which in turn would send out additional spam). Educating Juries on E-Mail Levine said that given Soloway's notoriety and relatively high profile, CAUCE had been wondering why it was taking so long for federal authorities to take action against him. "And now we know," Levine said. "Federal agents were building a very detailed and thorough list of charges that is not likely to fall apart at trial." The other challenge for federal prosecutors is the complexity of Internet-based fraud cases. Levine said that he served as a technical expert on one of the first spam cases in Virginia and prosecutors "spent a fortune" educating the jury on the technology involved. "It's definitely a little more complicated than 'A man walks into a bank with a gun and walks out with money,'" Levine said. "But I think that it will get steadily easier for federal prosecutors to bring these cases as the technology becomes more familiar to people." Not A CAN-SPAM Case What might surprise some people is that despite the fact that it involves e-mail and one of the nation's top spammers, the CAN-SPAM Act plays a minor role. "If you read the indictment," Levine pointed out, "the CAN-SPAM Act is barely mentioned. That reaffirms what CAUCE has been saying, that the CAN-SPAM Act is not in fact an effective law enforcement statute. Instead, this case is built on traditional criminal offenses like wire fraud and money laundering." At an arraignment on Wednesday afternoon, Soloway pleaded not guilty to all charges and was ordered held until a hearing on Monday. In addition to seeking Soloway's conviction on the various charges, the government is also looking to recover $773,000 that it says Soloway earned from his fraudulent business. Some reports have suggested that Soloway's arrest will cause a noticeable decrease in spam, but Levine suggested that any decline would unfortunately be minimal. "There's no question that [Soloway's] been responsible for a lot of spam," Levine said, "and his arrest will help. But the amount of spam has increased so much over the last couple of years that even his arrest won't make much difference." Do more, travel less with GoToMeeting  Online Meetings Made Easy .

http://www.physorg.com/news99807031.html&cid Man Described As a Top Spammer Arrested Space & Earth science Published: 8 hours ago, 05:10 EST, Man Described As a Top Spammer Arrested By GENE JOHNSON , AP Legal Affairs Writer A 27-year-old man described as one of the world's most prolific spammers was arrested Wednesday, and federal authorities said computer users across the Web could notice a decrease in the amount of junk e-mail. (AP GRAPHIC) (AP) -- A 27-year-old man described as one of the world's most prolific spammers was arrested Wednesday, and federal authorities said computer users across the Web could notice a decrease in the amount of junk e-mail. Robert Alan Soloway is accused of using networks of compromised "zombie" computers to send out millions upon millions of spam e-mails. "He's one of the top 10 spammers in the world," said Tim Cranton, a Microsoft Corp. lawyer who is senior director of the company's Worldwide Internet Safety Programs. "He's a huge problem for our customers. This is a very good day." A federal grand jury last week returned a 35-count indictment against Soloway charging him with mail fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering. Soloway pleaded not guilty Wednesday afternoon to all charges after a judge determined that - even with four bank accounts seized by the government - he was sufficiently well off to pay for his own lawyer. He has been living in a ritzy apartment and drives an expensive Mercedes convertible, said prosecutor Kathryn Warma. Prosecutors are seeking to have him forfeit $773,000 they say he made from his business, Newport Internet Marketing Corp. A public defender who represented him for Wednesday's hearing declined to comment. Prosecutors say Soloway used computers infected with malicious code to send out millions of junk e-mails since 2003. The computers are called "zombies" because owners typically have no idea their machines have been infected. He continued his activities even after Microsoft won a $7 million civil judgment against him in 2005 and the operator of a small Internet service provider in Oklahoma won a $10 million judgment, prosecutors said. U.S. Attorney Jeff Sullivan said Wednesday that the case is the first in the country in which federal prosecutors have used identity theft statutes to prosecute a spammer for taking over someone else's Internet domain name. Soloway could face decades in prison, though prosecutors said they have not calculated what guideline sentencing range he might face. The investigation began when the authorities began receiving hundreds of complaints about Soloway, who had been featured on a list of known spammers kept by The Spamhaus Project, an international anti-spam organization. The Santa Barbara County, Calif., Department of Social Services said it was spending $1,000 a week to fight the spam it was receiving, and other businesses and individuals complained of having their reputations damaged when it appeared spam was originating from their computers. "This is not just a nuisance. This is way beyond a nuisance," Warma said. Soloway used the networks of compromised computers to send out unsolicited bulk e-mails urging people to use his Internet marketing company to advertise their products, authorities said. People who clicked on a link in the e-mail were directed to his Web site. There, Soloway advertised his ability to send out as many as 20 million e-mail advertisements over 15 days for $495, the indictment said. The Spamhaus Project rejoiced at his arrest. "Soloway has been a long-term nuisance on the Internet - both in terms of the spam he sent, and the people he duped to use his spam service," organizers wrote on Spamhaus.org. Soloway remained in federal detention pending a hearing Monday. © 2006 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Click me to Wii becoming a cultural phenomenon Demented bunnies from Ubisoft's "Rayman Raving Rabbids 2" for the Nintendo Wii Photograph by : Nintendo Darren Bernhardt, CanWest News Service The stratospheric rise of Nintendo's latest gaming system has been nothing shy of Wii-markable, flattening Sony's PS3 and charging after Microsoft's Xbox 360. The company is thriving in markets around the world. The Wii was the top-selling console system in Canada, the Nintendo DS handheld was the top-selling portable gaming system, and Nintendo held the top four spots for games (Pokemon Diamond Version DS, Pokemon Pearl Version DS, Wii Play, and Super Paper Mario for Wii) for the period of April 8 to May 5, according to the latest Canadian figures released by independent market researchers NPD Group Inc. Nintendo boasted the same achievements in the United States while in France the 15 top-selling games are all for Nintendo systems. "We're ecstatic over the explosive appeal of Wii and Nintendo DS," said vice president and general manager of Nintendo of Canada Ron Bertram. At the November 2006 launch of the Wii in Toronto, Bertram anticipated good things for the console and hoped for "a strong second place" showing. The actual success is beyond anyone's expectations. In less than five months since introduction, the company has sold six million Wii systems globally and nearly 29 million Wii games. The console has taken a step toward becoming a cultural phenomenon. "Wii is selling out everything we put into the marketplace," said Reggie Fils-Aime, president and CEO of Nintendo of America, speaking at a conference in Seattle on May 22 to announce sales achievements and upcoming games for the company. Sony's PS3, which launched about the same time as the Wii, has sold just 1.84 million units worldwide, while Microsoft has sold more than 10 million Xbox 360 consoles worldwide. The 360, launched in November 2005, had a year head-start over the others. Nintendo now expects to have sold 14 million Wiis by the end of its first fiscal year, March 2008, and has ramped up production to meet the demand. In comparison, about 22 million GameCubes have been sold since its launch in November 2001. Sony's PS2, which launched in October 2000, has sold more than 106 million units around the world but there is now debate over whether Sony can maintain its dominance over the industry. The reason for Nintendo's rise is its approach to new consumers and giving them something different, said Fils-Aime. With its innovative motion-sensing controller, Wii gamers get as close to the action as possible. Players swing the controller like a baseball bat or golf club, leap around their living rooms to make a backhand return in tennis, jab madly away at the air in a boxing bout, and point it at the screen to aim their weapons. Sitting on the couch and pressing buttons just doesn't cut it anymore. The Wii remote controller is also simple to use. It's based more on gestures than button combinations, so there are very few gadgets on it, making it less intimidating to people who've never played games before. Nintendo has also taken aim at non-gamers with titles that veer away from the shooters and racers that appeal to males aged 18 to 35.

Apple TV Links With YouTube Apple TV will soon be wirelessly streaming videos directly from YouTube and playing them on a TV. Part 1 of a special five-part series. Lexton Snol, PC Advisor Thursday, AM PDT Apple is bringing YouTube content to the living room with its Apple TV home-entertainment system. Beginning in mid-June, Apple TV will wirelessly stream videos directly from YouTube and play them on a user's wide-screen TV. Using Apple TV's interface and Apple Remote, viewers will be able to browse, find and watch free videos from YouTube in the comfort of their living room rather than in the study on their PC. "This is the first time users can easily browse, find and watch YouTube videos right from their living room couch, and it's really, really fun," said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. "YouTube is a worldwide sensation, and Apple TV is bringing it directly from the Internet onto the wide-screen TV in your living room." Apple claims that thousands of the most current and popular YouTube videos will be available on Apple TV at launch in mid-June, with YouTube adding thousands more each week until the full YouTube catalogue is available this autumn. YouTube members can also log-in to their YouTube accounts on Apple TV to view and save their favorite videos. Apple TV requires iTunes 7.1 or later running on a Windows PC with Windows XP Home/Professional (SP2), or a Mac with Mac OS X version 10.3.9 or later. / 1000 max characters Free Music Videos From Warner iTunes U Comes to the iTunes Store MySpace&#039;s Parent to Buy Photobucket Free TV on Your PC: Joost Test Drive In Pictures: NHK&#039;s Successor to HDTV PayPlay.FM Sells 1.3M MP3 Files for $0.88 Each Prepare for Mobile Security Threats Conditions are right for mobile security threats to start overwhelming businesses and consumers in North America.

Is Web 2.0 Safe? As users store more data online, hackers are finding ways to break into the new service sites. Experts say the problems are deep-seated. Part 1 of a special five-part series. Robert McMillan, PC World Wednesday, May 30, 2007 4:00 PM PDT Web Apps That Work Offline Erik Larkin, PC World If you've spent time using Google Docs & Spreadsheets, you're familiar with the service's great features. You are also familiar with a semiregular 'Disconnected' error that forces you to toss out your recent changes or switch to a read-only version of your document when your browser loses touch with the Google service. That's the Achilles' heel of today's rich and promising desktop-like Web apps: They require a hiccup-free Internet connection. If anything interrupts that link, you can lose sync--and your data. At the very least, your info is out of reach. But developers are working to get around that drawback, using intelligent caching to build offline functionality into their Web applications and browsers. A new desktop version of Zimbra's browser-based productivity suite can cache your e-mail and calendar data, untethering Zimbra's app from an Internet connection. And a still-in-the-works offering from promises a Web app with calendaring and other features that will continue to function even when you activate your browser's "work offline" mode. Mozilla.org is taking an even broader approach, building offline caching into , due out in beta this summer. Any Web site will be able to take advantage of the feature, though online apps will need to be updated to make use of it. While caching can free Web apps from the need for a Web connection, another emerging technology aims to free them from the browser. With promises reminiscent of Sun's Java, Adobe says that its new , available as an alpha release, allows Web developers to write applications using online programming tools like Flash and Ajax that run on the desktop without a browser. According to the company, Apollo programs will run the same on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows, just like the Web apps they're based on. is one early example of this kind of browser-independent Web app. You can embed its playlist-based music program in your blog or Web site--or you can download an Apollo version and run the player by itself.

http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/12559/1103/&cid iTWire - Email documents leave directors and executives exposed IT and TELCO JOBS Submit your release now Start submitting to iTWire How to post video Email documents leave directors and executives exposed Friday, 08 April 2005 Tough new international reporting standards, and broader definitions of evidence and records to include electronic documents and emails, are opening Australian executives to prosecution, according to speakers at a Sydney roundtable on e-exposure in the workplace. Benjamin Woolley, vP sales & marketing at email and documents management specialist Redmap, speaking to an audience of 55 CIOs and corporate executives at a panel discussion held at the State Library of NSW, warned that few organisations have the processes in place to ensure important documents are not deleted or lost. This will leave organisations, directors and executives vulnerable when it comes time to meet reporting legislation," Woolley said. The worldwide trend is for governments to demand better corporate compliance, governance and risk management. It has spurred the introduction of reporting standards such as Sarbanes-Oxley, IFRS and CLERP 9 that are driving a new generation of electronic archiving, document management and e-audit. Nick Abrahams, Partner at Deacons law firm, who also spoke during the session, outlined electronic record retention and email compliance obligations under Australian law. There are obligations to retain emails for corporate audit and compliance requirements, said Abrahams. Under the Electronic Transactions Act, anything you can do in the off-line world, you can do online. All emails are potential legal obligations or liabilities and can be used as evidence or as part of a legal discovery process. Depending on their content, emails can be regarded as part of an organisations official records. Certain records must be kept for at least five years if they relate to taxes, six years if they relate to industrial relations, and seven years if they relate to areas such as workers compensation or various sections of the Australian Corporations Act, Abrahams said. Woolley also reported a huge surge in demand for new technology to meet privacy, accounting and global reporting requirements in Australia and the United States. Redmap is experiencing explosive growth as we provide systems that ensure email and electronic information is stored and accessible. From vital records to critical business information, Redmap technology helps capture and index electronic documents to strict archival standards. Weve worked for over 10 years in archival technology services for governments, commercial and industrial corporations worldwide, and our latest packages are one of the few to provide everyman access to stringent archival systems in line with the new global requirements. GPLv3: the sting remains, says RMS Samsung's triple-treat mobile memory YouTube goes AppleTube as Apple TV gets upgrade Has Jobs backed the wrong horse with Apple TV's YouTube access?

This technology is designed to keep interference away from the iPhone that other gadgets and devices might cause. Just a small detector chip is all it takes. Apple plans on alerting you also when your signal becomes fuzzy or interrupted via audio or text. Here&#8217;s the kicker, though. Although the patent doesn&#8217;t mention the iPhone at all, it clearly states that the technology is designed for a cellphone with media capabilities. Sounds like an iPhone to me!

Loving Star Trek is about as dorky as a dork can get. But one Star Trek fan had the last laugh when he sold his one bedroom flat for more than the market value. Tony Alleyne sold his home that he transformed into the deck of the starship Voyager for a staggering $843,242 or Â£425,000. As you would imagine, transforming your bachelor pad into a flight deck is not an easy (or cheap) task. Tony spent nearly Â£30,000 and eight-hours a day for two years working on the project. When completed, he went and did what any shrewd businessman would do: he sold it on eBay.

But in the interest of generating site traffic, and to secure bragging rights of being &#8220;first!&#8221; if it&#8217;s somehow real, and because we&#8217;re reckless, we bring it to you now.

He/She said they were nervous over Mr. Jobs accidentally spilling secrets two weeks before its official unveiling at . The source said something jokingly about how it&#8217;s really a re-designed version of Vista, and, to their surprise, the PR type said, &#8220;No, Vista runs great on the new Macs by itself, and Bootcamp 2 lets us ship it as an add-on option for dual-boot.&#8221; Or something to that effect. We&#8217;re thinking the Apple PR person was messing with our source, the idea is to run ideas up the flagpole to see if they fly. We really don&#8217;t see any Macs shipping with dual-boot to Windows anytime soon, but Steve has surprised us before, so who knows?

AMD adds to embedded line with two new low-power CPUs by Justin Mann on May 31, 2007, 11:24 AM | In a press release issued yesterday, announced the introduction of two new low-power processors aimed at embedded and fanless designs. With the introduction of the Sempron 2100+ and the Geode LX 800, they have a low power and a ultra low power design that is ideal for systems without fans or systems that need a very low power profile. The Sempron 2100+ will draw a mere 9W, but offers the higher performance you get from the Athlon architecture. That CPU is probably aimed at media centers, DVRs or other such environments where you need both high processing power but low noise. The Geode demands only a tenth of what the Sempron does at 0.9W, making it perfect for very embedded products like firewalls, radios and other specialty machines. This ads on to the existing Geode line, which has a long standing history as being a popular chip for embedded devices. However, there exists a noticeable gap when it comes to processors ideal for fanless systems and processors capable of acting as media centers, which both Intel and AMD are now starting to realize. That's where the Sempron fits in, and hopefully they'll continue to expand upon that idea. You can read the Remote Play arrives with PSP firmware update by Jose Vilches on May 31, 2007, 9:29 AM | PlayStation 3 firmware 1.80 update, a new functionality was introduced which would allow PSP owners to access all videos, music, and pictures on their home PS3 over the Internet, a feature previously available only on a local network. But it wasnt until todays PSP firmware 3.50 update that the Remote Play over the internet feature is actually for PSP and PS3 owners. After applying the update, you'll need to hook the two consoles together via USB for a certification process, which means that when you are out and about, your PS3 will know it's you calling in from the cloud. Besides the Remote Feature enhancement the update also includes a new 'RSS Channel Guide' feature under the 'RSS Channel' menu. The new firmware should be available via your PSP's Network Update option. Apple TV to play YouTube videos by Jose Vilches on May 31, 2007, 9:28 AM | YouTube, the popular Google-owned video website will make their in June through the Apple TV set-top box. The partnership with YouTube was revealed yesterday by Jobs during his talk at the D: All Things Digital conference in Carlsbad, California. "This is the first time users can easily browse, find and watch YouTube videos right from their living room couch, and it's really, really fun," said Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive. "YouTube is a worldwide sensation, and Apple TV is bringing it directly from the internet onto the widescreen TV." Before the announcement, Apple TV owners looking for content were mostly limited to move their own home videos to Apples set-top box or to stream television programs they had previously purchased through the iTunes Store on a Mac or PC. With this deal Apple begins extending their offerings through select, controlled partners. But the deal could also put Apple in the middle of a copyright infringement battle over videos shown on the web. YouTube is currently being sued for $1 billion by MTV-owner Viacom, which following the announcement said: "We're always vigilant about protecting our copyrights," said a Viacom spokeswoman. "But we would welcome the opportunity to license our content to Apple as we do with all distributors." In addition to the YouTube deal, Apple also announced it will start selling a new version of the Apple TV with a 160 GB hard drive for up to 200 hours of video, 36,000 songs, 25,000 photos or a combination of each. The newer model will set you back $399 and will be available on Thursday. Gates and Jobs joint appearance at D5 by Julio Franco on May 31, 2007, 6:06 AM | There was a lot of speculation and chatter about an interview taking place this year that would put Bill Gates and Steve Jobs together in public after a long time. This interview took place yesterday in Carlsbad, California, at the D5 conference. Here's a taste of the joint appearance, with the complete videos available for viewing Google launches Google Gears for offline webapps by Justin Mann on May 30, 2007, 8:24 PM | One of the great parts about web apps is that they are on the web, and can be accessed from anywhere you have net access. One of the worst parts about web apps is that they are on the web, and if you don't have access to the net you don't have access to the apps. Google has long been talking about being able to move web apps onto the desktop and let them work offline, and now is putting that talk into action. Today they , a browser plugin that enables web apps to run even when no connection is present. Interestingly, they also have released for the plugin, perhaps to encourage adoption for multiple platforms and to get more interest in Google Developer Day. Obviously support will be limited at first, but the ultimate goal is to allow people to use any online apps offline until a connection can be restored, which would be particularly useful to people with unstable or slow connections, or to prevent work from getting cut off in the event of an outage. by Justin Mann on May 30, 2007, 7:03 PM | All of you FireFox users (and there is a lot of us), today the next update for the 2.0 branch was released. is available for download, and brings several important fixes. On the Windows side, several changes were made to Windows Vista support, though there are still a few unresolved issues such as a slightly broken IE7 migration and no WMP integration. Five security fixes have been included for all platforms, only one of which was rated critical, and a few other minor changes have been included.

Webcasters ask for stay on Internet radio royalty increase by Justin Mann on May 30, 2007, 5:02 PM | Once again, supporters of Internet radio have headed to the courts and are pleading for of the new royalty rates. The increase in royalty rates, which have been delayed several times now, threaten to severely harm or shut down many smaller Internet radio sites. SaveNetRadio, one of the bigger groups fighting against the rate increases, is working to stop the increase from happening at all: The SaveNetRadio Coalition, whose members include prominent Net radio operators RealNetworks, Yahoo, Pandora and Live365, said it hoped the move will allow Congress more time to act on two similar proposals that would reverse the royalty rate increases. The controversy over the rate increases has gotten increased attention over the past few months. Recently, Government backing for SaveNetRadio , following a decision to delay the increase earlier this year. Time marches on, however, and no matter how much you push back a deadline it'll still eventually catch up to you. Many companies are opposed to the rate increases, including members of the SaveNetRadio group such as RealNetworks, Yahoo, Pandora and Live365, all of which maintain Internet radio stations. Palm unveils unimpressive Treo companion dubbed Foleo by Jose Vilches on May 30, 2007, 3:25 PM | Palm today at the D conference , a Linux-based, 10 inch screen device designed to work as a smartphone companion; it will connect via Bluetooth to a Treo device running either the Palm operating system or Windows Mobile to send and receive e-mails and edit documents using a full-sized keyboard. The Foleo, Hawkins said, represents the first in a new line of devices aimed at redefining how people work while away from their desks. In a nod to the popularity of competing products, he added that he expects the Foleo to work with BlackBerry devices, from RIM, and with Apple's upcoming iPhone. The Foleo will be priced at $599 with an introductory rebate of $100, bringing it down to $499; it weighs just over 2 pounds and has an estimated battery life of 5 hours. Unfortunately for Palm the Foleo failed to impress the audience. "I can't think of why people would go out and buy this," Jack Gold, an analyst at J. Gold Associates in Northboro, said. "I don't understand the market for it. They say their target market is those who do a lot of e-mails on a bigger screen, but my point is, why not get a mini laptop instead?" And I have to agree with the critic, sure it is lighter and cheaper than a laptop computer but it doesnt really do anything an ultra-portable notebook or an UMPC can do better. Even if price is the main selling point here  and it isnt  you can get an entry-level laptop these days for almost the same price. Microsoft, Intel and Dell to develop standard NAND interface by Justin Mann on May 30, 2007, 3:07 PM | announced today a partnership between themselves, that will see the development of a standard NAND Flash Memory interface for PCs. The new group, called the Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface Group, is led by Intel and is designed around using flash memory to accelerate functions in a modern operating system, such as with ReadyBoost and ReadyDrive in Windows Vista. The idea is to help adoption of this idea increase, so that the benefits of using it can be realized. Whether or not Intel or other companies will be providing this interface for software other than Windows isn't mentioned, though the wording is such that it seems likely that it will be an open specification. The new interface is designed to operate with software drivers, so it may be up to third parties to develop on top of it: ONFI formed last year to standardize the interface between the Flash controller and the NAND itself, and standardizing the register level interface between the Flash controller and the operating system driver is the logical next step. They expect to have a standard specified before the end of the year.

With the huge success of the Wii, the black market for Wii games piracy emerges. In an effort to halt the viability of Wii mods, Nintendo has new Wii motherboards that are supposedly tamper-proof. The motherboard has been changed as three pins have been cut from a surface-mounted IC to stop the current line of mod chips from working properly. New chips will likely be coming out to go around the problem but at the moment it is not a possibility. Wii console sales dont seem hurt by modchippers; in fact they might actually be boosting the consoles demand in markets with raging piracy issues. Game sales on the other hand, are more likely to be affected by this. According to George Harrison senior vice president of marketing at Nintendo of America, the company is targeting sales of 35 million Wiis in the US. Fox Interactive Media acquires Photobucket, Flektor by Jose Vilches on May 30, 2007, 1:05 PM | for some time now, MySpace's parent, News Corp.'s Fox Interactive Media has its agreements to acquire image-sharing site Photobucket and slide show mashup creator Flektor. Although the financial terms of the agreements were not disclosed, the rumored price has been about $250 million. "As a leading site for creative expression, Photobucket extends our reach among personal media-sharing enthusiasts, and the innovative new entrant Flektor brings highly differentiated new tools to the table that will drive the next generation," Peter Levinsohn, president of Fox Interactive Media, said in a statement. "Together, they represent a powerful combination and we are thrilled for them to join our network." According to a statement by Photobuckets co-founder Alex Welch, there will be no changes in day-to-day operations as Photobucket will not become part of MySpace properties, allowing standalone operation within Fox Interactive Media. The deal is not expected to boost MySpace's audience given the significant user overlap between the two. However, the deal gives Fox access to the technology necessary to further integrate their services offerings. PQI announces 256GB solid state disk by Justin Mann on May 30, 2007, 11:55 AM | We all know that SSD is the future. Mechanical disks still have a long life ahead of them, but eventually the numerous advantages of flash will overtake the disadvantages. One of the biggest hurdles next to price is capacity. It wasn't until just a few months ago that 32GB SSDs were even feasible, and only very recently have we seen them being placed in to laptops. , however, has gone more than a step above. They unveiled this week the largest mass-produced SSD, announcing the 256GB Turbo+ drive. At 256GB, it easily rivals standard desktop hard drives for size, and with an impressive transfer rate of 60MByte/sec it also exceeds them on performance (though no word on its exact performance specifications, such as sustained write speeds). The very fact they have created such a drive is impressive, though it brings out one of the most glaring issues with flash: Cost. The unit's memory alone, not factoring in the controller and other technology needed, is nearly $2200. A drive that exceeds the value of most computers is not a drive that will sell well, though it is clearly a step towards something greater. PQI is obviously heavily invested into flash, and made a bold statement about how quickly it will be adopted: PQI expects SSD to become the hard drive of the future and in 2008, SSD may replace up to 30% of traditional hard drive market." 30% in only a year from now is a huge increase over a technology that was largely unheard of for mass storage just a year ago. The consumer almost always votes with their wallet, however, so clearly PQI expects the cost of flash to drop dramatically. With many other vendors like Seagate also pushing for SSDs, I look forward to what this year and next will bring. You can read the press release at Samsung embeds 4GB storage for mobile phones by Jose Vilches on May 30, 2007, 11:22 AM | a new multi-chip package dubbed 'moviMCP', with an included NAND flash chip for mobile phones dubbed 'moviNAND' boosting internal memory storage capacity to 4GB, which could eliminate the need for manufacturers to include external SD, miniSD or microSD slots for memory expansion. "Weve now perfected a memory chip that allows handset manufacturers to significantly reduce development time while deploying an extremely robust design that will result in higher performance for smaller phones, with higher storage capacities," said Samsung's Jim Elliott. The arrival of larger flash memory chips is good news for the mobile market with the increasing combination of features such as digital camera, mp3 player and PDA all in the same device. The 4 GB moviMCP is currently available for OEM sampling and Samsung expects to ship 392 million units by the end of the year. Lite-On reportedly lands Xbox 360 drive deal by Jose Vilches on May 30, 2007, 11:22 AM | According to a report by , Lite-On has secured OEM orders for DVD-ROM drives to be built into Microsoft Xbox 360 consoles, becoming the secondary OEM maker of the built-in DVD-ROM drive after Korean corporation Toshiba Samsung Storage Technology (TSST). The built-in DVD-ROM drives for the Xbox 360 have been produced by two OEM makers, Toshiba-Samsung Storage Technology (TSST) and BenQ, the sources indicated. Lite-On IT took over BenQ's optical disc drive business unit in mid-2006 but did not take over the OEM manufacturing rights for Xbox 360 because it was required to obtain new certification from Microsoft, the sources pointed out. Lite-On will begin monthly shipments of 0.8 to 1 million units starting in the third quarter of 2007, to comply with Microsofts sales goal of 15 million Xbox 360 consoles sold this year. Last.fm to be acquired by CBS by Justin Mann on May 30, 2007, 11:14 AM | , one of the most popular Internet radio related sites around, will have its ownership change hands soon. U.S. based CBS will be acquiring Last.fm for a , adding the site to its already huge portfolio. For their investment, CBS will be gaining the attention of the 15 million Last.fm users, but supposedly will allow the existing management to run things as they wish, including existing expansion projects: Under the terms of the acquisition, Last.fm's founders will continue to run the firm independently. Taking the service to mobile devices will be near the top of their to-do list: Pandora recently announced a raft of developments to free its stations from PC-based listening. Hopefully the impact of a new owner will be very limited, as the service is already successful. One thing is for sure, they will have no concerns if or when the royalty increases demanded by the RIAA and others occurs, as with financial backing like CBS money will be a minor object. DRM-Free tracks now available on iTunes Plus by Jose Vilches on May 30, 2007, 10:48 AM | new version of iTunes released today Apple has launched iTunes Plus, a premium service that offers music tracks free of copy protection, keeping its promise to offer EMI Group's digital catalog in May, including singles and albums from Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, Norah Jones, Frank Sinatra, Joss Stone, Pink Floyd and John Coltrane. The new protection-free music tracks as high quality 256 kbps AAC encoded audio and will sell for $1.29 per song, thats a $0.30 premium over DRM protected songs. The new DRM-free songs will drop the unfair restrictions on the way consumers can listen to songs they have legally purchased, allowing them to easily play their music files on any music player other than an Apple iPod. The iTunes Store is the leading online music store with over 2.5 billion songs sold, a market Amazon is going after with its recently announced online music store that will sell only unprotected MP3 songs. Apart from selling music, Apple has also sold over 50 million TV shows and over two million movies, making it the leader in each of those markets too. Steve Ballmer unveils Microsoft Surface by Jose Vilches on May 30, 2007, 9:46 AM | Today at The Wall Street Journals D: All Things Digital conference in Carlsbad, California, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer a new product called Microsoft Surface, a multi-touch sensitive surface computer running a highly customized version of Windows Vista that the company hopes will change the way people interact with technology. Microsoft Surface is a 30-inch horizontal display that sits on a nearly 2-foot tall table fully controlled by touch, as you manipulate objects on screen with your fingers. Even more impressive it can identify real-world objects placed upon it, in a from Popular Mechanics you can actually see how a Wi-Fi capable digital camera is immediately recognized when placed on the table and watch as pictures spill out onto the surface. Five special infrared cameras that can sense nearby objects are mounted beneath the screen to capture users input, allowing simultaneous multi-touch input from up to four different users at the same time. The product is expected to cost between $5,000 and $10,000 and it is initially being aimed to be used in shops, hotel lobbies, casinos and bars. Microsofts new surface computer appears to fit in with its connected entertainment focus and long-term vision of the digital home of the future where people can easily and naturally interact with the digital world. Among other tangible prototypes at the group's Seattle headquarters includes a talking user interface installed inside a wall called "Grace" and computerized kitchen work surfaces which can recognize ingredients and guide on recipes. ASUS Radeon HD 2900XT review @ TechSpot by Julio Franco on May 30, 2007, 5:12 AM | After months of delays and much anticipation, ATI has finally come up with the Radeon HD 2900 XT , a DirectX 10 capable GPU meant to compete with Nvidia's GeForce 8 series, and the first big introduction in the PC enthusiast market since AMD acquired the company. Today we have in our hands a Radeon HD 2900XT board, which is of course based on the R600 core using an 80nm design process. This version features just 512MB of onboard GDDR3 memory clocked at 1656MHz using a 512-bit wide memory bus. Combined with a core clock of 757MHz, the Radeon HD 2900XT can theoretically produce a memory bandwidth of 102.4GB/s, which is greater than that of the GeForce 8800 GTX. Apple patches two QuickTime vulnerabilities by Justin Mann on May 29, 2007, 8:25 PM | Separate from their larger updates, Apple has to address two flaws in QuickTime, both of which could lead to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerabilities, both of which stem from QuickTime's Java implementation, could expose a system if someone were to visit a maliciously crafted website. The majority of security updates do seem to be centered around that, which makes perfect sense. Browsing the web is one of the few aspects that just about every Internet-connected desktop has in common. Being that QuickTime is a fairly popular media player, it makes sense that it would become a more popular target. Apple has been in the news quite a bit this year with security updates, partially due to the increased attention on OS X and the increasing (albeit slowly) marketshare of the Mac. You can read the advisory surrounding these two flaws at Microsoft to update Vista logo label system in 2008 by Justin Mann on May 29, 2007, 7:00 PM | , as well as many PC vendors, have faced lashback from the Vista labeling system, which many have claimed is ambiguous and doesn't do enough to differentiate between what a Vista capable system and what a Vista Premium capable system is. Some have gone so far as to . That said, Microsoft will be a machine will need to be Vista Premium labeled. In about a year from now, any machine sold touting the Vista Premium label will need to include a DX10 compatible GPU, which directly corresponds to Microsoft and other developers getting ready to release many DX10 titles over the next year. Will this create more confusion? It seems that for a while, you might have a large number of machines labeled Vista Premium capable, some of which have DX9 cards and some which don't. However, with the two major vendors already supporting DX10, it is unlikely that any machine shipped with Vista Premium would appear without a DX10 card in the first place. However, could it also indicate future label changes as they deem fit? In that case, what good would any label serve if it can be invalidated by future iterations?

http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-070530itunes-story,0,6913562.story%3Fcoll%3Dchi-bizfront-hed&cid Apple begins selling unprotected EMI music on iTunes | Chicago Tribune A $100 million mystery Red wolf pups unveiled at Lincoln Park Zoo Billboard called racy, wrong A most hollow oratory on Memorial Day Harry Potter theme park coming to Orlando's Universal Studios Stocks Up After Takeover News, GDP Data New York Stock Exchange City disaster chief resigns Apple begins selling unprotected EMI music on iTunes Published May 30, 2007, 10:53 AM CDT Apple Inc. began selling digital music from EMI Group Plc without copyright protection software on its iTunes store, giving Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs a victory in his campaign to see all online songs sold that way. EMI announced in April it would offer its catalog, excluding music by The Beatles, without digital rights management software. Apple is selling the DRM-free songs for $1.29 each through a new "iTunes Plus" service and continues to offer copy-protected versions for 99 cents, the company said today in a statement. Jobs in February asked EMI, Universal Music Group, Sony BMG Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group Corp. to let Apple remove DRM software from iTunes tracks. While the software helps stop illegal copying, it doesn't let buyers play songs on devices other than Apple's iPod. EMI's move may pressure the other labels to follow suit. The four control 70 percent of the world's music. "How fast other music labels come on board depends on what happens with this grand Apple-EMI experiment," said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at JupiterResearch in New York. "It was a seminal moment for the industry to have a hardware vendor and content owner talk about the implications for what a DRM-free world might look like." Shares of London-based EMI fell 1.5 pence to 274.75 pence. Cupertino, California-based Apple, also maker of the Macintosh computer, rose 91 cents to $115.26 at 11:05 a.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. They climbed 35 percent this year before today. Separately, Apple today said it created an area on iTunes to offer free course lectures, language lessons and sports highlights from universities including Stanford and Duke. Apple expects more than half of the 5 million songs on iTunes to be offered in the DRM-free format by the end of the year, Jobs said today. EMI's DRM-free catalog numbers in the "hundreds of thousands" of songs, the company said. "We've seen a tremendous amount of interest from independent labels and even other major labels, and the other majors are interested in seeing how this goes," iTunes chief Eddy Cue said in an interview. "EMI has been a leader in this. Everybody else gets to watch and learn." Universal, Sony BMG and Warner have all experimented with selling unprotected tracks online. Jobs, 52, called on the labels to offer DRM-free music in an open letter on Apple's Web site that cast him as a champion for consumers. Songs purchased on iTunes only play on the iPod, while music bought from rival sites is tied to gadgets that work with their DRM systems, Jobs said in the Feb. 6 essay. EMI, the world's third-largest music label, said at the time it recognized the lack of flexibility between music players was "increasingly becoming an issue for music consumers." Two months later, Jobs joined EMI CEO Eric Nicoli on stage in London to announce the new licensing arrangement. Nicoli said the DRM-free options should help spur overall digital sales and may offset a decline in CD sales. EMI said digital music may account for 25 percent of revenue by 2010. EMI represents more than 1,300 artists, including Coldplay, the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Norah Jones and Lily Allen, according to the company's Web site. While Apple will be the first to offer its DRM-free catalog, EMI said it expects to make the tracks available to other distribution partners. EMI said it expects a "significant jump" in sales because of the DRM-free option, which delivers songs with better audio quality, said Barney Wragg, head of the digital business at EMI. "There's a whole range of people who have been online who have been put off because they didn't understand this issue of interoperability," Wragg said in an interview. "We're really pleased that Apple had exactly the same vision that we did for how the market would develop." The DRM-free songs are twice as large as the copy-protected version and may take twice as long to download depending on the speed of customers' Internet connections, Cue said. The Beatles' catalog, which includes hits such as "Let It Be" and "Yesterday," isn't legally distributed on the Internet. While EMI has rights to distribute the group's recordings on CDs and other physical formats, Apple Corps Ltd. hasn't yet granted digital rights to the songs. Apple Corps is owned by Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, John Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and the estate of George Harrison. McCartney, who began offering his solo catalog online for the first time in recent weeks, told BillBoard Magazine this month that a decision to sell the group's music online is "virtually settled." EMI had no news today about the Beatles move online, Wragg said. Through iTunes, which operates in 22 countries, Apple has sold more than 2.5 billion songs since April 2003. The service has more than 70 percent of the market for music downloads, according to the NPD Group Inc. in Port Washington, New York.

The technology, called Google Gears, would allow users of computers, phones and other devices to manipulate Web services like e-mail, online calendars or news readers whether online, intermittently connected to the Web or completely offline. By bridging the gulf between new Web services and the older world of desktop software, where any data changes are stored locally on users' machines, Google is pushing the Web into whole new spheres of activity and posing a challenge to rival Microsoft Corp., leader in the desktop software era. "The Web is great but it doesn't work very well when you don't have a Web connection," Jeff Huber, Google's vice president of engineering, said in an interview. "Gears addresses a functional gap on the Web." Google plans to make the Gears technology available for free as "open source" software, meaning other developers are free to use and enhance the software in their own products. Gears promises to expand the usage of scores of Google products and services, as well as thousands of programs from independent software makers, by making them more accessible at previously inconvenient times and places. The technology also allows developers to build Internet search and indexing of Web pages into their own software applications, Huber said. Many such products will be able to make limited searches offline, since they will have downloaded data automatically when connected. Google's full Web search functions would return once the user reconnects to the Internet. Early partners who will use Gears in their products include design software leader Adobe Systems Inc., maker of Flash animation and Acrobat document-sharing software, as well as new Apollo tools that work online and offline, Adobe said. Other organizations working with Google are Norway's Opera Software ASA, maker of a Web browser popular with mobile phone users, and Mozilla, the group behind Firefox, the biggest alternative to Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, according to Google.

Feature Wars Intensify in Mapping Tech May 30, 2007 9:34AM With Microsoft introducing new 3D map options and Google rolling out Street View mapping technology, some are wondering what the possible ROI for these features might be. According to analyst Greg Sterling, the steady introduction of new mapping features is driven to a large extent by competition rather than by an expectation of revenue. Palm's Foleo: Measuring the Impact Feds Arrest 'Spam King' in Seattle IRS Spoof Targets Execs Through RTF CDW Accepts $7.3 Billion To Go Private Palm Foleo: A 'Smartphone Companion' According to the great British satirist Douglas Adams, the stages of a civilization can be summarized in three questions: 1. How can we eat? (Survival); 2. Why do we eat? (Inquiry); and 3. Where shall we have lunch? (Sophistication). It's the last of those questions -- the search for a good place to eat -- that is driving the most recent Web battle: the push to make online mapping services increasingly sophisticated and user-friendly. Both Google, which operates Google Maps, and , which runs Live Search Maps, announced new features on Tuesday that are designed to help users plan trips, get previews of where they are going, and, most importantly, find businesses that might be persuaded to advertise with the mapping services. Two weeks ago, Google signaled the intensity of its work in this area by launching the Google Lat Long Blog, devoted specifically to the company's work on its maps, Google Earth, its local map service, and related APIs. "Things are changing so fast," said John Hanke, the Director of Google Earth and Maps, in the blog's initial post, "we thought a blog focused on this topic would be the best way to communicate with you, both about our products and about the overall development of geo on the Web." At the Where 2.0 conference on Tuesday, Hanke rolled out two new Google developments: "Street View" and "Mapplets." The Street View feature offers map users 360 degree images of streets in various urban areas around the country. Initially, images are available for portions of the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver, and Miami, with other areas to be added later. If street level views are available for a particular area, a new button labeled "Street View" will appear on the Google map. Users can click on the image, pan in every direction, and even move forward or back, creating the illusion of walking down the street. The other feature introduced by Google, Mapplets, is designed to help developers and consumers create mini-applications that can be embedded on Google Maps to provide information or perform simple tasks. Three sample applications demonstrated by Google included real estate listings, movie times, and a distance-measurement tool. In its press release, Google said that several of its partners, including WeatherBug and Booking.com, have already created customized Mapplets. "Maps are an enormously popular application," said Greg Sterling, an Internet search analyst and founder of Sterling Market Intelligence. "They've proven to draw millions of users. In fact, Google Maps may be its most successful product, apart from search. These new features are designed to reinforce that usage."

Photograph: Roger Tooth/Guardian Web users worldwide could notice a welcome reduction in unsolicited emails offering penis enlargements and other dubious services after a man described as one of the globe's top 10 most prolific spammers was arrested. Robert Alan Soloway, 27, from Seattle, appeared in a US court yesterday, accused of a series of federal crimes including mail fraud, email fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering. US authorities said such was the scale of his activities, web users could easily notice a reduction in the amount of junk email clogging their inboxes. "He's one of the top 10 spammers in the world," said Tim Cranton, a lawyer and director of Microsoft's Worldwide Internet Safety Programs. "He's a huge problem for our customers. This is a very good day." It is the first time federal prosecutors have used identity theft laws to prosecute a spammer for taking over someone else's internet domain name, theoretically leaving Mr Soloway facing a long prison sentence. A federal grand jury last week returned a 35-count indictment against Mr Soloway. He pleaded not guilty at yesterday's hearing, during which a judge ruled he was wealthy enough to pay for his own defence, even after having four bank accounts frozen by the government. He remains in custody ahead of a new hearing on Monday. Prosecutor Kathryn Warma said authorities were seeking to seize almost &#163;400,000 they believe Mr Soloway made from his business, Newport Internet Marketing Corp. The company was successful enough for him to live in an expensive apartment and drive a Mercedes convertible, she added. Prosecutors allege Mr Soloway used networks of "zombie" computers - so-called because their owners have no idea they have been infected with malicious code - to send out millions of junk emails from 2003. His website claimed he was able to send out as many as 20 million email advertisements over 15 days for around &#163;250, the indictment said. Mr Soloway continued his activities even after Microsoft won a &#163;3.5m civil judgment against him in 2005, and the operator of a small internet service provider in Oklahoma won a &#163;5m judgment, prosecutors said.

Launching with songs from music company EMI Group, iTunes Plus features tracks that are free of digital rights management, or DRM, technology. The unrestricted content means some songs purchased from iTunes will work for the first time directly on portable players other than Apple's iPod, including Microsoft's Zune. The inaugural batch of iTunes Plus songs includes music from Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, Norah Jones, Frank Sinatra, Pink Floyd and more than a dozen of Paul McCartney's classic albums. The DRM-free tracks feature a higher sound quality and cost $US1.29 ($1.56) apiece - US30c more than the usual US99c price of other, copy-protected songs at the market-leading online music store. If available, users could upgrade existing purchases to DRM-free versions for US30c a song or $US3 for most albums, Apple said. EMI, the world's third-largest music company by sales, and Apple announced their partnership in April to deliver the industry's first major offering of DRM-free songs, sharing a vision of what both companies say their consumers want: flexibility and CD-audio quality. Other smaller online music vendors, such as eMusic.com, already offer songs without DRM, but the selections have been limited to mostly content from independent labels. Barney Wragg, the global head of digital music at EMI, said the iTunes Plus launch capped six months of work to convert most all of the company's digital catalogue into a DRM-free format. "Our customers told us two things deterred them from buying digital," Mr Wragg said. "They weren't 100 per cent confident that the songs they'd purchase could play on their devices, and they wanted something closer to CD quality." Earlier this year, Apple CEO Steve Jobs called on the world's four major record companies to start selling songs online without copy-protection software. "We definitely think it's the right thing to do," Apple vice president of iTunes Eddy Cue said. "In this case, EMI's a leader and we think others will follow." Mr Jobs reiterated that Apple expected more than half of the 5 million songs on iTunes would feature a DRM-free version by the end of the year. In the meantime, Apple's iTunes Store will continue to offer songs in the same copy-protected format as today at US99c-per-download and encoded at 128kbps. The iTunes Plus versions are encoded at 256 kbps, which Apple says makes the audio quality on par with original recordings. Apple also will continue to encode its songs - including EMI's DRM-free content - in the AAC audio format, which could force some users to go through an extra step of converting tunes into a version that would be compatible with their players. Some gadgets don't support AAC, including SanDisk's newest Sansa Connect or Samsung Electronics's YP-K3, but IDC analyst Susan Kevorkian said she expected support for AAC would widen following Apple's move. Amazon.com, by comparison, said it planned to sell songs online later this year in the DRM-free MP3 format - the popular unrestricted audio standard that is supported by virtually any device, including Apple's best-selling iPod. The next generation of digital music will be untethered from usage restrictions, Ms Kevorkian predicted. It would be something major music labels other than EMI would have to do if they want to combat the industry's years long decline of music CD sales, she said. "They absolutely have to reach the internet to drive music sales, and part of that is to remove the hurdle that comes with the lack of interoperability," Ms Kevorkian said.

NASA wants the Russian module upgraded to meet US safety standards. Two Russian crew members have ventured out from the International Space Station to install metal shields designed to protect the vulnerable research outpost from the impact of orbital debris. Station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov floated out of an airlock on the Russian side of the station at 3.05pm EDT (7.05am NZ time), about an hour later than planned due to a glitch with communications equipment. They were back inside about five and a half hours later. During the outing, the cosmonauts fitted five aluminium debris impact shields to the forward part of the crew's living quarters, a Russian-built module known as Zvezda that has been in orbit seven years. The shields measuring about 60cms by 90cms and weigh between 6.8 and 9kgs. Yurchikhin and Kotov also rerouted cables for satellite navigation equipment that will be needed when Europe's unmanned cargo ship makes its debut flight to the station later this year. NASA wants the Russian module upgraded to meet US safety standards. It was launched despite the substandard shielding after Russia and the United States agreed to upgrade the structure once it was in orbit. That work began in 2002, but was interrupted by the 2003 Columbia disaster and subsequent grounding of the space shuttle fleet. The bulk of the shields were delivered during NASA's last shuttle mission to the outpost in December 2006. At 28,162 kmh, even something as small as a fleck of paint can cause severe damage to the station. An impact with orbital debris "is our biggest risk," said Kirk Shireman, NASA's space station deputy programme manager. During the spacewalk, the cosmonauts attached five of the 17 remaining panels. The rest of the shields will be installed during a spacewalk slated for June 6. Other shielding upgrades to Russian-made station components are pending. If all the improvements are made, the chance a piece of debris or a micrometeoroid would puncture the outpost drops to 29 percent from 55 percent over the station's expected 15-year life, according to an independent task force report published in February that studied the issue for NASA and Congress. Construction of the $US100 billion ($NZ138.86 billion), 16-nation project is scheduled for completion in 2010, at which time the shuttle fleet is to be retired. Also on Wednesday, NASA managers began a two-day meeting at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida to determine if shuttle Atlantis is ready to resume flying. The shuttle's fuel tank was hammered in a February hail storm, delaying the US space agency's first mission of the year for three months. The shuttle and a crew of seven astronauts are now scheduled for liftoff on June 8.

The walk by commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov was scheduled to last six hours. The station&#039;s third occupant, U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams, remained inside. "O.K.!" Yurchikhin said as he opened the hatch. Space debris includes discarded rocket parts, planetary dust and rocks. Scientists consider it the greatest threat to the space station orbiting about 220 miles (354 kilometers) above Earth. Engineers on the ground are able to monitor by radar the largest pieces of space debris &#8212; objects larger than a softball &#8212; and adjust the station&#039;s position accordingly, so the shielding will protect against smaller objects. Bush urges 15 major countries set global emission goal by 2008 Zoellick has new agenda for World Bank Bush calls on Congress to increase funds for fighting AIDS "The consequence of small particles is not so great," said Kirk Shireman, NASA&#039;s deputy program manager for the space station. "Then there are the midrange particles. Those are the ones we worry about." The spacewalk started about 45 minutes late, but a bright moon allowed the cosmonauts to catch up by working through what normally would have been darkness after orbital sunsets. The space station circles the Earth every 90 minutes. The 17 protective panels each are about 2 feet (0.6 meters) by 3 feet (0.9 meters) and weigh about 20 pounds (9 kilograms). The cosmonauts also planned to fix a navigation antenna that will be used later in the year for the first flight of a new European cargo vehicle, and they intended to deposit canisters containing biological experiments outside the station. Yurchikhin and Kotov will perform another spacewalk next Wednesday with similar tasks.

http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-whales31may31,0,5041629.story%3Fcoll%3Dla-home-center&cid Once-wayward humpbacks appear to be home free - Los Angeles Times 9:56 AM PDT, Sell & More Deals at Local Stores California | Local News Once-wayward humpbacks appear to be home free With no whales in sight, experts assume that the mother and calf have safely made it back to the Pacific. By Eric Bailey, Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTO &#8212; They came, they wandered, they went. After a 17-day sojourn in Northern California's inland waterways, two wayward humpback whales that caught the attention of the nation appear to have quietly slipped back into the Pacific Ocean. By late Wednesday, nearly 24 hours after they were last sighted off the Marin County town of Tiburon, the mother and her calf were nowhere to be seen. Most of the experts mounting a rescue operation concluded that the pair had found their way back to their ocean home. A pair of patrol boats from the U.S. Coast Guard and California Department of Fish and Game hunted the waters off the coast for any sign of the pair, while vessels crisscrossing San Francisco Bay were asked to notify authorities of any sighting. Not a tail slap, spout or sky-scratching breach was seen. "They arrived here quietly, and if they've made their way outside the Golden Gate, they've gone out quietly," said Bernadette Fees, a state Fish and Game spokeswoman. First spotted swimming languidly May 13, the pair arrived in the Sacramento River sporting deep gashes likely inflicted by a run-in with a ship. They wandered into a deep-water shipping channel and into the Port of Sacramento, meandering 70 miles from the sea. In the days that followed, whale experts from around the nation descended on the area to lend a hand. The rescue team received thousands of e-mails and calls from the public, expressing concern and offering suggestions. Northern Californians took off workdays to perch on riverbank levees to get a glimpse. Experts faced a tough balance between giving the whales room to relax and heal and trying to persuade them to head back to their natural saline environment, where their wounds would better heal. The rescue team used clanking pipes, recordings of killer whales and even the geyser spray of a fireboat in an unsuccessful bid to prod the whales past what became their biggest obstacle &#8212; a bustling bridge at Rio Vista. Scientists grew worried late last week as the pair's health continued to deteriorate. By the weekend, the team resorted to administering a dose of antibiotics &#8212; a first for whales in the wild &#8212; delivered with foot-long syringes shot from a .22-caliber rifle. They prepared to launch a massive post-Memorial Day push to move the whales. The whales beat them to the punch. On Sunday, they made their break amid the buzz of holiday jet skiers and boaters on the river. Over three days, they moved purposefully down the river, through the narrow Carquinez Strait and into San Francisco Bay. Seeming to gain vigor, the 20-foot-long juvenile put on a display of leaps and tail slaps as if at play. Tara Cahn, a Sausalito architect, jumped in her car upon learning that the whales were swimming along the Marin County coast. After a few wrong turns, she finally tracked them down Tuesday evening about a quarter-mile offshore of Tiburon. "They were bouncing around, they were playing, they were spouting," said Cahn, who on Wednesday was out looking for them again. "I've been whale watching on Monterey Bay, and this was far more exciting." Scientists say the pair's health rebounded after they returned to the bay's soothing saltwater. Their skin, which grew pitted during their trip up the Sacramento River, was looking slick and slippery by Tuesday evening. "We're still holding our breath a little bit, but we're just so pleased," said Trevor Spradlin, a marine mammal biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, the federal agency that helped lead the rescue effort. Spradlin said scientists are coming away with a treasure trove of insights and observations that will fuel months of research. "We will rigorously and systematically document this case. Really, the only other reference point was Humphrey, and that was a long time ago," he said, referring to the wayward humpback that spent nearly a month in the delta in 1985.

Published: May 28, 2007, 10:35 PM PDT TOKYO--Toshiba said it would buy microprocessors from Advanced Micro Devices, ending its exclusive ties with Intel for its supply of chips, and sending its shares higher. Toshiba, the world's fourth-largest laptop PC maker, said Tuesday it expects to put AMD processors in about 20 percent of the notebooks it sells in the United States and Europe. The move follows an announcement last year by Dell, which had been procuring microprocessors only from Intel for more than two decades, that it would begin using chips from AMD Intel is AMD's far larger rival with a market share of around 80 percent. Gates, Jobs share stage, memories Why Google shows developers the love Will labels hum along with DRM-free iTunes? Extra: Sci-fi writers join war on terror "With PCs becoming commodity products, there seems to be a new way of thinking that competition should be introduced even in procurement of such core parts like processors as long as there are no major differences in product specifications," Macquarie Securities analyst Yoshihiro Shimada said. "This could be a message that an era in which Intel took the lion's share of microprocessor profits as the king of PC chips is over." Toshiba plans to put AMD chips in moderate-priced standard models for individual and corporate clients, Toshiba spokeswoman Yuko Sugahara said. The Nikkei business daily reported earlier that prices of AMD-equipped PCs are expected to sell for up to 10,000 yen ($82) less than comparable models. Toshiba will install AMD chips in some models to be released this summer, enabling it to reduce parts-procurement costs by at least 10 percent, the paper said. . All rights reserved.

Staff Writer, CNET News.com Published: May 31, 2007, 9:07 AM PDT Alleged spam mogul Robert Alan Soloway was arrested on Wednesday after being indicted by a federal grand jury. Washington State Office of the Attorney General has dubbed the Seattle Spammer was given an August 6 trial, during which he is set to face 35 charges related to suspected fraudulent Internet activities. Soloway, owner of Newport Internet Marketing, was indicted by a federal grand jury on May 23 in a U.S. District Court in Seattle on 10 counts of mail fraud, 5 counts of wire fraud, 2 counts of e-mail fraud, 5 counts of aggravated identity theft and 13 counts of money laundering. Soloway pleaded not guilty to all charges on Wednesday at his arraignment, according to court documents. The indictment is a culmination of an investigation collaboratively conducted by the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation unit, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property units of the Department of Justice, according to the U.S. Attorney's office. "Spam is a scourge of the Internet, and Robert Soloway is one of its most prolific practitioners. Our investigators dubbed him the Spam King because he is responsible for millions of spam e-mails," Jeffrey Sullivan, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington, said in a statement. Soloway is being accused of operating false Web sites and more than 50 domains, through which he posed as an advertiser offering legitimate "broadcast e-mail services" with "permission-based opt-in e-mail addresses." He allegedly deceived legitimate businesses into buying marketing software and services that turned out to be spam tools. Businesses that complained were met with intimidation and threats, according to the allegations against Soloway. Gates, Jobs share stage, memories Why Google shows developers the love Will labels hum along with DRM-free iTunes? Extra: Sci-fi writers join war on terror The alleged spammer is also accused of creating more than 2,000 proxy computers, or botnets--computers hijacked by hackers to send spam--and of using stolen e-mail and domain names that led to others' ISP addresses being blocked and those victims accused of being originating spammers. The trial is set to go before Judge Marsha Pechman, with a detention hearing prior to that on June 4 before Judge James Donohue. Until then, Soloway is scheduled to remain in custody. Soloway, whose assets have been forfeited by the U.S. government, was also appointed a public defender Wednesday. While Soloway is being charged for alleged actions between November 2003 and May 2007, he incorporated Newport Internet Marketing, or NIM, in 1998 in California. Soloway moved his organization to Oregon in 2000 and then again to Seattle in 2003, where he has been living ever since.

You thought it had been replaced by the anti-evolutionary âScienceâ of âIntelligent Design,â considered by some a more difficult target for the rational thinkers of our society (theist and non-theist alike) to attack, huh? Well, you were wrong. The Creation Museum open[ed] in Petersburg, Kentucky on May 28. Designed by a former Universal Studios exhibit director, they do have the theatrics right. For in nearby Tennessee, the famous Scopes Trial, the subject of the play "Inherit the Wind," was held in 1925. Some thought the trial disposed of creationism as something other than a religious story, but think again, folks. It's baaaack, with a vengeance. As the museum's president, Kenneth Ham of "Answers in Genesis-USA," said ("Biblical creation museum to rise in Kentucky in 2007" Michael Powell, Washington Post, 9/27/05): " âEvolutionary Darwinists need to understand we are taking the dinosaurs back. . . . This is a battle cry to recognize the science in the revealed truth of God. . . [In] the post-Flood world dinosaurs lived with man.' [The museum presents the view that] the world and the universe are but 6,000 years old and that baby dinosaurs rode in Noah's ark." As Powell said further: "Creationists believe man became mortal when God cast Adam and Eve out of Eden 6,000 years ago. Death did not exist before that." And there was Mr. (perhaps Dr.) Ham, larger than life on the Fox"News"Channel (where else?) at 7:25 p.m. EDT, on May 21. As Ham said back in 2005 (actually 45 ten-thousandths of the total time the Earth has existed, don't you know) in the Washington Post article: "the Bible is the literal word of God and He created the universe in seven days. . . . We admit we have an axiom: We have a book and it's the Bible and it's revealed history. Where the Bible teaches on science, we can trust it as the word of God." On the F"N"C, he claimed everything presented in the museum is supported by "science." When asked about the importance of the museum, he said words to the effect of: "Creationism proves that God exists and that the Bible is His word. For without the Bible and [its version of] God, there would be no morality." The existence of this museum and the highly pro-active organization behind it (according to Powell, there are about a half dozen creationist organizations and museums in the U.S.) raises some fascinating questions. What, pray tell, is Answers in Genesis-USA's definition of science? Ham kept talking about "observation." (I have a friend who visited a remote part of Utah and told me with great earnestness that she had seen for her own eyes the proof of "Noah's Flood.") "Science," as evolutionary biologists, geologists, etc. define it, is quite something else. But it would be most useful to know what the Creationists think that it is. How do we know exactly what the original Bible had to say about creation? The version used by folks such as Answers in Genesis-USA is one particular English translation (the so-called King James version) of a Latin translation of a Greek translation of a Hebrew translation of an Aramaic (and perhaps other languages) text. Why should we believe the Creation Story to which Answers in Genesis-USA refer is the correct one? The story is also told in the Jewish Torah, but it has important differences from that told in the King James version, like the concept of original sin. Further, the other major non-Mosaic religions, such as Hinduism, have completely different creation stories. And then the traditional culture creation stories, like those of the New Zealand Maori people and the various Central American peoples, Aztecs, Mayans, are all quite different. Even if the Earth is only 6,000-10,000 years old, what is the science supporting the view that the story Answers in Genesis-USA refers to is the correct one? And then we have to go the "One God" hypothesis. Just how many, one has to wonder, "One Gods" are there? Among the Mosaic religions, there are the Catholic, multiple Protestant, several Muslim, and multiple Jewish versions. Then there are the Buddhists, whose version of "God," in the eyes of many Buddhists, isn't really very "God-like" in the Western sense. There is the major polytheistic religion still with us, Hinduism. How do we know for sure, scientifically according to the "science" of Answers in Genesis-USA, that theirs is not the correct concept of the unknown up there somewhere. As one wag once asked, "just how many âOne Gods' are there? It could actually be very crowded in the âone Godâ space." It would seem there are a bunch of questions that "Creation Science" needs to answer before one even begins to evaluate the evidence that they present that their version of how human beings came to be is correct, or not.

Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov - crew members of the 15th expedition to the orbital station - installed five aluminum panels in the Russian section of the ISS to reduce the risk of damage by small debris and meteoroid impact, a problem raised in an independent safety task force report February. "The cosmonauts succeeded in performing the task," a Mission Control spokesperson said. In the spacewalk that lasted more than five hours, the cosmonauts used a crane to move stakes of panels from the U.S. section, where they had been delivered to on board space shuttles, and are expected to install the remaining 12 panels during their next spacewalk scheduled for June 6. In addition, Yurchikhin and Kotov rerouted a cable for a navigation antenna, while the third crewmember, U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams, remained inside. During next week&#39;s spacewalk, the cosmonauts will also place a canister with biologic experiments outside the station. Thursday is to see a final decision by NASA on whether to give a go-ahead to its Atlantis space shuttle liftoff to the ISS scheduled for June 8. The launch was postponed from mid-March after a hailstorm damaged the insulating foam on the spacecraft&#39;s tank.

MCN Local Cable Advertising Sales MCN Hispanic Television Update MCN Telco IP Update Move Also Raises Competitive Stakes to Cable By Gary Arlen -- Multichannel News, 5/31/2007 11:40:00 AM Of all the alliances Apple could create to deliver Internet video to the living room via its new Apple TV set-top box, the choice of YouTube was a typically audacious move if only because it accelerates the media presence of YouTube&#8217;s parent, Google, with its well-known voracious media appetite. Although the deal adds another &#8220;coolness&#8221; factor to Apple TV (as if that were needed), it also enhances the credibility of Web-delivered TV as a video-on-demand competitor to legacy providers, including cable operators. In announcing the Apple TV/YouTube package, Apple CEO made it clear that this is just one -- for now, the biggest -- of many alternative video packages that will be available via his new device to deliver Internet video to conventional TV receivers. &#8220;We&#8217;ve wanted to do this for a few years,&#8221; Jobs said. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing the variety of what you can get,&#8221; he added, using a term that he repeated at least three times to describe the opportunities of Apple&#8217;s latest digital initiatives. To underscore his competitive attitude toward the cable industry, Jobs casually observed that cable providers &#8220;use that very strange software called &#8216; .&#8217;&#8221; He added that Apple could &#8220;not see a go-to-market strategy&#8221; that makes use of such technology. Jobs suggested that Apple TV is comparable with the DVD player, which was the fastest-selling home-video device in consumer-electronics history. &#8220;We want to be the DVD player for the Internet age,&#8221; Jobs said. As he demonstrated examples of YouTube short clips at The Wall Street Journal D5: All Things Digital conference in suburban San Diego Wednesday, the challenges of Internet video became clear -- and, in some cases, blurry. When displayed on a 100-inch screen, the often-fuzzy amateur videos occasionally became painful to watch. Although the content itself was compelling, many in the audience -- including session moderator &#8217;s host -- wondered if viewers would tolerate the grainy, shaky visuals on their expensive, new digital monitors at home. One of the videos, a &#8220;human sling shot&#8221; with a bungee-cord-like launch from a lawn tractor, generated plenty of guffaws from the tech-savvy D5 audience, but the production values, especially as seen on the huge screen, defined a watch-it-once experience. Such nitpicking, however, begs the question, since YouTube and other emerging short-form video distributors are looking for more professional content for their Internet-video services. A D5 speaker prior to Jobs, CBS CEO , pointed out that his company hired a &#8220;band of kids&#8221; to create series of short-form programs, intended for Web video (although not necessarily for Apple TV). Plenty of other high-quality productions are in the pipeline from other professional sources. Jobs noted that Apple TV will be able to carry HD video, adding another competitive element to the set-top wars. He offered no details. In his demonstration, Jobs highlighted new features of Apple TV navigation, including software that will be available for download in June to access YouTube and future content. A stylized version of the YouTube menu screen is available. An on-screen virtual keyboard (that is, an alphabet grid) requires users to move up, down, left and right via the remote control to type words when searching for a specific video. Curiously, the demonstrated version did not include predictive typing, which would narrow the choices for the next letter in each sequence and bring up titles more easily. That may be a function of limited capability in the Apple TV processor, but Jobs did not address such technical details. Jobs also skirted any discussion of revenue models for Apple TV and its new and future content partners. The YouTube gauntlet allows Apple to move into the living room and, at the same time, take a smack at Microsoft, which has never fully conquered that turf despite the billions of dollars it has spent on cable-TV and telephone-company-TV ventures. Microsoft&#8217;s games products have successfully attained living-room presence, but even that product&#8217;s evolving broadband-access capability has not stirred the buzz Apple TV is creating. Never in his remarks at D5 did Jobs draw a connection between Apple TV and the even-more-highly-awaited . Apple&#8217;s CEO spent plenty of time discussing the new mobile phone, which will be exclusively offered in the United States on AT&#38;T&#8217;s wireless system. Given the competitive nature of phone and cable companies -- and AT&#38;T&#8217;s U-verse IPTV agenda -- it appears likely that Apple and AT&#38;T will devise arrangements that converge the applications of iPhone and Apple TV. In particular, the vaunted ability to control a set-top box, including setting up access or even remote viewing (akin to capabilities) could become part of a multipurpose service. Since Motorola&#8217;s &#8220;connected home&#8221; and various Cisco/Scientific Atlanta plans envision similar services for cable operators, the aggressive Apple agenda takes on greater competitive implications. Jobs&#8217; comment on a seemingly unrelated topic, the use of portable devices, certainly raised the prospect for such services. &#8220;Video is here to stay on portable devices; it will grow,&#8221; said the man in the black turtleneck and jeans -- an iconic prototype of the &#8220;Mac guy&#8221; in Apple&#8217;s TV commercials.

"This layer will remain in place as our teams work together toward further integrating this amazing content, generated by many, into our mapping technologies." Panoramio co-founder Eduardo Manch&oacute;n said "We are very (and we mean very) happy to announce that Panoramio will be acquired by Google." "We have tightened our relationship with Google Earth more and more in recent months, and at the end we decided to walk one step further. After so much work together, honestly, we couldn&rsquo;t imagine a better scenario than selling Panoramio to Google," he added. "Most people upload their photos to Panoramio to share them through Google Earth, and it&rsquo;s way cool to see Panoramio&rsquo;s photos in Google Earth, so the upcoming acquisition reaffirms the current win-win situation."

http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/jobs-and-gates-together-at-last/2007/05/31/1180205412334.html&cid Jobs and Gates, together at last - Technology - smh.com.au Welcome to The Sydney Morning Herald. Jobs and Gates, together at last File photos of Bill Gates and (inset) Steve Jobs 5:06PM "You and I have memories, longer than the road that stretches out ahead." Apple CEO Steve Jobs chose that tender line from the timeless Beatles track to describe his relationship with Microsoft chairman Bill Gates when they appeared on stage together today for the first time in more than 20 years. It was just one of the countless adulations the pair poured on each other during their hotly anticipated 90-minute conversation at the D: All Things Digital conference in Carlsbad, California. Fireworks were expected, but nostalgia was the order of the day as the&#160;industry icons&#160;reflected on their joint history and pondered over the future of personal technology. To the ballroom of technology workers and the thousands of online followers who had tuned in to see Jobs and Gates go head to head, the tech titans appeared more like old mates than bitter rivals. The conversation, moderated by The Wall Street Journal 's Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, began with Swisher asking each what the other's biggest contribution to the computer industry was. "Bill built the first software company before anybody in our industry knew what software was, and that was huge," Jobs said. "Apple really pursued the dream of building products that we want to use ourselves," said Gates, adding that Jobs always seemed to figure out where the next industry movement would be. When asked what the greatest misunderstanding of their relationship was, Jobs joked: "We've kept our marriage secret for over a decade now." Gates added: "Neither of us have anything to complain about, in general. It's been fun to work together." Jobs wore his trademark black turtleneck, jeans and sneakers, while Gates was more formal, wearing a button down shirt, dress pants and shoes. It could have almost been a scene from one of Apple's "I'm a Mac, and i'm a PC" ads, minus the anti-PC sledging. "The art of those commercials isn't to be mean, it's for those guys to like each other," Jobs said when Swisher quizzed him on the ads. "PC guy is great, he's got a big heart." The mutual adulation and banter was interspersed with reflections on the early days of the personal computing industry, when Microsoft and Apple worked far more closely together. "Let me tell the story!" Jobs jokingly quipped when Gates began recounting how the Apple II computer, first introduced in the '70s, used Microsoft software. Both Jobs and Gates agreed that computers - Macs and PCs - were not losing relevance in a world where applications were increasingly being accessed through the web browser. "The PC has been very resilient - its death has been predicted many times," Jobs said, after noting that desktop applications were far more powerful than web applications. The last time the pair made a joint public appearance was in 1997 at the Macworld convention in Boston - Gates was beamed in by teleconference, and he and Jobs announced that Microsoft had invested $US150 million in Apple. But no announcements came out of this joint appearance, with both sides getting those formalities out of the way earlier in the day. Apple announced its Apple TV device would begin playing YouTube videos, while Microsoft showed off its latest innovation - a coffee-table shaped computer that responds to touch and to special barcodes attached to everyday objects. send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today Jobs and Gates, together at last File photos of Bill Gates and (inset) Steve Jobs File photos of Bill Gates and (inset) Steve Jobs File photos of Bill Gates and (inset) Steve Jobs Place a classified ad Copyright &#169; 2007.

Palm Foleo: What were they thinking? Wednesday, May 30, 2007 22:45 Opinion &ndash; We see a lot of new hardware and software that often leaves us scratching our head what the purpose and market opportunity of that new product could be. Palm set high expectations with a new mobile device that was announced to describe a new mobile category &ndash; and Foleo left us speechless. Palm can&rsquo;t be serious about this one. Palm unveils Foleo (10 images) ... Jeff Hawkins is without doubt one of the smartest guys in Silicon Valley. It is largely because of his vision that the PDA category was created in the second half of the 1990s; he brought us the first the first tablet-PC like device in the late 1980s; he was the first one to commercialize a smartphone in the form factor we are used to today and he continues to help Palm define a direction in a market that gets more competitive every day. When Palm told us yesterday that Jeff Hawkins was about to announce a new mobile device in a category we weren&rsquo;t aware of until today, of course we made sure that we wouldn&rsquo;t miss the webcast presentation. And since Hawkins turns 50 on June 1, we expected something big. Kinda like a birthday present that he would give to himself. And boy, what a present that was. We believe that there is a good chance that he won&rsquo;t forget Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky after the announcement of the Handspring Visor PDA in 2000. This new product, called Foleo, turns out to be something that looks like a small laptop computer, but it doesn&rsquo;t act like one. In fact, its functionality is much closer to that of a smartphone, but you can&rsquo;t use it to make calls. So what is it? It is an extension to the smartphone, a device that enables Palm to pitch to you two $500 products instead of only one. Hawkins said that Foleo is light, it feels good in your hand and it has a large keyboard and 10&rdquo; screen that come in handy when you want to view those pictures, PDF or Powerpoint attachments and write emails that are longer than just ten words &ndash; which admittedly is a painful task on today&rsquo;s smartphones. So there really is an interesting thought in this and it has some unique features, such as the instant on/off, but $500 for a large screen and keyboard for your cellphone? For a device that can&rsquo;t do anything by itself (well, ok, you can browse the web and send/receive emails, if there&rsquo;s a Wi-Fi connection close by), and a device that you would have to bring along on your business trips in addition to your cellphone, your laptop and your iPod? I somewhat have the feeling that Palm will need a small miracle to turn the Foleo into commercial success. But let&rsquo;s just imagine for a moment that this category does succeed: What else could follow? Apple could create a video iPod companion. A $300 portable, DVD-player-like device without the capability to play DVDs, but to stream videos from the iPod via Wi-Fi (I still hope that we will see this feature in iPods this year) or from a Compact Flash card. Would you buy such a product? I am not so sure. Jeff Hawkins during the unveiling of the Treo smartphone at Comdex Fall 2001. Hawkins believes that there is a substantial market opportunity for Foleo, as - according to a market survey - 24.2 million people use their smartphones to send and receive emails. But realistically, not all of those users have Palm OS and Windows Mobile devices. There are many users who have Blackberrys, Symbian-based phones and the future will bring lots of people using iPhones &ndash; all of which will not be supported by the first version of the Foleo. Take all of those people out of the equation and then subtract from that all those people who have Treos and Windows PDA phones and do not need notebooks during their business trips. Suddenly that market does not look quite as big anymore. The software side is another problem area for the Foleo. Beyond email and web browsing, there isn&rsquo;t really anything the device can do. And even web browsing is somewhat limited, as the device isn&rsquo;t strong enough to play YouTube videos, we were told. Some other applications are there as well, but according to Hawkins, software such as an image viewer was thrown in because the application apparently was created more or less by accident by someone on the side and not necessarily with the Foleo in mind. Foleo could benefit from unique applications, but it is exactly this area that appears to have no direction. The hopes are on a developer community that Palm hopes will grow around Foleo. Will that be enough? Gee guys, why doesn&rsquo;t Foleo have a VoIP application built in to make Wi-Fi calls? The good thing about the device is that we don&rsquo;t know too much about its specifications yet and Palm has time to revise the product. For $500, a large keyboard and a large screen are not enough. Even a processor that can handle video playback, reasonable flash storage, GPS capability and battery life of more five hours would make Foleo look like a risky business proposition. But then, we all may be wrong and Hawkins will be able to once again turn his vision into a successful product. We just aren&rsquo;t convinced yet. What do you think? Would you buy the Foleo? How would you use it? Let us know and write a comment in the form below. This product, for me, would determine Palm's future... May 30, 2007 23:32 This product, for me, would determine Palm's future, after a string of delays and lacklustre products. This is the nail in the coffin. Palm is finished. May 30, 2007 23:34 I would never buy something like this, its just one more electronic that I don't need, like things like the iphone that combine an MP3 player and a Phone...I already have a MP3 player, and a cellphone, why spend another $600 to get them...both...again? Same goes for Folio, I have a Smartphone, and I have a Laptop, My laptop has wireless, and a big keyboard, plus it can browse the internet, my Smartphone is a smaller more limited version of my laptop, why would I spend another $500 for a Larger MORE limited version of my Smartphone? May 30, 2007 23:37 Well, there are a lot of people who may need it... but for $500, it is not really worth it... maybe if it was say about $99 or so, i would not mind tryin it... i am sure hawkins will bring out some changes in it with some time.. it is best to just wait and watch i guess... Remember the IBM WorkPad Z50? May 30, 2007 23:38 I do, because I bought one when it was being discontinued. Very much like the Foleo, albeit without the wireless option and based on Windows CE. Don't get me wrong -- I still use the Z50 on occasion, but it's nowhere near my primary device for contact management, etc. Palm must believe it can successfully target a niche market, but without powerful dedicated applications, it'll be an uphill climb. May 30, 2007 23:44 If it can do Goole Apps for Education I will buy hundreds of them for students...think of this as a potential Web 2/Web 3 device, just the right specs for grades 4-8. Between a laptop and a handheld - a tweener! What do I think? May 30, 2007 23:48 You captured everything I thought about the Foleo. I use a Treo and it is a horrible product. I always thought of Palm as a being a innovative company, always ahead of the game and that the masses would eventually catch up. But boy...What the F#$% were they thinking.... I can already do way MORE with my Windows Mobile (H... I can already do way MORE with my Windows Mobile (HTC) phone/pocket PC, which cost considerably less. If I really need a large keyboard & screen, it probably means I need to use full-size software, in which case I might as well just open up my laptop and be done with it. So very, very weak Let's see, for $500 I can buy a device that has no real purpose except to extend the functionality of my cell phone (a device I generally see as a necessary evil as it is). Hmm... No, I think not. The foleo is a nice idea, but it does nothing but make your smartphone bigger.. Who wants to have a larger screen if that is all it does.. no video capability? Not in todays world.. I like Palm and have purchased many of their products. But I just do not see this one being a good venture without many many fixes from the current design. Wi-Fi is a standard, five hour battery life, what good is that at my desk at work... keyboard? I could type with my thumbs without paying $500... not worth it palm....try again... Truly disappointing product. Palm could've knocked this out of the park with a market killer, but they came up with this. I own a Nokia E61 myself - integrated WiFi, QWERTY keyboard, GPRS / EDGE / UTMS, etc, ability to open / edit most MS-Office formats - and this is a product that was launched almost a year ago. To compete with the iPhone, the upcoming Nokia N95, the existing Treo 680 / 700 and the new range of Blackberrys - $500 is a lot of dollar for a product that is best "described" as a companion / add-on Toshiba had the Libretto. Nobody bought it. And probably for the same reasons. When I want a portable device, I want to be able to put it somewhere, like in a pocket, on my belt, or (in the case of my Abacus PalmOS watch) on a wristband. When I don't care about portability, I use a fullsized notebook. Where does this fit? Foleo -- A sinking ship Personally, I would say that if the device is released by Palm as it has been described in this article, without a serious overhaul and a huge amount of additional functionality, interface-ability and interactivity added to it, it's going to wind up being an even bigger and faster flop than Sony's ill-starred PSP. Palm finally lost the plot People would have to be crazy to buy the Foleo. It's like dragging a laptop around that doesn't do anything useful. My daughter has a Fujitsu 10&#189;" widescreen ultraportable notebook that is the same size as the Foleo, but it's a real computer, not some toy. If you are going to cart around something of that size, get the Fujitsu or Asus tiny notebook. I use a HP 6828 PDA-phone and it probably does EVERYTHING that the Foleo and an accompanying smartphone can do, but it fits into my shirt pocket. I run three businesses from that PDA-phone and it syncs to my desktop when I'm in my office. How good is that? Why would a Blackberry or O2A Atom user change over to a Foleo? They'd have to be crazy. Palm has finally lost the plot. I used a Palm Professional when US Robotics owned the company and it was fantastic for its day. But the Palm OS was killed by the Windows-based PDAs and Palm has never recovered. The Foleo might be the final nail in Palm's coffin. Only if you could dial with it and it had bluetooth, so you could leave it in your pocket until needed The device is obviously for business where you do not need more than writing and answering email and browsing the net (blackberry?). The downside is it cannot make phone calls but the up side is that it's fast and easy to write your mails and to just check something small on the net. The above mentioned two positives (read keyboard and big screen/internet) makes the device more efficient and in a way fixes what a smart phone lacks. If it's light and has good practical battery time I'd say we have a winner. Of course I'm still talking about business. I'm A Business Owner of 2 Companies Someone mentioned that this is for business use. No way. I run 2 companies and wouldn't consider such a device for myself or any of my employees. I don't know any professional that would consider such a product unless they got it free at a convention show. Years ago I bought one of those Motorola StarTac cellphones - they were about $400-$600 when they first came out because they were tiny. Motorola sold an attachable electronic organizer with a bigger screen. I bought it because it attached directly to my cellphone. If I had to carry it as a 2nd device, I would have never considered it. To think this guy makes big bucks to come up with 1 cent ideas. I'm pretty sure that you can do everything that this device promise to do, with the laptop/notebook/sub-notebook you already have, and better. Why spend the money and carry the extra gadget? Great 2nd Web browser for homes (at $99) I think this thing is GREAT... if it was $99 - $150 and was marketted as a spare, portable, web browsing machine for homes with existing WIFI. But no one in their right mind would pay $500 - $600 for this underpowered laptop. Really.. how much could it cost for some chinese firm to put out a simple, light laptop just for wifi web browsing, but include a cheap say 20GB hd (keep the flash so it is still instant on). Or at the current price point, add a pc card slot and an evdo modem and that 20GB hd or a second SD slot. (so you can browse anywhere and save your data better). I think it has potential. It is a deffinitely a niche market item. Since it has wifi, it would be great for internet cafes and other similar places. How is this possible?

Get expert advice, forms and more. : It's a high-tech world - - we just plug you into it... Palm Inc. has unveiled a small, laptop-like digital device intended as a companion to multipurpose cell phones. The new Foleo features a 10-inch screen, a full keyboard and wireless syncing capabilities that will enable users to harness the computing power, e-mail ability and Internet access of their smart phones. Palm founder Jeff Hawkins, who showed off the device Wednesday at the D: All Things Digital conference, said the Foleo is intended for smart-phone users who have been itching for a way to view and edit e-mail on a more expansive and comfortable device. "This is the most exciting product I've worked on in a long time -- in fact, ever," Hawkins said. "It really completes the vision of Palm. It really shows you how you can get to a great, simple personal computing experience with mobile devices." But some analysts were skeptical, saying the company, which has been hard-pressed to follow up on the success of its Treo line of phones, seems to have struck out with the Foleo. Despite record sales in the most-recent quarter, Palm posted a 61 percent drop in profit as it struggled to compete with larger rivals like Research In Motion and Nokia. The increasing competition has prompted some investors to call for a sale of Palm to a larger company or at least the development of a breakthrough product to re-energize the company's lineup. Analyst Todd Kort with Gartner Research said the Foleo is not likely to be that standout product. "I think it's the most disappointing product I've encountered in several years, considering all the secrecy and hype we've gotten about it," Kort said. "Basically, the thing is way too big and heavy. You won't take this thing around as an adjunct to a phone." Hawkins, however, touted the benefits of the 2 1/2-pound Foleo, saying it will find an audience, starting with mobile e-mail users. The device, which works on the Linux operating system, will be in summer at $499 after a $100 rebate. It will feature Wi-Fi, an SD card slot, USB port, room for a compact flash card, an Opera Web browser and the ability to sync with smart phones using Bluetooth technology. Users will be able to view all their smart phone mobile e-mail accounts on the Foleo, as well attachments and PDF files, using a program called Documents To Go. Edits made on the Foleo will instantly transfer to the smart phone, and vice versa. The device, with a five-hour running time on battery power, can be turned on and off instantly without a warm-up or power-down period. The Foleo can be paired with Palm Treos and smart phones running a Windows Mobile operating system, although Palm hopes to make the device available in the future for BlackBerrys, phones like those from Nokia that run on a Symbian operating system and even Apple's iPhone. The Foleo only syncs e-mail accounts from Pocket Outlook for Windows Mobile and Versamail, with hopes of adding more e-mail systems in the future, Hawkins said. Palm's new device is not intended to replace a laptop computer, Hawkins said. Indeed, its small processor isn't suited for that or even for properly viewing Internet video. But he said that as the device evolves and takes on new applications, it can expand its reach into new areas. "You can do an awful lot with this product," he said. "We expect clever people to expand on that, and we look forward to where that takes us." Jack Gold, an analyst at J. Gold Associates, questioned how many people will be interested in carrying around another device, especially one with a large price tag that lacks laptop abilities such as Microsoft Office software or a multimedia player. "This is one of those 'tweener devices that I don't know who will buy it," Gold said. "Rather than spending time on this thing, they should have updated the Treo to make it more competitive with BlackBerrys and Nokias." Palm's stock finished up 42 cents, or 2.6 percent, at $16.60 on Wednesday.

John McCain Talks Tech at D Blogging on a Plane Google Calendar Gets Mobile The 100 Best Products Google Universal Search: Intriguing and Confusing More Google Searchology: More New Features Wednesday, May 30, 2007 Posted by Harry McCracken Bill and Steve: Together Again Time for the most-hyped session at D: All Things Digital: The semi-historic onstage interview of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Who together make up one of the most amazing facts in the history of personal technology: They've been at the heart of it for more than three decades now. First, some classic footage, including a 1983 Apple promotional parody of the Dating Game in which Gates extols the virtues of the Mac. Both men enter, along with the Wall Street Journal's Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher. Handshakes all around. Swisher asks each to talk about the other's impact on the industry. Jobs credits Gates for founding the first software company; Gates mentions the vision shown by the Apple II and Mac, Jobs' taste and class, and how he revived a dying company when he returned. Jobs mentions the companies' cofounders (Woz and Paul Allen) and all the other talented people who made their successes possible. Mossberg mentions there was Microsoft software in the Apple II--Gates and Jobs talk about Microsoft BASIC and how it helped the II. And then Microsoft's role in the early days of the Mac. "What people don't remember is that Microsoft wasn't in the applications business then," says Jobs, pointing out that Lotus was the big app company of the day. "We made this bet that the paradigm shift would be the graphical interface, and particularly that the Mac would make that happen," says Gates. They discuss the challenge of squeezing the original Mac system into 128KB, and bicker about whether the OS itself took up 14KB or around 20KB. "Bill and his team did some great work," says Jobs of the early Microsoft apps for the Mac, such as the first version of Excel. Next, discussion of why Microsoft deemphasized Mac activity--Gates says that during Jobs's exile, Apple lost its lead in graphical interfaces. Gates says he'd been talking to former Apple CEO Gil Amelio when Jobs returned; the mere mention of Amelio's job prompts snickers from the audience. "Gil had a saying," says Jobs. "Apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom, and my job is to get it pointed in the right direction." Major yuks form the audience. Mossberg says he doesn't want to get into the whole story of Jobs's return. "Thank you," says Steve. They discuss the Apple-Microsoft detente that was achieved after Jobs returned to the company. Jobs says there was no benefit to the company squabbling. "There were too many people in the Apple ecosystem playing a game of, 'For Apple to win, Microsoft must lose,'" says Jobs. "To me, it was essential to break that paradigm." "So I called Bill up and we tried to patch things up," says Jobs. And Gates explains that since then, there's been a Microsoft team dedicated to the Mac. Jobs says it's been a great relationship. Jobs says that "the art of those [Mac and PC] commercials is not to be mean, but for the two guys to like each other." Gates doesn't seem to be convinced that they're not meant to be mean. Laughs all around. Mossberg says that Microsoft is a much larger company in more markets than Apple. It thinks about Google and Linux and Sony and other competitors. "How often is Apple on your radar screen at Microsoft in a business sense?" Gates says the Zune team "loves the fact that Apple has created a giant market, and they're going to come in and try to contribute something." Mossberg says that the Xbox was developed in part on Mac systems, and Gates talks about how the Xbox adopted the Power PC at the same time that Apple was abandoning it. So yes, the Xbox 360 was developed on the Mac." "And we never ran an ad on that," says Jobs. "Steve is known for his restraint," Gates retorts. Jobs returns to a theme of his appearance earlier today: Apple is a software company that happens to make hardware. "There aren't a lot of us left, and Microsoft is another one." Mossberg talks about how Apple has always integrated hardware and software, and notes that Microsoft has been doing something similar with Xbox and Zune and the new Surface table. Jobs quotes visionary Alan Kay: "People who love software want to do their own hardware." Gates says that in the early stages of development, you want to do hardware and software together. But in a market as big as, say, phones, you can't do everything, and you can't scale to become huge, if you try to do all the hardware yourself. "Apple does what works super-great for them," says Gates. And Microsoft will take that approach with certain products, but not everything. Jobs follows up by saying that except for Windows, "it's hard to see examples of the hardware and software being decoupled working super well....it might with phones." But it's too early to tell. Mossberg asks Jobs if there was anything he could have done at any point to give the Mac bigger market share. Jobs says he has no regrets and mostly thinks about tomorrow. Swisher asks what Gates and Jobs think of the market right now. "I think it's super-healthy," says Jobs, saying there are a lot of exciting new companies. Gates agrees, talking about new interfaces and coupling of the Net and the local machine to do interesting things. "We'll look back at this as one of the great periods of invention." Mossberg says that both companies are heavily invested in the Net, but on another level they both represent the rich desktop client. Some people think that the platform's migrating to the cloud and you won't need a powerful computer. "In five years is the personal computer still going to be the linchpin of all this stuff?" Gates points out that the network computer came and went. "The mainstream is always under attack." He says you need a lot of power locally for rich interfaces, voice, etc. "There are lighterweight hardware Internet connections." But you can't do everything on the Net. Jobs says that he loves Google Maps, but when they wanted to put it on the iPhone, it needed to be a client app written by Apple. "The app we wrote blows away any Google Maps client...it's way better than the computer...and it's because of a lot of technology on the client....You can't do that stuff in a browser." Net-based apps are getting richer, "but it's happening fairly slowly..there are still pretty cool things you can do with clients." Jobs says that mixing rich client apps with Net services "is a very powerful marriage." Gates talks about the responsiveness of a local app compared to a Web service. Swisher asks what folks' principal computing devices will look like in five years. Mossberg says it might look like a tablet PC, even though tablets haven't been a hit. Gates says that current tablets are "like Windows 1992." Gates predicts that people will have both something fairly laptop-like and a device that fits in their pocket. "Those are natural form factors." At home, you'll have some sort of device for entertainment in the living room, and something in the den that looks like a desktop. Projectors will turn every surface into a computing environment. Mossberg expresses concern at screens everywhere; Gates says there won't be any in the bathroom. Jobs says that the PC--be it Windows and Mac--has proven "to be very resilient." They "kind of plateaued and got stale for awhile," and then the Internet made things interesting again. And then the PC because a digital hub for your life--and now there's something interesting going on with Net services. He believes that the PC, in some form, will survive. But focused "post-PC devices" like the iPod and phones and Zunes are going "to be very innovative." Mossberg asks if smartphones aren't really just computers in a new form factor. "We're getting to the point where is a ocmputer in a new form factor," responds Jobs. "So what? ...it's what you do with it." Gates says it's hard to figure out when all the portable gadgets in your life coalesce into one pocketable gadget. And even then, you won't want to edit documents on it, unless it has some sort of roll-out screen. Mossberg says the first D show had an e-ink demonstration--"it's always five years out." Jobs says he doesn't know what pocket-sized gadgets will look like in five years--five years ago, he wouldn't have thought today's phones would do maps. And there's a lot of innovation going on. Swisher asks what tech advances excite Gates and Jobs outside of computing. Jobs says Apple is working on exciting stuff it can't talk about. They're working on things that solve problems that people know they have. Mossberg says that iTunes is a big Internet business, and mentions .Mac and says a lot of people feel it hasn't developed. Jobs agrees and promises "we'll make up for lost time in the near future." Walt then asks if Microsoft worries about not being as nimble as smaller companies. Gates says there's lots of good stuff coming out of little companies. He says that Microsoft wants to do more with search. He talks about how video streaming can improve education, a dream that goes back to the start of the industry. It takes a whole ecosystem to make that happen. "I look at this a little bit differently," says Jobs, saying that there's a lot Apple doesn't try to do, since it can't do everything. It finds great partners--it doesn't even try to do search or maps. "We want to be that consumer's device...with a wonderful user interface in a coherent product." Sometimes that means building something from scratch, as with iTunes, but not always. Swisher asks about the fact that both Microsoft and Apple have become entertainment companies. Gates says that Microsoft is really about technology and building entertainment delivery vehicles, not entertainment itself. It's taken a long time to build that infrastructure. Mossberg asks Jobs if Apple, which launched the YouTube feature for Apple TV today, similarly sees itself as an enabler of entertainment. Jobs says that it's great for entertainment companies when more people want to enjoy their content in more ways, "but the transitions are difficult sometimes." "Hollywood, I think, has watched what's happened in music and learned some things to do, and some things not to do." The industry's offering consumers more choices, and some good stuff is happening. Mossberg says that Vista has come out and is the best Windows yet, and that Leopard is on its way. He's saying that both "are still built on what you started with--what Xerox did research on." He's asking if a new paradigm might be on its way in the next five years. Gates says that people have been thinking that 3D might change everything. It hasn't yet, but with maps, interesting things are happening with 3D on PCs. You might see online stores use 3D to show books on shelves. Mossberg asks about multi-touch input, as seen in both the iPhone and Microsoft's Surface table, as well as an HP display here at D. "Will this make its way into mainstream laptop computers?" "Software is doing vision," says Gates. He talks about Wii-like games involving swinging baseball bats--except they could involve bat, not a game controller. Mossberg responds that both his Vista laptop and his Mac laptop aren't that much different from PCs ten years ago. Gates talks about touch, speech, and vision, but says they won't suddenly radically replace everything. It'll happen slowly, as search became important over the past decade. "Evolution is a good thing," he says, talking about Office 2007 and how it melded old Office stuff with the UI reinvention called the Ribbon. Swisher asks Jobs to talk about what's next: "I know you're working on something and it's going to be beautiful." Jobs says the big question is how much innovation will happen on the PC, and how much on post-PC devices. "There's a real temptation" to focus on post-PC devices, because there are fewer legacy issues. It's harder to change PCs because people are comfortable with them: "They don't want a car with six wheels--they Swisher asks Bill and Steve what the biggest misunderstanding is about their relationship. "We've kept our marriage secret for over a decade now," says Jobs. Laughter. Gates looks genially speechless. "Neither of us has anything to complain about," says Gates. "...it's been fun to work together....people come and go in this industry, and it's fun when someone sticks around." Jobs gets serious: "When Bill and I first met each other and worked together...generally, we were the youngest guys in the room." Today, "I'm the oldest guy in the room most of the time." He quotes the Beatles: "You and I have memories/Longer than the road that stretches out ahead." Applause from the office. And a standing ovation, even. Audience questions: Investor Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners asks them about problems ahead that people don't see. Gates discusses education. Jobs says that Silicon Valley depends on stability, and talks about investment in alternative energy. Someone from Sony asks about whether we'll have tons of disparate focused gadgets or "grand convergence devices." Gates says the industry is good at latching onto standards when appropriate, and allowing diversity when appropriate. Jesse Kornbluth of HeadButler.com asks about legacies, complimenting Gates on his his philanthropy. Audience applause. What would he choose as his legacy? And does Jobs envy Gates because of his second act? Gates says that the most important thing he's done is the personal computer. He delayed getting married because he was obsessed with it. "That's my life's work." But he's glad he can put resources to helping the world with big problems. "I think the world is a better place because Bill realized his goal wasn't to be the richest guy in the cemetery," says Jobs. He says he grew up middle class, and Apple allowed him not to worry about money. He and Gates are two of the luckiest people around because they've gotten to spend thirty years doing what they love and work with smart people. "I don't think about legacy that much." Another question from an entrepreneur involving advice on creating value. Gates says that the excitement of the PC revolution wasn't about creating value--in 1975, when Microsoft set out to put a PC on every desk, it didn't realize that would involve being a big company. The fun and the challenge was all in figuring out how to make it happen. "It's about the people and the passion, and it's amazing that the business worked out the way it did." Jobs agrees and says that if you don't love what you're doing--or if you're just a rational person--you'll quit. "It's a lot of hard work, and it's a lot of worrying, constantly." And "you've got to be a really good talent scout...no matter how smart you are, you need a great team." Another question: Gates and Jobs approached the same opportunity very differently. What did they learn? Gates compliments Jobs on his taste for products and people. "The way he does things is just different...and it's magic." "Because Woz and I started the company based on doing the whole banana, we weren't so good at partnering with people," says Jobs. Microsoft was one of the few it worked well with. And Microsoft has always been good at partnering. It took Apple decades to figure it out. Last question: A lot of innovation in the industry is youth-oriented. Is there stuff going on in the two companies addressing aging baby boomers? Jobs says that seniors love the cameras built into Macs, and are using them for video conferencing to stay in touch with extended families. Gates says that natural-use interfaces may help--"we're warped because we grew up using the keyboard, and so it's extremely natural to us." But he showed Microsoft Surface to some execs who were blown away from it. Jobs says that personal training sessions at Apple Stores are "up to a million a year." And many of the people coming in to learn Office and videoconferencing and so forth are seniors. OK, one more question. Science fiction has long given us visions of the Matrix and the Metaverse and the Holodeck and other forms of virtual communication. Is anything that cool really on the horizon? Gates says that Jobs is going to announce a transporter soon. And then he talks about movement in space as a way of interacting with machines, and that deep investments in research on man-machine interaction will pay off. "I don't know," says Jobs. "And that's what makes it exciting to go into work every day." And so the event concludes. / 1000 max characters YouTube Guys at D: All Things Digital Hey, Give Palm's Foleo a Chance!

Skip to Main Content Google's offline web apps click into gear Published: 31 May 2007 08:26 BST Google engineers have enabled what internet surfers for years have yearned for  web applications that work offline. The search giant on Wednesday launched Google Gears, a browser plug-in that will let people run web applications when they're connected to the internet or not. The company released the source code for the Google Gears software in conjunction with , a day-long conference in 10 locations. Win a trip to San Francisco for the Intel Developer Forum in September. To enter, just start posting entries to our On the Road group blog. The goal of Google Gears is to create a single, standardised way to add offline capabilities to web applications, said Linus Upson, engineering director at Google. The initial code is aimed at JavaScript developers who write Ajax-style web applications. It runs on Internet Explorer on Windows; Firefox on Windows, Mac OS and Linux; and on the Safari Mac OS browser. Google expects to have a consumer-ready release of Google Gears, which will be under 1MB in size, "within months". It also expects to submit the code to a standards body so that it will eventually be built into all standards-compliant browsers, Upson said. "It's been a long time since the web has gained new fundamental capabilities. I think it's been about 10 years," said Upson. One of the key capabilities of Ajax development  XMLHttpRequest  came out in 1998 and took years to catch on, in part because of applications such as Google Maps. Google engineers took on the task of bringing offline access to web browsers because customers of its hosted web applications complained about not being able to work when disconnected, Upson said. "One of the reasons we're doing Gears is that developers here at Google have really pushed the envelope on what can be done in the browser so engineers are hitting barriers harder and faster," he said. The first application to have offline access through Google Gears is Google Readers, the company's RSS reader. Once people install the browser plug-in, they can read RSS content when they're offline and synchronise with the RSS feed provider when they get back online. As part of the announcement, Google said Google Gears has been endorsed by the Mozilla Foundation, makers of the open-source Firefox browser, as well as Flash developer Adobe Systems and Opera Software, which makes the Opera browser. By releasing the Google Gear code, the company hopes to get feedback from developers before releasing a consumer plug-in. The software itself has three components  a local web server which runs in the browser, the for storage, and browser extensions that allow multiple JavaScript jobs to run in parallel. With that architecture, end users will be able to run web applications even if they have flaky network connections or if the web server they are accessing is bogged down. Having a browser capable of running multiple JavaScript scripts, or threads, means that the browser is less likely to get locked up. "What we wanted to enable was to make applications that essentially run off local data even when you're connected to the network, because defining or detecting that [connection state] is very hard," said Upson. The local SQLite database, while small in size, is capable of saving gigabytes of data, although Google intends to set up Google Gears so web application providers have to ask permission from users to store data locally. Google engineers have already started work on adding full-text searching to SQLite, Upson said. Other companies have taken on the challenge of making web applications run offline before but there still lacks a generic, widely used method.

Aun 05/29/07 11:32 AM PT Toshiba has ended its monogamous relationship with Intel and will now also offer laptops with processors made by Advanced Micro Devices, the computer maker confirmed Tuesday. Toshiba will reportedly put AMD chips in about 20 percent of its notebooks, giving the chipmaker a significant shot in the arm in its rivalry with Intel. high-end, low-cost Spam Firewalls and Web Filters are trusted by over 40,000 customers worldwide  including IBM®, NASA and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security  to stop spam, spyware, viruses and other security threats. Shouldn't you? Request a free evaluation unit today. Once a feisty competitor that beat to market with processor innovations and lower costs, chipmaker (AMD) has lately slumped a bit. That could change, as Japanese electronics giant confirmed Tuesday it plans to use AMD processors in some of its laptops. The deal would pull the plug on an arrangement under which the company is buying chips exclusively from Intel. While the AMD deal is unlikely to significantly alter Intel's status as the world's dominant processor manufacturer, the pact could be a much-needed shot of adrenaline for AMD. "Any time you get an additional customer, it shines a positive light on the business," analyst Richard Shim told TechNewsWorld. Major computer makers , he noted, recently agreed to install AMD chips in some of their units. Acer also offers a line of systems without Intel inside. "AMD's mobile business has been somewhat behind in terms of market share," said Shim. "But gradually the dominoes are starting to fall ... a lot of these companies that had somewhat exclusively Intel product lines are starting to accept AMD chips now." Small Chunk, Big Pie Toshiba reportedly plans to install AMD processors in about 20 percent of the notebooks it sells in the United States and Europe. Toshiba, the world's fourth-largest computer maker, shipped 9.2 units worldwide in 2006, shim said. The company will use AMD processors in some of its mid-range notebooks, according to reports. The move may allow Toshiba to reduce by at least 10 percent the cost of components. In a 2005 lawsuit, AMD accused Intel of resorting to exclusionary business practices to monopolize the x86 processor market. The case is pending. In fact, AMD issued some subpoenas just last week. AMD's image has changed over the years, Shim said, having gone from being viewed as a lower-cost alternative to Intel to its new status as a company that can make similarly priced chips that are equal to, or better, than the market leader. "In the past they have been viewed as a value play, but more recently that position has eroded as they've been able to improve their performance and offer a more complete product," he said. Additionally, AMD has taken a grassroots approach to marketing that seems to be working. "AMD has done something different in terms of the way they go to the market," said the analyst. "In the past they used to go to the vendors and try to sell the vendors on using AMD chips. Now they go to retailers and tell them how AMD is able to help push volume through their channel. Then the retailers go to the vendors and try to get them to look into using AMD chips." While the approach "has proven to be pretty successful," Shim said, he did not know if it was a factor in Toshiba's decision. Most manufacturers feel uncomfortable having just one manufacturer for system components, including processors, he added. "So I think this is a pretty natural move for Toshiba," said Shim. "Particularly as AMD improves their mobile chip product line." Whether the deal will do much to narrow the gap between AMD and Intel is yet to be seen. "The question here is whether AMD is taking units away from Intel through the Toshiba relationship or is this kind of complementing what's already there," said Shim. "Is it additive or complementary?" Next Article in Processors: Intel Gets the Lead Out More by Fred J. Aun New White Paper: We know what you did last summer but we don't know why.

Thursday, 31st May 2007 Thu 31 May 2007 Junk e-mails set to fall after 'spammer' arrested US authorities said today computer users everywhere could notice a decrease in junk e-mail after the arrest of a man described as one of the world's most prolific spammers. Robert Soloway, 27, is accused of using networks of compromised "zombie" computers to send out millions of spam e-mails. "He's one of the top ten spammers in the world," said Tim Cranton of Microsoft's Worldwide Internet Safety Programs. "He's a huge problem for our customers. This is a very good day." A federal grand jury returned a 35-count indictment against Soloway last week, charging him with mail fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering. Soloway pleaded not guilty to all charges early today after a judge determined that - even with four bank accounts seized - he was sufficiently well off to pay for his own lawyer. Soloway had been living in a ritzy apartment and drove a Mercedes convertible, said prosecutor Kathryn Warma. Prosecutors are seeking to have him forfeit Â£386,500 they say he made from his business, Newport Internet Marketing. They say Soloway has used computers infected with malicious code to send out millions of junk e-mails since 2003.

Gears will be a new suite of applications that can be accessed offline and then synced with the Web the next time the user has Internet access. The first to be included in Gears will be Google Reader. It&#39;s a program that will automatically download "hard copies" of websites when the user is online, and make them available to view offline later. For instance, someone could download the latest news from CNN.com right before heading out on a car trip and read it on the road, without an Internet connection. This idea has been seen before, for example in certain PDA software titles, but on a very limited scope. The same technology could be put to use with Google Apps, an online office software suite where users can share documents, spreadsheets, and schedules with people across the globe. Gears would make the programs still accessible when offline, and then automatically post the updates the next time the user goes online. Gears is mainly designed as a technology that helps optimize the online experience for people who have intermittent connections, which is why Google says its strongest impact will be in places like Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Gears will also be an open source platform, allowing other developers to make use of the technology. Mozilla and Adobe are already working with Google to implement the new platform in their software products.

Jobs and Gates, together at last File photos of Bill Gates and (inset) Steve Jobs 5:06PM "You and I have memories, longer than the road that stretches out ahead." Apple CEO Steve Jobs chose that tender line from the timeless Beatles track to describe his relationship with Microsoft chairman Bill Gates when they appeared on stage together today for the first time in more than 20 years. It was just one of the countless adulations the pair poured on each other during their hotly anticipated 90-minute conversation at the D: All Things Digital conference in Carlsbad, California. Fireworks were expected, but nostalgia was the order of the day as the&#160;industry icons&#160;reflected on their joint history and pondered over the future of personal technology. To the ballroom of technology workers and the thousands of online followers who had tuned in to see Jobs and Gates go head to head, the tech titans appeared more like old mates than bitter rivals. The conversation, moderated by The Wall Street Journal 's Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, began with Swisher asking each what the other's biggest contribution to the computer industry was. "Bill built the first software company before anybody in our industry knew what software was, and that was huge," Jobs said. "Apple really pursued the dream of building products that we want to use ourselves," said Gates, adding that Jobs always seemed to figure out where the next industry movement would be. When asked what the greatest misunderstanding of their relationship was, Jobs joked: "We've kept our marriage secret for over a decade now." Gates added: "Neither of us have anything to complain about, in general. It's been fun to work together." Jobs wore his trademark black turtleneck, jeans and sneakers, while Gates was more formal, wearing a button down shirt, dress pants and shoes. It could have almost been a scene from one of Apple's "I'm a Mac, and i'm a PC" ads, minus the anti-PC sledging. "The art of those commercials isn't to be mean, it's for those guys to like each other," Jobs said when Swisher quizzed him on the ads. "PC guy is great, he's got a big heart." The mutual adulation and banter was interspersed with reflections on the early days of the personal computing industry, when Microsoft and Apple worked far more closely together. "Let me tell the story!" Jobs jokingly quipped when Gates began recounting how the Apple II computer, first introduced in the '70s, used Microsoft software. Both Jobs and Gates agreed that computers - Macs and PCs - were not losing relevance in a world where applications were increasingly being accessed through the web browser. "The PC has been very resilient - its death has been predicted many times," Jobs said, after noting that desktop applications were far more powerful than web applications. The last time the pair made a joint public appearance was in 1997 at the Macworld convention in Boston - Gates was beamed in by teleconference, and he and Jobs announced that Microsoft had invested $US150 million in Apple. But no announcements came out of this joint appearance, with both sides getting those formalities out of the way earlier in the day. Apple announced its Apple TV device would begin playing YouTube videos, while Microsoft showed off its latest innovation - a coffee-table shaped computer that responds to touch and to special barcodes attached to everyday objects.

Antarctica lost much more ice to the sea than it gained from snowfall according to a NASA survey done between 1992 and 2002. It also had a corresponding rise in sea level. The survey documented for the first time extensive thinning of the West Antarctic ice shelves. (Credit: NASA/SVS) From a combination of climate models, satellite data, and paleoclimate records the scientists conclude that the West Antarctic ice sheet, Arctic ice cover, and regions providing fresh water sources and species habitat are under threat from continued global warming. The research appears in the current issue of Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. Tipping points can occur during climate change when the climate reaches a state such that strong amplifying feedbacks are activated by only moderate additional warming. This study finds that global warming of 0.6&ordm;C in the past 30 years has been driven mainly by increasing greenhouse gases, and only moderate additional climate forcing is likely to set in motion disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet and Arctic sea ice. Amplifying feedbacks include increased absorption of sunlight as melting exposes darker surfaces and speedup of iceberg discharge as the warming ocean melts ice shelves that otherwise inhibit ice flow. The researchers used data on earlier warm periods in Earth&rsquo;s history to estimate climate impacts as a function of global temperature, climate models to simulate global warming, and satellite data to verify ongoing changes. Lead author James Hansen, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, New York, concludes: &ldquo;If global emissions of carbon dioxide continue to rise at the rate of the past decade, this research shows that there will be disastrous effects, including increasingly rapid sea level rise, increased frequency of droughts and floods, and increased stress on wildlife and plants due to rapidly shifting climate zones.&rdquo; The researchers also investigate what would be needed to avert large climate change, thus helping define practical implications of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That treaty, signed in 1992 by the United States and almost all nations of the world, has the goal to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gases &ldquo;at a level that prevents dangerous human-made interference with the climate system.&rdquo; Based on climate model studies and the history of the Earth the authors conclude that additional global warming of about 1&ordm;C (1.8&ordm;F) or more, above global temperature in 2000, is likely to be dangerous. In turn, the temperature limit has implications for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO ), which has already increased from the pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million (ppm) to 383 ppm today and is rising by about 2 ppm per year. According to study co-author Makiko Sato of Columbia&rsquo;s Earth Institute, &ldquo;the temperature limit implies that CO exceeding 450 ppm is almost surely dangerous, and the ceiling may be even lower.&rdquo; The study also shows that the reduction of non-carbon dioxide forcings such as methane and black soot can offset some CO increase, but only to a limited extent. Hansen notes that &ldquo;we probably need a full court press on both CO emission rates and non-CO forcings, to avoid tipping points and save Arctic sea ice and the West Antarctic ice sheet.&rdquo; A computer model developed by the Goddard Institute was used to simulate climate from 1880 through today. The model included a more comprehensive set of natural and human-made climate forcings than previous studies, including changes in solar radiation, volcanic particles, human-made greenhouse gases, fine particles such as soot, the effect of the particles on clouds and land use. Extensive evaluation of the model&rsquo;s ability to simulate climate change is contained in a companion paper to be published in Climate Dynamics. The authors use the model for climate simulations of the 21st century using both &lsquo;business-as-usual&rsquo; growth of greenhouse gas emissions and an &lsquo;alternative scenario&rsquo; in which emissions decrease slowly in the next few decades and then rapidly to achieve stabilization of atmospheric CO amount by the end of the century. Climate changes are so large with &lsquo;business-as-usual&rsquo;, with additional global warming of 2-3&ordm;C (3.6-5.4&ordm;F) that Hansen concludes &ldquo;&lsquo;business-as-usual&rsquo; would be a guarantee of global and regional disasters.&rdquo; However, the study finds much less severe climate change &ndash; one-quarter to one-third that of the "business-as-usual" scenario &ndash; when greenhouse gas emissions follow the alternative scenario. &ldquo;Climate effects may still be substantial in the 'alternative scenario&rsquo;, but there is a better chance to adapt to the changes and find other ways to further reduce the climate change,&rdquo; said Sato. While the researchers say it is still possible to achieve the &ldquo;alternative scenario,&rdquo; they note that significant actions will be required to do so. Emissions must begin to slow soon. &ldquo;With another decade of &lsquo;business-as-usual&rsquo; it becomes impractical to achieve the &lsquo;alternative scenario&rsquo; because of the energy infrastructure that would be in place&rdquo; says Hansen.

Microsoft Unveils 'Surface' Computing -->) chairman and soon-to-retire chief visionary Bill Gates has been touting alternative forms of computer-human interaction for years, such as tablet computing and voice recognition. On Wednesday, the company said it will deliver on that promise by the end of the year with a device that presents information using an intuitive touch-screen interface based on a display embedded in a table top. The announcement, made by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, came at The Wall Street Journal 's "D: All Things Digital" conference being held this week in Carlsbad, Calif. Dubbed Microsoft Surface, the computer and its interface is the result of six years of collaboration between the company's hardware and Microsoft Research (MSR) divisions. But far from being a research project never meant to see the light of day, the company announced four launch customers for the product. That doesn't mean you can look for them at your neighborhood computer store any time soon. Right now, at least, the devices are too expensive for the average household. While Microsoft would not reveal the actual cost to customers, they will likely range from about $5,000 to $10,000 each, a Microsoft spokesperson told Instead, Microsoft intends to sell the first versions to commercial enterprises. Indeed, Microsoft executives see markets for Surface in hundreds of thousands of restaurants, hotels and retail locations. Ballmer announced that Surface's launch customers are Harrah's Entertainment, which is looking to initially install them as virtual concierge kiosks in its seven Las Vegas casinos. Similarly, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide will launch Surface at Sheraton hotels and resorts in its lobbies, including the ability to browse for music and download books with the use of a credit card. International Game Technology will create gaming devices and systems via a development and distribution agreement with Microsoft &#150; video poker on steroids anyone? Finally, T-Mobile USA, owned by Deutsche Telekom AG, announced it is looking to use Surface devices as in-store kiosks where customers could compare phones and wireless plans simply by placing them side-by-side on the table top. "Surface is one example of how we're turning our stores into a playground where customers can comfortably explore exciting new products in their own personal way," Bonita Inza, vice president of retail at T-Mobile USA, said in a Microsoft statement. No Mouse, No Keyboard First begun as a joint project between MSR researchers and Microsoft's hardware group in 2001, it has evolved into a commercial product that some analysts say is viable &#150; even innovative. Surface features a 30-inch diagonal square display built into a table configuration. It consists of a computer running a customized version of Windows Vista, a rear projection screen and five cameras that look through the screen to recognize and read items placed on the surface, as well as to track hand gestures and touch. It has wired 10/100Mbit Ethernet and wireless 802.11 b/g and Bluetooth 2.0 support built in. It supports multiple touch points &#150; Microsoft says "dozens and dozens" -- as well as multiple users simultaneously, so more than one person could be using it at once, or one person could be doing multiple tasks. The term "surface" describes how it's used. There is no keyboard or mouse. All interactions with the computer are done via touching the surface of the computer's screen with hands or brushes, or via wireless interaction with devices such as smartphones, digital cameras or Microsoft's Zune music player. Because of the cameras, the device can also recognize physical objects; for instance credit cards or hotel "loyalty" cards. This ability to actually deal with physical objects is one of Surface's unique capabilities. The idea, said Microsoft, is to bridge the physical and virtual worlds. "It's very intuitive to use &#91;and&#93; it's not like anything else out there," Matt Rosoff, analyst for consumer strategy and corporate affairs at industry newsletter Directions on Microsoft, told . "It's a new category &#91;and&#93; I think it's very innovative." Want to move digital pictures around on the tabletop? Use your finger to push them around so you can see them better. Need to resize a favorite shot? Grab two opposite corners with your fingers and drag them apart to enlarge it. For instance, a user could set a digital camera down on the tabletop and wirelessly transfer pictures into folders on Surface's hard drive. Or setting a music player down would let a user drag songs from his or her home music collection directly into the player, or between two players, using a finger &#150; or transfer mapping information for the location of a restaurant where you just made reservations through a Surface tabletop over to a smartphone just before you walk out the door. Plan a day out. And whereas Microsoft usually doesn't build hardware to sell &#150; like tablet PCs or mobile phones &#150; this time the company smells money. "We see this as a multi billion dollar category, and we envision a time when surface computing technologies will be pervasive, from tabletops and counters to the hallway mirror," Microsoft CEO Ballmer said in a statement. When will all this transpire? Surface will begin surfacing at its four partners&#146; locations by the end of the year, Microsoft says. Microsoft executives also see broader applications for surface computing, including in schools, businesses and homes and in several form factors, such as built into refrigerators, walls, or counter tops. And make no mistake, Microsoft intends to sell a lot of Surface devices into consumer householders a few years down the line &#150; hopefully, in three to five years, the spokesperson said. "It's what Windows Media Center &#91;Edition&#93; probably should have been," Rob Enderle, principal analyst at research firm Enderle Group told . "Even though it's not initially slated for your living room, it would fit well there once the price comes down." Gates and Apple ( -->) CEO Steve Jobs were scheduled to share the stage Wednesday evening for an "unrehearsed, unscripted, onstage conversation" with writers Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, according to the event's producers. to your browser search box

YouTube goes AppleTube as Apple TV gets upgrade Has Jobs backed the wrong horse with Apple TV's YouTube access? More iPhone clues and rumours YouTube on your Apple TV Shes no Bruce Springsteen, just a new low-fat milk producing Bossey called Marge As previously announced, iTunes Plus songs cost $US1.29. We now know that&#39;s $A2.19. Previously purchased songs can be upgraded for $US0.30 or $A0.50, and there&#39;s a &#39;one click&#39; option to upgrade all EMI content in an iTunes library at once at $US0.30/$A0.50 per song or $US3.00/$A5.10 for most albums. (The reason for the extra $A0.10 is anyone&#39;s guess.) "Our customers are very excited about the freedom and amazing sound quality of iTunes Plus," said Steve Jobs, Apple&#39;s CEO. "We expect more than half of the songs on iTunes will be offered in iTunes Plus versions by the end of this year." "This is a tremendous milestone for digital music," said Eric Nicoli, CEO of EMI Group. "Consumers are going to love listening to higher quality iTunes Plus tracks from their favorite EMI artists with no usage restrictions." iTunes 7.2 is required to preview or purchase iTunes Plus tracks. The lists of top songs on iTunes Plus show that people are mainly buying old favourites in the new format. Walking On Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves), Bette Davis Eyes (Kim Carnes), Have I Told You Lately? (Van Morrison), The House of the Rising Sun (The Animals), I Am Woman (Helen Reddy), A Good Heart (Feargal Sharkey) and Cars (Gary Numan) are just a few of the golden oldies being bought by Australians. US buyers are picking up some tracks from those eras, including Start Me Up (The Rolling Stones), Do You Really Want To Hurt Me (Boy George and Culture Club) and I Get Around (The Beach Boys), but they&#39;re also going back a generation and picking up Ain&#39;t That A Kick In The Head and Volare (Dean Martin); Fever (Peggy Lee); Unforgettable (Nat "King" Cole) and Come Fly With Me, I&#39;ve Got The World On A String and Witchcraft (Frank Sinatra). A variety of third-party add-ons for iTunes (the Mac OS X version at least) allow users to easily transfer tracks to Bluetooth devices such as mobile phones and via USB to any gadget that presents as a storage device (phones and most MP3 players). While we haven&#39;t seen any that provide full iPod-style synchronisation, we expect these little pieces of software to gain fresh popularity now the iTunes Store is selling DRM-free tracks that will play on any device that can handle AAC files.

Microsoft&rsquo;s claims that it will ask distributors and users to pay royalties for up to 235 of its patents included in open-source software, including Linux, is clearly an attempt to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt and make people hesitant to use open source as an alternative to commercial products, intellectual-property (IP) attorneys said. But the claims also raise questions about the business strategy behind Microsoft&rsquo;s aggressive moves to seek licensing money from patents amid rumbles that customers have been slow to adopt Windows Vista and Office 2007, while new products such as the Xbox 360 remain unprofitable. The matter came to light on May 14 with the publication of a Fortune article that included Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer saying, &ldquo;We live in a world where we honor, and support the honoring of, intellectual property,&rdquo; adding that users of free and open-source software have to &ldquo;play by the same rules as the rest of the business. What&rsquo;s fair is fair.&rdquo; The article included comments from additional Microsoft executives detailing plans to seek the infringement claims, and just as it was posted online, Microsoft sent e-mail to other journalists about the issue. There may be a link between the timing of Microsoft&rsquo;s claims against open source and the release of its Windows Vista product, said Stuart Meyer, partner at Fenwick & West in Rather than add features to that would make business users want to adopt it, the OS&rsquo; distinguishing characteristic is the addition of an engine that will shut down user access to if they are using a counterfeit or pirated version of the software, he said. &ldquo;Why do people want to want to switch to an OS that just includes new hurdles that have to be cleared?&rdquo; Microsoft may have decided that enforcing its IP through litigation is more important than offering innovative software that can compete on its own merits, a strategy that may leave many users unimpressed, Meyer suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just friction that doesn&rsquo;t advance the ball,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough for people to get behind this even if it&rsquo;s part of our constitution [to prevent patent infringement].&rdquo; Microsoft&rsquo;s unwillingness to specifically identify which patents are being violated also shows it is less than serious about initiating litigation, which may suggest the company knows it will be a tough battle to fight, Meyer said. &ldquo;If Microsoft wanted a lawsuit, they would have brought the lawsuit first.&rdquo; The only way to force Microsoft legally to show which patents are being infringed is for a Linux distribution company such as Red Hat or other open-source vendors who think they may be violating patents to bring a summary judgment in court against the company. This would require that Microsoft sue them if they want to collect royalties, he said. Mark Wine, an IP lawyer and partner at McDermott Will & Emery in , agreed that Microsoft is hoping companies will pay without a fight rather than engage them in a legal battle. He also said Microsoft may be trying to drive open-source software users to migrate to its products. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s as much a marketing move as anything else,&rdquo; Wine said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re really serious, you tell [open-source users] which patents, or you sue them.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no love lost between Microsoft and the open-source industry, and it&rsquo;s been clear for years the software giant sees open source as a threat. Before Linux became the widely used OS for commodity servers from Hewlett-Packard and Dell, the Windows Server was the top choice for low-end servers. Microsoft has also seen open-source products threatening to commoditize key areas of its business, including worker productivity software, CRM (customer relationship management) software and developer tools. Many also argue that Microsoft is at a turning point as it tries to build a successful business around online services and advertising after it waited too long to adopt the new business model that rocketed Google to its current success. While Microsoft launched products such as the Xbox 360 game console and Zune digital media player in an area it said will be key going forward&mdash;entertainment and devices&mdash;neither device has proved successful. The former product, while popular, has so far made no money for the company, and the latter is flailing against its exceedingly popular and incumbent competitor, Apple&rsquo;s iPod. It remains to be seen whether Microsoft will be able to collect on its claims or if the open-source community will use them to strive for patent reform, currently a popular issue before the US Congress. However, the claims certainly will raise important issues around how patent-infringement cases will be litigated in the future, said Paul Lesko, head of the IP litigation group at SimmonsCooper LLC in &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s going to be a skirmish in the future, they helped draw the lines,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It applies pressure [to open-source companies]...to find out how many of those patents are worth the paper they are printed on.&rdquo; Linux evangelist Eric Raymond seems to think the patents at issue fall under the latter category. &ldquo;It is nearly as certain that those patents are all junk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If Microsoft had sound and critically relevant patents to assert, they wouldn&rsquo;t need to screw around with vague threats. They&rsquo;d simply publish the patent numbers and it would be game over for Linux.&rdquo; Horacio Gutierrez, Microsoft vice president of intellectual property and licensing, said that while Microsoft won&rsquo;t discuss specific patents publicly, it has discussed them in private with companies such as Novell that struck deals with the company to exchange patent royalties for indemnification against litigation. Microsoft&rsquo;s recent claims are an attempt to avoid going to court, Gutierrez said. &ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve done is we&rsquo;ve come up first with a licensing mechanism that is a reasonable [way] for companies in the business of distributing open-source software to reach an understanding [with us].&rdquo; However, he also acknowledged that Microsoft&rsquo;s decision to seek royalties for patents is a business one. &ldquo;Microsoft invests over 6 billion in research and development a year, and that&rsquo;s an investment that results in innovation. Our shareholders have a right to expect that we are going to protect that innovation.&rdquo; Grant Gross in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.

A critical look at tech and business issues. Gates and Jobs make nice Seattle Times senior technology reporter Apple's Steve Jobs, left, and Microsoft's Bill Gates sit down for a chat Wednesday at the D: All Things Digital conference in Carlsbad, Calif. Building "business muscle" gives Microsoft new shape CARLSBAD, Calif. -- The audience was expecting daggers, but it got roses instead when Bill Gates and Steve Jobs had a rare public conversation Wednesday night at The Wall Street Journal's D: All Things Digital conference. The line of the night came from Jobs, who closed the conversation by noting that he thinks of most things in life as either a Bob Dylan song or Beatles song, then quoted a Beatles lyric from "Two of Us." " 'You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead.' That's clearly true here," he said. It may sound saccharine, but the uplifting, conciliatory message had a cathartic effect on an audience full of high-powered executives and investors in cutthroat industries going through dramatic changes. Expectations were high before the appearance, with billionaires and their minions from the tech and media industries lined up at the door for the best seats in what promised to be an epic showdown. The rivalry between Microsoft and Apple has intensified over the last year as Apple has continued its renaissance, growing its computer business faster than the Windows PC market, while needling its Redmond rival with a series of mocking, sarcastic advertisements. Microsoft, meanwhile, is going after Apple's cash cow with a line of iPod competitors and steadily expanding its presence in home entertainment markets that Apple covets. But away from the office, the two godfathers of the personal-computer industry turned out to be more friends than enemies. The men sounded a lot alike, agreed on most topics and ended up giving each other warm praise that practically brought them and the audience to tears. Much of their 90-minute chat, moderated by Journal columnists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, was spent reminiscing about working together in the early days of the Macintosh and their enthusiasm for the current flood of innovation in the tech industry. They also offered somewhat different visions for the future of computers when asked where things will head in the next five years. Gates said people will have multiple computers of different sizes, including a small pocket-size device, a workstation at home and at the office, and a large screen for entertainment with computing power and an Internet connection. Jobs said he's expecting radical advances to come in what he called "post-PC" devices, an area where Apple has been focused on developing the soon-to-be-introduced iPhone as a combination phone, music player and Internet device. Both were enthusiastic about how their latest work has been unexpectedly embraced by older generations. Gates said he was surprised by the way chief executives who grew up before keyboards became such a big part of life took to the hand-controlled tabletop computer that Microsoft unveiled this week. Jobs said older customers are especially big users of Macs' videoconferencing capabilities and of Apple stores' training sessions. Jobs also noted that both Apple and Microsoft consider themselves to be software companies, noting that the iPod "is really just the software -- it's in a beautiful box, but it's software." "There aren't very many software companies left, and Microsoft is a software company," he said, when asked how much he watches his competitor. "We look at what they do. We think some of it's really great. Some of it's competitive, some of it's not." One person in the audience praised Gates' philanthropy, drawing huge applause, then asked how both feel about their legacies. Both said they're happy to have contributed so much to the rise of personal computing. "The most important work I got a chance to be involved with, no matter what I do, is the personal computer," Gates said, explaining that that's been his obsession and life's work. "It's lucky for me some of the skills and resources that I was able to develop through those experiences can be applied to the benefit of the people who haven't had technology, including medicine, working for them. So it's an incredible blessing to have two things like that," he said. "But if you look inside my brain, it's filled with software ... that's not going to change." Asked if he envied "Bill's second act," Jobs said, "The world's a better place because Bill realized his goal wasn't to be the richest guy in a cemetery. He's doing a lot of good with the money he's made. "I sort of look at us as two of the luckiest guys on the planet," Jobs said. "We found what we love to do, and we were at the right place at the right time." Toward the end, Swisher asked what sort of misunderstandings people have about their relationship. "We've kept our marriage secret for over a decade," Jobs, 52, quipped. The 51-year-old Gates paused for a long time, then said, "I don't think either of us have anything to complain about." He talked about how much fun it was to work on the Mac and how much he appreciates having another old-timer around to swap stories with. "It's been fun to work together," he said. "I actually miss some of the people who aren't around anymore. People come and go in this industry; it's nice when people stick around and they have some context about what works and what doesn't work." The mutual admiration continued. Asked which qualities they envied in each other, each offered interesting perspectives "I'd give a lot to have Steve's taste," Gates said, then tried to calm the laughter, saying it's "not a joke at all." He talked about how in the past they sat in Mac product-review sessions. "I'd view it as an engineering question," he said. "I'd see Steve make the decision based on a sense of people and product that is hard for me to explain. The way he does things is just different. It's magic. In that case, wow." Jobs said Apple wasn't as good at partnering with people as Microsoft, perhaps because of its legacy as a company that built entire systems itself. "Bill and Microsoft were very good at it," he said. "I think if Apple could have had a little more of that in its DNA, it would have served it extremely well," Jobs said, adding that the company "didn't learn that for decades."

Russian cosmonauts walking in space Floating in space... Cosmonaut Oleg Kotov, left, and Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin, right, are seen during a scheduled six-hour space walk to install Service Module Debris Protection panels on Zvezda and reroute a Global Positioning System antenna cable. 8:06AM Two Russian cosmonauts began a spacewalk outside the international space station on Wednesday to install panels designed to shield it from dangerous space debris. The walk by commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov was scheduled to last six hours. The station's third occupant, US astronaut Sunita Williams, remained inside. "OK!" Yurchikhin said as he opened the hatch. Space debris includes discarded rocket parts, planetary dust and rocks. Scientists consider it the greatest threat to the space station orbiting about 354km above Earth. Engineers on the ground are able to monitor by radar the largest pieces of space debris - objects larger than a softball - and adjust the station's position accordingly, so the shielding will protect against smaller objects. "The consequence of small particles is not so great," said Kirk Shireman, NASA's deputy program manager for the space station. "Then there are the mid-range particles. Those are the ones we worry about." The spacewalk started about 45 minutes late, but a bright moon allowed the cosmonauts to catch up by working through what normally would have been darkness after orbital sunsets. The space station circles the Earth every 90 minutes. The 17 protective panels each are about 0.6m by 0.9m and weigh about 20kg. The cosmonauts also planned to fix a navigation antenna that will be used later in the year for the first flight of a new European cargo vehicle, and they intended to deposit canisters containing biological experiments outside the station. Yurchikhin and Kotov will perform another spacewalk next Wednesday with similar tasks. send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today Russian cosmonauts walking in space Floating in space...

But itâs truly revolutionary. Itâs going to change the way people work with their computers.â Wow. Already, the hype needle was in the red zone. What was it, a ten-button mouse? Nope. What it was, as the world found out yesterday, was a new touch-screen computer. The 30-inch screen sits 21 inches off the ground, as though it is the top of a fancy coffee table. You manipulate objects on the screen with your fingers. Drag virtual photos to sort them, flick an on-screen globe to spin it and so on. This new âsurface computer,â as Microsoft calls it, has a multi-touch screen. You can use two fingers or even more &#8212; for example, you can drag two corners of a photograph outward to zoom in on it. Hereâs an article in yesterdayâs Times about it If this is all sounding creepily familiar, it is probably because so far, all of this is exactly what NYU researcher Jeff Han has been demonstrating for a year and a half now. Iâve written about it several times on my This multi-touch screen is also a key feature of Appleâs iPhone. You can do the same two-finger stretching business on its all-glass screen to zoom in on a picture or a Web page. Microsoftâs press materials and Web site coyly ignore the existence of these earlier pioneers; when pressed, it insists that its surface computer was developed well before Jeff Han *or* Apple came along. Microsoft says that 120 people have been secretly working on its version, tucked away in an off-campus building, for five years. The Microsoft surface computer makes an absolutely spectacular demo movie. Hereâs a good one put together by Microsoftâs version of the multi-touch computer adds one very cool, though impractical, twist: interaction with other electronics. For example, in Microsoftâs demonstration, you can take some pictures. When you set the camera down on the table top, the fresh photos come pouring out of it into a virtual puddle on the screen &#8212; a slick, visual way to indicate that youâve just downloaded them. Next, you can set a cellphone down on the table &#8212; and copy photos into it just by dragging them into the cellphoneâs zone. Then you can buy songs from a virtual music store and drag them directly into a Zune music player that youâve placed on the glass. How cool is all of this? Very. Unfortunately, at this point, itâs the Microsoft version of a concept car; you can ogle it, but you canât have it. These stunts require concept cameras, concept cellphones and concept music players that have been rigged to interact with the surface computer. Behind the scenes, the surface computer is a pretty elaborate setup. Under the hood is Windows Vista, although you don&#8217;t see any trace of it. A projector sits underneath the tabletop, projecting images onto it. Five video cameras observe your hand movements and relay information to the computer. You won&#8217;t see surface computers for sale at Wal-Mart any time soon. This fall, Microsoft will begin by installing these machines in 1,200 T-mobile cellphone stores; Starwood Hotels; Harrah&#8217;s casino; and IGT video-game stores. For the moment, in other words, Microsoft is selling surface computers only to other companies (for $5,000 to $10,000 per unit, depending on the size of the order). Even without the involvement of other gadgets, though, Microsoft offers some tasty demo modules to show the possibilities. . You pull up on-screen, virtual menus on all four edges of the table at once &#8212; because four of you are eating out together &#8212; and order your meal by tapping what you want. While you wait for the food, you can each play your own video game, or open up four different Web browsers. And then, after dinner, you can call up your bill, split it four ways, and pay, all electronically. . You walk into a hotel. You see a virtual model of, say, New York City; look up a restaurant; see what it looks like; and drag the restaurantâs address and phone number into your phone, where it shows up as a text message. . Finger-painting for the new millennium. Thatâs gotta be worth $10,000 right there. . In this game demo, clear glass tiles (real ones) are placed onto a video thatâs playing on the surface. Now you can scatter and scramble them on the glass, even turning them upside-down; the challenge is to reassemble the video by moving and flipping the tiles, as though itâs a new-age jigsaw puzzle. . In this phone-store demonstration, you can take a phone model off the shelf &#8212; or several &#8212; and put them onto the tabletop to get the details, like features, calling plans, and so on. You can build a side-by-side comparison, sample some ringtones, or assign a ringtone to someone in your contacts list just by sliding it onto the appropriate name. (Again, this demo doesnât work with any current phones.) Thereâs a lot of imagination going on here, for sure, but even more hype. Iâm especially discouraged by the Web headlines that breathlessly gush about a revolution in computing &#8212; including, alas, Popular Mechanics.com. âForget the keyboard and mouse,â says the headline. âThe next generation of computer interfaces will be hands-on.â Letâs make one thing clear: multi-touch computing does not mean the end of the keyboard and mouse. As the new world of multi-touch-screen computing dawns, youâll see a lot of demos involving photo stretching and Web surfing demos. But you will *never* see word processors, e-mail programs, spreadsheets, databases or accounting programs. Thatâs because touch-screen computers are terrible for these mainstream computing tasks. Typing of any kind, in fact, is a nightmare when you canât feel the keys. Itâs inaccurate, slow and unsatisfying. Microsoft says that it has big plans for its surface-computing initiative: more sizes and shapes are on the way, and someday, lower prices and maybe home editions. And thatâs awesome. Itâs about time we, the people, get real-world access to the kinds of juicy demos we see in But if this is truly the future of computing, Microsoft will first have to overcome the mother of all chicken-and-egg conundrums. Surface computers wonât go mainstream until we all have phones, cameras and music players that work with them &#8212; and nobody will manufacture those gadgets until thereâs a critical mass of surface computers. In the meantime, a word of advice: donât throw away your keyboard. 3 comments so far... Is typing with a virtual keyboard really as horrible as you make it sound? I don&#8217;t recall you bashing it so much when you reviewed the iPhone. During his interview with Walt Mossberg yesterday at the D, Steve Jobs said that their virtual keyboard took some getting used to, but that after about one week of use and learning to trust it, it is much better and more efficient. Having used the phone yourself, can you substantiate this claim? See you at the iPhone launch next month (i wish) â Posted by Jordan D Forget Surface computers &#8212; how about phones, cameras and music players which work wirelessly with my desktop. And while it may look cool, the last thing I want is the pictures from my vacation in a random puddle someplace (be it a table-top, desktop or floor). This all is demo-ware at its finest. â Posted by Mike Wyman #1 wrote: &#8220;Is typing with a virtual keyboard really as horrible as you make it sound?

Washington State Office of the Attorney General has dubbed the Seattle Spammer was given an August 6 trial, during which he is set to face 35 charges related to suspected fraudulent Internet activities. Soloway, owner of Newport Internet Marketing, was indicted by a federal grand jury on May 23 in a U.S. District Court in Seattle on 10 counts of mail fraud, 5 counts of wire fraud, 2 counts of e-mail fraud, 5 counts of aggravated identity theft and 13 counts of money laundering. Soloway pleaded not guilty to all charges on Wednesday at his arraignment, according to court documents. The indictment is a culmination of an investigation collaboratively conducted by the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation unit, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property units of the Department of Justice, according to the U.S. Attorney's office. "Spam is a scourge of the Internet, and Robert Soloway is one of its most prolific practitioners. Our investigators dubbed him the Spam King because he is responsible for millions of spam e-mails," Jeffrey Sullivan, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington, said in a statement. Soloway is being accused of operating false Web sites and more than 50 domains, through which he posed as an advertiser offering legitimate "broadcast e-mail services" with "permission-based opt-in e-mail addresses." He allegedly deceived legitimate businesses into buying marketing software and services that turned out to be spam tools. Businesses that complained were met with intimidation and threats, according to the allegations against Soloway. The alleged spammer is also accused of creating more than 2,000 proxy computers, or botnets--computers hijacked by hackers to send spam--and of using stolen e-mail and domain names that led to others' ISP addresses being blocked and those victims accused of being originating spammers. The trial is set to go before Judge Marsha Pechman, with a detention hearing prior to that on June 4 before Judge James Donohue. Until then, Soloway is scheduled to remain in custody. Soloway, whose assets have been forfeited by the U.S. government, was also appointed a public defender Wednesday. While Soloway is being charged for alleged actions between November 2003 and May 2007, he incorporated Newport Internet Marketing, or NIM, in 1998 in California. Soloway moved his organization to Oregon in 2000 and then again to Seattle in 2003, where he has been living ever since.

Google Inc. said on Tuesday it was introducing street-level map views of various U.S. cities, giving Web users a panoramic, 360-degree images as well as the overhead views Google Maps has offered. REUTERS/Steve Marcus SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google Inc. said on Tuesday it was introducing street-level map views of various U.S. cities, giving Web users a panoramic, 360-degree images as well as the overhead views Google Maps has offered. With the new "Street View" feature in Google Maps, street level imagery is available for maps of the San Francisco area, New York, Las Vegas, Denver and Miami, and will soon expand to other metropolitan regions, Google said in a statement. Users looking at Google Maps through a Web browser can navigate around a city, "virtually" walking the streets, checking out restaurants and landmarks and even zoom in on bus stops or street signs to make travel plans. ADVERTISEMENT (article continues below) Google is playing catch-up with street-level viewing features, following in the footsteps of A9.com's BlockView mapping feature introduced in early 2005 and showing street-level views in roughly two dozen major U.S. cities. A9.com, a unit of Amazon.com Inc. , discontinued the feature in September 2006. A9 Chief Executive Udi Manber subsequently joined Google as vice president of engineering. has offered what it calls a "birds-eye" view on parts of its MSN Virtual Earth three-dimensional mapping service for several big U.S. cites since late in 2005. Google also announced plans for "Mapplets," a tool for independent software developers to build mini-applications that be displayed within Google Maps. Mapplets can display a variety of information, from housing listings to crime data as well as ways to measure distances between different points on the map. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo Inc. and MapQuest, a unit of Time Warner Inc.'s AOL online business, all continue to compete aggressively to create new online mapping features, said analyst Greg Sterling of Sterling Market Intelligence. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of Web sites now rely on one of the major online map providers to create hybrid mapping applications, popularly known as "mashups," he estimated. Google made the announcements at the Where 2.0 conference taking place in San Jose this week. More details can be found at http://maps.google.com/preview.

Apple is also offering an enhanced version of the video player, offering four times more storage capacity, enough it says for up to 200 hours of standard definition video. Thousands of the most current and popular YouTube videos will be available on Apple TV from mid-June, with YouTube adding thousands more each week until the full YouTube catalogue is available in the autumn. Significantly, it seems that this will involve converting the originally uploaded clips to H.264 format, an industry standard video compression scheme supported by Apple through QuickTime. It is not clear whether the H.264 clips will also be available on the web, which would enable them to be viewed on other devices that may not support the Flash video format. Users will be able to navigate through YouTube&#8217;s video browsing categories or search for specific videos. YouTube members can also log-in to their YouTube accounts on Apple TV to view and save their favourite videos. The deal with YouTube, now owned by Google, goes some way to addressing the lack of material available on Apple TV, although it is relatively easy to transfer even high-definition video to the box. YouTube clips shown on a television screen are currently relatively low in quality and no match for even standard definition video, but resolution is in the eye of the beholder. Clips shown at a recent conference on a large presentation screen were surprisingly watchable. &#8220;This is the first time users can easily browse, find and watch YouTube videos right from their living room couch, and it&#8217;s really, really fun,&#8221; said Steve Jobs, the chief executive of Apple. &#8220;YouTube is a worldwide sensation, and Apple TV is bringing it directly from the Internet onto the widescreen TV in your living room.&#8221; The YouTube feature for Apple TV will be available as a free software update in mid-June. Apple has also launched iTunes Plus audio tracks without digital rights management. The DRM-free music tracks are encoded at 256kbps. Selected titles from the EMI catalogue are currently available for $1.29 per track. Steve Jobs said he expected that more than half the five million or so songs on iTunes will be available in the format by the end of the year. The Apple TV with a larger 160GB hard drive will be available on order at a cost an additional $100 at $399. The larger drive addresses one of the other main criticisms of the Apple TV when it launched, providing a more reasonable amount of storage, particularly for high-definition video. Expect to see high-definition video material available through iTunes and other services in due course, and perhaps YouTube clips on the forthcoming Apple iPhone. Consider the possibility of services like Joost being added to Apple TV in the future. It confirms our view at informitv that the Apple TV has the potential to become the equivalent of the iPod for the television. The iPod took some time to reach its established status and there will doubtless be further iterations of the Apple TV proposition.

Interestingly Soloway of Washington, is the founder of the so-called &#8220;Strategic Partnership Against Microsoft Illegal Spam&#8221;, or SPAMIS, but is himself said to be one of the Internet&#8217;s biggest spammers through his company, Newport Internet Marketing.

He revealed this in a recent interview with Next-Gen.biz. However he did note that Halo 3 shouldn&#8217;t essentially be visually compared to other titles and other development studios, since they claim that their fiercest competitors are themselves. And this statement surely sprouts out after the launch of the Halo 3 multiplayer beta, after which a significant portion of the testers started having second thoughts whether Bungie will be able to bring the series into the next generation, especially when compared to games such as Gears of War. &#8220;We think that the final aesthetic look of our game will be judged at launch in September and in part based on the more intense single player spaces,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said. &#8220;We&#8217;re also Read the rest of this story >> NARUTO: Path of the Ninja RPG for Nintendo DS announced by TOMY and D3Publisher of America TOMY Corporation and D3Publisher of America have announced the Naruto: Path of the Ninja (working title) exclusive game for the Nintendo DS game system.

Marois May 30 (Bloomberg) -- Two humpback whales may have found their way back into the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay after wandering off their migration path for more than two weeks. The mother and calf, dubbed Delta and Dawn, were last seen 8:30 p.m. yesterday within 5 miles (8.3 kilometers) of the Golden Gate Bridge. They may have slipped under the bridge overnight and into open sea, said Bernadette Fees, a deputy director with the California Department of Fish and Game. ``It is reasonable they&#39;ve made their way out,&#39;&#39; Fees said this evening. The duo, which wandered off course en route to Alaska, attracted crowds to the banks of the Sacramento River as they meandered upstream starting about May 13. After resisting efforts to drive them back south toward the ocean, the whales thrilled rescuers yesterday by crossing back into San Pablo Bay, just north of San Francisco Bay. ``We all cheered like, `Yay!&#39;&#39;&#39; Jim Oswald, a spokesman for the Marine Mammal Center, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ``It&#39;s been really exhilarating.&#39;&#39; Today probably marked the end of a weeks-long detour during which the whales traveled as far as 70 miles (112 kilometers) off course. By May 20, they had reached a dead end at the Port of Sacramento, northeast of San Francisco. They turned downriver, then spent more than a week stalled in fresh water. Their unwillingness to head back to the Pacific frustrated rescuers, who tried to drive the whales homeward. Scientists fired on the whales with water cannons, played sound recordings of an Orca feeding on a whale and even car- alarm noise to try to force them toward the ocean. Eventually, the whales headed downriver on their own. Marine biologists and veterinarians worried for the whales&#39; health as they lingered in the river. Both animals had cuts on their backs, probably from boat propellers, and they developed skin blisters from the fresh water. The whales were given injections of antibiotics to stave off infections. ``As far as letting nature take its own course and letting them die, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an option because their injuries are a result of human activities,&#39;&#39; Frances Gulland, director of veterinary science at the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, said during a May 23 press briefing. ``We have some obligation to compensate for what we&#39;ve done to these animals.&#39;&#39; Humpback whales, which can live as long as 80 years and weigh as much as 30 tons, were hunted to near extinction until they were listed as an endangered species in the 1960s. There are less than 6,000 left in the Pacific Ocean, according to the Marine Mammal Center. The whales startled rescuers on May 27 by swimming more than 24 miles downstream, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. They moved south along the delta of the Sacramento River, California&#39;s largest, and entered bay waters yesterday. A flotilla of 12 boats accompanied them to offer protection from large ships, and to prevent the animals from turning back in the wrong direction. As the duo returned to saltier waters, their skin conditions improved, Oswald said. When the whales were marooned, crowds gathered at marinas in Rio Vista and the Port of Sacramento, trying to catch a glimpse of the 45-foot (13.7-meter) mother and the 25-foot calf. During the rescue effort, more than 2,600 suggestions from the public poured into a special e-mail account set up by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. One e-mail suggested using helicopters to harass the animals downriver, while another proposed building a fake whale with an outboard motor to lead them to the Pacific. A Navy dolphin squad might be able to guide the whales home, according to one e-mail. And a psychic asked to read the whales&#39; minds. ``There have been some real interesting folks who&#39;ve contacted us,&#39;&#39; Fees said. The rescue team included the Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration personnel, the state Department of Fish and Game and the Governor&#39;s Office of Emergency Services, as well as local law enforcement.

The 2.5-pound &#8220;appliance&#8221; comes with a 10-inch screen and is meant to be a companion for a smartphone, according to one of Palm&#8217;s founders, Jeff Hawkins, who introduced the machine here at the D: All Things Digital technology industry conference. The Foleo, which will be priced starting at $499, synchronizes information with Palm and Windows Mobile phones and can be linked wirelessly via phones to the Internet, although it comes with During a demonstration, Mr. Hawkins acknowledged the limitations of smartphones, which have been viewed as a lighter, less expensive alternative to carrying a portable laptop computer. &#8220;Sometimes you need a big screen,&#8221; Mr. Hawkins said. He said he had struck on the idea of a mobile companion for the phone five years ago, but that his business partners Donna Dubinsky and Ed Colligan had resisted the project as a distraction while the company introduced the popular The Foleo, which will go on sale this summer, is based on the Linux operating system. But it does not have a broad range of applications. For example, while Mr. Hawkins demonstrated the ability to synchronize e-mail automatically with a smartphone, synchronizing with a datebook was not a feature. The notion of an inch-thick device that is sold as a peripheral to a phone generated some skepticism. But several analysts saidt the phone might get a following of Linux enthusiasts. &#8220;This could become the first commercially viable portable Linux system,&#8221; said Tim Bajarin, an industry analyst at Creative Strategies, a consulting firm based in Campbell, Calif. The Foleo is the latest in a series of industry efforts to define a new category between cellphones and laptops. has tried to create interest in devices it calls ultra-mobile PCs, and has been encouraging developers to introduce systems it describes as mobile Internet devices. Several smaller start-up companies like Oqo, based in San Francisco, have also been offering hand-held systems that have most of the features of standard laptops, but fit comfortably in jacket pockets. This year&#8217;s conference also included an interview with . Mr. Jobs said his company would soon be focused on three business &#151; computers, digital music, and cellular telephone handsets &#151; and &#8220;a hobby,&#8221; the company&#8217;s recently introduced Apple TV peripheral. He called the device an experiment and said it would soon make it possible to download videos from the YouTube site of onto a home TV. He described efforts by PC and consumer electronics companies and others to replace the cable set-top box as failures. Apple has recently reset its strategy and is going to try to shape Apple TV as something other than a conduit for television. &#8220;We want to be the DVD player for the Internet age,&#8221; he said. Mr. Jobs also said that more than two hundred million copies of the Apple iTunes software had been downloaded, with most of them running on Windows-based personal computers. He did not let that fact pass without taking a not-so-subtle jab at his long-time competitor, , Microsoft&#8217;s founder: Offering iTunes software to Windows users was like &#8220;offering a glass of water to someone in hell,&#8221; Mr. Jobs said.

Is &#163;40 the right amount to pay for a loudspeaker screw?

Don't bother getting more than 3GB of Ram Councils bypass Ordnance Survey for Google Maps Which laptop per child? What is the real failure rate of the Xbox 360? Thursday asked Game, one of the largest console retailers in the UK. "That's not information we're able to give out. It's commercially sensitive," it said. As for Microsoft, in the early days after the console's 2005 launch it claimed that failure rates were no higher than an industry average of between 3% and 5%. That now seems wildly optimistic. Last month, its vice-president of entertainment, Peter Moore, refused to answer the question, telling the Mercury News: "I can't comment on failure rates." According to Moore, if someone has a faulty console they should worry about the customer service. Anecdotal evidence about how many have suffered the "red ring of death", where the power button sticks on red, not green, is hard to assess because it is those with faulty boxes who make most noise, but Microsoft seems to have a problem. A notable feature of surveys such as one conducted recently by the magazine is that multiple failures are common, with some users on their sixth or seventh console. Third-party repair specialists also cast doubt on the 360's reliability. Simon Donn at Undercutter UK in London Colney, Hertfordshire, says: "There's a particular problem in relation to overheating. Quite often it's to do with the soldering on the board, and the fact that the fans, which are already very loud, can't seem to extract enough air. " In a statement, Microsoft said "there is not a single root cause or systemic issue with any of the Xbox 360 consoles ... there are obviously many things that can malfunction at any given time." Initial quality problems are unsurprising with a games console rushed to market, but 18 months later shouldn't such issues be resolved? Nobody we spoke to seems confident. Another problem relates to the 360's Digital Rights Management. When you buy downloadable content, such as a game from the Xbox Live Arcade, it comes with a usage restriction. It is fully unlocked for the console to which it is downloaded, even for offline use or for users with separate profiles. But if the machine breaks and you replace it, the game is only unlocked when the original buyer is logged into Xbox Live. That may seem a subtle distinction, but it enrages users who discover that their warranty replacement does not restore full rights to what they have paid for. "It is this single issue, and the way that Microsoft has handled it, that has convinced me that this will be the last MS console I will own," says one disillusioned user on Microsoft's official , in a thread with more than 2,000 posts. The solution is to find a third-party repairer who will return your actual machine, rather than a new or refurbished model - but that means spending money, which seems unreasonable during the warranty period.

Gates Shows Off 'Surface' Table Computer Microsoft Unveils New 'Surface' Computer Computer In Table Lets Users Grab Objects Microsoft Surface Computer Doesn't Need Keyboard POSTED: 12:38 pm EDT May 30, 2007 Microsoft unveiled early Wednesday morning a new kind of computer called Surface. Microsoft Unveils New 'Surface' Computer The coffee-table shaped computer responds to touch and bar codes attached to everyday objects. The machines got its public debut at a technology conference in Carlsbad, Calif. Surface is set to arrive in November in T-Mobile USA stores and properties owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide and Harrah's Entertainment. Surface is essentially a Windows-based PC tucked inside a table base, topped with a 30-inch touchscreen in a clear frame. Five cameras that can sense nearby objects are mounted beneath the screen. Unlike most touchscreens, Surface can respond to more than one touch at a time. Videos of the concept last year showed that people could easily drag and drop objects on the screen with their fingers, even grabbing more than one. It also allows for gestures such as squeezing fingers together to zoom in. The concept also included pressure sensitivity that could change what happens based on how hard someone presses. In the earlier demonstration, a keyboard could be projected on the screen -- and enlarged or shrunk -- to input text. Distributed by Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc.

The Russian astronauts undertook the spacewalk installing Service Module Debris Protection (SMDP) panels and rerouting a Global Positioning System antenna cable. Wednesday's spacewalk marks the first spacewalk for both Yurchikhin and Kotov. Additional SMDP panels will be installed on Zvezda during a second spacewalk on June six. During that spacewalk Yurchikhin and Kotov also will install a section of an Ethernet cable on the Zarya module and a Russian experiment called Biorisk on Pirs. Six SMDPs from bundle No 1 were installed during an August 16, 2002, spacewalk by Expedition 5 Commander Valery Korzun and Flight Engineer Peggy Whitson. Those SMDPs were delivered to the station by Endeavour during STS-111 in June 2002. The remaining three bundles and their adaptor were delivered by Discovery during STS-116 last December and attached to PMA-3 by spacewalkers Bob Curbeam and Sunita Williams. Williams was intra vehicular officer for yesterday's spacewalk, advising and keeping the space walkers on schedule. After the installation task, the space walkers moved back to Pirs and into the airlock. Hatch closure marking the end of the spacewalk was at 8:30 pm.

Search the Web with Vignette StoryServer 5.0 Wed May 30 14:28:53 2007 FOX News Election Coverage - Evolution and Paleontology - The Human Body Send news tip to FOXNews.com NASA Chief Questions Whether Global Warming Is a Problem Thursday, on 15 nations Thursday to set greenhouse gas emission standards, the head of the U.S. space program went on national radio and questioned whether global warming really is a problem. "I have no doubt that global &#8212; that a trend of global warming exists," NASA administrator told National Public Radio's Morning Edition in an interview that aired early Thursday. "I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with." Bush later called for a series of meetings in the fall to set a target goal for greenhouse emission standards. The president delivered his remarks to U.S. Global Leadership Campaign at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, D.C., ahead of his Group of Eight summit in Germany next week.. Click here to listen to Griffin's comments. &#8220;The United States has taken the lead and that&#8217;s the message I&#8217;m going to take to the G-8,&#8221; Bush said. But Griffin, who heads an agency with a $16.5 billion budget, wondered whether global warming was an issue that needed to be grappled with at all. Bush Urges 15 Nations to Reach Global Emissions Goal by 2008 "To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn't change," Griffin said. "First of all, I don't think it's within the power of human beings to assure that the climate does not change, as millions of years of history have shown," he continued. "And second of all, I guess I would ask which human beings &#8212; where and when &#8212; are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take." One of NASA's duties is charting global climate change. "Nowhere in NASA's authorization, which of course governs what we do, is there anything at all telling us that we should take actions to affect climate change in either one way or another," he told NPR. "We study global climate change &#8212; that is in our authorization. We think we do it rather well. I'm proud of that, but NASA is not an agency chartered to, quote, battle climate change." David Mould, NASA's chief spokesman, told the Houston Chronicle that the administrator was attempting to characterize the agency's role in assessing environmental issues. Germany, the current president of the G-8, has offered a proposal that would lower emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Bush rejected that approach in favor of autumn meetings to set target standards.

Firefox 1.5 Gets Its Last Update Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more. Mozilla has plugged a few holes in Firefox 1.5.x for what ostensibly may turn out to be the last time. The final release of Firefox 1.5.0.12 accompanies the release of Mozilla's current standard bearer Firefox 2.0.0.4, both of which are being patched for at least five flaws. Only one is critical. Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-12 details a flaw about a memory crash that could potentially lead to arbitrary file execution. There is also a fixed flaw for a potential cross-site scripting issue that Mozilla has rated "high impact." According to the advisory, the addEventListener JavaScript method could be used to inject script into another site in violation of the browser's same-origin policy. A malicious user could then use that method to potentially modify or access private information. One particularly annoying bug related to Mozilla's form auto-complete function has also been repaired in the latest Firefox releases. Rated "low impact," the flaw could have enabled a denial-of-service attack. Filling a text field with millions of characters and submitting the form will cause the victim's browser to hang for up to several minutes while the form data is read, and this will happen the first time auto complete is triggered after every browser restart. The Firefox 1.5.0.12 release is expected to be the last official Mozilla release in the Firefox 1.5.x product line, which was in November 2005. The release of Firefox 2.x in October superseded 1.5.x as Mozilla's flagship browser line. "Mozilla typically maintains support for previous releases for six months after a major release," Mozilla developer Basil Hashem wrote in a mailing list posting. "Mozilla has previously extended the planned end of life for the 1.5.0.x series in order to accommodate some recent changes in update functionality." Mozilla will help its legacy users migrate to Firefox 2.x with an automatic browser update notice at some point in the next several weeks, prompting them to upgrade up to Firefox 2.0.0.4. to your browser search box Firefox 1.5 Gets Its Last Update Customize Your New Red Hat Fedora Google Updates AJAX Dev Tool Adobe Gives ColdFusion A Big Overhaul Complex Events?

Antarctica lost much more ice to the sea than it gained from snowfall according to a NASA survey done between 1992 and 2002. It also had a corresponding rise in sea level. The survey documented for the first time extensive thinning of the West Antarctic ice shelves. (Credit: NASA/SVS) From a combination of climate models, satellite data, and paleoclimate records the scientists conclude that the West Antarctic ice sheet, Arctic ice cover, and regions providing fresh water sources and species habitat are under threat from continued global warming. The research appears in the current issue of Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. Tipping points can occur during climate change when the climate reaches a state such that strong amplifying feedbacks are activated by only moderate additional warming. This study finds that global warming of 0.6&ordm;C in the past 30 years has been driven mainly by increasing greenhouse gases, and only moderate additional climate forcing is likely to set in motion disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet and Arctic sea ice. Amplifying feedbacks include increased absorption of sunlight as melting exposes darker surfaces and speedup of iceberg discharge as the warming ocean melts ice shelves that otherwise inhibit ice flow. The researchers used data on earlier warm periods in Earth&rsquo;s history to estimate climate impacts as a function of global temperature, climate models to simulate global warming, and satellite data to verify ongoing changes. Lead author James Hansen, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, New York, concludes: &ldquo;If global emissions of carbon dioxide continue to rise at the rate of the past decade, this research shows that there will be disastrous effects, including increasingly rapid sea level rise, increased frequency of droughts and floods, and increased stress on wildlife and plants due to rapidly shifting climate zones.&rdquo; The researchers also investigate what would be needed to avert large climate change, thus helping define practical implications of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That treaty, signed in 1992 by the United States and almost all nations of the world, has the goal to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gases &ldquo;at a level that prevents dangerous human-made interference with the climate system.&rdquo; Based on climate model studies and the history of the Earth the authors conclude that additional global warming of about 1&ordm;C (1.8&ordm;F) or more, above global temperature in 2000, is likely to be dangerous. In turn, the temperature limit has implications for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO ), which has already increased from the pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million (ppm) to 383 ppm today and is rising by about 2 ppm per year. According to study co-author Makiko Sato of Columbia&rsquo;s Earth Institute, &ldquo;the temperature limit implies that CO exceeding 450 ppm is almost surely dangerous, and the ceiling may be even lower.&rdquo; The study also shows that the reduction of non-carbon dioxide forcings such as methane and black soot can offset some CO increase, but only to a limited extent. Hansen notes that &ldquo;we probably need a full court press on both CO emission rates and non-CO forcings, to avoid tipping points and save Arctic sea ice and the West Antarctic ice sheet.&rdquo; A computer model developed by the Goddard Institute was used to simulate climate from 1880 through today. The model included a more comprehensive set of natural and human-made climate forcings than previous studies, including changes in solar radiation, volcanic particles, human-made greenhouse gases, fine particles such as soot, the effect of the particles on clouds and land use. Extensive evaluation of the model&rsquo;s ability to simulate climate change is contained in a companion paper to be published in Climate Dynamics. The authors use the model for climate simulations of the 21st century using both &lsquo;business-as-usual&rsquo; growth of greenhouse gas emissions and an &lsquo;alternative scenario&rsquo; in which emissions decrease slowly in the next few decades and then rapidly to achieve stabilization of atmospheric CO amount by the end of the century. Climate changes are so large with &lsquo;business-as-usual&rsquo;, with additional global warming of 2-3&ordm;C (3.6-5.4&ordm;F) that Hansen concludes &ldquo;&lsquo;business-as-usual&rsquo; would be a guarantee of global and regional disasters.&rdquo; However, the study finds much less severe climate change &ndash; one-quarter to one-third that of the "business-as-usual" scenario &ndash; when greenhouse gas emissions follow the alternative scenario. &ldquo;Climate effects may still be substantial in the 'alternative scenario&rsquo;, but there is a better chance to adapt to the changes and find other ways to further reduce the climate change,&rdquo; said Sato. While the researchers say it is still possible to achieve the &ldquo;alternative scenario,&rdquo; they note that significant actions will be required to do so. Emissions must begin to slow soon. &ldquo;With another decade of &lsquo;business-as-usual&rsquo; it becomes impractical to achieve the &lsquo;alternative scenario&rsquo; because of the energy infrastructure that would be in place&rdquo; says Hansen.

By Eric Bailey, Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTO &#8212; They came, they wandered, they went. After a 17-day sojourn in Northern California's inland waterways, two wayward humpback whales that caught the attention of the nation appear to have quietly slipped back into the Pacific Ocean. By late Wednesday, nearly 24 hours after they were last sighted off the Marin County town of Tiburon, the mother and her calf were nowhere to be seen. Most of the experts mounting a rescue operation concluded that the pair had found their way back to their ocean home. A pair of patrol boats from the U.S. Coast Guard and California Department of Fish and Game hunted the waters off the coast for any sign of the pair, while vessels crisscrossing San Francisco Bay were asked to notify authorities of any sighting. Not a tail slap, spout or sky-scratching breach was seen. "They arrived here quietly, and if they've made their way outside the Golden Gate, they've gone out quietly," said Bernadette Fees, a state Fish and Game spokeswoman. First spotted swimming languidly May 13, the pair arrived in the Sacramento River sporting deep gashes likely inflicted by a run-in with a ship. They wandered into a deep-water shipping channel and into the Port of Sacramento, meandering 70 miles from the sea. In the days that followed, whale experts from around the nation descended on the area to lend a hand. The rescue team received thousands of e-mails and calls from the public, expressing concern and offering suggestions. Northern Californians took off workdays to perch on riverbank levees to get a glimpse. Experts faced a tough balance between giving the whales room to relax and heal and trying to persuade them to head back to their natural saline environment, where their wounds would better heal. The rescue team used clanking pipes, recordings of killer whales and even the geyser spray of a fireboat in an unsuccessful bid to prod the whales past what became their biggest obstacle &#8212; a bustling bridge at Rio Vista. Scientists grew worried late last week as the pair's health continued to deteriorate. By the weekend, the team resorted to administering a dose of antibiotics &#8212; a first for whales in the wild &#8212; delivered with foot-long syringes shot from a .22-caliber rifle. They prepared to launch a massive post-Memorial Day push to move the whales. The whales beat them to the punch. On Sunday, they made their break amid the buzz of holiday jet skiers and boaters on the river. Over three days, they moved purposefully down the river, through the narrow Carquinez Strait and into San Francisco Bay. Seeming to gain vigor, the 20-foot-long juvenile put on a display of leaps and tail slaps as if at play. Tara Cahn, a Sausalito architect, jumped in her car upon learning that the whales were swimming along the Marin County coast. After a few wrong turns, she finally tracked them down Tuesday evening about a quarter-mile offshore of Tiburon. "They were bouncing around, they were playing, they were spouting," said Cahn, who on Wednesday was out looking for them again. "I've been whale watching on Monterey Bay, and this was far more exciting." Scientists say the pair's health rebounded after they returned to the bay's soothing saltwater. Their skin, which grew pitted during their trip up the Sacramento River, was looking slick and slippery by Tuesday evening. "We're still holding our breath a little bit, but we're just so pleased," said Trevor Spradlin, a marine mammal biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, the federal agency that helped lead the rescue effort. Spradlin said scientists are coming away with a treasure trove of insights and observations that will fuel months of research. "We will rigorously and systematically document this case. Really, the only other reference point was Humphrey, and that was a long time ago," he said, referring to the wayward humpback that spent nearly a month in the delta in 1985.

Apple began selling thousands of songs without copy protection yesterday, just as the tech darling's iPhone was getting a breathless boost from AT&T. The California company's iTunes Store launched the new song-selling strategy with music from EMI's massive catalogue, including works by the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and Coldplay. Free of digital rights management, or DRM, technology, the songs will cost 30 cents more than restricted songs, but will be playable on virtually any digital music player. In a separate development, a top AT&T official declared expectations for the iPhone, due out at the end of next month and distributed by AT&T, are "too low." "The iPhone is going to be a game-changer," added AT&T Chief Operating Officer Randall Stephenson, who spoke at an investor conference in New York. Next year, Apple expects to sell 10 million of the iPhones, which blend a mobile phone with the iPod music player. The iPhone will cost up to $499. AT&T's wireless unit, formerly known as Cingular, plans to use the iPhone to recruit subscribers. It now has 62.2 million wireless customers, the most in the U.S. The strong words of praise for the iPhone helped, but it analysts said it was mostly iTunes new sales pitch that propelled the company's shares in heavy trading yesterday. Apple stock rose nearly 4.5%, to a 52-week high of $118.77. Songs sold by iTunes free of restrictions will work for the first time directly on portable players other than Apple's iPod, including Microsoft's Zune. Analysts predicted that other digital music sellers will have little choice but to follow suit. The DRM-free tracks feature a higher sound quality and cost $1.29 apiece, compared to the usual 99-cent price. If available, users could upgrade existing purchases to DRM-free versions for 30 cents a song or $3 for most albums, Apple said. Earlier this year, Apple CEO Steve Jobs called on the four major record companies to sell songs online without copy-protection software. Yesterday, Jobs reiterated Apple expects that more than half of the 5 million songs on iTunes will feature a DRM-free version by the end of the year.

PSP 3.50 firmware available: "Remote Play" over the Internet Posted May 31st 2007 4:26AM by Just released in Japan, Sony's 3.50 firmware for the should making the global rounds soon enough. That, coupled with the latest PS3 firmware update, means you've just scored "Remote Play" functionality -- access to videos, music, and pictures on your home PS3 running -- over the Internet. In other words, you can stream media but can't actually play games remotely. The update also includes an RSS Channel Guide but we know it's the remote play you want. The new firmware should already be available via your PSP's Network Update option even though many of Sony's download sites are still pegged at version 3.40.

May 31st 2007 7:25AM Now someone has to incorporate RemotePlay into MythTV May 31st 2007 7:36AM I'm downloading it now... in the US. May 31st 2007 7:40AM Wow, finally someone on the Engadget team who can spell Internet right. May 31st 2007 8:08AM I don't understand this. Does your PS3 have to remain ON and sucking power all the time in case you may want to access a few short videos? Why not upload them to Youtube instead? Then you'll be able to access them from anything, and not just a PSP and you won't have to leave your PS3 on all the time. May 31st 2007 8:19AM Can a PSP watch videos on YOUTUBE? View Comment in Thread May 31st 2007 8:41AM im still waiting to see if Joost would work on psp!!! May 31st 2007 8:57AM Kamalot: YouTube does not work on my psp... I won't be accessing a few short videos, my brother has a psp and lives 100 miles away, this way he can view files i upload on my ps3, i.e family home videos and more. He can also check out files on my pc through the media server. I'm not bothered about playing ps3 games on the psp, if it could do that.. i'd be worried about how i supposedly bought "advanced technology" when the psp can render the games. By the way.. downloaded it and it works great! May 31st 2007 9:39AM So you can access your media server as well from your PSP through the PS3? Awesome. View Comment in Thread May 31st 2007 9:41AM I wouldn't need to render the graphics, it would just stream the video. Like when you watch an animated movie like "Toy Story", you aren't actually rendering the graphics. May 31st 2007 10:03AM Awesome! Can't wait to get home and fire my PSP up. The promise of this type of functionality was one of the reasons I bought my PSP and PS3. How cool is it to be able to pull up family photos, home movies, and music from a world away. May 31st 2007 10:45AM The PS3 and PSP shared remote play capabilities since the last update. The only difference I noticed with 1.8 is that my PSP connected on the first try as opposed to the second. May 31st 2007 10:57AM Got mine to work installing TVersity & ffmpeg on my PC. Xvid movies on PC -> PS3 -> internet -> on my PSP via WiFi May 31st 2007 11:24AM Downloaded it and it works GREAT, nice little update. Now what they need to do is add "Wake on Lan" and sleep mode to the PS3. This way I can put my PS3 to sleep and it wakes up when I connect to it with my PSP. May 31st 2007 11:47AM Wake On LAN and auto sleep mode were supposed to be included with the release. I take it they weren't? Man, I wish I wasn't at work right now... May 31st 2007 12:27PM Yes, I know it's says PS3 but... Will this work with a Vista media server somehow? Please keep your comments relevant to this blog entry.

Top Spammer Soloway arrested by Feds in Seattle Thursday, May 31st, 2007 A man who ironically has the distinction of being one of the worldâs most prolific spammers has been arrested and in fact U.S. authorities went on to say that computer users across the internet did observe a drop in the amount of junk e-mail. 27 year-old Robert Alan Soloway, has been alleged of using networks of compromised &#8220;zombie'&#8217; computers to send out millions of spam e-mails. Interestingly Soloway of Washington, is the founder of the so-called &#8220;Strategic Partnership Against Microsoft Illegal Spam&#8221;, or SPAMIS, but is himself said to be one of the Internet&#8217;s biggest spammers through his company, Newport Internet Marketing. Tim Cranton, a Microsoft Corp. lawyer who is senior director of the company&#8217;s Worldwide Internet Safety Programs said, &#8220;He&#8217;s one of the top 10 spammers in the world.'&#8217; Adding, &#8220;He&#8217;s a huge problem for our customers. This is a very good day.'&#8217; A federal grand jury last week returned a 35-count indictment against Soloway charging him with mail fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering. On Wednesday afternoon, Soloway pleaded not guilty to all charges after a judge affirmed that even after four bank accounts seized by the government, the spammer was well sufficient to pay for his own lawyer. Touted as the âSpam King,â Solowayâs prosperity can be guessed through his living style and assets. Soloway has been living in a swanky apartment and drives an expensive Mercedes convertible, said prosecutor Kathryn Warma. Prosecutors are looking to have him forfeit $773,000 (euro576,005) they say he made from his business, Newport Internet Marketing Corp. &#8220;Our investigators dubbed him the &#8216;Spam King&#8217; because he is responsible for millions of spam emails,&#8221; said US Attorney for the Western District of Washington Jeffrey Sullivan A public defender who represented him for Wednesday&#8217;s hearing declined to comment. Between November of 2003 and May of 2007 Soloway &#8217;spammed&#8217; tens of millions of email messages to promote websites at which his company, Newport Internet Marketing, sold products and services, according to prosecutors. The computers are termed as &#8220;zombies'&#8217; because owners typically have no idea their machines have been infected. Soloway used the networks of compromised computers to send out unsolicited bulk e-mails urging people to use his internet marketing company to advertise their products, authorities said. People who clicked on a link in the e-mail were directed to his website. There, Soloway advertised his ability to send out as many as 20 million e-mail advertisements over 15 days for $495 (euro368), the indictment said. The Spamhaus Project were delighted at his arrest. &#8220;Soloway has been a long-term nuisance on the Internet - both in terms of the spam he sent, and the people he duped to use his spam service,&#8221; organizers wrote on Spamhaus.org. However this is not the first time that Soloway is facing the legal wrath. In 2005, Microsoft won a $7 million civil judgment against him and the operator of a small Internet service provider in Oklahoma won a $10 million judgment. However, none of these incidences deterred Solowayâs intentions and he went on with his activities as before. U.S. Attorney Jeff Sullivan , this case is the first in the country in which federal prosecutors have used identity theft statutes to indict a spammer for taking over someone else&#8217;s Internet domain name. If convicted as charged, Soloway will face a maximum sentence of more than 65 years in prison and a fine of $US250,000. Prosecutors want to seize approximately $US773,000 they say Soloway made from his spamming-related activities. Soloway remained in federal detention pending a hearing Monday. | You can skip to the end and leave a response. Pinging is currently not allowed.

Soloway's arrest will help, Levine said, but with spam increasing so much over the past few years, his arrest "won't make much difference." FDA Nixes Fast Track for Cancer Vaccine Ban on Selling Wildlife Might Fuel Trade Nine Hurricanes Forecast for 2007 Cancer Expected to Skyrocket in Asia Space Station Gets Protective Panels with HP's All-in-One Storage Systems. Simple and affordable ways to set I.T. free. Robert Alan Soloway, a 27-year-old Seattle resident dubbed "Spam King" by federal agents, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with multiple counts of fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering. If convicted on the various counts, Soloway could face decades in prison. "It's good news for consumers," said John Levine, a board member of the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail (CAUCE). "Soloway has been taunting the antispam community and federal officials for years, essentially daring them to come after him, and they finally did." In a 24-page indictment filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Washington, U.S. Attorney Jeffrey C. Sullivan said that Soloway has been operating his illegal scheme since November 2003, and sent out tens of millions of spam e-mails in an effort to drum up business for his e-mail advertising software (which in turn would send out additional spam). Educating Juries on E-Mail Levine said that given Soloway's notoriety and relatively high profile, CAUCE had been wondering why it was taking so long for federal authorities to take action against him. "And now we know," Levine said. "Federal agents were building a very detailed and thorough list of charges that is not likely to fall apart at trial." The other challenge for federal prosecutors is the complexity of Internet-based fraud cases. Levine said that he served as a technical expert on one of the first spam cases in Virginia and prosecutors "spent a fortune" educating the jury on the technology involved. "It's definitely a little more complicated than 'A man walks into a bank with a gun and walks out with money,'" Levine said. "But I think that it will get steadily easier for federal prosecutors to bring these cases as the technology becomes more familiar to people." Not A CAN-SPAM Case What might surprise some people is that despite the fact that it involves e-mail and one of the nation's top spammers, the CAN-SPAM Act plays a minor role. "If you read the indictment," Levine pointed out, "the CAN-SPAM Act is barely mentioned. That reaffirms what CAUCE has been saying, that the CAN-SPAM Act is not in fact an effective law enforcement statute. Instead, this case is built on traditional criminal offenses like wire fraud and money laundering." At an arraignment on Wednesday afternoon, Soloway pleaded not guilty to all charges and was ordered held until a hearing on Monday. In addition to seeking Soloway's conviction on the various charges, the government is also looking to recover $773,000 that it says Soloway earned from his fraudulent business. Some reports have suggested that Soloway's arrest will cause a noticeable decrease in spam, but Levine suggested that any decline would unfortunately be minimal. "There's no question that [Soloway's] been responsible for a lot of spam," Levine said, "and his arrest will help. But the amount of spam has increased so much over the last couple of years that even his arrest won't make much difference." Increase visitor confidence on your site with the green address bar.

"We have good news and we have no news," said Bernadette Fees, a spokeswoman with California's fish and game authority. VIDEO: Bound for open sea Whale sanctuary bid fails "We haven't sighted the whales this morning, so there is a possibility that they have made their way back out to their natural environment," she said. Wildlife officials had been attempting to herd the injured whales back to the ocean since they swam up the Sacramento River, deep in California's central valley, on May 15. It is believed that the mother and her calf, dubbed "Delta" and "Dawn" by scientists, had been injured by a passing boat. Biologists deployed a new technique at the weekend of directing the whales by spraying water some 300 meters (yards) ahead of them after earlier failing to direct them by playing recordings of humpbacks feeding, and by banging steel pipes to create offensive sounds. Experts are at a loss to explain why the two whales, which had been heading north on their spring migratory route which runs from Mexico along California into the northern Pacific, swam under the Golden Gate Bridge and through the San Francisco Bay to the Sacramento River.

At the same time, Microsoft has added new photo-realistic three-dimensional imaging to its mapping service in what is becoming a race to grab a larger slice of the rapidly growing digital cartography market. Google has launched the Street View application for Google Maps, which provides a street level picture of downtown areas of New York, Denver, San Francisco, Las Vegas and Miami. Users are able to view and navigate with a 360-degree view of the selected cities. Google said it planned to roll out the service to metropolitan areas in other Google regions including Australia although there was no timetable as yet. "With Street View, you can virtually explore city neighbourhoods by viewing and navigating within 360-degree scenes of street-level imagery," Google product manager Stephen Chau said on the company's Lat Long blog. "It feels as if you're walking down the street." The panoramic pictures appear to have been taken in late morning conditions and were captured by a moving vehicle driving public streets equipped with imaging technology. Almost simultaneously, Microsoft Live Search Maps has began offering views of cities with a perspective it says "few people apart from Superman have ever seen". Microsoft's map service provides birds-eye views of cities in Britain, Canada, and the US and will expand to include more cities worldwide. The free Microsoft maps come with services for finding businesses, reviews and directions. Live Maps already incorporates street-level imagery into its service. Google also launched Mapplets, a new tool that enables developers to create applications that can overlay a range of information on Google Maps. Some of the applications featured on Google's preview page displayed earthquake data, movie times for US cities, crime statistics and house listings. By selecting data overlays from a gallery of applications - many created by non-Google sources - users can create what is commonly known as a "mashup", a web device that combines content from more than one source. Mapplets also includes an application that can measure distances between points on the map. Google product manager Thai Tran said despite some of the great innovations third-party developers had been creating, most users remained unaware of just what they were able to do with Google Maps. "One day we were looking at two of the original Google Maps mashups, HousingMaps.com and ChicagoCrime.org, and we realised it would be even more useful if they could be combined because most people wouldn't want to live near high crime areas," Mr Tran said on the Lat Long blog. Australia is one of 11 countries where Mapplets will be available.

A browser plugin is available for both IE and Firefox and works on Windows, Mac and Linux machines. In conjunction with the , Google has updated Google Reader to offer offline support for reading RSS feeds. But the technology is not limited to just Google apps. Like other APIs, Google is offering as a free, open source platform that can be used by any web application. Using Gears, web developers now have access to a toolkit which enables them to take advantage of offline capabilities such as local file storage and caching, a client-side SQL database and asynchronous background processes. From the user side the new plug-in comes with a domain selection tool similar to that of Mozilla&#8217;s add-on tools. Only approved domains can store information, though for now there are no fine-grained tools like storage size limits or per-app permissions. Also worth noting, the installation server is not a URL which means the new plug-in is potentially vulnerable to the scripting exploits recently discovered in Firefox plugins . Hopefully Google will address that oversight in the near future. So far the Gears toolkit only works with Firefox and IE, but support for Opera and Safari is in the works. In fact, Google says it will submit the code behind Gears to a standards body and hopes that eventually the functionality will be built into all standards-compliant browsers. For the time being Gears is a beta, but Google hopes to have a consumer-ready version available in the next few months. While utilizing Google Reader offline is nice, the real power of Gears will likely come from integration with the Google Docs and Google Spreadsheet applications. Offline access to Google Docs would solve one the the chief complaints about the service. It will be interesting to see how Gears ends up being used, but one thing is for certain, it opens a lot of doors to developers looking to bridge the narrowing gap between desktop and web-based applications. Site level permissions in Gears Sites will ask permission before utilizing Gears. Enabling Gears functionality in Google Reader Should you lose your internet connection while browsing Reader, the page will ask if you'd like to transition to offline mode. Regrettably, offline mode seems to require manual synchronization.

According to the NYT, a growing number of content providers are adapting steamy images and video for use on mobile phones, but the major phone operators are blanching at the images and at providing access to new video games that are violent, explicit and designed for phones, like one based on the movie "Kill Bill." Cingular Wireless, the US's largest carrier, said earlier this month that it would stop offering customers the option of downloading images of pornography-film stars, a service that had been offered by AT&T Wireless, which Cingular, owned by SBC Communications and BellSouth, bought in October. Historically, telephone carriers in the US have not been allowed to censor what people say over the telephone or what phone numbers they call and, similarly, the Federal Communications Commission has said that mobile phone operators cannot censor what sites consumers visit on the internet. However, the F.C.C. said no rule governed what content the carriers could sponsor and sell themselves.

NOAA Facts: Humpback Whales Thousands Gather To See Whales Wayward Whales Reach SF Bay Mother, Calf Close In On Ocean POSTED: 10:47 pm EDT May 29, 2007 UPDATED: 10:49 pm EDT May 29, 2007 Two lost whales are closing in on their ocean home. The mother humpback and her calf have entered San Francisco Bay after passing under the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. If the humpbacks can navigate south around a peninsula and an island, few obstacles would remain on their route past Alcatraz to the Golden Gate, the strait that connects San Francisco Bay to the Pacific Ocean. Still, the fear remains that the whales might head south instead of west, passing under the Bay Bridge and into the long southern half of the bay. As of Tuesday evening, the whales were spotted swimming about 10 miles from the Golden Gate. The whale and her calf had been spotted in the river May 13 and got as far as 90 miles inland to the Port of Sacramento before turning around. . All rights reserved.

See Todd Bishop's blog for video highlights Rivals for three decades, the two executives have rarely appeared in public together and have generally been viewed as bitter rivals, despite occasional partnerships. In front of about 600 technology executives at the D: All Things Digital conference, which was sponsored by The Wall Street Journal, the two executives attracted the attention usually reserved for rock singers and Hollywood stars. However, attendees who came hoping for fireworks or a confrontation were disappointed. The mild tone to the session did not take anything away from the event, and after discussing the past and present of the computing industry, the two were greeted with a standing ovation. Gates and Jobs largely pioneered the personal-computer industry beginning in 1975 and 1976, and they spent part of the evening sharing memories of those days. Today "we ship these computers with 1 or 2 gigabytes and nobody remembers 128 kilobytes," Jobs said. Apple and Microsoft were business partners at the start of the computer era beginning in 1977 when Gates supplied a copy of the BASIC programming language for the Apple II computer. Later, Gates made an early bet on writing software for the Macintosh, two years before the computer was introduced in 1984. Neither was willing to acknowledge the possibility that the personal-computer era they helped create would end any time soon. "The PC has proven to be very resilient," Jobs said. At the same time, they called themselves believers in the explosion of hand-held communications devices, also known as "Post PC devices." Gates said he was sometimes frustrated by the fact that the players in the industry changed so quickly. "I miss it when people come and go. It's nice when people stick around, and it gives us some context," he said. Neither man was willing to say harsh things about the other, and Jobs summed up his feelings by quoting from the Beatles' song "Two of Us": " 'You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead'; that's clearly true here," he said. Jobs is widely credited for Apple's renaissance with a string of innovative products -- the iMac computer for consumers, the powerful PowerMac and PowerBook and the iPod digital music player. Microsoft has long dominated with its Windows operating system and software programs such as Word and Excel, but Apple scored big with its iPod, introduced in 2001, and its iTunes online music store. Next month, Apple introduces its much-anticipated iPhone mobile handset. This report includes information from The Associated Press.

AMD Chips to be used in Toshiba&#8217;s Entry-level Notebook Computers Wednesday, May 30th, 2007 Toshiba, the worldâs fourth-largest notebook computer maker has announced its plans to use Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) computer microprocessors in some of its laptops. With this announcement Toshiba has made it clear that it is ending its ties with Intel Corp. as an exclusive provider for the chips that power most of its laptop computers The exclusive agreement with Intel began way back in 2001. Now, Tokyo-based spokeswoman Junko Furuta confirmed that Toshiba will use AMDâs chips in around 20 per cent of its laptop models sold in the US and Europe. The microprocessors, which are the main brains of computers, will be used for Toshibaâs low-priced models from this summer onwards, she said. However, details of the new model are extremely sketch and she also declined to give any more information. Toshiba last used AMDâs chips around seven years ago. Since Toshiba happens to be the fourth-largest notebook manufacturer in the world, the bit of news will definitely be a public relations boost for chip-maker AMD. Incidentally, Taiwanâs Acer, the third-largest notebook manufacturer in the world, also uses AMD chips. Yuichi Ishida, an analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities , âThe use of Advanced Microâs chips will lead to a reduction in procurement costs. Lower costs and a possible increase in sales during the Christmas shopping season may help improve profitability at Toshibaâs computer business.â The report claimed that Toshiba intends to begin using AMD processors in about 20% of its notebooks in the US and Europe that inlcude three Satellite laptops using AMD&#8217;s dual-core mobile Turion 64 X2 processor and AMD&#8217;s M690 core-logic chipset. However, Toshiba is expected to continue using Intel on their high performance machines. | You can skip to the end and leave a response. Pinging is currently not allowed.

Kevin Rose Wants To Take Digg Beyond The News &raquo; Microsoft Bullying Defeats ODF Legislation June 04, 2007 | 8:19:44 AM Microsoft has successfully defeated a number of attempts to mandate ODF format documents for official U.S. State documents. Thanks to heavy lobbying by the Redmond giant, bills in California, Connecticut, Florida, Texas and Oregon have all been shelved, stalled indefinitely or tossed out the window entirely. Only Minnesota passed pro-ODF legislation and even then it was a severely watered-down bill which merely calls for the state&#8217;s IT officials to look into the debate. Computer World has a on Microsoft&#8217;s efforts to defeat the bills by creating mock grassroots support, including a series of letters supposedly &#8220;written by small businesses against the proposed legislation &#8212; letters that turned out to have been penned by Microsoft resellers and partners.&#8221; The letters were sent after an both failed to garner any support for Microsoft&#8217;s proprietary format OOXML &#8212; the company&#8217;s ODF competitor. But the real problem may have been with the legislators who didn&#8217;t understand the debate. According to some legislators quoted in the Computer World story, the lawmakers felt out of their elements in making decisions on technical issues, which shouldn&#8217;t really be surprising, but is disheartening nonetheless. Don Betzold, a Democratic state senator who sponsored the open formats proposal in Minnesota tells Computer World that he and other politicians felt overwhelmed by the technical jargon presented by each side. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t know an open document format if it bit me on the butt,&#8221; Betzold said. &#8220;We&#8217;re public policy experts. [Deciding technical standards] is not our job.&#8221; But despite the setbacks, Marino Marcich, executive director of the ODF Alliance, believes the legislative fight has only begun. MICROSOFT/WAL-MART/GOVERNMENT = MONSTER'S OF THEIR OWN DESIGN! THE BIGER THE ENTITY = THE MORE CRAP AND CORRUPTION THEY GET AWAY WITH. AND 'WE-THE-PEOPLE' HAVE BECOME A HERD OF BLIND SHEEP IE 'BIG-MOUTHS' WITH 'NO-BALLS'. AND MONEY CONTINUES TO BUY POWER AND CORRUPTION.

Pennsylvania Attorney General Tom Corbett served MySpace with a court order demanding the e-mails, which the company said it is constrained from providing under a federal law, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986. "We want Attorney General Corbett to get this information to provide them with whatever they need to use in their investigation," MySpace general counsel Mike Angus told Reuters. "The 9th Circuit has determined that ECPA requires a search warrant to produce private messages and unfortunately, in some cases, this is proving difficult. Absent an existing investigation, having the name of a registered sex offender isn&#39;t enough to produce a search warrant." MySpace has provided the e-mail correspondence in question to the Pennsylvania court, which it asked to further distribute to law enforcement at the court&#39;s discretion.

Click image: Jun 4th, 2007 - 18:13:57 Online advertising in UK, the Netherlands and Denmark exceeds 10% of total annual advertising spend but lags at 3.5% in Ireland Jun 4, 2007, 17:34 Alain Heureux, President of IAB Europe a federation of national web advertising groups, has used the platform of its Interact congress on digital marketing in Brussels today, Monday, 4 June, to announce the results of the first ever pan European online advertising spend study. Featuring data from 13 countries in the IAB Europe network, the study shows that in 2006, online advertising spend within the IAB Europe network was 8.003 billion (8,002.6 million). The study covers spend on display, classified and directories, search and email advertising. The data has been compiled by IAB Europe based on information provided by the regional IAB offices around and then analysed and processed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Today's report says that UK internet users are the most valuable in Europe to advertisers, attracting even more per capita advertising expenditure than online consumers in the US, home of the web. Advertisers spent an average 82.46 (£56) marketing to each active UK web user in 2006. The sum is more than twice the 39 spent marketing to each web surfer across the 13 European countries measured by the study. The comparable US figure was about 60 last year. The IAB/PwC study estimates that in a total of three European countries, the webs share of advertising expenditure exceeded 10% in 2006. These were the UK, the Netherlands and Denmark. Ireland's share was about 3.5%. study reveals that the country has the highest average number of daily visitors (21.8 million), the highest usage days per month (21 per user), and the highest average time spent per month per user (34.4 hours). The study shows, on an average day in April 2007, there were 122 million Europeans aged 15 or older online, versus 114 million in the The average European accessed the Internet from either a home or a work computer an average of 16.5 days in the month and spent a total of 24 hours viewing 2,662 Web pages. In comparison with our European neighbours, the and Scandinavian countries have the highest percentage of their populations using the Internet, ranging from 68 percent to 83 percent. has the largest online population: 32.6 million people age 15 and older. Countries that have usage days below the European average are (11.4 average usage days), The average Swedish user views 4,019 pages per month and views more pages than any other country. This is 51 per cent above the European average of 2,662 pages per month. Managing Director of comScore , Bob Ivins, said: This marks the first time we have released this detailed of a portrait of Internet usage across the 16 countries, making these comparisons truly revealing." The study also revealed that Google is the most popular property in 13 of the 16 countries, followed by Microsoft in most countries. Yahoo! remains the third most popular property across Europe, despite making the top 3 list in only three countries  The comScore study compares activity across the 16 countries where comScore tracks Internet usage with panel-based measurement and highlights the differences in Internet development by country. Country advertising spend breakdown accounted for the largest share of European online adspend, at 39% of the total (3.101 billion), accounting for 22% (1.752 billion) and France 15% (1,179 billion). The is Europes fourth largest market at 7% (564.3 million), closely followed by at 6% (480.2 million). account for the remaining 12% (927 million). Annual figures released by the Advertising Association last month show that the 's total advertising expenditure in 2006 was more than £19 billion (27.75). , the internet enjoyed the biggest spending upturn between 2005 and 2006 at 47.5 per cent year-on-year to £2.01 billion. The internet accounted for more than 10% of the annual advertising spend for the first time. Print media, which includes all magazines and newspapers, drew the highest advertising spend of 2006 at £8.34 billion - despite a 2.7% year-on-year drop. TV advertising spend dropped 4.7% year-on-year to £4.59 billion. This was the first dip in television advertising expenditure since 2001, according to the Advertising Association. The amount spent on direct mail advertising dropped 2.1% to £2.32 billion, while radio fell 7.7% to £534 million. Figures from the Irish advertising body, the IAPI show that advertisers spent 13.5 million online across 90 Irish websites last year, excluding Google, MSN, YouTube and other international websites and networks. Search engine marketing, meanwhile, is estimated to be worth 30 million a year in , according to Amarach Consulting. Total Irish advertising expenditure was 1.3 billion in 2006. 31% of online advertising spend in 2006 was on all forms of display advertising, 45% was on search advertising, with 22% on classifieds and directories, and 1.6% on email marketing. Having compiled figures from each of the National IAB online advertising spend benchmark studies in spring 2006, this year IAB Europe has gone one stage further in providing accurate and comparable data on the European market. They have taken into account the various methodologies used by the National IABs across to compile their reports and then made the necessary adjustments to the figures to ensure that they are correctly comparable, country by country. Alain Heureux, President of IAB Europe, said: These figures demonstrate without any doubt the significance of the European online advertising industry. The Interact Congress, the first of its kind, is the perfect platform for the presentation of this sectors growing success and delegates will go away from here with the tools, knowhow and inspiration to grow the Nicki Lynas, Manager (Entertainment and Media, PricewaterhouseCoopers) said: "PwC are excited to be working with the IAB on this advertising study. The total investment of Euro 8 billion demonstrates the rising importance of the internet as an advertising medium in , and we look forward to seeing how much larger the market will be in 2007." The Interact Congress is supported by the European Interactive Advertising Association (EIAA) as official partner. "Interactive Media is radically changing the way in which we market on a local, European and global basis. The Ad Ex project will be a valuable contribution to increasing our understanding of how the online medium is growing. The Interact event provides a unique platform where marketers can come together, grow their knowledge and share experience and we are delighted to be an official partner at Interact to support the European interactive business" Alison Fennah, Executive Director of the EIAA. How were the figures reached? Each national IAB runs its own annual online advertising spend benchmark study and the IAB Europe Ad Ex figure is based on these results. As the methodology for the studies varies country by country, the nature of this project is to represent the figures in such a way as to make them realistically comparable. Re adjusting figures to allow for different original methodologies Re adjustment rates have been supplied by groups of local market experts Estimating data for certain formats in certain countries where local IAB studies do not include data on a given format, weighted averages for similar markets have been applied to give an estimated value for the format IAB Europe is not re valuing the markets in these countries, but simply making the adjustments necessary to make the figures comparable What has been estimated? Of the total value given for these markets, 66% of the value is accounted for by actual data. Of the remaining data 21% has been adjusted to make it comparable, and 14% has been estimated. The adjustments and estimations are based on input from local markets or ratios based on weighted averages from other countries Other information about the figures: Figures quoted are gross figures (i.e. actual invoiced value of the media sold, including agency commission) All estimates and readjustments are conservative All estimates and readjustments have been subject to approval from local market experts and industry analysts We are confident that our figures are correct based on the IAB Europe networks knowledge of the market IAB Europe is a federation of 13 national IAB (Internet Advertising Bureaux) associations and think tanks representing more than 2,000 companies and over 30,000 individual members. It was set up in 1997 to help marketers make the most of the new digital media at their disposal. Along with its sister organisations in North and South America, Asia and the Far East, the IAB coordinates research, defines best practice and acts as the main political body, lobbying on behalf of interactive marketers. &copy; Copyright 2007 by Finfacts.com Online advertising in UK, the Netherlands and Denmark exceeds 10% of total annual advertising spend but lags at 3.5% in Ireland Eurozone unemployment fell to 7.1% in April - the lowest since records began in 1993 Growth of UK manufacturing sector maintained in May; Factory gate prices rose at joint-sharpest rate in series history Eurozone and EU27 GDP up by 0.6%; +3.0% and +3.2% respectively compared to Q1 2006 Eurozone PMI signals further robust manufacturing expansion despite slipping to 15-month low; Growth of employment steadies at six-and-a-half year high French consumer confidence rises to record high as unemployment falls to 24-year low Eurozone Consumer Confidence rose in May; Business Climate Indicator fell slightly Eurozone inflation steady at 1.9% in May Airbus receives orders for 150 aircraft Eurozone retail sales fell in May but decline may be weather related European Central Bank says annual growth rate of money/credit in the Eurozone fell in April; Interest rate hikes still in frame Royal Bank of Scotland led consortium makes bid for Dutch financial services group ABN Amro German consumer confidence rises to five month high EU27 FDI flows with the rest of the world up by 38% in 2006; Inflows to Ireland from outside EU27 only 300m Ryanair opens 20th European base in Bristol - 13 new routes and $140m investment German business confidence remained close to record level in May EU Court of Justice supports trade unions on cheap imported labour New industrial orders up by 2.7% in Eurozone in March; up by 16.4% in year Mobile roaming charges to fall dramatically across Europe Markets bet on two further interest rate hikes in 2007 as European Central Bank policy makers warn that inflationary pressures persist

Posted Jun 4, 2007 9:20 am PT April's figures showed the Wii was outselling the PlayStation 3 4-to-1 in Japan, and last month the gap widened even further, with the cheaper Nintendo console now 5-to-1 ahead, reports Bloomberg, quoting figures from publisher Enterbrain Inc, revealed that 251,794 Wiis had been sold in Japan in May, five times as many units as the PS3. Microsoft's Xbox 360 lagged even further behind, with 11,082 units changing hands last month. Exact figures were not given for PS3 sales, but they are likely to be in the region of 50,000. The story was much the same in the battle of the handhelds, with the Nintendo DS having sold 620,670 to the PlayStation Portable's 123,673 during May. &laquo; Back to Today's News to post a comment on this story! Does anyone else here find the title full of bias, everyone knows the Wii's doing well sales-wise, but comparing to Sony when MS is doing even worse in Japan is really sad.

After the first couple of weeks the wii got boring, it gets real repetitive and the motion is the same for a lot of games i think the 360 and PS3 will get better than the wii in a year or two once they get some better stuff and wii gets old cause there is only so many motions you could do, its gonna get boring, plus you cant have any FPS or fast paced games on the wii, only party games. Trust me the wii will end up losing Posted Jun 4, 2007 2:13 pm PT to rate this comment HALOISTHEBEST26 Posted Jun 4, 2007 2:13 pm PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) Xbox 360 all the WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

What I do find funny though, and understandable, is the fact that they just say out selling the PS3, last I heard, the 360 as well wasn't moving units in Japan either. But, it's good to flame on Sony, gets the hits for the article I suppose.

I love how you mention Halo as a dying breed of FPS but then champion Resistance as a great PS3 launch title.

There isn't a single game for the Wii that I've enjoyed playing. Something is wrong, and should be fixed if Nintendo wants me to keep this thing. Posted Jun 4, 2007 2:05 pm PT to rate this comment Sandro909 Posted Jun 4, 2007 2:05 pm PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) It is "mainly" the price that is holding back people from buying a ps3. Posted Jun 4, 2007 2:05 pm PT to rate this comment gamenux Posted Jun 4, 2007 2:05 pm PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) The Wii is a great console, don't get me wrong, but I'm thinking that hardcore gamers are much more prone to own a 360 or PS3. The Wii is really for more casual audiences at this point in time, seeing as a lot of the more AAA titles have yet to arrive. An expanding casual gaming audience is most likely responsible for the remarkable Wii sales. That's good for the industry overall, though, I suppose.

The Wii was never intended to have the best graphics. Chastising it for not having the best graphics is like disliking a car because it isn't a truck. ...is admittedly bad on the Wii, but as has been seen in commercials, I think it's fairly clear that Nintendo's idea of "multiplayer" is people getting together for a good time in real life, not playing games alone over the internet. ...are not exactly the primary reason I buy a game console. I have a PS2 that can play DVDs. That's really all I need. "Xbox 360 - plenty of AAA games out there" "PS3 - tilt sensitive controls and hot list of games due." Rather subjective evaluations. I looked at both of the lists of games available for the 360 and the PS3. Neither of them contained that many games that piqued my interest. "Remakes of nintendo games with glorified controls" That is provably false. The fact that quite a few Nintendo games use familiar characters does not make them "remakes". A remake is where you have the exact same game, only with better graphics. Meanwhile, Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and pretty well 99% of the games on the Wii are brand new games that have not been seen before. If we're going to laugh at Nintendo for making sequels for some games, can we at least not do the same thing for GTA IV or Halo 3? "This is what I define as next gen, and as you can see the Wii doesnt really fit in." I've bolded the part that really matters. It's your opinion and you're welcome to it. Just don't act as if it's impossible for anyone else to arrive at a different conclusion.

The fact that remains is that i know soo many ppl omly downloading old games or playing just wii sports. It is the in thing for now.... i have one, but it has been weeks since i have even turned it on. When i see a mario galaxies or metroid if i'm not too busy with halo 3, mass effect, GTA IV or one of the many ex PS3 exlusives on my 360, i might turn it on again. For now it just collects dust. Nintendo the time is now to bring the onslaught of 1st party tiltes. It is quite clear no one else knows how to make a game for yor tiny console. Do not be arogant.... you have new users and have regained some of the old ones back.

Since the x360 came out, all of the PS3 fanboys were yelling the SAME thing : Xbox will fail because it cannot seem to make its way into the Asian market. Well guess what my friends! That SAME argument can now be said about the PS3!! The PS3 CANT EVEN compete with the Wii in its OWN market! AT LEAST the x360 dominates the Americas!! Surely some fan boy is gonna have some kind of response to this, justifying and rationalizing whats going on. But the evidence is clear. Last month, Wii was outselling the PS3 4 to 1. NOW its 5 to 1. The Verdict? No one even in JAPAN wants a PS3.

I can'tell that I have more than twelve game, and even if some are not GREAT, they are all fun to play. And with friends you just can't get that kind of fun even on PS2. Don't misunderstand me, I play more on PS2 than Wii right now, way more. But the PS2 is mostly for single player game... At least for me. ps: please forgive my bad english.

Here's hoping that Sony can produce that monster of a machine for cheap, lowering the cost of the PS3 which will inevitiably drive sales through the roof. 200 million PS2's are in homes people......I know sony can pull out of this.

The highest ammount of consoles sold in one region is 32 million here in america and the 360 won't come close to 30 million sold just in America. the Xbox is doomed if it can't sell in Japan. Even MS said it "it's very important to sell well in Japan" Seems the 360 is the first "Niche" console. Your statement has FANBOY written all over it. The 360 sells in Europe, Australia, Central and South America. MS said it would be important to sell well in Japan but not that they would be "doomed". If that were the case then the PS3 will be "doomed".

That's just a matter of choice, and i chose the PS3, but that does not say the PS3 is better. i belive both are excelent, but it depends on you. i chose the PS3 because i thought that i could have many things on one system. those who do not want to pay more $200 for the PS3 and want just a system to play games, buy a 360. i just think the way people talk about the PS3(and some of them have not even played it) is an absurd. i mean, PS3 is just as good the 360. however, people keep saying the PS3 is not good, that it does not have good games. that's a lie. the 360 has great games, but the PS3 has great games too and will have much more from september on. i dare to say that the PS3 is seen as a bad system (that it is not worth your money and things like that) because of the advertising that Gamespot, IGN and others do about the PS3. you see, the PS3 is outselling the 360 in Japan five-to-one! that's just a matter of choice, as i said before> Japanese prefer PS3/Wii, and americans prefer 360.

There making all these shooters to tide gamers over till Halo but once halo releases why would anyone buy more shooters? Sadly there even more shooters scheduled after Halo so it's just to much. I have a PC and if there one gen i'm getting tired it's Shooters. the last thing i want for a console is more of them when i have 10 AAA shooters on my PC already that are still fun an argubaly better.

You're falling into the trap of assuming that your own opinions about what is important in video games are universal truths. I personally still play NES and SNES games when the urge hits me. Why? Because I enjoy games that are fun to play and honestly don't really care what the graphics are like as long as they don't detract from the entertainment factor. The game with the best graphics will inevitably make for the best screenshots before the game itself is released, but once people start playing it, the graphics in a game really only play a minor role, and even then it's mostly only as far as how much the graphics contribute to the overall gameplay. I don't think people playing games realize how little time they actually spend watching the graphics themselves. Video games are not movies.

I bought the system out of curiosity and sold it about 5 weeks later. I was bored with anything that was not Wii Sports. Give it about a couple of PS3 price drops and some more decent software on Sony's system and you will definately see that 5:1 ratio get closer. I am no fanboy or anything but I think the Wii as a quality gaming system is one of the biggest video game shams ever I couldn't agree more. The Wii is a Gamecube with a motion senor controller, nothing more. Yet somehow Nintendo have managed to re-brand it and sell it for 4 times the price of a Gamcube." If you're only into gaming so that you can point to the screen and impress people with pretty pictures, you have a point. Otherwise guys like you just sound like you have your heads in the sand.

The European Space Agency's Venus Express, in orbit around Venus since April 11, 2006, will be joined for a few hours Wednesday by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Messenger (MErcury Surface Space ENvironment GEochemistry and Ranging mission) spacecraft en route to Mercury. Scientists said the direct, two-point measurements of some planetary phenomena have great potential to offer new science. At the time of closest approach, Messenger will be flying over Venus at an altitude of approximately 209 miles. At the same time, Venus Express will be behind Venus but looking at the same regions observed by Messenger before and after the fly-by. That will allow scientists to compare data obtained by the two spacecraft within only a short difference in time. Of particular interest will be observations of Venus' cloud deck, plasma environment, atmosphere and its oxygen airglow and surface. Venus Express, ESA's first mission to Venus, was launched Nov. 9, 2005. Messenger was launched Aug. 3, 2004, and is expected to reach Mercury in 2011. &copy; Copyright 2007 United Press International, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Open Source Pulls in $1.8 Billion Adoption of standalone open source software is accelerating, say researchers. Part 1 of a special five-part series. Monday, June 04, 2007 8:00 AM PDT A new IDC study has said that the growth in adoption of stand-alone open source software is accelerating and that the total market will be worth US$5.8 billion in 2011. The market reached $1.8 billion in 2006, and will grow 26 percent annually for the next four years, the firm predicted. The study is a relatively unusual effort to treat the sprawling, quick-changing open source software market as a serious business, and indicates the growing business acceptance of open source software. IDC found that the open source market is in a significant stage of growth, as previous barriers to adoption fall away. This is particularly true in the business world, where companies are waking up to the fact that open source opens up more choices and gives them something to use as a bargaining chip with proprietary software vendors. Companies are also becoming more comfortable with subscription revenue as a business model, something common among open source companies, while larger enterprises are also getting on board. Financial backing from venture capitalists is helping boost growth, IDC said. Software distribution is growing, but revenues will take longer to follow suit, researchers found. That's partly because much open source software is free, while other products use a subscription revenue model rather than getting users to pay a lump sum up front. / 1000 max characters Brits are Busiest Surfers Microsoft Accused of Endangering Users Mobile Devices Set Record Gartner Cuts Chips Forecast Xandros Joins Novell in Licensing Microsoft IP Linux distributor agrees to licensing deal similar to the one Novell struck with Microsoft last year.

Swedish surfers love web pages When it comes to the number of pages looked at, the Swedes romp home by a considerable margin, with the average user taking in 4,019 pages per month â 51 percent above the European average. The Netherlands and Scandinavian countries have the highest percentage of folks online, with anything from 68 percent to 83 percent online, but when it comes to numbers per country online, Germany takes the crown with an online population of 32.6 million people aged 15 and older. The Germans may have more people online, but us Brits can proudly claim to have most active online population, boasting the highest average number of daily visitors (21.8 million), the highest usage days per month (21 per user), and the highest average time spent per month per user (34.4 hours). We dread to think how many lost office hours are included in that impressive tally. Overall, European users average 16.5 usage days per month, with Russian surfers coming bottom of the access pile, mustering up just 11.4 average usage days. Other countries falling behind the European average are Austria (12.0), Italy (12.9), Ireland (13.0), Portugal (13.4), Norway (14.7), Denmark (14.7), Switzerland (15.1), Belgium (15.5) and Finland (16.4). Not surprisingly, Google was found to be the most popular property in 13 of the 16 countries, followed by Microsoft in most countries. Yahoo! trailed behind in third place across Europe, although it managed to bag the number one slot in Ireland, Italy and Spain.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/13-0&fd=R&url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/fun.games/06/04/bullet.witch/&cid=1116956272&ei=h4BkRvOzHJGoqwPdn5maBg Review: 'Bullet Witch' casts a weak spell - CNN.com Review: 'Bullet Witch' casts a weak spell What's a video gamer to do while waiting for blockbuster titles such as "Madden NFL 08" (August 14), "Halo 3" (September 25) and "Grand Theft Auto IV" (October 16)? The answer is to rent some games for the weekend, such as Atari's "Bullet Witch," an average sci-fi shooter for the Microsoft Xbox 360. This third-person shooter takes place in the year 2013, after our planet has suffered fatalities in the billions because of natural disasters, war and infectious diseases. As if this weren't enough, an inter-dimensional portal opened up, allowing demons to seep through and attack those few people remaining. This is where you come in. You play as Alicia Claus, a beautiful witch who is as powerful with her magic spells as she is deft with a trigger finger. She wields a huge "gun-rod," a kind of broom-shaped weapon that can be upgraded over time. But gun battles with hoards of demons get tiring after a while. For one, while some might run for cover, the not-so-bright creatures basically stand there and let you shoot them down one by one. Another issue is that the action sequences repeat each other often, which works something like this: fight baddies, move ahead and watch a short story sequence, then fight more baddies and move ahead toward the end of the level. You start with the gun-rod as a machine gun, but in time it can be switched to a shotgun, sniper rifle and Gatling gun. Magic spells, however, produce a more exhilarating effect than the predictable gunplay. Pressing the left or right shoulder button brings up a magic wheel, whereby you can spin and select what kind of magic spell to invoke -- if you've earned enough skill points to unlock it. Highlights include "Willpower," which creates a shock wave that sends nearby objects hurling toward enemies, and "Lightning," where Alicia summons a bolt that kills the enemy instantly. Visually speaking, the effects of these spells (and others, including summoning a meteor shower) are quite gratifying. It's too bad the huge and detailed environments in "Bullet Witch," such as accurately modeled suburban neighborhoods, are as linear as they are. That is, you're given the impression you can go anywhere and do anything -- as in "Grand Theft Auto" -- but you soon realize you're on a short leash and must follow a specific path. Another problem with the game is that it can be cumbersome to control Alicia's movement with the Xbox 360's left analog stick while moving the camera with the right analog stick. It's like having to play actor and director at the same time, which might work for some games (usually when the camera is somewhat automated, but lets you swivel it around for a better view) but not when both are continuously mandatory, as in "Bullet Witch." This single-player adventure has its strengths -- namely, big and attractive outdoor environments and impressive spell casting effects -- but dumb artificial intelligence, repetitive gun battles and awkward controls bring the game down to a C-grade experience. And at only six or seven hours of play, you can easily tackle this single-player shooter in a weekend. But if you need to get your action fix while waiting for this year's more eagerly anticipated video games, you could do worse than "Bullet Witch." Next story in Technology What are E-mail Alerts?

IT and TELCO JOBS Do the new DRM-free tracks have a worm in the Apple? Do the new DRM-free tracks have a worm in the Apple? Saturday, 02 June 2007 iTunes Plus with DRM-free tracks are finally here, but each track, DRM-free or no, contains the name you used to register iTunes to dissuade you from placing your songs on P2P networks. Its official: Steve Jobs to launch iPhone June 29! Internode hikes ADSL prices for power users - UPDATE Why Apple will sell 10 million iPhones in 2008 Do the new DRM-free tracks have a worm in the Apple? Apple&rsquo;s gone partially DRM-free, but a surprising discovery reported online says that your name, your email address and other personal details are embedded into each track that you purchase from iTunes, whether it has DRM to protect it, or not. Following this discovery, the EFF said additional information had been found in iTunes files, possibly amounting to an additional &lsquo;digital watermark&rsquo;, allowing songs uploaded from iTunes to be easily identified. Unfortunately, hackers are already working on ways to strip this information from iTunes&rsquo;s DRM-free EMI songs, as well as &lsquo;spoof&rsquo; the information to make it appear as through from someone else, as surprise and mild outrage spreads that Apple has included this information with DRM-free music downloads. Apple&rsquo;s DRM-free tracks cost a US 30c premium over non-DRM tracks, and offer encoding at a higher quality bitrate &ndash; 256kbps instead of 128kbps, making songs played through an iPod to a large speaker system sound much better than the older 128kbps format. Clearly, users don&rsquo;t like the idea they are being tracked while paying extra for DRM-free(dom), but the chances are that most iTunes buyers will be happy, law-abiding citizens who have no plans to uploaded iTunes music content. Those that do want to upload music from EMI purchased from iTunes have been given fair warning- if you upload songs to P2P networks, chances are EMI and Apple will find out and will come down on you like a ton of bricks. At least, until the hackers release a DRM-free clean up patch to the iTunes files. No-one yet knows how successful the DRM-free experiment will be, or if it will sell more songs to consumers, but so far, Apple&rsquo;s sweet start has, at least for some, turned a little sour.

http://www.technewsworld.com/story/57670.html&cid Technology News: iPhone: iPhone Gets a Due Date Manage Remotely with the HP ProLiant DL360 G5 Server Letters to the Editor ECT News Network Map CRM Buyer Site Map E-Commerce Times Site Map Search ECT News Network June 4, 2007 02:14:32 PM PDT Read Next Article in iPhone iPhone Gets a Due Date Part of the ECT News Network 06/04/07 11:23 AM PT Always careful to orchestrate news of product rollouts on its own terms, Apple this weekend set a specific date on the launch of the iPhone: June 29. The news was conveyed in three television ads that featured lots of iPhone eye candy, with close-up images of the device's Web surfing, video playback and photo browsing capabilities. BlackBerry® Solutions Deliver Results Mobile business users are discovering how to make the most of their time in the field with wireless applications. Create a customized business case in less than five minutes and see what BlackBerry® Solutions can do for your organization. The date for the much-anticipated iPhone launch has been set for June 29. tipped the date Sunday with a trio of new television ads, which are also available for viewing on its Web site. If soon-to-be iPhone owners have been antsy for news of the June release date, there's a good chance they'll start drooling when they see the new ads, which feature close-up views of the iPhone playing high-quality video, surfing the Web, browsing through album covers, family photos, and a seafood restaurant search that shows off results on a handy street map. "The iPhones will be on sale in company-owned resale stores, and they'll be available in Apple retail stores as well as on their online store," John Kampfe, a spokesperson for AT&T, told MacNewsWorld. Apple confirmed the date but declined to comment on details. The iPhone will only be available via AT&T (formerly Cingular) service plans, and as Apple's iPhone video ads note, the use of the iPhone will require a minimum two-year activation plan. Apple may launch the iPhone with a special event rather than during regular events at which it has kicked off new products in the past, such as its Worldwide Developers Conference, going on next week in San Francisco. Will Apple and AT&T launch some pre-Fourth of July weekend fireworks? "We're not disclosing any other plans at this point beyond what we've said already," Kampfe noted. However, Apple already milked a great deal of hype when it unveiled the iPhone back in January at Macworld. A second event might be overkill. "To be honest, I don't think they need to do a whole lot to drive additional attention. There's a lot of hunger around this already," Charles Golvin, a principal analyst with Apple and AT&T may hold a launch event at the Apple Store in New York to help drive mass media coverage, Golvin noted. They may also let the iPhone go on sale at midnight the night before, he speculated. "I still see two waves of uptake, and the first is the Apple fan boys, the people who are devoted to all things Apple ... and there are plenty of them," Golvin explained. These Apple customers have been paying careful attention to their cellular service contracts and have been making sure they are off of competitors' contracts in advance of the iPhone launch. "The more interesting piece will be the second wave, those who are very interested, who maybe already have a BlackJack or Motorola Q -- or something in the same space that's more consumer-friendly than a BlackBerry," Golvin noted. "We'll see if they're still willing pay the premium [for an iPhone]." The iPhone will initially come in two versions -- a 4 GB model for US$499 and an 8 GB model for $599. The steep price tag could put quite a heavy burden on sales ; however, when adding the price of a new iPod to that of a cell phone, the total could be close enough to justify the expense to some consumers. After the initial wave of sales to Apple aficionados, the price may well hold strong. "There's so much attention paid on the price point, but if you go back to the initial price of the Motorola Razr, when also had an exclusive on it, it was $499, so this is not the first phone to be priced at this level," Golvin explained. "And they were able to hold that price point for quite a while." Next Article in iPhone: You've Got to Hide Your iPhone Away More by Chris Maxcer ListManager software is robust, scalable, integrated.

It has done a number on the PS3 thus far. In May it seems that more of the same is happening in Japan as the hardware sales numbers have shown that the Nintendi Wii sales continued to pull Nintendo way ahead of Sony and their PS3. The sales ratio last month was about 5 Nintendo Wii consoles sold for every 1 PlayStation 3 console sold in Japan last month. Nintendo sold though about 252,000 Wii consoles in May in Japan. This is a five to one ratio compared to the PS3 sales in Japan. The PS3 is the most powerful console and still has major Japanese support from companies such as Square Enix, Konami, more specifically Hideo Kojima, as well as other companies such as Polyphony Digital (Gran Turismo) and Naughty Dog (Jak and Daxter.) The lead continues in the handheld department as well with the DS selling 620,670 units in May compared to 123,673 PSPs sold. Nintendos lead keeps growing and at this pace in a few months it could be tough for Sony to catch up fully. Discuss this article in our or login to your account to post a comment.

And those who wield the rights to mighty game franchises are hoping to reel in as much cash as possible. Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter that Take-Two may opt to push back the launch of Grand Theft Auto IV in a move to boost its financial results for 2008. For the moment, GTA IV is set to arrive on October 16, which is a few weeks before the end of the fiscal year. Pachter said, "We believe that it is possible that the company will choose to 'throw in the towel' on financial year 07 by shifting the release date for Grand Theft Auto IV by a few weeks, increasing the losses incurred this year and improving the companys prospects for financial year 08." He also mentioned that a two week delay should establish a "reasonable gap" between the release of GTA IV and Halo 3, which "would actually help sales of both games."

These setbacks and other distractions ranged from the whole Lisa Nowak affair in February, to getting hit by a freak hailstorm in March that damaged a fuel tank. A few months later, with just six weeks left until the new June launch date, a seventh astronaut, Clayton Anderson, was added to Atlantisâ crew â a jarring adjustment that meant working overtime to get Anderson on track with his duties during the mission. There also was a murder-suicide at Houstonâs Johnson Space Center and the derailment of a train carrying rocket booster segments for future shuttle flights. Neither event directly involved Atlantisâ mission but reinforced a feeling that, so far, this isnât NASAâs best year. It would seem that once this thing gets off the ground, everyone at NASA will be a little less stressed, no?

Microsoft Trounces Pro-ODF Forces in State Battles By Eric Lai and Gregg Keizer &mdash; In a resounding victory for Microsoft, bills seeking to mandate the use of open document formats by government agencies have been defeated in five states, and only a much-watered-down version of such legislation was signed into law in a sixth state. The proposed bills would have required state agencies to use freely available and interoperable file formats, such as the OpenDocument Format (ODF) for Office Applications, instead of Microsoft's proprietary Office formats. The legislation was heavily backed by such as IBM, which uses the file format in its Notes 8 software, and Sun Microsystems, which sells the ODF-compliant StarOffice desktop application suite. But a bill introduced in Connecticut earlier this year met a quick death. And in Florida, Texas and Oregon, would-be laws were all killed off within the past month while being debated in legislative committees, following fierce opposition from Microsoft lobbyists and allies of the software vendor. The most recent defeat occurred last Thursday in California, where a toned-down version of a bill in favor of open formats was declared to be stalled in the state assembly's Committee on Appropriations&#151;even though the bill's sponsor, Mark Leno, a Democratic assemblyman for San Francisco, chairs the committee. A spokesman for Leno declined to comment on the fate of the bill, which was . But Microsoft also fought the proposal in California ( The only recent victory for advocates of open formats was a Pyrrhic one. In Minnesota, a bill that would require state agencies to begin using an open, XML-based format was eventually transformed into a call for the state's IT department to study the issue. That language was attached to another bill that has been signed by Gov. Tim Pawlenty, according to Don Betzold, a Democratic state senator who was the original sponsor of the open-formats proposal. Betzold said he got interested in the topic of ensuring long-term access to state documents after observing the difficulty of accessing old data stored in mainframes and on floppy disks. But during the ensuing policy debate, Betzold and other politicians quickly felt overwhelmed by the technical jargon presented by each side. "I wouldn't know an open document format if it bit me on the butt," he said. "We're public policy experts. [Deciding technical standards] is not our job." Microsoft didn't respond to requests for comment about the legislative results in the various states. But one of its close allies said they showed the unpopularity of technical mandates.

(not case-sensitive) A flight simulator at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex; union strike; and results from the DEPTHX robotic vehicle Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer (DEPTHX) has reached the bottom of the world's deepest sinkhole.Â  According to researchers involved with the project, the robotic vehicle was able to explore 318 meters below the surface , a depth never met.Â  The El Zacaton sinkhole, the world's deepest, does not have any tunnels or underwater connections with other sinkholes in the area. NASA wants the Stone Aerospace robot to search Europa, one of Jupiter's icy moons.Â  The depth and reliability tests in Earth's deepest sinkhole were a crucial step towards a possible trip to Europa. Understanding only a very small number of carefully chosen, highly qualified people get to take a trip on the space shuttle, NASA recently opened a launch simulator for the general public . The $60-million simulator opened up last week at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.Â  The Shuttle Launch Experience takes participants through space -- 27 current and former astronauts helped compile the trip that tourists get to experience.Â  Before entering the simulation, participants listen to a videotaped demonstration regarding space and NASA space shuttle technology. The International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers, a union that represents 570 workers at the Kennedy Space Center, voted to strike Saturday , just six days before the scheduled launch of shuttle Atlantis. The union rejected an offer by the United Space Alliance over the possible renewal of the collective bargaining agreement. According to union spokespeople, workers could strike as early as June 10, a mere two days after the scheduled Atlantis launch. Even with such a close proximity to the NASA launch, the strike would likely not affect the next shuttle launch. United Space Alliance hopes an agreement can be reached before June 10. According to researchers involved with the project, the robotic vehicle was able to explore 318 meters below the surface, a depth never met. Something is definitely wrong here.... I mean, even the Titanic is over 10 times deeper and it's been explored... He is right. The titanic is 12,536 feet under the ocean and this is only 1043.31 feet. For those who can't do meters. I believe they are refering to the sink hole... It is the first vehicle to reach that depth - in that sink hole. Maybe they mean a depth never met in terms of going down a sinkhole? That or they dropped a zero somewhere. It definitely needs clarification. Its a depth never reached in a sinkhole. I still can't figure out what the challenge behind it is. What is so different with a sinkhole that things that have gone down miles couldn't do here. It's hard to get excited about nothing. Therefore, you must use colorful, often misleading language to get the attention of the reader. I watched a few specials on sinkholes and the underwater aquifer systems and whatnot here in Florida (and I slept at a Holiday Inn!), and it's probably impressive because sink holes go straight down only so far. Then they go horizontal -- some times for tens of miles, with whole systems possibly hundreds of miles in length. I havent read the article but it's possible that little robot had to travel a very impressive distance to get that depth relative to the surface. If they're going to strike.. .. then now is the time to do it! Milk what little they can from their last few years of employment before NASA has to sack them, god knows for maybe half a decade or longer, after the termination of Shuttle operations until the resumption of manned travel with Ares. And while they're on strike it'd also be a good idea for them to call all their peers across the nation to line up a new job, which they should take before the actual final hammer falls, at which point they'd be competing with all sorts of other laid-off employees. Yep. Good move on their part. I'm generally opposed to unions & strikes, but I wish them luck, the government's just going to screw them in a few years anyway. They've learned well from their president; pre-emptive action! :) âAnd I don't know why [Apple is] acting like itâs superior. I don't even get it.

Google Offers Book Search to Publishers Controversial book search engine can be co-branded and embedded on publishers&#039; sites. Part 1 of a special five-part series. Juan Carlos Perez, IDG News Service Sunday, June 03, 2007 10:00 AM PDT Google is making its controversial engine available to publishers interested in putting it on their Web sites. This is the first time Google's Book Search service has been available outside of its main site in the Google.com domain. This co-branded search program benefits Google because the search engine will now be available more broadly. Meanwhile, publishers benefit by offering an additional search service to their Web site visitors. Publishers can tailor the index of their search engine so that only books published by them show up in the query results, Google said Friday. As in the main site, these result pages give users the option to link to online shops that sell the listed books. Interestingly, one of the publishers that put Book Search on its Web site is The McGraw-Hill Companies. Along with other major publishers, McGraw-Hill is for copyright infringement over Google's ongoing project to scan millions of copyright books without permission. Although McGraw-Hill's position may seem at first contradictory, it stems from the fact that Google's Book Search service has two main pieces. One focuses on securing formal partnerships with publishers, obtaining their permission to scan books and giving them control over how much of those books can be displayed by Google for free. McGraw-Hill is one of about 10,000 publishers that participate in this partner program with Google that have collectively made available about 1 million titles for scanning so far, said Tom Turvey, director of Google Book Search partnerships. About 50 publishers have embedded Book Search in their sites already, and many more are in line to do so, Turvey said. McGraw-Hill didn't immediately reply to a request for comment. Simultaneously, McGraw-Hill objects to the other portion of the Book Search operation, in which Google partners with major academic libraries to scan large portions of their collections. Those library scanning operations often involve copyright books, which Google is digitally copying without obtaining permission from publishers and authors. / 1000 max characters U.S. Cracks Down on Copyright Wiki Host Adds AnalysisTool Photoshop Plug-in Supports Google Service Apple Codes DRM-Free iTunes With Buyer&#039;s ID Pornographer Indicted for Online Film Distribution Google, Salesforce.com Partnership Predicted Xandros Joins Novell in Licensing Microsoft IP Linux distributor agrees to licensing deal similar to the one Novell struck with Microsoft last year.

NASA / JHU-APL / CIW By By Ker Than The upcoming flyby of a NASA spacecraft over Venus could provide new insights about the cloud-shrouded planet and will serve as a dress rehearsal for its first rendezvous next year with its main target, Mercury. On June 5, Messenger will fly over Venus in a maneuver designed to use the pull of the planet's gravity to slow it down enough that it can slip into the orbit of . During the flyby, Messenger will decelerate from 22.7 to 17.3 miles per second (36.5 to 27.8 km/s). "This change in Messenger's velocity is the largest of the mission," said Messenger mission systems engineer Eric Finnegan, of the Applied Physics Laboratory at John Hopkins University. the Venus on the planet's dayside at more than 30,000 miles per hour (48,000 km/h), pass over the boundary separating day from night, and pass within 200 miles (320 kilometers) of the planet's surface while on its night side. Second pass, with a first for science The upcoming flyby will be Messenger's second pass by Venus. During the first flyby, in October 2006, no scientific observations were made because the planet was at superior conjunction, placing it on the opposite side of the sun from Earth. The closest approach on that flyby was about 1,800 miles (3,000 kilometers) of the planet's surface. "Because of superior conjunction, because we knew we were going into radio blackout, and we knew we had the second flyby coming up in June, we elected not to turn on any of the instruments at the time of that flyby," said the mission's principal investigator, Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The second Venus flyby will mark the first time Messenger's full suite of scientific instruments is turned on simultaneously, allowing scientists to test and calibrate them before turning them onto their main planetary objective next January. "The approach geometry is sufficiently similar to that of Mercury, allowing the seven instrument-package to be turned on and operating collectively in scientific observing mode, just as they will be for Mercury," Finnegan said. Messenger is expected to collect more than 6 gigabytes of data about the Venus system and take more than 600 images during the 73-hour flyby. The information will provide new observations about Venus' atmosphere, cloud structure, space environment and perhaps even its surface.

The will work together to investigate how particles from the sun's solar wind affects and controls the upper layers of Venus's atmosphere. "By coordinating and comparing these observations, we will be able to maximize the science from both missions and potentially learn things that would not be revealed by one set of observations alone," said study team member Ralph McNutt, also of the Applied Physics Laboratory. Launched in August 2004, Messenger (which is actually an extended acronym for anging) is the first mission to visit our solar system's innermost planet in more than 30 years, ever since NASA's Mariner 10 mapped about 45 percent of its surface. Messenger's mission is to map the entire planet, as well as gather information about Mercury's composition and structure, its geologic history, and the makeup of its core and poles.

"They [Apple] aren't the only one to watermark the files," said mordaxus, who pointed out that eMusic does something similar. All iTunes files include the name on the buyer's account and the associated e-mail address -- not just the new DRM-free tunes. But their inclusion on noncopy protected songs is significant, mordaxus said, because some people might be tempted to share bought music on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. "If you're going to put music files up a P2P network, you cannot be paranoid. They are out to get you," said mordaxus.

Wii outgunning PS3 5-to-1 in Japan 06/04/2007 | 10:15:54 AM PST The latest sales figures from Japan indicate that Nintendo hardware outsold competing Sony hardware at a rate of 5-to-1 in the month of May, thus stretching the already widened sales gap between the Wii and PS3. Five-to-one baby, one in five. No one here gets out alive... report reveals that the the sales gap between the PS3 and the Wii widened to its greatest comparative ratio last month. According to sales figures released by Japan's Enterbrain Inc., Nintendo sold 251,794 Wii units in the month of May, leading the Wii to outsell the PS3 at a rate of 5-to-1. The report does not indicate the exact number of PS3 units sold during that same period. The figures do, however, state that the handheld race between Sony and Nintendo hardware has also resulted in a similar ratio. According to Enterbrain's data, the Nintendo DS sold 620,670 units in May while the PSP sold 123,673 units in the same period, creating another sales gap of more than 5-to-1. Meanwhile, despite the buzz surrounding the beta and the eagerly-awaited release of , Microsoft has still been unable to make a dent in the Japanese market, managing to sell only 11,082 Xbox 360 units last month. Have a Wii question? I don't need to tell you the first and more obvious reason for this sales gap, which is the complete and utter lack of software for the PS3. (The Wii, of course, has a nearly similar drought, although the appearance of any Zelda title sometimes seems to make the gaming masses forget that). The other reason is the fact that Nintendo's hardware production has been vastly improved since April, resulting in even higher sales. These figures will only look worse for Sony in the next few months if they don't get something worthwhile out the door pronto. News: Nintendo getting WLAN routers for the Wii?

According to , a man uploaded the first four episodes of the current season of Fox&#8217;s ever popular â24â series and is now facing up to three years in prison. Fox is nearly ecstatic over the work the FBI put into this and is lavishing the agency with praise. The FBI claim that Chicago resident, Jorge Romero uploaded four episodes of â24â back in January to a video sharing site and then proceeded to post links to the uploaded episodes on several other sites. But Romero didn&#8217;t even perform the actual conversion of the videos, he download them from âanother sourceâ and then uploaded them. A rather humorless FBI agent had the following to say, âRomero is charged in the criminal complaint with uploading copyrighted material to a publicly accessible computer network knowing the work was intended for commercial distribution.â The facts are simple, uploading copyrighted material to video sharing sites is illegal though it seems to work well for a certain style which has brought some new DVD releases to the US, but if it&#8217;s made in the US, don&#8217;t upload it to a website. It&#8217;s illegal and it will always be illegal. It remains debatable if this actually harms sales figures. I don&#8217;t know if Mr. Romero knew this was illegal or not and frankly I don&#8217;t care, I have no sympothy for him, ignorance of the law is no excuse. I say, throw the book at him. I don&#8217;t care much for people who share shows or movies, music is a gray area for me. Most people get caught by sharing, not downloading.

Second Life is a three-dimensional, online game produced by San Francisco-based Linden Lab in which participants create a virtual world, buy and sell land and products and interact in all the usual ways. Now religion has a growing presence there too, users say, and religious diversity and participation have skyrocketed since June 2006, when basic membership to Second Life became free. And just like in real-life churches, mosques and synagogues, there is diversity, debate, schism and yes, more than a few holier-than-thou types. With some real-life churches taking notice, it&rsquo;s not just for computer geeks, either. It all starts when users create an online 3-D persona, known as an avatar, taken from the Sanskrit word for a Hindu deity. The game&rsquo;s 3.7 million users control their 6.5 million avatars with their keyboards and communicate with each other via instant message. Noreen Herzfeld, professor of theology and computer science at Saint John&rsquo;s University in Collegeville, Minn., says Second Life reflects what she calls the &ldquo;external face&rdquo; of religion &mdash; community, identity, codes and creeds, ritual and practice. Beth Brown, a 33-year-old Orthodox Jewish artist from Dallas, says she didn&rsquo;t intend to start a community when she built the first synagogue, Second Life Synagogue-Temple Beit Israel, in September. Within an hour of its creation, two avatars were there, and now the virtual synagogue has more than 200 members. For some people, Second Life is their only chance to participate in religious rituals. Recently, Brown started lighting virtual Shabbat candles on Friday nights. Her mother, who lives in New York, attends online. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t light Shabbat candles anywhere with my mother but Second Life,&rdquo; she said. Other faiths have found online expression there also. Yunus Yakoub Islam, who believes he&rsquo;s the only Muslim living in his village in England, uses Second Life to interact with more than 200 members of the game&rsquo;s Islamic Society. Another user, Trey Mu, co-founded Soli Deo Gloria, a Christian fellowship group which has weekly Bible studies and prayer sessions. Second Life enables Christians from around the world to gather at any time of day. In addition, the anonymity allows people to discuss spiritual problems that might not as easily happen in real life, Mu said. Pray away the storms The Diocese of Baton Rouge observed the second annual Day of Prayer and Fasting for Protection During the Hurricane Season with a noon Mass Friday at St. Joseph Cathedral. Bishop Robert W. Muench presided. Camp Quest is the antithesis of church camp.

The fly-by will give researchers the rare opportunity to pair with a European space agency probe studying Venus. "This is the first time that we are able to take observations from two different vantage points," said Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, the principal investigator for the Messenger program. If successful, Messenger, launched in August 2004, will be the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury, arriving in 2011. It also will be the first to visit the planet since Mariner 10 zoomed by three times in the mid-1970s. During Messenger&#039;s first pass by Venus in October, the planet was on the opposite side of the sun, putting it out of radio contact for two weeks. The spacecraft did not pass as close to the planet, so researchers decided against turning on the probe&#039;s instruments, Solomon said. Huge setback to Bush&#x27;s military tribunals at Guant&#xE1;namo Efficient adoption system attracts American couples to Ethiopia JFK plot was short on means and smarts The spacecraft cannot fly straight to Mercury because it is not carrying enough fuel, so it is flying once past Earth, twice past Venus and three times past Mercury for gravity assists before slowing enough to slip into orbit around the small, hot planet. While planets are often used to give probes gravity boosts to speed their travel, Messenger is using Venus to slow down and help guide it into orbit around Mercury, said Andy Calloway, Messenger mission operations manager at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Messenger is the seventh in NASA&#039;s Discovery program of lower-cost, scientifically focused space missions. The Applied Physics Laboratory, which built and operates the probe, manages the mission for NASA. The Venus flyby begins a "veritable inner-planetary roller coaster" ride over the next 18 months as it homes in on its final destination, said Eric Finnegan, Messenger mission systems engineer at the Applied Physics Laboratory. Messenger will pass 209 miles (336.3 kilometers) above the surface of Venus, using the planet to decelerate from 22.7 miles (36.5 kilometers) to 17.3 miles (27.8 kilometers) per second, putting the probe on target to pass Mercury for the first time in January. The encounter with Venus will also provides an opportunity for researchers to team with the European Space Agency&#039;s Venus Express mission to observe the planet second-closest to the sun. Messenger and the European Space Agency&#039;s Venus Express spacecraft will make joint measurements, for example, of how solar wind affects the planet&#039;s atmosphere. Hakan Svedhem, a Venus Express project scientist with the European Space Agency, said astronomers on Earth currently have an excellent view of Venus, and many will be watching the planet as the two probes take measurements. "So, we will get lots of data," Svedhem said. The flyby "provides an excellent opportunity, really, to study Venus from two points close to Venus and also from many points on Earth."

Angelina Jolie tells Marie Claire that her littlest munchkin is &#8220;trying to eat everything in her path.&#8221; She has a rival for the snack closet in older sister Zahara, 2, who &#8220;eats and eats,&#8221; a source tells Us Weekly. &#8220;Zahara&#8217;s a smartass,&#8221; Angelina tells Marie Claire. &#8220;The other day, she said to me, &#8216;I need a cookie.&#8217; I said, &#8216;You need a cookie? You don&#8217;t need a cookie!&#8217; So she says, &#8216;Daddy&#8217;s going to cry.&#8217; I ask, &#8216;Why is Daddy going to cry?&#8217; Z answers, &#8216;Daddy wants me to have the cookie!&#8217;&#8221; Mommy, however, appears to have cut cookies from her diet altogether. Never one to exaggerate anything, the National Enquirer pins the 5&#8242;7&#8243; actress&#8217;s weight at 100 pounds. Angelina&#8217;s chatty bro, James Haven, told Closer magazine that Angelina&#8217;s humanitarian work has ruined her appetite. &#8220;Angelina&#8217;s life changed after she visited Ethiopia,&#8221; James says. &#8220;Whenever she&#8217;s there, there&#8217;s often no food for her and she goes without.

U.S. Rep. William Jefferson Indicted Posted by admin in (Monday June 4, 2007 at Washington - U.S. Rep. William Jefferson was indicted Monday on federal charges of racketeering, soliciting bribes and money-laundering. The indictment is being handed up in U.S. District Court in Alexandria. A press conference was being organized for late Monday in Washington to discuss the case. Jefferson is being accused of accepting a $100,000 bribe from a telecommunications businessman. Authorities said they found $90,000 of the cash in a freezer at Jefferson&#8217;s home. In a raid in 2006, over 19.000 pages of documents were seized from his home. Throughout the investigation, Jefferson has maintained his innocent &#8212; despite a businessman and former aid pleading guilty. Jefferson was re-elected last year despite the looming investigation. Boeing 737 Makes Emergency Landing In Oakland Posted by admin in (Monday June 4, 2007 at Oakland - A Southwest Airliner Boeing 737 has now been taken off an Oakland International Airport runway after a landing gear collapsed Sunday. The plane was diverted to Oakland after crew noticed an emergency light indicating a problem with the landing gear. Flight 3050 was traveling to San Diego from Sacramento. During the investigation, the jet sat on the runway for nearly 9 hours. A spokeswoman for Southwest (NYSE: LUV) says the cause of the landing gear failure is not known. None of the 119 passengers were injured. Charges Dropped Against Canadian At Guantanamo Posted by admin in (Monday June 4, 2007 at Toronto - A US military judged dropped terrorism charges against a young Canadian imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a Pentagon spokesman said Monday. Omar Khadr, 20, had been accused of murder, attempted murder and supporting al-Qaeda. At the time of his capture, he was 15 years old. Prosecutors would likely appeal the decision, the spokesman said. Military Recruitment Up In Canada Posted by admin in (Monday June 4, 2007 at Toronto - Military hopefuls are lining up at their neighborhood recruitment outlet in droves since Canada entered the Afghan mission. The head of Canada&#8217;s defense, General Rick Hillier said at a Federation of Canadian municipalities conference over the weekend that applications have already hit above the 12,000 mark this spring - well above the established targets. He also said the recruitment process has been substantially streamlined too, getting some recruits into uniforms in just five days. As a result, some 35,000 people have joined the military in the last year, up from 25,000 from the previous year. But as far as the mission is concerned, he was firm to say the mission to Afghanistan was only temporary but could have great potential in the future. &#8220;The best estimate is that 55 percent of the population is less than 14 years of age. Can you imagine the potential if you can keep those kids alive and educate them and give them some hope for the future?&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Afghan people don&#8217;t want a handout &#8212; they just want help in the short term and they want to rebuild their own country.&#8221; China Reveals New Climate Plan Posted by admin in (Monday June 4, 2007 at Bejing - China uses a lot of energy and its economy has been growing very quickly, which means that their carbon output has also been increasing. China has already taken some steps towards greening their economy and now they will continue that trend. Chinaâs climate change strategy looks like a good step. The country stressed that economic development comes first with a focus on sustainability. They also maintained their stance that developed nations need to take more action on climate change because most of it is their fault. I totally agree with China on this last point. But it also stressed that the countryâs first priority remained âsustainable development and poverty eradicationâ. âChina is a developing country. Although we do not have the obligation to cut emissions, it does not mean we do not want to shoulder our share of responsibilities,â Ma Kai, chairman of Chinaâs National Development and Reform Commission, said. Fellow Prisoners Not Happy With Paris Hilton Posted by admin in (Monday June 4, 2007 at Los Angeles - Paris Hilton has angered her fellow prisoners before even arriving in jail. The hotel heiress must hand herself in on June 5 to serve 23 days at California&#8217;s Century Regional Detention Facility for driving with a suspended licence and the inmates are already baying for her blood. Susannah Johnson - who was released on Saturday (02.06.07) after a one-day stay at the jail - said the other prisoners are already angry with Paris because they blame her for the crowded conditions in the 2,200-bed correctional facility. Johnson, 35, told the Sunday Times newspaper: &#8220;The only advice I could give her when she comes is to shut her mouth and do the time.&#8221; The 26-year-old socialite has already booked a make-up artist and chauffeur-driven limousine to take her the 15 miles from her Hollywood home to the jail. &#8216;The Simple Life&#8217; star will stay in the special needs wing of the prison for her own protection and her cellmate - a fellow reckless driving convict - has been handpicked as the person least likely to abuse the experience of sharing a cell with Paris. Islamic Group To Release Video Of Captured American&#8217;s Posted by admin in (Monday June 4, 2007 at Washington - An Islamic militant web site will release video footage of three captured Americans, according to media reports Monday. A banner posted by a prominent jhadist website announced that the al-furqan foundation will soon be releasing a video about &#8220;the clashes and the arrest of three Americans&#8221; in Iraq according to Washington, D.C.-based SITE Institute, an organization that monitors militant Web sites The 10-minute, 41-second, which shows the planning stages and operation, footage following the attack from al-Jazeera television, and images of identification cards of two of the soldiers, Pvt. Byron Wayne Fouty and Spc. Alex Ramon Jimenez. The soldiers disappeared in Iraq in mid-May. Will Tony Soprano get whacked next week? Posted by admin in (Monday June 4, 2007 at New York Boss Phil and Jersey boss Tony stepped up their war, and put a hit on each other. Phil also puts a hit on Syl and Bobby." align="right" />Toronto - With only one episode remaining of The Sopranos, last night the writers left us with a cliffhanger. New York Boss Phil and Jersey boss Tony stepped up their war, and put a hit on each other. Phil also puts a hit on Syl and Bobby. The show started with Syl whacking one of Phil&#8217;s stooges, then Tony talking with his FBI &#8220;friend&#8221; who tells Tony New York has ordered the hits. Tony hires outside help to whack Phil, but the hitman killed the wrong guy and Tony realizes he has to go into hiding. Dr. Melfi, meanwhile, is at a dinner party at her psychiatrist&#8217;s home, and he violates her confidences and mentions at a table full of colleagues that she has a gangster patient. One of the other dinner guests quickly guesses it is Tony Soprano. Melfi, at the urging of Elliot, (her shrink) reads a recent study about sociopaths not being helped by talk therapy. In fact, the article says the sociopath manipulates a shrink and validates his behavior. So after she reads this study, Tony comes to her office and starts talking about his problems, and she is cold, sarcastic and judgmental. She finally tells him therapy is over. Tony is baffled by this abrupt decision, especially since he is in crisis with his son A.J., who is still suffering from depression. I was very disappointed in how the writers handled this segment. After 8 or 9 years of watching Dr. Melfi, this is not the way she would end therapy with a patient, even Tony. However&#8230; The writers of this show are so good, I bet she&#8217;s back next week with a better explanation. It was just too abrupt. Back to the show, though. Tony&#8217;s brother-in-law Bobby is shot and killed while shopping for electric trains. Tony goes home and tells Carm she needs to take the kids and go someplace safe for a few days. When Tony told Carm Bobby was dead, Carm didn&#8217;t even come close to crying, which is out of character for her character. Think back to anytime she heard someone was killed and she was always the first to scream and/or cry. And yet Bobby was her brother-in-law and she had no reaction to being told he was dead. Too strange. While Tony is with Carm, Patsy and Sylvio are shot. Patsy runs away, but Syl is left for dead by the hitman. Syl is in the hospital in a coma and not expected to wake up. Carm and Meadow stop by to see Janice, (where was A.J.?) and Tony and Paulie along with Tony&#8217;s driver and another guy go to a safe house. It ended with Tony lying down in bed with the gun Bobby gave him in the first episode of this season. The camera did a visceral move, as if trying to make you think someone was closing in on Tony. Will Tony get whacked next week? Will Paulie betray Tony? Will the Arabs Tony turned in to the FBI turn out to be terrorists and Tony will save us from them? Will Dr. Melfi be back? Will Syl live? Will A.J. die? Three Earthquakes Rattle New Hampshire Posted by admin in (Monday June 4, 2007 at Portsmouth - Three mild earthquakes struck New Hampshire this past weekend, according to media reports Monday. Two earthquakes struck Saturday night and another Sunday afternoon near the Portsmouth-Exeter area. Although the quakes rattled some buildings, no major damage has been reported. Initially, investigators thought the earthquakes were caused by methane gas explosions. The found areas where gas was escaping from underground near Portsmouth late Saturday evening. Assistant Fire Chief Steven Achilles says that they have ruled out any explosions and believe that the event is linked to seismic activity reported by emergency management officials. Achilles says the methane may be a result of the earthquakes. Angelina Jolie Down To 100lbs U.S. Rep.

http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/06/04/ap3785834.html&cid U.S. Cuts Back Climate Checks From Space - Forbes.com U.S. Cuts Back Climate Checks From Space 06.04.07, 2:19 PM ET The Bush administration is drastically scaling back efforts to measure global warming from space, just as the president tries to convince the world the U.S. is ready to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases. A confidential report to the White House, obtained by The Associated Press, warns that U.S. scientists will soon lose much of their ability to monitor warming from space using a costly and problem-plagued satellite initiative begun more than a decade ago. Because of technology glitches and a near-doubling in the original $6.5 billion cost, the Defense Department has decided to downsize and launch four satellites paired into two orbits, instead of six satellites and three orbits. The satellites were intended to gather weather and climate data, replacing existing satellites as they come to the end of their useful lifetimes beginning in the next couple of years. The reduced system of four satellites will now focus on weather forecasting. Most of the climate instruments needed to collect more precise data over long periods are being eliminated. Instead, the Pentagon and two partners - the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA - will rely on European satellites for most of the climate data. "Unfortunately, the recent loss of climate sensors ... places the overall climate program in serious jeopardy," NOAA and NASA scientists told the White House in the Dec. 11 report obtained by the AP. They said they will face major gaps in data that can be collected only from satellites about ice caps and sheets, surface levels of seas and lakes, sizes of glaciers, surface radiation, water vapor, snow cover and atmospheric carbon dioxide. Rick Piltz, director of Climate Science Watch, a watchdog program of the Washington-based Government Accountability Project, called the situation a crisis. "We're going to start being blinded in our ability to observe the planet," said Piltz, whose group provided the AP with the previously undisclosed report. "It's criminal negligence, and the leaders in the climate science community are ringing the alarm bells on this crisis." Bush has repeatedly cited his administration's record on researching global warming as a response to criticism of his opposition to forced reductions in the greenhouse gases blamed for it. The administration has been spending about $5 billion a year on global warming: $2 billion on climate research and $3 billion on technologies for combatting it. Last week, the president proposed the idea of the 15 largest global-warming polluters - the U.S. is the largest, followed closely by China - meeting to set goals for fixing the problem while leaving it up to each nation just how to do it. The problem will be a major topic at this week's summit of world leaders in Europe. Bush requested $331 million for work on the scaled-back satellite system next year in his fiscal 2008 budget proposal. Congress has yet to act on it. The American Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Academy of Sciences have both cautioned that downsizing the satellite program will result in major gaps in the continuity and quality of the data gathered about the Earth from space. NASA and NOAA agreed in April to restore sensors that will enable the satellites to map ozone. NOAA Administrator Conrad Lautenbacher said that would give scientists a better idea of the content and distribution of atmospheric gases. But seven other separate climate sensors are still being eliminated or substantially downgraded by lower-quality equipment to save money, according to the report to the White House. Most of the satellites, which were scheduled to launch starting next year, have been delayed to between 2013 and 2026. White House science adviser Jack Marburger, for whom the report was intended, acknowledged that climate scientists had been depending greatly on the planned satellites. "We're obviously very concerned about this," he told the AP. "It got in trouble and we couldn't fit all those instruments on it ... leaving us with a number of problems and questions: How do we maintain our momentum in this very important area of science?" NASA spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson told the AP a final version of the "impacts" report was delivered to Marburger on Jan. 8. It was not made public because it is "a pre-decisional document within the administration," she said. NASA and NOAA also are looking for guidance from the National Research Council, which is holding a workshop on the satellites this month. Chet Koblinsky, director of NOAA's climate program office, told the council the satellites "represented the cornerstone of the nation's future space-based climate research program," according to PowerPoint slides obtained by AP. The delays were caused in part because of problems with an infrared sensor that officials either didn't monitor closely enough or didn't bring to the attention of their managers, the Commerce Department's inspector general reported last year. That report also said a contractor on the project was receiving excessive fees. The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, or NPOESS, was first announced in 1994. It was an effort to combine weather-forecasting satellites operated by the Defense Department and NOAA and add climate data-gathering instruments. The plans also involved the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites and the National Space Development Agency of Japan. By 2005, however, the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, found the costs for the U.S. satellites could run to $9.7 billion and were almost a year and a half behind schedule. The Pentagon last year pegged the cost at $11.5 billion and found that it was further behind schedule. Jerry Mahlman, a former scientist at NOAA who is now at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said he and other colleagues warned of problems as far back as 1995. He compared the preparations for the satellites to a "planned train wreck." AP Science Writer Seth Borenstein contributed to this report. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The PlayStation 3 comes with a built-in Blu-ray player, which was partially to blame for the console's delayed ship dates. Open Source a $6B Industry by 2011 Microsoft, Xandros Sign Patent Deal China Puts Moratorium on Internet Cafes RealPlayer Offers One-Click Downloads Study Finds 4 Percent of Links Malicious Sony is slashing the price of its new BDP-300 Blu-ray disc player, which will be available in retail outlets for $499. That's $100 less than originally announced. In fact, just six months since its market debut, Sony has cut the price of its Blu-ray player from $999 to $499, a 50 percent reduction that took traditional DVD players about two years, according to Envisioneering Group data. When DVD players launched about 10 years ago, the price tag was $1,000. A year later, it was still $800. Two years later, retail cost finally dropped to $500. Sony's advantage is that it manufacturers its own blue laser diodes, a key part of the next-gen players. "Sony is passing on some of the manufacturing savings to customers," said Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering Group. "The inability to manufacturer enough diodes was a headache for the PS3 last winter, but now Sony has enough to allow these half-price players." Sony's decision to slash the price might be a response to rival Toshiba's retail rebates. Toshiba uses the competing HD DVD format in its players. The companies are engaged in a bitter battle over which standard will reign supreme in the market. Banking on subsidies to help get its HD DVD players into consumers' living rooms, Toshiba is offering its players for $399. Most retailers offer a $100 rebate, and Amazon offers the machine for $249 through a special deal with Toshiba. But, Doherty said, Toshiba is losing money whereas Sony is making money on its $499 player. "We should see prices stay steady for some time," Doherty said. "I expect there will be some Black Friday discounts and we'll see some fall products from Sony's competitors. We'll see Samsung, LG, and others come close to Sony, but they aren't able to make their own blue laser diodes so they may have higher costs than Sony." Will the PS3 Follow? Some are speculating about whether the PlayStation 3 will see price drops in the coming weeks. However, most analysts don't expect the PS3 to follow the BDP-300's lead. Sony might be waiting to see what does with its Xbox 360. "We think Microsoft is just about break-even with the Xbox and that Sony is at the break-even point this summer," Doherty said. "The PS3 delivers more in its package, though. If you wanted to get an equivalent to the PS3 on the Xbox side it would cost $670 because you would have to add on the HD DVD drive. So until there's some discounting from Microsoft, we don't except Sony to discount." Envisioneering research shows the PlayStation 3 is selling at a faster rate six months after launch than the PlayStation 2 did. While the PlayStation 3 is often compared to Nintendo's Wii, which is half the price, Doherty said the battle between next-generation consoles is clearly between Sony and Microsoft. is the global leader in on-demand CRM, helping 27,100 companies worldwide automate their sales, services, and marketing processes.

Sony BDP-S300, a Cheaper Second Generation Blu-ray Player to be launched Monday, June 4th, 2007 that it will be launching a second generation Blu-ray player this summer for a price of $599, making it even cheaper than the PlayStation 3 (this player costs $100 less than a PS3). This new Sony BDP-S300 player costs half of what the companyâs first Blu-ray player, BDP-S1 cost when it launched just six months ago. When Sony announced the BDP-S300 player in February, it put the price at $599, but has now set a list price at $499. Chris Fawcett, vice president of Sony Electronicsâ home products division , the price cut is due to falling production costs and the growing demand for Blu-ray products. The new player has essentially the same capabilities as the older BDP-S1. If the $499 report is true, it would suggest that Sony has concluded that player prices need to drop more quickly to maintain its advantage over HD DVD. | You can skip to the end and leave a response.

Sales of open source software will grow from $1.8bn last year to $5.8bn in 2011, analyst firm IDC predicts. Matt Lawton, programme director for IDC's Open Source Software Business Models research programme, typified the current market as "immature" and in the "early stages". The projected revenue figure is low when compared to commercial, closed source software. But the analyst believes that revenues alone do not reflect the actual distribution of open source software. Proprietary software typically charges an upfront fee, while open source charges only for support and typically does so on a pay-as-you-go basis. IDC cited culture and comfort levels as the primary drivers behind open source software. The development model has gained credibility because venture capital investors are increasingly backing the software. Companies have become more comfortable with subscription models such as those pioneered by Red Hat.

These commitments provide customers with enhanced interoperability, more effective systems management solutions, and intellectual property assurances. For Xandros, the agreement marks a major milestone in its vision of delivering end-to-end Linux desktop and server solutions as well as WindowsÂ® and Linux cross-platform management and interoperability tools. For Microsoft, the agreement is the latest in a series of collaborations with Linux platform and open source software providers. This list of collaborators includes Novell Inc., JBoss, XenSource Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Zend Technologies Inc. and others. Over the next five years, Microsoft and Xandros will focus on five primary efforts: Systems management interoperability. Xandros and Microsoft believe advances in system management technology can significantly reduce the cost of operating large computer networks running diverse platforms. Xandros will partner with Microsoft to deliver value-added heterogeneous management capabilities that will work with the next generation of MicrosoftÂ® System Center and Xandros Systems Management products, which provide end-to-end service management. Xandros will also join Microsoft and other management vendors in implementing the WS-Management set of protocols in Xandros BridgeWays cross-platform management products and in various systems management standardization efforts. Server interoperability. Xandros will license a broad set of Microsoft server communications protocols. Xandros will develop enhancements to Xandros Server, allowing it to interoperate more smoothly with Windows ServerÂ® in a network setting. Office document compatibility. Xandros and Microsoft share the view that competing office productivity applications should, by design, make it easy for customers to exchange files with one another. To that end, Xandros will join Microsoft and other companies that are building open source translators fostering interoperability between documents stored in Open XML and Open Document Format. Xandros will ship the translators in upcoming releases of its Xandros Desktop offering. Intellectual property assurance. Through the agreement, Microsoft will make available patent covenants for Xandros customers. These covenants will provide customers with confidence that the Xandros technologies they use and deploy in their environments are compliant with Microsoftâs intellectual property. By putting a framework in place to share intellectual property, Xandros and Microsoft can speed the development of interoperable solutions. Microsoft sales and marketing support. The companies are committing to a set of sales and marketing efforts to promote the output of their technical efforts. As part of this effort, Microsoft will now endorse Xandros Server and Desktop as a preferred Linux distribution due to Xandrosâ efforts to establish rich interoperability and deliver IP assurance to its customers. In addition, a specialized team of Microsoft staff will be trained on the value propositions of this collaboration to customers and channel partners. Xandros will also become a member of the Microsoft Interop Vendor Alliance. The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly. Lines and paragraphs break automatically.

Its official: Steve Jobs to launch iPhone June 29! Internode hikes ADSL prices for power users - UPDATE Why Apple will sell 10 million iPhones in 2008 Do the new DRM-free tracks have a worm in the Apple? Your next notebook might not come with a Blu-ray or HD DVD burner, instead having a regular DVD-RW drive instead, but it&rsquo;s likely that Blu-ray and HD DVD burners will not only soon be an option, but a standard feature for road warriors. That&rsquo;s because Toshiba&rsquo;s new slim HD DVD-RW drive, the SD-L912A, is able to read and record HD DVD disks, DVDs and CDs, and is naturally squarely aimed at the mobility market, giving consumers the ability to store 30Gb of data on dual layer HD DVD discs, or transfer their high-definition recordings from TV or HD camcorders to a blank HD DVD disc with enough space to store it. Of course, Blu-ray gives consumers 50Gb of space to play with on a dual-layer disc, but Toshiba&rsquo;s lower expected price will Toshiba hoping this will sway both consumers and manufacturers into adopting their disc standard. Notebooks with Toshiba&rsquo;s HD DVD burners likely won&rsquo;t appear until at least the third quarter, with the fourth quarter more likely, as &ldquo;sample&rdquo; shipments are only due to begin arriving in July. If you&rsquo;re going to be visiting Computex in Taiwan, held in the capital Taipei from June 5 to 9, you can see the drive in question at Toshiba&rsquo;s stand, #B1234. No pricing for the drive was released, nor which customers have already expressed an interest, but as the format war grinds on, so do new drive models that are faster, slimmer, quieter and better than before. Maybe the whole format war ends up really being a good thing, creating such frenzied competition over a plastic disc that prices end up plummeting far faster than they ever did for DVD players. If so, it would be ironic, given Sony and Toshiba&rsquo;s desires to charge a high price to bring back some margin, margin which, with Sony&rsquo;s latest Blu-ray price cut, is rapidly shrinking for consumers at last.

Toshiba will launch the notebook HD disc drive at the Computex trade show in Taipei. Toshiba's SD-L912A can read and rewrite to single and dual-layer HD DVD-RW discs. The Toshiba drive can also read and write to recordable HD-DVD, DVD and CD media, Toshiba said today on the eve of the Computex trade show in the Taiwanese capital. Sample shipments of the drive to PC makers will begin in July. A single-layer HD DVD-RW disc can store up to 20GB of information, which is just over four times the capacity of an equivalent DVD. Toshiba expects the drive will find favour among manufacturers of multimedia laptop computers. Applications like digital television recording or high-definition video editing are pushing up storage demands and leading many users to store data on optical discs or external hard-disk drives. Pricing information was not immediately available. Toshiba plans to offer the drive on an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) basis to PC makers and not as a drive direct to consumers.

http://ps3center.net/story-548.html&cid PS3 Center :: The # 1 Center for Playstation 3 Gamers - Wii Lead Grows Over PS3 In May PS3 Center :: The # 1 Center for Playstation 3 Gamers Devil May Cry 4 Add Your Link Here Wii Lead Grows Over PS3 In May by Victor Dangelo on 04/06/2007 Views: 277 The Nintendo Wii continues to trample just about everything in its path whether it be in North America, Japan, or Europe. It has done a number on the PS3 thus far. In May it seems that more of the same is happening in Japan as the hardware sales numbers have shown that the Nintendi Wii sales continued to pull Nintendo way ahead of Sony and their PS3. The sales ratio last month was about 5 Nintendo Wii consoles sold for every 1 PlayStation 3 console sold in Japan last month. Nintendo sold though about 252,000 Wii consoles in May in Japan. This is a five to one ratio compared to the PS3 sales in Japan. The PS3 is the most powerful console and still has major Japanese support from companies such as Square Enix, Konami, more specifically Hideo Kojima, as well as other companies such as Polyphony Digital (Gran Turismo) and Naughty Dog (Jak and Daxter.) The lead continues in the handheld department as well with the DS selling 620,670 units in May compared to 123,673 PSPs sold. Nintendos lead keeps growing and at this pace in a few months it could be tough for Sony to catch up fully. Discuss this article in our or login to your account to post a comment.

Privacy group suspects Apple goofed. Staff Writer, CNET News.com Published: June 1, 2007, 6:15 PM PDT Last modified: June 2, 2007, 1:08 PM PDT A correction was made to this story. Read below for details. It used to be that music fans believed cryptic messages about Satan or the death of a band member were hidden within rock albums. Nowadays, the secrets buried in digital music are way too easy to find, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The consumer watchdog group, which focuses on the Web, is taking issue with Apple's practice of embedding customer information within iTunes music. Apple includes customer names and e-mail addresses within song files purchased from iTunes, according to Fred von Lohmann, an EFF attorney. Several tech blogs wrote about the embedded information this week after Apple , a service that features music stripped of controversial copy-protection software. Von Lohmann pointed out that data could easily be compromised if an iPod is lost or stolen. "It's not as bad as losing a credit card number," von Lohmann said, "but it's still information that people wouldn't want floating around out there--especially without them knowing about it." Apple hasn't said why the company would leave customer information exposed. But some observers have speculated that Apple is adding watermarks to music files. Watermarking describes the practice of inserting identifying information into digital files so they can be tracked. Privacy groups frown on such practices, but von Lohmann doubts that these were Apple's Newsmaker: For F-Secure, it's all about the safety net Crave: It's the gear you've gotta see Extra: Don't call it a bubble Mike Goodman, a Yankee Group Research analyst, argued that watermarking is "certainly better than digital rights management. "Watermarking does not treat the consumer like a criminal," Goodman said. "DRM is also restrictive, telling you how many times you can play a song or which device it can be played on. Watermarking works on the assumption that a consumer is innocent but provides the industry an opportunity to catch someone that breaks the law." earlier reported on the personal information within iTunes' music. This story erroneously reported that Apple had in the past encrypted personal information of iTunes customers embedded within music files. The data is available in clear text.

Reach of Law Enforcement Is Tested When Online Fantasy Games Turn Sordid Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday, June 2, 2007; Page A01 Earlier this year, one animated character in , a popular online fantasy world, allegedly raped another character. Some Internet bloggers dismissed the simulated attack as nothing more than digital fiction. But police in , according to newspapers there, opened an investigation into whether a crime had been committed. No one has yet been charged. More than 6 million people have registered with Second Life to create characters that can respond to keyboard commands. Some characters look like their real-life alter egos, while others can take on otherworldly appearances. (Linden Research Â©2007 Via Associated Press) Save & Share Article Then last month, authorities in announced that they were looking into a separate incident involving virtual abuse in Second Life after receiving pictures of an animated child character engaging in simulated sex with an animated adult figure. Though both characters were created by adults, the activity could run afoul of German laws against child pornography, prosecutors said. As recent advances in Internet technology have spurred millions of users to build and explore new digital worlds, the creations have imported not only their users' dreams but also their vices. These alternative realms are testing the long-held notions of what is criminal and whether law enforcement should patrol the digital frontier. "People have an interest in their property and the integrity of their person. But in virtual reality, these interests are not tangible but built from intangible data and software," said Greg Lastowka, a professor at the Rutgers School of Law at Camden in New Jersey. Some virtual activities clearly violate the law, like trafficking in stolen credit card numbers, he said. Others, like virtual muggings and sex crimes, are harder to define, though they may cause real-life anguish for users. Simulated violence and thievery have long been a part of virtual reality, especially in the computer games that pioneered online digital role-playing. At times, however, this conduct has crossed the lines of what even seasoned game players consider acceptable. , the most popular online game, with an estimated 8 million participants worldwide, some regions of this fantasy domain have grown so lawless that players said they fear to brave them alone. Gangs of animated characters have repeatedly preyed upon lone travelers, killing them and making off with their virtual belongings. Two years ago, Japanese authorities arrested a man for carrying out a series of virtual muggings in another popular game, Lineage II, by using software to beat up and rob characters in the game and then sell the virtual loot for real money. Julian Dibbell, a prominent commentator on digital culture, chronicled the first known case of sexual assault in cyberspace in 1993, when virtual reality was still in its infancy. A participant in LambdaMOO, a community of users who congregated in a virtual house, had used a computer program called a "voodoo doll" to force another player's character to act out being raped. Though this virtual world was rudimentary and the assault simulated, Dibbell recounted that the trauma was jarringly real. The woman whose character was attacked later wept -- "post-traumatic tears were streaming down her face" -- as she vented her outrage and demand for revenge in an online posting, he wrote. Since then, advances in high-speed Internet, user interfaces and graphic design have rendered virtual reality more real, allowing users to endow their characters with greater humanity and identify ever more closely with their creations. Nowhere is this truer than in Second Life, where more than 6 million people have registered to create characters called avatars, cartoon human figures that respond to keyboard commands and socialize with others' characters. The breadth of creativity and interaction in Second Life is greater than on nearly any other virtual-reality Web site because there is no game or other objective; it is just an open-ended, lifelike digital environment.

June 2007 Microsoft adds books to Live Search Going one up against its archrival Google, Microsoft has added scanned books to its Live Search. Search Books carries out a full-text search and generates a results list showing title, author, year of publication and a snippet containing the search terms. Searching up one of the scanned books throws up a pane containing cover art, additional publication details and a summary of the book, along with a graphical indication of where the search terms are located. If they are in one or more clusters, it is likely that there is a substantial amount of relevant material rather than just a passing reference. In most cases, the publishers have given permission for Live Search Books to display a limited number of pages from each book, typically between 10 and 35 per cent of the entire contents. Publishers that have participated include Cambridge University Press, Harvard University Press, John Wiley & Sons Publishing, McGraw-Hill Companies, Microsoft Corporation, MIT Press, OECD, Oxford University Press, Pearson Education, Simon & Schuster, Springer, and Yale University Press.

IDC: Open-Source Market to Be Worth $5.8B by 2011 &mdash; A new IDC study has said the growth in adoption of standalone open-source software is accelerating and that the total market will be worth US$5.8 billion in 2011. The market reached $1.8 billion in 2006, and will grow 26 percent annually for the next four years, the firm predicted. The study is a relatively unusual effort to treat the sprawling, quick-changing open-source software market as a serious business, and indicates the growing business acceptance of open-source software. Open-Source Software and Its Role in Space Exploration CIO.com Blog: The Open Source ABC: An Introduction to Open Source IDC found that the open-source market is in a significant stage of growth, as previous barriers to adoption fall away. This is particularly true in the business world, where companies are waking up to the fact that open source opens up more choices and gives them something to use as a bargaining chip with proprietary software vendors. Companies are also becoming more comfortable with subscription revenue as a business model, something common among open-source companies, while larger enterprises are also getting on board. Financial backing from venture capitalists is helping to boost growth, IDC said. Software distribution is growing, but revenues will take longer to follow suit, researchers found. That's partly because much open-source software is free, while other products use a subscription revenue model rather than getting users to pay a lump sum up front.

Posted Jun 4, 2007 12:04 pm PT , Nintendo is adding Zelda II: The Adventure of Link to its roster of downloadable retro games on the Wii's Virtual Console today. The action adventure sequel is one of four new games being released today, including ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron, Milon's Secret Castle, and Dead Moon. Originally released on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988, Zelda II was a significant departure from the original game, replacing the overhead action with side-scrolling combat and giving Link a number of spells to cast to help him on his quest. The series would return to its original formula with The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past on the Super Nintendo, leaving the side-scrolling action adventure approach behind in the process. Zelda II is available for 500 Wii points ($5). The 1993 Sega Genesis title ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron was another side-scrolling sequel to an overhead action game, and it too was an isolated experiment for the series. While the series would return to its roots with ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth for the Xbox, it was only after a nine-year sojourn and the characters' utter absence from the 32-bit generation of consoles. Panic on Funkotron sells for 800 Wii points ($8) A pair of more obscure titles is joining the two odd-man-out installments of those franchises on the Virtual Console's new release list. Hudson's 1988 action platformer Milon's Secret Castle asks players to free an imprisoned princess and reacquire stolen instruments with the help of a magic bubble. Finally, Natsume's 1992 release Dead Moon offers another TurboGrafx-16 shooter to Wii owners. This side-scroller features multiple weapon power-ups, six levels of play, and parallax scrolling backgrounds (parallax scrolling is a technique that moves different layers of the environment across the screen at different speeds, creating the illusion of depth). Milon's Secret Castle sells for 500 Wii points ($5), while Dead Moon fetches 600 ($6). &laquo; Back to Today's News to post a comment on this story! so that makes it over 100 games now, right? Posted Jun 4, 2007 1:58 pm PT to rate this comment RaiKageRyu Posted Jun 4, 2007 1:58 pm PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) A quick note on the Zelda collection discs. There was one for pre-ordering Wind Waker, and another that was only available through subscribing to Nintendo Power. One had all the Zelda games leading up to Wind Waker, one only had Ocarina and a master quest for Ocarina that was previously only from the ill-fated "Bulky Drive". The Master quest disc is the one that was harder to get and more desirable since it was the only way to get that game. I wouldn't be surprised if it showed up on VC though. Those discs regularly sell for $30-$50 used, so all of those combined for the VC is less than tracking down the disc.

I remembered it comes with a 'gold' cartridge and more like an action RPG game. I love the game but I guess most people dont like it. For a game, it is deep in gameplay since you have to find heart containers and have to use your spells and skills to defeat the castles around Hyrule and solved puzzles around towns. The game also has a surprise final boss(dont want to spoil it) that hard at first but can easily be overcome. A definite must-have if you have not played it. Posted Jun 4, 2007 1:48 pm PT to rate this comment sacatash Posted Jun 4, 2007 1:48 pm PT (does not meet display criteria. login to show) Zelda II is one of the most underrated games in history. A lot of people HATED it. I loved it. It was basically the only Zelda game that was very, very, very close to being an RPG. It had a lot of RPG elements like experience points. The heart meter became rectangles. It is vastly different than other Zelda games and an ingenius game. Even though it sold very well, people were ultimately disappointed, so Miyamoto changed the formula back to the original in Link to the Past. The game is one of the most difficult of the Zelda games.

From about 1987 to 1996 there were three core genres in video games. Shooters, beat-em-ups, and platformers. There were others yes, but the vast majority fell into one of these categories. The TG16 had one big advantage when it came to hardware. It could handle larger sprites, with more colors, and more of them on screen than it's competition at the time. Couple this with a huge demand for shooters and you've got the shooter fans' system of choice. In short, the shooter was something that system did very well, and they were easy to localize since there was little to no text. There were many shooters for the Genesis and SNES too, but the VC is looking more at the big titles they had instead of the shooters. To be blunt, the TG16 didn't do very well outside Japan, and they are quickly running out of "quality" games for the VC. Unless they decide to make the CD games (which were often the best games on the system) you're going to see less and less in the way of TG16 games. Bloody Wolf - Top down contra style game. Legendary Axe - platform/action game, one of the marquee titles of the system. Legendary Axe 2 - see above not as good. China Warrior - This was a system seller. Imagine Street Fighter but you had to fight stuff on the way to each guy. The sprites were huge. Deep Blue - an underwater shooter where everything was a fish of some sort, this was before Darius. Cadash - Action RPG, the first Working Designs game. Keith Courage in Alpha Zones - This was the pack-in game for the system and a darn good one. Cyber Core - A shooter were everything was a bionic insect. One thing I miss from Virtual Console is the old box art. Every game should have the box art viewable, similar to itunes. The TG16 is hands-down the biggest offender on hoagly box art. I sometimes wonder if that was one of the contributing factors to its failure. I may have to upload some shots in a post.

I'm not sure exactly which ones were given to who and when though. I got OoT/MQ just by walking into a store and buying it, but a friend of mine somehow to both. I think OoT was just a gift with the first so many copies of the game, and the other disc was a bonus for pre-ordering (it has it's own case so...)

In fact, it was among the first 3rd party games for the system. It's sort of a combination of Goonies II, Alex Kidd, and Mario. It's worth a look if you've got the points to spare. I never cared for TJ and Earl so no comment. I already went in-depth on Link in another report, but to sum-up. It's a very different game in the Zelda franchise and many found it to be the worst in the series. Dead Moon was one of those games I saw in import shops all the time, and the box made it look cool. It's a decent shooter that was better than most at the time it came out in Japan, although other shooters on competing platforms were better by the time it made its way west. Out of the lot I'd say Milon's and Link are your best bet, and Dead Moon if you're into side shooters.

Zelda II was the only one in the series I didn't care for. Don't know too much about Toejam & Earl II since the 1st one was lame. I remember playing Milon's Secret Castle briefly way back when and it was actually a pretty fun action/puzzle game from what I remember. As with 90% of TG16 games, I know nothing about Dead Moon. The only game I may consider this week would be Milon's Secret Castle.

It is NASA&#8217;s responsibility to collect, analyze and release information. It is not NASA&#8217;s mission to make policy regarding possible climate change mitigation strategies But from 2002-2006, it was. Part of NASA&#8217;s mission was to &#8220; protect our home planet To understand and protect our home planet ; to explore the universe and search for life; to inspire the next generation of explorers &#8230; as only NASA can. In Feb. 2006, the mission statement was &#8220; &#8221; to remove the phrase &#8220;to understand and protect our home planet.&#8221; Even a year ago, NASA scientists predicted that because of the mission statement revision, there would &#8220;be far less incentive to pursue projects to improve understanding of terrestrial problems like climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions.&#8221; Top NASA climatologist James Hansen called the deletion &#8220; ,&#8221; because he had &#8220;been using the phrase since December 2005 to justify speaking out about the dangers of global warming.&#8221; In contrast to the previous mission statement, the 2006 revision &#8220;was made at NASA headquarters without consulting the agency&#8217;s 19,000 employees or informing them ahead of time.&#8221; Instead, it was submitted as part of the 2006 Earth Science Research and Analysis budget , which is a joint product of the White House&#8217;s Office of Management and Budget and the NASA Administrator, Michael Griffin. Therefore, Griffin is right. Unfortunately, protecting the earth against climate change is not part of NASA&#8217;s mission anymore. But that&#8217;s because he changed the mission. Close our eyes and will go away!!! - NOT! Comment by Crump's Brother &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ Okay. There&#8217;s that picture of GDumbya and Griffin again. Please. Will someone tell me which one is Mutt and which one is Jeff. p.s. &#8212; &#8220;you&#8217;re doing a Comment by Tom &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ I think it&#8217;s a tragic commentary on our species that individuals like Michael Griffin and his boss have such a large effect on our planet. Comment by NoOneYouKnow &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ the consensus (if there ever was one) is falling apart Comment by ct &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ Looks like a picture of two closet case queers to me. Comment by Tom3 &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ Mr. Griffin&#8217;s job is to mingle in space. Leave &#8220;global warming&#8221; to the EPA, libbies. Comment by CompTROLLER V-1 &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ Leave Global Warming to the EPA? No good. That agency is also run by incompetent Chimpy cronies. The only solution is to kick ALL Repukes out in 08. Every last one of them. Comment by Tom3 &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ CompTROLL is another Repuke closet case troll. He gets a hardon thinking about Chimpy naked. Comment by Tom3 &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ As long as you leave it alone, we&#8217;ll all be better off. Don&#8217;t worry, the adults will take care of it for you. Comment by Crump's Brother &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ The natural resources of the world are being depleted, this cannot be denied and although most Americans have enough to keep them alive is not the case around the worl as thousands of people go to bed hungry each night the issue of global poverty is more serious than ever and it can be changed, there are strategies in place to end global poverty. Thus far $300 billion has been spent on the war in Iraq and less than half of aid from the United States goes to the poorest countries where people earn less than $2 a day. The United States agreed to support the UNâs Millennium Development Goals, a plan to end global poverty by 2015, however according to the Borgen Project the funding to support the end of malnutrition and starvation is under funded by $19 billion annually. Congress needs to become aware of these important issues and make a change. Comment by Kat P &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ It&#8217;s these subtle changes made by Bush that will be our downfall. In a normal administration there would be somebody with some integrity that would stand up to this change in wording but not with the Bush White House. Nobody is qualified for their position so they don&#8217;t stand up for what&#8217;s right or wrong. Comment by shane &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ Griffin claims to uncertain whether global warming is a long-term concern? If the United States were proceed with limited nuclear strikes upon selected targets, they could forward the Neocon agenda at the same time that a mild form of a nuclear winter might at least temporarily counteract global warming. Granted, this probably sounds to many like the script for a cheap sci-fi/horror flick, however, the same could have been said seven years ago if someone had predicted some of the events that have occurred since that time. Need an example? David Ray Griffin (probably no relation to Michael), describes the official government-sponsored conspiracy theory of what occurred on 9/11 as follows: &#8220;&#8230;19 hijackers with box-cutters defeated the most sophisticated defense system in history. Hani Hanjour, who could barely fly a Piper Cub, flew an astounding trajectory to crash Flight 77 into the Pentagon, the most well-protected building on earth. Other hijacker pilots, by flying planes into two buildings of the World Trade Center, cause three of them to collapse straight down, totally, and at virtually free-fall speed&#8230;&#8221; Unfortunately, the preceding represents only one of all too many illustrative examples. Comment by curmudgeon &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ Griffin is wrong on this, of course, but I suspect that overall he&#8217;s a pretty good guy. Unlike O&#8217;Keefe before him, Griffin is an engineer who&#8217;s actually interested in space travel. My guess is, he really wants NASA to return to the moon and send people to Mars&#8230;and he&#8217;s willing to go along with Bush&#8217;s stupid nonsense if it&#8217;ll get those missions funded. Not the noblest approach, but Werner von Braun had some skeletons in his closet, too. Comment by Publicus &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ The EPA doesn&#8217;t operate multi-million dollar satellites we sent aloft for the expressed purpose of monitoring the earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Leave government to the libbies, con-man. Comment by joe &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ Dude, I&#8217;ve flown out of Logan. &#8220;The most sophisticated defense system in history&#8221; it ain&#8217;t. Comment by joe &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ Ah, yes - Gotta love that &#8220;quietly altered&#8221; mission statement along with the signing statements, deliberate refusal to follow our constitution, federal laws, UN laws, NATO laws or any laws of decency. Their actions speak much louder than their words. ps. Did you notice the drool escaping their mouths? Comment by celtic cynic &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ I wonder how much Griffen paid for photo-op with W. Did he have to pay the 25 grand or was he assessed the 5 grand bargain basement price? Comment by WaltTheMan &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ In Feb. 2006, the mission statement was âquietly alteredâ to remove the phrase âto understand and protect our home planet.â Oh, this is soooo typical of the planted stooges (political appointees âAKA compassionate conservatives/religious right-wingnuts) that Bush infected in our fields of science. These stoogesâ purpose, along with Bush, is to destory our nation; and if possible, the world, as well. Comment by Armando Gomez &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ Im sorry but Griffin might be a good guy, but he did the absolute thing wrong here. This lowering of the bar that has happened due to the enormity of the corruption in this administrations existence has to be addressed! It was unethical of him to do that, it was cowardly (not telling the actual employees who ARE NASA!) He might be a smart, educated man but this has a devastating impact on the study of global warming and ALL earth related issues. The bar has been lowered to where people are accepting a much lower standard of what we expect from the people that are working for US. We have got to demand a high ethical standard and competence! I agree, we have to look carefully at ALL depts. because they have manipulated and corrupted them all. How about them wanting to reduce the threat to the spotted owl by shooting bard owls trying to say that that was impacting spotted owls, NOT loss of habitat! It&#8217;s unbelievable and disgusting. Griffin has set an incredibly bad example and should be FIRED. Comment by justice &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ While it&#8217;s true that from 2002 to 2006 NASA&#8217;s mission statement included the phrase &#8220;To Understand and Protect our Home Planet&#8221;, it is not correct, as the original posting suggests, that mitigating climate change was once part of NASA&#8217;s charge. The &#8220;Understand and Protect&#8221; verbiage was added by former NASA Administrator Sean O&#8217;Keefe, a Cheney acolyte who was no more interested in fighting climate change than, well, Dick Cheney. In fact, under O&#8217;Keefe, Earth Science &#8212; long a seperate division with it&#8217;s own $1.2 billion budget &#8212; was merged with Space Science to better conceal the fact that its budget was being raided. Ironically, one of Griffin&#8217;s first actions as NASA chief was to make Earth Science a separate division again and increase its budget. Comment by Space Journalist &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ You know, the beautiful thing about climate change? It&#8217;s not going to affect me, it&#8217;s going to affect your children. Also, if the change becomes so severe that it wipes out humanity, the Earth has demonstrated time and again that mass extinctions happen yet life moves on. Relax. Get some sunglasses, some sunscreen, and make yourself a nice drink - it&#8217;s not your problem. Comment by Namtillaku &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ IF global warming is not an issue, why bother to remove the phrase &#8220;&#8230;protect our home planetâ?? Any way you spin it, removing/changing that phrase makes no sense.&#8221; Comment by Joel &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ Let&#8217;s see. Mars has atmospheric temperatures rising faster than earths. Planting trees either doesn&#8217;t impact global warming or actually can increase temperatures due to albedo. Ocean temperatures may not be linked to hurricane activity. These are all papers that have been published in major journals over the past month or so, and all fly in the face of &#8220;global warming politics.&#8221; The atmosphere is a chaotic system. If the education system actually devoted any attention to physical science education, perhaps this would be better known. Unfortunately, hysteria brings funding, and the more hysteria the more money. If you really want to stop global warming (instead of global cooling we were worried about in the 70s), the government should fund shaded parking in Tucson. The reflectivity of shades would be much higher than asphalt, limiting a great deal of energy that way. Further energy and emissions would be saved by cars having less need for AC. That would really be doing something. Comment by Matt in Tucson &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ The current rate of increase in new cases of skin cancer is the highest its ever been and is out pacing virtually all other cancers and diseases. You say that the climate crisis won&#8217;t affect us or our children. I say, pass the hookah. Comment by Fed the Fcuk Up! &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ I know this may come as a major shock to Mr &#8220;I&#8217;m Just Another Bush Lackey&#8221; Griffin, but he himself has admitted that NASA DOES need to study global warming. Reread his &#8220;denial statement&#8221; closely. &#8220;The agency is responsible for collecting data that is used by the science community and policy makers as part of an ongoing discussion regarding our planetâs evolving systems. It is NASAâs responsibility to collect, analyze and release information. It is not NASAâs mission to make policy regarding possible climate change mitigation strategies.â All the hack has admitted is that NASA can&#8217;t make &#8220;policy&#8221; to combat global warming, not that the agency can&#8217;t STUDY global warming. Has anyone actually argued that NASA is supposed to set &#8220;policy&#8221; on global warming? Simply dropping &#8220;protect&#8221; from the &#8220;mission statement&#8221; doesn&#8217;t absolve NASA of its responsibility to STUDY aspects that affect our ability to UNDERSTAND &#8220;our home planet&#8221;. And part of &#8220;understanding our home planet&#8221; would entail studying the effects of global warming. Of course, Mr Griffin might want to explain just why NASA participated in the Jamestown 400th anniversary celebrations. How does the &#8220;mission statement&#8221; fit in with a 400-year-old English colonial expedition? Mr Griffin may also want to wipe NASA&#8217;s website while he&#8217;s at it since the current homepage, in the &#8220;Life on Earth&#8221; section, lists things like &#8220;Satellites Tackle Pollution Problems&#8221; and &#8220;Checking the Health of Greenland&#8217;s Ice Sheet&#8221;&#8211;the latter article specifically uses the phrase &#8220;global climate change&#8221; in its first paragraph. Comment by JosephW &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ oh man. these people really need to stop sucking so much. Comment by a in pa &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ #24 - you must not have read many of my posts before this - I&#8217;m being facetious. Comment by Namtillaku &#8212; June 4, 2007 @ #23 Well, Matt in Tuscon, that is quite a little parade of debunked talking points you just put up there. I like that part about how the atmosphere is a chaotic system. Sounds real sciency. What&#8217;s your point? Chaotic systems are somehow immune to change even when subjected to strong forcing? You seem to be implying as much. But precisely the opposite is true. Chaotic systems can undergo dramatic changes in response to small changes in forcing. But you don&#8217;t know sh*t about chaotic systems, do you Matt? Never mind chaos, though. You don&#8217;t even grasp basic logic. You say that because Mars&#8217; climate is changing, then AGW cannot be happening on earth. But this argument implies that there can be one and only one cause of climate change anywhere in the universe. This is a preposterously stupid claim.

Celebrities Speak On The American Dream Caring, the Corporate Way Associated Press - June 4, 2007 3:33 AM ET NEW YORK (AP) - It's the Internet equivalent of "Risky Business." A new study says if you launch a search for music or technology, you're likely to come across sites that have spyware and other malicious code. The study from McAfee says some 42% of results that show up with searches like "screensavers" or the names of file-sharing software are for sites that have received warnings from the company's SiteAdvisor service. In many cases, McAfee advises that such sites have programs that are bundled with adware and unwanted toolbars. Despite the proliferation of problems in certain categories, McAfee reports that overall, it's slightly safer to use search engines than it was a year ago. IN THE NEWS: CHICAGO MAN CHARGED WITH POSTING "24" ON INTERNET LOS ANGELES (AP) - He is 24. And he could end getting three years for what he's accused of doing with "24." This will all make more sense once we crunch the numbers for you. Authorities in Los Angeles have charged a Chicago man with federal copyright violations for distributing copies of the tv show "24" on the Internet. Jorge Romero is accused of getting hold of the first four episodes of the sixth season of the Fox tv show -- and uploading them to Live Digital.com. The episodes ended up scooping Fox -- showing up online more than a week before they aired in January. Romero is charged with one felony count of uploading copyrighted material to a publicly accessible computer network -- while knowing the work was intended for commercial distribution. He's to turn himself in at a federal court in Chicago tomorrow, when arrangements will be made for him to travel to Los Angeles. If convicted, Romero could get a maximum of 3 years in prison. ON THE WEB: SOCIAL NETWORKING FOR MOMS CYBERSPACE (AP) - When you think social networking sites on the Internet, chances are you think of teenagers or young adults. But in this case, it's a social networking site for moms. CafeMom is a site that already has some 300,000 members -- but can always make room for a few more.

IN STORES: APPLE iPHONE GETS LAUNCH DATE NEW YORK (AP) - Circle your calendar -- and save up your money. Apple has announced a date -- and price point -- for its iPhone. A company spokesman confirms what its tv ads have been saying: that the highly-anticipated device will be available for sale on June 29th. The iPhone is a combination of a cell phone, media player and wireless Internet device that will sell for either 499 or $599, depending on how it's configured. 1 of its main features is a touch-sensitive screen which is used instead of a keypad to activate the various features. The communications and media playing device is being offered exclusively by AT & T's wireless division, which used to be known as Cingular. by Oscar Wells Gabriel II Oscar Gabriel can be reached at ogabriel@ap.org.

Click me to Chicago man accused of uploading '24' episodes before show's season premiere In this undated file photo, originally released by Fox TV, actor Kiefer Sutherland appears in the hit series "24". (AP Photo/2005 Fox Broadcasting Co., Anthony Mandler) Published: Monday, June 04, 2007 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Federal authorities have charged a Chicago man with copyright violations for allegedly uploading several episodes of Fox's "24" on the Internet before the show's season premiere earlier this year. Jorge Romero, 24, used a Web site to download the first four episodes of the sixth season of "24" and then uploaded them to LiveDigital.com, according to a federal complaint filed in Los Angeles on Friday. The episodes appeared online more than a week before their television debuts on Jan. 14 and 15. Romero was charged with one felony count of uploading copyrighted material to a publicly accessible computer network knowing the work was intended for commercial distribution. He has agreed to surrender at the US District Courthouse in Chicago on Tuesday, when arrangements will be made for his travel to Los Angeles, Department of Justice Spokesman Thom Mrozek said. It was not immediately known whether Romero had retained an attorney. E-mails and phone calls to addresses listed in court documents as Romero's were not immediately returned. If convicted, Romero faces a maximum of three years in prison. CTV adds seven new shows CTV is adding seven new series to its fall schedule and taking three from a competitor.

The spacecraft will make its first flyby of Mercury, shown in this illustration, in 2008. (Image courtesy NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Carnegie Institution of Washington) University of Colorado at Boulder researchers will scan Venus during a spacecraft flyby this week using an $8.7 million instrument they designed and built for NASA's MESSENGER Mission, launched in 2004 and speeding toward Mercury. Built by CU-Boulder's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, the instrument will make measurements of the thick clouds and shrouded surface of Venus during the June 5th flyby, said LASP Senior Research Associate William McClintock, a mission co-investigator who led the CU-Boulder instrument development team. Known as the Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition Spectrometer, or MASCS, the instrument will compare the atmosphere of Venus with data from other spacecraft that have visited the planet in the past four decades. "This is our first opportunity for a close flyby of a solar system object with MESSENGER, and we should be able to tell if the atmosphere of Venus has been changing in recent years, " said McClintock. "As importantly, we are using Venus as a test case to learn more about our instrument performance in preparation for the spacecraft's ultimate destination of Mercury." Carrying seven instruments, MESSENGER will be the first spacecraft ever to orbit Mercury and the first to return data from the hot, rocky planet in more than 30 years. The circuitous, 4.9 billion mile journey to Mercury, which requires more than seven years and 13 loops around the sun, is using the gravity of Venus during its flyby this week to guide it closer to Mercury's orbit. MESSENGER will make its first flyby of Mercury in January 2008, zipping by it again at a top speed of 141,000 miles per hour in October 2008 before flying by a third time in September 2009 and finally settling into orbit in March 2011. "This is a mission that requires some patience," said Mark Lankton, LASP's program manager for the MASCS instrument. "We are anticipating a brief symphony of action at Venus, and we have a lot of data to take in a hurry." Dozens of CU-Boulder undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in data analysis from MESSENGER in the coming years, said Lankton. MASCS's ultraviolet and visible spectrometer will be looking at the cloud composition of Venus. While the surface of Venus is hot enough to melt lead and its atmosphere is filled with noxious carbon dioxide gases and acid rain, Earth and Venus were virtual twins at birth, scientists believe. The miniaturized MASCS instrument, which took more than three years to develop, weighs less than seven pounds and was built to last, said McClintock. "Many space instruments have a lifetime of only three to four years," he said. "But we knew we had to make this one robust enough to work for more than a decade under harsh conditions." The MESSENGER spacecraft is about the size of a small economy car and is equipped with a semi-cylindrical thermal shade to protect it from the sun. More than half of the weight of the 1.2-ton spacecraft consists of propellant and helium. "We like to call it the little spacecraft that could," said McClintock. "This event at Venus will be a very good tune-up for our first flyby of Mercury next January," said LASP Director Daniel Baker, also a co-investigator on the MESSENGER team. "The first encounter with Mercury will be extremely valuable, as it will essentially double the amount of information we now have about the planet." A space physicist, Baker is interested in the magnetic field of Mercury and its interaction with the solar wind, including "substorms" associated with Mercury's magnetic field that occur in the planet's vicinity. Understanding Mercury's surface, tenuous atmosphere and magnetic field are the keys to understanding the evolution of the inner solar system, he said. Mercury was visited only once before by a spacecraft, in 1974 and 1975, when NASA's Mariner 10 spacecraft made three flybys and mapped roughly 45 percent of the planet's rocky surface at the time. MASCS will probe the mineral composition of Mercury's surface, the distribution of gases in its tenuous atmosphere and the workings of a giant, comet-like sodium gas cloud enveloping the planet, said McClintock. The researchers also hope to determine if Mercury ever had volcanoes on its surface and if the permanently shadowed craters at Mercury's poles contain water-ice. MESSENGER is equipped with a large sunshield and heat-resistant ceramic fabric because Mercury is about two-thirds of the way nearer to the sun than Earth and is bombarded with 10 times the solar radiation. Sandwiched by the sun and Mercury -- which has daytime temperatures of about 800 degrees Fahrenheit -- the spacecraft will "essentially be on a huge rotisserie," said Baker. Managed by Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory for NASA, MESSENGER involves about 20 scientists. Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., is MESSENGER's principal investigator. Data from MESSENGER will be sent to NASA's Deep Space Network tracking antennas, then to Johns Hopkins and finally to LASP's Space Technology Building in the CU Research Park.

From real-life murders and underground sweatshops, to money-laundering and child prostitution, virtual landscapes such as Second Life have shown that our migration to online worlds can be as traumatic and destructive as our colonisation of real ones. Be all you can be: Second Life's residents are free to pick their own identity and new partners Second Life has always aspired to recreate society; as it has grown in popularity and population, it has, quite naturally, begun to attract some of the internet's seedier characters. A disturbing behavioural science experiment has begun. William Golding would have been thrilled to witness his plotlines played out in the darker corners of our online islands, where the savagery of avatars drives some to riot and others to assault each other. The appeal of virtual worlds is about to hit a new high, and Golding's pessimistic view of human nature could be tested on a massive scale. The relatively understated offerings from Linden Labs, the company behind Second Life, are soon to be joined by virtual universes from companies that have a proven expertise in manipulative and seductive entertainment. Consider the partnership between Big Brother producers Endemol, with games-maker Electronic Arts, creator of The Sims. These two companies intend to collaborate on a virtual world broadly similar to Second Life, called Virtual Me. While Endemol makes exceptionally addictive entertainment out of five morons sat in a hot tub, The Sims demands that you make sure your brainless Tamagotchi-human eats enough food and goes to bed on time. Combine these two world-leaders in turning banality into light entertainment and we might never leave our homes again. Soon we'll get to see what a television production company would do if they were allowed to plan, police and govern a city. Were Endemol to advertise its virtual world alongside Big Brother, you can imagine the volume of residents such a place would attract, and the kind of environment Endemol might possibly provide them with. Would you want the producers of Big Brother as the architects of your virtual town? Endemol would be responsible for policing this online game: would they take the same view of exhibitionist behaviour in their virtual world as they do in the Big Brother house? Then there's Sony, who are soon to release the PlayStation 3's virtual world, Home - a kind of hybrid between Second Life and the social-networking site Facebook. Again, the audience for this virtual world is massive and could quickly eclipse Second Life. Home is a slicker experience than Second Life, but it's also more insular. Sony's world doesn't have the virtual geography of Second Life - you can't walk between locations, you can only teleport. Most of the action takes place inside your virtual house, or those of your friends. While the basic house is free, it's not a very exciting place to live. You can pay Sony to add the trappings of consumer capitalism - a plasma television, a pool table, wooden floors, and modern art. Rather than meet up in real-life to play a game, Sony have virtualised the experience - you can meet up with friend's avatars and sit around a virtual console - erasing the only remaining real-life human interaction that a hardcore gamer might experience. From what we've seen of Home so far, Sony have been very careful not to make it vulnerable to the problems of Second Life, but as a result, there's infinitely less scope for creativity in Home. The creators of virtual worlds are clearly struggling to find a balance between the freedom to invent in the virtual world, and the need to police them. Careful of the company you keep: disputes in this virtual world have lead to conflicts in the real one Unlike multiplayer online games such as World of Warcraft, there is no broad gameplay element to Second Life, and no way to "win". You don't get points for leading a battalion of orcs into battle or fighting off giant turtles with a cranial drill. Residents are encouraged to talk, buy land, build and trade; its creators pitch it as a benign equivalent of the Wild West. The Second Life tagline reads: "Your World. Your Imagination", but Linden Labs has uncovered what a dangerous proposition this is when you consider what the human mind is capable of. Witnessing human avatars clumsily having sex with virtual animals is one of the consequences of giving perverse minds free rein in a virtual world, but there are more sinister aspects to Second Life, too. Some adult players dress as minors and then prostitute themselves in "age play" scenarios. Just last month, German prosecutors launched an investigation into players who were buying and selling sex with underage avatars. In some cases, the participants were offered child pornography outside the game. Post this story to: Top economist fears Bank of England has lost control.

http://www.fortwayne.com/mld/newssentinel/living/17322682.htm&cid KRT Wire | 06/04/2007 | Universal's gamble: Will consumers win? Monday, Jun 04, 2007 Posted on Mon, Jun. 04, 2007 Universal's gamble: Will consumers win? THE GIZMO: Universal Home Entertainment holds the HD-DVD fort ... and maybe the keys. In what's shaping up as an electronics industry trial of the century_between two incompatible, high-definition video-disc formats_the holdout juror is Ken Graffeo, Universal Home Video executive vice president of HD strategic marketing. And he may very well upset the whole case. Every other Hollywood studio (that would be Sony, Fox and Disney) is either backing the Blu-Ray high-def disc format exclusively or maintaining a Swiss-like neutrality. In the latter camp are the likes of Warner Bros. and Paramount, issuing titles on both Blu-Ray and its close but incompatible rival, HD-DVD, and calling on other studios to do the same. But then there's Graffeo's company. Universal Home Entertainment is the one and only "major" exclusively backing the other combatant in this trial, putting out content only on HD-DVD. That means that if you crave a high-definition disc version of, say, "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" or the futuristic thriller "Children of Men," the first season of "Heroes" (out Aug. 28), or any of the other 100-plus HD titles that Universal will deliver this year, then you've gotta accept his vision and buy an HD-DVD player. What is this man thinking? We had to ask. Q: I imagine the pressure on you is pretty intense when you talk with your studio peers. Having two rival formats keeps most consumers on the sidelines waiting for a winner. How do you respond to that? A: I'd argue that this format war is actually beneficial to the consumer. A little over a year ago, the least expensive HD-DVD player was $799. Now, with Toshiba's current rebate promotion (good through June 16), you can get an HD-DVD player for as little as $299. On the Blu-Ray side, the players started at $1,000 to $1,800 at the end of [2006] and this summer will be down to $599 with new models from Sony and Panasonic. It's the format war that's driving pricing down at such a dramatic, accelerated rate. Q: Why did Universal opt for HD-DVD? A: Several years ago, we looked at the technology and decided that this format would offer the better set of mandatory specifications. From day one, every HD-DVD player made has to have an Ethernet port for online connectivity. And every player had software to support unique, interactive viewing experiences either programmed onto a disc or available online. We're exploiting this on many Universal releases. In Blu-Ray, the interactive specs are still just an option. The only Blu-Ray player now sold with an Ethernet port is the PlayStation 3. A lot of their players can't even support the interactive BD-Java software that's running the two new (Blu-Ray-exclusive) "Pirates of the Caribbean" titles. [Editor's note: The balking Samsung, Philips and Sony players will eventually show the "Pirates" discs but only after a firmware upgrade.] In fact, the Ethernet and Java specs for Blu-Ray won't be fully firmed up until Oct. 31. That's why Warner Bros. is putting out a more sophisticated, online-connected version of "Blood Diamond" on HD-DVD, and also why they've put out "Batman Begins" and the new "Matrix" box sets first on HD-DVD. Q: How about the manufacturing costs? A: Also very important_and lower for HD-DVD discs and players. When you can get below $300 for hardware, you open up the mass market. Now people are willing to jump in and buy a player. Even if the other format were to eventually win, there's no risk. Because that HD-DVD player you buy will still play your regular DVDs and, by upconverting, will actually make the discs look better. I can't imagine Blu-Ray getting even close to a $300 player this year. I expect their lead dog, PlayStation 3 [now $599], to drop $100, but that's it. Q: Sales figures for Blu-Ray movie discs are significantly higher this year than for HD-DVD. How do you counter the argument that the tide has turned in Blu-Ray's favor? A: We didn't have many hot releases in the first quarter, or many releases at all. They had some real biggies, like "Casino Royale." The fourth quarter will be telling. Our releases will be stronger, and we're looking for a big attach rate [that's disc sales per player] when people jump for an inexpensive HD-DVD machine to show off their new high-def TV set. To that end, we're doing a lot to educate the retailers and the consumers. You know, there are now HD sets in probably 25 million households. But more than half of those owners still believe, incorrectly, that anything they plug in_including basic cable and standard-definition DVD_is going to be in "high definition" on those sets. We've got to show them what they're missing. About the Real Cities Network Terms of Use & Privacy Statement

The UK's web fans are spending nearly a day and a half online every month - more than internet users in the rest of Europe or the US. According to an internet activity study by comScore, the UK has the most active online population in Europe, with the highest average number of daily users (21.8 million), the greatest number of days of internet usage per month (21 per user) and the highest average time spent online per month per user (34.4 hours). The research estimates that on an average day in April this year there were 122 million Europeans age 15 or older online - compared to 114 million in the US. The average European accessed the internet - from home and work - an average of 16 and a half days in the month, and spent a total of 24 hours viewing 2,662 web pages. But across Europe there are some wide differences. Germany has the largest online population, 32.6 million people age 15 and older, while the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries have the highest percentage of their populations using the internet. The average Swedish user views 4,019 pages per month - 51 per cent above the European average. The study also revealed Google is the most popular website in 13 of the 16 countries covered by the study, followed by Microsoft in most countries, with Yahoo! coming third. &#8212;Driving Business Through Technology Post a comment about this story in Reader Discussion&#8230; CEO Guide to Tech Byte of the Apple Decoding Dendreon's Wild Ride At 3M, A Struggle Between Efficiency And Creativity Michael Moore Wants to Reform Health Care Six Sigma: So Yesterday?

In yet another &ldquo;broad collaboration agreement&rdquo; to more aggressively go after customers who are working in mixed operating system environments, Microsoft and Xandros today announced to work together to provide &ldquo;system management&rdquo; solutions and intellectual property assurances to bridge the gap between open source software and Microsoft&rsquo;s commercial software offering. Over a five-year period, the two companies agreed to develop interoperable and &ldquo;heterogeneous management capabilities&rdquo; in which Xandros will also implementing the WS-Management set of protocols in Xandros&rsquo; BridgeWays cross-platform management products and will license Microsoft&rsquo;s server communications protocols for implementation in its Xandros Server software. Perhaps most significantly, Microsoft appears to have found an ally in its intent to accelerate the adoption of the Open XML document format in the open source arena. Xandros said it will join Microsoft in developing an open source translator between Open XML and Open Document Format and include it in &ldquo;upcoming releases&rdquo; of its Xandros Desktop software. On a side note, Microsoft also addressed intellectual property rights as part of the agreement: According to a press release, the company guarantees that Xandros technologies &ldquo;are compliant with Microsoft&#39;s intellectual property.&rdquo; will license Microsoft&#8217;s server communications pro Jun 04, 2007 12:13 This is proabably the most important statement out of the whole article. I undertstand that even Linux variants need to charge some money, but this is literally Microsoft's way of getting its foot in the door. What I see coming from this is MS implementing features into Linux, charging for it, and then telling everyone else that its illegal for them to do it. I use MS products everyday, even enlist in their paid technology programs, but this I definetly do not want to see happen. As soon as they can give people a choice (I use tha... Jun 04, 2007 12:51 As soon as they can give people a choice (I use that term loosely) of a Linux distro that "the company guarantees that Xandros technologies &#8220;are compliant with Microsoft's intellectual property." then the lawers are dispatched. Move to Microsoft's Linux distro or be sued. Jun 04, 2007 13:52 Time for the US government to step in and stop MS' attempt to subdue a strong independent competitor. The Linux community should rightfully consider companies participating with MS in this way turncoats and do everything possible to get them to stop this unhelpful (to put it mildly) behaviour. I could care less Jun 04, 2007 14:58 I've got my own favourite Linux distro , it's called Frugalware and you probably never heard of it. I don't really care who MS signs and agreement with, as long as there's code for something and that code is not stolen and under the GPK there's no problem for me to use it or the distro to include it. The can say what they want about pantents and other bullsh*t , I don't think they apply in the EU and I don't care about them even if they do.

That's a broad category of online pages that can offer Web searchers more than they bargained for. The results were a marginal improvement over , which pegged the level of risky search results at 5 percent. The practice of unbridled clicking becomes riskier for Web searchers focused by so-called "sponsored results," the paid ads that appear alongside targeted search engine results, the company found. Nearly 7 percent of all sponsored ads brought clickers to risky sites, according to the study. The study was meant to highlight McAfee's free tool. The free add-on for the Firefox and Internet Explorer browsers tries to give Web surfers a bit more intelligence about the safety of following links returned by the Web's top five search engines. With the software installed, each search result listing is accompanied by a small color-coded, green, yellow, or red icon. SiteAdvisor occasionally will give a question mark to a site it hasn't developed an opinion about that site's security. A green check mark next to a result shows that the software hasn't encountered anything questionable about the site. McAfee grades sites with a yellow X to encourage a Web surfer to use caution. If a SiteAdvisor-aided search result earns a red X, McAfee has received reports of scammy, spammy or outright malicious activity emanating from the site. In the searches ranked in this study, run through May 2007, nearly 7 percent of all sponsored results earned a yellow or red rating. Malicious sponsored links can be especially dangerous because all of the search engines evaluated in this study obfuscate the true or full name of the site consumers will be taken to after clicking. Normally, if a user hovers over a link with a computer cursor, it will display the destination site in the bottom left corner of a browser. But doing this with sponsored links in AOL.com, Ask.com, MSN.com and Yahoo.com usually leads to a gibberish link that pushes the name of the actual landing page out of the browser's viewing area. Google does not show any link in that area for sponsored link results. The results are less troubling than those McAfee released this time last year, when risky sites accounted for 8.5 percent of all sponsored ad results for the most popular search terms. The company attributes the improvement largely to Google's "improvements in paid search safety." I'd like to see a more granular breakout of sites that earned McAfee's red flag because the study lumps together outright malicious sites with those that merely link to sites with questionable practices, or those that spam users who signed up with their e-mail addresses. Also, consider that this study looked at the results of searching for some of the riskiest search terms or words associated with software that often are bundled with loads of spyware and adware.

How about a filter that removes sites Google itself has identified as malicious? Injecting a warning page after clicking on suspects is nice but a true filter would help even more. Posted by: Ken L | June 4, 2007 11:55 AM I think the article failed to discuss what the "security risks" are of inadvertent clicking on bad or malicious links. Are we talking about invasive viruses and spyware, or hardware killers, or just being taken to sites one didn't intend to go to and risking unwanted fees, etc.? I've got two kids who have killed numerous computers with no apparent explanation, and they swear they didn't download anything scammy. Posted by: Hartenstein | June 4, 2007 11:55 AM The post by Hartenstein is valid - this story is pointless without an explanation of "security risks". Instead it appears the author gave more emphasis to a program developed by McAfee, which ironically puts out software that ranks near the bottom (next to Symantic products) of every legitimate antivirus benchmark.

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19028363/&cid Seeing Red, White, and Blu-ray - Motley Fool - MSNBC.com Seeing Red, White, and Blu-ray Another Blu-ray player price cut is on the way. By Rick Aristotle Munarriz In a move that is great for videophiles but humbling to (NYSE: SNE), the consumer electronics giant is once again lowering the price of its entry-level Blu-ray disc player. The BDP-S300, a more compact version of the original Blu-ray players that Sony was selling for roughly $1,000 last year, was introduced in February with a $599 price tag. Sony will now make it $100 cheaper. I know what you're thinking. New products are always priced high to milk the most out of the early adopters. Prices drop as manufacturing efficiencies increase and companies pander to mainstream audiences. However, this is a case where Sony isn't really in control of the pricing at all. With cheaper HD-DVD players on the market, Sony's had a tough challenge to make Blu-ray the industry standard, despite the superior specs over both the HD-DVD and original DVD formats. A combination of butting heads against a rival HD platform and lackluster sales of Sony's PS3 video game consoles have Sony feeling desperate to establish Blu-ray as the next generation optical disc format of choice. Yes, the PS3 was supposed to be Blu-ray's Trojan horse. Diehard gamers would snap up Blu-ray playback capable PS3 systems, unwittingly giving Sony the edge in high-def. The PS2 was the runaway leader in the sixth generation of consoles, so why shouldn't PS3 rule the roost as well? Unfortunately for Sony, wider availability of 's (Nasdaq: MSFT) Xbox 360 and the surprising popularity of 's (OTC BB: NTDOY.PK) Wii finds the company going from gold medalist to bronze in the early stages of gamer adoption. With the Trojan horse not getting through into the living rooms of mainstream consumers, Sony has little choice but to market its stand-alone players aggressively. Engadget speculates this morning that the price cut may eat into PS3 sales. It's an interesting thesis. A lot of people that are on the fence about paying up for a PS3 often justify the purchase on the merits of the console doubling as a Blu-ray player. However, it's not an ideal solution to the quicker and quieter stand-alone players. In making its Blu-ray players cheaper -- in time for Father's Day, no less -- Sony may be competing in a price war with itself at this point. It's not a pretty sight, but it's one that thrifty videophiles would love to see in all its visual glory. Motley Fool Stock Advisor newsletter pick. Microsoft is an recommendation.

http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20070604/apple_confirms_june_29_as_iphone_launch_date-id-104370.html&cid Apple confirms June 29 as iPhone launch date - The Money Times Advertise on this site Tuesday 05th of June 2007 02:46:06 AM - Loans & Credit - Science & Medicine Bollywood News & Gossip Shopping comparison and reviews Apple confirms June 29 as iPhone launch date - June 4, 2007 - 1 comments Apple Inc.'s upcoming revolutionary iPhone, an all-in-one cell phone/iPod/pocket computer which has recently won the required approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), is due to hit the market shelves in United States on June, 29, according to three TV commercials that began airing on Sunday night and posted on the company's Web site. This widely anticipated gadget, which combines three amazing products, a revolutionary mobile phone, a widescreen iPod with touch controls, and a breakthrough Internet communications device with desktop-class email, web browsing, maps, and searching, into one small and lightweight handheld device, is priced at $499 for 4-gigabyte model and $599 for an 8-gigabyte model, Apple said previously. Apple made its long-awaited entry into the cellphone world in January by launching its much-anticipated mobile phone, iPhone, at the annual Macworld conference and Expo in San Francisco. Apple's CEO and chief showman Steve Jobs had unveiled iPhone during his keynote speech at the Macworld conference. Cingular, the Atlanta-based leading wireless carrier and a unit of AT&T Inc., is Appleâs exclusive U.S. carrier partner for iPhone. On Sunday night the new iPhone ads showed off several of the gadget's features, including advanced media player functions along with its ability to take calls, the ability to manage Internet and media tasks, and the function of how to use Google Maps to find a restaurant. The commercials ended with the pronouncement that the combination cell phone will be available "Only on the new AT&T" and "Coming June 29." Of the three ads, one aired before a 7 p.m. broadcast of "7th Heaven" on the CW Television Network. Appleâs iPhone, which was touted as "revolutionary" by Jobs in the keynote, has a built-in camera, five hours of continuous talk time and 15 hours for playing music, and runs Safari Web browser and Apple's Macintosh operating system software. It has Bluetooth, a short-range wireless technology that supports wireless headsets or links to devices like printers, and can connect to the Internet wirelessly via Wi-Fi. Unlike the tiny multiple keys found on existing smart phones, Apple's iPhone has a single button and a 3.5-inch (9-cm) touch screen, and is larger than the iPod Nano. With a black front and silver back, the iPhone according to Apple is the thinnest smart phone in the market having thickness of 11.6 millimeters (0.5-inches). Last month, Apple said the regulators have given their stamp of approval to iPhone, allowing it to sell iPhone in the United States. The approval of FCC, which is an independent executive agency of the U.S. government established to regulate interstate and foreign communications in the public interest, is necessary before a manufacturer can sell a handset to consumers. After revolutionizing the personal computing with its Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, and digital media market with its most popular iPod, the Cupertino, California based Apple is ready to revolutionize the mobile market with its multifunctional device that has such potent qualities which make it potential for revolutionizing the handset industry.

The 570 members of the International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers, which represents the United Space Alliance employees, rejected the company's contract offer Saturday morning, Florida Today reported. United Space Alliance spokeswoman Tracy Yates said the union could strike as early as June 10, two days after NASA officials plan to launch Atlantis. "The bottom line is, a strike would not affect the next launch or the next one after that," Yates said. The company "has a plan in place." The union's negotiating team felt the company's offer was "substandard," said Lynn Beattie, a member of the group and former Local 2061 president. Both sides have agreed to a five-day cooling off period. United Space Alliance remains hopeful that an agreement will be reached before a strike but stands by the company's negotiations, Yates said. "We believe our offer was fair, competitive and responsive to the issues that were raised during the negotiation," she said.

TiVo Announces Launch Plans for Comcast DVR Monday, June 04, 2007 Posted by Tom Spring Study: Dangerous Side of Search Engines Be careful what you search for, you may end up at a risky site loaded with adware or spyware, according to researchers at McAfee. Searches for peer-to-peer file sharing clients and digital music on major search engines have a good chance of delivering you to a questionable Web site serving up spyware, adware, and spam instead of the latest from Coldplay, according to a study released today by McAfee called "The State of Search Engine Safety" The study conducted by McAfee's division revealed search categories such as "digital music", "tech toys", and "to do online" produced between 35 to 50 percent "risky" sites on average when using search engines owned by Google, Yahoo, MSN, and AOL. Overall 4 percent of all search results link to risky Web sites. The good news is search engines have gotten safer compared to data from last year when McAfee found 5 percent of sites linked to questionable web sites. According to the results of the study, the top four most dangerous searches on Google are: 1. bearshare: yielding 46 percent "dangerous" links 2. limewire: yielding 37 percent "dangerous" links 3. Kazaa: yielding 35 percent "dangerous" links 4. winmx: yielding 32 percent "dangerous" links The study defined dangerous sites as those that have one or a combination of the following characteristics: its downloads contain spyware and/or adware; its pages contain embedded code that performs browser exploits; the content is meant to deceive visitors in some way; it sends out inordinate amounts of spam to e-mail accounts registered at the site. McAfee's SiteAdvisor browser toolbar identifies risky sites by flagging them (should you visit one) with a "red" warning or a "yellow" cautionary label that appears in your browser. You can download a free version of the McAfee SiteAdvisor Also at risk are sponsored ads which show up alongside search results. According to the study these links have even a greater chance of linking to risky sites. McAfee says 7 percent of such link to suspect sites (down from 8.5 percent in 2006). we've reported on some of the problems of dangerous sponsored links.

Jun 4, 2007 01:30 PM Toshiba plans to unveil on Tuesday a slim, rewriteable HD DVD drive for notebook PCs. The SD-L912A is a half-inch thick and can read, write, and rewrite to HD DVD-RW discs, and read and write to HD DVD-R discs and to standard DVDs and CDs. The Japanese company plans to start shipping samples of the drive to PC makers next month, Toshiba said in a statement. If the storage and editing of high-definition content increases as expected, then consumers will likely need additional storage capacity. Spurring demand for storage outside of a PC's hard drive are such devices as high-definition camcorders, Toshiba said. In addition, the increasing number of HDTVs is driving the overall demand for high definition content. During the 2006 holiday season, for example, LCD TVs capable of playing HD content led sales in consumer electronics, according to the NPD Group. Spending on LCD TVs soared by 109% over 2005 to $924 million. The write speed for the new drives ranges from 4x to 16x, depending on the disc being written to. Reading speeds have a maximum of 8x on a DVD, and 24x on a CD. A single-layer disc can store up to 20GB of information, which is about four times more than a standard DVD disc. Toshiba is scheduled to introduce the drive in Taipei at Computex 2007, which runs through June. 9. Make IT run. Make IT safe. Run IT run. BigFix IT.Next is now!

Technology Web sites examining iTunes products discovered that personal data, including the names and e-mail addresses of purchasers, were inserted into the files that Apple uses to distribute music tracks, The Times said. According to the newspaper, the information is also included in tracks sold under Apple's iTunes Plus system, where users pay a premium for music that is free from the digital rights management (DRM) intended to protect against piracy. The Electronic Freedom Foundation, the online consumer rights group, said it was possible that the data could be used to "watermark" tracks so that the original purchaser could be tracked down if a track appeared on a file-sharing network, the newspaper said. An Apple spokeswoman was unable to comment, The Times added.

Jun 4, 2007 11:00 AM community is still drawing the line, but Microsoft already crossed it. In a move that defies a forthcoming revision of the license governing open source software, Microsoft on Monday announced an intellectual property agreement with Under the deal, Microsoft and Xandros will collaborate on several commercial and technological fronts with an eye to improving interoperability between Microsoft's products and Xandros' desktop and Linux offerings and other open source products. that open source programs violate 235 of its patents, but its five year arrangement with Xandros includes a pledge not to sue Xandros' Linux customers for infringement. "They'll have the knowledge and security that the comes with all the license rights," said Bob Muglia, a Microsoft senior vice president, during a keynote presentation Monday at the company's Tech Ed conference in Orlando. The problem: The final draft of new license terms published by the group that governs open source software specifically prohibits open source distributors from entering into patent protection pacts with commercial developers. According to the third version of the General Public License, set for final release this summer, open source distributors cannot participate in patent protection deals unless the deal was in effect prior to March 28. GPLv3 also requires commercial developers involved in existing patent protection deals to extend the protections to all open source software users. The new rules, according to the Free Software Foundation, were drafted as a means to "attack" Microsoft's collaboration and patent protection deal with Novell. That deal can remain in place under GPLv3 because it was struck prior to March 28. However, GPLv3 does not offer similar grandfather protection from the clause requiring participants in such deals extend patent protection to all open source users Muglia did not address the apparent conflict between the Xandros deal and GPLv3, but Microsoft's willingness to forge new patent protection accords with Linux distributors despite the prohibitions may be an indication that the software maker believes GPLv3's terms won't stand up in court.

June 04, 2007 | 11:50:55 AM As you've no doubt heard, Apple's finally revealed a shipping date for the iPhone--June 29th. The three TV ads which revealed this info are up on the Apple site , and are well worth taking a look at, since we get a much better look at the phone's functions than we've seen thus far. What I find interesting is the venue for these ads. Apple, launching their most-anticipated product ever (probably), chooses to reveal the release date in ads on 60 Minutes, of all show. The demographics of the venerable news-magazine show tell me that Apple's not worried about the tech-y market--it knows we're eating out of the palm of its hand. Apple's looking for the mainstream right away on this one, perhaps to recoup what must have been pretty large development costs, and that means they need older folks; just the kind of folks who watch 60 Minutes. Maybe Andy Rooney will do a review. "Did you ever notice that most phones have a lot of buttons?" Andy Rooney ........ that's funny. Jun 4, 2007 11:15:57 AM Actually, I'm a 30-something techie who watches 60 Minutes. Some of us like to buck the trend and actually be informed while watching tv. Plus, Apple's commercial stood out big time against the other boring commercials in that time slot. Smart move, I say. Jun 4, 2007 11:34:37 AM Some of us like to be informed, sure. Maybe even most of us. But when's the last time 60 minutes informed us of something that wasn't covered earlier and better elsewhere? I do agree that Apple stands out among their other advertisers.

Atlantis&#8217;s main engines, orbital maneuvering system and forward reaction control system was pressurized this past weekend and the crew&#8217;s equipment has been put into stowage. NASA plans to launch Atlantis despite a vote reached by the International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers, IAMAW, a union that is representing 570 workers that work with the shuttle program, but according to a union spokeswoman, the strike is not going to affect the launching of Atlantis. &#8220;The bottom line is, a strike would not affect the next launch or the next one after that,&#8221; said IAMAW spokeswoman, Tracy Yates. The union voted down a contract because the workers believed that NASA&#8217;s wage offer is &#8220;substandard.&#8221; Atlantis will deliver equipment to the International Space Station and to make repairs to it. Commanding Atlantis for its mission will be Rick Sturckow and Lee Archambault will serve as Atlantis&#8217; pilot. Mission Specialists James Reilly, Steven Swanson, John Olivas and Flight Engineer Clayton Anderson round out the crew to deliver the S3/S4 starboard truss segments, batteries and another pair of solar arrays to the space station.

Hovering over one of these entries brings up a pane containing cover art, additional publication details and a summary of the book, along with a graphical indication of where the search terms are located. If they are in one or more clusters, it&#39;s likely that there is a substantial amount of relevant material rather than just a passing reference. In most cases, the publishers have given permission for Live Search Books to display a limited number of pages from each book, typically between 10 and 35 percent of the entire contents. However, this requires users to sign in with a Windows Live ID, MSN Messenger or Microsoft Passport account. Live Search Books also provides links to online booksellers and where appropriate to the publisher&#39;s own ecommerce site. "We have paid particular attention to ensuring that we are only including books in our index that our publishing partners have given us permission to include, so our customers and partners can feel secure in our stance on copyright protection," said Cliff Guren, director of publisher evangelism within the Live Search selection team. Participating publishers include Cambridge University Press, Harvard University Press, John Wiley & Sons Publishing, McGraw-Hill Companies, Microsoft Corporation, MIT Press, OECD, Oxford University Press, Pearson Education, Simon & Schuster, Springer, and Yale University Press.

Microsoft says it has permission to scan and display books from publishers like McGraw-Hill, MIT Press, Oxford University Press, Simon & Schuster and more. Microsoft has thus far managed to avoid some of the controversy that has plagued regarding copyright concerns. Both the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers have accused Google of infringing on copyrights, despite Google&#8217;s insistence that its book search qualifies as fair use. Rather than presenting users with summary information as Google does with copyrighted works, Microsoft will offer actual content previews where it has permission to do so, though you&#8217;ll have to sign in to the site via a Windows Live ID. One nice feature is that the previews inform the user many pages are missing from each book. Live Search will also include summaries and links to sites where the books can be purchased.

But despite the long, merry autograph lines and the rush for free copies of future bestsellers at this largest annual publishing event in the United States, the business forecast is mixed at best. The 2007 annual trade report from Book Industry Trends, released on Friday, indicated that U.S. sales were flat last year, with a meager 0.5 percent increase in the total number of books sold between 2005 (3.09 billion) and 2006 (3.1 billion). And while the big book chains continue their dominance of the market, independent book stores are continuing to take a hit, their numbers shrinking from 1,660 last spring to 1,580 in 2007, according to the American Booksellers Association. To counter declining sales, the paper-based, brick-and-mortar business of bookselling is increasingly turning to the Web. Sprinkled among the more than 2,000 exhibitors at the Javits Center were three Internet heavyweights -- Google, Microsoft and Amazon.com -- which all announced new marketing tools to help publishers and retailers better sell their wares. Microsoft launched a second segment of its online library. With author and publisher approval, the company now will include copyrighted works in its Live Search Books index, which allows users to find answers to questions by searching the content of specific books. "We are only scanning and uploading and indexing in-copyright content with express permission of the rights holders," said Microsoft spokesperson Clifford Guren. "People love what they see. They're liking it very much." Microsoft began its off-copyright library last December and the company's announcement this week comes on the heels of the controversy created by Google when it announced in December 2004 that it planned to digitize the world's books. The lawsuits from authors and publishers still making their way through the courts have forced other companies, such as Microsoft, to tread more lightly. "The value of Live Search Books has been apparent to most of our publishers," said Guren, "but lots of things had to be worked out. There hasn't been any resistance, just the normal give-and-take. It's been a learning experience for all of us." Among the handful of publishers that already have signed on are Cambridge University Press, McGraw-Hill and Simon & Schuster. Tucked behind the German books exhibit in one of the Javits Center's main halls, employees of Amazon.com were showing off their new Content Acquisition Program. The networking tool allows publishers who are interested in selling rights or increasing distribution of their work to make available online the sales and marketing data for designated titles. Editors viewing the data are then free to contact the publishers of those titles.

It said it was possible that the data could be used to &ldquo;watermark&rdquo; tracks so that the original purchaser could be tracked down were a track to appear on a file-sharing network. Google Street View privacy row iTunes releases copyright free music Jobs meets Gates - the web's verdict , among the first websites to unveil the hidden information, said: &ldquo;Everyone should be aware that while DRM-free files may lift a lot of restrictions on our personal usage habits, it doesn't mean that we can just start sharing the love, so to speak. Sharer beware.&rdquo; An Apple spokeswoman was unable to comment when contacted by The discovery of the data, of which most iTunes users will have been unaware, underscores the reluctance of music groups to allow music to circulate freely over the web. With estimates suggesting that 40 tracks are digitally bootlegged for every legally downloaded track, piracy remains a massive problem for the industry and music groups have largely proven reluctant to withdraw the controversial DRM technologies. Apple had sought to present itself as a consumer champion, with the group&rsquo;s chief executive, Steve Jobs, insisting earlier this year that his company would drop DRM &ldquo;in a heartbeat&rdquo; if allowed to by the labels. Previously, Apple&rsquo;s DRM system had been criticised by several European regulators for being anti-competitive because it only allowed tracks to be played on Apple's iPod digital music players. Apple's iTunes Plus service, launched this week, offers DRM-free music of a higher quality than standard iTunes tracks for 99p a song &ndash; compared with 79p for a standard track. Users who opt to pay extra for iTunes Plus tracks will be able to play the music without limitations on the type of music player or number of computers that purchased songs can be played on. The service is launching with EMI&rsquo;s digital catalogue of outstanding recordings, including singles and albums from Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, Norah Jones, Frank Sinatra, Joss Stone, Pink Floyd and John Coltrane. Steve Jobs, the Apple chief executive, said: &ldquo;We expect more than half of the songs on iTunes will be offered in iTunes Plus versions by the end of this year.&rdquo; Online music sales still account for only 10 per cent of the total market and are not yet growing at a rate which compensates for the decline in revenues from CDs &ndash; approximately 2 to 3 per cent per year. EMI, which has previously released tracks by Norah Jones and Lily Allen without copyright protection, shelved plans to drop DRM on a more widespread basis after iTunes competitors refused to make &ldquo;risk insurance&rdquo; payments designed to offset potential losses that would result from the move. It is unclear whether Apple has made any such payment. Other labels, including Universal Music and Sony BMG, have experimented with offering music without DRM, but none has pursued the strategy as aggressively as EMI. The iTunes Store has sold over 2.5 billion songs, 50 million TV shows and over two million movies, making it the leader in each of those markets. Perhaps people would feel more guilty about sharing music online if the price of tracks fell to reflect the record companies savings in pressing plants, packaging, cover printing, distribution, transport, staffing, shop rent and salaries produced by the download revolution. It might also help if British consumers did not have to pay more than consumers in the rest of Europe (common market anyone?) This is another example of rip-off Britain where consumers are taken for a ride by overpaid and under-talented recording artists and their greedy record labels. I wouldn't pay a pound a track from iTunes to load onto a player that scratches instantly and is only designed to last for a year before the battery fails. Still, ' a fool and his money are easily parted.' For those who don't know, radio stations pay licensing fees in order to broadcast music. The aren't allowed to do it for free. You can open the *.mp4 file with notepad (it will take a while) and see the information right there at the top. If you change it, it will not play in the ipod or itunes. Well hell, since there's no danger why don't we put some sensitive info from Apple or Steve Jobs in there? Shouldn't be a problem since that info's "already out there" right? Apart from that, do bear in mind that when you give any large entity an inch they will want to take a few more yards. This is true for both government and business. At least a business will have limits because it doesn't want to offend consumers though. People are stunned that their name, email, etc., is being embedded in files. In the US where identity theft is so big of a deal and everyone is so paranoid to even list the city they are from on forums like this, in a business sense it doesn't seem like a very smart move. I agree that this information isn't exactly that sensitive. But 1) It opens doors to other stuff (remember Sony's rootkit in their CDs?), and 2) Consumer ignorance can really hurt you. Whether something is true or not is irrelevant when feelings are involved. Gee, guys... my name and often my email address is found in many of the software applications that I have installed on my computer... What's different? It hasn't been hidden. Highlight the iTunes song, click "Get Info" on Macs, click "Properties" on Windows, and there is the so-called "hidden" information. It's been there since Apple instituted iTunes sales. This is merely FUD in anticipation of the WWDC announcements in a couple of weeks and the release of the iPhone on June 29th. Andrew Smith, Stockton, CA I don't see why people are complaining, if you bought a cd or an LP (remember those) with your name and address on it would you see it as a problem? I think not. Just don't buy anything from Apple if it's a problem, I don't. If you have a decent hi-fi even CD only sounds so-so anyway, so I don't see why you would want to degrade it any further unless on the move. Keith , Copenhagen, Denmark How can you possibly equate lending a book to someone with posting music on a website for people to help themselves to!!!? Try this then run off a couple of thousend copies of your favourite book and set up a website were anyone can request a copy for free. .... see how long you can do that for. Steve , Sunshine Coast, Australia There are so many people saying "What's the big issue?" How about for the majority of people out there who are not too technologically inclined and have wireless networks? It's surprising just how many people don't secure their wireless connections and/or don't know which files they are sharing. If a hacker downloads their iTunes music and puts it on a P2P network in the AAC format - who will be accountable? That's the big issue. If we let governments and companies erode our privacy, our freedom erodes too. I have nothing to hide, but it doesn't mean I want everyone to know my business. Oh my god, they embedded my e mail addy....ooooppppps, seems it's required to post this comment as well. If you're all that concerned do the following go to yahoo mail, hotmail, g mail..or any of the other's that exist open an account and use it "Apple's iTunes Plus service, launched this week, offers DRM-free music of a higher quality than standard iTunes tracks for 99p a song &#150; compared with 79p for a standard track." News to me. Didn't realize the hundred's I've spent to date is substandard. I won't buy anything else from Apple. Greg L, vancouver, BC Once again, the producers of multimedia punish legitimate buyers in their mad frenzy to stop the conflagration brought on by the very technology they helped spawn. This stunt by Apple is beyond the pale. The purveyors of media and various digitized services try to breed a culture that thinks it cannot survive without continued bombardment of electromagnetic and sonic waves, and then they nefariously exploit their patrons by charting and categorizing every private detail they can get their greedy hands on, and using that info in ways no sane person would knowingly agree to. As for the people that are "plugged in" every waking hour: I am glad I myself can hugely enjoy taking a printed book off the shelf and getting quietly absorbed for hours. You don't need all this electronic drivel -- cell phones, iPods, instant messaging, etc., etc., ad nauseum -- tagging along with you 24 hours a day. It's enough to rot your brains, to cloud your minds, and who knows what else. Everyone should get the book "I.T. Wars: Managing the Business-Technology Weave in the New Millennium." The author talks about all kinds of liabilities, and solutions and protections in the face of rapid technical change. Of course they are! How else are they going to honor their license with the record companies, which limits the number of times a purchaser can copy it? It's only a big deal if you illegally share your music. If it's sitting on your computer, it's not big deal. Um...this looks like nothing more than attaching a "receipt of purchase" to a item or song instead of a big-brother tracking scheme for piracy (which purpose it also likely serves, so stop committing piracy then). A grocery store would also give me a paper receipt of purchase if I bought some produce and paid cash. I would expect other music services do the same with WMA (Zune Marketplace or PlaysForSure) or even pre-populating the ID3 tags of a standard MP3. You get what you pay for, and you can always throw away a receipt. Does iTunes or Zune Marketplace encode the same user information that they do on purchase of an album from THEIR storefronts (thus also attaching YOUR license to play the song)....as say the same physical CD purchased with cash from the local store, ripped with iTunes or Zune to an 'unprotected' format? Answer me that one. Where's the news here? You wouldn't know this from talking to Steve Jobs, but I scratch my balls almost nonstop. I have some kind of skin condition, and my balls get all scaly and itchey and red. Man they hurt. Anyway, I actually apply baby oil to my balls, and they feel sooo much better. It does soil my pants, so my crotch and anus look wet and stained through my pants, but the itchy ball thing definitely goes away. Chris Reinke, St. Louis, MO Good thing I'm an engineer by trade,and encode my own stuff.Sounds better,at the same bitrate,too. Downlaoding is nothing different that cassette tape sharing in the 70's and 80's. It is not stealing to share your music any more than it is stealing to lend someone your book or cassette and they experience it. The music industry needs to get over itself, stop screwing over artists, and actually signing actual musicians and producers rather than people who just look good on the tele and CD sleeve. Oh, and good song writing would help. If the record company wanted a windfall in profits and stop piracy here's a clue: 1) make each song a $.25 download with the fees split 33% each between artist, record company, & distributor, 2) rather than the record company setting prices at $18.99, slash the price to $5.00 retail and split the $2.50 whole sale price between the artist and record company rather than the artist being lucky to make $.10 on each CD. Who is robbing the artst? The Record Industry of course!!! Santa, North Pole, NJ, USA I read a book. I let someone else read it. The author gets only a royalty on my initial purchase. Why is the music deemed "intellectual property" and protected in perpetuity? When the music "airs" it should be deemed "public" and sharing should be allowed by individuals. The musicians should have to PERFORM live concerts to collect additional monies associated with their "performances" and that is how they should have to make a living...by actually WORKING for their monies, not by living off the perpetual royalties. If radio stations play music, they should pay royalties since the stations are making money off the process, otherwise, sharing should be allowed by free people that want to pass the music along. If the music is so good, then the concert venues will be packed to see the artist live. The musicians are lazy, pompous and self-serving if they don't want to WORK for the subsequent monies associated with their creativity via live concerts. Am I missing something? If I buy a song from iTunes, I immediately dub it to a wav file. Play it once and record it, it's yours forever. No problem, no additional data I think this must be the EFF article The Times refers to David Adams... In his comment, Adams cites Sadun - apparently to suggest that the story is nonsense... but this is what Sadam says: "After removing all atomic meta information from my iTunes plus purchases, the music files still retain distinguishable trace differences that could be used to track the data if loaded illegally to peer-to-peer networks." The Times is just letting people know what's in iTunes tracks. I reckon that most of the people who read the Times don't read Sadun.... Where's the harm in spreading that information? Le peopel make up their own minds. I don't see Adams's point - anybody else? Hey folks, you don't "OWN" the music. You merely have a license to it to use it as deemed by your agreement that you enter into at the time of purchase. You have no right to freely share this music as you do not own the copyright. It was this way with CDs, tapes and LPs. Nothing new here. And artists are going to keep doing their art without pay? What is this? Some kind of sadism? How about I ask you to come out and wash my car each day for free just because you love cars? Sound good? D, from LA, I'm talking to you. This is news!? hahaha. It's not even close to an invasion of privacy, so don't make an excuse for your laziness on not reading all terms and agreement stuff before clicking "I Agree." I couldn't care less because unless you give your music away, only you and Apple have the information - information you gave them in the first place. What did you think they were going to do, delete it after you gave it to them? Mike they didnt exactly announce it in a press release did they? Do you read warnings on cups of coffee before you drink? As long as they try to suck my personal information out of me, I will continue to sanitize and share what I paid for and own. Writing and music and other arts are passions before they are commercial commodities. True artistes will still perform, and writers will still right, as long as there is passion in the world. And they will continue to do so long after Apple is a fading memory, like vinyl records sharing music is no different than listening to the radio. We don't pay to listen to the radio, and personal recordings are free and legal. The industry has created their own quagmire in their greed, now they pay the price. Idiots paying $1 per song are insane. Look. Why don't people just buy the CD and download it. No personal info, nothing What about some naughty hacker embedding YOUR details in a track? and then sharing it.. How to prove that you did not? How many shared tracks will be shared by W gates and S jobs, according to the info in the tracks? Elwin parsley, london , UK they're not hiding it because they tell you it's there. learn how to read the important information before you download. AND STOP STEALING MUSIC Amazon.com will soon offer music downloads and they will be MP3's. Ra, The Florida Keys, one day people are going to stop writing music, books, and movies for you thievers and then you'll have to listen to the local street corner players. your information wouldn't be a challenge if the morons who steal it would keep it to themselves. Mike, San Francisoc, CA lol, GoMusic, Allofmp3, MP3Sugar.........any other Russian site is illegal to use in the US. That's why the US government has forced credit card companies to stop accepting charges from accepting charges from AllofMp3 and why you have to go through Dutch paypal to pay GoMusic. Steve, New York, New York I purchased the biggest, baddest video iPod for my daughter and it was promptly stolen. Now I know that each time you connect to iTunes, they record your IP address and I always had a sneaking suspicion they were embedding and recording additional information. Do ya think Apple would assist me in tracking down the thief? No. They lied right through their little Apple fangs and said it was impossible to track someone through their IP address. People still order from I Tunes? I have been using the Russian GoMusic (19cents a song) for some time now. I get a big kick out of the News that Beatle tracks will soon be available on iTunes. Been there and done that on GoMusic. There is also the Russian MP3Sugar. Already got all of the Beatle songs, and a few hundred others that I wanted from the Russkies.. The Visa and Mastercard charges are processed thru the Dutch version of PayPal, so I do not believe my credit card data is included in the GoMusic tracks. Apple is too obnoxious to deal with a credit card processor, so everyone gets what they deserve by dealing with these clowns. 99 cents a song...what a ripoff. Wake up, music fans...and do not share. jay byrd, Las Vegas, Nevada The article fails to mention that the hidden cyphered data is your credit card information. Read the terms and conditions of your license agreement with iTunes and stop complaining. You own the ipod, but Apple owns you. Music Man, LA, California Aw hell, use a Hex editor and edit your name out and leave blank spaces in it's place. Save. Problem solved. Big brothers big club is now a big APPLE. I just opened a purchased iTunes file with MS Word, and selected "Recover text from any file." Sure enough, my name is right at the top in plain English, and a search found my email address a few pages down. It's not even encrypted or hidden. It's not a privacy issue if you don't share the tracks with other people, now isit? And geeez, just convert them to MP3 if you feel you must pirate them, your information will be gone. Justin, Los Angeles, CA See Chris Breen's article on Macworld / Playlist What has escaped the attention of some is that Apple has always embedded this information in media purchased from the iTunes Store. The implications? In the past this wasn't a big deal because, by default, you could play purchased media only on those computers authorized for that purpose. That's changed now that some purchased iTunes media is no longer protected. Obviously, it would be profoundly stupid to share any media purchased from the iTunes Store on a peer-to-peer network. Its source could be easily traced. A less obvious implication is that you may want to keep a closer eye on your media. Suppose you pass along one of these DRM-free tracks to your buddy and she posts it on a peer-to-peer network? Colin Crawford, San Francisco, CA Been there since day 1, long before the non-DRM stuff ever existed. Furthermore, it isn't hidden. It is in standard fields -- atoms -- within the AAC data stream. Any decent AAC stream inspector will show them to you. So, exactly, what the hell is the fuss? They never give up, do they? Forrest Higgs, Pacific Grove, California I never would and haven't bought one i-Tune In the U.S.A. it would be called entrapment. That is very sneaky. I don't think that without a disclaimer,legal actions resulting from sharing would face a uphill battle RC, Angels camp, USA This is old news. I knew this a while ago when I tried to download another user's song and his email address popped up asking for a password. Wierd. Aren't tracks purchased from itunes protected anyway, with your name/email/password? A friend *tried* to share a song with me once, and I wasn't able to play it. Please, are you serious? This is invasion of privacy? If you are not doing anything wrong (P2P sharing) with the tracks then what the worry? And please save the, "what if a hacker gets my info?" If you have bought a track off itunes than i am sure you have purchased something off ebay or some other e-commerce site. Your data is "out-there", sorry to inform you. What did you expect? iTunes needs to tag tracks to determine how to offer you other songs you may like and the such. Ever notice how Apple suggests other artists and tracks when you are shopping? Well how do you think they do that? Magic? Save the theatrics and go about your business. if it is bye-bye itunes for you than go find another company that offers a similar service with the equal content as Apple. Oh, what was that? You can't? Exactly. So your account is tied to a track, get a life. You have more to worry about. ok the big fuss is that they're hiding information from us that has our information on it. It doesn't matter if it's only a name and e-mail, that could just be the start. once you give them a little they want more. Remember all small things turn into big things and this could just as easily happen. If you click "Properties" for any file I bought on iTunes my info is there. It has been there since day 1....Whats the big deal? Will I have to report my music "stolen" so I am not liable if its found on a sharing service..No...because nobody shares AAC files anyway...the converted mp3's have no personal data attached..... Next, Bulls Gap, TN Well, I guess the fuss is that they've kept quiet about it. If they're embedding my name in it, I want to know about it. If they tell me upfront, then it's fine. It's all this secrecy that bugs me...2 Dave Allen of Glasgow. In what sense is your privacy invaded? itunes have imbedded your name and email adress in music you have purchased from them. You supplied the information willingly and itunes sent it back to you. As long as you dont go sending those music tracks out into the internet that information will never be seen by anyone else. I dont see what the fuss is about. This will have no ewffect whatsoever upon iTunes usage. The fact is the only people who have to worry are those who pirate or give away the music to others for free on file sharing networks. At the end of the day such actions are criminal and should be dealt with as such. So what is the fuss all about??? Gareth Williams, Cardiff, UK Yup, final straw for itunes here. They can't have it both ways. I have no problem with this data being embedded in my tracks. I also wouldn't care if they turned out to be 'watermarking' songs. The only legitimate objection to iTunes DRM was (and is) that it limited your freedom to use music which you had bought legally in a variety of different devices. Maybe they should have put it in the T&Cs, though... John Allen, Oxford, UK I don't take kindly to invasion of privacy.

Halo 3 puts the pressure on GTA IV 06/04/2007 | 8:18:09 AM PST There may be enough room for only one blockbuster title this fall, leading some analysts to speculate a delay for the release of Grand Theft Auto IV, which has been so far scheduled to go on sale starting this October. Microsoft and Take Two bring out the big guns this fall It's no small secret to time-strained gamers that the usual summer release drought is followed by a hectic deluge of some of the year's biggest games meant to take advantage of the holiday sales rush. According to reports by , Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Michael Pachter speculates that the intense holiday competition from Bungie's may force a delay for Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto IV , highlighting the rising contention for attention of arguably the two most anticipated titles this fall. has been set for an October 16th, 2007 release, Pachter commented that Take-Two may choose to push its expected blockbuster's release beyond its current financial year, which ends on October 31st, 2007. The reason for this is due to Bungie's that Master Chief would be coming to the Xbox 360 on September 25th, -- sooner than most gamers expected. "We believe that it is possible that the company will choose to 'throw in the towel' on [Take-Two's 2007 financial year] by shifting the release date for Grand Theft Auto IV by a few weeks, increasing the losses incurred this year and improving the company's prospects for [the next financial year]," Pachter said. Pachter added that such a delay may not be motivated solely by financial calendaring, but that extra space in the release gap could also could serve to give gamers a bit more time to refill their coffers after the release, which features two , consumers on a budget may be forced to choose between these two high profile games this fall. Have a Xbox 360 question? Keep in mind that this is only analyst speculation, but even if it were confirmed to be true, it wouldn't necessarily be considered a bad thing. After all, it gives Rockstar more time to tweak the game, and allows gamers a chance to take a breather between both blockbuster titles, which will undoubtedly release at the hefty price tag of $60 or more. And if it happens to help Take Two impress its investors by vastly improving their 2008 portfolio, then so be it.

Go to a Section: 4:41PM EDT, Mon 4 Jun 2007 MySpace to seek court help to release predator e-mails Mon Jun 4, 2007 9:16AM EDT Kids socialize in a virtual world as avatars Web, computer "widgets" offer branding opportunities Mobility to reign at world's No.2 computer show Microsoft starts Ignition for music promotion NEW YORK (Reuters) - News Corp.'s MySpace filed a request on Monday in a Pennsylvania state court to seek guidance on how it can legally provide local authorities with the private e-mails of convicted sex offenders who had lurked on its service. A federal law prevents Internet service providers such as MySpace from turning over a user's electronic communications without a search warrant. But obtaining search warrants is difficult for offenders not currently under investigation. The request comes after some U.S. state authorities, including Pennsylvania Attorney General Tom Corbett, began seeking more information on convicted sex predators who they worry could be using MySpace to find child victims. "We got the court order from Pennsylvania Attorney General Corbett, which we can't comply with," MySpace general counsel Mike Angus said in a phone interview. The resolution is seen as a test case for how local U.S. authorities and MySpace can cooperate in sharing information without violating federal law. MySpace and a coalition of U.S. attorneys general reached an accord in May on how the Web service could turn over information on convicted offenders who register on its site. MySpace said it has deleted their profiles from its service, but retained their information in its database. MySpace has provided the profiles of offenders, such as names and addresses, a process made easier after it contracted background verification company Sentinel Tech Holdings last year to develop a national database of registered sex offenders. Before the database's launch in early May, sex offender data was collected on a local level, making nationwide searches difficult. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

http://www.infozine.com/news/stories/op/storiesView/sid/23271/&cid Kansas City infoZine News - EarthTalk: Censoring Federal Climate Scientists - USA Monday, June 4, 2007 Current User :: Guest Add your news directly to the infoZine web site login or create new user account Sunday, June 03, 2007 :: EarthTalk: Censoring Federal Climate Scientists Dear EarthTalk: How is it that the Bush Administration is said to have "censored" climate scientists? -- Anna Edelman, Seattle, WA Westport, CT - E/The Environmental Magazine - infoZine - Word of the White House censoring federal climate scientists on global warming began leaking out to the press early in George W. Bush's first term in office, but only in the last few years have a few federal employees themselves been willing to go on record with such accusations. A report released last January by two leading nonprofits, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) and the Government Accountability Project (GAP), found that nearly half of 279 federal climate scientists who responded to a survey reported being pressured to delete references to "global warming" or "climate change" from scientific papers or reports, while many said they were prevented from talking to the media or had their work on the topic edited. "The new evidence shows that political interference in climate science is no longer a series of isolated incidents but a system-wide epidemic," says UCS's Francesca Grifo. "Tailoring scientific fact for political purposes has become a problem across many federal science agencies." The issue first bubbled to the surface when Rick Piltz, who worked for a decade coordinating federal research on global warming as part of the U.S. Climate Change Science Program-first under President Clinton and then Bush-quit in mid-2005 alleging that his superiors were misusing and abusing the scientific information he was providing. Piltz told reporters that Phil Cooney, an official with the President's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) who worked for an oil industry trade group before coming to the White House, had been editing and altering documents published by the program. "The changes created a greater sense of scientific uncertainty about observed climate change and potential climate change," said Piltz. Soon after Piltz's accusations became known, Cooney left CEQ to work for ExxonMobil, which has itself been accused of publicly misrepresenting the science of global warming. Just when the brouhaha stirred up by Piltz appeared to be dying down, National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) climate scientist James Hansen, who has been sounding alarms about global warming since the 1980s, rekindled the debate by telling reporters that NASA public affairs staff, under pressure from the Bush administration, were trying to censor his lectures, papers and website postings and keep him away from journalists. In response, NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin vowed to support "scientific openness" on climate and other topics. But openness is only a first step. Says Piltz: "Even if we succeed in lifting this heavy hand of censorship, there is still the problem of getting the political leadership to embrace the findings put forward by the scientists."

It wont take years of training, and your commitment to space travel can be over in 30 minutes or so, depending on how long the lines are. Of course, it doesnt really go anywhere. But for a few minutes, as you tip backward in your seat and let the special effects of the simulated rocket ride take hold, its easy enough to suspend disbelief. Thats the appeal of the Shuttle Launch Experience, a $60 million attraction that opened last weekend at Kennedy Space Centers Visitors Complex in Florida. With input from 27 current and former shuttle astronauts, designer BRC Imagination Arts, spent years crafting an experience that would come as close as possible to a real shuttle launch. BRC chief Bob Rogers says the experience is more than a ride. Before people strap in, they get to hear a breezy, lecture about space shuttle technology given by veteran astronaut Charlie Bolden, he said. Its a good overview of the program, though the Shuttles impending retirement may make the details a bit irrelevant. The shuttles are being mothballed in 2010 because they did not meet their original intent of delivering people and cargo to low-Earth orbit safely, cheaply and often. There is no better reminder of this than the fact that after 25 years of Shuttle flights, ordinary people are relegated to a simulator, however realistic it may be. Nevertheless, the Shuttle Launch Experience is a good ride, with enough sound, vibration and special effects to launch imaginations, if nothing else. But for those who actually want to rocket into space, the experience might fall flat. At the end of the launch, the shuttles cargo bay doors open, and while the sight that unfolds may well be state-of-the-art, with an orbital view of Italy projected onto a curved screen and a black-sky background flecked with moving stars, it may be hard not to feel a bit let down.

The shittle was a bad, half-assed compromise from the start, and now all we have left is a Disney ride? Monday, June 04, 2007 Is the shuttle going to be replaced with a vehicle that will provide "people and cargo to low-Earth orbit safely, cheaply and often?" Hardly. The so-called "crew exploration vehicle" has drastically less capability for servicing the ISS and it cannot deploy or service satelites such as Hubble. By retiring the Shuttle, the country will be walking away from a $200B investment in ISS/Shuttle infrastructure that could lead to solar power generation, space tourism, and long-term research benefits. For what are these benefits being abandoned for? Sending 3 or 4 astronauts to the moon for no reason? Yes, NASA hq. oversold the "routine" nature of Shuttle flights. Going into space with the limits of present technology is, and will remain, (1)very expensive, and (2) very dangerous. However, it is a shame that the United States is going to abdicate its present leadership in manned spaceflight that it has established with the Shuttle/ISS technology. The decision to retire the Shuttle fleet reveals, like the decision to invade Iraq, that the present administration lacks the wisdom to make the right calls on the big issues.

When Sony announced the BDP-S300 player in February, it put the price at $599, but it has now set a list price at $499. That means the new player costs half of what the company's first Blu-ray player cost when it launched just six months ago _ probably one of the fastest price declines in the consumer electronics industry. The new player has essentially the same capabilities as the older BDP-S1 but is smaller. The price cut is due to falling production costs and the growing demand for Blu-ray products, according to Chris Fawcett, vice president of Sony Electronics' home products division. Sony has been undersold in the market for high-definition disc players by Toshiba, which created the rival HD DVD format. Its players are now selling for less than $300, 14 months after Toshiba's first player appeared in U.S. stores. Neither Blu-ray nor HD DVD players have caught on strongly with consumers, who have been waiting for the market to settle on one of the formats. But dropping prices for players and HDTV sets in more homes mean a big showdown between the discs may be looming this holiday season. Hollywood studios are split on the issue, but Blu-ray has the strongest support. Most people buying Blu-ray discs are apparently buying them for their Sony PlayStation 3 game consoles. The cheapest version of the console costs $499, but its game-oriented wireless controller and relatively loud fan makes it a less than ideal movie player.

ToeJam is, in fact, funky Virtual Console Monday: Nintendo's new offerings for 6-04-07. ToeJam is, in fact, funky | Published: June 04, 2007 - 10:37AM CT When we reported on Nintendo&#39;s major success with the Virtual Console , we also let you know that you could expect today to mark the 100th game on the service. Oddly enough, Nintendo is also releasing three more games today for a total of four, but it wouldn&#39;t have been as dramatic if were to be the 100th game, would it? Here are the other three games. Milon&#39;s Secret Castle ( NES, 500 points or $5 Annoying, hard, and it probably requires a walkthrough: this is not one of my favorite NES memories. There is an odd side-quest involving music boxes and unlocking elements of a song, but overall this is one platformer that will probably only attract people who suffered through it in the past and thus have nostalgia&mdash;or those that hate themselves. ToeJam and Earl in Panic on Funkotron (Genesis, 800 points or $8) Imagine this is what is pitched to you: would you have decided to move ahead on this game? ToeJam and Earl must track down the Earthlings in order to capture them in large jars and ship them back to Earth in spaceships. It is also their funky mission to find 10 beloved objects belonging to Lamont the &ldquo;Funkapotamus,&rdquo; the source of all funk in the universe, so they can persuade him to return to his favorite funk-filled planet. ToeJam and Earl must use their &ldquo;funk powers,&rdquo; such as Funk Move and Funk Scan, to assist in evading and capturing the Earthlings. It&#39;s helpful that this is the sequel to the popular . This game is a 2D platformer instead of the original isometric, wandering game play. Still, this isn&#39;t an $8 game. (Turbografx 16, 600 points or $6) This could be seen as a good thing or a bad thing. We have our weekly 2D shooter from the Turbografx 16&mdash;this time it&#39;s a horizontal scroller&mdash;and it&#39;s another attractive game that does the shooter thing competently. While there are certainly better ways to spend $6, there are also many worse ones. I&#39;m not sure how they determined that was the 100th game&mdash;maybe they hit the button to make it go live last&mdash;but there isn&#39;t much to get excited about this week.

The whiny: apparently Apple embeds your full name and e-mail in these files. After further review, discovered the company does this for all their files, DRM or no. But now you can host these tracks for all the world to borrow, right! Isn&#8217;t that part of the deal? You can strip out the information by converting the file, which of course defeats the purpose of paying good money for higher quality tracks. Privacy concerns are one thing, but if Apple continues on their previous policy in a way that might just limit file sharing, well, it&#8217;s hard to get too amped about it. In somewhat more interesting news, runs a test to see if people can actually tell the difference between normal iTunes files and the new higher bitrate bitties. The quick answer: no, although they don&#8217;t say which tracks they use for testing. Try listening to Aphex Twin at a low bitrate and get back to me.

Master Chief Sucks At Halo? Posted by Daniel on Monday, June 4th, 2007 at 2:59 pm By now, everyone should know who Master Chief is and everything that he&#039;s been through in Halo. But how would a Master Chief doll do at playing the Halo 3 beta? One would think that since he&#039;s an action figure version of Master Chief, he&#039;d pretty much be as good as Master Chief himself, right? According to Digital Ph33r, the makers of the video, Master Chief sucks at Halo. In the video, you&#039;ll witness how painstakingly long it is just to get into the Halo 3 beta and you&#039;ll also see what Master Chief really thinks about Gears of War. One other thing that I got a good laugh out of was everytime Master Chief spoke into the microphone to chat with other players, how the video would show his action figure head moving into the mic to speak.

Bioshock &#039;EGM Preview&#039; Video Posted by Daniel on Monday, June 4th, 2007 at 12:39 pm The 1UP Show this week featured a sit down interview with on of the developers of Bioshock to discuss what we can expect when we visit the underwater city of Rapture later this summer. The discussion really does shed some light on what Irrational Games wanted to do with the game and what they were able to accomplish. One point in the video I liked was the fact characters in the world are never in the same place twice. Each and every time you visit a place in Rapture will be a new experience. Enough talk, check out the video!

You take fantasy and magic, science and cyberpunk - mix them together and you have a setting that is overflowing with potential. Microsoft&#039;s latest multiplayer shootfest takes good advantage of the fictional setting of its originating game ( a pen and paper RPG) and changes things up enough to make it stand out in the realm of cookie cutter team based shooters. Looking back at the history of the series, this title breaks every expectation by being a shooter. has years of story and the previous games all pretty much focused on role-playing and adventure style mechanics. for the 360 and Windows Vista is nothing like them. Instead we get a game populated by fantasy races like elves, dwarves and trolls as well as âNeuromancerâ style cybernetic augmentations, smart guns and âThe Matrixâ but the core idea is to team up and shoot your enemies and not in the tradition of Riggers and Street Samurai.

That includes the Neo-geo CD, Neo-geo CDZ, and the Neo-geo Pocket. Even though SNK stopped production of its Neo-Geo systems almost 10 years ago, it has continued to provide maintenance and technical support for them. Now however, it seems finding spare parts for repairs has gotten too difficult for them to continue offering the service. If you need a system repaired, you&#039;d better get it sent into them soon.

Sweeney Talks Unreal Engine 3 and UT 3 Technology Posted by Shawn on Monday, June 4th, 2007 at 10:37 am Count this as an obscure article - at least for we American readers - but Tim Sweeney, founder of Epic Games, talked with German PG Games Hardware magazine a few weeks back about some of the enhancements in the Unreal Engine, DirectX 10 support and the upcoming . Sweeney also mentioned how Gears of War&#039;s development has influenced the Unreal sequel: PCGH: Are there any things you learned while developing Gears of War for next gen consoles that you can now benefit from when finalizing UT 3 for the PC The Gears of War experience on Xbox 360 taught us to optimize for multi-core, and to improve the low-level performance of the key engine systems. This has carried over very well to PC. The division of UE3&#039;s rendering and gameplay into separate threads, implemented originally for 360, has brought even more significant gains on PC where there is a more heavyweight hardware abstraction layer in DirectX, hence more CPU time spent in rendering relative to gameplay. Also, the 360 work we did resulted in an engine that also runs well on low-end and mid-range PCs. This is very important for games today; the high-end PC gaming market alone is not big enough to support next-generation games with budgets in the $10-20M range. You need to run on ordinary mass-market PCs as well. In reading PC gaming websites, one might get the impression that everyone owns a dual-core PC with a pair of $600 GPUs in SLI configuration, but the reality is very different. More than 80% of PCs sold today are still single-core, and have very low-end DirectX9 graphics capabilities. Unreal Engine 3 supports those configurations well. There really isn&#039;t a lot of solid info but the and Unreal Engine information is at least interesting for hardware minded folks. ESRB Initiative Supports Indie Retailers Posted by Shawn on Monday, June 4th, 2007 at 10:19 am Forests beware. The Entertainment Software Rating Board ( ) and entertainment product distributor Ingram Entertainment Inc. have announced a new initiative in support of Indie Retailers. 10,000 independent and small chain retailers nationwide will receive ready-to-use in-store signage explaining the ESRB rating system and supporting store policy of denying sale of M rated video games to children 17 and under. âThe ESRB actively supports retailers in their efforts with respect to the sale or rental of video games, and their support of the ratings has been tremendous, as evidenced by the most recent report from the FTC,â said ESRB president Patricia Vance. âOur partnership with national retail outlets continues to be strong, and with the help of Ingram Entertainment weâre helping smaller, independent retailers across the country inform their consumers about the rating system and support their store policies.â What this means for the consumer is more signs and shelving strips to inundate those parents who just don&#039;t get the ESRB ratings. Bob Geistman, chairman of the Entertainment Merchants Association (EMA) and Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Ingram Entertainment asserts that this initiative can only bring retailers and consumers closer together. âIndie retailers are a vibrant and significant part of the video game market, tending to offer a neighborhood environment that endears them to their customers. Providing this signage to these thousands of stores will undoubtedly help foster that unique and personal relationship by enabling stores to offer their customers information that is vital to the way they buy and rent games.â This article is rated E for everyone. Lion&#039;s Gate Profits from Xbox Live Posted by Shawn on Monday, June 4th, 2007 at 10:17 am has the latest figures released by movie company Lion&#039;s Gate Entertainment. The company has a number of downloadable assets on Microsoft&#039;s Xbox Live service and is claiming a 50% boost in profit from downloads. &#034;Our VOD revenues grew by approximately 50% in fiscal 2007 from the previous year,&#034; said Lions Gate&#039;s Feltheimer, adding, &#034;our Internet delivered digital revenue grew by a multiple of 7 in fiscal â07 compared to the prior year, although obviously from a relatively small base.&#034; Employee of the Month , both Lion&#039;s Gate properties showed up on Major Nelson&#039;s best seller I&#039;ve personally only rented one film from the service so far, and I&#039;m not likely to do it again honestly. There is something about the digital limits imposed that just don&#039;t thrill me - especially when DVD offers special features and unlimited rewatching thanks to Netflix or purchase at Best Buy. Maybe I&#039;m just not the right consumer for these services though - I like physical things. RollerCoaster Tycoon Illustrates Housing Market History Posted by Shawn on Monday, June 4th, 2007 at 9:53 am The US Housing Market has been quite a wild ride. It had it&#039;s up the last several years although currently it&#039;s going down. has posted a unique graphical representation of the US markets rise and fall over the years. Richard Hodge posted A History of Home Values from 1890 to today as a roller coaster generated with . The data was compiled by Yale economist Robert J. Schiller. A more traditional graph accompanies the video for those of you who get motion sickness on roller coasters.

According to , Agetec will be releasing a new edutainment title for the Nintendo DS, . The title covers the basics of music theory including reading notes and time signatures and understanding chord make up. The game promises to make learning music fun. &#034;Educational games that are truly fun are hard to come by. Rhythm &#039;n Notes gets it right with addictive, enriching play,&#034; said Mark Johnson, producer at Agetec. The format is keyboard based and has a practice mode for players to get into the swing of things. Look for to hit the shelves this Fall. Pachter: Expect Closure, Delays from Take Two Posted by Shawn on Monday, June 4th, 2007 at 9:03 am In an article at , Michael Pachter, analyst for Webush Morgan says that changes are afoot for struglling publisher Take Two Interactive int he wake of recent management changes. He says that the company&#039;s fiscal forecast isn&#039;t as cheery as it once was and the new power players are looking to streamline business by reducing studios and playing safe in anticipating profit from upcoming game: &#034;We believe that new management understands what is required to turn the companyâs fortunes around, and believe that they will take prudent steps to return the company to profitability. However, we believe that there are significant structural changes required in order to control costs, and believe that these changes will take more than a year to complete. On the revenue side, new management is saddled with the decisions made by the prior management for at least another year, and we do not expect new games such as The Bigs, All-Pro Football, Fantastic Four, or The Darkness to be wildly profitable. We also think that the new management will take steps to cut costs as soon as practicable, resulting in studio closures and charge-offs for games in development.&#034; , Pachter also thinks it likely the company&#039;s premiere title - Grand Theft Auto IV - will see some shifting of its release schedule. Could Take Two make expectant fans wait even longer? Much of Pachter&#039;s analysis is aimed at shareholder panic and behavior but I have to agree that many of the Take Two titles are not going to hit big this year - especially in the field of competitive sports where Electronic Arts is king.

Read the full article My Picks For The Top 20 Games of All-Time Posted by William on Sunday, June 3rd, 2007 at 11:05 pm Without a doubt in my mind, the greatest game of all time is Final Fantasy VII which was released in 1997 for the PlayStation. FFVII gave turn-based gameplay new meaning and pushed the boundaries of console RPG games. 10 years later, it&#039;s still fun to play and was an obvious influence on numerous games over the years. Extremeley fun gameplay combined with an awesome story, Final Fantasy 7 will always remain a top favorite of many gamers including myself. Feel free to debate my list in the comments. My top 20 follows the break.

So what did Konami have to say about this? Well, unfortunately not much really. recently tried to get an answer out of them, but were only told that the idea was just &#034;speculation.&#034; So they didn&#039;t confirm the rumor, but they didn&#039;t deny it either; so there&#039;s still a chance it could happen. My guess is that maybe the idea of bringing the game to the Xbox after it&#039;s had a run on the Playstation is currently in talks. We&#039;ll just have to wait and see.

The AGâs comments follow an announcement last month by the Los Angeles, California-based company that it would turn over to law enforcement key information about registered sex offenders, who critics have said use the site to seek out potential victims. âIt seems like at every step of the road, thereâs a new legal obstacle generated by MySpace,â said Nils Frederiksen, a spokesperson for Pennsylvania Attorney General Tom Corbett. Mr. Frederiksen was responding to MySpaceâs request on Monday that a state judge review the attorney generalâs May 25 order that the social networking site turn over records for all registered sex offenders in . MySpace last week handed over records of 47 registered sex offenders, but the company excluded the content of private email messages from two users. âWe want to provide these messages and today have filed a request with the state court in Pennsylvania, asking a judge for guidance on how best to provide the email content without tainting any potential evidence that could help put a registered sex offender behind bars,â said MySpace general counsel Michael Angus in a statement. In court documents, MySpace said it believes the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) bars the company from disclosing the content of a userâs email messages without a search warrant. The company was not available to immediately respond to the attorney general's comments. Mr. Frederiksen said the attorney general believes MySpace is overstepping its authority. âThe last time I checked, we were the law enforcement agency, not them,â he said. for Internet & Society Executive Director John Palfrey said MySpace is being a good corporate citizen as it tries to navigate the âincredibly murkyâ waters of the ECPA. âI think that MySpace is doing absolutely the right thing in being extremely cautious about the privacy of its users,â Mr. Palfrey said. âThe job of the attorney general is to request the information that it needs to prosecute wrongdoers under the law,â he said. âI think the appropriate tug of war that occurs is between the prosecutor who wants as much as possible and the company that wants to protect its users, where they are innocent.â The attorney general filed a response to MySpaceâs request late Monday afternoon, but his office woudl not immediately provide details.

Sony Slashes Blu-ray Player Prices June 4, 2007 9:21AM With Sony's decision to slash the price of the BDP-300 Blu-ray player -- likely a response to Toshiba's lower-cost HD DVD players -- some are now speculating about whether the PS3 will see price drops in the coming weeks. The PlayStation 3 comes with a built-in Blu-ray player, which was partially to blame for the console's delayed ship dates. Open Source a $6B Industry by 2011 Microsoft, Xandros Sign Patent Deal China Puts Moratorium on Internet Cafes RealPlayer Offers One-Click Downloads Study Finds 4 Percent of Links Malicious Sony is slashing the price of its new BDP-300 Blu-ray disc player, which will be available in retail outlets for $499. That's $100 less than originally announced. In fact, just six months since its market debut, Sony has cut the price of its Blu-ray player from $999 to $499, a 50 percent reduction that took traditional DVD players about two years, according to Envisioneering Group data. When DVD players launched about 10 years ago, the price tag was $1,000. A year later, it was still $800. Two years later, retail cost finally dropped to $500. Sony's advantage is that it manufacturers its own blue laser diodes, a key part of the next-gen players. "Sony is passing on some of the manufacturing savings to customers," said Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering Group. "The inability to manufacturer enough diodes was a headache for the PS3 last winter, but now Sony has enough to allow these half-price players." Sony's decision to slash the price might be a response to rival Toshiba's retail rebates. Toshiba uses the competing HD DVD format in its players. The companies are engaged in a bitter battle over which standard will reign supreme in the market. Banking on subsidies to help get its HD DVD players into consumers' living rooms, Toshiba is offering its players for $399. Most retailers offer a $100 rebate, and Amazon offers the machine for $249 through a special deal with Toshiba. But, Doherty said, Toshiba is losing money whereas Sony is making money on its $499 player. "We should see prices stay steady for some time," Doherty said. "I expect there will be some Black Friday discounts and we'll see some fall products from Sony's competitors. We'll see Samsung, LG, and others come close to Sony, but they aren't able to make their own blue laser diodes so they may have higher costs than Sony." Will the PS3 Follow? Some are speculating about whether the PlayStation 3 will see price drops in the coming weeks. However, most analysts don't expect the PS3 to follow the BDP-300's lead. Sony might be waiting to see what does with its Xbox 360. "We think Microsoft is just about break-even with the Xbox and that Sony is at the break-even point this summer," Doherty said. "The PS3 delivers more in its package, though. If you wanted to get an equivalent to the PS3 on the Xbox side it would cost $670 because you would have to add on the HD DVD drive. So until there's some discounting from Microsoft, we don't except Sony to discount." Envisioneering research shows the PlayStation 3 is selling at a faster rate six months after launch than the PlayStation 2 did. While the PlayStation 3 is often compared to Nintendo's Wii, which is half the price, Doherty said the battle between next-generation consoles is clearly between Sony and Microsoft.

Benjamin Woolley, vP sales & marketing at email and documents management specialist Redmap, speaking to an audience of 55 CIOs and corporate executives at a panel discussion held at the State Library of NSW, warned that few organisations have the processes in place to ensure important documents are not deleted or lost. This will leave organisations, directors and executives vulnerable when it comes time to meet reporting legislation," Woolley said. The worldwide trend is for governments to demand better corporate compliance, governance and risk management. It has spurred the introduction of reporting standards such as Sarbanes-Oxley, IFRS and CLERP 9 that are driving a new generation of electronic archiving, document management and e-audit. Nick Abrahams, Partner at Deacons law firm, who also spoke during the session, outlined electronic record retention and email compliance obligations under Australian law. There are obligations to retain emails for corporate audit and compliance requirements, said Abrahams. Under the Electronic Transactions Act, anything you can do in the off-line world, you can do online. All emails are potential legal obligations or liabilities and can be used as evidence or as part of a legal discovery process. Depending on their content, emails can be regarded as part of an organisations official records. Certain records must be kept for at least five years if they relate to taxes, six years if they relate to industrial relations, and seven years if they relate to areas such as workers compensation or various sections of the Australian Corporations Act, Abrahams said. Woolley also reported a huge surge in demand for new technology to meet privacy, accounting and global reporting requirements in Australia and the United States. Redmap is experiencing explosive growth as we provide systems that ensure email and electronic information is stored and accessible. From vital records to critical business information, Redmap technology helps capture and index electronic documents to strict archival standards. Weve worked for over 10 years in archival technology services for governments, commercial and industrial corporations worldwide, and our latest packages are one of the few to provide everyman access to stringent archival systems in line with the new global requirements. Print joint venture heads towards Ricoh ownership Microsoft does patent deal with Xandros Linux Japan Wiis a lot: 5-to-1 sales over the PS3!

Inside IT - Kevin Railsback ITXtreme with Paul Ryan The Standard's Guest Blog E-Business Solutions & Strategies &laquo; Early look at Microsoft Popfly InfoWorld Daily Podcast &raquo; IDC: Open source market going way up Best of the blogs: The worldwide revenue from standalone open source software hit $1.8 billion last year, according to IDC. What's more, the analyst firm predicts that revenue will soar to $5.8 billion in 2011. "Open source revenues will lag open source adoption. This makes sense because subscription revenues are recognized over the life of a support subscription, and because there's a lot more free use than paid," Matt Asay explains in this Open Sources post . "And [the] future is looking brighter every day." (Disclaimer: IDC is owned by IDG, the parent company of From the Test Center: Microsoft has three major goals for the Orcas beta of Visual Studio. Those are to improve developer productivity, manage application lifecycles through Team Foundation Server and employ the latest technologies. "One major improvement is a new design surface for WPF applications," writes Martin Heller. "I haven't been able to crash Orcas Beta 1 at all." Read the review here. Like most folks, Sean McCown got into his profession primarily by virtue of availability. Rather than becoming an IBM or Oracle DBA, he leaned toward Microsoft products because, "I was in a very small company, and we had SQL Server 6.0 and Windows and Exchange. I also had full access to MSDN and a group of guys who were experts in MS technologies," he explains . It's hardly coincidence, though, and the other side of the coin is that companies who saturate the market with information about their products do much better than those tending to close themselves off. "So all you vendors out there who think you're too good for everybody, just remember this ... if you make it hard enough to learn your product people will stop caring." Malware is not just evolving but, in so doing, is becoming nastier. "When I began fighting hackers and malware in the second half of the 1980s, Apple viruses ruled the land," security guru Roger Grimes harks back. On to the present state of malware. "Good luck and keep your eyes open," he concluded in this installment of Security Adviser . Okay, okay, I'm getting ahead of myself. Grimes delves into a Google paper entitled "The Ghost in the Browser: Analysis of Web-based Malware", and calls it "one of the best reporting papers I've ever read."

http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20070604/sony_shaves_blu_ray_disc_s_prices_by_100-id-104388.html&cid Sony shaves Blu-ray Discâs prices by $100 - The Money Times Advertise on this site Tuesday 05th of June 2007 02:46:56 AM - Loans & Credit - Science & Medicine Bollywood News & Gossip Shopping comparison and reviews Sony shaves Blu-ray Discâs prices by $100 - June 4, 2007 - 0 comments Seems like Sony Corp. is doing quite well and is eager to hook more and more customers by using lower prices as bait. On Monday, the company announced a decrease of $100 in the price tag of new Blu-ray high-definition movie-disc player it is shipping this week. The company held that the BDP-S300 will now be available for $499, instead of the previously announced price of $599. The louring in the price is due to the falling production costs and a boost in demand. The new price tag is almost half the price of the first Blu ray Disc player- BDP-S1, which was launched by Sony on December 4, 2006, and had an exorbitant price of $1000. Although, Sony has shaved the price for its latest Blu-ray Disc player, it still faces a tough completion from its rival Toshiba, which sells their high-definition DVD players for less than $300. Ever since the two giant companies introduced their respective technologies, they have been in cut throat competition with one another. The war between the biggies seems unending as both the formats introduced by them are incompatible. While Sonyâs Blu-ray Disc player has a gigantic memory capacity that makes it extortionately pricey, on the other hand, Toshibaâs HD DVD is an exceptionally well designed extension of accessible technology that is more dewy-eyed and cheaper to introduce. The HD DVD, which provides sharp, wide-screen images, aim at replacing the standard DVD players and the Electronics Association estimate that by the end of 2007, about 1 million players will be sold. However, neither of the two formats has got much acceptance by the customers, who hold that the High-def DVDs come with a high price tag and if one of the formats bites the dust, then consumers may be burdened with worthless equipment. Analyst Gerry Kaufhold at In-Stat/MDR, a technology industry research firm, holds that HD DVD will do great business for four or five years, but by 2009, consumers will jump on the Blu-ray Disc bandwagon. Blu-ray Disc, a high-density optical disc format for the storage of digital media, first wriggled their way to the market shelves when Philips announced their first Blu-ray Disc players in January 2006. Since the time it was introduced, till now, Blu-ray and HD DVD have been at daggers drawn at each other. Hollywood studios are split on the issue, but Blu-ray has the strongest support, with Columbia Pictures, MGM, Disney, Lionsgate and 20th century Fox supporting Blu-ray. Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks, Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema support both the formats. Weinstein Company is the only studio which supports HD DVD.

IT and TELCO JOBS Its official: Steve Jobs to launch iPhone June 29! Its official: Steve Jobs to launch iPhone June 29! Monday, 04 June 2007 So, Steve Jobs was only joking when he told Walt Mossberg the iPhone would probably launch on the last day of June &ndash; he really meant June 29, now 100% confirmed! Its official: Steve Jobs to launch iPhone June 29! Internode hikes ADSL prices for power users - UPDATE Why Apple will sell 10 million iPhones in 2008 Do the new DRM-free tracks have a worm in the Apple? Three cool new Apple iPhone ads have made their US debut on television, showing off how easy, graphically lush, responsible and totally touch controlled the iPhone really is, and trumpeting an actual on sale date of June 29, one day before the end of the month. ads, which can be seen at Apple&rsquo;s website , don&rsquo;t come with the dancing pizzazz seen with Apple iPod ads, but instead feature the iPhone held vertically or horizontally in one hand, while a finger activates actions on the screen, whether it&rsquo;s browsing through music, flicking through coverflow, checking email, answering a phone call, checking the iPhone&rsquo;s maps, typing in information on the virtual keyboard and more. The ads end by saying &ldquo;iPhone&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Only on the new at&t&rdquo; with &ldquo;Use requires 2 year minimum activation plan&rdquo; in smallish print then followed by &ldquo;Coming June 29&rdquo; with the white Apple logo in the center on the screen. Despite the new at&t logo and lowercase writing, the phone itself shows the carrier as &lsquo;AT&T&rsquo; in the top left hand corner. It&rsquo;s visible at different times during the three ads. The old brand &lsquo;Cingular&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t seen anywhere as at&t wipes it from the collective psyche. It&rsquo;s now likely that June will be the most hyped month of pre-iPhone availability ever, as new rumors emerge of as yet unknown features, the possibility that some phone stores will be broken into (as happened with the PS3 and Wii) to get units before general availability, the forming on long days several days before June 29 as consumers try to guarantee themselves an iPhone and try to get some national TV publicity into the bargain and more. Questions also remain over whether Jobs will headline the WWDC with some more iPhone news, information, secret feature surprises or more. Whichever way you look at it, iPhone fever will reach a new level in June, before culminating with its actual launch, and then an avalanche of reviews, user opinions, and, if Apple is true to form, some kind of issue developing that only affects 0.00001% of iPhone users but somehow becomes a huge issue in the press and with consumers, as Apple refuses to comment. All we can do now is to wait and see &ndash; but at least the on sale date is finally with us. June 29 &ndash; the day Apple changes the world again?

Six states&#8217; proposals to mandate [&#8230;] Aligning IT & Business Goals Voice & Data Convergence Sorting through the hype of IT and business coverage Microsoft Lobbies Legislatures to Kill ODF Bills: Time to Tackle The Issue Elsewhere Posted by Ken Hardin on June 4, 2007 at 2:42 pm Microsoft will take a well-deserved beating this week in the wake of a its lobbying efforts derailed states&#8217; legislative efforts to mandate the use of open document standards , as opposed to proprietary formats that have so long been a backbone of Microsoft&#8217;s lucrative productivity suite business. Six states&#8217; proposals to mandate open document standards were met with what one could argue was a distorted wave of enthusiastic coverage in the tech press, but five of those initiatives have been out-and-out killed, with Minnesota&#8217;s measure gelded to a simple admonition from the legislature to study ODF and other open standards as an . I&#8217;d assume a paycheck from the state IT department would imply such basic data management housekeeping, but who am I to say? blogger quickly dubbed Microsoft&#8217;s tactics as and notes that an failed to garner much support from the &#8220;community,&#8221; which of course tends to hate Microsoft. ComputerWorld does a more balanced job in its piece of noting that some big companies, most notably IBM, have more than &#8220;community spirit&#8221; at stake when it comes to tearing down Redmond&#8217;s file type advantage. Still, several letters written to lawmakers in support of Microsoft turned out to be penned by channel partners. Not cool, but not surprising, either. I have been trying to get Microsoft Office to play nicely with non-MS systems for the better part of a decade now, so believe me when I say few people are more irritated with Redmond over this whole ODF thing than I am. Here at IT Business Edge, we still are forced to use a relatively powerful (and expensive) third-party XML converter to prep Word docs for import into our content database. By not writing ODF support into Office programs, Microsoft is trying to hang on to market share at the expense of its essentially locked-in customer base, virtually all of whom work in a heterogeneous environment. But while dishing out harsh words to Microsoft, the tech press probably should reserve scoldings for the open document advocates who decided to tackle this issue from the legislative angle in the first place. The state legislator who sponsored the Minnesota ODF bill told ComputerWorld that lawmakers just found themselves awash in technical jargon. Here&#8217;s the quote you&#8217;ll see quite a bit, I&#8217;m sure: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t know an open document format if it bit me on the butt. We&#8217;re public policy experts. [Deciding technical standards] is not our job.&#8221; Makes you feel better about universal health care, doesn&#8217;t it? The one state, Massachusetts, that has successfully mandated open data standards did so via executive action by the state CIO, who you&#8217;d hope has a more robust view of why it&#8217;s good to be able to get at government data with any number of software packages. A spokesperson for the ODF Alliance tells ComputerWorld that despite the near-term setbacks, his organization expects to make major gains at the state level over the next three years, either legislatively or through . I expect the latter tact to be far more fruitful &#8212; it&#8217;s the same arch that will drive the private sector to ODF, as some shops will want to pay for Office&#8217;s powerful feature set and others will simply want to open memos seamlessly, regardless of which program was used to create them. Microsoft will have to come to terms with the fact that &#8220;bullying&#8221; customers who are being offered a choice is a good way to lose them. feed for comments on this post.

The proposed bills would have required state agencies to use freely available and interoperable file formats, such as the Open Document Format (ODF) for Office Applications, instead of Microsoft Corp.'s proprietary Office formats. The legislation was heavily backed by uses the file format in its Notes 8 software, and , which sells the ODF-compliant But a bill introduced earlier this year met a quick death. And in Florida, Texas and Oregon, would-be laws were all killed off within the past month while being debated in legislative committees, following fierce opposition from Microsoft lobbyists and allies of the software vendor. The most recent defeat occurred last Thursday in California, where a toned-down version of a bill open formats was declared to be stalled in the state assembly's Committee on Appropriations -- even though the bill's sponsor, a Democratic assemblyman for San Francisco, chairs the committee. A spokesman for Leno declined to comment on the fate of the bill, which was in February. But Microsoft also fought the proposal in California The only recent victory for advocates of open formats was a Pyrrhic one.

Brits are Busiest Surfers People in the U.K. spend more time online than the rest of Europe or the U.S., a new study finds. Part 1 of a special five-part series. James Niccolai, IDG News Service Monday, June 04, 2007 9:00 AM PDT Web surfers in the U.K. spend more time online than those in the rest of Europe or the U.S., according to results from a study released on Monday. The average U.K. Internet user spends 34.4 hours on the Web each month -- or almost a day and a half -- followed by the Swedes with 31.7 hours and the Spanish with 30.6 hours, according to the figures, from comScore Inc.'s World Metrix study. The U.K. and Sweden also beat out the U.S., where the average Web surfer spends 31.4 hours online each month, the study found. Asked to explain the U.K.'s high usage rates, Bob Ivins, managing director of comScore Europe, cited an increase in broadband usage and Britain's poor weather. Germany has Europe's biggest Internet population, with 35.6 million people, although Germans spend less time in front of their computers on average, racking up just 22.6 hours online each month. The average for Europe is 24.1 hours per month. The Netherlands has the greatest Internet penetration, at 83 percent, followed by Norway and Sweden with 70 percent each. Russia came last with 11 percent Internet penetration. The figures come with several caveats: They include only Internet users aged 15 and older, and are based on data from 16 of Europe's biggest markets, with the numbers extrapolated to find averages for the rest of the continent. They are based on data collected in April from PCs at home and at work, and do not include Internet access from mobile phones and Internet cafes. On average there were 122 million Europeans online each day in April, compared to 114 million in the U.S., comScore said.

The comScore World Metrix study reveals that the country has the highest average number of daily visitors (21.8 million), the highest usage days per month (21 per user), and the highest average time spent per month per user (34.4 hours). The figures will be welcome news for digital marketers after the IAB UK recorded record spend in online advertising for 2006 and utalkmarketing revealed growth in the area is to continue this year. The study shows, on an average day in April 2007, there were 122 million Europeans aged 15 or older online, versus 114 million in the U.S. The average European accessed the Internet from either a home or a work computer an average of 16.5 days in the month and spent a total of 24 hours viewing 2,662 Web pages. In comparison with our European neighbours, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries have the highest percentage of their populations using the Internet, ranging from 68 percent to 83 percent. Germany has the largest online population: 32.6 million people age 15 and older. Countries that have usage days below the European average are Russia (11.4 average usage days), Austria (12.0), Italy (12.9), Ireland (13.0), Portugal (13.4), Norway (14.7), Denmark (14.7), Switzerland (15.1), Belgium (15.5) and Finland (16.4). The average Swedish user views 4,019 pages per month and views more pages than any other country. This is 51 per cent above the European average of 2,662 pages per month. Managing director of comScore Europe, Bob Ivins, said &ldquo;This marks the first time we have released this detailed of a portrait of Internet usage across the 16 countries, making these comparisons truly revealing. The study also revealed that Google is the most popular property in 13 of the 16 countries, followed by Microsoft in most countries. Yahoo! remains the third most popular property across Europe, despite making the top 3 list in only three countries &ndash; Ireland, Italy and Spain.

According to the federal complaint, Jorge Romero downloaded the TV episodes from one website, and then uploaded then to video-sharing site LiveDigital.com. Fox had served subpoenas to both LiveDigital and YouTube -- where the TV episodes were also uploaded -- seeking the identity of the person who uploaded the videos.

You are not logged in: NASA chief not worried about climate Friday, June 1, 2007 WASHINGTON -- The head of NASA said he was not sure global warming was a problem and added that it would be "arrogant" to assume the world's climate should not change in the future. Scientists called the remarks ignorant. "I have no doubt that global - that a trend of global warming exists," NASA Administrator Michael Griffin said in a taped interview that aired Thursday on National Public Radio. "I am not sure that it is fair to say that is a problem we must wrestle with." "I guess I would ask which human beings, where and when, are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now, is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take," Griffin said. On Wednesday, Griffin's own agency put out a news release about a research paper written by nearly 50 NASA and Columbia University scientists and published in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. The paper shows how "human-made greenhouse gases have brought the Earth's climate close to critical tipping points, with potentially dangerous consequences for the planet." Jerry Mahlman, a former top scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is now at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said Griffin's remarks showed he was either "totally clueless" or "a deep anti-global warming ideologue." James Hansen, a top NASA climate scientist and lead author of the research paper, said Griffin's comments showed "arrogance and ignorance" because millions of people will likely be harmed by global warming in the future. White House science adviser Jack Marburger said he was not disturbed by Griffin's remarks, but distanced them from President Bush, who on Thursday announced an international global warming proposal. "It's pretty obvious that the NASA administrator was speaking about his own personal views and by no means representing or attempting to represent the administration's views or broader policy," Marburger told The Associated Press. "He's got a very wry sense of humor and is very outspoken." Comments are the sole responsibility of the person posting them.

Benjamin Woolley, vP sales & marketing at email and documents management specialist Redmap, speaking to an audience of 55 CIOs and corporate executives at a panel discussion held at the State Library of NSW, warned that few organisations have the processes in place to ensure important documents are not deleted or lost. This will leave organisations, directors and executives vulnerable when it comes time to meet reporting legislation," Woolley said. The worldwide trend is for governments to demand better corporate compliance, governance and risk management. It has spurred the introduction of reporting standards such as Sarbanes-Oxley, IFRS and CLERP 9 that are driving a new generation of electronic archiving, document management and e-audit. Nick Abrahams, Partner at Deacons law firm, who also spoke during the session, outlined electronic record retention and email compliance obligations under Australian law. There are obligations to retain emails for corporate audit and compliance requirements, said Abrahams. Under the Electronic Transactions Act, anything you can do in the off-line world, you can do online. All emails are potential legal obligations or liabilities and can be used as evidence or as part of a legal discovery process. Depending on their content, emails can be regarded as part of an organisations official records. Certain records must be kept for at least five years if they relate to taxes, six years if they relate to industrial relations, and seven years if they relate to areas such as workers compensation or various sections of the Australian Corporations Act, Abrahams said. Woolley also reported a huge surge in demand for new technology to meet privacy, accounting and global reporting requirements in Australia and the United States. Redmap is experiencing explosive growth as we provide systems that ensure email and electronic information is stored and accessible. From vital records to critical business information, Redmap technology helps capture and index electronic documents to strict archival standards. Weve worked for over 10 years in archival technology services for governments, commercial and industrial corporations worldwide, and our latest packages are one of the few to provide everyman access to stringent archival systems in line with the new global requirements. Print joint venture heads towards Ricoh ownership Microsoft does patent deal with Xandros Linux Japan Wiis a lot: 5-to-1 sales over the PS3!

Meet online instead - it's easy! GoToMeeting starts in seconds Try it FREE today. IDC: Open Source a $6B Industry by 2011 June 4, 2007 12:13PM One significant finding in IDC's study of open-source software is that revenues for open-source software companies will lag behind the adoption of the software itself. A significant portion of open-source software is free, while paid distributions typically derive revenue from ongoing subscriptions rather than up-front purchases. China Unveils New Global Warming Plan Bald Eagle Coming Off Endangered List? Liver Cancer Breakthrough Found Wildlife Watchdog Eyes Trade Limits Death Toll from Katrina Rising with HP's All-in-One Storage Systems. Simple and affordable ways to set I.T. free. A new report by IDC concludes that stand-alone, open-source software is poised to become a $5.8 billion industry by 2011, up from $1.8 billion in 2006. That represents a compound annual growth rate of 26 percent over that time period, and, according to IDC, it might go higher. "We are in the early stages of the development and deployment of OSS," Matt Lawton, program director of IDC's Open Source Software Business Models research program, said in press statement. "The market is still quite immature, especially now that we see active open-source projects in all layers of the software stack." The IDC report identifies several reasons for the increase, including increased interest in open-source software as a tool for negotiating with proprietary software vendors, more financial backing of open source by venture capitalists, increased comfort with a subscription-payment model, and a rising interest in open-source software in general. In a telephone interview, Lawton said that, despite the impressive growth in open-source software adoption, it still represents a tiny fraction of the worldwide software industry. One significant finding in the IDC study, Lawton said, is that revenues for open-source software companies will lag behind the adoption of the software itself. A significant portion of open-source software is free, while paid distributions typically derive revenue from ongoing subscriptions rather than up-front purchases. "Some of the barriers that have prevented customers from paying for open source are coming down," Lawton suggested. "There were concerns about the availability of support, but vendors are starting to offer professional support. There also has been a lot of publicity around the risk of infringement of patented software. We found that it is an issue, but not a huge one for customers. Also, vendors are getting more comfortable with getting revenue from open source." Overall, Lawton said, customers are realizing that the quality of open-source software is often quite high, and there is a lot that is commercial-grade. The steadily improving quality of open-source software, the increased availability of reliable support, and the projected growth in revenues are all helping to make proprietary software companies nervous. "Open-source software has two impacts on proprietary-software companies," Lawton said. "It helps open up new markets, where we're seeing a growth in software adoption and revenue generated. And as adoption rates increase, open-sources software also eats into the revenues of proprietary-software companies in existing markets."

Apple won't say why it brands songs with buyer info, but it may simply be a tactic to thwart illicit file-sharers. Retailers Use M-Commerce to Grow Sales Retailers are growing their sales and improving customer loyalty with branded m-commerce sites. Download a : "What Retailers Should Know about M-Commerce" to learn more. Digital music lovers had only just begun to do their happy dance Wednesday following launch of its iTunes Plus DRM-free service before word came that the dream of DRM-free music may come with a price in addition to the extra 30 cents per track iTunes charges. Shortly after the iTunes Plus service went live, reports surfaced asserting that the tracks had been embedded with the purchasers' full names and the e-mail addresses associated with their iTunes accounts, all included in song information files that come bundled with each track. The identifying content was also reportedly found in copyright-protected tracks purchased from the regular iTunes site. The revelation has many digital audiophiles wondering if they have traded one form of restriction for another, more insidious version. Apple on Wednesday loudly heralded the arrival of digitally unlocked files to its iTunes Plus Music Store. In launching the new service, the company made good on January statements by CEO Steve Jobs calling on the music industry to end the practice of encoding digital rights management (DRM) technology into music files purchased online. Apple itself uses a form of DRM, known as "FairPlay," in normal music files sold on iTunes. FairPlay limits iTunes-sold songs' playability to only Apple-branded portable media devices. Wednesday marked the first non-DRM files sold through the store. The move was lauded despite the 30 percent price increase that came with the DRM-free tunes. The discovery of the personal information, however, has sparked a controversy, as it is not clear why Apple has included personally identifying information on all of the songs it sells or what the information could be used for. Some reports postulate that the information could be used as an antipiracy measure to help record labels identify who posted what songs to a given peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing network. However, since the information is also included on tracks with DRM, it could be a function of Apple's administrative or record-keeping system. Apple did not reply to MacNewsWorld's requests for comment. Do the Right Thing "We should be clear on one thing: Just because EMI and Apple -- and more to come -- have removed DRM from their files does not mean those files can be shared," James McQuivey, a Any digital music lovers who feel cheated because they bought a DRM-free piece of music from Apple only to find that Apple assigns ownership of that track to them -- and them only -- have missed the point of DRM-free music, McQuivey explained. "The goal is to make [the songs] easier to use, not easy to steal. Being upset that a product you bought for yourself is traceable to you is a little clueless," he said. Apple is well within its right to include the identifying information because the company has an interest in making sure users do not copy the music, McQuivey pointed out. iTunes customers must consent to a users agreement when purchasing tracks from the site. "Your privacy is only compromised if you choose to redistribute the track -- something you don't have the right to do anyway. Apple could have used an encrypted account number to hide this tracking. The fact that they didn't suggests they are being anything but big brother about protecting their legal rights," he added. Sorry, No Free Lunch "Is it any different than a property tag you might put on a CD?" asked analyst Mike McGuire, who told MacNewsWorld that he is at a loss to understand what the problem is "unless you're embarrassed that you like Twisted Sister and someone might notice that." It could be the case that other purveyors of digital music files, including and soon-to-be music retailer , also embed personal information in tracks they sell, McGuire pointed out. "This is part and parcel of the way things have to work these days," he asserted. "I'm not defending Apple, but in terms of the notion that they have convinced at least one of the major labels not to put DRM on these files, and how different is that from me looking in the window of your car and seeing a receipt from the CD store?" Users who post the songs on P2P networks, he said, could find themselves receiving more spam , but added that he does not see any added risk beyond that. "Frankly, I would say the risk is relatively minimal," he stated. "We frequently expose that and other kinds of information when we use things like ATMs. "If you're a music person who puts things online, the benefit you get from no DRM is that you can put that out there on the Web. You can probably find somebody that will strip that information off the files for you. So it's not as if this is impending the use of [music files], which has been what the big resistance people have had to DRM," he explained. "So, as always, there is no free lunch here," McGuire concluded.

Sony slashes 0 off Blu-ray players; is PS3 next? Gearbox dribbles out info on Aliens shooter More rumours quashed, no Gears of War for PS3 Wii-mote can digitise human speech PS3: Rumours of its death have been greatly exaggerated Days after the latest draft of the GPLv3 that was released, seemingly giving the all-clear to the Microsoft/Novell deal but wanting to prevent further such deals from arising, Microsoft and Xandros seem to have ignored it with their announcement of a 5 year deal. Microsoft said that they, and Xandros , had announced a &ldquo;broad collaboration agreement based on a set of technical, business, marketing and intellectual property commitments&rdquo;. Just as with the Novell deal, Microsoft says customers will get &ldquo;enhanced interoperability, more effective systems management solutions, and intellectual property assurances, all of which extend a bridge between open source and commercial software and deliver customers real value in mixed systems environments&rdquo;. Andreas Typaldos, the CEO of Xandros said in a statement that: &ldquo;Companies today are running a mixture of Linux and Windows systems. Cross-platform data centers are a reality. To meet evolving customer needs, vendors need to recognize the value of sharing intellectual property, developing more interoperable solutions, and providing management tools that are familiar and easy to use.&rdquo; Quite what Novell thinks about the deal is as yet unknown, but Microsoft paints it in a long line of collaborations with &ldquo;Linux platform and open source software providers&rdquo;. Microsoft points to Novell, JBoss, XenSource, Samsung, Zend and others. Bill Hilf, the GM of Platform Strategy at Microsoft said that &ldquo;Customers win when their platform providers build collaborative relationships. We have been working with commercial open source companies to deliver better value to our customers in areas like server interoperability, systems management and office document formats. We believe in and encourage respect for all licensing and development models, and intellectual property is an important component in this environment. Our announcement with Xandros is an exciting step to deliver what our mutual customers have been asking for.&rdquo; The deal covers systems management interoperability, server operability, office document compatibility, the all important intellectual property assurance, with a promise from Microsoft not to sue Xandros customers and also Microsoft sales and marketing support, all as with Novell, although there is no mention of Microsoft buying Xandros coupons as they did when the Microsoft/Novell deal included Microsoft buying millions of dollars worth of vouchers to redistribute and sell to Microsoft&rsquo;s existing customers.

A similar bill in was changed to study the issue instead. There was heavy lobbying being done in private on both sides with one problem being 'the jargon-laden disinformation that committee members felt they were being fed by lobbyists for both IBM and Microsoft. Although lobbyists would tell the committee one thing in private, they got cold feet when asked to verify the information publicly, under oath.' However, 'Despite the string of defeats, Marino Marcich, executive director of the Washington-based ODF Alliance, said the legislative fight has only begun.'" Microsoft's 'Men in Black' Kill Florida Open Standards Legislation A NewsForge article was handed to us talking about pressure Microsoft recently brought to bear on a piece of Florida legislation. A few short paragraphs in Senate bill 1974 added by Rep. Ed Homan discussed the need for open data formats, but Microsoft's men in black responded by pressuring legislators and staff employees about the bill's language. "A legislative staff employee who would lose his job if he were quoted here by name said, 'By the time those lobbyists were done talking, it sounded like ODF (Open Document Format, the free and open format used by OpenOffice.org and other free software) was proprietary and the Microsoft format was the open and free one.' Two other legislative employees (who must also remain anonymous) told Linux.com that the Microsoft lobbyists implied that elected representatives who voted against Microsoft's interests might have a little more trouble raising campaign funds than they would if they helped the IT giant achieve its Florida goals. Note that lobbyists for IBM, Sun Microsystems, and Novell -- the only three companies with a major interest in open source who have registered lobbyists in Florida -- did not weigh in on this matter."

Other likely formats would be Adobe Acrobat, at least for read only files.

Based on what's mentioned in the article and notes from the hearing [state.tx.us], it does appear to be dead (until at least 2009 when the issue can be brought up again). Mathers is chief clerk for the Committee on Government Reform in the Texas House of Representatives and is in charge of researching bills for the committee, which considered and eventually quashed HB1794. "The committee," he said, "wanted a flat-out answer from the DIR. 'Was [moving to open document formats] something we should be doing right now? And did they need the backing of the committee to do it?' The answer in both cases was, 'No.'" The article goes on to mention a number of additional factors including the animosity and FUD coming from both Microsoft and IBM lobbyists that undermined the credibility of each side as well as the unwillingness of either side to testify publicly. It's also mentioned that Representative "Veasey blames other factors; for example, he claimed that the reform committee has a historical bias against government mandates. He also cited Microsoft's tactics. According to Veasey, the software vendor cooperated with him on initial drafts of the bill but then refused to sign off at the last moment. He said said Microsoft also hired a top local lobbying firm that went to the expense of bringing in witnesses from other states and countries." That's not to say you shouldn't write your local Texas Rep if you support either Microsoft's or IBM's position, but for now, the bill has been "quashed".

"Each electronic document created, exchanged, or maintained by a state agency must be created, exchanged, or maintained in an open, Extensible Markup Language based file format" While some may interpret "electronic document" to mean only word processing documents and spreadsheet documents it may be that other things such as emails, database entries, and many, many other state records kept electronically could also be considered "electronic documents" and thus fall under the requirement to be "created, exchanged, or maintained in an open, Extensible Markup Language based file format." If this is the case then it greatly increases the scope of the bill from being a simple switch from MS Office to OpenOffice to a massive effort involving the definition of many new XML schemata, developing, testing and debugging software to handle the new schemata, creation of documentation, deployment of and training for the new software, etc., etc. Things like tax records, court records, police records and so forth, and databases comprised thereof cannot be automagically converted from their current electronic formats into open XML formats in the twinkling of an eye by snapping your fingers.

For example, I just did a contract job where I had to upgrade a company's three computers (ha). The contract specified Vista because it's new (and shiny!). I built the three computers and had them up, runnning and networked in about 20 hours. I deployed them to the company and spent 30 hours just training the two users how to find things in Vista and how to run it. I think the g'ment would rather just continue to throw money at MS rather than have the techs complaining that they're being overburdened with stupid questions and the secretaries being overburdened with "I don't know how to use this".

For example, I use Microsoft Office as a full document processing system. I depend on either Office Document Imaging or third party commerical OCR plugins to perform a tremendous part of my work. Microsoft makes a full developer API as well as extensive developer documentation available to me with easily obtainable support from a centralized source. I regularly receive files that are 10-25 years old in document formats that either I'd have to reverse engineer or heavily research to read when Word and Excel read them just fine and give me all the APIs I need to access them. So, now seeing a nearly relgious style movement to try and force governments to use a different file format seemed a bit confusing to me. I tried the ODF support system for Word, it's not bad, but where's the support for Excel and such? Am I just missing it? Now on the other hand, I exported documents as Word 2003 files and Open Office seemed to open them just fine. When I added scripting this appeared to be an issue, but from what I can tell, it doesn't work with ODF either, so there's still no benefit to ODF for me. When I open both formats for the same document in a text editor, fact is, and I'm no stranger to XML, I feel that Office XML is a bit messier, but since it's really meant more to be a machine readable format, I don't see this being a big issue. Both document formats were clear enough. I won't make a huge check list, but I did feel that Office XML made less assumptions and therefore was more informative. So why would I want or need ODF if OpenOffice supports Word just fine. I used AbiWord instead of Microsoft Word for 2 years with no problems with The last time I actually noticed that I was having file compatibility problems with office packages is back in the days when I was diehard WordPerfect and .DOC support was just too limited at the time. Since then, when I experienced problems importing Word files into StarOffice, OpenOffice, SuperOffice, I just blamed it on poor quality software which was in fact the case at the time. Now that OpenOffice is beginning to feel like a professionally written program, I notice it less and less. The way I see it is, it has to work both ways. Microsoft has released documentation to the Office document formats and OpenOffice.org is doing a great job of getting it working. The ODF import filter for Office seems to be coming along nicely, but still has a way to go, I'm assuming it's mostly an issue of trying to map features from one office format to another. Also, before I conclude, last I checked, I still have support for importing WordPerfect 5.1 document in Office. So, so far as I can tell, there's really little difference between ODF and Office formats, I would expect that for at least the next 20 years, OpenOffice.org would strive to support today's Word document format. I would also hope that for the next 20 years, developers are working to support the ODF format in each new version of Office. I'd also imagine that most other office packages would work towards supporting both and by reading source to OpenOffice could learn how better to support Microsoft formats. So as a conclusion, is there in fact a need for forcing ODF over Office when in reality, cross-integration should be the key. P.S. - Wouldn't time be better spent bullying governments into insisting that ODF support is shipped as standard with Office and made available as a critical office update through Windows Update? This would at least help support for the format propagate. P.P.S. - Why not reroute some of the lobbying finances towards development of a small lightweight, cross-platform, ODF/Office viewer control so that applications like Office or OpenOffice wouldn't be required to read the contents of e Read the rest of this comment... by fuliginous (Score:2) Monday June 04, @08:15AM by kimvette (Score:2) Monday June 04, @09:34AM So Continue with MS-Office... by Wooky_linuxer (Score:2) Monday June 04, @09:50AM So many mistakes in parent post . . . by walterbyrd (Score:2) Monday June 04, @10:54AM What's the big deal? on Monday June 04, @11:33AM ( I guess if ODF is required by law to be used for government documents, it really doesn't mean a lot since all office suites can (will be able to) read/write it.

The fact that it's "open" doesn't mean it isn't fundamentally broken. Well I don't agree. Perhaps you can specify a few reasons why you think it is fundamentally broken? I really don't know if ODF is the best open office-document standard that we could ever develop (probably not) but it is certainly very good at doing its job so far. And I mean that it does both the "office-document" part and the "open" part. With regard to being a good "office-document" standard, it seems to support all the features a user would expect from a modern format. With regard to the "open" part, I recently discovered that you can extract all the data from an ODF spreadsheet using a few lines of python (unzipping and using mindom to parse it), which allows me to write scripts to extract data from spreadsheets, perform more sophisticated analysis (that no spreadsheet could handle), and dump the results back into the document. Needless to say, that would have been impossible using a proprietary, binary, non-human-readable format. So, again, I wonder whether you can refer me to an objectively better format (that currently exists). Right now, in terms of office documents, I would argue that ODF is the format, because it is open, it has all the required features, and it exists. Proprietary formats are broken as long as it remains proprietary (it is, in fact, defective by design).

OOXML was designed to basically be an XML dump of MS Office documents, and from what I have heard (and seen), it's little more than a straight 1:1 conversion of the binary Office format into XML. I suggest you go actually try to read the OOXML "open standard", and understand why it is neither. It has little to do with the 6000 pages, it's about how little is actually in that 6000 page document. Now, you can complain (not without significant justification) that OOXML is a hugely bloated standard No. We complain that it is not a standard, and not suitable for implementation in anything but MS Office. due to it's trying to be all things to all iterations of Office The problem is not that it supports all these various iterations of Office, and even older things (WordPerfect, etc). The problem is that they support these by creating some sort of tag or attribute or something which flags a section as being formatted for Word95 or somesuch, and then don't define how to do that. They basically say it's "beyond the scope of this document", and that you should emulate the behavior of the software in question. And this is not the right way to design a standard format anyway. Suppose different versions of Word came with different default heading styles. You could just put tags around something -- or you could use a format that supports defining custom styles. but your comment that only MS can use MS formats is a red-herring. That's true, we can reverse-engineer MS formats, and have done so. Most open office suites (OpenOffice, KOffice, AbiWord, etc) support the binary Office formats quite well. But it's still reverse-engineered, and still not complete. It would be entirely possible to make a document standard that is just as flexible, concise, and transparent as ODF, but support all of the crap that OOXML does. The difference is, it would be much more difficult for MS to support such a standard, and much easier for everyone else. As it is, OOXML is much easier for Microsoft to implement than for anyone else. Consider that, in order to fully support OOXML, you have to actually go and buy all of those different versions of Office, plus random crap like WordPerfect, and reverse-engineer their behavior. So OOXML is not any better than the binary formats, because in reality, you may actually have to reverse-engineer MORE products in order to make it work.

Shortly after the iTunes Plus service went live, reports surfaced asserting that the tracks had been embedded with the purchasers' full names and the e-mail addresses associated with their iTunes accounts, all included in song information files that come bundled with each track. The identifying content was also reportedly found in copyright-protected tracks purchased from the regular iTunes site. The revelation has many digital audiophiles wondering if they have traded one form of restriction for another, more insidious version. Apple on Wednesday loudly heralded the arrival of digitally unlocked files to its iTunes Plus Music Store. In launching the new service, the company made good on January statements by CEO Steve Jobs calling on the music industry to end the practice of encoding digital rights management (DRM) technology into music files purchased online. Apple itself uses a form of DRM, known as "FairPlay," in normal music files sold on iTunes. FairPlay limits iTunes-sold songs' playability to only Apple-branded portable media devices. Wednesday marked the first non-DRM files sold through the store. The move was lauded despite the 30 percent price increase that came with the DRM-free tunes. The discovery of the personal information, however, has sparked a controversy, as it is not clear why Apple has included personally identifying information on all of the songs it sells or what the information could be used for. Some reports postulate that the information could be used as an antipiracy measure to help record labels identify who posted what songs to a given peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing network. However, since the information is also included on tracks with DRM, it could be a function of Apple's administrative or record-keeping system. Apple did not reply to MacNewsWorld's requests for comment. Do the Right Thing "We should be clear on one thing: Just because EMI and Apple -- and more to come -- have removed DRM from their files does not mean those files can be shared," James McQuivey, a Any digital music lovers who feel cheated because they bought a DRM-free piece of music from Apple only to find that Apple assigns ownership of that track to them -- and them only -- have missed the point of DRM-free music, McQuivey explained. "The goal is to make [the songs] easier to use, not easy to steal. Being upset that a product you bought for yourself is traceable to you is a little clueless," he said. Apple is well within its right to include the identifying information because the company has an interest in making sure users do not copy the music, McQuivey pointed out. iTunes customers must consent to a users agreement when purchasing tracks from the site. "Your privacy is only compromised if you choose to redistribute the track -- something you don't have the right to do anyway. Apple could have used an encrypted account number to hide this tracking. The fact that they didn't suggests they are being anything but big brother about protecting their legal rights," he added. Sorry, No Free Lunch "Is it any different than a property tag you might put on a CD?" asked analyst Mike McGuire, who told MacNewsWorld that he is at a loss to understand what the problem is "unless you're embarrassed that you like Twisted Sister and someone might notice that." It could be the case that other purveyors of digital music files, including and soon-to-be music retailer , also embed personal information in tracks they sell, McGuire pointed out. "This is part and parcel of the way things have to work these days," he asserted. "I'm not defending Apple, but in terms of the notion that they have convinced at least one of the major labels not to put DRM on these files, and how different is that from me looking in the window of your car and seeing a receipt from the CD store?" Users who post the songs on P2P networks, he said, could find themselves receiving more spam , but added that he does not see any added risk beyond that. "Frankly, I would say the risk is relatively minimal," he stated. "We frequently expose that and other kinds of information when we use things like ATMs. "If you're a music person who puts things online, the benefit you get from no DRM is that you can put that out there on the Web. You can probably find somebody that will strip that information off the files for you. So it's not as if this is impending the use of [music files], which has been what the big resistance people have had to DRM," he explained. "So, as always, there is no free lunch here," McGuire concluded.

The news was conveyed in three television ads that featured lots of iPhone eye candy, with close-up images of the device's Web surfing, video playback and photo browsing capabilities. TeraCloud's "Free" Storage Resource Management Tool Eliminate hours of manual reporting and optimize your storage environment with an easy-to-use solution. Try TeraCloud's FREE Storage Resource Management (SRM) tool, TSF EXPRESS for Windows, Linux, Solaris, and AIX. The date for the much-anticipated iPhone launch has been set for June 29. tipped the date Sunday with a trio of new television ads, which are also available for viewing on its Web site. If soon-to-be iPhone owners have been antsy for news of the June release date, there's a good chance they'll start drooling when they see the new ads, which feature close-up views of the iPhone playing high-quality video, surfing the Web, browsing through album covers, family photos, and a seafood restaurant search that shows off results on a handy street map. "The iPhones will be on sale in company-owned resale stores, and they'll be available in Apple retail stores as well as on their online store," John Kampfe, a spokesperson for AT&T, told MacNewsWorld. Apple confirmed the date but declined to comment on details. The iPhone will only be available via AT&T (formerly Cingular) service plans, and as Apple's iPhone video ads note, the use of the iPhone will require a minimum two-year activation plan. Apple may launch the iPhone with a special event rather than during regular events at which it has kicked off new products in the past, such as its Worldwide Developers Conference, going on next week in San Francisco. Will Apple and AT&T launch some pre-Fourth of July weekend fireworks? "We're not disclosing any other plans at this point beyond what we've said already," Kampfe noted. However, Apple already milked a great deal of hype when it unveiled the iPhone back in January at Macworld. A second event might be overkill. "To be honest, I don't think they need to do a whole lot to drive additional attention. There's a lot of hunger around this already," Charles Golvin, a principal analyst with Apple and AT&T may hold a launch event at the Apple Store in New York to help drive mass media coverage, Golvin noted. They may also let the iPhone go on sale at midnight the night before, he speculated. "I still see two waves of uptake, and the first is the Apple fan boys, the people who are devoted to all things Apple ... and there are plenty of them," Golvin explained. These Apple customers have been paying careful attention to their cellular service contracts and have been making sure they are off of competitors' contracts in advance of the iPhone launch. "The more interesting piece will be the second wave, those who are very interested, who maybe already have a BlackJack or Motorola Q -- or something in the same space that's more consumer-friendly than a BlackBerry," Golvin noted. "We'll see if they're still willing pay the premium [for an iPhone]." The iPhone will initially come in two versions -- a 4 GB model for US$499 and an 8 GB model for $599. The steep price tag could put quite a heavy burden on sales ; however, when adding the price of a new iPod to that of a cell phone, the total could be close enough to justify the expense to some consumers. After the initial wave of sales to Apple aficionados, the price may well hold strong. "There's so much attention paid on the price point, but if you go back to the initial price of the Motorola Razr, when also had an exclusive on it, it was $499, so this is not the first phone to be priced at this level," Golvin explained. "And they were able to hold that price point for quite a while." Next Article in iPhone: You've Got to Hide Your iPhone Away More by Chris Maxcer ListManager software is robust, scalable, integrated.

Microsoft on Friday added copyrighted books to its online library, saying it has permission to offer the works to searchers on the Internet. By making deals with authors and publishing houses to include their works in the Live Search Books index Microsoft sidesteps a controversy triggered by Google's plan to offer the world's written works online. "We have paid particular attention to ensuring that we are only including books in our index that our publishing partners have given us permission to include," Live Search program manager Betsy Aoki said in a posting on the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant's website. "So our customers and partners can feel secure in our stance on copyright protection." Listed among the publishers adding their books to Microsoft's virtual shelves are Cambridge University Press, McGraw-Hill Companies, Rodale and Simon and Schuster. Searchers can read books online or follow links to websites where they can buy them. Google launched its book project in 2004 aiming to scan all literary works and post them online. The Mountain View, California-based company has stored on its searchable database classic works in the public domain, along with copyrighted books submitted with or without the publishers' permission. After outcries from publishing houses and authors, Google modified its online library to offer only summaries of copyrighted works along with information regarding where to buy or borrow the books. » Next Article in Technology - Internet: Google Hits the Streets, Raises Concerns would you recommend this story? out of 5 after 7 total votes You need to be registered at PhysOrgForum to add your comments.

Career Tips and Tricks: In Ataris Bullet Witch for the Microsoft Xbox 360, you play as Alicia Claus, a beautiful witch who wields a huge gun-rod, a kind of broom-shaped weapon that can be upgraded over time. (Gannett News Service/Atari/File) Posted June 3, 2007 'Bullet Witch' casts fun but flawed spell What's a video gamer to do while waiting for blockbuster titles such as "Madden NFL 08" (Aug. 14), "Halo 3" (Sept. 25) and "Grand Theft Auto IV" (Oct. 16)? The answer is to rent some games for the weekend, such as Atari's "Bullet Witch," a slightly above-average sci-fi shooter for the Microsoft Xbox 360. This third-person shooter takes place in the year 2013, after our planet has suffered fatalities in the billions because of natural disasters, war and infectious diseases. As if this weren't enough, an inter-dimensional portal opened up, allowing demons to seep through and attack those few people remaining. This is where you come in. You play as Alicia Claus, a beautiful witch who is as powerful with her magic spells as she is deft with a trigger finger. She wields a huge "gun-rod," a kind of broom-shaped weapon that can be upgraded over time. But gun battles with hoards of demons get tiring after a while. For one, while some might hide for cover, the not-so-bright creatures basically stand there and let you shoot them down one by one. Another issue is that the action sequences repeat each other often, which works something like this: fight baddies, move ahead and watch a short story sequence, then fight more baddies and move ahead toward the end of the level. You start with the gun-rod as a machine gun, but in time it can be switched to a shotgun, sniper rifle and Gatling gun. Magic spells, however, produce a more exhilarating effect than the predictable gunplay. Pressing the left or right shoulder button brings up a magic wheel, whereby you can spin and select what kind of magic spell to invoke  if you've earned enough skill points to unlock it. Highlights include "Willpower," which creates a shock wave that sends nearby objects hurling toward enemies, and "Lightning," where Alicia summons a bolt that kills the enemy instantly. Visually speaking, the effects of these spells (and others, including summoning a meteor shower) are quite gratifying. It's too bad the huge and detailed environments in "Bullet Witch," such as accurately modeled suburban neighborhoods, are as linear as they are. That is, you're given the impression you can go anywhere and do anything  as in "Grand Theft Auto"  but you soon realize you're on a short leash and must follow a specific path. Another problem with the game is that it can be cumbersome to control Alicia's movement with the Xbox 360's left analog stick while moving the camera with the right analog stick. It's like having to play actor and director at the same time, which might work for some games (usually when the camera is somewhat automated, but lets you swivel it around for a better view) but not when both are continuously mandatory, as in "Bullet Witch." This single-player adventure has its strengths  namely, big and attractive outdoor environments and impressive spell casting effects  but dumb artificial intelligence, repetitive gun battles and awkward controls bring the game down to a C-grade experience. And at only six or seven hours of play, you can easily tackle this single-player shooter in a weekend. But if you need to get your action fix while waiting for this year's more eagerly anticipated video games, you could do worse than "Bullet Witch."

As President Bush heads to a summit of industrial nations in Germany with a new initiative to reduce the greenhouse gases blamed for climate change, his administration is cutting back on efforts to measure the impact of the warming trend. The problem is a costly and problem-plagued satellite system. Because of technology glitches and a near-doubling of its original $6.5 billion cost, the Defense Department has decided to downsize and launch four satellites paired into two orbits, instead of six satellites and three orbits. The satellites were intended to gather weather and climate data and replace existing satellites as they come to the end of their useful lifetimes, beginning in 2010. The reduced system of four satellites will now focus on weather forecasting. Most of the climate instruments needed to collect more precise data over long periods are being eliminated. Instead, the Pentagon and its two partners - the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA - will rely on European satellites for most of the climate data. U.S. scientists worry they won't provide the data needed. ''Unfortunately, the recent loss of climate sensors ... places the overall climate program in serious jeopardy,'' NOAA and NASA scientists told the White House in a confidential December 11 report obtained by The Associated Press. They said they will face major gaps in data collectible only from satellites about ice caps and sheets, surface levels of seas and lakes, sizes of glaciers, surface radiation, water vapor, snow cover and even atmospheric carbon dioxide.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/9-3&fd=R&url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7007539705&cid=1116967459&ei=h4BkRvOzHJGoqwPdn5maBg AHN | Apple Announces U.S. Launch-Date For iPhone - June 29 | June 4, 2007 global news for the digital world Apple Announces U.S. Launch-Date For iPhone - June 29 June 4, 2007 8:35 a.m. EST Jacob Cherian - AHN News Writer Cupertino, CA (AHN) - Apple has finally revealed its much-anticipated launch date for its revolutionary iPhone. The date will be June 29 in the U.S. A release date for Europe and for other parts of the world has yet to be determined. That date was broadcast on a number of TV ads on Sunday, and later confirmed by Apple. The ads also mentioned that the phone will be available "only on the new AT&T," BBC news reported. Depending on the favored configuration, the iPhone will sell of $499 or $599. The device is presumably more advanced than other smart-phones and is described as a cell phone plus a personal digital assistant. As a matter of fact, Apple CEO Steve Jobs supposedly can't leave home without it. He said that he was carrying his iPhone on him during last week's "public conversation" with friend and rival Bill Gates of Microsoft at the D5: All Things Digital Conference in California. The most impressive feature that the device touts is its touch screen-interface. And this is likely to pave the way for more smart-phones to add on this feature, say experts. Just last week, a computer in a coffee table design that uses touch screen-interface was outed by Microsoft, called "Surface." Some of the functions on the iPhone include surfing the Net, watching videos and going through your email using your finger as a pointer. Apple is hoping the iPhone' s compatibility with iTunes music and video store will appeal to its customers, who are already hooked to the iPod. The Cupertino, California-based firm is also attempting to enter the mobile phone market, which is far more lucrative than the MP3 market. The iPhone's release has been long-awaited by Apple watchers since its announcement in January at the San Francisco MacWorld, stealing the limelight from the Consumers Electronics Show, held simultaneously in Las Vegas.

The chosen game isn&#8217;t perhaps the greatest of them all, but 100 games in six months or so isn&#8217;t bad going at all!. Before we give you the low down on this week&#8217;s entries, here&#8217;s what George Harrison, Nintendo of Americaâs senior vice president of marketing and corporate communications, had to say about the achievement: âWith an Internet connection rate reaching 40 percent, Wii owners have more options than ever to find the kinds of games they love to play. Beyond the Wii Shop Channel, all types of people are getting connected and checking out the information and entertainment options available on the Wii Menu. Whether voting, creating a Mii or just checking the weather, everyone has a favorite channel.â Milon&#8217;s Secret Castle is an action-adventure game released by Hudson Soft for the Nintendo Famicom (Japan) on November 13, 1986, the Nintendo Entertainment System (USA) in September, 1988, and the Game Boy on March 26, 1993. Although quirky, the title has generally been considered extremely difficult and frustrating. There are no save points, and once a player runs out of life, the game is over. However, it is possible to continue, after obtaining the first crystal. Purchase at your peril! Â® (NESÂ®, 1 player, Rated E for Everyone - Comic Mischief, 500 Wii Points): &#8220;It is a world where music is the language of the people. An evil warlord from the north arrives and captures the castle. The princess is imprisoned deep within the castle, and the worldâs musical instruments are taken and hidden away. Our hero, Milon, takes it upon himself to fight the warlord, rescue the princess and recover the peopleâs musical instruments. He has only his wits and the magical Bubble to aid him on his quest. Help Milon along the way by looking for hidden doors, finding secret items and defeating fierce enemies. Make sure to look for the shops inside the castle, where you can buy hints and valuable items. Whenever Milon finds a Music Box, he will be transported to a bonus stage. Each instrument you find will add a layer to the background music. Try to grab all seven instruments to create a performance worthy of a music-themed game.&#8221; In contrast to the original ToeJam and Earl, Planet in Funkotron takes the form of a side-scrolling platformer. Collecting humans in jars is the name of the game, better explained by Nintendoâs very own blurb below. Expect the same kind of âwackyâ and âzanyâ behaviour as that in its prequel. ToeJam &#038; Earlâ¢ in Panic on Funkotron (Sega Genesis, 1-2 players, Rated E for Everyone - Comic Mischief, 800 Wii Points): &#8220;During ToeJam and Earlâs trip back home, a number of Earthlings hitchhiked on their spaceship and are now infesting planet Funkotron. ToeJam and Earl must track down the Earthlings in order to capture them in large jars and ship them back to Earth in spaceships. It is also their funky mission to find 10 beloved objects belonging to Lamont the âFunkapotamus,â the source of all funk in the universe, so they can persuade him to return to his favorite funk-filled planet. ToeJam and Earl must use their âfunk powers,â such as Funk Move and Funk Scan, to assist in evading and capturing the Earthlings.&#8221; Well done Virtual Console! Dead Moon is a video game released for the TurboGrafx-16. It was developed and published by Natsume Inc. and released on February 22, 1991 in Japan and later in 1991 in the United States. It is a side scrolling action shooter with the player piloting a space ship in order to stop an alien infestation of the Moon. The game starts out on Earth but then sends the player into outer space to combat the attack. (TurboGrafx16, 1 player, Rated E for Everyone - Mild Fantasy Violence, 600 Wii Points): &#8220;This side-scrolling shooter includes a total of six scenes spanning areas from Earth to the moon. The story begins with a comet discovered in the vicinity of Pluto that is headed on a sudden collision course with Earth. Mankind narrowly succeeds in diverting the cometâs course, and it crashes into the moon. However, investigations into the damage uncover that what hit the moon was not a comet, but a gigantic mother ship. Power up your ship, destroy enemies and fight your way through the bosses in an attempt to reach the moonâs core and protect Earth from alien invasion. Enjoy the unique world of Dead Moon, including various stages with beautiful backgrounds, a power-up system that increases your attack as well as your defense and bosses that have you altering your shipâs direction to fight them.&#8221; &#8230;and the 100th game in the Wii Shop Channel: Zelda II is a direct sequel to the original Legend of Zelda, and again involves the protagonist Link (now 16 years old) on a quest to save a new Princess Zelda who has fallen under a sleeping spell. Zelda IIâs emphasis on side-scrolling and RPG-style elements, however, was a significant change from its predecessor (The Legend of Zelda) and has given it the common reputation as the âblack sheepâ of the series. Nonetheless, the game was highly successful and introduced many elements that would become commonplace in future Zelda games. It was followed in 1992 by The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the Super NES. Zelda IIâ¢ - The Adventure of Link Â® (NES, 1 player, Rated E for Everyone - Mild Fantasy Violence, 500 Wii Points): &#8220;Link returns to Hyrule to search for the Triforce and to awaken Zelda from an endless sleep. Embark on a quest to find the Triforce of Courage and save Hyrule from ruin. Learn magic spells, talk to people in towns to get clues, collect items to increase your power and explore six palaces where the underlings of the evil Ganon await you. This sequel to the Adventure classic uses a side-scrolling visual engine unique to the series for more technical combat, and features more in-depth world roaming as Link encounters townsfolk while on his quest.&#8221; Will you be celebrating the Virtual Console&#8217;s landmark achievement with a purchase of one of its games?

Robert Hansen, CEO of Internet security firm Sectheory.com , said that this latest Google Desktop vulnerability makes use of a âman-in-the-middleâ assault where a malicious hacker steps between a user and Googleâs server.

This new Sony BDP-S300 player costs half of what the companyâs first Blu-ray player, BDP-S1 cost when it launched just six months ago. When Sony announced the BDP-S300 player in February, it put the price at $599, but has now set a list price at $499. Chris Fawcett, vice president of Sony Electronicsâ home products division , the price cut is due to falling production costs and the growing demand for Blu-ray products. The new player has essentially the same capabilities as the older BDP-S1. Read the rest of this story >> Microsoft-Eolas Dispute Case re-opened by Patent Office Microsoft has revealed that the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has agreed to hear Microsoftâs side of the story that the Eolas browser plug-in patent was invalid. The software giant had lost a major $521 million verdict in the patent spat against Eolas. Though the verdict was in due course thrown out by an appeals court, the USPTO later upheld the validity of the Eolas patent, though only Eolas was allowed to submit evidence before that decision was zeroed onto. The Microsoft-Eolas patent battle has been going on since 1999. In the present development of the case, Microsoft states that the USPTO will hear its argument that it, and not Eolas, is the inventor, and therefore the owner, of the browser plug-in technology in question. A five-judge panel within the USPTO will weigh evidence from both sides about the patent&#8217;s validity and ownership. Microsoft stated that the USPTO has already acknowledged Read the rest of this story >> Put your Camera Phone to good use by recording Criminal Activity and reporting it to the Police Europeans are being encouraged to use their camera phones to capture photographs and videos of criminal activity, after which they can send it directly to a national police database. In fact, Dutch technology consultancy Waleli has developed MMS-witness, a system which enables citizens to send photos or movies to a central police database as part of an emergency call. The photographs or videos can be sent to officers so as to increase the chances of a successful arrest. Such photos and videos could also be kept as evidence in further investigations. Waleli chief executive Siete Hamminga said that even though the concept is yet in its early stages, Waleli has conducted a few experiments with police in Rotterdam and will also approach forces in Sweden in conjunction with Ericsson. For starters, the MMS-witness service will be used to allow police and officers from other Read the rest of this story >> Samsung &#8216;C220 Miniskirt&#8217; Handset unveiled for Stylish Women Samsung has unveiled a stylish looking slim slider mobile phone.

The device will be up for grabs to the public on June 29. This info was gathered through two sources, firstly a commercials broadcast on Sunday night and secondly through a company spokesman. The device which bundles in the features of a mobile phone, media player and wireless Web-surfing device is being offered exclusively by AT&#038;T Inc.&#8217;s wireless division, initially known as Cingular. Whatâs perhaps the other most attractive feature apart from having such a breathtaking amalgamation of features is the deviceâs touch-sensitive screen sans keypad, which was revealed with great fanfare in early January by Apple CEO Steve Jobs. He had then given hints that it would appear in stores in June but gave no specific date.

Microsoft Enlists Second Linux Vendor For Controversial Patent Covenants 12:16 PM EDT Mon. Jun. 04, 2007 In a Tech-Ed keynote laden with predictable demos and execuspeak about "dynamic IT for the people-ready business," Microsoft quietly slipped in a bombshell: vendor Xandros has signed on for a broad alliance that includes Microsoft's controversial patent-covenant protection. The deal mirrors the one Microsoft struck with Novell in November , which includes intellectual property license rights guaranteeing that neither vendor will sue the other or their customers for patent infringements. While Microsoft hasn't backed its rhetoric with legal action, the company claims that the Linux infringes hundreds of its patents Bob Muglia, senior vice president in charge of Microsoft's and tools business, slipped mention of the Xandros deal into his opening keynote at Tech-Ed, being held this week in Orlando, Fla. "We work with industry partners to ensure that when customers want to use open-source software, they can do so with the knowledge and security that the software offers all the licenses and rights that the Xandros is one of many second-tier vendors vying for a share of the enterprise Linux market. The Debian-based distribution is its desktop operating system, but during the past year Xandros has shipped business servers for and corporate audiences. In a competitive bake-off of Linux desktops for enterprise users, CRN's Test Center ranked the Xandros 4 Professional Desktop second, behind Novell's SUSE Enterprise Linux Desktop. Microsoft's deal with Novell sparked a firestorm of criticism from open-source advocates irate at the idea of Microsoft pressuring Linux vendors to pay fees to license its intellectual property or risk lawsuits against them and/or their customers over the infringements alledgedly lurking in Linux. While Microsoft's arrangement heavily favored Novell, financially "- Microsoft agreed to give Novell approximately $350 million for software purchases and a licensing "balancing payment" -- it also set a precedent of a Linux vendor paying Microsoft to stave off patent litigation and tacitly legitimize Microsoft's intellectual property claims. Novell agreed to make ongoing payments to Microsoft of at least $40 million over the next five years, based on a percentage of its Linux A Microsoft representative said the company is not releasing any details on its financial arrangements with Xandros. Not eager to wade into a legal morass, Microsoft is hoping to resolve its licensing dispute with Linux distributors through alliances rather than lawsuits. But some key players have balked: Red Hat published a manifesto in opposition and pledged never to pay an "innovation tax," and the Free Software Foundation reworked the soon-to-be-adopted General Public License 3 to prohibit users of GPL 3 software from entering patent-convenant arrangements that protect only their customers.

The average European accesses the net 16.5 days in a month, and spends 24 hours viewing 2,662 web pages, according to tracking firm comScore. The Netherlands has the highest net penetration, with 83% of the country online, the firm reported. Russia, which was included as a European state, has the lowest, at 11% of the population. More than 221m people across the 16 countries surveyed are online each month, comScore said. Germany had the largest online population, with 32.5m net users aged 15 and above, the survey for net usage in May 2007 found. *The percentage of a population aged 15 and above online The UK had the most active online population, spending more than 34.4 hours online each month and a peak of more than 21.8m people online in any given day. Google was the most popular online destination in 13 of the 16 countries, followed by Microsoft in second place and Yahoo in third. Internet penetration across Europe was 40% of the population aged 15 and above, with only Spain (39%), Italy (36%) and Russia (11%) falling below this level. Bob Ivins, managing director of comScore Europe, said: "Increased net usage is tied to broadband roll-out. The UK is an example of a country whose net usage has increased dramatically as broadband has reached more people." He said: "While the study reflects average net usage and penetration, 20% of users account for 60% of usage, with some people spending hundreds of hours online each month." He added: "As convergence takes place between TV and the internet, the nature of what is classed as online and offline will also have to change. "Is someone online when watching TV over the net?"

IT and TELCO JOBS Japan Wiis a lot: 5-to-1 sales over the PS3! Japan Wiis a lot: 5-to-1 sales over the PS3! Tuesday, 05 June 2007 Tokyo gaming research firm Enterbrain says that the Nintendo Wii is outselling the Sony PS3 by a factor of five to one in May, accelerating from four to one in April, in the latest bad PS3 news. Sony slashes 0 off Blu-ray players; is PS3 next? Gearbox dribbles out info on Aliens shooter More rumours quashed, no Gears of War for PS3 Wii-mote can digitise human speech PS3: Rumours of its death have been greatly exaggerated Sony can&rsquo;t even get a lucky break in Japan, where the Wii is seriously outselling the PS3, as reported by Bloomberg. Bloomberg quotes the Tokyo gaming research company Enterbrain Inc with the information, and say that while Nintendo sold 251,794 Wii consoles, Sony only sold around 50,000 units. This compares with 11,082 Xbox 360&rsquo;s from Microsoft, showing they are doing even worse in Japan, although naturally they are still selling units at more than 2000 per week, while the Nintendo DS is doing to the PSP what the Wii is doing to the PS3: also outselling it five to one. Enterbrain&rsquo;s figures are 620,670 DS handheld consoles compared with only 123,673 PSP&rsquo;s. This is all despite the Wii having the worst graphics, standard definition instead of high definition, no hard disk, the inability to play DVD movies, no Blu-ray or HD DVD &ndash; but simply a unique control mechanism that has caught the imagination of people around the planet. At figures of around 50,000 units sold for the PS3 in May, Sony are still selling over 10,000 PS3&rsquo;s per week, which is nothing to be sneezed at, and as programmers release better quality PS3 games and that take better advantage of the PS3&rsquo;s own motion sensing capabilities, we should start seeing an upsurge in PS3 sales. But for now the Wii rules the roost, with a long hard slog ahead for Sony and Microsoft to take back the initiative, especially come the big holiday/Christmas season later this year, in what will be the biggest console gaming battle to be fought ever.

Latest McAfee Report deems Music and Tech-related Search Terms the Riskiest Monday, June 4th, 2007 According to a study by McAfeeâs SiteAdvisor group, more than 276 million Web searches monthly link to sites deemed dangerous by SiteAdvisor. The study is part of a report called âThe State of Search Engine Safetyâ released today. For instance, the study found around 42 per cent of the results using the term âscreensavers,â led to sites flagged with a âredâ warning or a cautionary âyellowâ by McAfeeâs SiteAdvisor service. Besides, other keywords that McAfee deemed risky include names of popular file-sharing software such as âBearShareâ, âLimeWireâ and âKazaaâ. In many cases, the programs come bundled with adware and toolbars that McAfee considers unwanted. However, McAfee did find that it was slightly safer to use search engines on the whole. Although about 4 per cent of search results lead to sites deemed risky, this number has dropped down from 5 per cent a year ago. Mark Maxwell, senior product manager for SiteAdvisor , âWe&#8217;ve seen some incremental steps in the right direction. But the average Joe user should be aware there&#8217;s still plenty to be concerned about.&#8221; Risks are greater when clicking on keyword ads that make up much of search companies&#8217; revenues: According to McAfee, 7 percent of such links produce risky sites, down from 8.5 percent a year ago. SiteAdvisor rates sites based on whether they result in spyware, viruses, excessive pop-up ads, junk e-mail or other threats. The study was conducted by running about 2,300 popular keywords through the top five search engines _ Google Inc., Yahoo Inc., Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s MSN, Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s AOL and IAC/InterActive Corp.&#8217;s Ask. Search companies have taken steps to mitigate the risks. Google, for instance, sometimes flags links to sites it deems risky, and McAfee found a notable drop in risk when using Google, AOL and Ask. Ask and AOL get search ads from Google, and AOL uses Google to power regular search results as well. Tim Dowling, a McAfee VP , &#8220;an active search engine user, one that performs more than 10 searches per day, is likely to visit a dangerous site at least once a day.&#8221; Mark Maxwell noted that SiteAdvisor users average more searches than the general population, possibly because they feel confident they won&#8217;t wind up at a dangerous site. Naturally McAfee encourages all Internet users to download the free SiteAdvisor utility, or purchase the more powerful SiteAdvisor Plus ($24.99/year, $5 off for the first year). | You can skip to the end and leave a response.

http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/69205.html&cid Microsoft expands Live Search Books by including copyright content Microsoft expands Live Search Books by including copyright content Mon, 04 Jun 2007 16:42:00GMT Create your own RSS Internet Technology News | Microsoft announced that it has obtained permission from various publishers to include copyrighted material into the beta version of its Live Search Books. By obtaining permission from publishers, Microsoft hopes to avoid getting sucked into copyright battles over the content displayed on its service. Its main rival, Google Inc is already facing two lawsuits for displaying copyrighted material without prior permission from the publishers. Live Search program manager Betsy Aoki confirmed as much on the company's blog by stating, "We have paid particular attention to ensuring that we are only including books in our index that our publishing partners have given us permission to include. So our customers and partners can feel secure in our stance on copyright protection." This means that users of the service will be able to read books published by companies such as Cambridge University Press, McGraw-Hill, Rodale and Simon and Schuster. Some of the links can also point users to websites from where they can buy the books. Google has already launched such a service, but is currently battling problems related to copyright materials, with authors and publishers accusing the company of infringing on their copyrights. Google had to then modify its service and display only parts of the books for reading online, with information from where users can purchase those books.

In the request, which was filed in the Court of Common Pleas in Dauphin County, home to the state capital of Harrisburg, MySpace said it is actively seeking advice on how it can legally provide authorities with registered sex offenders' contact information. MySpace came under fire last month when a group of state attorneys general, including Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, wrote an open letter to the social-networking site demanding that it turn over data pertaining to registered sex offenders who have profiles on the site. MySpace initially refused, citing federal and state privacy laws, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986, that the company said from releasing such information. But two weeks ago, that it planned to comply with the request to provide the states with sex offender data, acknowledging that it would have to deal with varying legal requirements in each state. The request filed in Pennsylvania is part of that ongoing plan. "We're very pleased with how this process is working but our desire to provide certain information, such as the content of e-mail messages, is proving complicated under applicable law," the social network's executive vice president and general counsel, Michael Angus, said in a statement on Monday. "Attorney General Corbett has requested we provide the content of e-mail messages of specific registered sex offenders identified by Sentinel Safe," Angus said, referring to the database that MySpace has developed through a partnership with identity verification firm Sentinel Tech Holding. "We want to provide those messages and today have filed a request with the state court in Pennsylvania, asking a judge for guidance on how best to provide the e-mail content without tainting any potential evidence that could help put a registered sex offender behind bars." MySpace members can privately message each others' profiles through an e-mail system within the site. According to MySpace, a federal court determined that the ECPA requires that a search warrant be issued before the social-networking service turns over the content of e-mail messages sent through the site, and that a positive identification through the Sentinel Safe database would not by itself suffice.

The release date was announced in three advertisements posted on Apple&#39;s Web site yesterday. Until now Cupertino, California-based Apple had only said the device, which combines a mobile phone with the iPod music player, would go on sale in late June. Apple has shipped more than 100 million iPods since Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs introduced the player in 2001. He&#39;s seeking to parlay that popularity into sales of the iPhone, setting a goal of selling 10 million units in 2008. Availability may be limited, which could build ``buzz&#39;&#39; for the product, JPMorgan Securities Inc. analyst Bill Shope said in a report today. ``Users may put off iPod purchases for the iPhone, but they may have to deal with a long wait,&#39;&#39; Shope said. He also said Apple will ``need to go beyond just buzz&#39;&#39; to justify the phone&#39;s price and two-year contract for consumers. JP Morgan is keeping its ``neutral&#39;&#39; rating on the shares, he said. Shares of Apple, which also makes the Macintosh computer, climbed $2.93, or 2.5 percent, to $121.33 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. They have risen 42 percent since Jobs announced the iPhone on Jan. 9. Apple&#39;s market capitalization topped $100 billion for the first time last week. Two iPhone models will be available: a $499 version with 4 gigabytes of memory and an 8-gigabyte model for $599. Apple will sell the device with help from AT&T Inc., the largest U.S. mobile-phone service. The iPhone will be available in Europe later this year and in Asia in 2008. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said last week that expectations are ``too low&#39;&#39; for iPhone sales. He said San Antonio-based AT&T has attracted interest from more than 1 million customers for the device, which features a touch-screen display instead of a physical keyboard and lets users access e-mail and surf the Web. ``I think they&#39;ll ship 10 million this calendar year,&#39;&#39; said Stephen Coleman, chief investment officer at St. Louis-based Daedelus Capital, which has owned Apple&#39;s shares since February 2004. Coleman said he plans to be among those buyers. The iPhone may buoy sales as Apple introduces new iPod and Mac models. Analysts expect a new video iPod based on the iPhone design as well as updated computers in coming months. That may spur back-to-school and holiday orders. Jobs, 52, last quarter also introduced Apple TV, a $299 set- top box that beams digital videos from computers to widescreen televisions. And he announced a deal last week to display videos from Google Inc.&#39;s YouTube online service using the device. In April, Apple said second-quarter profit rose 88 percent to $770 million as more customers bought iPods and Mac computers. Declining prices for memory chips and screens also helped boost the company&#39;s profit margin. Of the analysts who follow Apple shares, 23 rate them ``buy,&#39;&#39; four have ``hold&#39;&#39; ratings, and none advise selling, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

A significant portion of open-source software is free, while paid distributions typically derive revenue from ongoing subscriptions rather than up-front purchases. China Unveils New Global Warming Plan Bald Eagle Coming Off Endangered List? Liver Cancer Breakthrough Found Wildlife Watchdog Eyes Trade Limits Death Toll from Katrina Rising with HP's All-in-One Storage Systems. Simple and affordable ways to set I.T. free. A new report by IDC concludes that stand-alone, open-source software is poised to become a $5.8 billion industry by 2011, up from $1.8 billion in 2006. That represents a compound annual growth rate of 26 percent over that time period, and, according to IDC, it might go higher. "We are in the early stages of the development and deployment of OSS," Matt Lawton, program director of IDC's Open Source Software Business Models research program, said in press statement. "The market is still quite immature, especially now that we see active open-source projects in all layers of the software stack." The IDC report identifies several reasons for the increase, including increased interest in open-source software as a tool for negotiating with proprietary software vendors, more financial backing of open source by venture capitalists, increased comfort with a subscription-payment model, and a rising interest in open-source software in general. In a telephone interview, Lawton said that, despite the impressive growth in open-source software adoption, it still represents a tiny fraction of the worldwide software industry. One significant finding in the IDC study, Lawton said, is that revenues for open-source software companies will lag behind the adoption of the software itself. A significant portion of open-source software is free, while paid distributions typically derive revenue from ongoing subscriptions rather than up-front purchases. "Some of the barriers that have prevented customers from paying for open source are coming down," Lawton suggested. "There were concerns about the availability of support, but vendors are starting to offer professional support. There also has been a lot of publicity around the risk of infringement of patented software. We found that it is an issue, but not a huge one for customers. Also, vendors are getting more comfortable with getting revenue from open source." Overall, Lawton said, customers are realizing that the quality of open-source software is often quite high, and there is a lot that is commercial-grade. The steadily improving quality of open-source software, the increased availability of reliable support, and the projected growth in revenues are all helping to make proprietary software companies nervous. "Open-source software has two impacts on proprietary-software companies," Lawton said. "It helps open up new markets, where we're seeing a growth in software adoption and revenue generated. And as adoption rates increase, open-sources software also eats into the revenues of proprietary-software companies in existing markets."

Follow-up: NASA, Michael Griffin, global warming, and earth-science research NASAs STS-117 heading to space station June 8, 2007 Global Exploration Strategy coordinates space plans of NASA and others NASA boss Michael Griffin on Global Warming South Korea announces plans to explore planets as soon as 2017 Already three months behind in its 2007 schedule after its March 15th delay of STS-117 due to a , NASA hopes to pick up its mission schedule with the launching of Space Shuttle on June 8, 2007. International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers union is planning a strike involving nearly 600 space shuttle program workers at the Kennedy Space Center. The union represents the spaceflight operations employees of the (USA). The company is one of the largest space operations companies in the world. Most of the contractor employees at NASA&rsquo;s Kennedy Space Center are USA employees. The Boeing Company and Lockheed Martin Corporation own USA jointly. In all, USA employs around 10,000 people in the states of Florida, Texas, and Alabama, and the Washington, D.C. area. Primarily, USA possesses a NASA contract&mdash;called the Space Program Operations Contract (SPOC)&mdash;to operate and process the fleet of Space Shuttles and to handle operations for the International Space Station. Talks between union officials with the Bargaining Committee for Local 2061 (Cocoa, Florida) and representatives of USA resumed on May 29, 2007, with respect to a proposed new contract. However, ratification of the contract, which was voted on Saturday, June 2, 2007, did not succeed. was cited as being &ldquo;substandard&rdquo; on the union side and &ldquo;fair, competitive and responsive&rdquo; from the company side. The primary issues for these 600 workers center around job security and retirement benefits as NASA shifts its work force from Space Shuttle operations to the new Orion/Ares operations over the next three years. (Space Shuttle operations are planned to conclude in 2010 and Orion/Ares operations are scheduled to start up in 2015.) Negotiators have instituted a five-day cooling-off period for both sides of the issue. These 600 aerospace workers plan to strike as early as June 10th, two days after the planned launch of and its Space Shuttle crew going to the International Space Station for NASA&#39;s continuing assembly missions. NASA and USA contend that a strike will not affect its support of the mission. However, NASA admits that a drawn-out strike could affect the processing of the next mission&mdash; and the Space Shuttle &mdash;as these striking workers help to join the orbiter with the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) and the eternal tank (ET). STS-118 is currently scheduled to launch on October 9, 2007. USA officials state that even with a strike, they will have enough fully certified, trained, and qualified people to perform all of its functions with regard to current and future flights of the NASA Space Shuttles. Only the future will decide if NASA will be able to keep on schedule safely along with resolving this strike with part of its KSC contractor employee work force.

After a three-month delay, the year's first mission is set to launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 6:38 p.m. Friday. A half-dozen station-assembly missions are planned over the next 12 months, enough new construction to outfit the station with European and Japanese research modules. Atlantis leads the parade with a crew of seven astronauts trained to deliver and install a $367.3 million solar-power generation module during an 11-day mission. The new module's outstretched solar panels will give the station a new look as well as gains in electrical power for the new labs. Also, the shuttle will return to Earth with U.S. astronaut Sunita "Suni" Williams, whose 6 1/2 -month mission to the space station is drawing to a close. Her 192-day mission will be the longest flown by any woman. She will be replaced in space by American Clayton Anderson, one of the Atlantis astronauts. "This is a pretty intense period for us," said Mike Suffredini, NASA's space station program manager. "From a concentration standpoint, this is one of our most challenging periods." At the planned pace the space agency should finish the station's assembly by September 2010, the date established for the shuttle fleet's retirement by the White House. Atlantis was poised for a March 15 liftoff when a hail storm pummeled the protective foam insulation that jackets the ship's external fuel tank, leaving 4,200 divots. The agency, which responded with an around-the-clock repair effort, is not expecting wiggle room in the 2010 deadline, though some experts believe NASA should have leeway to respond to hail storms, hurricanes and other events beyond its control. "We have no plans to fly past that date at all," said NASA's Wayne Hale, the shuttle program manager. The cap was imposed by the White House in 2004 to free billions in funding for the shuttle's replacement, a new spacecraft that can launch astronauts to the moon as well as the space station. "What's so sacrosanct about 2010?" asked Jerry Grey, director of science and technology policy for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the nation's largest professional organization for engineers in the two fields. "Suppose the shuttle is still flying in 2011. Aside from not conforming exactly to the president's original timetable, what's the difference?" Grey said. "Space exploration cannot be done effectively on a tight schedule  it's a long-term activity and should be programmed as such." In response to the Feb. 26 hail storm, NASA repaired the foam by filling in the largest divots with liquid foam patches and spray-overs. Minor blemishes were sanded away. The foam prevents a crust of ice from forming as the towering metal fuel tank is filled with super-cold propellants during countdown and protects the tip from destructive overheating as the ship accelerates through the Earth's atmosphere. If unleashed in flight, pieces of ice or foam become destructive projectiles if they strike the ship's vulnerable heat shield. The shuttle Columbia's deadly breakup in 2003 was traced to a break in the heat shielding caused by a hunk of breakaway fuel tank foam. NASA's planned flight rate over the next year will match the peak of six station-assembly missions launched in 2001. That pace, the space agency acknowledges, could test safety standards NASA embraced after the Columbia tragedy. "Clearly, having a schedule helps us organize our work," said Hale. "But we fully intend to keep all of our safety practices in place. We can't let the schedule drive us to do something dumb." He took that message to many of the 17,000 people who work on the shuttle through "all-hands" sessions this year at major NASA installations. "We can't take our eye off the ball," he warned them. The agency has time to launch up to 15 flights to the space station as well as a repair mission to the Hubble Space Telescope before the shuttle is retired, said Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for space operations. Process is slow going Atlantis' mission will trace ground broken by missions in September and December, which marked a revival of station construction that ground to a halt after Columbia's loss. In September, spacewalkers struggled with tools to remove stubborn restraint bolts, the fasteners required to immobilize 17 tons of new station hardware during the shuttle's launching. If stuck in place after installation, the launch restraint bolts would have prevented rotations of a mechanism that enabled a pair of long solar panels to track the sun while the station orbits Earth. In December, astronauts extended the mission to add a spacewalk after having difficulties retracting a solar panel on an older power module. The 110-foot panel was jammed repeatedly by misaligned guidewires and sluggish hinges. The Atlantis crew will deliver a solar-power module identical to the hardware launched on the September mission. The crew also will retract a solar panel identical to the one that proved troublesome in December. "This flight is a lot like a couple of previous flights," said Jim Reilly, the astronaut who will quarterback the mission's three spacewalks. "We have to do the same things those guys did  only better." IN Houston & Texas News Rape, slaying detailed in capital murder trial Boy, 2, drowns in Harris County retention pond Fire damages Rep.

The handset will cost $500 (Â£252) or $600 (Â£302), depending on the amount of memory included. It also features a touch screen, built-in camera and light and orientation sensors. But critics have pointed out that it uses GSM, an older wireless technology that is slowly being fazed out by 3G networks that are said to transmit data much faster. Apple&#039;s chief executive Steve Jobs revealed the iPhone in January after rumours that the company was planning to produce a mobile phone which included features from its iPod music and video players. The company plans to branch out and sell the handset in Europe and Japan, but specific dates are yet to be announced Apple&#039;s stock has been sensitive in recent weeks to any rumours about the phone&#039;s launch, but shares rose seven per cent last week and have nearly doubled over the past year.

DVD Drives & Media Toshiba Puts HD DVD-RW in Laptop Toshiba will unveil slim SD-L912A HD DVD on Tuesday. Part 1 of a special five-part series. Martyn Williams, IDG News Service Monday, June 04, 2007 7:00 AM PDT Toshiba Corp. will unveil in Taipei on Tuesday a slim HD DVD rewriter suitable for use in laptop computers. The SD-L912A, which will be unveiled at the Computex trade show, can read and rewrite to single and dual-layer HD DVD-RW discs and also read and write to recordable HD DVD, DVD and CD media, Toshiba said Monday on the eve of the Computex trade show in the Taiwanese capital. Sample shipments of the drive to PC makers will begin in July. A single-layer HD DVD-RW disc can store up to 20G bytes of information, which is just over 4 times the capacity of an equivalent DVD. Toshiba expects the drive will find favor among manufacturers of multimedia laptop computers. Applications like digital television recording or high-definition video editing are pushing up storage demands and leading many users to store data on optical discs or external hard-disk drives. The drive is compliant with the European Union Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations (ROHS) directive. Pricing information was not immediately available. Toshiba plans to offer the drive on an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) basis to PC makers and not as a drive direct to consumers. / 1000 max characters Copying HD DVD, Blu-ray Discs May Become Legal The Latest in Motion-Sensitive Cell Phones, High-Def Recorders, and Camcorders New DVD Restrictions Loom Top 5 Internal DVD Drives New Specs for Next-Generation Blu-ray Players Xandros Joins Novell in Licensing Microsoft IP Linux distributor agrees to licensing deal similar to the one Novell struck with Microsoft last year.

Jorge Romero, 24, used a Web site to download the first four episodes of the sixth season of "24" and then uploaded them to LiveDigital.com, according to a federal complaint filed in Los Angeles on Friday. The episodes appeared online more than a week before their television debuts on Jan. 14 and 15. In this undated file photo, originally released by Fox TV, actor Kiefer Sutherland appears in the hit series "24". (AP Photo/2005 Fox Broadcasting Co., Anthony Mandler) Email to a friend Romero was charged with one felony count of uploading copyrighted material to a publicly accessible computer network knowing the work was intended for commercial distribution. He has agreed to surrender at the US District Courthouse in Chicago on Tuesday, when arrangements will be made for his travel to Los Angeles, Department of Justice Spokesman Thom Mrozek said. It was not immediately known whether Romero had retained an attorney. E-mails and phone calls to addresses listed in court documents as Romero's were not immediately returned. If convicted, Romero faces a maximum of three years in prison. Â© The Canadian Press 2007 Scandal Sheet: Brad Pitt Brad Pitt was spotted in Montreal...

On Sunday, Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr confirmed the product's launch date following the airing of television commercials touting the iPhone. The ads illustrated some of the hybrid cell phone, media player and wireless Internet gadget's features - such as its shiny touch screen - and ended by stating the phone will be available "Only on the new AT&T" and "Coming June 29." The ads were also posted on Apple's Web site. Apple shares gained $2.33 to $120.73 in midday trading. In a note to clients Monday, JP Morgan analyst Bill Shope wrote that he thinks the iPhone will be available in limited supply because it faces a "difficult production ramp." "In this case, it may be reasonable to conclude that limited availability will only heighten the buzz surrounding the product's launch," he wrote. Shope, who has a "Neutral" rating for the stock, thinks shares of Apple are "priced for perfection," and wrote that he worries limited availability of the iPhone could hurt the company's iPod business. Some customers might not buy iPods in favor of waiting for the iPhone, but this could entail long waits, he said. The analyst also expressed concern over the product's price, which runs $499 for a 4GB iPhone and $599 for an 8GB iPhone. "In our view, Apple will need to go beyond just buzz to convince a large number of users to bear this expense," Shope wrote. Apple's stock has risen steadily over the last few months as anticipation has mounted over the product. On May 25, the company's stock climbed after a media report stated the iPhone would be available June 20. At the time, AT&T and Apple would neither confirm or deny that date. AT&T shares added 13 cents to $40.66. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Aun Part of the ECT News Network 06/04/07 10:43 AM PT In their pursuit of the bottom line, search engines have put consumers at risk, according to findings from McAfee SiteAdvisor. The company's latest study has found that, while Web search results are generally getting safer, there is much work to be done in weeding out unscrupulous advertisers bent on jilting buyers. However, when does weeding out amount to Net censorship? Visual Sciences & WebSideStory: One Brand. One Mission. Learn how Visual Sciences' breakthrough technologies enable over 1500 clients to correlate data across channels and perform ad hoc query analysis in real-time, delivering fast answers to hard questions. Discover the New Visual Sciences Today! The latest search engine safety report by states that Web search results are slowly getting safer, but it also asserts that search providers can do more to weed out sponsored links from scammers, malware spewers and other "bad actors." Search engine companies have the ability to clamp down on unscrupulous search-based advertisers (such as those buying ads through AdSense program) but seem to ignore the problem for fear of losing revenue, the report said. So-called organic searches, wherein Web surfers seek sites by entering search terms in search windows, are significantly safer than clicking on the sponsored search results that often result from those initial queries, according to the study. McAfee SiteAdvisor found that sponsored results contain 2.4 times as many risky sites as organic results. Watch Where You Look "Search engines vary most in the safety of their sponsored results," stated the report. It noted that 4.1 percent of the sites served up via sponsored results at met McAfee SiteAdvisor's definition of "risky" while 9 percent of those produced on were unsafe. "So users clicking on an ad are more than twice as likely to encounter a risky site on Yahoo than on Ask," noted the authors. The fact that the numbers vary means search engine providers have some control over the quality of their advertisers, said the report. "Search engines can look the other way while dubious ads run rampant, but they can also set and enforce tough editorial policies to keep bad ads out," said the study's writers. "Unfortunately, current guidelines primarily focus on ensuring appropriate ad copy as opposed to Web site safety." "I am not exactly sure that it is the search engines' responsibility to provide safe search results anyway," said Kevin Finisterre, a security researcher with Digital Munition, told TechNewsWorld. "In my mind, a search engine is simply indexing what is out there already. I should honestly be able to receive my search results in an unfiltered manor. What is to stop the search engine company from deciding that my personal site is malicious and subsequently deciding to not list it in their page rankings?" He enjoys "the fact that you can use search engines to dig up all kinds of random bits and bytes that you may not normally be able to find," Finisterre said, and a search engine would "begin to lose value" if it began filtering results. Censorship or Consumer Protection? The main problem is with bogus sponsored links, said Ben Edelman, a Harvard University assistant professor and a coauthor of the report. The study is not calling for censorship, he stressed. "We don't call it censorship when publishers protect users from scams and frauds," Edelman told TechNewsWorld. "There is no proper place on Google for an ad trying to sell you , which sophisticated users know is actually free." Some cases, agreed Finisterre, are over the line. "I guess where I would take concern personally would be if the images being served up by AdSense became tainted with a Windows , for example," he said. "[But] if some jerk company pays Google for an ad and has enough page rank for people to click on the link ... I don't know. I think that's a pretty thin line between customer ignorance and Google's responsibility." There is a "tension between free speech and consumer protection," Edelman acknowledged, but he said nobody should be free to cheat consumers. "In my view, that is actually not a hard question," said Edelman. "There's no free speech to defraud. We're talking about ads right now, not organic results. In that context, usually there's a human making the decisions ... including a right of review. So if your ad is rejected by Google, you can write to Google and ask why." Some sponsored link filtering seems to be taking place, the report said, but it isn't happening as much as it should. "Still, we are struck by search engines' failure to block even the most notorious and widespread of scam ads -- a decision we suspect arises out of search engines' business objectives," wrote the authors. "Excluding bad ads would reduce search engines' revenues by leaving fewer bidders buying ad space -- so search engines have strong incentives to retain even unsavory advertisers." The good news, according to the report, is that search results have become safer during the past year. "Both organic and sponsored results on Google, and Ask now contain a lower percentage of sites rated red or yellow by McAfee SiteAdvisor than they did last year," says the report. "However, Yahoo and have become less safe over the past year. MSN and Yahoo were the two safest search engines in our May 2006 tests, but now their search results contain the highest percentages of risky sites." AOL, the report said, is the safest place to conduct a Web search, and searches for digital music and technology "continue to be among the most dangerous search terms."

A confidential report to the White House, obtained by The Associated Press, warns that U.S. scientists will soon lose much of their ability to monitor warming from space using a costly and problem-plagued satellite initiative begun more than a decade ago. Because of technology glitches and a near-doubling in the original $6.5 billion cost, the Defense Department has decided to downsize and launch four satellites paired into two orbits, instead of six satellites and three orbits. The satellites were intended to gather weather and climate data, replacing existing satellites as they come to the end of their useful lifetimes beginning in the next couple of years. The reduced system of four satellites will now focus on weather forecasting. Most of the climate instruments needed to collect more precise data over long periods are being eliminated. Instead, the Pentagon and two partners - the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA - will rely on European satellites for most of the climate data. "Unfortunately, the recent loss of climate sensors ... places the overall climate program in serious jeopardy," NOAA and NASA scientists told the White House in the Dec. 11 report obtained by the AP. They said they will face major gaps in data that can be collected only from satellites about ice caps and sheets, surface levels of seas and lakes, sizes of glaciers, surface radiation, water vapor, snow cover and atmospheric carbon dioxide. Rick Piltz, director of Climate Science Watch, a watchdog program of the Washington-based Government Accountability Project, called the situation a crisis. "We're going to start being blinded in our ability to observe the planet," said Piltz, whose group provided the AP with the previously undisclosed report. "It's criminal negligence, and the leaders in the climate science community are ringing the alarm bells on this crisis." Bush has repeatedly cited his administration's record on researching global warming as a response to criticism of his opposition to forced reductions in the greenhouse gases blamed for it. The administration has been spending about $5 billion a year on global warming: $2 billion on climate research and $3 billion on technologies for combatting it. Last week, the president proposed the idea of the 15 largest global-warming polluters - the U.S. is the largest, followed closely by China - meeting to set goals for fixing the problem while leaving it up to each nation just how to do it. The problem will be a major topic at this week's summit of world leaders in Europe. Bush requested $331 million for work on the scaled-back satellite system next year in his fiscal 2008 budget proposal. Congress has yet to act on it. The American Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Academy of Sciences have both cautioned that downsizing the satellite program will result in major gaps in the continuity and quality of the data gathered about the Earth from space. NASA and NOAA agreed in April to restore sensors that will enable the satellites to map ozone. NOAA Administrator Conrad Lautenbacher said that would give scientists a better idea of the content and distribution of atmospheric gases. But seven other separate climate sensors are still being eliminated or substantially downgraded by lower-quality equipment to save money, according to the report to the White House. Most of the satellites, which were scheduled to launch starting next year, have been delayed to between 2013 and 2026. White House science adviser Jack Marburger, for whom the report was intended, acknowledged that climate scientists had been depending greatly on the planned satellites. "We're obviously very concerned about this," he told the AP. "It got in trouble and we couldn't fit all those instruments on it ... leaving us with a number of problems and questions: How do we maintain our momentum in this very important area of science?" NASA spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson told the AP a final version of the "impacts" report was delivered to Marburger on Jan. 8. It was not made public because it is "a pre-decisional document within the administration," she said. NASA and NOAA also are looking for guidance from the National Research Council, which is holding a workshop on the satellites this month. Chet Koblinsky, director of NOAA's climate program office, told the council the satellites "represented the cornerstone of the nation's future space-based climate research program," according to PowerPoint slides obtained by AP. The delays were caused in part because of problems with an infrared sensor that officials either didn't monitor closely enough or didn't bring to the attention of their managers, the Commerce Department's inspector general reported last year. That report also said a contractor on the project was receiving excessive fees. The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, or NPOESS, was first announced in 1994. It was an effort to combine weather-forecasting satellites operated by the Defense Department and NOAA and add climate data-gathering instruments. The plans also involved the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites and the National Space Development Agency of Japan. By 2005, however, the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, found the costs for the U.S. satellites could run to $9.7 billion and were almost a year and a half behind schedule. The Pentagon last year pegged the cost at $11.5 billion and found that it was further behind schedule. Jerry Mahlman, a former scientist at NOAA who is now at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said he and other colleagues warned of problems as far back as 1995. He compared the preparations for the satellites to a "planned train wreck." AP Science Writer Seth Borenstein contributed to this report.

This has led to a burgeoning virtual economy in which thousands of people already make part or all of their real life income from their Second Life businesses by converting Linden dollars to US dollars at an exchange rate of L$268 to US$1. More than 150 Second Life residents are earning US$5000 a month from Second Life, according to Linden Labs. One of the biggest opportunities for making Linden dollars is in real estates and land speculation. Russell Hills, head of tax with KPMG in Scotland, said the Treasury ought to take a more proactive stance towards the taxation of profits earned in online worlds including Second Life. Hills said: "The amount of publicity around people in the game means some are using it as a business opportunity to make a profit." A resident named Anshe Chung - who is really a woman named Ailin Graef - has become the website's most successful businesswoman by developing themed communities, accumulating US$1m in assets within Second Life. Hills stated: "The issue is the extent to which wealth that is being generated in the virtual world is being recycled and remaining there - or being withdrawn into the real world and converted into real money. "I do also wonder if Linden Labs has missed a trick - perhaps they themselves could have taxed revenue in order to help fund the development of their platform." KPMG believes that the UK government should assess the scope for tax planning and fraud, as well as considering the tax implications for virtual businesses. Hills added: "I have yet to hear whether KPMG will be opening an office in Second Life. It depends how far people's imaginations can go." &copy; All rights reserved.

It prohibits trucks from idling for more than three minutes. It has a seasonal leaf blower ban. It's got a Green Policy Task Force that has just been introduced to the public and which hopes to start small and move on to bigger things. Cities are taking the lead on curbing greenhouse emissions and trying to moderate climate change, and Yonkers is among the latest to join the effort. "When it comes to global warming, cities are both the problem and the solution," writes the U.S. Conference of Mayors on its climate protection page. Cities take up less than 1 percent of the Earth's land but generate 80 percent of greenhouse gases, so their actions can make a difference. That was the idea behind the meeting of mayors of more than 40 large international cities in New York last month. Those attending the climate summit said they could not wait for national policies to combat global warming. That's just as well. In the United States, the drive to address global warming has been coming from the bottom up. President Bush resisted global goals for curbing greenhouse gas emissions. He rejected the Kyoto Protocol on the grounds that the measure to limit emissions did not bind India and China, two major polluters, in the same way as it did the United States. But Bush has been under pressure from the international community too, and last week, for the first time, he proposed setting "a long-term global goal" for cutting emissions. If the United States follows through, it could mean a shift in U.S. policy, though environmentalists remain skeptical of exactly what Bush plans. But here's a funny thing. Bush's announcement came just as the administrator of NASA, Michael Griffin, went on National Public Radio and said he did not know whether climate change was a long-term concern. "I am not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with," Griffin said on "Morning Edition" on Thursday, the same day Bush was giving his speech. "To assume that it is a problem is to assume that the state of Earth's climate today is the optimal climate, the best climate that we could have or ever have had and that we need to take steps to make sure that it doesn't change." Deciding that our climate now was the best climate for all human beings was an arrogant position, he concluded. It was startling to hear him, and as you can imagine, the criticism came fast. The Associated Press pointed out that Griffin's own agency had just put out a press release about a research paper written by nearly 50 scientists from NASA and Columbia University. It showed how "human-made greenhouse gases have brought the Earth's climate close to critical tipping points, with potentially dangerous consequences for the planet." James Hansen, a top NASA climate scientist and the lead author of the paper, was quoted by the AP as saying that millions of people will likely be harmed by global warming in the future. It was Griffin's comments that showed arrogance. Even if all of these top scientists turn out to be wrong, what is the harm in finding ways to pursue economic growth while curbing our pollution? Shouldn't that be what we are trying to do? On the other hand, can you imagine the harm if Griffin is wrong? "The devastation with sea level rise of several meters, with hundreds of millions of refugees, would dwarf that of New Orleans," Hansen wrote an e-mail to the AP. Contrast Griffin's statements with what the mayors, Republicans and Democrats, are doing. More than 500 have signed the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, committing their cities to: - strive to meet or beat the Kyoto Protocol targets, - urge the federal government to meet or beat the Kyoto Protocol targets for the United States, that is, a 7 percent reduction from 1990 levels by 2012, and - ask the U.S. Congress to pass legislation that would establish a national emission-trading system. Greenburgh, Irvington, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle and White Plains are taking part. They are leaving the federal government behind. At the international climate summit last month, former President Clinton announced that 15 cities would renovate buildings with green technology under a program spearheaded by Clinton's foundation. The AP reported that major banking institutions had committed $1 billion to finance the improvements to the city-owned buildings. New York is among the cities participating. Cities are the front line of pollution. Mayors cannot afford to have theoretical discussions like Griffin's. Because here's something to think about. Last Thursday, the state Department of Environmental Conservation announced an air-quality advisory for the metropolitan area. Too much ozone in the air. Reach Noreen O'Donnell at or 914-694-5017.

ESAâs Venus Express, in orbit around Venus since 11 April 2006, will be joined for a few hours by NASAâs MESSENGER (MErcury Surface Space ENvironment GEochemistry and Ranging mission), flying by Venus while on its way to Mercury. Earth-based observatories and telescopes in orbit around Earth will also be watching. Looking at Venus together, spacecraft and ground observatories will obtain a unique set of data each, so many different âeyesâ will observe the same regions and phenomena during the same time frame. This event, coordinated from both sides of the Atlantic, might help us learn some things about Venus that may otherwise be out of reach. Scientists believe that direct and two-point measurements of some planetary phenomena have great potential to offer new science. On Earth, international teams of ESAâs Venus Express and NASAâs MESSENGER mission are coordinating the observations of Venus as MESSENGER makes its closest approach to Venus during its second fly â by of the planet. This time around, MESSENGER will be in a better condition with respect to its first fly-by, when the planet was behind the Sun, barring all communication with Earth. It will also be a great opportunity for MESSENGER to test its instruments before it reaches its destination. The MESSENGER fly-by, an illustration Geometry and timing of closest approach At the time of closest approach, MESSENGER will be flying over Venus at an altitude of approximately 337 kilometres. Maximum vicinity will be reached at 01:08 CEST on 6 June, above the Venusian coordinates 12.25Â° South and 165Â° East. At this time, Venus Express will be behind Venus, but it will look at the same regions observed by MESSENGER before and after the fly-by. This will allow the scientists to compare data of the same areas obtained by the two spacecraft within only a short difference in time from each other. Venus Express and MESSENGER together will carry out observations of Venusâ cloud deck, plasma environment, atmosphere and its oxygen airglow and surface. At closest approach, MESSENGER will perform direct sounding measurements of Venusâ cloud deck with its laser altimeter instrument (MLA). These will complement the data about the clouds obtained by Venus Express at visible, ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths. The two spacecraft will also be gathering information about the dynamics of Venusâ atmosphere. In this task, they will be joined by a telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence in France which will also be taking measurements of Venusian winds. This fly-by campaign will also include complementary observations of the oxygen airglow. This is a phenomenon detectable on the night-side and on the dayside and makes the planet glow like a âspace lanternâ. At the same time, on Earth, the IRTF facility in Hawaii will observe the same phenomenon in the infrared, along with the Apache Point Observatory (APO) (working at visible wavelengths) and the W. M. Keck observatory in Hawaii. The study of the Venusian plasma environment will greatly benefit from the presence of two spacecraft around Venus. Plasma - a gas of charged particles diffused in space and strongly influenced by solar activity - is a very complex state of matter. Its has a very low density but its scale of distribution around planets is huge. Hence the possibility of a multipoint observation campaign at Venus is a unique asset that helps understand the plasma behaviour around this planet. The advantage of multipoint plasma measurements has largely been demonstrated by the constellation of Cluster spacecraft studying the plasma environment around Earth and by the Cassini-Huygens and Galileo spacecraft at Jupiter, during the Cassini-Huygens flyby of the Jovian system in late 2000. After about 30 hours after closest approach, MESSENGER will have concluded its observation campaign of Venus, ready for its next and final target: Mercury. During the fly-by, instruments on Venus Express will be operated so as to maximize the synergy between the two spacecraft. MESSENGER, an artist's impression Meanwhile, Venus Express will continue its unprecedented study of this intriguing planet, ready for its next discoveries. As you read this, Venus is still bright in the evening sky. Venus Express, ESAâs first mission to Venus was launched on 9 November 2005 and reached the planet on 11 April 2006. NASAâs MESSENGER, launched on 3 August 2004, will fly by Venus for a second time on 6 June 2007 on its way to Mercury. It is expected to reach its destination in March 2011.

May 22 2007: 10:37 AM EDT NEW YORK (Reuters) -- Popular Internet social network MySpace said on Monday it reached an accord with eight U.S. state attorneys general and has worked out a legal mechanism to hand over information on convicted sex offenders found on its service. Last week, a coalition of U.S. law enforcement authorities criticized the (down $0.01 to $22.32, )-owned service for not divulging information from profiles of convicted sex offenders on MySpace. Law enforcement wants MySpace to turn over records of sex offenders. WSFB's Eric Parker Reports. (May 15) MySpace said it had identified, blocked and deleted about 7,000 such profiles, but had initially declined to hand over the information immediately, citing a disclosure law barring it from giving away the information without a court order. By last Wednesday, MySpace and the attorneys general group reached an agreement. MySpace officials said they had always intended to provide information to law enforcement officials, but were trying to work out a legal process for handing over the information. MySpace sued by families of sexually abused teens "When we remove individuals from our site, we always keep in mind the law enforcement aspect of it," MySpace Chief Security Officer Hemanshu Nigam said in an interview. MySpace and the attorneys general group, led by Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and North Carolina AG Roy Cooper, have worked out a system to hand over information to be used to pursue offenders, although that process could differ from state to state. "Each state has its own laws," Fox Interactive Media general counsel Mike Angus told Reuters. "It's an intricate web of laws that we make sure we comply with ... We don't want these guys walking out on a technicality." Blumenthal said he has been issued a subpoena for the information. "Our subpoena compels this information right away -- within hours not weeks, without delay -- because it is vital to protecting children," he said in a statement. "Social networking sites should not be playgrounds for predators." But some attorneys general urged the company to take more actions to protect minors. The Complete Layman's Guide to Cyber Safety "While conveying this information to us is a good first step, MySpace needs to do more, including implementing an effective age verification system that will make the site considerably safer," Ohio AG Marc Dann said in a statement. MySpace has come under legal scrutiny over the past year after some of its young members fell prey to adult predators posing as minors. The families of several teenage girls who said they were sexually assaulted by MySpace members sued the service in January for failing to protect its members. To protect its large audience of teenagers -- some as young as 14 years old -- MySpace late last year contracted background verification firm Sentinel Tech Holdings Corp. to develop the first national database of convicted sex offenders. MySpace uses the data to cross-reference against its own database of users and weed out predators. Disney launches a MySpace for preteens Previously, registries of offenders were only available on a state level, making it difficult to track and investigate known offenders. The new system, called Sentinel SAFE, launched on May 2. "We have zero tolerance for sex offenders," Angus said. "After spending a year meeting with AGs, we figured that if we were to move quickly, we had to build it ourselves."

Although the service has deleted the profiles from MySpace, information is collected in its database for law enforcement, Angus said.

At least stateside. | Berlind&#8217;s Testbed | ZDNet.com Under the hood of disruptive technologies Pick a blog category Dan & David Show For the Road Warrior Google Apps To-Do List ComputerWorld: Microsoft legislatively TKO&#8217;s open document formats. At least stateside. Posted by David Berlind @ 7:02 am this morning detailing how Microsoft has managed to score a technical knockout of open document formats ( necessarily the OpenDocument Format) in five out of six states. The story sheds a bit of light on how closely (and in some cases quickly) vendors are working with legislators to sway public policy. According to the story&#8230; In Texas, corporate lobbying was also behind both the creation and eventual demise of , a bill in favor of open formats. The bill&#8217;s sponsor, state Rep. , acknowledged that he became interested in the issue only after being approached by former political colleagues who now work for IBM&#8230;..[Microsoft] worked with him on initial drafts of the bill but then refused to sign off at the last moment. He said said Microsoft also hired a top local lobbying firm that went to the expense of bringing in witnesses from other states and countries&#8230;.. Then, in Oregon, where a similar bill regarding open formats was under consideration: &#8230;..&#8221;There was heavy opposition from a certain large software company in Redmond, Washington,&#8221; a spokesman for [Oregon] Rep. Peter Buckley said Friday. &#8220;But we don&#8217;t name names.&#8221; Buckley, a Democrat, sponsored the bill in the state legislature&#8230;. And in Florida, pretty much the same thing: would have required state agencies be able to receive documents in open formats but would not have automatically banned proprietary formats. Even so, Microsoft&#8217;s reaction was swift&#8230;..According to a story posted in late April on the Web site, Rep. Ed Homan, the Republican legislator from Tampa who tried to amend the bill, said that Microsoft lobbyists pressured committee members to yank the addition. &#8220;They were here lickety-split,&#8221; he told MarketWatch. The fact that vendors on both sides of the debate (main Sun and IBM in favor of open document legislation and Microsoft opposing) are so vigorously engaged in swaying policymakers gives you some idea of how incredibly important both see the issue in terms of long term strategy. However, the ComputerWorld barely scratches the surface of what&#8217;s going on in the bigger picture that could impact the long term outcome. For example, should companies (individually or collectively) that support the OpenDocument Format like Google start to make a dent in the marketshare of Microsoft Office (particularly now that it has put a stake in the ground when it comes to the #1 complaint about Web apps; the offline problem), then those would be far more impactful in terms of moving masses of users to different document formats (including government users, particulary if the economics were right) than any policymaking. Of course, Microsoft can&#8217;t be counted out there either. The company turned on a dime when it needed an Internet strategy in the mid-90&#8217;s and there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that it&#8217;s prepared to answer the Web app challenge (particularly from Google) when and if that challenge poses a serious threat (it doesn&#8217;t right now). Then, there&#8217;s the international scene where, depending on the country, American technology companies may get their day in court, but in the end, have far less political sway over the outcome.Â  For example, China, where they&#8217;re working on their own open document format. Proving that &#8220;public&#8221; policy can be a motivating factor for vendors like Microsoft, the company will apparently be supporting China&#8217;s Uniform Office Format (UOF) &#8212; a format that is likely to become a standard for productivity documents in that country. Earlier this year (in April), Sun chairman Scott McNealy called for a merger of the OpenDocument Format and the Uniform Office Format, but there&#8217;s been no news since then regarding such an effort.

Apple has repeatedly said it would unveil its first-ever cell phone this month, and last week at a conference sponsored by The Wall Street Journal agreed when asked if the roll-out date would be "the last day of June." Bloggers, analysts and other pundits have been picking iPhone dates for weeks, with June 11, June 15 and June 20 among the possible first-purchase days. The tag line at the end of each commercial sets the record straight: "Coming June 29." Presumably, the iPhone will be available in Apple and retail and online stores that day, and not simply ready for preorder. touting the iPhone have been posted to Apple's Web site. Dubbed "Never Been an iPod," "How To" and "Calamari," the 30-second ads promote the phone's music and video play, its basic operation, and the connection between seeing a giant squid in a movie playing on an iPhone and a hunger for calamari. While the ads are the first look the public has gotten of the iPhone in action, they also disclosed one additional fact: Buyers will be required to sign a two-year (or longer) contract with the phone's only wireless carrier, AT&T. Small print at the bottom of the screen at the end of each ad reads: "Use requires minimum new two-year activation plan." Two weeks ago, the blog claimed that AT&T account codes were clues that buyers could also sign up for pay-as-you-go plans. Apple's ads discount that option, at least for the iPhone launch.

This widely anticipated gadget, which combines three amazing products, a revolutionary mobile phone, a widescreen iPod with touch controls, and a breakthrough Internet communications device with desktop-class email, web browsing, maps, and searching, into one small and lightweight handheld device, is priced at $499 for 4-gigabyte model and $599 for an 8-gigabyte model, Apple said previously. Apple made its long-awaited entry into the cellphone world in January by launching its much-anticipated mobile phone, iPhone, at the annual Macworld conference and Expo in San Francisco. Apple's CEO and chief showman Steve Jobs had unveiled iPhone during his keynote speech at the Macworld conference. Cingular, the Atlanta-based leading wireless carrier and a unit of AT&T Inc., is Appleâs exclusive U.S. carrier partner for iPhone. On Sunday night the new iPhone ads showed off several of the gadget's features, including advanced media player functions along with its ability to take calls, the ability to manage Internet and media tasks, and the function of how to use Google Maps to find a restaurant. The commercials ended with the pronouncement that the combination cell phone will be available "Only on the new AT&T" and "Coming June 29." Of the three ads, one aired before a 7 p.m. broadcast of "7th Heaven" on the CW Television Network. Appleâs iPhone, which was touted as "revolutionary" by Jobs in the keynote, has a built-in camera, five hours of continuous talk time and 15 hours for playing music, and runs Safari Web browser and Apple's Macintosh operating system software. It has Bluetooth, a short-range wireless technology that supports wireless headsets or links to devices like printers, and can connect to the Internet wirelessly via Wi-Fi. Unlike the tiny multiple keys found on existing smart phones, Apple's iPhone has a single button and a 3.5-inch (9-cm) touch screen, and is larger than the iPod Nano. With a black front and silver back, the iPhone according to Apple is the thinnest smart phone in the market having thickness of 11.6 millimeters (0.5-inches). Last month, Apple said the regulators have given their stamp of approval to iPhone, allowing it to sell iPhone in the United States. The approval of FCC, which is an independent executive agency of the U.S. government established to regulate interstate and foreign communications in the public interest, is necessary before a manufacturer can sell a handset to consumers. After revolutionizing the personal computing with its Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, and digital media market with its most popular iPod, the Cupertino, California based Apple is ready to revolutionize the mobile market with its multifunctional device that has such potent qualities which make it potential for revolutionizing the handset industry.

Apple Keeps Mum June 01, 2007 | 6:36:35 PM By Wired News reporter Cyrus Farivar Apple has declined to explain why its new DRM-free music files are watermarked with users' names and e-mail addresses. brought the new ability to download tracks from EMI Records without copy protection. But the unprotected files are labeled with the buyer's details, leading some to wonder if Apple is appending the information as an anti-piracy measure. But Apple is remaining mum about its reasoning. An Apple spokesman suggested by e-mail that Wired News contact Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Jupiter Research who has been briefed about iTunes Plus. The Apple spokesman didn't respond to further requests for comment. Gartenberg said there are many reasons why Apple would want to tag music sold through the iTunes store. The information could be used as a proof of purchase, or to facilitate upgrades (songs previously bought through iTunes can be upgraded to higher fidelity versions for an extra 30 cents). The identifier could help identify songs missing from albums (iTunes offers a "complete album" feature), as well as to thwart piracy. "In terms of sharing files, you're not legally permitted to do that anyway," he said. "You weren't supposed to that in the first place. You've technically violated the service agreement. Just because you've taken away the locks on the doors doesn't mean you can walk into someone's house and walk away with the TV set." Meanwhile, eMusic, which also sells music without copyright protection, does not tag customers' purchases with any information that can be used to identify them. "We don't put any identifying info on our files," said Cathy Halgas Nevins, a spokesperson for eMusic. Still, that hasn't stopped privacy advocates from crying foul, especially because the identifying information isn't hidden or encrypted. "There's absolutely no reason that it had to be embedded, unencrypted and in the clear," said , a senior intellectual property attorney at the . "Some of the privacy problems, in light of this, is that anyone who steals an iPod that includes purchased iTunes music will now have the name and e-mail address of its rightful owner." However, it would appear that short of spamming the iPod owner, there doesn't seem to be any compelling reason to encrypt that data â except for privacy's own sake. It is highly unlikely that any meaningful harm in terms of identity theft or harassment would come to the person who had lost their iPod in the manner that von Lohmann describes. Nonetheless, he added that it would be very trivial for Apple to fix this problem by encrypting that information and "preserving any forensics value this might have." Still, both Gartenberg and von Lohmann agreed that it's likely that enterprising software developers would quickly develop a way to circumvent, strip or otherwise spoof this information on the newly unprotected iTunes tracks. "I'm also fully expecting that someone will build a tool that will change the name and e-mail address to Steve Jobs and stevejobs@apple.com," he said. "If there's one thing we've seen about the internet, [it's that] people are sometimes able to build tools that help themselves." I wonder, tho... Is it just in the ID3 tag? If so, you can just erase them yourself, so wouldn't that help? Jun 1, 2007 7:36:17 PM I wonder what % of people this will bother? I guess that I would not give a hoot...I do not use any Apple anything! Jun 1, 2007 7:43:07 PM It has always been there so why the big deal. Jun 1, 2007 7:52:03 PM DRM issues aside - this new version of itunes (7.2), for me at least, is a disaster. I paid to get my collection "upgraded" to the higher bit rate version of the songs. So far I have been unable to download anything more than 10% of any song before there is a session timeout. Furthermore iTunes is sucking up 100% of my CPU time during the download process - making the PC unusable for anything else during the process. I've had no such issues with previous iTunes versions on either my network (Cable Modem) connection or CPU usage. Something is amiss with either this iTunes release or the iTunes servers. Jun 1, 2007 8:33:29 PM Kohana - It's not in the ID3 tag. In fact, AAC tracks don't do ID3 at all. They use MPEG-4 Atoms. The two atoms that everyone is droning on about are 'name', which contains your real name and 'user' which contains your iTMS account information. And to the Wired people writing these articles, welcome to four years ago. People figured out that iTMS tracks have your username and name embedded in them literally days after the store initially opened. The HYMN Project, the number one tool for quite some time when it came to stripping an iTMS track's DRM, didn't remove these atoms by default. Would people *please* stop acting like this is a new discovery? Jun 1, 2007 9:06:37 PM Good! Theyâll know where to return it. I know people who engrave their email address on the back. Now when the stolen iPod is recovered, I can prove its mine. Its not like the meth addict who stole it is going to need my email address, they already have it. Jun 1, 2007 9:07:53 PM What if someone steals an iPod full of iTunes purchased music with the name and email address of the rightful owner and then gives away or sells the files on the web? This is hardly an effective way to thwart piracy. Or are we going to have to report our iPods stolen to Apple or the RIAA now? Jun 1, 2007 9:36:32 PM I had pretty much the same thing happen to me as Marc Gunter, although my CPU processing power wasn't being sucked up. The first attempt I got to a whopping 1.1MB off a 10.1MB file. It took awhile but through restarting the download again and again it eventually finished. Jun 1, 2007 10:36:55 PM Yah, my iTunes Plus "upgrades" have been problematic, as well. I'm guessing they're working on the problem. As for the embedded information being a privacy issue, get real already. When Apple implements security (ie. DRM), people complain. When they take it away, people complain, supposedly because now the song files can be played by anyone, so that would enable the potential of personally-tagged to spread far and wide. I'm guessing that is what people are afraid of. Give a song to someone and you fear they may share it online. That's a risk you must take if you're going to share your songs in the first place. The nature of the beast. Apple is not responsible for the songs once they leave their servers. That's the end-user's responsibility. Let me say that again... responsibility. People get confused about that and freedom of speech. Silly. Jun 2, 2007 12:00:25 AM What's the big deal? Your privacy is a big deal. Do you really want people to know that you actually paid for a [insert crappy artist's name here] song? What about people knowing you paid to downloading a lecture about Marxism. What if people want to use this type of information against you? Jun 2, 2007 1:21:05 AM This only proves to me the general public is a big horde of narcisictic morons....You wanted DRM-free, you got it.,..Buut you are still not happy, so now you whine and bitch about something else... Man, I would hate to be musician nowadays...All this a-holes want you to work for free. Jun 2, 2007 3:36:37 AM "When Apple implements security (ie. DRM), people complain. When they take it away, people complain" DRM is not security. It's a method to stop people distributing files/information without the rights to do it, thus Digital Rights Management. Jun 2, 2007 4:41:21 AM Your privacy isn't a problem if you don't illegally distribute purchases to people you don't know through P2P apps, now is it? Yes, this is really old news, and should have been the original solution to piracy (as opposed to DRM). It doesn't infringe on the rights of the purchaser, but it ties a purchase directly to the purchased item so that if someone does engage illegal redistribution of the product, the copyright owner has a name and address of the person they need to sue. The only people that suffer are those who actually violated the law.

Jun 2, 2007 8:30:37 AM By your pro Apple replies I see many of you subscribe to the Orwellian world where a kids iPod gets stolen and the songs wind up on some Napster site that it's OK for the RIAA to sue her grandmother into the street because it's better to prosecute etn innocent people than to let one guilty one get off without punishment. Welcome to the land of guilty until proven innocent and only then for those with cash to burn on lawyers. Enjoy your new world - we'll be installing monitor cams in every room of your house tomorrow. Relax it's what you wanted!! Jun 2, 2007 9:33:42 AM interesting some people gave out their real names... and cry about privacy... the solution to privacy on the internet is to not to try to hide your privacy. THat looks like you got something. Just don't proclaim it either. If you email me, microsoft will give you my real name addy and phone number on an "electronic contact card". I freely give that information out because I only email my friends. That and I'm big and ugly so no need to worry about stalkers and if you want my credit debt enjoy. Basically, the internet is no different then the real world in the fact of theft, or your name getting around. Mike at the bar is a marine. He lives near staunton and he likes miller light. If I wanted more info I could get it easily and the only way I can get it is to research and put work into it, like stalking. However, Mike is safe, I'm lazy and he's boring. So here's to apple and microsoft... May you figure out what linux already has *cheers* Jun 2, 2007 10:03:55 AM Anyone who defends DRM is an industry shill and should be ignored. Jun 2, 2007 10:05:50 AM @Marc "Your privacy isn't a problem if you don't illegally distribute purchases to people you don't know through P2P apps, now is it?" That's utter nonsense, there are more ways for you property (songs) to escape from your ownership than and your control over them than you putting them on a P2P. Like your mp3 player being stolen, being lost, someone copying your files without permission... In some cases you might not even know this had happened, if someone is snooping on your wireless network when you are downloading a song they might put it up on a P2P and you'd never know, until the lawyers came knocking. After all it's not like there can only possibly be a single copy of each file in existence, see my point below. @Alexander B "You would'nt go into a house and STEAL their tv set, but I am sure the owner of the tv set would'nt mind if you looked at it and made your own version of it." A TV set is a tangible object with a significant material and monetary cost in replication, information, particularly digital information, is not, it has a near zero cost of replication, that is why people can publish a blog for no personal cost that is read by millions of people, but they can't do the same in physical print. Jun 2, 2007 10:08:06 AM @ Oli "A TV set is a tangible object with a significant material and monetary cost in replication, information, particularly digital information, is not, it has a near zero cost of replication, that is why people can publish a blog for no personal cost that is read by millions of people, but they can't do the same in physical print." So, by your argument I'm to conclude that intellectual property has no value until it's transmogrified into a tangible object? That's so 19th century. Jun 2, 2007 10:51:45 AM hmmm m4p , current version of aac mpeg4 used by itunes can be still converted, any trace removed, then shared to web, so what's the story here ? atoms will not go along in mp3/wma whatever format, other mp3 players use, so , put a sock on it EMI/Apple tagging is for kids and baggages not to get lost on the way home :) Jun 2, 2007 11:52:46 AM Err, no, but data and a physical object are not directly comparable. I was not suggesting that the data had no value, merely that the cost of creating a second version of data is negligible. I can understand the point Alexander B is trying to make but using a physical object as the example isn't appropriate (not really his fault as Michael Gartenberg invoked the comparison in the first place). Jun 2, 2007 12:06:08 PM This isn't NEW at all. Purchased music from iTunes have had this information in them all along. And it's not secret, as it shows up if you do a get info in iTunes. Jun 2, 2007 12:11:50 PM Bithc Bitch Bitch! Look, personally I find the watermarking a GREAT altertative to DRM! The lack of DRM allows people to play the files on devices other than iPod. If you want watermark free, DRM free files, Rip them yourselves! Keep in mind you do not HAVE to purchase your music from the iTunes store, or from iTunes Plus! Personally I do not purchase any music from any online service that uses DRM. I show my lack if interest in DRM with my DOLLARS! If you do not like it, then DO NOT USE IT! Jun 2, 2007 12:31:36 PM "So, by your argument I'm to conclude that intellectual property has no value until it's transmogrified into a tangible object? That's so 19th century." The value of property is not equal to reproduction costs. Numerous factors affect the value of tangible objects also, such as supply and demand, and the price the owner chooses to sell it at. Jun 2, 2007 3:09:55 PM Some odf the previous posters have missed the point somewhat I feel. No it's anot a new thing for apple to encode users name and email address into files bought off itunes. What is new however is being able to read them on computers that dont belong to that person. Previously if someone stole your ipod they couldn't read the name and email address from the itunes songs stored on it, because the computer they connected it to would not have the DRM key required to unencrypt the files, including that data. Now with unencrypted files being sold, it's freely viewable to all. Just another valid reason not to use iTunes or AAC in my view. MP3 still remains the strongest format in terms of sharing, compatibility and privacy. Jun 2, 2007 3:19:33 PM Question from a slightly different angle for those in the know. Isn't fingerprinting still DRM? Isn't it totally misleading for EMI/Apple to suggest that the iTunes+ songs are DRM-free? Jun 2, 2007 3:30:52 PM I look at this crying privacy concerns the same way I look at people crying racism. If you would just stop doing it, people would stop caring! So your name is on the track, WHOOPDIE F***ING DOO!! Jun 2, 2007 4:44:57 PM Robert, depends on your personal definition of DRM. The commonly accepted definition however is, that DRM is something that will technically keep you from playing a media file, if you can't prove you legitimation to do so. This is definitely not the case with fingerprinting. What I really find irritating is the fact, that more and more people (like Paul`) seem to accept, that the publisher's rights on of a piece of intellectual property naturally outperform the rights of a buyer to treat what he bought to his linkings. This IS a typical case where balancing of eligible rights is required. As Tavis Veighey has put it: Vote with your bucks. If you don't like it, don't buy it. That's one of the reasons why I still buy vinyl records (although not the most important one). Jun 2, 2007 4:46:23 PM Er, Sean, stop doing WHAT exactly? Jun 2, 2007 4:48:29 PM People. This discussion fails to see the forest for the trees. Concerns about privacy for a friggin' song. What did you use to buy it? What's that? A credit card is how. You trust your credit card company? Hmmmmm. Every purchase you've ever made for every product with that credit card is kept on file. Getting that information is rather trivial. A song has your name on it (and can be easily removed), and you cry as though your rights have been violated; meanwhile, you happily hand your credit cards to store clerks, waiters, etc. and take it up the ass. Jun 2, 2007 6:17:39 PM The problem I have with iTunes' DRM-free files is this: DRM is intended to prevent you from giving away music, thus taking income away from the artist. However, for an extra $0.30, that noble cause goes right out the window, proving that it wasn't all that necessary in the first place. If discouraging piracy were the primary purpose of DRM, then the situation should be exactly the opposite of what it is now (lower quality files DRM-free, higher quality files protected), because higher quality files make better quality bootlegs. But no one would pay for a better quality product if there were greater restrictions on it's use. This whole iTunes Plus business is a marketing scam intended solely to coax a few more cents out of your pocket. I'm sure Apple is quietly pressuring digital music player manufacturers to build devices that rely on embedded file info matching a pre-entered user ID in order to play them. Convert the file to a format where the info disappears and oops, now it won't play. The music industry is focused on finding new ways to make you pay again for things you've already paid for. Don't ever forget that. Jun 2, 2007 8:12:25 PM bp has it correct, it's all about your information being put on display. Think about tjx compromise.200 million compromised ought to know Jun 2, 2007 9:04:13 PM The successful prosecution of someone for violating copyright by sharing a file on the web will take more than just the watermarking of the name of the purchaser, it will require proof that the purchaser was the one who actually shared it and not just someone who stole it from the original purchaser. Its not guilty until proven innocent, its just a good starting point for an investigation. Its the same with a registered gun used in a crime. Just because it was registered to the original purchaser, doesn't necessarily mean that person committed the crime and certainly isn't enough evidence by itself to convict them of that crime. It just gives the police a good starting point in their investigation. No its not DRM. DRM is digital rights management. DRM actively attempts to control access to the digital property. There's no software or hardware scheme attempting to control access to the music purchased in watermarking or fingerprinting. Jun 2, 2007 9:09:14 PM "In terms of sharing files, you're not legally permitted to do that anyway," he said. "You weren't supposed to that in the first place. You've technically violated the service agreement." Does anybody else think it is funny that there are options under at least two setting tabs concerning sharing your library? Jun 2, 2007 11:05:41 PM Like so many others have already stated, the watermarking has been in place since iTunes Music Store's inception. And it's not like there aren't utilities out here on the ZOMGINTARWEBZ that will allow you to convert a m4p file to mp3 (so long as you have a legitimate license to the file), which doesn't support the AAC atoms and therefore wipes out the info. In fact, even though i purchase alot of my music from iTunes simply because it's convenient, i typically convert it to mp3 format, mainly because i tend to always be upgrading my computers and after the fifth time i have to reinstall the OS, i would be out of licenses for the crap DRM and unable to play the music i paid for thereafter. After it's converted to mp3, you'll be able to import your files BACK into the m4p format, and you won't have to worry about your personal information being visible to the public. A pain in the ass to do it that way, i know, but if you're that worried about it, there are ways to avoid it. Note that the article also identifies eMusic as a DRM/fingerprint-free online music retailer, and you can easily import their mp3's to iTunes, which will convert them to the AAC format that your iPod uses. Without personal information. Jun 2, 2007 11:44:04 PM I really don't see what all the fuss is about. Apple is really trying to listen to it's buyers by selling DRM free music but remember that they still have record labels and artists breathing down there neck trying to sue them for not using DRM. Puting your name and your email address in your file is no different then the fact that they have your email address in their server. So to the people who are complaining "what if my ipod gets stolen" I say to you what if someone steals their server? What if your wallet or purse gets stolen? I'm sure there are credit cards with your info on it but we are not complaining to the credit card companies. How many people have complained that you can put contact information on other people in your ipod? It's like the saying goes, "give a guy 3 inches he wants four, give him five he wants six". I am rather pleased that apple has taken away DRM from some of their music. I takes care of the problem that certain formats only play on certain devices. No DRM, problem solved, change the format. As for my email address and name being in the file, I don't plan to give it to anyone else let them buy their own as I did, and if my ipod gets lost or stolen I say "better my ipod then my wallet". Jun 3, 2007 12:57:20 AM you really think a company would be dumb enough to sue apple and risk apple not putting their music in the itunes store? Although Apple is not the only online market for music it is by far the most popular and most easy to use with the top selling portable media player the ipod. In reality they hold all the cards and if they say otherwise they are just playing the other companies as scapegoats. Jun 3, 2007 2:00:55 AM I totally welcome any anti-piracy measure that is not DRM. Jun 3, 2007 6:48:35 AM I'm really getting sick of the EEF. They complain when the information is available, as in the case with the name and email address of DRM-free iTunes tracks. But they would have complained just as loudly if the information had been encrypted. With the exception of your iPod being stolen, if you're not doing something wrong with the music you don't have anything to worry about. Even if your iPod was stolen, having your name and email address is not that big of a deal, it's not like it's your birthdate and social security number. So quit complaining about it, being able to do what you want (legally) with the music is a much better alternative than DRM was!

You make Apple sound like the Mafia. This is a very submissive comment you made on behalf of property owners. I took the liberty of posting some excerpts for you below, with the authors of them following, just to help educate you some. Not everyone is willing to give up their rights or make Apples life easy in fear of Apple... "iTunes under lawsuit fire: A Jerry Garcia collaborator has charged Apple with copyright violation. Bluegrass musician David Grisman, who heads up Dawg Music with his business partner Craig Miller, claims that the iTunes Store sells his songs without adequately compensating him.

I opened a itunes plus song with text edit, typed in my apple id, hit find, and there it was. Someone could probably make some kind of applescript or something to change it in a lot of files at once. Jun 3, 2007 4:46:02 PM I'm in your mp3z Jun 3, 2007 5:21:47 PM People will never be happy with this stuff... if it has DRM, we want it DRM-Free, if it's DRM-Free, why the hell is it much more expensive, I don't care if it's because it takes more bandwith or anything, it shouldn't be more expensive. If it's AAC it should be OGG or FLAC or some other lossless, go figure. So, your email and your name are there? The only scenario is, as someone above me wrote, is if your iPod gets stolen. Now, please someone correct me if I'm wrong, but... it's almost next to impossible (except with some other tools) to bring out a correctly named MP3/M4P/AAC from an ipod, you have to go into hidden folders and the such... who is going to bother with that just to see who they stole the ipod from? These "privacy concerns" are too paranoic, I think...then again, most of us ARE paranoid. That's what government has taught us to do and that's how we are now. Relax...it's your music inside your computer/ipod/favorite MP3 player. Jun 3, 2007 6:44:37 PM i just wonder how many people that are really worried about DRM and are gonna share music anyway havent heard about this site....? SCREW APPLE Jun 3, 2007 7:05:34 PM sometimes when i share headphones with a friend on the train, i take a look around to make sure there are no riaa police riding with us... sounds like a few of them posted comments here sure, the electronics age has appropriately transformed our ideas of consumer rights, but let's not discard them completely in favor of the (false) notion that we're stealing from the pocket of the musician when we make our totally hot potential girlfriend a compilation disc of cheesy love songs i think the bottom line is that apple doesn't really gain anything by fingerprinting the files, except to pacify its riaa cronies and piss off consumers... if i had to choose one to piss off, i would've chosen the other i use emusic... it's okay... itunes is dead. long live itunes! Jun 3, 2007 10:16:09 PM Didn't anyone stop to think that if someone stole your iPod all they need do is look at your address book and see your name, address, phone no., email accounts, and that of all your friends, relatives, contacts, etc. No need to even try to look for that info in the music. Some of you are really extremely paranoid. Or are you worried about some illegal music sharing you want to do? Go buy the CD and rip your own tracks if you are so friggin paranoid and let me go back to enjoying my DRM free music. Jun 4, 2007 6:59:04 AM What I'm suprised about is that no one seems to understand that they don't *have* to watermark the songs with personally identifing information. Since the name and email address are just used to track the song against the account information Apple could have *easily* used a hash function like SHA1 to obscure the contents. They'd still be able to match a song to the account it came from by matchng hashes. They wouldn't have had to disclose *any* information and they would have been able to track the songs *just* as well. Why didn't they do this? Is there some technical reason or did they just get lazy, stupid, or nefarious? Jun 4, 2007 8:34:01 AM I'd never considered purchasing from iTunes due to DRM. I like to remix and edit tracks and DRM put an extra few steps in the process. (Burn to disc then rip from the disc. Voila no DRM.) I don't have a problem with watermarking. Other sites selling DRM free music have been doing it for years. It's just an attempt at traceability. What I do have a problem with is paying more for a track that isn't lossless or at the very least available in 320kbps MP3. I'll continue to buy CDs for "name" bands and get independents through emusic for far less than .99 a track. You get what you pay for.

Jun 4, 2007 10:28:47 AM honestly I wouldn't use i tunes if my life depended upon it. I mean sure if I was in the business of waisting space on my computer and if I wanted a program where I could not take off songs from my i pod I guess i tunes would be my first choice. Real Player is far superior to i tunes. and if your all so worried about the file sharing with tags use lime wire for god sakes.

The study found that worldwide revenue from standalone OSS reached $1.8 billion in 2006. This revenue will climb to $5.8 billion in 2011, representing a compound annual growth rate of 26 per cent from 2006 to 2011, IDC predicted. IDC defined standalone OSS as being distributed or sold on its own, rather than being embedded in or sold as a complementary offering with other software. The degree of expected growth for OSS shouldn't be surprising for those who have been watching adoption increase over the last few years, according to Matt Lawton, Toronto-based program director of Open Source Software Business Models research program. "That kind of growth is easier to obtain when...adoption of open source software is starting to take hold in a commercial environment that is looking to pay for subscriptions, support around that software and other services." Adoption has climbed as recognition and acceptance of Linux as a "prime and leading example of open source software" has grown, said Lawton. But in the last year or two, OSS activity has moved up the software stack, reaching the application deployment and development tools arena. The JBoss Application Server, developed by the Red Hat-sponsored open source middle community JBoss.org, is a good example, Lawton said. OSS has climbed even higher up the stack into the realm of applications such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM). "We're starting to see that vendors are producing (OSS apps), a community is developing around them, and customers are starting to adopt them," he said. Leading examples of OSS apps include SugarCRM, webERP, ERP5 as well as Compiere, an integrated ERP/CRM solution. Even though OSS growth is projected to be healthy in the coming years, revenues will continue to lag behind distribution. "It's the nature of open source software," Lawton said. It's free to download the code and run it, and if you pay for anything, it's for professional support. But many people using OSS don't need the support, or are just trying it out for now. A certain portion of users will eventually convert into paying customers, "but there is a lag when it comes to how long that takes," he said. A number of barriers to OSS adoption still exist. There has been a lot of publicity around the "viral nature of the GPL (general public license)" -- a reference to the GPL's stipulation that if any GPL code is included in another program, the entire program becomes subject to the terms of the GPL, which include not being able to restrict the use, copying, modification or redistribution of that software. Some organizations are worried about being sued for license violations or patent infringement if GPL code finds its way into the software they are using. But a number of vendors have offered indemnification around those issues. "This is causing concern in the IT user community that vendors will need to address further, to give (customers) the comfort they need to embrace open source software more fully," Lawton said. License proliferation is also an issue, creating some confusion in the marketplace, Lawton said. "End users have to work extra hard to do an analysis on the licenses before they have the assurance that a particular software is safe to adopt, or before they know what they are committing to." But probably the biggest adoption barrier would be the perception that there is a lack of professional support around OSS, Lawton noted. When choosing which OSS to adopt, companies should look at the community surrounding it, which should not only have developers but other end users that are helping with things like testing and documentation, Lawton said. "You need to look at how well developed and how broad the community is so that you're not locked into a small community that may not survive or reach critical mass." It's also important to look at the vendor and partner ecosystem to gauge what level of professional support is available, he added. Channel partners will find opportunities in the OSS space as they reach out to a whole new set of customers, Lawton said. Partners will likely have to provide more services than what they traditionally would offer with proprietary software, and will not rely as heavily on the resale of licenses for their revenue.

Kearney: Competitive Differentiation Through Oracle Secure Enterprise Search Security Beyond Today: Layered security for addressing fraud today...and adapting to tomorrow Endpoint Data Protection Benchmark Report from Aberdeen Group Maximizing Site Visitor Trust Using Extended Validation SSL Our Hottest Security Tips Sign up to receive Security Resource Alerts (IDG News Service) -- Microsoft Corp. has signed another Linux distributor to a patent licensing and collaboration deal similar to the one it struck with Xandros Inc., which offers desktop and server versions of Linux, has agreed to license Microsoft intellectual property (IP), said , senior vice president of the server and tools business at Microsoft. He dropped the news in the middle of a keynote today at the company's TechEd 2007 conference in Orlando. Muglia shed little light on specific details of the agreement, saying only that it follows the same model as the Linux and Windows interoperability and licensing deal Microsoft struck with Novell last year. "Xandros has taken a license to our intellectual property," he said. "They've taken the position of helping customers to ensure that when they use open-source software, the IP the industry has created is a part of that." from the companies offered more details, confirming that the deal includes "covenants" to protect customers using Xandros software from any potential patent-infringement claims from Microsoft. Microsoft said recently that it would aggressively seek royalties for patents it says it holds in open-source technologies such as Linux. The company acknowledged that instead of going to court, it would rather sign backroom patent and cross-licensing deals with open-source distributors. Muglia acknowledged that in the past year, Microsoft has stepped up efforts to ensure that its products are interoperable with competitive offerings, and he noted that working with the open-source community has been a big part of that. "Over the last year, you've seen Microsoft take a number of steps that ... demonstrate a change of approach for us," he said. "You've seen partnerships you might not have expected Microsoft to be a part of." He mentioned partnerships with , Novell and JBoss.org as examples of the company's new attitude. In addition to the licensing component, the five-year deal between Xandros and Microsoft also will include collaboration between the companies to make their Microsoft System Center and Xandros Systems Management products more interoperable. Xandros also will join the efforts to standardize and use WS-Management Web services protocols, which Microsoft supports. As part of the deal, Xandros will license Microsoft server communications protocols so Xandros Server will work better with in IT systems. The company also will join the effort to build translators between rival document formats Open Document Format for Office Applications, an international standard favored by open-source companies, and Open XML, Microsoft's default format in Finally, Microsoft will endorse Xandros desktop and server Linux operating systems as the "preferred" distribution for its customers, and company engineers will be trained to support the software to help channel partners offer both Microsoft and Xandros software.

Monday, June 04, 2007 Posted by Erik Larkin Microsoft Cuts Patent Deal With Xandros Linux Shortly after declaring that Linux and other open-source software violates 235 Microsoft patents , Redmond today jointly announced a collaboration agreement with Xandros Linux. Among other things, the agreement will provide "intellectual property assurance," with Microsoft offering patent covenants for Xandros customers. According to the announcement , "these covenants will provide customers with confidence that the Xandros technologies they use and deploy in their environments are compliant with Microsofts intellectual property." The companies aren't disclosing the financial arrangements of the partnership, or the patents covered by the agreement. Novell in May announced details of its November deal with Microsoft , which likewise offers patent assurances for Novell Linux customers. Aside from patents, the Xandros agreement will also focus on systems management and server interoperability, Office document compatibility, and Microsoft sales and marketing support. If you're a Linux user and are wondering whether these patent machinations mean that Redmond is going to send you a bill, PC World's Matthew Newton says you can stop worrying .

You don't make a better product; instead you simply buy up the competition or sue them to death. How marvellous for the customers. In a related announcement, the newest operating system by Mircrosoft has been released. It combines features of both VISTA and LINUX and will be called VISUX. Once again money prevails!!!! Hey Redmound go jump off a cliff. Do something yourselves for once. I can just imagine the staff meating: "Say can we get away with the same old story again????" . Just curl up and die already!

Under the terms of the agreement, New York-based Xandros, which makes and distributes open-source desktop and server software, will license server code from Microsoft and develop software tools that work with Microsoft's systems. The companies also will work on technology to translate between two types of documents, Microsoft-developed OpenXML format and the Open Document Format. That could improve interoperability between Microsoft's Office software and open-source rivals. Microsoft also said in a statement it will endorse Xandros Server and Desktop programs as a preferred Linux distribution. Key to the agreement is a clause that protects Xandros customers from running afoul of Microsoft's legal machine for patent infringement. A growing number of companies and government agencies rely on elements of both Microsoft's Windows and various versions of Linux to run their office networks, but fear being sued by the software maker, which claims open-source software infringes on hundreds of its patents. Financial terms of the arrangement weren't disclosed. The Linux server software segment is dominated by Red Hat Inc. and Novell Inc.; Xandros' share of that worldwide market is so small that research group IDC doesn't track it. Xandros captured less than 1 percent of the desktop Linux operating system market in 2006, according to IDC, far behind big players like Red Flag Software Co., based in China, and Turbolinux Inc. in Japan. The deal with Xandros is similar to one Microsoft struck with Novell last November. It sparked considerable outcry from some open-source programmers, who make all of their code - and any software that includes their code - available without charge to users and other developers. Free software proponents argued that under the public license governing Novell's code, Microsoft must give up patent claims on its software if it makes exceptions for some customers. In a May filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Novell noted that Microsoft could conceivably back out of the deal to avoid extending its patent covenants to a broader range of recipients.

The bills called for the use of standards and open document formats in desktop software. A number of European governments have adopted Open Document Format (ODF) as the standard for electronic documents from productivity applications. Microsoft's rival Open XML format has been certified as an Ecma standards and is now being considered by the International Standards Organization. Apart from the high-profile case of Massachusetts, U.S. states have not adopted policies that mandate the use of standard, open document formats. Marino Marcich, the managing director of lobbying group the , said that bills in Florida, Oregon and Texas did not come up for vote in committee. A California bill he characterized as a "work in progress" while Minnesota's bill was altered to study the issue of open documents. Massachusetts has continued to stick with its policy of mandating standard document formats for executive branch offices; it said last year that it intends to use a that will allow Microsoft Office to work with documents and the OpenDocument format. The call for standards and desktop applications has spread to governments around the world, in part because of the standardization and growing viability of OpenDocument. The process has been marked by by Microsoft and IBM, which backs OpenDocument, at the government level. Despite the derailing of the state bills, Marcich said he expects discussion around open formats at states will be common in a few years, driven by either legislative action or executive policy. click here to start it Recent posts from News Blog Shutterstock photogs to get press credentials Olympus camera housings cater to the wet set Feds footing the bill for municipal broadband?

Worldwide Open Source Revenues To Hit $5.8 Billion: IDC Worldwide Open Source Revenues To Hit $5.8 Billion: IDC Growth in revenue, however, will lag behind the growth in distribution of open source software. (Monday, June 04, 2007 10:26:08 AM) Growth in revenue, however, will lag behind the growth in distribution of open source software. Monday, June 04, 2007: A new study from IDC reveals the market for standalone open source software (OSS) is in a significant growth stage. Adoption of OSS will accelerate over the forecast period of 2007 through 2011 as barriers to adoption get knocked down. IDC says worldwide revenue from standalone open source software reached $1.8 billion in 2006 and will reach $5.8 billion in 2011, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26 per cent from 2006 to 2011. "We are in the early stages of the development and deployment of OSS," said Matt Lawton, programme director, Open Source Software Business Models research programme, IDC. "The market is still quite immature, especially now that we see active open source projects in all layers of the software stack." He added, "Although we see healthy growth in revenue from standalone open source software, we must keep in mind that revenue will substantially lag behind the distribution of open source software. Many distributions of standalone open source software are free, while paid distributions typically are based on pay-as-you-go subscriptions rather than pay-up-front licence fees." IDC's study shows that the drivers for OSS adoption, and in particular commercial adoption of OSS, include increased customer interest in OSS as customers realise that OSS provides them with more choice and leverage with proprietary software vendors. In addition, more financial backing from venture capitalists, more comfort with subscription revenue as a business model, and increased interest in OSS within larger enterprise organisations are helping to accelerate the OSS adoption rate. Software vendors are advised to consider several factors when evaluating how best to leverage open source software as a business opportunity, including the most appropriate business model, the appropriate usage of partnerships and alliances, and the characteristics of the community supporting the open source software. (Monday, June 04, 2007 10:26:08 AM) Growth in revenue, however, will lag behind the growth in distribution of open source software.

In a series of ads aired on 60 Minutes in the US last night, the California-based company revealed the launch date, ending months of speculation about when one of the most anticipated products would come to market." /> Apple to launch US iPhone on June 29-News-Tech & Web-TimesOnline Best of the weekend, from The Times and The Sunday Times Navigation - link to other main sections from here We instinctively reject the doctrine of multiculturalism Apple to launch US iPhone on June 29 Apple has ended speculation about the release of its long-awaited iPhone in America but no date set for Europe Apple has confirmed that it will release its long-awaited iPhone on June 29 in the US. In a series of ads aired on 60 Minutes in the US last night, the California-based company revealed the launch date, ending months of speculation about when one of the most anticipated products would come to market. The device, which combines the functions of phone, media player and PDA, will sell in two versions - costing $499 and $599 respectively - depending on the memory capacity, and be available only on one network, AT&T. No advice was given about when iPhone would be released in Europe. show a user demonstrating the phone's most innovative features, in particular the touchscreen, which will used to turn the phone on in a sliding motion, and scroll through the owner's music collection and e-mail. At one point the owner interrupts watching Pirates of the Caribbean because he fancies eating calamari, and uses Google Maps to track down a seafood restaurant in San Fransisco, which he then rings, all in a series of seamless gestures. The three ads end with the Hollywood-esque lines: "Only on the new AT&T" and "Coming June 29". Since Apple released details of the product at a conference in San Fransisco in January, the iPhone has been the subject of feverish hype, but some analysts remained sceptical, pointing out that it was not the only smartphone to use a touchscreen, and that it had the potential to cannibalise the iPod market The network it used was not 3G, which would reduce the speed of certain functions, they said, and it remained to be seen to what extent Apple would open up the iPhone platform to developers wanting to write new applications. "If you look at smartphones, one of the things that broadens their appeal the most is an open platform so that new features can be added," Paul O'Donovan, an analyst with Gartner said. "By far the most important new feature in phones in the next little while will be location-based services using GPS, but I doubt Apple has the capacity to do that in-house." When he introduced the iPhone in January, Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive, seemed reluctant to allow outside developers create software for the device, but at a conference last week he appeared to have changed his mind, saying that the company was looking for ways to work with outside parties. Apple has said it wants to capture 1 per cent of the phone market with the device, and has set a goal of selling 10 million iPhones by the end of next year - a target many analysts think will be easily reached. News reports from Asia suggest that the company has recently placed an order for 5 million more iPhones with Quanta, the Taiwanese laptop manufacturer, to begin shipping in September. The initial contract to make the iPhone was reportedly won by Hon Hai, another Taipai-based manufacturer. I think the nerds in America and elsewhere should GROW UP and act like adults.

While there, she will be allowed outside her cell &#8220;for an hour each day to shower, watch television in the day room , participate in outdoor recreation or talk on the telephone.&#8221; Today on Fox News&#8217;s morning show Fox and Friends, the hosts noted that Hilton will not be allowed to speak on her cell phone while in jail. Guest host Greg Kelly then commented, &#8220;It sounds like Abu Ghraib. C&#8217;mon, that&#8217;s not cool.&#8221; Watch it: may be part of the , but it is not like being at Abu Ghraib. From a New York Times article, &#8220;He handcuffed me to the door for eight hours and the next day I had a dislocated shoulder and they took me to the hospital,&#8221; he said. Specialist Graner watched as another soldier urinated on Mr. Al-Sheikh, the detainee testified, and Specialist Graner made another detainee eat from a toilet. He threatened to rape them and their wives, and made them eat pork and make statements against their Muslim faith , Mr. Al-Sheikh said. CAMEROTA: Listen to what she&#8217;s looking at in jail. She is going to be treated supposedly like all other prisoners. She&#8217;s gonna have a cell to herself. She&#8217;s going to have to eat in her cell. There you see her in her cell. KELLY: Is that the outfit she gets? CAMEROTA: No, it&#8217;s actually going to be an orange jump suite. DOOCY: She looks good in stripes. CAMEROTA: And she&#8217;s gonna get an hour outside of her cell each day where she can shower, she can watch TV in the community room, she can participate in outdoor recreation. But here is what&#8217;s going to hurt her the most, you guys. CAMEROTA: She cannot speak on her cell phone. DOOCY: Are you kidding me? CAMEROTA: It is surgically attached to her ear.

How is my relationship with Harry Reid? Well, it&#8217;s better than my with Pat Leahy. (Laughter.) But I won&#8217;t go into that.&#8221; We need more 9/11 attacks to appreciate Bush. Arkansas GOP chief Dennis Milligan: &#8220;At the end of the day, I believe fully the president is doing the right thing, and I think all we need is some attacks on American soil like we had on [September 11] , and the naysayers will come around very quickly to appreciate not only the commitment for President Bush, but the sacrifice that has been made by men and women to protect this country.&#8221; Speaker Pelosi on Jefferson&#8217;s indictments: &#8220;The charges in the indictment against Congressman Jefferson are extremely serious. While Mr. Jefferson, just as any other citizen, must be considered innocent until proven guilty, if these charges are proven true, they constitute an egregious and unacceptable abuse of public trust and power. As we have demonstrated in implementing tough ethics reforms and passing tough lobbying reforms already this year, Democrats are committed to upholding a high ethical standard and eliminating corruption and unethical behavior from the Congress.&#8221; Griffin Altered NASA Mission Statement To Remove Global Warming Reference Last week, NPR asked NASA administrator Michael Griffin said that while he was &#8220;aware that global warming exists,&#8221; he wasn&#8217;t sure whether it &#8220; is a longterm concern or not. &#8221; Griffin said he is &#8220;not sure that it is fair to say that it is a problem we must wrestle with.&#8221; Griffin subsequently clarified his remarks, stating that protecting the earth against global warming is not in the agency&#8217;s mission statement The agency is responsible for collecting data that is used by the science community and policy makers as part of an ongoing discussion regarding our planet&#8217;s evolving systems. It is NASA&#8217;s responsibility to collect, analyze and release information. It is not NASA&#8217;s mission to make policy regarding possible climate change mitigation strategies But from 2002-2006, it was. Part of NASA&#8217;s mission was to &#8220; protect our home planet To understand and protect our home planet ; to explore the universe and search for life; to inspire the next generation of explorers &#8230; as only NASA can. In Feb. 2006, the mission statement was &#8220; &#8221; to remove the phrase &#8220;to understand and protect our home planet.&#8221; Even a year ago, NASA scientists predicted that because of the mission statement revision, there would &#8220;be far less incentive to pursue projects to improve understanding of terrestrial problems like climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions.&#8221; Top NASA climatologist James Hansen called the deletion &#8220; ,&#8221; because he had &#8220;been using the phrase since December 2005 to justify speaking out about the dangers of global warming.&#8221; In contrast to the previous mission statement, the 2006 revision &#8220;was made at NASA headquarters without consulting the agency&#8217;s 19,000 employees or informing them ahead of time.&#8221; Instead, it was submitted as part of the 2006 Earth Science Research and Analysis budget , which is a joint product of the White House&#8217;s Office of Management and Budget and the NASA Administrator, Michael Griffin. Therefore, Griffin is right. Unfortunately, protecting the earth against climate change is not part of NASA&#8217;s mission anymore. But that&#8217;s because he changed the mission. NSA launches marketing blitz. National Security Agency Director Lt. Gen Keith Alexander has launched a marketing blitz. His goal: to get his employees on message. Last month, Alexander launched an &#8220;Internal Communications Campaign&#8221; to promote &#8220;buy-in&#8221; among his troops for plans to modernize NSA&#8217;s spy capabilities and to generate &#8220;positive&#8221; news stories , according to planning documents obtained by The Baltimore Sun. Among the measures of success are more media stories &#8220;that highlight NSA successes&#8221; and a &#8220;decrease in media leaks by current &#038; former employees.&#8221; The NSA joins other federal agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which &#8220;is spending millions of dollars on a publicity campaign that could be used to plug budget shortfalls hurricane forecasters are struggling with.&#8221; Former U.S. Commander In Iraq: War Is Lost Retired Army Lt.

In &#8220;his first interview since he retired last year,&#8221; Sanchez has said that the war in Iraq is lost, and the best outcome America can hope for is to &#8220; .&#8221; From his remarks after a recent speech in San Antonio I think if we do the right things politically and economically with the right Iraqi leadership we could still salvage at least a stalemate, if you will &#8212; not a stalemate but at least stave off defeat ,&#8221; Sanchez told the San Antonio Express-News. &#8220;It&#8217;s also kind of important for us to answer the question, &#8216;What is victory?&#8217;, and at this point I&#8217;m not sure America really knows what victory is &#8220;I am absolutely convinced that America has a crisis in leadership at this time and we&#8217;ve got to do whatever we can to help the next generation of leaders do better than we have done over the past five years,&#8221; Sanchez said, &#8220;better than what this cohort of political and military leaders have done.&#8221; Sanchez &#8220;is the highest-ranking former military leader yet to suggest the Bush administration has fallen short in Iraq.&#8221; In April, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) also said that at this stage, the war in Iraq &#8220; can only be won diplomatically, politically and economically I believe&#8230;that this war is lost , and this surge is not accomplishing anything, as is shown by the extreme violence in Iraq this week,&#8221; Reid told journalists. [&#8230;] &#8220;I know I was the odd guy out at the White House, but I told him at least what he needed to hear &#8230; I believe the war at this stage can only be won diplomatically, politically and economically At the time, the right wing viciously attacked Reid, calling him &#8220; &#8221; and charging that his comments were &#8220; very, very close to treason .&#8221; But since that time, , in addition to Sanchez, have spoken out against the war. Nevertheless, conservatives continue to pound the issue. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has threatened that if a vote of no-confidence on Alberto Gonzales is brought to the floor, he may bring an amendment on &#8220; whether the Iraq War is actually &#8216;lost&#8217; as Reid has suggested The silver lining of a perforated uterus. The Washington Post today highlights a rift in the anti-choice movement . Several groups believe the Supreme Court&#8217;s recent ruling upholding a ban on late-term abortions &#8220; was a disaster for their cause &#8221; because some late-term abortion procedures would still be legal. But James Dobson&#8217;s Focus on the Family supports the Court&#8217;s decision. Its reasoning: The old procedure [standard D&#038;E], which is still legal, involves using forceps to pull the baby apart in utero, which means there is greater legal liability and danger of internal bleeding from a perforated uterus . So we firmly believe there will be fewer later-term abortions as a result of this ruling.&#8221; In other words, Marty Lederman writes, the Court&#8217;s ruling &#8220;is especially desirable precisely the primary alternative method of late-term abortion endangers the health of women Time hires Dick Armey as new blogger. Former House Majority Leader (R-TX) will be a new contributor to Time magazine&#8217;s blog Swampland (to balance its cadre of liberals like ). In 2005, Armey participated on a panel listing the &#8220; Ten Most Harmful Government Programs. &#8221; Among the 10 were Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Endangered Species Act, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. : In 1995, Armey referred to openly gay Congressman Barney Frank (D-MA) as &#8220; .&#8221; &#8220;Armey maintains it was a slip of the tongue.&#8221; (HT: TP commenter McCain Declares Americans Will Support U.S. Troops In Iraq For 50 Years The White House announced this week that it &#8220;would like to see a lengthy U.S. troop presence in Iraq like the one in South Korea,&#8221; where U.S. troops have been stationed for 50 years. In the face of overwhelming evidence that Americans want U.S. troops out of Iraq, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has baselessly declared that Americans will support a long-term military presence &#8220;as long as the number of U.S. casualties can drop to almost nothing &#8220;The key to this issue is not American presence, but American casualties ,&#8221; he told a standing-room-only crowd of about 250 employees at Nationwide Insurance&#8217;s offices. &#8220;We have had troops in South Korea for 60 years and nobody minds,&#8221; McCain said. &#8220;If you stay a long, long time, but have the Iraqis doing the fighting, and your people are back in the bases and away from the firing line, I think Americans would be satisfied.&#8221; All the evidence suggests , that Americans want U.S. troops out of Iraq. Moreover, an ABC News poll this year found that 78 percent of Iraqis &#8220; oppose the presence of U.S. forces on their soil &#8220;; just one percent of Iraqis &#8220;want the US military presence to go on without end This means that, unlike Korea, there is little chance that the U.S. presence in Iraq will be casualty-free. Indeed, &#8220;the specter of a permanent military presence in Iraq is widely considered to be one of the most inflammatory incitements to Iraq&#8217;s ever-growing anti-American insurgency Of course, even if McCain admits that Americans don&#8217;t want to be in Iraq forever, it wouldn&#8217;t matter. He has previously proclaimed that he can ignore American public opinion because he knows &#8220; what&#8217;s best for the security of this nation. Insurgents claim to have killed missing U.S. troops. &#8220;An Iraqi insurgent group says it has killed two missing American soldiers who they said had been captured alive &#8230;The group Islamic State of Iraq posted the videotape on the Internet today showing what it said were the military ID cards and other personal items of the two U.S. soldiers believed to have been captured last month in Iraq.&#8221; CBS: Rep. Jefferson indicted. &#8220;Sources tell CBS News that Congressman William Jefferson (D-LA) has been indicted on more than a dozen counts involving public corruption Federal prosecutors are seeking an indictment today against Rep. William J. Jefferson (D-La.) in a longstanding FBI corruption probe centering on allegations that he took bribes to promote high-tech business ventures in Africa, sources familiar with the investigation said. Prosecutors are presenting the case to grand jurors in Alexandria today, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because no charges have yet been filed. If filed, the indictment would cap a long and tumultuous investigation that was stalled for months because of a legal battle over the constitutionality of an FBI raid on Jefferson&#8217;s office last May. The raid came after the FBI found $90,000 in the freezer of his Capitol Hill home. &#8220;A Justice Department official familiar with the case said the indictment outlining the evidence against Jefferson is more than an inch thick and charges the congressman with crimes that could keep him in prison for up to 200 years the 16 count indictment has been returned , and &#8220;the charges include racketeering, solicitation of bribes, honest services wire fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, violating the foreign corrupt practices act, and conspiracy.&#8221; Charges against child soldier held at Gitmo dropped. A legal battle with global implications was set to begin tomorrow with the Guantanamo Bay arraignment of Omar Ahmed Khadr, accused of killing a U.S. soldier with a grenade in 2002, when Khadr was 15 years old. &#8220;A range of legal experts describe as the first child fighter in decades to face war-crimes charges .&#8221; Now, the case has inexplicably A military judge has dismissed charges against Canadian detainee Omar Khadr, saying the matter is outside the jurisdiction of the military tribunal system. Khadr, a Canadian who was 15 when he was captured in Afghanistan&#8230;faced terrorism charges Monday under a reconfigured military tribunal system that critics say remains unconstitutional. A 15-year-old held at Guantanamo for nearly 5 years, and now a day before his arraignment, the U.S. says he&#8217;s actually &#8220;outside the jurisdiction&#8221; of the tribunal system. Rove hires new deputy. Karl Rove has hired a deputy, the new White House political director &#8220;He&#8217;s one of the political geniuses of our time,&#8221; Felts said of Rove. &#8220;It&#8217;s neat to see how his mind works.&#8221; [&#8230;] Felts didn&#8217;t have to move far in his new job: down a floor and across the hall to an office in the Executive Office Building, which is across the street from the White House. Before this appointment, he was Vice President Dick Cheney&#8217;s assistant for political affairs. He previously was associate director of the White House Office of Political Affairs. He also has worked for several other GOP politicians, including former Sen. Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina and former Vice President Dan Quayle. Calling Himself &#8216;The Whitest Man In America,&#8217; Fox&#8217;s Gibson Defends &#8216;Ooga Booga Fever&#8217; Last week, during a discussion of the &#8220;TB Man story,&#8221; Fox News anchor John Gibson declared that tuberculosis usually affects someone &#8220;from the third world&#8221; or who contracted &#8220; &#8221; in &#8220;some godforsaken hellhole.&#8221; Noting the criticism of his remarks from on the June 1 edition of his radio show. Calling himself &#8220;the whitest man in America, who is the black man&#8217;s best friend,&#8221; Gibson said his comments were not racist because he had just &#8220;invented&#8221; the term. &#8220;Now, I could have called it Machu Picchu fever or Latino jungle fever or something. I&#8217;ve gotten sick in those places too.&#8221; (Gibson noted, however, that he wouldn&#8217;t have called it &#8220;Potomac fever,&#8221; after Washington, DC.) Later, Gibson contradicted himself, claiming he learned the phrase from reading Joseph Wilson&#8217;s book, which references Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso. &#8220;So I, in making up ooga booga fever, I actually mispronounced the name of Burkina Faso. I should have said Ouagadougou fever.&#8221; CLICK HERE TO LISTEN This is not the first time John Gibson has spouted such casual racism on the air. On a recent edition of his radio show, he claimed that the U.S. invasion of Iraq had &#8220;unmasked&#8221; the Iraqis as &#8220; knuckle-dragging savages from the 10th century .&#8221; In 2006, he directed his viewers to &#8220; &#8221; because in &#8220;[t]wenty-five years&#8230;the majority of the population is Hispanic.&#8221; JOHN GIBSON: Now I am currently under assault on the internet. GIBSON: Again. It arises from a My Word I did yesterday about the TB man, Andrew Speaker. It has me completely mezmerized. TAPE OF GIBSON&#8217;S MY WORD: Now &#8220;My Word.&#8221; The TB Man story has me completely mesmerized. I&#8217;ve been doing this for a few years. It seems every time a story pops up about somebody who has suddenly contracted some strange or incurable disease, it&#8217;s somebody who is either from the third world, or was traveling through some godforsaken hellhole, and somehow managed to contract ooga booga fever. GIBSON: (laughter) Ooga booga fever seems to have set off a national panic. PRODUCER: Who had a problem with that? GIBSON: Well, the whitest man in America, who is the black man&#8217;s best friend, is now being alleged to be a racist for having invented something called ooga booga fever. ANNOUNCER: Gibson is a racist! GIBSON: Now, in the next sentence after that, I described how when I was in&#8230; TAPE OF GIBSON&#8217;S MY WORD: I got dengue fever in Mogadishu, Somalia, just for instance. GIBSON: I did, I got dengue fever. I didn&#8217;t even know what it was, but boy I found out. I was sick as a dog for days. And still going on the air and doing these reports for NBC, climbing out of that bed, where I was sweating off pounds, go up to the roof and sit there looking like a deadman, and do a report every hour, and never missed one. and I had that fever. TAPE OF GIBSON&#8217;S MY WORD: You tend not to get dengue fever in Los Angeles or Jersey City. GIBSON: And my point is, that, you know, the TB guy, his father in law works with TB, swears he didn&#8217;t bring it home. PRODUCER: On his shoes or something. GIBSON: Yeah, he had to have been, he&#8217;s a traveler or something, he had to have been going some place to pick up this particularly virulent form of tuberculosis. Now, I could have called it Machu Picchu fever or latino jungle fever or something. I&#8217;ve gotten sick in those places too. GIBSON: No, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have called it that. So, today, the left wing blogs erupted. Calling me a racist over the invented disease I called ooga booga fever. PRODUCER: Google it on Media Matters. GIBSON: Media Matters is going after me. ThinkProgress is going after me. Now, Media Matters assures me, the fact that Media Matters has taken me on , put my picture up there and quoted ooga booga fever as being racist. (laughter) It&#8217;s guaranteed that I&#8217;m going to be the Worst Person in the World, in somebody&#8217;s mind. PRODUCER: When somebody climbs out of the bathtub on Monday. GIBSON: Yeah, when the little boat is put away, and the bathtub&#8217;s drained, I&#8217;ll end up being the worst person. As a matter of fact, I just looked up, cause I knew that there was some place that I&#8217;d kinda got that word, and I had gotten out of, of all places, Joe Wilson&#8217;s book. And I remember him writing that he flew into the, that in order to get to Niger, you have to fly into the capital of the neighboring country, Burkina Faso, to the capital of Ouagadougou. And I said &#8220;Now that can not be true.&#8221; So I got out my little MapQuest, and sure enough, up pops the map, and right there next to Niger is the country of Burkina Faso and the capitol city of Og-ga Doo-gu. So I, in making up ooga booga fever, I actually mispronounced the name of Burkina Faso. I should have said Ouagadougou fever. PRODUCER: ThinkProgress: Ooga booga fever. This summarizes the entirety of Republican&#8217;s knowledge of science. PRODUCER: ThinkProgress: Hey, Julia Roberts used to be America&#8217;s Sweetheart, then Meg Ryan. Uncle John Gibson is America&#8217;s crazy uncle. We&#8217;ve all had him or got him. PRODUCER: ThinkProgress: Ooga booga fever. Geez, what&#8217;s next? Gibson in black face? GIBSON: I mean, these guys are going off the deep end. And I knew it. The second I said it, the crew in the studio laughed, four of whom are black. And I said, they laughed, you know, I&#8217;ve learned to sort of sense these things. I say something like that, I get a laugh, there&#8217;s gonna be somebody who&#8217;s offended. This is how they beat me over the head. That Media Matters, which as it turns out now, as some investigating has revealed, was invented by the Hillary Clinton campaign. They got together with David Brock and they just put this thing together, secretly. And he&#8217;s been funded secretly by the Clinton campaign. And it is an attack machine on anybody who doesn&#8217;t tow the liberal line, anybody who attacks Hillary, or, in their view, misrepresents what she says or thinks, or anybody who purports to explain any conservative idea. So they&#8217;re after me now over this ooga boog fever. Ooga booga, is, from Wikipedia here, this is a video game. &#8220;Ooga Booga is an online multiplayer game for the Sega Dreamcast&#8230;The storyline is that Ooga Booga is a volcano goddess that creates islands, and has leaders of tribes, &#8216;Kahunas&#8217;, battle for her favor.&#8221; You think, Rich, I should have reconsidered Ooga Booga fever? GIBSON: Yeah, I don&#8217;t either, actually. Ashley, was I being racist? ASHLEY: You might have a problem with The Night Before Christmas. There&#8217;s a character in it, claymation, named Oogie Boogie man. I figure if you&#8217;re anything, it&#8217;s racist against claymation. GIBSON: Well that&#8217;s probably true. GIBSON: There&#8217;s another racist. Even saying the words &#8216;ooga booga,&#8217; must be a white man and must be a racist. We&#8217;re discovering all kinds of ooga booga references. Turns out the poet laurete of ahh, is this an American? Fredrick Sidel? He wrote a book of poetry called ooga booga. How many liberal websites am I now being trashed on Angry Rich? ANGRY RICH: You&#8217;re on two of the biggest ones right now, front page. GIBSON: We&#8217;re pretty sure that come Monday, I&#8217;ll be ahh &#8212; You think I&#8217;ll make Worse, Worser or Worst? ANGRY RICH: You&#8217;ll probably be the&#8230;well, for more than one reason, you&#8217;ll be the worst. GIBSON: Oh, are you keeping something from me? ANGRY RICH: Remember that bit we did earlier? ANGRY RICH: We sang a song about&#8230; GIBSON: Oh, it&#8217;s all a blur. Price of photo-op with Bush keeps dropping. &#8220;Gas prices may be up, but there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s apparently a little cheaper these days: A photo with President Bush. Bush headlined a fundraiser for the New Jersey state GOP, where donors could pay $5,000 to pose for a photo with the Commander in Chief. Expensive photo op, right? Well, that&#8217;s actually cheaper that what donors paid just a year ago for a grip and grin with Bush. Last summer, GOP officials around the country charged at least $10,000 a pop for presidential photo op, a bargain compared to the $25,000-a-flash Bush commanded during some Republican National Committee fund-raisers back in 2000 and 2004.&#8221; Food prices have increased 3.7 percent in the past year. They are on track to rise &#8220; by as much as 7 percent by year&#8217;s end . &#8230; The current increase is more than double the 1.8 percent jump seen the year before, according to the consumer price index. Meanwhile, gas prices rose 2.9 percent. Only the cost of health care rose more, and then just slightly.&#8221; Conservatives Who Called For Gonzales&#8217; Resignation Silent On No-Confidence Vote If the Senate moves ahead with a no-confidence vote on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales next week as planned, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has already made clear he will &#8220;tie up the Senate floor with all kinds of procedural mischief and introduce any number of amendments.&#8221; McConnell has also cracked the whip and brought his caucus into line. Roll Call reports today that none of the six conservative senators who have called for Gonzales to resign have said they will vote for the measure Six GOP Senators have gone on the record essentially demanding Gonzales&#8217; resignation, and one of them &#8212; Sen. Tom Coburn (Okla.) &#8212; he&#8217;ll vote against the nonbinding no-confidence resolution. The five others &#8212; Sens. John Sununu (N.H.), Chuck Hagel (Neb.), Gordon Smith (Ore.), John McCain (Ariz.) and Norm Coleman (Minn.) &#8212; were unwilling to tip their hands about how they will vote, despite repeated attempts to contact them last week. All five undeclared senators have offered for Gonzales in the past, garnering press attention and bolstering their image: Sen. John Sununu (R-NH): &#8220;The president should fire the attorney general and replace him as soon as possible with someone who can provide strong, aggressive leadership Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE): &#8220;The American people deserve an Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer of our country, whose honesty and capability are beyond question. Attorney General Gonzales can no longer meet this standard. He has failed this country. He has lost the moral authority to lead. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ): &#8220;I think that out of loyalty to the president that that [resignation] would probably be the best thing that he could do Sen. Gordon Smith (R-OR)- &#8220; For the Justice Department to be effective before the U.S. Senate, it would be helpful. Sen. Norm Coleman (R-MN): &#8220; I don&#8217;t believe that Gonzales has the type of leadership that the department needs. Now, forced to choose accountability over party loyalty, these senators have gone silent. Sacrificing Doan to save Gonzales. Robert Novak reports that the White House is so preoccupied with saving Attorney General Alberto Gonzales that no one in the White House is helping GSA administrator Lurita &#8220;cookies on the table&#8221; Doan : &#8220;The White House has done no more to help Doan than it did for Bloch. One congressional Republican asked a senior White House aide why. The response, he said, amounted to this: This is a very tough time for us when we are preoccupied trying to save Alberto Gonzales , and Doan will just have to save herself.&#8221; ThinkFast: June 4, 2007 &#8220;The protests in Europe started even before President Bush&#8217;s scheduled departure Monday morning for an eight-day visit to six countries, including the G-8 summit in Germany . Over the weekend, demonstrators in Germany were out protesting many issues, but Bush and Iraq are near the top of their list &#8220;House Oversight and Government Reform Committee staffers appear close to an agreement that would limit the number of e-mails the panel will demand from the Republican National Committee as part of an investigation of political presentations given to federal agencies War critics in Congress &#8220;plan a summer of repeated Iraq-related votes &#8221; designed to force Bush supporters &#8220;to abandon the White House before the fall.&#8221; The votes will be linked to expanded local campaigns to pressure members in their own states. &#8220;Our job is to go into the congressional districts of members and create a political environment that is toxic ,&#8221; said Tom Matzzie of Americans Against Escalation in Iraq. legal battle with global implications begins tomorrow with the Guantanamo Bay arraignment of Omar Ahmed Khadr, accused of killing a U.S. soldier with a grenade in 2002, when he was 15 years old. &#8220;A range of legal experts describe as the first child fighter in decades to face war-crimes charges unprecedented openness regarding Congress&#8217; pork barrel practices , House Democrats are moving in the opposite direction as they draw up spending bills for the upcoming budget year.&#8221; Democrats are sidestepping their own rules and adding earmarks when it is &#8220; too late for critics to effectively challenge them More than four years into the Iraq war, the Defense Department &#8220;has formed a task force comprised of military and federal law enforcement agencies&#8221; to &#8220; investigate contract fraud and public corruption related to Iraq reconstruction.&#8221; The Senate architects of a &#8220;delicate immigration compromise are increasingly convinced that they will hold together this week pass an overhaul of the nation&#8217;s immigration laws , with momentum building behind one unifying theme: Today&#8217;s immigration system is too broken to go unaddressed.&#8221; Due to the growing climate crisis, &#8220;has seen its primary subject turn into a hot-button issue,&#8221; and &#8220;has decided not to tread gingerly,&#8221; covering climate change and related science. &#8220;If The Weather Channel isn&#8217;t talking about climate change and global warming, &#8221; a network executive said. And finally: Last week at a conference, a colleague of actor Ben Affleck asked former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay if he&#8217;d sign a copy of &#8216; No Retreat, No Surrender &#8216; for the Hollywood actor.&#8221; Even though Affleck is outspoken on liberal issues, DeLay admitted that he is a big fan of Affleck&#8217;s 1995 film &#8220; .&#8221; DeLay&#8217;s inscription to Affleck: &#8220;Ben and Jen &#8212; Loved you in Mallrats, this book is kind of like that . Keep the Faith &#8212; Tom DeLay.&#8221; Highlights from tonight&#8217;s presidential debate First internal assessment of escalation negative. &#8220;Three months after the start of the Baghdad security plan that has added thousands of American and Iraqi troops to the capital, they control fewer than one-third of the city&#8217;s neighborhoods, far short of the initial goal for the operation , according to some commanders and an internal military assessment.&#8221; June 3, 2007 11:57 pm | June 3, 2007 11:57 pm Ed Gillespie may replace Dan Bartlett. Former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie &#8220;has emerged as a potential replacement to Dan Bartlett as counselor to President Bush. &#8230; After taking the reins of the national party in 2003, Gillespie was part of the Bush-Cheney inner circle in the 2004 campaign. He also served a key role for the White House in shepherding Supreme Court justices Samuel Alito and John Roberts through the Senate confirmation process after Bush&#8217;s reelection.&#8221; June 3, 2007 10:35 pm | June 3, 2007 10:35 pm Officials discuss &#8216;detailed&#8217; plans for permanent bases. &#8220;For the first time, the Bush administration is beginning publicly to discuss basing American troops in Iraq for years, even decades to come, a subject so fraught with political landmines that officials are tiptoeing around the inevitable questions about what the United States&#8217; long-term mission would be there.&#8221; Administration officials and top military leaders declined to talk on the record about their long-term plans in Iraq. But when speaking on a not-for-attribution basis, they describe a fairly detailed concept. It calls for maintaining three or four major bases in the country , all well outside of the crowded urban areas where casualties have soared. They would include the base at Al Asad in Anbar Province, Balad Air Base about 50 miles north of Baghdad, and Tallil Air Base in the south. Never mind, as Bill Scher , that the Iraq spending bill that President Bush just signed includes the SEC. 3301. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this or any other Act shall be obligated or expended by the United States Government for a purpose as follows: (1) To establish any military installation or base for the purpose of providing for the permanent stationing of United States Armed Forces in Iraq. (2) To exercise United States control over any oil resource of Iraq. June 3, 2007 6:28 pm | June 3, 2007 6:28 pm Number of U.S. troops killed during &#8220; three deadly days in Iraq . &#8230; The deaths raised to at least 3,493 members of the U.S. military who have died since the war started in March 2003, according to an Associated Press count.&#8221; June 3, 2007 5:49 pm | June 3, 2007 5:49 pm Murtha Says He Has &#8216;Lost A Lot Of Confidence&#8217; In Military Leaders, Including Petraeus On ABC&#8217;s This Week today, host George Stephanopoulos asked Rep. John Murtha (D-PA) about whether Congress would &#8220;move again to get a timetable for withdrawal in September if the benchmarks aren&#8217;t met, even if General Petraeus&#8230;comes to Congress in September and says he needs more time.&#8221; &#8220;He has an awful lot of credibility,&#8221; he added. Murtha quickly disputed Stephanopoulos&#8217;s premise. &#8220;George, let me tell you, I&#8217;ve lost a lot of confidence in many of the military leaders. Because they say what the White house wants them to say,&#8221; said Murtha. Asked if he included Petraeus in his lack of confidence, Murtha added, &#8220;I&#8217;m waiting to see what he has to say. But I am absolutely convinced there has been this overly optimistic picture of what&#8217;s going on in Iraq, while the figures show the opposite.&#8221; Watch it: Unfortunately, Murtha is right. Petraeus, and other military officers, have a history of supporting the administration line, despite the facts on the ground. In April, while Congress was preparing to vote on its Iraq timeline legislation, the administration brought Petraeus back to the United States from Iraq for a rare visit, which Murtha slammed as &#8220; purely a political move .&#8221; Petraeus has allowed himself to be used as a &#8220; the White House&#8217;s war czar nominee . He has also that al Qaeda, not sectarian civil war, is the greatest threat in Iraq &#8212; an assessment that STEPHANOPOULOS: So you&#8217;re convinced that Congress is going to move again to get a timetable for withdrawal in September if the benchmarks aren&#8217;t met, even if General Petraeus, as we&#8217;ve been hearing, comes to the Congress in September and says he needs more time. He has an awful lot of credibility. MURTHA: George, let me tell you, I&#8217;ve lost a lot of confidence in many of the military leaders. Because they say what the White House wants them to say. STEPHANOPOULOS: Including General Petraeus? MURTHA: Well, I&#8217;m waiting to see what he has to say. But I am absolutely convinced there has been this overly optimistic picture of what&#8217;s going on in Iraq, while the figures show the opposite. For instance, how can you say things are going well when casualties in the last two months are at the highest level in any two month-period during the war? How can you say when none of the economic things have gotten better? How can you say when they haven&#8217;t done the political things they need to do and they keep putting it off? How can you say when their parliament is in recess during a period when our people are dying and in harm&#8217;s way? How can you say you&#8217;re making progress? The Iraqis have to take this on themselves. We&#8217;re caught in a civil war, and our troops are being killed in this civil war. June 3, 2007 11:37 am Talabani Says Iraqi Troops Will Be Ready &#8216;Next Year,&#8217; After Making Same Promise Two Years Ago Since 2005, President Bush has argued that the U.S. strategy in Iraq is: &#8220; As the Iraqis stand up, we will stand down .&#8221; This morning on ABC&#8217;s This Week, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani promised that Iraqi troops will be able to defend their country by the &#8220;end of the next year.&#8221; Watch it: points out, Talabani&#8217;s timeline is unlikely. On April 11, 2005, Talabani also promised that Iraqi forces would be able to defend their country &#8220; The newly elected president of Iraq said Sunday he expects that U.S. troops will be gone from his country within two years. Jalal Talabani told CNN two years should be enough time for Iraqi forces to rebuild and secure control of the country as well as take over the job currently being performed by some 140,000 U.S. troops. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki also promised in Nov. 2006 that his &#8220;country&#8217;s forces would be able to assume security command by June 2007 &#8212; which could allow the United States to start withdrawing its troops.&#8221; The United States should not remain mired in Iraq until all Iraqi security forces are trained. Military leaders originally &#8220; planned to train 325,000 Iraqi security forces .&#8221; But this effort has been hampered by militia members infiltrating the forces and &#8220;using their power to carry out sectarian attacks.&#8221; The Washington Post&#8217;s David Ignatius recently reported that nevertheless, the White House&#8217;s post-surge strategy will likely &#8220; focus on training and advising Iraqi troops rather than the broader goal of achieving a political reconciliation in Iraq.&#8221; TALABANI: I agree to put constructive pressure on Iraqi government, but I think we must be realistic. Unless we will be able to prepare our forces, armed forces, including army and police forces, to replace coalition forces, something as unpractical and&#8230; STEPHANOPOULOS: But how long is that going to take? The training&#8217;s been going on for so long. TALABANI: Well, you know, to building an army after the collapse of the regime is not so easy. STEPHANOPOULOS: When will the Iraqi army be ready to defend Iraq? TALABANI: I think in the end of the next year. STEPHANOPOULOS: End of 2008. STEPHANOPOULOS: So U.S. forces will have to stay at high levels at least until then. TALABANI: I cannot say. I&#8217;m not the president of the United States to decide how American forces &#8212; when they must leave. But I think, as you asked of me, the end of 2000 sic, we will be able to have an army. June 3, 2007 10:39 am Attacks on U.S. troops grow in lethality. &#8220;The intensity of combat and the greater lethality of attacks on U.S. troops is underscored by the lower ratio of wounded to killed for May, which fell to about 4.8 to 1 &#8212; compared with an average of 8 to 1 in the Iraq conflict, according Pentagon data. &#8216;The closer you get to a stand-up fight, the closer you&#8217;re going to get to that 3-to-1 ratio&#8217; that typified 2oth-century U.S. warfare, said John Pike, director of Globalsecurity.org, a defense information Web site.&#8221; June 3, 2007 10:38 am | June 3, 2007 10:38 am Rice notes Rumsfeld&#8217;s efforts to &#8220;sideline&#8221; her. An interesting excerpt from a Newsweek with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, discussing that Vice President Cheney is working to undermine her efforts: RICE: I want to say something about the vice president. You know, if he doesn&#8217;t agree, the vice president talks about it, just as if [Defense Secretary] Bob Gates doesn&#8217;t agree, or I don&#8217;t agree, we sit down and talk about it. And then if necessary we talk about it with the president and he decides &#8230; The vice president has never been somebody who tries to do that on the sidelines, behind the scenes. He really doesn&#8217;t. Q: Not even when Don Rumsfeld was around? RICE: [Laughs] You asked about when I have been secretary of State.

On Monday, the company announced a decrease of $100 in the price tag of new Blu-ray high-definition movie-disc player it is shipping this week. The company held that the BDP-S300 will now be available for $499, instead of the previously announced price of $599. The louring in the price is due to the falling production costs and a boost in demand. The new price tag is almost half the price of the first Blu ray Disc player- BDP-S1, which was launched by Sony on December 4, 2006, and had an exorbitant price of $1000. Although, Sony has shaved the price for its latest Blu-ray Disc player, it still faces a tough completion from its rival Toshiba, which sells their high-definition DVD players for less than $300. Ever since the two giant companies introduced their respective technologies, they have been in cut throat competition with one another. The war between the biggies seems unending as both the formats introduced by them are incompatible. While Sonyâs Blu-ray Disc player has a gigantic memory capacity that makes it extortionately pricey, on the other hand, Toshibaâs HD DVD is an exceptionally well designed extension of accessible technology that is more dewy-eyed and cheaper to introduce. The HD DVD, which provides sharp, wide-screen images, aim at replacing the standard DVD players and the Electronics Association estimate that by the end of 2007, about 1 million players will be sold. However, neither of the two formats has got much acceptance by the customers, who hold that the High-def DVDs come with a high price tag and if one of the formats bites the dust, then consumers may be burdened with worthless equipment. Analyst Gerry Kaufhold at In-Stat/MDR, a technology industry research firm, holds that HD DVD will do great business for four or five years, but by 2009, consumers will jump on the Blu-ray Disc bandwagon. Blu-ray Disc, a high-density optical disc format for the storage of digital media, first wriggled their way to the market shelves when Philips announced their first Blu-ray Disc players in January 2006. Since the time it was introduced, till now, Blu-ray and HD DVD have been at daggers drawn at each other. Hollywood studios are split on the issue, but Blu-ray has the strongest support, with Columbia Pictures, MGM, Disney, Lionsgate and 20th century Fox supporting Blu-ray. Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks, Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema support both the formats. Weinstein Company is the only studio which supports HD DVD.

The FBI filed a criminal complaint Friday against a Chicago man for allegedly uploading four episodes of the hit series "24" to LiveDigital.com, a video hosting site, before their primetime broadcast. If convicted on a felony count, Jorge Romero, 24, could face up to three years in prison. The action represents a renewed aggressiveness to crack down on Internet bootleggers, particularly in the television industry, which has not been as vocal about anti-piracy activities as the music and movie businesses. Romero is not suspected of stealing the "24" episodes from Fox; that individual is still at large, and neither Fox nor federal investigators has given up on trying to find the culprit. 20th Century Fox, which produces "24," issued a statement supporting the FBI investigation. "We are grateful to the FBI and U.S. Attorney's offices in Los Angeles for aggressively pursuing this matter, and we hope it will serve as a powerful warning that uploading copyrighted TV shows and movies to the Internet can be a crime with significant penalties and will be prosecuted as such." "The FBI makes this a different ball game," said Jay Cooper, an attorney at Greenberg Traurig who specializes in intellectual property issues. "The public doesn't seem to get that it's wrong, and maybe a message like this has to get out there so people realize there are criminal penalties." The episodes in question were the first four episodes of the sixth season of "24," which aired over two consecutive days on Fox beginning January 14. To give the season an additional marketing push, Fox also made the four episodes available via early DVD release on January 16. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

As the MESSENGER spacecraft approaches the brightly illuminated Venus on June 5, 2007, it will begin a carefully planned sequence of science observations designed to practice activities planned seven months later at the first flyby of Mercury.

The complementary viewing geometries and instrument sets of the two spacecraft permit unprecedented two-platform observations of Venus' atmosphere, clouds, and interplanetary environment. Closely coordinated observations of atmospheric dynamics, cloud structure, and atmospheric chemistry are planned. Two-point measurements of the penetration of the interplanetary magnetic field into the Venus ionosphere, plasma boundaries, and tail will be made. Credit: Sean Solomon, The Carnegie Institution of Washington MESSENGER Flyby of Venus a Dress Rehearsal for Mercury posted: 04 June 2007 The upcoming flyby of a NASA spacecraft over Venus could provide new insights about the cloud-shrouded planet and will serve as a dress rehearsal for its rendezvous with its main target, Mercury, next year. On June 5, MESSENGER will fly over Venus in a maneuver designed to use the pull of the planet's gravity to slow it down enough that it can slip into the orbit of . During the flyby, MESSENGER will decelerate from 22.7 to 17.3 miles per second (36.5 to 27.8 km/s). "This change in MESSENGER's velocity is the largest of the mission," said MESSENGER mission systems engineer Eric Finnegan, of the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) at John Hopkins University. the Venus on the planet's dayside at more than 30,000 miles per hour (48,000 km/h), pass over the boundary separating day from night, and pass within 200 miles of the planet's surface while on its night side. The upcoming flyby will be MESSENGER's second pass by Venus. During the first flyby, in October 2006, no scientific observations were made because the planet was at superior conjunction, placing it on the opposite side of the sun from Earth. The closest approach on that flyby was about 1,800 miles (3,000 km) of the planet's surface. "Because of superior conjunction, because we knew we were going into radio blackout, and we knew we had the second flyby coming up in June, we elected not to turn on any of the instruments at the time of that flyby," said the mission's principal investigator, Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The second Venus flyby will mark the first time MESSENGER's full suite of scientific instruments is turned on simultaneously, allowing scientists to test and calibrate them before turning them onto their main planetary objective next January. "The approach geometry is sufficiently similar to that of Mercury, allowing the seven instrument-package to be turned on and operating collectively in scientific observing mode, just as they will be for Mercury," Finnegan said. MESSENGER is expected to collect more than 6 gigabytes of data about the Venus system and take more than 600 images during the 73- hour-flyby. The information will provide new observations about Venus's atmosphere, cloud structure, space environment, and perhaps even its surface. During its brief sojourn, MESSENGER will join a European spacecraft, Venus Express, that is currently in orbit around Venus. The will work together to investigate how particles from the Sun's solar wind affects and controls the upper layers of Venus's atmosphere. "By coordinating and comparing these observations, we will be able to maximize the science from both missions and potentially learn things that would not be revealed by one set of observations alone," said study team member Ralph McNutt, also of APL. Launched in August 2004, the MEcury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission is the first to visit our solar system's innermost planet in more than 30 years, ever since NASA's Mariner 10 mapped about 45 percent of its surface.

Pachter believes Take-Two may push Rockstar's sequel back a few weeks for both financial reasons and to get further away from the likely massive release of Microsoft's shooter. At the moment Halo 3 is pencilled in for release on September 26 and GTA IV on October 19. "We believe that it is possible that the company will choose to 'throw in the towel' on FY:07 by shifting the release date for Grand Theft Auto IV by a few weeks, increasing the losses incurred this year and improving the company's prospects for FY:08," Pachter explains. "We believe that a two-week delay would provide a reasonable gap between the launch of Halo 3 and the launch of GTA IV, and would actually help sales of both games. In addition, a delay of the 'normal' SKU for GTA IV by two or three weeks could allow Take-Two to maximize revenues from the $89.99 Collector's Edition of the game by shipping that SKU on October 17, and to increase overall profitability."

"The public doesn't seem to get that it's wrong, and maybe a message like this has to get out there so people realize there are criminal penalties." The episodes in question were the first four episodes of the sixth season of "24," which aired over two consecutive days on Fox beginning Jan. 14. To give the season an additional marketing push, Fox also made the four episodes available via early DVD release on Jan. 16. Sources indicate Fox execs were hoping that by finding the offender they could ultimately determine the source of the leak, which they suspected occurred somewhere along the distribution chain for the DVD release. Though the discs went to market only after the episodes aired in primetime, they had been shipped to retailers weeks before that airdate, which made them susceptible to bootleggers. While the Internet is awash in pirated video content, it is rare for programs to find their way online before airdate. But eight days before the "24" TV premiere, Romero found the original file on a file-sharing service through Mininova.org, a bit torrent tracking site, according to the FBI affidavit. Romero allegedly downloaded them from an illegal file-sharing service and subsequently uploaded them to LiveDigital, and also posted Web links to the pirated episodes on Digg.com. Shortly after the episodes appeared on LiveDigital, Fox execs noticed the leak and moved to trace its origin. Both LiveDigital and YouTube were served subpoenas under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act demanding they disclose the identities of the users who uploaded the episodes, as well as past episodes of another Fox property, "The Simpsons." Both LiveDigital and YouTube complied with the subpoenas (HR, 1/25). But as Fox pursued a civil action, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles reached out to the studio in March and asked for its cooperation in building a criminal case. In April, FBI agents obtained a search warrant and arrived at Romero's home, where they seized his computer. During an interview conducted on the premises, Romero admitted to agents that he had uploaded the episodes to LiveDigital. In addition to information from LiveDigital and YouTube, the FBI was able to track down Romero with cooperation from Digg.com, where Romero posted links to the offending material, as well as Comcast Corp. and AT&T, the Internet service providers Romero used to access the Internet. A second search is still under way to find a second offender who uploaded the same episodes to YouTube, said sources, and who is identified in the affidavit by the name "ecototal." Though parent company Google complied with a subpoena to disclose the identity of that user, it has not led to an arrest. Had the FBI not intervened, sources said Fox likely would have brought a civil action against Romero, and still has legal grounds to do so. Piracy has always been an utmost cause of concern to parent company News Corp. In 2004, Fox broke up a movie piracy ring that emanated from its own studio. Romero is expected to surrender at the U.S. District Courthouse in Chicago on Tuesday, when arrangements will be made for his travel to Los Angeles, according to Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the Department of Justice.

Nintendo sold 251,794 of its newest game machines in May, outselling Sony&#39;s PlayStation 3 consoles five to one, Tokyo- based research firm Enterbrain Inc. said today in a faxed statement. The PS3 trailed the Wii by four to one in April. The PS3, equipped with the industry&#39;s most powerful gaming chip, is falling further behind the cheaper Wii, undermining Sony&#39;s ability to recoup investments into the machine. Kyoto, Japan-based Nintendo has forecast sales of the new consoles, where gamers swing motion-sensor controllers to play games such as bowling and tennis, will triple this fiscal year. Microsoft Corp.&#39;s game-player sales trailed Sony&#39;s in Japan last month, with the U.S. company selling 11,082 of its Xbox 360 machines, the Enterbrain report said. Nintendo&#39;s handheld DS player outsold Sony&#39;s PlayStation Portable five to one in May, Enterbrain said. The company sold 620,670 of the touch-screen players, compared with 123,673 PSPs.
