Though military sources had not yet provided details, the family of Army 1st Lt. Keith Heidtman said they were told he died Monday when his helicopter went down in the volatile Diyala province northeast of Baghdad. As Heidtman's family learned of the 24-year-old's death, news was emerging from Iraq about the incident. The U.S. military on Tuesday announced the loss of a Kiowa helicopter - a small, highly maneuverable scouting and attack aircraft with two aboard. As a ground rescue team raced toward the scene, its vehicles were hit by roadside bombs, killing six more soldiers. Two other soldiers were killed Monday by a roadside bomb in south Baghdad, the military reported. The 116 deaths reported by i-casualities.org, a website that compiles statistics about the war in Iraq, makes this month among the worst of the war. The site also gives the latest total count of U.S. fatalities at 3,468. Heidtman's family and friends struggled Tuesday with the news that they had lost a son, brother, baseball player and college graduate. The family issued a statement, saying they were devastated by the loss but "proud of his service to his country." "We support what he wanted to do," said his stepfather, Arthur Robidoux. They also wanted to say they were glad for the support already pouring in. Their day was hectic, Robidoux said - "mentally and physically trying." Keith Heidtman, the son of Kerry Heidtman and Maureen Robidoux, graduated six years ago from the Norwich Free Academy. Hugh "Duke" Campbell, a principal there, was his assistant baseball coach. "It's tragic news for all of us," Campbell said. Campbell knew Heidtman since he was a boy coming to baseball camps and remembers him as the hard-working first baseman and outfielder who hit .371 one year. On Tuesday, he sat looking at a letter of recommendation he had written for the pending grad in 2000, when Heidtman was applying to the University of Connecticut. It opened: "Keith Heidtman represents everything that is right about young people today. He brings the whole package to the table every day." Heidtman graduated two years ago from UConn with honors. His education also included ROTC - the four-year training program to become a military officer. "He showed up in my office one day," said Maj. Glenn Colby, enrollment officer there. "He wanted to serve his country," Colby said. "You couldn't ask for a better kid." Last year, Heidtman had another graduation - from an Army aviation school in Alabama. And then, six months ago, he was in Iraq. As Memorial Day approached, Task Force Lightning was working northeast of Baghdad in one of Iraq's more unsettled regions. The commander of U.S. forces there, Maj. Gen. Benjamin Mixon, said earlier this month that Diyala province's government is nonfunctional and that he would need additional forces in Diyala "to get that situation to a more acceptable level." Seventeen days later, on Monday, eight of his soldiers were killed in this single incident. A spokesman with the Connecticut National Guard, which is usually assigned to assist Connecticut families like Heidtman's in the casualty process, said his office isn't allowed to talk about such casualties in the first 24 hours after the family is notified. But as she has so many times, Gov. M. Jodi Rell on Tuesday ordered that the state's flags fly at half-staff until the burial. From the Multi-National Force Iraq, a brief notice: "Two Task Force Lightning soldiers were killed when a helicopter went down in Diyala province May 28. The incident is under investigation." Heidtman isn't the first former student of Norwich Free Academy killed in Iraq. That was Spec. Jacob D. Martir, shot in Sadr City in 2004. Nor was he the first ROTC graduate from UConn to fall. Capt. Jason Hamill was killed in Iraq just a few weeks before Heidtman got there. Contact Jesse Hamilton at jhamilton@courant.com. Interact with The Courant: Reader Rep.

Lewis "Scooter" Libby. Libby, who was convicted in March of perjury and obstruction in the CIA leak case, had asked that the letters not be released. Attorneys for several news organizations argued that the law required the letters be made public. U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton agreed, citing a need for transparency. "The court has received more than 150 sentencing letters in this case, some urging leniency for the defendant and some expressing opprobrium at the defendant's actions and calling for the imposition of a substantial prison sentence," Walton wrote. The letters will be released after Libby is sentenced June 5, Walton said. Addresses and other personal information will not be released. Libby was convicted of lying about his conversations with reporters about former CIA officer Valerie Plame, whose secret position was revealed in a 2003 newspaper column. Libby was not the source for that story but a jury found that he made several false statements to leak investigators and obstructed the investigation. Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has asked that Libby receive up to three years in prison. Libby is expected to ask for no jail time. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Zoellick "is deeply devoted to the mission of the World Bank," Bush said in a brief announcement Wednesday. "He wants to help struggling nations defeat poverty, to grow their economies and offer their people the hope of a better life." If approved by the World Bank board as expected, Zoellick would take over a mammoth institution grappling to redefine itself in the wake of the ethics scandal that led to Wolfowitz's resignation after a bitter battle that lasted months. The board said in a statement late Tuesday that it would accept nominations from any board member, not just the United States, and hoped to make a final decision by June 30, when Wolfowitz officially steps down. The United States controls about 16% of the board's voting power. By tradition, the U.S. president names the president of the bank, while the Europeans have controlled the leadership of its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund. However, the appointment in 2005 of Wolfowitz, one of the architects of the U.S. war in Iraq, led many in the developing world and in Europe to question whether the tradition ought to be abandoned. "We need to put yesterday's discord behind us and to focus on the future together," Zoellick said in his remarks at the White House. Zoellick promised to listen carefully to the bank's staff, donors and borrowers. By all accounts, Zoellick, 53, is well regarded in the tight world of global finance, winning the backing of key European finance ministers. He served as U.S. trade representative in Bush's first term, helping to launch the World Trade Organization's latest round of trade talks. He then moved to the State Department, serving as Condoleezza Rice's top deputy. He's been a managing director at Goldman Sachs for the past year. Praise for Zoellick flowed in from official Washington. "Bob has the skills and the integrity to put the bank back on the right path," said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. "The institution's membership should expect a leader dedicated to reducing poverty and intolerant of corruption and kleptocracy," said Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., the minority whip in the House. "The president should have been selected on merit, not nationality," said Elizabeth Stuart, a senior policy adviser for Oxfam International, in a statement. However, Zoellick could prove himself the right person for the job if he turns the bank's priorities upside down to focus on helping the poor, rather than on pleasing donors or bureaucrats. "We are disappointed," said Sameer Dossani, director of the 50 Years is Enough Network. "He's another white, male, neoconservative." Dossani said Zoellick had carried the water for U.S. corporations, especially the pharmaceutical industry, in trade negotiations. "He doesn't have any development experience, and he doesn't have the respect of many people." Rex Nutting is Washington bureau chief of MarketWatch.

The former U.S. trade representative will take over a 61- year-old agency that has expanded its mandate beyond building roads and clinics to include goals such as promoting ecological tourism and funding theater groups. Zoellick is more likely to concentrate on objectives that bring tangible results. ``The bank has to focus its mission on poverty reduction,&#39;&#39; said John Taylor, undersecretary of Treasury for international affairs from 2001 to 2005 and now a professor of economics at Stanford University in Stanford, California. ``Bob&#39;s management experience will enable him to implement those measurable-results reforms very well.&#39;&#39; Zoellick, 53, who negotiated seven international trade agreements in President George W. Bush&#39;s first term, is also apt to emphasize the economic benefits of giving developing countries unfettered access to overseas markets. ``He deeply believes in free trade,&#39;&#39; said Kenneth Rogoff, a professor at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. Before he can alter the bank&#39;s mission, Zoellick will have to win the trust of 13,000 staffers demoralized by two years of conflicts with departing President Paul Wolfowitz, who resigned this month over his role in giving his companion a pay increase. Bank employees said the controversy had damaged the credibility of an institution that preaches good government. Managers and board members clashed with the former U.S. deputy defense secretary over his appointments of recruits from the Bush administration, the bank&#39;s role in Iraq and his anti- corruption agenda. ``Having to clean up the Wolfowitz mess is going to detract from any effort at reform for at least a year or two,&#39;&#39; said Desmond Lachman, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a former official at the International Monetary Fund. Zoellick, nominated by Bush yesterday, told reporters in Washington he will consult member countries about ``the role of the bank.&#39;&#39; He said he had spoken to former presidents James Wolfensohn and Robert McNamara. ``One of the biggest challenges, if not the biggest challenge, will be the leadership and management issues that the bank faces today,&#39;&#39; he said. ``This institution has been through a traumatic period.&#39;&#39; Wolfowitz yesterday told Charlie Rose that he acted in good faith in dealing with his companion. ``I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a bad manager,&#39;&#39; Wolfowitz said, adding that because of the controversy, ``we&#39;d gotten to the point where it was not possible to be effective.&#39;&#39; Zoellick&#39;s nomination is subject to approval by the bank&#39;s board, which has said it would make a decision by June 30, when Wolfowitz leaves. The U.S. nominee has always won approval under an arrangement that reserves leadership of the IMF for a European. Zoellick became deputy secretary of state at the start of Bush&#39;s second term and left government in June of last year to become a vice chairman at New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc. He&#39;s on a long list of Goldman executives to join or rejoin the top ranks of government. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is a former Goldman chairman, and his former co-CEO Jon Corzine was elected senator from New Jersey and then governor. Joshua Bolton, Bush&#39;s chief of staff, was an executive director at Goldman in the 1990s. As trade representative in Bush&#39;s first term, Zoellick managed commercial relations with China and started the so- called Doha round of global talks. At the State Department, he traveled to Sudan to broker a peace agreement between the government and a rebel group. ``Zoellick is as good as it gets based on his record of promoting trade and combining policy vision with actual implementation of policies,&#39;&#39; said Ian Vasquez, director of the Project on Global Economic Liberty at the Washington-based Cato Institute. His diplomatic experience may help him continue Wolfowitz&#39;s fight against corruption. Wolfowitz ruffled feathers at the bank by suspending aid to countries including Kenya and Bangladesh without the board&#39;s approval. ``What Wolfowitz did was rub people&#39;s noses in it,&#39;&#39; said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ``He kind of marched up that mountain and now Zoellick has an easier task of keeping it going.&#39;&#39; Zoellick will also face criticism that the bank shouldn&#39;t lend to middle-income nations such as India and China, which can raise money in capital markets. Lending to such countries accounted for more than half of the $23 billion in World Bank aid last year. Zoellick yesterday ticked off a range of ills afflicting poor nations, including discrimination against women, corruption and environmental degradation. He didn&#39;t specify which ones the bank should tackle. ``Zoellick&#39;s really got a huge challenge ahead of him,&#39;&#39; said William Easterly, a former World Bank economist and a co- director of New York University&#39;s Development Research Institute. ``What the bank needs to do is find a few things it&#39;s good at doing and specialize in them.&#39;&#39; To contact the reporters on this story: William McQuillen in Washington at ; Matthew Benjamin in Washington at Last Updated: EDT Related Media on Demand Wolfowitz Says He Didn&#39;t Want to Set Companion&#39;s Pay Wachovia to Buy A.G.

Ruling Wednesday, Judge Maurice J. Gallipoli rejected West New York's argument that parade organizers were essentially running "a charitable fraud" that claimed to use the parade to raise money for scholarships and other charities but was actually a for-profit enterprise. Parade organizers and others had claimed the permit for Sunday's parade was denied for political reasons. They implied that Mayor Silverio Vega, who is running for state Senate in next Tuesday's primary, didn't want to march alongside another suburban mayor seeking the same seat. "It's been a tremendous ordeal through a mayor who was a little messed up in the head," parade founder Emilio Del Valle said after the ruling. Vega did not respond to a telephone message seeking comment. He previously said he would lie down in front of the marchers to keep them out. An attorney for Del Valle contended that Vega's decision to deny the permit amounted to a curtailment of First Amendment rights because it didn't reflect "any governmental purpose or concern" such as crowd control or safety.

For Matthew Evans, it was cause for joy. "My favorite word!" said the 12-year-old boy from Albuquerque, N.M. The 80th Scripps National Spelling Bee began by reducing the record field of 286 spellers to 59 on Wednesday. Those who survived will return for the semifinals and finals Thursday, and the champion will be crowned on prime-time national television. Most of the winnowing was done with a 25-word multiple-choice test, followed by three oral rounds that featured a display of confidence, nervousness and befuddlement &mdash; not to mention sheer relief when a guess proved correct. "Yes!" exclaimed 12-year-old Tia Thomas of Coarsegold, Calif., who pumped her fists and skipped back to her seat after correctly spelling "periostracum" (the hard covering of a mollusk shell). "I was pretty sure I knew the word," Tia said. "But the 'peri' part was guessing." Matthew and Tia, both in the national bee for the fourth time, are two of the favorites to become the champion. The winner receives $35,000 cash, a $5,000 scholarship, a $2,500 savings bond and a complete set of reference works. Achieving that goal will require outlasting 13-year-old Samir Patel of Colleyville, Texas, who is back for the fifth year after placing third, 27th, second and 14th. With his grandfather from India &mdash; visiting the United States for the first time &mdash; sitting on the front row, Samir breezed through "decor" in the preliminary round, and "trumpery" (of low quality) and "sunglo" (a green Chinese tea) in the quarterfinals. "I'm a lot more prepared than I was the first year," Samir said. "I'm not as nervous, and I already know sort of the routine, so I'm not so much worried about 'Am I going to be there on time?' 'Am I going to make a mistake in walking down the stage?'" Far removed from the glamour of the rounds that will be televised on ESPN and ABC on Thursday, the bee started early in the morning in a setting that more closely resembled a classroom of students taking the SAT. Spellers from English-speaking parts of the world filled in ovals with their No. 2 pencils during the multiple-choice test, which included words ranging from "icicle" to "ylem" (a hypothetical substance from the early universe). Matthew was happily surprised when he saw that the 25th word was Bewusstseinslage (a state of consciousness, pronounced bay-VOOHST-sines-lahg-eh), which he likes "just because it's so weird-sounding." "I was like, 'Oh my goodness. Wow! This is awesome,'" said Matthew, who got 24 of 25 correct. Then all of the spellers were given their only guaranteed moment on the Grand Hyatt's ballroom stage: a chance to spell one word before the audience of parents, friends and judges. "Macaroni &mdash; what does it mean?" asked 14-year-old Michael Yeh of Kokomo, Ind., exercising his right to ask for a definition before correctly spelling the popular food. The multiple choice test (worth 25 points) and the preliminary oral round (worth three points) narrowed the field to 107. Thirteen more were eliminated in the next round, and 35 heard the telltale bell signaling an incorrect response in the day's final round. Every year there are spellers who have their own quirks to help them stay focused. This year, some wrote letters in the air, others on their hands. Jonathan Horton, 14, of Gilbert, Ariz., who finished in a tie for sixth last year, has developed a rhythm in which he turns his head and appears to feign a cough several times while spelling a word. He did it four times while working through the 10 letters of "exhilarate." "I say a couple of letters into my hand, and then I say them out loud," said Jonathan, who also advanced to the semifinals. "I do that because I don't want to say the wrong letter out loud." Aishwarya Pastapur of Overland Park, Kan., made her feelings known by wearing a T-shirt with the words "mishpelt werds eeritate me." She displayed no irritation whatsoever by correctly spelling "enumerated" in the preliminaries, but she was stumped by "coadunation" (union of a large body) in the quarterfinals. Kennyi Aouad, 11, of Terre Haute, Ind., became a crowd favorite after he couldn't stop laughing when he was given the funky-sounding word "Sardoodledom" (a melodramatic plot). He finally composed himself and asked all sorts of questions about the word &mdash; definition, part of speech, alternate pronunciations, use in a sentence &mdash; then tried to get an unallowable hint by asking: "Is it kind of like kingdom?" He could hardly believe it when he spelled the word correctly.

http://www.connpost.com/localnews/ci_6015830&cid The Connecticut Post Online - Attackers kill 10, kidnap 5 in Iraq Top Business News (AP) Top News Headlines (AP) Attackers kill 10, kidnap 5 in Iraq RAVI NESSMAN Associated Press Article Last Updated: 05/29/2007 10:49:16 PM EDT BAGHDAD &#8212; Ten American soldiers, one with Connecticut ties, died in roadside bombings and a helicopter crash on Memorial Day, the military reported Tuesday, making May the deadliest month of the year for U.S. troops in Iraq. The helicopter crash claimed the life of a Norwich soldier, the governor's office said Tuesday. Army 1st Lt. Keith Heidtman, 24, was the 37th military member with Connecticut ties to die since the war began in 2002. Two Connecticut civilians have also been killed. Gov. M. Jodi Rell ordered all state and U.S. flags lowered to half-staff in Heidtman's honor. "Lt. Heidtman made the ultimate sacrifice for all of us, and he did so to protect the freedom that we so often take for granted," Rell said in a statement. "To have given his life on Memorial Day is especially poignant." Heidtman was one of 10 U.S. soldiers who died in roadside bombings and the helicopter crash on Monday, the military reported. The American deaths raised the number of U.S. forces killed this month to at least 113, according to an Associated Press count assembled from U.S. military statements. Eight of the soldiers were from Task Force Lightning &#8212; six killed when explosions hit near their vehicles and two in a helicopter crash. The military did not say if the helicopter was shot down or had mechanical problems. Heidtman was a 2001 graduate of Norwich Free Academy and a graduate of the University of Connecticut. His parents were notified Tuesday morning. He was the son of Kerry Heidtman and Maureen Robidoux. His stepfather is Art Robidoux. A phone message from the Associated Press was left at his family's home. "If you had to pick your son, this is who you would pick. He was handsome, he was bright," Kerry Heidtman told The Day of New London. Heidtman arrived in Iraq in December and was scheduled to come home for leave in July. "We're sending our finest, and we're losing them," Kerry Heidtman said. In other violence, five Britons were kidnapped Tuesday from an Iraqi government office in Baghdad, driven away in a 19-vehicle convoy filled with men in police uniforms who headed toward a Shiite stronghold in the capital, the British government and an Iraqi official said. The military said two Multi-National Division-Baghdad Soldiers were killed the same day when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb in southern Baghdad. The deaths were announced in three statements issued by the U.S. military public affairs office at Camp Victory at Baghdad Airport. Maj. Gen. Abdul-Karim Khalaf, the Interior Ministry spokesman, said the abduction at the Iraqi Finance Ministry office was carried out by men wearing police uniforms who showed up in 19 four-wheel drive vehicles of the type used by police. He said the band of kidnappers drove off toward Sadr City, the Shiite Mahdi Army stronghold in northeastern Baghdad. In London, a Foreign Office spokeswoman said the five people kidnapped Tuesday were British. The spokeswoman gave the information on condition of anonymity in line with government policy. A senior official in the Iraqi Interior Ministry confirmed the five were British, and that Mahdi Army militiamen were believed responsible. The official provided the information on condition that his name not be used. In McLean, Va., Steve Lunceford, a spokesman for the BearingPoint management consulting firm, said one of the kidnap victims worked for the company. The other four were employees with the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld, according to Joe Gavaghan, a spokesman for the Canadian company.

Bush's Texas ranch, says she is quitting and going home because she is as disgusted with the U.S. president's Democratic foes as with his Republican supporters. "This is my resignation letter as the 'face' of the American antiwar movement," she said in a letter posted Monday on a liberal website, dailykos.com. Cindy Sheehan, an American anti-war activist and the mother of a U.S. soldier who was killed in Iraq, stands on Parliament Hill after a news conference in Ottawa in May 2006. Monday was Memorial Day, the U.S. holiday commemorating members of the armed forces killed in war. Sheehan set up camp near the ranch after her son Casey, 24, was killed in an ambush in BaghdadÂ in 2004. She was "the darling of the so-called left as long as I limited my protests to George Bush and the Republican Party," she wrote. "Of course, I was slandered and libeled by the right as a 'tool' of the Democratic Party." But when she broke with the Democrats over their reluctance to cut off war funding, she found herself under fire from Democrat bloggers, she said. The U.S. troops in Iraq "have been abandoned there indefinitely by their cowardly leaders who move them around like pawns on a chessboard," she lamented, saying she would return to California to rebuild her life. "I am going to take whatever I have left and go home. I am going to go home and be a mother to my surviving children and try to regain some of what I have lost." She added: "I have been called every despicable name that small minds can think of and have had my life threatened many times. "The most devastating conclusion that I reached this morning, however, was that Casey did indeed die for nothing. "His precious lifeblood drained out in a country far away from his family who loves him, killed by his own country which is beholden to and run by a war machine that even controls what we think. "I have tried ever since he died to make his sacrifice meaningful. Casey died for a country which cares more about who will be the next American Idol than how many people will be killed in the next few months while Democrats and Republicans play politics with human lives."

This Week in Weddings Wedding of the Week Planning Ideas & Advice Perry appeals to Legislature to finish their work after walkout AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Governor Rick Perry appealed to state lawmakers today "to rise above their differences and finish the work of the people of Texas." His appeal came after a walkout by opponents of state House Speaker Tom Craddick walked out of the House in the pre-dawn hours today. That denied the chamber of a quorum and brought its work to a halt. The walkout was started by El Paso Representative Pat Haggerty. He is part of a group who claims Craddick has bent the rules in his favor to keep others from taking his seat as speaker. "This man is sitting here violating every rule of the house, every rule of parliamentary procedure to keep himself in office and it&#39;s wrong," stated Haggerty. Perry said the rupture in the House has "placed in serious jeopardy legislation that has statewide impact." He specified legislation addressing state water, border security, clean air,parks funding and energy policy. Another bill awaiting House action calls for mandatory random steroid tests for every high school athlete in the state. A rush of legislation is expected today as the Texas House and Senate hurry to get as much done as possible before the Legislature adjourns at midnight (Central time). Thirty-two bills are left on the schedule. Democratic state Representative Joaquin Castro and others who participated in the walkout say they could vote to suspend the rules to take up the legislation when they meet this afternoon.

As Council members took turns speaking on the issue, crowds booed, hissed and cheered, and the meeting was called to order several times. Adding to the drama, Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who is white, was chastised by Councilman Charles Barron, a Brooklyn Democrat and a former Black Panther, for her opposition to the measure. The Council voted down the measure 25-15, with seven abstentions. Staten Island's three-member contingent rejected the Carson street renaming. The tally broke down largely along racial lines, with only one vote to rename the street coming from a white member and all black members either voting for the renaming or abstaining. "This fairly innocuous bill, a street renaming ... sounds so innocuous, so routine, and yet now it's not that," said Councilman Albert Vann, a black Democrat from Bedford-Stuyvesant who spearheaded the measure. "You've hit a nerve. You're harking back to a time that we've already overcome. You're infringing upon our human right." Ms. Quinn, a Democrat, called Carson "divisive" in explaining her "no" vote. "If you look at the life and the full record of who Sonny Carson was, it was divisive. It is a record that is without apology. It is not a record which stood in full support and full solidarity for all New Yorkers of all races and religions," Ms. Quinn said, while the crowd fired jeers of "You didn't know him!" Carson, a Korean War veteran who died in 2002, led protests against police brutality, among other things. He was criticized for calling himself "anti-white," a quote Barron said was taken out of context by the media. Carson was arrested in 1974 on charges of murder, attempted murder and kidnapping -- prosecutors claimed he had ordered the revenge shootings of two men -- and convicted of kidnapping. Sentenced to seven years in prison, he served 15 months and became politically active following his release. Ms. Quinn, who is openly gay and is regarded as having liberal views, was on the end of a harangue by Barron and other black Council members. "You brought us to a place of divide that this City Council has never experienced," Barron said, often pointing a finger at her during his speech and refusing to stop when his two-minute time allotment ended.

That's a laugh | www.azstarnet.com Â® Make us your home page Thu, now, it's free! Buy Daily Star photo reprints Kennyi Aouad, 11, sees the funny side of things as he tries to spell "sardoodledom" â and succeeds. Jacquelyn Martin / the associated press Arizona's Jonathan Horton, 14, of Gilbert, who finished in a tie for sixth last year, advanced to the semifinals. Bert's Electric & Plumbing High School Dance Teacher 59 spellers dodge the deadly ding; 'sardoodledom'? That's a laugh Scripps Howard News Service Tucson, Arizona | Published: 05.31.2007 WASHINGTON â Humor and the horror of the fatal ding punctuated the Scripps National Spelling Bee's first day of competition here Wednesday. When the words settled, 59 out of 286 spellers were left standing. The battle continues this morning, with the semifinals on ESPN from 7 to 10 a.m. Tucson time. ABC will broadcast the finals at 7 p.m. in Tucson. This year marks the first time for metal detectors at the bee's site in a downtown Washington, D.C., hotel. Guards inspected all bags and stood ready to more closely examine anyone or anything setting off the detectors. Bee director Paige Kimble said the measures are "proactive, not reactive." Officials felt it was time to match security to the event's rising profile. The Wednesday afternoon quarterfinals brought a new enemy: the ding of a bell, the kind that could be sitting on any hotel counter. If the contestant got a word wrong, it was o-v-e-r, signaled by a ding. After that sound, a bee crew member shook the defeated speller's hand and led him off the stage. His next stop was the "comfort room," also known as the crying room, where the speller could come to terms with his loss in private. Expected to end by 5:30 p.m., the quarterfinals kept going until 6:20. Kimble said creating a bee schedule is a "guessing game." By the last 90 minutes, empty chairs had gone from a rarity to a trend onstage as the ever-more-difficult words decimated the ranks of the spellers. The contestants fidgeted in their chairs and played with their placards before falling into a line three deep behind the microphone. Shelley Clark's pigtails looked as if they were sagging while she struggled with "acuminate." The 13-year-old home-schooled student from Tigard, Ore., got the definition from the judge: "Tapering to a slender point. Pointed." "Is that from the Latin 'ad,' meaning towards?" she asked, dismissing any notion her brain was as tired as her pigtails. After acing the word, she was suddenly bursting with energy as she bounced back to her chair. Luck is a big factor in winning, and Lady Luck wasn't exactly smiling on Kennyi Aouad. That didn't stop him from grinning and outright cracking up. The 11-year-old sixth-grader at Otter Creek Middle School in Indiana was waiting at the microphone when the judge calmly lobbed "Sardoodledom" at him. A grin as bright as his red shirt immediately broke out on his face, and he started guffawing. The audience cracked up, too. "Sardoodledom?" Kennyi said, still chuckling. "Sardoodledom," the judge confirmed. "Sardoodle â ," Kennyi's giggles interrupted his efforts to repeat the word. He recovered and asked for the definition. "It's another word for melodrama," the judge said, in part. Kennyi's face turned solemn, and he asked for the language of origin. "It's from a French name," the judge said. The speller's lips moved silently. "Umm. Umm," he said. "Is it like kingdom?" Kennyi asked the judge. Then he took down the word, conquering it one letter at a time while the crowd listened in amazement. The boy dashed back to his seat, his arms raised in celebration. And, indeed, the crowd went wild. 0 Comments on this story $1 Sunday delivery - Subscribe to the Arizona Daily Star Letter to the editor â¢ sign up now U of A basketball coverage

(Paul Buckowski / Times Union) Identity of crash victim sought State soccer championships in Wilton Women's press group honors Bellevue CEO Model plane collectors take hobby to new heights Path to citizenship can be a test of patience, wallet $275 fee increase, new questions for naturalization exam leading to complaints Click byline for more stories by writer. First published: Thursday, -- While President Bush and Congress clash over federal immigration policy, there's good news and bad news on taking the test to become a U.S. citizen. New questions being finalized this summer appear to be easier, for some, than the old test questions. The citizenship test was last changed in 1986. On the downside, it will cost substantially more to take the test: $675, up from $400. The hike takes effect July 30 as part of substantial across-the-board increases in fees for immigration services ranging from green cards ($195 to $370) to permanent resident status ($325 to $1,010). There's a rising chorus of complaints over the fee hikes. "The fee increases put too much of a burden on the backs of the working poor," said Tom Shea, a staff attorney with the New York Immigration Coalition. While the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services receives about 5 million immigration form applications annually, a political battle continues to rage in Washington over what to do with the country's estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. Meanwhile, after six years of tinkering, new test questions are being finalized on what amounts to the final hurdle before naturalization. About 84 percent passed the old citizenship test on the first try according to a 2004 survey. About 95 percent passed a pilot test with new questions on the first try in a 10-city trial over the past six months. Albany was one of the test cities and the passage rate locally was slightly higher than the national average, according to Shawn Saucier, a bureau spokesman. "I got 10 out of 10 right and thought the new questions were really easy compared to the old test questions I had studied," said Charlene Amanda Knight, who took the test at the bureau's Latham office May 5. The person giving the citizenship test selects 10 questions out of a new pool of 100 that will be put in place next year. Passing the test requires answering six out of 10 questions correctly. A test taker gets two chances to pass the test. After that, the immigrant must reapply and pay the $675 fee again. There is no limit on how many times the test can be taken. In a typical year, the bureau receives about 1 million applications for citizenship and naturalizes about 700,000 people. In the Latham office, about 1,200 people are naturalized each year. Knight, 26, of Albany, works as an administrative assistant in the state Health Department. She held Jamaican citizenship but grew up mostly in the U.S. and was granted American citizenship Friday in a ceremony in Troy. Her parents, who live in Florida, had become citizens years earlier, but Knight's paperwork was lost in the immigration bureaucracy. "I kept putting off taking the test because I worried about studying for it and having to pay the fee," said Knight. "Mostly, I really wanted to be able to vote because I got tired of watching the news on Election Night without voting," Knight said. Warren Roberts, a distinguished professor of history at the University at Albany, found some of the new citizenship test questions unduly difficult. 50% off Times Union home delivery.

Letters to the Editor As Lake O level falls, so does business Lake O 'waiting for the rain' OKEECHOBEE &#151; Bubba Helton wonders how long he can keep his doors open. Larry Wright would love to take someone fishing. Wendy Woodman figures it's going to be a slow Fourth of July holiday. Lake Okeechobee tied a record low water level Wednesday &#151; 8.97 feet above sea level. But the water level isn't the only thing hitting bottom in this part of Central Florida. Businesses around the northern rim of the nation's second- largest freshwater lake also are seeing record lows. Retail sales, dinners served at area restaurants, motel/campsite bookings and rentals are well off the mark following a slower than average season &#151; January through April. And the summer slowdown might spell the end for some businesses. Helton blames a large portion of his lost business on mismanaged water and mis-modeled weather forecasting. "The Army Corps of Engineers and South Florida Water Management District don't know how to run the business they're in," said Helton, owner of Garrard's Bait and Tackle on 441 in Okeechobee. "For 18 months they dumped water out of the lake, and then we went into a natural drought." The low water levels have prevented anglers from taking fishing trips on Florida's most famed fishing lake. Although the fishing is good for bass and bluegill, almost no one can get out onto the lake since the waters have receded to the point where boat ramps empty onto dry ground. Helton said he knows of three tackle shops around the lake that already have closed their doors because of waning customer traffic, and he might not be that far behind if business doesn't pick up soon. Wright, a captain who has guided anglers to lunker largemouth bass for 26 years, hopes he can continue to make a living despite what he estimates as a 75 percent drop in charters. "In May last year, I worked 26 days," said Wright, 55. "This year, I had 10." He had 21 trips last June, but has only three on the books this year. Wright said few customers are coming from other states to fish because of the low water. "We get quite a few anglers from South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama who come here to fish this time of year," he said. "The moms and dads will get their high school kids fishing trips. They're just not coming. "They may think the lake is just completely dried up." Woodman, general manager of the K.O.A. Campground in Okeechobee, said the Memorial Day weekend wasn't too bad for bookings; however, Fourth of July reservations are off quite a bit. "Our business is impacted a little bit," Woodman said, "but we have guests who come here for activities besides fishing and boating." The way Helton sees it, the entire economy of Okeechobee is tied directly or indirectly to the level of the lake. "This doesn't only affect me," Helton said. "Motels, gas stations, grocery stores, even Wal-Mart has slower sales when the traffic is down." And Helton's unhappiness doesn't end with the water managers. "We've been let down by our county commissioners, congressmen, senators and governor," Helton said. "I don't care if there's a three-legged dog running in the next election, I'm voting against all of them." 3 (bookings to date) 41 bass, 48 bluegill and shellcracker 31 bass to 8 pounds Forecasters with the National Weather Service predict a roughly 40 percent chance of rain on Friday and a 50 percent chance of rain on Saturday. The South Florida Water Management District says even if it does rain, it would have to fall directly over the lake to help it rebound. Bubba Helton wonders how long he can keep his doors open.

Ties Record for Its Lowest Water Level; Lake Bed Burns Amid Drought Deep cracks cover the bottom of what should be five-feet deep Lake Okeechobe near Okeechobee, Fla. Tuesday as the drought continues statewide in Florida. Lake Okeechobee, a backup drinking water source for millions in South Florida and the lifeblood of the Everglades, is nearing a record low at 9.6 feet, four feet below average. &#40;J. Pat Carter/AP Photo&#41; By JENNIFER KAY Associated Press Writer MIAMI May 30, 2007 (AP) Water levels in dried-out Lake Okeechobee matched a historic low Wednesday while firefighters battled a blaze burning on part of the exposed lake bottom. The South Florida Water Management District expected the record of 8.97 feet from May 24, 2001, to evaporate by Thursday as the region's worst known drought continues. The average water level should be around 13 feet this time of year in the second-largest freshwater lake in the contiguous United States. The 12,000-acre fire started Monday in the vegetation left to dry in the sun as waters receded from the lake's northwest rim, said Melissa Yunas, a spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Forestry. "All the water is not there. Now it's just vegetation, all dried out, just sitting on the side of the lake," Yunas said. The cause of the fire was unknown. It was about 50 percent contained, Yunas said. Lake Okeechobee is a backup drinking water source for millions of people in South Florida and the lifeblood of the Everglades. The region is largely dependent on the lake during dry periods, when it can be used as a reservoir. "The Everglades are also in a drought. We've totally lost the backup for the water supply for the east coast" of Florida, said Carol Wehle, executive director of the water management district. An above-average rainy season is needed to replenish the lake and South Florida's groundwater system, officials said. Only about 7-8 inches of rain have fallen on the region in the past five months, about half of normal totals. No significant rainfall was expected over the lake or the Kissimmee River valley to its north before Thursday night, according to the National Weather Service. The drought has forced stringent water restrictions on homes and businesses in 13 counties, and four coastal wells were closed to prevent saltwater contamination. The drought has allowed officials to begin clearing 500,000 cubic yards of rotted plant life and sediment from the southwest portion of the 730-square-mile lake to return its bottom to a more sandy base, improve water quality and restore wildlife habitat.

Of those, five would grow into major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher with winds over 110 mph (177 kph), the team founded by forecast pioneer William Gray said in its revised forecast. The updated forecast issued on Thursday was unchanged from the team's April 3 forecast for the six-month storm season that starts on Friday. The researchers said there was a 74 percent chance that at least one major hurricane would hit the U.S. coastline in 2007, with a 50 percent chance that would happen on the U.S. Atlantic Coast and a 49 percent chance on the Gulf of Mexico coast. An average season brings 11 tropical storms, with six reaching hurricane wind speed of 74 mph (119 kph) and two growing into major hurricanes. Other private and government weather researchers have also predicted a more active season than average. But so far none have forecast anything like a repeat of record-breaking 2005, when 28 tropical storms spawned 15 hurricanes, including Katrina which flooded New Orleans and parts of the Gulf coast. news is provided by INSTANT VIEW-Reaction to Bush on climate change FACTBOX-Security developments in Iraq, May 31 May toll for U.S. soldiers in Iraq climbs to 122 Israel, militants exchange limited fire in Gaza FACTBOX-Five facts about hurricanes Catholic Relief Services commends President's call to double PEPFAR funding Source: CRS - USA World Vision Lauds Bush Global AIDS Funding Proposal Source: WV - USA Catholic Relief Services urges Congress to preserve US long-term development food aid initiatives that fight chronic hunger Source: CRS - USA Red Cross Awards Charity for Relief Donations!

http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7007504139&cid AHN | Guantanamo Bay Prisoner Dies In Apparent Suicide | news for the digital world Guantanamo Bay Prisoner Dies In Apparent Suicide a.m. EST Mary K. Brunskill - AHN Staff Writer San Juan, Puerto Rico (AHN) - A Saudi Arabian inmate at Guantanamo Bay prison was found dead in an apparent suicide Wednesday, the U.S. military's Southern Command said in a statement. The military did not identify the prisoner's name or exactly how he died. "The detainee was found unresponsive and not breathing in his cell by guards," the statement read. Critics of the prison camp said suicides are not surprising considering Guantanamo's treatment of its prisoners. Detainees at the camp are not able to access U.S. civilian courts and spend up to 22 hours a day isolated in their cells. AP quotes Michael Ratner, president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, as saying, "You have five and a half years of desperation there with no legal way out. Sadly, it leads to people taking their own lives." On June 10, 2006, three Guantanamo prisoners hanged themselves with bed sheets. Since then authorities at the camp have tried to avoid suicides by taking sheets away during the daytime and preventing access to light fixtures. Copyright © AHN Media Corp - All rights reserved.

Arguing that Libby deserves jail time, Fitzgerald says Plame was a covert agent. May 29, 2007 - In new court filings, special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald has finally resolved one of the most disputed issues at the core of the long-running CIA leak controversy: Valerie Plame Wilson, he asserts, was a âcovertâ CIA officer who repeatedly traveled overseas using a âcover identityâ in order to disguise her relationship with the agency. Fitzgerald cites Wilsonâs covert status as part of his argumentâadvanced in two strongly worded memos filed in recent daysâthat I. Lewis (Scooter) Libby, Vice President Dick Cheneyâs former chief of staff, should be sentenced to up to three years in prison. Libby was convicted last March of four counts of obstruction of justice, false statements and perjury relating to what he knew, and with whom he shared information, about Valerie Plame Wilson in the weeks prior to her outing by columnist Robert Novak in a July 14, 2003, newspaper column. Libby, who is appealing the verdict, is due to be sentenced next Tuesday by U.S. Judge Reggie Waltonâan event that could well reignite a fierce political controversy over whether President Bush should pardon the former Cheney aide. Libbyâs lawyers, and many conservative partisans of his cause, have argued that Libby should be spared prison in part because there was no underlying crime in the disclosure of Valerie Wilsonâs identity. (As his trial established, Wilsonâs identity was leaked to a number of reporters by several Bush administration officials who were interested in discrediting the attacks by her husband, former ambassador Joseph Wilson, on the White Houseâs handling of Iraq pre-war intelligence.)

Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry, identified Abdul Rahman Maadha al-Amry as the man who was found dead in his cell Wednesday at the detention facility. Although the U.S. military has identified the cause of death as "apparent suicide," Al-Turki said that it was too early to judge how al-Amry died. A Saudi human rights society confirmed al-Amry&#039;s identity Thursday and blamed the U.S. for his death. "The U.S. administration is responsible for the recent death of the Saudi national that followed previous similar deaths that took place in the same prison," the Saudi National Society for Human Rights said in a statement. Today in Africa &#038; Middle East Jihadist groups fill a Palestinian power vacuum UN Security Council approves Hariri tribunal Sunni-Kurdish conflict worsens Iraqi disarray The group, which was founded three years ago to defend human rights in the kingdom, called for "an independent and neutral investigation on the circumstances of the death of Abdul Rahman Maadha al-Amry in the Guantanamo detention center." The society also called for "the release of all detainees, who spent five years in the prison without legal evidence and for an immediate closure of the detention camp which has become, because of the continued physical and psychological torture, a mark of shame on the forehead of humanity." "Leaving the detainees in prison for more than five years without trial or release is a flagrant violation of human rights principles," it said. A lawyer for several Saudi detainees in Guantanamo expressed skepticism Thursday about the U.S. military&#039;s claim that al-Amry&#039;s death was a suicide. "At the time, we announce our reservation to the American story and our doubts about its credibility," said Katib al-Shammary in a statement. "We call on the American authorities to quickly unveil the reason behind the death of Abdul Rahman Maadha al-Amry." "We stress on the necessity of carrying out an independent investigation by international and human rights organizations to determine the reasons behind the death of al-Amry and the two other detainees, Mani and al-Zahrani," al-Shammary said. The lawyer was referring to Mani Shaman Turki al-Habardi and Yassar Talal al-Zahrani who apparently committed suicide in the Guantanamo Bay prison in June. He said U.S. authorities have not yet answered questions from a Saudi medical committee about the deaths of the two Saudis.

The 64-year-old, who joins a crowded field of Republican contenders, told newspaper USA Today about his campaign plans, ending months of speculation. He is already well known for his role as a district attorney in TV series Law & Order, and has been polling well. Mr Thompson is expected to launch a "testing the waters" committee in the next few days to start fundraising. The former two-term senator for Tennessee has already been hiring staff, making speeches and setting up a strong internet presence. Reports began circulating on Wednesday that he had decided to make official his informal but already attention-grabbing initiatives towards running for president. "I can't remember exactly the point I said, 'I'm going to do this'," Mr Thompson told USA Today in an interview published on Thursday. "But when I did, that thing that occurred to me: 'I'm going to tell people that I'm thinking about it and see what kind of reaction I get to it'." Mr Thompson has already been attracting attention with speeches He told the paper that his late start to campaigning carried "certain advantages", not least that his use of the internet "has allowed me to be in the hunt, so to speak, without spending a dime". Observers say he could pose a threat to all three of the main contenders for the Republican nomination, Senator John McCain, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Some polls have put him at second or third place among potential Republican voters struggling to decide who to back in a field of almost a dozen candidates. He has strong conservative credentials on issues such as gun control and abortion and, while he voted in 2002 to authorise the Iraq invasion, he is not as closely associated with the war as some of his rivals. His charisma and ability to perform for the crowds are expected to stand him in good stead on the campaign trail. Inevitably, parallels have been drawn between Mr Thompson and another actor-turned-politician, Ronald Reagan. The actor has asked to leave Law & Order, where he has played the astute, fatherly New York District Attorney Arthur Branch for the past five seasons, in order to concentrate on politics. He is also known to viewers for roles in the films The Hunt for Red October, in which he played a US Navy admiral, Last Best Chance and In the Line of Fire.

Victoria Cavaliere reports from VOA's New York bureau. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit Wednesday in a federal court in California. The suit accuses Jeppesen Dataplan, a subsidiary of the giant Boeing Corporation, of knowingly providing the CIA with flight plans and travel logistics in order to shuttle terror suspects to foreign prisons for interrogation. The practice, known as "extraordinary rendition," has been widely criticized by human rights groups for leaving terror suspects in the hands of countries that alledgedly torture them. The CIA is not named in the suit. The ACLU's lawsuit centers on what it claims is the rendering and mistreatment of three men. The first, Binyam Mohamed, is an Ethiopian citizen who was imprisoned in Morrocco in 2002 and is now held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen, was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and also sent to Morrocco. The third client, Ahmed Agiza, is an Egyptian citizen, allegedly picked-up in Sweden, and sent back to Egypt, where he was jailed and tortured. Anthony Romero, the executive director of the ACLU, says Jeppesen knowingly and willingly participated in the renditions. "American corporations should not be profiting from a CIA rendition program that is unlawful and contrary to core American values," said Anthony Romero. "Corporations that choose to participate in such activity can and should be held legally accountable." Jeppesen provides flight plans and support services, such as crews, to pilots and airline companies. A spokesman for Jeppesen told VOA the company has thousands of customers, and does not always know why their services have been contracted. The ACLU says it was referred to the three defendants in the suit through their foreign attorneys. Ben Weisner, a lawyer with the ACLU,says all three are still incarcerated, and none have been charged. "If the United States government had any actual evidence rather than innuendo that any of these men were involved in terrorism, they should have flown them to the United States and put them on trial, rather than send them to countries where they knew they would face torture," said Ben Weisner. Washington has acknowledged the secret transfer of suspects to third countries but denies torturing them or handing them over to countries that do. The United States says it does not condone the use of torture. Also Wednesday, the ACLU announced it is petitioning the Supreme Court to review the case of Khaled El-Masri, a German citizen who says he was kidnapped by the CIA in Macedonia in 2003, then flown to a secret jail in Afghanistan, where he was allegedly tortured by his U.S. captors. His lawyers say he was released when the CIA realized it had the wrong man. Al-Masri sued the CIA, but the case was dismissed after the U.S. government invoked the "state secrets privilege," a defense that maintains a trial would jeopardize national security.

Reputed Ku Klux Klansman James Ford Seale is charged with kidnapping and conspiracy in the 1964 abduction and slaying of two black teenagers in southwest Mississippi. Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee were beaten and dumped, still alive, into the Mississippi River. Seale, now 71, faces potentially damaging testimony from Charles Marcus Edwards, another reputed Klansman charged with him 43 years ago, before the state dropped its investigation. Prosecutors say Edwards has been granted immunity, and his cooperation is believed to be crucial to the revival of the investigation. This is the latest of more than a dozen civil rights-era cases that have been prosecuted across the South since the early 1990s. Seale arrived at the courthouse Wednesday wearing an orange jail jumpsuit. Before entering the courtroom, his shackles were removed and he put on khaki pants and a light blue dress shirt. He sat quietly in court, listening through wishbone-shaped earphones to amplify the sound because of hearing problems. When he left the courthouse later, his jail jumpsuit was topped by a bullet-resistant vest. The first day of jury selection brought a Faulknerian cast of characters that reflect Mississippi's rural roots and modern anxieties. Among the 21 people dismissed from the initial group of 76 potential jurors were a one-armed chicken grower who said he needs to tend to his poultry to pay his bills, a young woman in a Confederate flag T-shirt whose daddy injured his back when he fell off a roof and a farmer who has to care for his cows every day - especially now that it's birthing season and one of the calves arrived headfirst last week. Some people said they were battling alcohol or severe anxiety. One who remained in the jury pool said he's helping rebuild Gulf Coast parks damaged 21 months ago by Hurricane Katrina. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate is keeping jurors' names a secret at the request of prosecutors who said some might fear to serve in a case involving the Klan. One potential juror from rural southwest Mississippi cried as she listed a litany of hardships - her husband works on an offshore oil rig, there's no one else to care for their young daughter while he's gone. The woman said she has hardly been able to sleep since she received her jury summons and she's too scared to drive in Jackson's traffic. About the Real Cities Network About the McClatchy Company

Saves you money. Makes you smarter. The News Tribune, Tacoma, WA - Thursday, May 31st, 2007 1:24 AM BLOG: The Prep Blog Wall Street Journal Sunday Letters to the editor BLOG: Inside the Editorial Page Nation & World Photos Bars & night life BLOG: Bring the Noise With the Strykers in Iraq Inside the Editorial Page Online in the South Sound Riding Around the Sound Open House: Real estate Today's full text obituaries Place an In Memoriam Three more from Fort Lewis die MICHAEL GILBERT; The News Tribune Published: May 31st, 2007 01:00 AM Three more Fort Lewis soldiers have been killed in Iraq, the Department of Defense announced Wednesday. They were identified as: &#8226; Staff Sgt. Thomas M. McFall, 36, of Glendora, Calif. &#8226; Pfc. Junior Cedeno Sanchez, 20, of Miami. &#8226; Pfc. Charles B. Hester, 23, of Cataldo, Idaho. McFall and Cedeno Sanchez were killed in Baghdad on Monday, Memorial Day, when a bomb exploded nearby as they patrolled on foot, according to a Pentagon news release. Hester was killed two days earlier when a bomb detonated near his vehicle. The deaths bring to 19 the number of soldiers the post has lost in Iraq this month, more than in any other month since the invasion in March 2003. The May casualty total is now more than double Fort Lewis&#8217; previous worst month since the invasion: December 2004, when nine soldiers were killed. Fort Lewis has 10,000 soldiers in Iraq &#8211; likewise more than at any time in the war. Nearly all are deployed in two Stryker brigades in Baghdad and in Diyala province just to the northeast of the capital, scene of some of the deadliest insurgent attacks the past two months. Hester was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, which is part of the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division &#8211; a Stryker brigade that&#8217;s been in Iraq since last June. It&#8217;s expected to remain there into October. McFall and Cedeno Sanchez were assigned to the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, a part of the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. It left Fort Lewis in April and arrived in Iraq early this month. The brigade has lost nine soldiers now in the first month of what is expected to be a 15-month deployment. Twenty-eight soldiers from the 3rd Brigade have been killed in nearly a year. McFall&#8217;s wife, Emily, in a statement through the post public affairs office, described her husband as &#8220;a proud dad, a great son and a friend to many.&#8221; He was renowned for his barbecued ribs and his fondness for classic rock and cold beer, she said. They had soldiers over often, especially at the holidays. &#8220;He would go into a bar, bathroom, store, anywhere, and someone would start talking to him like they knew him,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He could always put a positive spin on anything. He made me and a lot of other people better just by knowing him. &#8220;He loved the brotherhood, and his heart beat red, white, and blue,&#8221; Emily McFall said. &#8220;There was only one exit for him.&#8221; A post spokesman said McFall joined the Army in 1994 and was assigned to Fort Bragg, N.C. He then spent a year in South Korea and was at Fort Lewis in the late 1990s before going to Hawaii and deploying to Afghanistan for a year in 2004-05. Cedeno Sanchez joined the Army in November 2005 and arrived at Fort Lewis the following June. Hester enlisted in May 2004 and arrived at Fort Lewis that September and deployed with the 3rd Brigade last June. Hester and Cedeno Sanchez were serving on their first combat tours. Two other soldiers suffered minor injuries in the attack that killed Hester, but they returned to duty, officials said. No memorial ceremony at Fort Lewis has been set for the three Stryker soldiers. Brig. Gen. William Troy, the acting post commander, last week wrote a memo saying that memorials now would be consolidated once a month, so presumably these three men will be memorialized together in late June.

Peace will only come when one or the other side is totally wiped out or one side totally fears the fighting capacity of the other and will cease resistance.

"We have expanded the scope of our investigation to include allegations regarding improper political or other considerations in hiring decisions within the Department of Justice," Inspector General Glenn Fine and H. Marshall Jarrett, head of the Office of Professional Responsibility, wrote in letters to the House and Senate Judiciary committees. The widening inquiry is likely to pose an additional challenge for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who is already facing lawmakers' calls for his resignation and a potential no-confidence vote by the Senate. While the U.S. attorney dismissals have prompted wide political criticism, improper hiring practices could be deemed a violation of the law. Justice officials had previously disclosed that the internal investigation would include hiring decisions made by Monica Goodling, a former Gonzales aide who confirmed last week in Senate testimony that she "crossed the line" in considering political affiliation when hiring career prosecutors and immigration judges. Federal law and department rules bar taking such affiliations into account in hiring career personnel, the Justice Department has said. Wednesday's letter revealed that the internal inquiry will examine the hiring practices of Justice officials besides Goodling and outside the attorney general's office. The expansion comes in the wake of claims by former Justice officials that selections by the Attorney General's Honors Program and the department's Summer Law Intern Program were rigged in favor of candidates with connections to conservative or Republican groups. In response, the department this spring agreed to place them back under the control of career officials. The programs were overseen last year by Michael Elston, chief of staff to Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty, and both Elston and McNulty approved the recent reforms. The inquiry will also look at hiring practices within the Civil Rights Division, which has seen the departure of dozens of career lawyers. The career personnel repeatedly clashed with Bush administration political appointees, who overruled them on pivotal voting-rights cases in Georgia and Texas. One former senior official in the Civil Rights Division, Bradley Schlozman, replaced one of the fired U.S. attorneys &#8212; Todd Graves of Kansas City, Mo. &#8212; and attracted controversy by indicting four workers involved in a voter-registration drive sponsored by a liberal group days before the November elections. A Gonzales spokesman declined to comment on the broadening of the probe. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate panel, said in a statement that it reinforces "the need for meaningful congressional oversight of this Justice Department and the Bush administration."

Jim Tracy, the county's highest-ranking Republican, said Wednesday night he welcomes signs that former U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson is about to enter the presidential fray. Thompson, whose possible candidacy has been a topic of speculation for months, revealed plans this week to form an exploratory committee, the first step towards a presidential campaign. He has also announced that he is leaving his role on the TV drama "Law & Order." "I've known Fred pretty much all my life," said Tracy. "I think he'll make a great candidate, and I think folks from all parts of the political spectrum can support Fred." Tracy praised Thompson as "very intelligent, a good communicator ... a strong leader." Tracy said he agrees with Thompson on most issues. "He'll gain a lot of support," said Tracy, who represents Bedford, Moore and part of Rutherford counties in the General Assembly. Thompson, 64, is thought to appeal to conservatives unhappy with the three GOP front-runners, Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney and John McCain. Thompson will make his first formal campaign move in the coming days, establishing an official organization to weigh a White House bid while launching a major fundraising drive on Monday, according to several Republicans with knowledge of his plans. Speaking on condition of anonymity because the timeline is not public, these officials said Thompson may visit early primary states in late June and could officially enter the race as early as the first week in July. "Senator Thompson is still seriously considering getting into the presidential contest and he is doing everything he has to do to make that final decision," said Mark Corallo, a Thompson spokesman. "Stay tuned." On Thompson's schedule in the coming weeks: a speech to Virginia Republicans in Richmond on Saturday and an appearance on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" on June 12. One official said an overseas trip also may be in the works. For months, Thompson has openly flirted with a candidacy as a Tennessee-based effort sought to draft him into the race. He made several high-profile moves that pointed to a bid, not the least of which was disclosing that he is in remission after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a form of cancer. His popularity in national polls spiked to double digits early in the year, but while he still fares well in surveys, his numbers have fallen following what some Republicans considered a subpar speech in early May in California. Thompson was elected to the Senate in 1994, defeating then-Shelbyville resident Jim Cooper for the open seat which had once belonged to Vice President Al Gore. During his Senate tenure, which ended in 2002, Thompson was considered a reliably conservative vote. He worked to limit the role of the federal government and backed a ban on a late-term abortion procedure. He voted in favor of Bush's tax cuts, oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, eliminating money for the National Endowment for the Arts and a constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration. And, he voted against requiring criminal background checks for purchases at gun shows. But he sometimes took paths that didn't necessarily sit well with conservatives, including advocating for campaign finance reform. While he voted to oust President Clinton from office, he also was one of 10 Republican senators who voted against one of the two impeachment charges. Social issues, important to the party's right, also typically weren't at the top of his agenda. He was known less as a legislator and more as an investigator, leading the committee that examined former President Clinton's fundraising in 1996. Yet, he established a reputation as a less-than-hard worker. The Democratic National Committee issued a research document Wednesday detailing Thompson's major legislative accomplishments. Save for the title and a DNC disclaimer, it was blank. Thompson was one of the few senators who backed underdog McCain in 2000 over George W. Bush, the establishment candidate. This time around, Thompson would be opposing McCain -- and could hurt his friend's own shot at the White House. The two have similar Senate records but Thompson could be seen as a fresher face to McCain, who is well-known to GOP voters. Romney, who is trying to position himself to the right of the major candidates, also could see his support fall among conservatives concerned about his shifts on issues. Campaigning in Iowa, Romney said he welcomed a Thompson entry. "I think he'll make the race more interesting. He's got good ideas and after all, he does put bad people in jail every week on 'Law & Order,"' he said. Giuliani could be hindered as well if Thompson grabs the attention of Republicans uneasy with the former New York City mayor's support for gay and abortion rights. Over the next few days, Thompson plans to form a "testing the waters" committee called "Friends of Fred Thompson," which will allow him to begin raising money, hire staff and gauge support without officially committing to a White House bid. He could significantly dampen the fundraising ability of his potential GOP rivals during the homestretch of the second quarter financial reporting period. "It's going to cause everybody to have second thoughts about writing a check," said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist who is unaligned in the race. Thompson spoke on a conference call Wednesday to several dozen people who officials called "First Day Founders" and said committed to raising money for him. Participants said they were asked to raise $46,000 apiece, the $2,300 maximum from 10 couples or 20 people. Officials cautioned that Thompson has made no final decision.
http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/67542.html&cid Hike in immigration fees announced Hike in immigration fees announced Wed, 30 May 2007 09:12:00GMT US World News | The US federal agency in charge of immigration visas has announced a hike in immigration application fees starting July 30. The rise will mean that immigrants will have to pay almost double the fee to get the citizenship of the country or three times the current fee to become a permanent resident. On an average, the new fees will see an increase of almost 66 percent, which the immigration agency is necessary to allow it to function. "The reason we're raising the fees, short answer, is that we need the money. A lot of people are going to be affected by this, there's no sugarcoating it", said Emilio T. Gonzales, director of Citizenship and Immigration Services. Gonzales said that with the system devised by the Congress, which wants immigrants to pay most of the money required for the processing of citizenship, means that almost 99 percent of agency's budget is supported by immigrant fees. However this is falling short of the needs of the overloaded agency. According to the new fees, the cost of getting a green card has increased from $325 to $930, while acquiring citizenship papers will cost $675, up from $330. Bringing a foreign fiance or fiancee would be paying $455 instead of the current fee of $170. Gonzales revealed that the hike in fees will allow the agency to rope in an extra 1,500 immigration officers as well as allow the opening 39 new facilities, whose main aim will be to process green cards or citizenship applications in a maximum time limit of just six months. However leaders of immigration advocacy groups are unhappy with the hike in immigration fees and say that the payment might be beyond the reach of low-income Hispanic families. "This is a fundamentally flawed system of financing our immigration services. It places an unfair burden on folks who want to become citizens and participate in all the nation has to offer", said William Ramos, director of Washington's National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund.

After nearly two years as one of the most prominent members of the American antiwar movement, activist Cindy Sheehan announced the end of her protests Monday, on Memorial Day. , published on the progressive blog , Ms. Sheehan, whose son Casey died in Iraq on April 4, 2004, lamented that her work for peace had been in vain. "I have invested everything I have into trying to bring peace with justice to a country that wants neither. ... The most devastating conclusion that I reached this morning, however, was that Casey did indeed die for nothing. ... Casey died for a country which cares more about who will be the next American Idol than how many people will be killed in the next few months while Democrats and Republicans play politics with human lives. It is so painful to me to know that I bought into this system for so many years and Casey paid the price for that allegiance. I failed my boy and that hurts the most. ... This is my resignation letter as the "face" of the American anti-war movement. This is not my "Checkers" moment, because I will never give up trying to help people in the world who are harmed by the empire of the good old US of A, but I am finished working in, or outside of this system." Among the reasons for her retirement, Ms. Sheehan wrote that her efforts had drained her finances, ended her 29-year marriage, strained her relationship with her three remaining children, and took a serious toll on her health that left her with substantial debt from medical expenses. Congress's decision to continue financing the war without a definite date for troop withdrawal also played a major role in her decision. Sheehan first captured public attention when she set up a camp outside President George Bush's ranch near Crawford, Texas, for 26 days starting in August 2005 . She demanded that the president tell her why her son had died in Iraq. From there she traveled the world demonstrating against American involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. The New York Times helped to give new depth to the average American's wartime sacrifices and spur the antiwar movement. Ms. Sheehan walked through Crawford that summer carrying pictures of her son as a toddler and in his Army fatigues, humanizing the war dead, who had remained in many ways invisible to large segments of the American public. Her intransigence in the face of Secret Service agents and senior Bush administration officials who tried to mollify her was a crucial element in what at the time was a small and incipient antiwar movement. Although these early efforts helped the antiwar movement grow from grass roots to mainstream, Sheehan quickly became a controversial figure. Her outspoken nature and attacks that transcended party lines caused many antiwar activists to view her as a liability. Consequently, the reports that despite her contributions, the antiwar movement will not struggle without Sheehan Anti-war leaders praised her bravery in putting a human face on the war's toll, but said the movement will not be derailed by her departure. Analysts said Sheehan has become an increasingly polarizing figure since staging her impromptu "Camp Casey" in Crawford, Texas, in August 2005, especially after she appeared with Bush-bashing Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez and announced that she would not pay federal income taxes to support the war. "She did a tremendous thing in that she took her personal loss and made it public, so that people could understand the cost of the war," said Nita Chaudhary, an anti-Iraq-war organizer for MoveOn.org. Sheehan had criticized MoveOn in March for not doing enough to oppose the war. "The anti-war movement is now the person next door, it's not just Cindy Sheehan," Chaudhary said. The resignation has pleased a number of Sheehan's critics, many of whom accused her of exploiting her son's death and profaning his memory. spoke with one of her opponents who believes the antiwar movement to better serve their needs. Kristinn Taylor, spokesman for FreeRepublic.com, which has held pro-troop rallies and counter-protests of anti-war demonstrations, said dwindling crowds at Sheehan's Crawford protests since her initial vigil may have led to her decision. But he also said he hopes she will now be able to heal. "Her politics have hurt a lot of people, including the troops and their families, but most of us who support the war on terror understand she is hurt very deeply," Taylor said Tuesday. "Those she got involved with in the anti-war movement realize it was to their benefit to keep her in that stage of anger." Despite Sheehan's exit from the antiwar movement, she does not appear to be departing from the public stage. On Tuesday she appeared on The Ed Schultz Show , a progressive radio program, and said that she plans to redirect her efforts to greater humanitarian causes In an interview with , Sheehan's sister spoke about Cindy Sheehan's sister, DeDe Miller, told CNN that the group would continue working for humanitarian causes, but drop its involvement in the anti-war movement. As for her sister's letter, Miller said, "She cried for quite a bit after writing it."

"American corporations should not be profiting from a CIA rendition program that is unlawful and contrary to core American values," said Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, seen here in December 2006. A leading US civil liberties group filed a lawsuit against a subsidiary of aircraft manufacturer Boeing on Wednesday, alleging involvement in the CIA's secret transfer of terrorist suspects. The American Civil Liberties Union filed the case against Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc., on behalf of three alleged targets of the US Central Intelligence Agency's controversial "extraordinary rendition" program. The lawsuit charges that Jeppesen knowingly provided flight services to the CIA that enabled the transportation of Ethiopian Binyam Mohamed, Italian Abou Elkassim Britel and Egyptian Ahmed Agiza to secret locations. Once in the secret overseas locations, the three were subjected to torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, the group alleges. "American corporations should not be profiting from a CIA rendition program that is unlawful and contrary to core American values," said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. "Corporations that choose to participate in such activity can and should be held legally accountable," he added. The complaint alleges that Jeppesen was one of the main providers of logistical support services for aircraft used by the CIA. The program allegedly involved US agents abducting terrorist suspects and moving them to secret locations around the world where they were routinely tortured or otherwise abused. According to the lawsuit, Jeppesen provided logistical support such as itinerary, route, weather, and fuel planning for 70 such flights since 2001. "Jeppesen's services have been crucial to the functioning of the government's extraordinary rendition program," said Steven Watt, one of the American Civil Liberties Union's attorneys. "Without the participation of companies like Jeppesen, the program could not have gotten off the ground," he said. The lawsuit was filed under the Alien Tort Statute, a law permitting aliens to bring claims in the United States for violations of other countries' laws or US treaties.

Sheehan, whose son Casey died fighting in Iraq in 2004, became an anti-war icon when she camped outside President George W. Bushâs ranch in Crawford, Texas, in 2005. Since then, she has travelled across the country, imploring the government to end the occupation in Iraq. Her announcement came in the form of a blog posting Monday on the Daily Kos, a popular liberal blog. Sheehan wrote in the blog entry that she had sacrificed her 29-year marriage, strained relationships with her remaining children and accumulated countless hospital bills during her effort to end the American occupation in Iraq, a cause for which she said she now believes her son died in vain. âThe most devastating conclusion that I reached this morning, however, was that Casey did indeed die for nothing,â Sheehan wrote. While Sheehanâs primary grievance was with the American handling of the occupation in Iraq, her often outspoken attacks were not targeted solely at the Republican party. She drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans who often criticized her actions as a ploy to draw attention. âThe first conclusion is that I was the darling of the so-called left as long as I limited my protests to George Bush and the Republican party,â Sheehan wrote in the blog entry. âHowever, when I started to hold the Democratic party to the same standards that I held the Republican party, support for my cause began to erode and the âleftâ started labeling me with the same slurs that the right used.â Sheehanâs decision to abandon her role in the anti-war movement comes after Congress passed a bill that would continue funding for the war last week. âI think Sheehan was talking about a part of the peace movement that had faith in the Democrats,â said Zanne Joi, a Berkeley resident who is an activist with Code Pink, a womenâs peace organization. âThe Democrats had the responsibility to deny (the president) that money and they had a mandate from the people to deny him that money.â Joi said Sheehanâs decision is a loss to the anti-war cause, but that the peace movement will likely continue until the troops return from Iraq. âIt is a loss but it provides an opportunity for other people to step forward and occupy that vacuum,â Joi said. Sheehan wrote in the blog entry that she hopes to mend the relationships she has damaged and regain what she has lost back at home. âIâve been wondering why Iâm killing myself and wondering why the Democrats caved in to George Bush,â Sheehan told The Associated Press Tuesday. âIâm going home for a while to try and be normal.â Contact Vincent Quan at vquan@dailycal.org.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/6-3&fd=R&url=http://cooperator.com/articles/1287/1/The-Mighty-Quinn/Page1.html&cid=1116778683&ei=muxeRqKEDZGoqwPX6vjNDQ A Look at the New City Council Speaker Remove from 'Articles to Read' Add to 'Articles to Read' Considering that she&#8217;s still a few months away from turning 40, Christine Quinn, Speaker of the New York City Council, has achieved a great deal in politics and is thought of as the second most powerful figure in city government, after the mayor himself. Quinn, a Democrat, first entered the council in 1999, and battled Brooklyn Councilman Bill de Blasio for the speaker seat. Quinn was elected speaker in January of this year by a wide margin, replacing former speaker Gifford Miller. Quinn, the first woman and first openly gay councilperson to be elected speaker, joked about the enormity if the position on the day she took office. &#8220;It&#8217;s completely daunting and overwhelming to the verge of nausea,&#8221; Quinn joked on that day to the media. &#8220;But that&#8217;s OK, because it should be. It&#8217;s that big of a job.&#8221; The Road to Speaker Christine Quinn was born into a typical Irish family in Glen Cove, Long Island. Her father was an electrical engineer and a shop steward for Local 44 of the International Union of Electrical Workers. Her late mother was a social worker for Catholic Charities. Quinn has often said that growing up in her house, political discussions were commonplace around the dinner table, and serving and helping people were family priorities. Growing up, Quinn was always interested in learning about government. &#8220;The only thing I was ever interested in was politics,&#8221; Quinn told the Daily News this past January. &#8220;I would go to the library and always take out biographies on political people.&#8221; Quinn attended Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut and graduated with a degree in urban studies and education. She began work as an activist directly out of college, and began leaving her mark on citywide housing issues as head of the Housing Justice Campaign for the Association of Neighborhood and Housing Development. Before being elected to the City Council, Quinn served for five years as chief of staff to Councilman Thomas K. Duane, who became the first out gay and HIV-positive person elected to the City Council in 1991. She began as his housing organizer, then campaign manager and when Duane was elected to the state Senate in 1998, Quinn won a special election the following February to succeed him. She was just 33 at the time. As a councilperson, Quinn represented the 3rd Council District, which encompasses Chelsea (where Quinn currently lives with her partner Kim), the West Village, Clinton/Hell&#8217;s Kitchen, and parts of Soho and Murray Hill. She also served as chairwoman of the council&#8217;s Health Committee, where she helped fight for important legislation &#8212; including the passage of the Equal Benefits Bill, which provides health care benefits to domestic partners and grocery workers. With an eye to developing her political career, Quinn also made sure to vary her interests. She served on the council&#8217;s committees for Finance, General Welfare, Governmental Operations, Land Use, Lower Manhattan Redevelopment, Rules, Privileges & Elections, as well as the Zoning & Franchises subcommittee. Quinn has said that before she went to work as Councilman Duane&#8217;s chief of staff, she often felt that elected officials&#8212;who get just one vote on issues&#8212;were less powerful than grassroots community organizers who can affect many legislative votes. After working in Duane&#8217;s office however, she had to reassess that view. &#8220;When you become chair of a committee, you see how when you move up the ladder you get more influence and impact than you would think from just the title,&#8221; she said at her inaugural press conference. &#8220;That swayed me in this direction.&#8221; Quinn also served as executive director of the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, and it was largely because of her involvement with that organization that then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani appointed her to become part of the New York City Police/Community Relations Task Force. The differences between Quinn and current Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg are significant&#8212;though perhaps less so than the rift between the mayor and former Council Speaker Gifford Miller&#8212;but both have pledged to work together for the improvement of the city and its quality of life. &#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with her on everything,&#8221; Mayor Bloomberg said in a press conference in Brooklyn shortly after Quinn&#8217;s election to speaker, &#8220;and I know she doesn&#8217;t agree with the administration on everything. But we&#8217;d be happy to work with whomever the City Council picks.&#8221; Perhaps the biggest issue Quinn and Bloomberg have locked horns over (or at least the one that the public is most aware of) was Quinn&#8217;s opposition to Bloomberg&#8217;s ultimately unsuccessful West Side Stadium plan. The mayor&#8217;s grand plan for the Hudson Rail Yards on the far West Side of Midtown Manhattan generated great controversy for the better part of a year&#8212;and was thought by many to be the linchpin in the city&#8217;s failed bid for the 2012 Olympic Games. From the start, Quinn&#8212;then representing the 3rd Council District, which included the Hudson Rail Yards and would have been home to the new football stadium complex&#8212;vigorously opposed the Bloomberg administration&#8217;s proposal. According to Quinn, the construction of a vast commercial stadium complex would have been done at the expense of the neighborhood&#8217;s housing stock (both affordable and market-rate), it&#8217;s open spaces, and its parkland. &#8220;It is a huge opportunity,&#8221; Quinn told New York magazine at the time. &#8220;And whatever we build, that&#8217;s it. We&#8217;re not going to do it again. I just don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s been the kind of process where anyone&#8217;s tried to determine what the city really needs. The planning was done after the goal had already been decided.&#8221; Since 1999, Quinn has been a leader on multiple fronts&#8212;she&#8217;s advocated for more comprehensive health care, equal rights for all New Yorkers, rational rezoning, better schools, and tenants&#8217; rights, and has spearheaded the move away from term limits for city council members. Currently, Quinn is exploring ways to compel the mayor to enforce the Dignity in All Schools Act, an anti-bullying measure for the city&#8217;s public schools. Both the benefits and the bullying measures were passed in 2004 over Bloomberg&#8217;s vetoes. Given her track record thus far, she may find success there as well. &#8220;She&#8217;s very effective and knows how to work well with people,&#8221; Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) told the Daily News. Nadler worked with Quinn to oppose the West Side stadium project. &#8220;She has a good rapport with different groups in the community.&#8221; Some of her other successes include helping to make New York City&#8217;s public spaces smoke-free, expanding access to emergency contraception to rape survivors and other New York City women, and increasing the availability of mammograms throughout the five boroughs. Quinn has mentioned on several occasions that her proudest accomplishment as a legislator has been with helping to save the Division of AIDS Services from elimination&#8212;as a separate, one-stop shopping agency for HIV-positive New Yorkers in need of city assistance&#8212;by Rudy Giuliani when he took office in 1994. Quinn helped organize thousands of people outside City Hall on the new mayor&#8217;s first full day on the job, a show of force that convinced the administration to back off its plan to do away with the division. Quinn has also been a vocal advocate for the improvement of public education, expanding computer labs in schools, renovating school playgrounds and buildings, rehabilitating libraries in her district, and expanding public schools&#8217; multicultural curriculum. &#8220;I very much support multicultural curriculum,&#8221; Quinn told representatives of the Empire State Pride Agenda (ESPA) during her most recent bid for re-election to her district council seat. &#8220;The schools in our diverse city have a responsibility to teach tolerance and respect for everyone.&#8221; The Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) is another program Quinn is proud to be associated with. &#8220;I support and would sponsor legislation that would strengthen the independence of the Civilian Complaint Review Board,&#8221; Quinn told ESPA representatives. &#8220;The city council should guarantee sufficient funding to attract qualified staff who are familiar with law enforcement practices and can conduct thorough investigations. The CCRB should be empowered to perform independent investigations and be given the power to subpoena witness and prosecute abuses&#8230;it&#8217;s much more important to have an independent disciplinary procedure set up which is outside the Police Department.&#8221; Providing an affordable place to live has also been one of Quinn&#8217;s biggest platforms. In her own district, she negotiated the rezoning of the Hudson Yards, ensuring thousands more units of affordable housing, lower density along the waterfront, and more responsible financing. &#8220;For too many New Yorkers, the city is simply not affordable,&#8221; said Quinn in her response to the city council&#8217;s budget for 2006. &#8220;Hardworking, taxpaying, middle-class families are being squeezed out. The unemployment rate in many communities&#8212;especially among African-American and Latino men&#8212;remains unacceptably high. And the least fortunate among us worry every day about getting the basic necessities&#8212;food, shelter, and health care.&#8221; &#8220;We can&#8212;and we must&#8212;make City Hall work even more effectively for our constituents. We can listen harder and make government smarter. We can expand programs that work and still demand accountability and results. We can end the dysfunctional budget practices of the past and begin real oversight of city finances. And most importantly, we can learn from government&#8217;s mistakes&#8212;and from tragedies&#8212;so that we do not repeat them.&#8221; Quinn&#8217;s approach to city government may be summed up by George Arzt, former press secretary for former Mayor Ed Koch and long-time friend of Quinn. Arzt told the New York Times in early 2006 that Quin.n &#8220;is a person who&#8217;s not afraid to stand up for what she believes in but she tries to sit down and reason with you. If not, she will go her own way.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, we can be proud of achievements,&#8221; says Quinn, &#8220;but we must not be satisfied.&#8221; Keith Loria is a freelance writer and frequent contributor to The Cooperator.

A-P correspondent Mike Gracia reports Wednesday's apparent suicide at Guantanamo Bay is raising new criticism of the prison. SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico &mdash; A Saudi Arabian detainee who apparently committed suicide at Guantanamo Bay had been held at the prison camp reserved for the least compliant and most "high-value" inmates, a U.S. military spokesman said Thursday. The Saudi government identified the man who died Wednesday as Abdul Rahman Maadha al-Amry. A spokesman for the kingdom's Interior Ministry, Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, said it was too early to judge how al-Amry died. The U.S. military has not confirmed the detainee's identity or explained how it arrived at the conclusion that he probably committed suicide. "The actual cause of death is under investigation," Southern Command spokesman Jose Ruiz said by telephone from Miami on Thursday. Ruiz said the man was held at the maximum-security Camp 5. Guards at the U.S. Naval Base in southeast Cuba found the detainee unresponsive and not breathing in his cell Wednesday afternoon, the Southern Command announced Wednesday. It would be the fourth suicide at Guantanamo since the prison camp opened in January 2002. On June 10, 2006, two Saudi detainees and one Yemeni hanged themselves with sheets. Prisoners in Camp 5, which is similar to the highest-security U.S. prisons, are kept in individual, solid-wall cells and allowed outside for only two hours a day of recreation in an enclosed area. Wells Dixon, a defense attorney who met with detainees at Camp 5 last month, said many showed signs of desperation. "I can assure you that it is hell on earth," Dixon said. "You can see the despair on the faces of detainees. It's transparent." Other critics said detainees are frustrated at being held indefinitely without charges. "You have five and a half years of desperation there with no legal way out," said Michael Ratner, president of the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents hundreds of Guantanamo detainees. "Sadly, it leads to people being so desperate they take their own lives." Lawyer Julia Tarver Mason, whose firm represents eight Saudi detainees at Guantanamo, said the government so far has declined to tell her if the man who died was among her clients. There are about 80 detainees from Saudi Arabia held at Guantanamo. "They are in the care of the United States government and that should mean that deaths should not occur," Mason said. The death came as Guantanamo prepares to hold pretrial hearings for two detainees in military tribunals. One of the detainees, Canadian Omar Khadr, fired his American attorneys on Wednesday, leaving him without defense counsel, his former U.S. military attorney told The Associated Press. Khadr is still to be arraigned Monday. He and Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni who also faces a hearing Monday, are among only three of the roughly 380 Guantanamo prisoners to be charged with a crime. The third, David Hicks, was convicted of aiding al-Qaida and returned to his native Australia. Khadr was 15 when he was captured in Afghanistan during a firefight in which he allegedly killed a U.S. Army special forces soldier with a grenade. "He doesn't trust American lawyers, and I don't particularly blame him," said U.S. Marine Lt. Col. Colby Vokey, who was taken off the case Wednesday. "The United States is responsible for his interrogation and his treatment under a process that is patently unfair." Many of the "enemy combatants" at the isolated prison camp have been held for more than five years. In most cases, the military accuses them of having links to al-Qaida or the Taliban. The former commander of the detention facilities, Navy Rear Adm. Harry Harris, described earlier suicides as acts of "asymmetric warfare" &mdash; an effort to increase condemnation of the prison. A cultural adviser was helping the military handle the remains. "The remains of the deceased detainee are being treated with the utmost respect," the military said. Associated Press writers Andrew O.

The days of racial politics returned with a fury at a heated City Council meeting yesterday, when Brooklyn Councilman Al Vann tried to restore the name of the late black activist Sonny Carson to an honorary street-renaming bill. The ensuing debate was punctuated by cheers and jeers from a gallery packed with supporters of Carson, who died in 2002. They remembered him as a man who shut down crack houses and helped found Medgar Evers College. Many in the Council, however, recalled Carson as an ex-convict, race-baiter and leader of boycotts against Korean groceries. Carsons name had been stripped from a bill of 51 other street designations in April, after Speaker Christine Quinn came out against it, describing the activist as a divisive figure known for his anti-white rhetoric. In submitting his amendment, Vann made the case that renaming four blocks of Gates Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant was not about honoring Carson but rather about respecting one communitys wishes. The proposed designation had come to the Council only after the community board overwhelmingly approved it. I dont want you to vote for Sonny Carson, Vann said. I want you to vote for the democratic principle. But true to Carsons vision, Vann could not overlook the legacy of race. I believe people of goodwill oftentimes make a lot of mistakes because they dont understand the people that theyre dealing with, Vann said, launching into a history lesson, with a detailed description of a slave ship and the consequences of Jim Crow. He spoke of the succession of less than human labels bestowed on blacks, from the n-word to Negro to minority. The constant thing for us, as black people, has been self-determination, he said. I know, a street renaming sounds so innocuous, so routine. And yet now its not that  youve hit a nerve. Youre harking back to a time weve already overcome. Councilman Charles Barron took the matter personally. Repeatedly refusing calls to sit down, he singled out black Councilwoman Leticia James for abstaining at an earlier vote and warned others with aspirations for citywide office not to show up at black churches. We are remembering this day, he said, turning on Quinn. You have divided us more than Sonny Carson ever divided any people. Councilman Bill de Blasio said he worked with Carson on the 1989 mayoral campaign of David Dinkins. He was a strong community leader, de Blasio said, though ultimately a negative one. A street renaming is done on behalf of all the people, he added. My conscience says that we should vote no. Councilman Oliver Koppell agreed, saying it would be wrong to honor someone who was a representative of achieving ends by threatening violence. Councilwoman Helen Foster accused Koppell of historical amnesia. Violence was defined by this country when they took Africans from their country, Foster said. I am the daughter of a man who saw his first lynching at 7 years old in Alabama. Quinn finally stood up to speak amid a shower of heckling. I believe the record is clear, she said. He was not an individual who sought to bring our city together. The Council shot down the amendment 25-15, with 7 abstentions.

It had tied the old record of 8.97 feet above sea level early on Wednesday before a day of sun evaporated more water from the lake. Officials said they will measure water depth again sometime Thursday morning and announce the new record low level for the largest lake in the southern United States and the second largest fresh water lake in the nation. It is also the back up drinking water source for the 5 million people in South Florida. The lake should be around 13 feet above sea level this time of year. Dried vegetation on the lake bottom fueled a 12,000-acre fire on the lake around northern rim on Monday that was 50 percent contained on Wednesday. The drought has caused more water restrictions for the 5 million people who call South Florida home. Lake Okeechobee serves as the primary back up reservoir for Miami and the rest of the area during summer droughts. However, with lake levels at historic lows, officials have tightened water restrictions on South Florida residents, businesses and farms. In addition, four well fields have been shut down in South Florida to prevent salt-water intrusion. For the year, the region has been well below normal for rainfall with only seven inches of rain so far. ''There's nothing coming back in," Randy Smith, spokesman for the South Florida Water Management District, told the Miami Herald Wednesday. "There's just no recharge whatsoever.'' Although it is only the end of May, officials say that they doubt that the lake will receive enough rain during the remainder of 2007 to bring the lake up to safe levels so that it can used as a back up reservoir for 2008 either. Officials say that it could take years of above average rainfall to bring lake levels back up again. Copyright © AHN Media Corp - All rights reserved.

Bush has nominated Robert Zoellick - a former government official with cosy ties to corporate America and extreme right-wing views - to take over as head of the controversy-stricken World Bank. Officials in Washington said that Bush expected the board of the bank to accept the nomination, thereby putting a damper on the scandal surrounding the organization's out-going president, Paul Wolfowitz. The U.S. -- which as the bank's biggest lender traditionally nominates its president -- is insistent that another American fill the top job despite calls from some countries -- especially in Europe -- to open the process to candidates from around the world. But while the Bush administration expressed confidence that Robert Zoellick will be accepted by the World Bank board, critics point out that Zoellick has had close ties to corporate America. He is the head of investment bank Goldman Sachs and previously served on the board of Enron, the world's largest oil company and also submerged in the mire of controversy. In government, Robert Zoellick served at the Treasury Department under President George H.W. Bush, Sr and under his son, he served as deputy Secretary of State and U.S. Trade Representative. Politically, Zoellick is closely aligned with the right-wing neo-conservatives. In 1998, he was a signatory to the mission statements of the Project for the New American Century, which called for increased military budgets and the ousting of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Several years later, he wrote an essay in Foreign Affairs magazine which imagined a U.S. foreign policy far more interventionist than initially imagined by Bush as he sought the presidency. He wrote: "A modern Republican foreign policy recognizes that there is still evil in the world, people who hate America and the ideas for which it stands" -- adding that the U.S. "must remain vigilant and have the strength to defeat its enemies."

Speaking at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Ga., Bush said Tuesday that arguments about the bill allowing illegal immigrants to remain in the country use the word "amnesty," which he said is not the case. "This bill is not an amnesty bill. If you want to scare the American people, what you say is, the bill is an amnesty bill. It's not an amnesty bill," Bush said. "For the skeptics who say that we are not concerned about border security or workplace enforcement, they need to read the bill." The bill says illegal immigrants who want to stay in the United States must apply for a new Z visa. To receive the visa, illegal workers must admit they violated the law, pay a fine, pass a strict background check, hold a job, maintain a clean record and learn English. A recent Senate amendment also stipulates illegal immigrants must pay back taxes as well. The measure also penalizes employers who knowingly employ illegal immigrants.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/nyregion/31parade.html&cid Judge Decides Against a Mayor Who Banned Cuban Parade - New York Times Judge Decides Against a Mayor Who Banned Cuban Parade Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: CITY, May 30 &#151; The parade must go on. A Superior Court judge ruled here on Wednesday that the Cuban Parade of could not be prohibited from going through West New York, despite the contention of its mayor that the event did not do enough to recognize the plight of the Cuban people. The decision, by Judge Maurice J. Gallipoli, came two weeks after Mayor Silverio A. Vega of West New York denied a permit to organizers of the eighth annual parade, casting into disarray a festival that sponsors said would attract 350,000 onlookers. After the hearing, the parade&#8217;s founder and chief executive, Emilio Del Valle, said, &#8220;Obviously, I&#8217;m pleased.&#8221; Mr. Vega, who emigrated from when he was 10, had threatened to physically block the parade, which is Sunday, if it tried to come through his town. But he modified that stance on Wednesday. &#8220;I respect the decision of the judge,&#8221; Mr. Vega said after the hearing, adding that although he was not encouraging people to block the parade, they &#8220;might be inclined&#8221; to do so. Mr. Vega&#8217;s lawyer, Daniel E. Horgan, said he was not sure whether his client would appeal. The decision sent organizers scurrying to rearrange the route yet again. The parade typically travels south from North Bergen through Guttenberg, West New York and Union City. But when Mr. Vega denied the permit, organizers decided to limit the parade to Union City, shortening the route by about a mile. After the decision, Mr. Del Valle said he was not sure whether the parade would go through Guttenberg or North Bergen, although Mr. Vega said that according to his reading of the judge&#8217;s orders, it must travel along its original route. Critics of Mr. Vega said that he blocked the parade because he did not want to be seen with Brian P. Stack, the mayor of neighboring Union City, with whom he is engaged in a heated Democratic primary campaign for State Senate. The election will be held two days after the parade. In court, Mr. Horgan contended that the town was right to deny the permit because the organizers were a &#8220;fraud.&#8221; He said the organization, the Latin American Kiwanis Club, had misrepresented itself as a nonprofit group on its application, while operating as a profit-making group. But Elise Di Nardo, a lawyer for Mr. Del Valle, said that the status of the group was irrelevant in denying the permit, and that the issue should be whether the parade posed any &#8220;governmental interest or governmental concern,&#8221; on issues like traffic or crowds. Several times in the hearing, an obviously annoyed Judge Gallipoli referred to the proceedings as &#8220;nonsense,&#8221; saying finally, &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to make sense of nonsense.&#8221; Next Article in New York Region (5 of 24) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

There were identified as 1st Lt. Keith Heidtman, 24, of Norwich, Conn., and Chief Warrant Officer Theodore Church, 32, of Ohio. The soldiers were flying an OH-58D Kiowa helicopter that crashed in Muqdadiyah after receiving heavy enemy fire during combat operations, the Defense Department said. They were part of the 2nd Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division based at Schofield. Six other soldiers died in a roadside-bomb ambush as they tried to rescue the two pilots, according to the Associated Press. The AP also reported today that Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believes the aircraft was brought down by small arms fire, and that the roadside bomb that killed a response team headed to the crash site was not the newer, armor piercing explosively formed penetrators, or EFPs, that have killed hundreds of U.S. soldiers. In high school Heidtman was an all-conference baseball player, a basketball player and an honor student, said his stepfather Arthur Robidoux. Robidoux, said his stepson joined the Army after graduating from University of Connecticut in 2005 with a bachelors degree in resource economics. After earning his wings Heidtman was assigned to the 25th Division in May 2006, and left for Iraq in December, Robidoux said. Robidoux told the Star-Bulletin that although he doesnt support the war Iraq, I support what he decided to do. Human life is a terrible thing to lose, especially the young people with a purpose in life, Robidoux said. Unfortunately they paid the ultimate price. I didnt agree with his choice (to join the military), but I do support him. Robidoux pointed out that 10 soldiers were killed or wounded on Memorial Day. My heart goes out to those affected soldiers  past and present. This isnt going to end any time soon. All these men and women are leaving behind young families. Heidtmans mother and father, Maureen Robidoux and Kerry Heidtman, and were notified of his death early yesterday morning. He also is survived by a sister, Keely Heidtman. The family, while devastated by the loss, is proud of his service to the country, said Arthur Robidoux. His perspective on life was pretty good. He had focus. He had drive. He did what he thought he could do best. He died for it. &copy; 2007 Honolulu Star-Bulletin --

He cast the debate as a struggle over America's soul and its reputation as a welcoming nation. "I'm deeply concerned about America losing its soul. Immigration has been the lifeblood of a lot of our country's history," the president said during an exclusive interview with McClatchy Newspapers on Air Force One. "I am worried that a backlash to newcomers would cause our country to lose its great capacity to assimilate newcomers." Bush underscored his commitment to the proposed overhaul -- despite harsh criticism from some conservatives -- as he traveled to Georgia for a speech that blasted the legislation's critics. "I'm sure you've heard some of the talk out there about people defining the bill. It's clear they hadn't read the bill. They're speculating about what the bill says, and they're trying to rile up people's emotions," he told an audience at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, near Brunswick. "If you want to kill the bill, if you don't want to do what's right for America, you can pick one little aspect out of it, you can use it to frighten people. Or you can show leadership and solve this problem once and for all." Conservative critics contend the proposal amounts to an amnesty program because illegal immigrants would be allowed to stay in the country after paying $1,000 fines. Some liberals complain that plans for a new temporary worker program are overly restrictive and would create a permanent underclass of foreign workers. Sitting in his spacious office on the presidential aircraft, Bush traced his commitment to immigration to his time in Texas. "When you grow up in Texas like I did, you recognize the decency and humanity of Hispanics. And the truth of the matter is, a lot of this immigration debate is driven as a result of Latinos being in our country," he said. "I have seen firsthand the beautiful stories of people being able to take advantage of opportunity and make solid contributions to our society." He said Americans have nothing to fear from large-scale immigration from Latin America. "There is an element of our society that is worried about two Americas," he said. "Our ability to welcome newcomers and the system's capacity to assimilate them has been one of the great powerful traditions of America. It works, and it will work this time." Bush expressed hope that the changes would reduce the need for a fence along the border with Mexico. The proposed fence has drawn protests in Texas, where officials fear it will hinder commerce and cause environmental problems.

(Photo: Doug Mills/The New York Times) Valerie Plame Wilson&#8217;s covert status at the C.I.A. is old news for many observers of the inquiry into the leaking of her identity. One side of the political divide argued that she was actually on desk duty at Langley at the time of Robert Novak&#8217;s infamous column naming her, which would mean that the leaking of her identity was, if not exactly nice, not illegal either. The other side, and Ms. Wilson herself, said the opposite. Patrick Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor, could have easily cleared up the confusion during his more than two years of prosecuting the case, but he waited until now. Ms. Wilson &#8220;was a covert employee,&#8221; Mr. Fitzgerald wrote, according to Newsweek . &#8220;The CIA was taking affirmative measures to conceal her intelligence relationship to the United States.&#8221; More While assigned to CPD, Ms. Wilson engaged in temporary duty (TDY) travel overseas on official business. She traveled at least seven times to more than ten countries. When traveling overseas, Ms. Wilson always traveled under a cover identity â sometimes in true name and sometimes in alias â but always using cover â whether official or non-official cover (NOC) â with no ostensible relationship to the CIA. Those statements emerged in a court filing concerning the pending sentencing of Lewis I. Libby, Vice President Cheney&#8217;s former chief of staff, who was convicted on five felony counts of obstruction of justice and perjury in the matter, but was not charged with violating the Intelligence Identities Act of 1982 So if Ms. Wilson was indeed covert, why wasn&#8217;t Mr. Libby, or anyone else who spread her name and affiliation around, charged with breaking that law? Kevin Drum at The Washington Monthly brings up another prerequisite under the law &#8220;The leakers had to know that leaking Plame&#8217;s name could be damaging, and Fitzgerald didn&#8217;t think he had the evidence to make that case,&#8221; he surmised. 84 comments so far... As Fitzgerald states in the sentencing documents, the reason he did not have the evidence to make the case was because Libby lied and muddied the waters. Fitzgerald was unable to determine if the Vice President was intentionally violating the Intelligence Identies Act because Libby lied about his role in the outing of Plame. Best Having tried a few murder cases, and been an in- telligence officer here and overseas, I&#8217;d like to weigh in on this. In fact, my question is a simple one: if this gal was &#8220;covert,&#8221; how is it that so many &#8220;spread her name and affiliation around?&#8221; Oh, well, maybe she was a little bit (pregnant)covert. BTW, that was a nice little (good-paying) gig for The Prosecutor. Nick Why didn&#8217;t someone tell her husband before he began spouting off to every news organ about his Niger follies. Easy- Patrick Fitzgerald is not the independent prosecutor he was portrayed to be. Hard to believe, but now it is obvious. He took down Libby in order to spare those who had obvious intent- Cheney, Rove, and probably W too. They left a written trail of intent, for crying out loud. Democrats are spineless wimps- there is more than enough evidence here to investigate and impeach those three, but that will never happen. There is no difference between a democrat and a republican. They are all Republicrats, and they are stealing our country. Vote Independent. There&#8217;s something else that always drives me nuts about the Bushie argument that revealing her identity casued no harm: it&#8217;s not like she was actually working undercover at the time she was &#8220;outted&#8221; after all&#8230; Outting her as an operative of any kind makes ALL the people overseas who had contact with her, whether they were the reason for her travels or not, vunerable to the accusation that they were working with the CIA, and therefore vunerable to retailiation for spying for the US. Doesn&#8217;t matter if they were working with her or not. How does a contact trust they can work with a CIA operative? How does anyone in a sensitive region trust working with any US citizen? Not the kind of thing that is going to help US operatives in the future and will certainly dampen enthusiasm for knowingly working with the CIA. That result is ironic and stupid when you consider the degree the Republicans decried the deteriation in person-to-person operations during the Clinton administration. I would not be surprised if this one bungle, committed for very limited and obtuse political gain, has done far more damage to personal covert operations then all the years of Clinton&#8217;s operational red tape and moral limits combined. Underfoot The sentencing will be a delight to watch and read about. All of the participants in this shameful episode will be back on the front page. The perfidy of Rove and crew back in the limelight. The public can only benefit from being reminded of the extreme lengths this group would go to defend lies about Iraq&#8217;s nuclear program. perrry If the leakers of Plame&#8217;s identity didn&#8217;t &#8220;know&#8221; that leaking her name would be damaging, then they are more stupid that I realized or they just didn&#8217;t care or both. What a tragedy! One should read the book written in the 1930&#8217;s which deals with America becoming a fascist dictatorship. Diamond The aim of the Iraq invasion was, according to the neocons, the installation of democracy in Iraq, from where it would spread into the rest of the region. One of the things fundamental to democracy is the availability of truth to the voting citizens. Valerie Plame (Wilson) was outed as punishment for her husband&#8217;s telling of the truth, and the action was quite clearly meant to be a demonstration of the consequences of telling truths wich which confounded the aims of the elected government. Why should others value your &#8220;democracy&#8221; if you obviously give it no value? may Loyal Bushies just continue to amaze me. They have argued indefatiguably for years that Valerie Plame wasn&#8217;t covert. Then she gave SWORN TESTIMONY that she WAS covert, and Loyal Bushies STILL questioned the FACTS. I will bet money that this article doesn&#8217;t change a thing for them; somehow Victoria Toensing and the rest of the Loyal Bushies will continue to somehow, someway believe that Valerie Plame was not covert. How do they know? Because a Loyal Bushie told &#8216;em so! âThe leakers had to know that leaking Plameâs name could be damaging, and Fitzgerald didnât think he had the evidence to make that case,â he surmised. Perhaps I&#8217;m a cynic but I find it interesting that Ms. Plame&#8217;s status at the CIA (covert or not) wasn&#8217;t a major focus of the investigation or given much attention even in press accounts until the publication of her memoir. Fitzgerald may not have had the evidence to make the case, but the intent of the leakers could not be more obvious. What, they did it &#8220;by acccident?&#8221; That&#8217;s a four year old kid&#8217;s excuse. Oh, wait, that&#8217;s just about exactly the level they operate on. Turner Travelling undercover does not, to me, mean covert assignment. All CIA employees likely travel that way both in US and to overseas destinations(vacations). Why? Because they could be squeezed for names, classified info, or any other bits that might later fill in a mosaic for the other side/s.My opinion isshe never was on a covert mission. Some people at CIA love to name drop and play the role just like some power hungry law enforcement officers. Drop in to Vienna, Va sometime. Schweitzer, Sr Of course Wilson was covert. It was CIA who requested the investigation into her blown cover in the first place. The real crime of libby is that by lying he has prevented those who actually broke the law in revealing her identity from being brought to justice. And probably in at least one individual&#8217;s case stopped his impeachment. It is amazing that the same folks who were frothing at the mouth about a fib concerning a consensual adult tryst are now making every excuse they can think of to justify sacrificing national security and potentially under cover operatives lives to scare a few political points. On deeper reflection it is not amazing at all, because the whole Lewinsky/starr affair was all about sacrificing the good of the nation to score a few cheap political points too. Walker In other words, it was like Fitzgerald stated at his press conference when he announced the Libby indictments: Libby&#8217;s lies threw sand in the face of the umpire so that no one could pin a thing on Cheney. Libby&#8217;s lies were so lame and transparent that it is hard to believe that a lawyer of his experience (it is entertaining to note that it was Libby who represented Mark Rich when he was pardoned by Clinton) would not know that his false statements would be uncovered almost immediately. Meanwhile the clock tick tocked away and Cheney is still firmly in power. Ted Wells called him a scapegoat&#8211;the truth is that it appears that he was a willing scapegoat. in Brooklyn President Bush will pardon Libby, as the Senate pardoned Clinton after his conviction (impeachment). And the world will &#8216;little note, nor long remember&#8217; Plame, Wilson, Fitzgerald, Scooter, Burger, Gonzales, di Grandpa Why is it that a simple person like myself, who has no real insight into the going-ons of the C.I.A., would, nevertheless, have the common sense not to give away the identity of one of my country&#8217;s secret service operatives? Robert Novak is far beyond me in his famed and privileged role as a Major Newspaper columnist. I suspect he would know, or should have known, even better than I, about not reporting the identity of Valarie Plame Wilson. Kelley Wilson should have shut up about &#8220;his Niger Follies&#8221;? Excuse me, but they weren&#8217;t &#8220;his follies&#8221;, the folly was dumya and his gang of neo cons who made up the story of the yellowcake in the first place. Sadly, Wilson speaking up wasn&#8217;t able to deter the runup to the war, but given the aftermath of this huge debacle (forever to be known as &#8220;dumyas war&#8221; in the history books, hopefully) the only folly was on the narrow minded, blind fools who perpetuated the myth, not Mr. Wilsons. And yeah, let&#8217;s all be loyal to our stupid in chief, let&#8217;s keep quiet when he commits gross acts of incompetency, etc&#8230;.gee, I am sure if they had bloggers back in the day people would have been sayying the same thing about Hitler and Stalin, too, that it doesn&#8217;t matter what he does, he is &#8220;our leader&#8221;. *phah*. It is ironic that we are fighting a war supposedly to bring democracy to Iraq, and we have supporters who decry the very thing democracy is supposed to be about, clear and transparent government answerable to the people. An impeachment isn&#8217;t a conviction, Al. The Senate didn&#8217;t &#8216;pardon&#8217; Clinton, it acquitted him. I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s wise for &#8220;covert&#8221; agents to meet with Washington Post reporters and attend Democratic events with their spouses at a time of self instigated controversy. We know the press well enough to know they will research every detail about a public figure. My question is why Armitage wasn&#8217;t assigned more blame. Plame is covert. If the Democrats were as nasty and hellish as the Republicans were in getting Clinton impeached over lying about a BJ, Plame&#8217;s outing could be made to stick and Fitzgerald could go after Cheney Rove etc. There is no will. The Plame outing is nasty warning to ordinary citizens by the bullies of this administration. Bushies have power and they will use it. We the people have been cowed including the media. We could pound the lies of Bush over and over and over until they are all censured and shamed. THE FACT that Ms. Wilson is working for the CIA don&#8217;t make any difference whether she is doing a desk job or not, the identity of an employee of the CIA must be ALWAYS protected from being publish because they maybe called upon to do a covert work later or done covert work in the past. Verdict: Send the VicePresident, Scooter Libby & Novak to jail. C&#8217;mon guys let get serious about this matter do the right thing. Anthony I find it truly mystifying that so long after this happened, this basic point of fact still remains in dispute in the minds of various right-wing crazies. It has been widely known since the outing that Plame was indeed undercover, the CIA stated so years ago. There has never, ever, been any evidence that she was not. There has only been the need on the part of those people who are for whatever strange reason, still loyal to the disgraced George Bush, to simply believe that she was not covert in order to minimize the nature of this crime and try to pretend it wasn&#8217;t actually a blatant betrayal of our country. In these fools&#8217; minds, it will never matter what the truth is. The truth is only what they want to believe. Clinton was not convicted and, of course, not pardoned either. Take a quick read of the constitution and you will figure it out. It is amazing to me after all this time that so many people are still willing to either give the administration credit for this issue or feign ignorance in order to protect it. Valerie Plame was a spy. Her husband, Robert Wilson, was a defense department analyst. He openly challenged the adminstration over the blatantly erroneous charge that Saddam Hussein had purchased &#8220;yellowcake&#8221; uranium from Niger. Then the administration, via Robert Novak, outed Ms. Plame to demonstrate what they were willing to do to ensure that their war in Iraq not be derailed. It is pretty simple really. This is the worst, most corrupt, and simultaneously most incompetent (except when it comes to filling coffers and protecting the guilty) administration in all of American history and they have gotten away with EVERYTHING! Oakland, California Republic. Dear Al di Grandpa, the Senate did not &#8220;pardon&#8221; Clinton. I guess the basics of how our government works elude you, but then maybe not. Right-wingnut ignorance is so often evidently willful, as some of the comments above make clear. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether *we* think Plame was &#8220;covert&#8221; or not, her employer, the CIA, says she was, and she was. Plame was working on nuclear proliferation issues, the very issue the Bushies whipped up into a froth to get their war, which has turned into a total disaster. (Quite a few intelligent people knew it would well before the fact, but that&#8217;s another issue.) It&#8217;s too bad that Fitzgerald wasn&#8217;t able to nail all of the creeps who committed what really is a treasonous act: Cheney, Rove, Armitage, Novak, all of them. But then the iron&#8217;s still in the fire for Rove, so the Congress and a Special Prosecutor may still get him on his crimes, either sooner or later. We&#8217;ll greatly note and long remember all the problems he caused. Prosecutors are asking 30 to 37 months in prison for Scooter Libby. Patrick Fitzgerald defends his request, saying that Libby &#8220;corrupted the judicial system&#8221; â yet there was no crime found to have been committed as a part of the so-called âoutingâ. [Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage is the person who âoutedâ her. Not Scooter Libby or Karl Rove.] I wonder if Valerie Plame will have her own troubles from Senator Bondâs ongoing investigation into her accounts of this event. Sheâs now apparently given three different versions of her own testimony &#8230; 1) She told told the CIA Inspector General that she suggested her husband for the trip; 2) She told the Senate committee staff she could not remember whether she suggested her husband or her boss did; 3) She told the House committee, emphatically, that she did not suggest him. I look forward to further results of the on-going Senate investigation into the veracity of this âinnocent and sadly-malignedâ CIA agent. It is just disgusting to see the depth putrid ness this government sunk to begin the deceitful Republican War in Iraq. Many respectable Americans, including Plame, reputations and work potential has been damaged or destroyed because of the Republican War in Iraq. As the future of the Republican War in Iraq continues to look bleak, we are also forced to endure incompetents like Alberto Gonzalez who squirms like a worm on a hook because of the damage he caused with his Stevie Wonder like destruction of American Jurisprudence. We laugh at the clown acts of Bushâs neo-con buddies like Condi and Cheney. We shrug off huge deficits, raging gas prices, the rich prospering while the middle class remains stagnant, milk $6 and change per gal etc in support of our Monarch. There is one thing that we can be sure of, Bush and his neo-con buddies will continue to fight the Republican War in Iraq against a ghost named terror at the cost of tens of billions of dollars without flinching. Bush, who I consider to be Neanderthalish, is smart enough to understand that a victory over terror is not possible because terror is a ghost. Bush also understands that a loss to terror is equally impossible for the same reason. We can also be sure that a gullible conservative American society will follow this black sheep government over the steepest cliff without flinching. IMPEACH THE REPUBLICAN WAR IN IRAQ. Tesstimony at the Waxman/Reid committee by admittedly Republican ex-CIA agents confirmed her activities overseas using private passport esposing her to unprotected treatment by foreign governments. Outing closed down a CIA front in Beirut marking everyone who went in or out. This partial list of consequences reveals &#8220;aid and comfort to the enemy&#8221; comonly known as High Treason. BRING A ROPE! F. Dever Mr. Nizza inaccurately writes, &#8220;Fitzgerald&#8230; could have easily cleared up the confusion during his more than two years of prosecuting the case&#8230;&#8221; In fact, when Fitzgerald announced the indictment on 10/28/05, he specifically stated that Agent Plame&#8217;s true identity was classified and that her cover was blown by Robert Novak&#8217;s column. These facts also were included in the official indictment itself. There was never any &#8220;confusion&#8221; about Agent Plame&#8217;s covert status, just Republican disinformation spread by right-wing Republican political operatives. It&#8217;s a shame &#8211;but no surprise&#8211; how easily The Right sides with the terrorists and attacks those who defend America when their political misdeeds get exposed. Rionero This is interesting word play with &#8220;covert.&#8221; All you need to know is she drove every day to the CIA headquarters in her family car right through the front gate. Any intelligence agency in the world knows the license plates numbers of the people who work at CIA (or should if they own cameras). Oh, and the secret spy name she used, Valerie Plame? That was her maiden name. The maiden name that her husband listed in his entry of his spouse in Who&#8217;s Who in Washington. So, Joe W publishes his fantasy tale of mint tea in Niger. Intelligence agencies around the world look him up and see he was married to Valirie Plame. It does not take too long to connect the dots. Maybe people should be more concerned about Sandy Berger stealing and destroying classified docs that were supposed to go the 9/11 commission. AG Is that the same attorney who helped defend the so called blind shiek? His name was Fitzgerald if I remember correctly. spencer The reason Plame&#8217;s name was released is because Wilson lied to the press and asserted that the Vice President&#8217;s office had recommended him for the Niger fact-finding mission. This was a lie. The Vice President&#8217;s office was simply stating the facts: Wilson&#8217;s wife had recommended him. Much ado about nothing. Scooter was railroaded. OK, fine, Libby lied. Why does that bring the process full stop? Doesn&#8217;t the system often cope with lying witnesses? Aren&#8217;t there ways to still go after the perps? keyes I don&#8217;t understnd why Novack and his publisher were not persued for actually publishing this story. Can someone tell me please? korda I hear the loud sound of Bushies slapping each other on the back for a job well done. c Although this should settle the matter once and for all, it has long been settled as an inferential matter. Why? Because there would have been no basis &#8212; none &#8212; for an investigation and the appointment of a special counsel, had Plame not been established to the Justice Department&#8217;s satisfaction that Plame was covert in the first place. Otherwise, there would have been no potential violation of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act to investigate. To believe otherwise, one must ascribe nefarious motives to *both* the notoriously independent and professional Patrick Fitzgerald, and the man who appointed him, the equally independent and professional James Comey. How the news media consistently failed to make this simple, inescapable inference and report it escapes me. But they are guilty of it again and again and again. For years we have been hearing from certain pundits and editorial pages that Plame was not covert. And for years anyone in possession of a few facts and a few brain cells to rub together have known better, or should have. I can&#8217;t believe those on this board defending her outing by suggesting that she was only partly covert. Even if she was partly covert, that is enough and it is ATROCIOUS that she was outed for polical purposes in what turns out to be a PREEMPTIVE WAR under false (i.e. LIES) pretenses. Old Nick #2 is not a patriot no matter what he thinks. And if Old Nick really is an &#8220;intelligence&#8221; officer here and overseas, God help us. That explains why we are so ignorant as to the goings on abroad and are more at risk than ever before. Also, Fitzgerald&#8217;s credibility is sound. Who do you believe, Fitzgerald or Bush, Cheney and Rove? Valerie Plame may have been technically &#8220;covert,&#8221; but the idea that exposing her identity could have resulted in any significant harm to U.S. intelligence activities is risible. Covert intelligence has never been the U.S.&#8217;s long suit, but given the recent deterioration in the CIA&#8217;s covert capabilities and tradecraft as a result of periodic Congressional purges, it is almost certain that her covers were so thin as to be almost transparent. It would be amazing if Ms. Plame&#8217;s identity wasn&#8217;t known to the intelligence organs of every country in which she set foot the moment she cleared passport control. Seal To S.B. Poster #4- &#8220;Vote Independent&#8221;? Are you kidding? Maybe it&#8217;s just the part of the country I live in, but every &#8220;Independent&#8221; that runs for office is a Republican trying to hide. A politician who calls him/herself &#8220;independent&#8221; is like one who calls him/herself a &#8220;moderate&#8221;. If you have to say it, it ain&#8217;t so. It was the beginning of America realizing the Republican party could not be trusted and would harm the country for their own advantage. Folks - pull up to 25,000 feet here&#8230; if you&#8217;re defending Bush, claiming Wilson wasn&#8217;t covert, and generally saying it&#8217;s OK to out her whether covert or not, then you&#8217;re defending lying, dirty tricks, doing end runs around the constitution, the law and the people of the US. So, why not just admit you believe in the end justifies the means and that you have no respect for our democracy or for our laws? Then again, I can&#8217;t say I blame you when this country cares more about American Idol than all of our soldiers serving our country. in SD It&#8217;s amusing to see how some are still in denial, still trying to pass blame, still coming up with lame remarks in defense of the stupid and dangerous disclosures that resulted in the exposure of one of our country&#8217;s covert CIA officers. They&#8217;ve demonstrated where their loyalties lie &#8212; with the GOP, not with truth our nation or it&#8217;s security. Geriatrics, who have perhaps never served at the end of the whip in either the intel /military communities, may not remember anything of importance to those who did. Those of us, who did serve in positions at the expense of our personal lives, will never forget how the Clinton clowns thoroughly succeeded in paving the way for disasters like WTC I /II (911 to you grampa) by emasculating the mil/intel communities and appointing PC nimrods with whom they never met privately anyway. As you have computer access, suggest you do some homework; and if you use the BR, remember to clean up after yourself. Flotsam The order of events tells the real story. 1) Armitage disclosed his identity as the leaker to Colin Powell immediately when it came out. 2) The CIA determined early on that there would be no prosecution as the trial would do more harm to national security than the leak itself. 3) They then referred the matter to the FBI. 4) That being the case, the investigation by the FBI was for what purpose? Apparently, the only real purpose here was to distract from Plame&#8217;s own misconduct in recommending her husband for the trip to Niger. Under the now defunct special prosecutor law, the special prosecutor is obligated to follow the US Attorney&#8217;s guidelines for prosecution. Fiztgerald must have known in advance there wouild be no prosecution of the underlying charge, making the taking of testimony from Libby a perjury trap, a violation of the guidelines. Zingher, esq They all knew she was covert whether Fitzgerald was able to prove it or not. It was just a matter of politics to smear a critic who exposed their lies, and the best form of revenge was to go after his wife even if she was a covert CIA agent. Are they in any sense believable after their lies are being exposed every day.You have to expect something dastardly from this bunch. Lest one forgets that perpetual war was the Rovian strategy to keep a Republican lock on the White House and Congress and this type of thinking is what got us into this mess in Iraq. If the war in Iraq is so central to keep the terrorists away from harming this country how come none of their kids are volunteering to serve this country in Iraq. Libby was just the sacrificial lamb and will get pardoned by Bush. Ramanand Gee &#8212; Nobody has told me what she was doing so I don&#8217;t think she was doing anything covert. Please rejoin the reality-based community. Who do you think would tell you what covert things she was doing? She testified she was covert and the CIA backed her up from the beginnning. Her husband in an act of pure patriotism corrected a lie told by the President of the United States. (Well, a weasel lie, he said the British think &#8212; neve mind that we know better and that the CIA took the line out several times before missing it in the last go round on the speech.) Wilson thought the &#8216;publican party office holders would have enough ethics not to put Valerie&#8217;s contacts at risk no matter how angry they were with him for exposing the Bush&#8217;s dishonesty. So far anyone who has trusted them has been wrong. In the five years before Valerie Plame&#8217;s alleged &#8220;outing,&#8221; she married Joe Wilson, was pregnant with twins, had postpartum depression for an unspecified period of time &#8212; all mentioned in Joe Wilson&#8217;s book. Since she was on maternity leave for at least 15 months and who knows how long on sick leave for the postpartum depression and probably pressed for time raising twins and recovering from her depression, which can take years, exactly when did she have time to be covert? While the media knew these facts during the timeframe of the Niger trip and Bob Novak&#8217;s column, how often have they reported the facts of her pregnancy and illness. Gives another perspective to the story, doesn&#8217;t it? Yup, everybody will come out just fine. Plame gets some book deal and her washed-up, has-been &#8220;Ambassador&#8221; hubby got his 15 minutes worth in this paper. Together their apex was the fab Vanity Fair piece. Old Republican workhorse Libby gets a pardon. It&#8217;s the perfect Hollywood ending. The problem for all of us is that&#8217;s all the Dems seem to be capable of these days&#8230;Hollywood endings. NY I&#8217;m astonished at the number of ridiculous arguments made here. Old Nick sniggers at the money Fitzgerald must have made, a charge I doubt he made about Ken Starr&#8217;s five year fishing expedition that ended with a charge of perjury. To suggest that Fitzgerald was disingenuous has no basis. He was assigned to look into the Plame leak and he did just that. To question his motives, considering he was reportedly a Republican, also has no basis. Then we have Dan who says it was Joe Wilson&#8217;s fault she was outted because he went to Niger. Then SB says Fitzgerald&#8217;s protecting Cheney et al, which, if he&#8217;d read Fitzgerald&#8217;s sentencing report pointing at those same people, he&#8217;d understand differently. There are conspiracies aplenty in this Administration, the most impeachable in our history, but you&#8217;ve got to back them up no matter what side you&#8217;re on. Doze With the smell of war profits in the air, no price was too large to get the war machine kicked into motion. SO what if treason is committed and the american people are lied to and their rights trampled. What are the lives of a few career spooks, tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of iraqies, thousands of dead and injured american solidiers, sailors and marines, when there is easy american tax-payer money to be made/stolen and an empire to be built. Riddle me this&#8230;who forged the Niger Yellow Cake Memorandum? You know, the one referenced by those &#8220;sixteen words&#8221;, the one that Joe Wilson&#8217;s trip revealed to be a fake, the one which implicity led Valerie Wilson to be outed. Who has the capability to create a forgery that could fool the U.S., even for a short period of time? Who had the motivation to fabricate an piece of intelligence, and the means to place it &#8220;upstream&#8221; so that it could float down at the right time to justify this bogus war? Why is no one asking? Hamaway Clinton was not &#8220;convicted.&#8221; To be &#8220;convicted&#8221; the Senate would have had to vote for that status. He was &#8220;indicted.&#8221; Why use language if you don&#8217;t really care what it actually means? This is more than any other reason why this country and culture is headed down the tubes. And ol Al di Grandpa thinks he&#8217;s so smart and cynical and knows what&#8217;ll happen. People are so deliberately untruthful to themselves. Osburn Fitzgerald knew the source of the leak to Novak was Richard Armitage before the grand jury even started taking testimony. The investigation should have ended there. Everything done after was just a witch hunt. This administration violates the Espionage Act of 1917. High crimes and misdemeanors. Impeachable offence. It seems this administration is keen on hiring Alzheimer patients who can&#8217;t remember anything and bad lawyers who can&#8217;t read statutes. GHW Bush: Spy name leakers &#8220;most insidious of traitors.&#8221; If anybody thinks that Libby even POOPED without Cheney&#8217;s express permission, they&#8217;re completely out of their gourd. Now it&#8217;s time for Cheney to be impeached, censured, and jailed for TREASON. If not for this, then for selling Iran the centrifuges they are processing uranium with now. While Cheney was still CEO of Halliburton, and up until 2005 when they got caught, the company was engaged in backdoor deals through Dubai with Iran, in violation of U.S. sanctions that had been in place since 1995. How about Rove - is he on the plane to Gitmo yet? Novak,Armitage, Card, Scooter and Rove, Chimpy and Shooter, need to be charged with treason. This was a high crime and we should see if some waterboarding might make them reveal bush as the chief Treasonist All the unhinged koolaid drinkers reich-wingers are still in denial of facts and the truth.. the spin: since no one was tried for treason, then that&#8217;s the &#8220;proof&#8221; that she wasn&#8217;t covert. Good old circular logic forever: no one brought her case to trial because she wasn&#8217;t covert. The proof that she wasn&#8217;t covert is the fact that a treason case wasn&#8217;t brought to trial. I am amazed that we continue to accept the convoluted logic of the Bush administration that tells lies and that demonizes anyone who refuses to believe them. Halliburton&#8217;s no bid contract Why is this administration still in office? Because those who should stand up and unmask the lies refuse to do so. Loyal and brave Americans are dying and being and being maimed while our nation looses credability in the rest of the world because thay see through the litany of lies. The greatest of which is that America needed to attack IRAQ for 9/11. It was Saudi Arabia that attacked America on 9/11, from there the slippery slope became a rollercoaster ride into our present quagmire. Bush, Chaney and their minions are so busy following up on their lies that they have little time for the truth or the real business of the American people. She wasn&#8217;t covert. You can&#8217;t believe her regarding her status, read today&#8217;s paper. They want to bring her back before congress to explain her three versions of who sent Joey to Niger. Why are we asking all of these people about her status - she worked for the CIA, they have records. There must be a paper giving her status at that time. Since it has not appeared and the Dems are in charge we must conclude that the paper states she was not covert. There was no intent. When the Novak story appeared it was clear that the White House was saying &#8221; how serious was this trip - his mommy sent him to Niger&#8221;. Wilson and Plame are lame (sorry). That is why they have moved far away. They have their money and now they want everything to fade away before they face any real scrutiny. Redner Doesn&#8217;t anyone remember that great Neo-con, Iraq War Supporter and supreme Bushista, Richard Armitage who has admitted leaking Palme&#8217;s name to Novak? He would do anything to further the wicked Cheney&#8217;s evil agenda. Give me a break. If Bush has a sense of humor he&#8217;ll pardon Libby, Sandy Berger and Bill Clinton at the same time. She was covert. She was covert. She was covert. There it is three more times for the deniers. They can now move on to foist another lie on the American people. Mosley What I find interesting is that the actual leaker was known to Fitzgerald almost from the beginning of the investigation and no charges were ever brought against him. This whole thing was stupid and funny, we should make it a comedy and make it a hit in Hollywood. I am speechless, what hope are there if we have these people working in our government to &#8216;lead&#8217; us, we all going down the cliff. Wu What I find interesting about this case is that the actual leaker was known to Fitzgerald almost from the beginning. Even before Libby made his mess. Charges were never even filed against him. Mrs. Wilson was covert, undoubtedly. Someone blew her cover during a time of war, which is treason. The traditional penalty of hanging must be applied to the guilty party. I don&#8217;t expect that that will happen until after 1/20/09 when democracy is restored, but it must happen eventually. Treason cannot be taken lightly. Stackhouse Amazing not one mention of the 9/11 commission&#8217;s findings on Joe Wilson&#8230; &#8220;The 9/11 report casts significant doubt over ALL of Wilson&#8217;s &#8220;findings&#8221; in Niger.&#8221; &#8220;Wilson admitted to the 9-11 Committee that he may have exaggerated. The 9-11 Committee found conclusively that Iraq was attempting to procure enriched (yellowcake) uranium in Africa.&#8221; But hey who cares about the truth here? Contributor Osborne (above) laments that &#8220;People are so deliberately untruthful to themselves.&#8221; More correctly, many people are intellectually dishonest and freely expose themselves to a disappointed public while hiding behind the anonymity of a user name. Such hidden &#8220;contributors&#8221; cannot be bested in argument and they cannot lose in debate, so there&#8217;s no point in trying to refute their nonsensical statements. My take? There was no valid reason for anyone in the administration to reveal the nature of Mrs. Wilson&#8217;s employment. Whose business is that? If folks were unhappy with his report from Niger, then they should have contested the report itself and not attacked Wilson or his wife. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t like the message, then kill the messenger&#8221; continues to be the administration&#8217;s principal rule of engagement. Lowenthal # 48. May 30th, 2007 Gives another perspective to the story, doesnât it? Kool-aid perspective. More Kool-aid to you ! And, how about: get a life ? Your own life. So you can worry about your own postpartum. CIA requested the inquiry of identity leak of CIA&#8217;s covert agent Valerie Plame Wilson. Numerous CIA agents worldwide were exposed since they were all using the same FAKE company name. And, their many contacts in many countries were outed as well, finished, ALL in one stroke. We were never told how many made safe trip home (or, not), or, how many of the non-US citizens/ CIA foreign informants were killed/ imprisoned, ceased to cooperate, etc. The rules of determination of agent status are quite elaborate and clear. Like dealing with IRS rules. Either the test is met, or not. Despite derenged and ancient Victoria Toensing&#8217;s Addams Family Anniversary Special for the Congress. Case closed. If this were a sane world, those responsible for &#8220;Outing&#8221; Valerie Plame would be waiting on execution for treason; the ignorant Fox news zombies still screaming &#8220;She&#8217;s not covert&#8221;, would be placed on an &#8220;ark&#8221; and shipped off to Iran to join other lunnietoon religeous fanatics; and Robert Novak would have been at least fired - never to be hired again as a journalist. But we don&#8217;t live in a sane world do we? No, we live in the bubble of nazi leaning fascist crazyness: Controlled by wealthy oil Bush regime sponsers who laughingly state &#8220;reality&#8221; for Americans is what THEY determine it to be, America&#8217;s daily media news flash must either be approved by America&#8217;s propaganda minister, Karl Rove - or censored. God help us&#8230; Staged Bush theatrics to foster phony patriatism? High government officials committing treason? Rigged elections? A media lieing to you in the face of fact WHILE DARING YOU TO SAY OTHERWISE? Is this the America our forefathers fought for? Is the only way left for Americans to get our constitution / country back, to be armed insurection? Load your weapons&#8230; Ready yourself. For the time is fast approaching. And this time, the revolution for democracy&#8217;s return will be led by veterans (as recent polls indicate). Tucker MARCH 7, 2003 â The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) â the international body that monitors nuclear proliferation â tells the UN Security Council that, after a âthorough analysisâ with âconcurrence of outside experts,â that the Italian documentsâ âwhich formed the basis for the reports of recent uranium transactions between Iraq and Nigerâare in fact NOT AUTHENTIC.â MARCH 19, 2003 â President Bush announces the START OF IRAQ WAR in a televised address, saying it is âto disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger.â AUGUST 21, 2006-âThe main reason we went into Iraq, at the time, was WE THOUGHT HE HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. It TURNS OUT HE DIDN&#8217;T&#8221; Bush N if only more people would have these kinds of discussions and more politicians would listen to them. let&#8217;s move these discussions into a more public sphere where politicians can hear and respond. what kind of democracy is the us anyway? for all bush & co claim to love democracy, all they really care about is lining their pockets and those of their cronies, such as the oil companies. that&#8217;s what the war was about in the first place and the longer bush & co are allowed to get away with their blantant lies and illegal activities, the further they will undermine what they profess to love&#8211;democracy. #31: &#8220;Maybe people should be more concerned about Sandy Berger stealing and destroying classified docs that were supposed to go the 9/11 commission. AG&#8221; You are misinformed. He stole copies: But then you don&#8217;t care about facts. #48 Liz. No, it doesn&#8217;t mean a thing. Operatives in CIA don&#8217;t always have to be on duty. You are a Republican party apparatchik or so it sounds. Keep up the good work. It&#8217;s possible that you may yet ensure that the Republicans lose even more seats in the Senate, not just the Presidency. #57 Bill Redner. You are mistaken. The CIA asked for the investigation. I thought you conservatives believe in the rule of law? Or is it only sometimes? #64 pig: That&#8217;s a mischaraterization and you know it. traverse, by your logic, the NYT is certainly guilty of treason. Afterall, it exposed the entire CIA network used to fly terrorists to their new homes. Bottom line is that Wilson put his lies out there (as confirmed by the Senate) to make a bogus case. Plame drove herself to the office daily, traveled under her own name, hadn&#8217;t been living overseas in five years, got her husband an official assignment, whose results he not only lied about, but also leaked to major newspapers and then wrote his own lying editorial about it - and then she claimed she didn&#8217;t get him the job. Riiggghhhttt. Of course, she was so covert that she was listed in Who&#8217;s Who, but why let facts get in the way of the lefties personal truth&#8217;s? Sense I get so tired of listening to Bush haters spew ignorance about the infamous yellow cake. Niger was accused of agreeing to sell 500 tons of yellow cake to Iraq. Wilson claimed this wasn&#8217;t true bacause he flew down to Niger and asked the very people that stood to gain from the sale if they had done so. They said it wasn&#8217;t true. That is all he had in the way of evidence when he accused Bush of lying when he reported the sale base on British intel. What those that are quick to bash Bush obviously fail to remember, is the Yellow cake that was found at the nuclear research center of AlâTuwaitha in Iraq when American tanks rolled into Bagdhad during the first Gulf War. Care to guess how much was found? 500 tons!!! HMMM&#8230;where have we heard that figure before? Anyone want to guess where that 500 tons of yellow cake came from? Don&#8217;t ask Wilson as he obviously doesn&#8217;t have a clue!!!! You do know that in the OK, so I got it wrong vis-Ã -vis Clinton and the Constitution. Wasn&#8217;t the issue with him about lying under oath? Much the same as Libby, no? By the way, to all who corrected me, thank you. The vitriol wasn&#8217;t necessary. Or was it? di Grandpa The Wilson bashing would amaze me, if I wasn&#8217;t now used to seeing people who serve the USA get smeared by the right. Wilson spent over 10 years doing grunt work in africa and was #2 in our embassy iraq before GW1, where he became famous for facing down saddam and was called &#8216;a true american hero&#8217; by GHWB. It seems to me that if anyone said &#8216;get me an expert on both africa and iraq&#8217;, Wilson would be right at the top. However all we hear is &#8216;his wife sent him&#8217; and other smears. Wilson was perfectly qualified to find out about the yellowcake. AFAIK, all niger&#8217;s uranium was contracted to a french company, so it was not difficult to find if they had diverted 500 tons. The argument that Plame was not covert are ridiculous. I have no doubt of how the peoply saying that would react if a democrat had made a similar leak&#8230;.gitmo here we come. Now anyone who was associated with &#8216;brewster and jennings&#8217; is blown too, and people associated with them. keyes Plame was covert. What was done is treason. If a Democrat had done it, Republicans would be asking for the death penalty. There is no doubt. As reported regarding Valerie Plame&#8217;s covert employer: &#8220;Compounding the damage, the front company, Brewster-Jennings & Associates, the name of which has been reported previously, apparently also was used by other CIA officers whose work now could be at risk, according to Vince Cannistraro, former CIA chief of counterterrorism operations and analysis. Now, Plame&#8217;s career as a covert operations officer in the CIA&#8217;s Directorate of Operations is over. Those she dealt with &#8212; on business or not &#8212; may be in danger. The directorate is conducting an extensive damage assessment. And Plame&#8217;s exposure may make it harder for American spies to persuade foreigners to share important secrets with them, U.S. intelligence officials said.&#8221; Warren Strobel, &#8220;Leak of CIA Officers Leaves Trail of Damage&#8221;, Knight Ridder (Washington, D.C.), October 11, 2003, rpt. in Common Dreams NewsCenter, October 11, 2003. 71.

That certainly makes us more welcome and competitive in the world economy. I did travel to/did work in almost 50 countries, I know very well what is involved. I am also multilingual, operating in nearly 10 languages, so I usually get it from the original sources, withour the filter by Rovian Ministry of Truth you obviously rely on. You are one of the prime examples that anti-American parochial ignorance and arrogance of some least qualified Americans is well and alive. Common Sense - call yourself whatever self-congratulatory in the Week of Charity for Animals. You can confirm it&#8217;s allowed with Bill Falafel/Rush Limpdick, or the Faux news. If in doubt, mAnn Coulter or another reich-wingnut could help you to adjust. You can start baking cookies for Scooter&#8217;s prison packages - he&#8217;ll have lots of fun in prison w/ a name like that. Cookies can only add to his universal appeal, so get going. Should nothing else work, pull your head out, &#8220;common sense&#8221;, you are clearly suffering from oxygen starvation. This condition does not exempt you from service in Iraq, so get ready ! &#8220;Under the statutory definition, a &#8220;covert agent&#8221; under 50 U.S.C. 426(4)(A) includes someone: * Who is an employee of an intelligence agency, * Whose identity as an employee of the intelligence agency is classified, and * &#8220;Who is serving outside the United States or has with the last five years served outside the United States&#8221; An alternate definition of &#8220;covert agent&#8221; under 50 U.S.C. 426(4)(B) specifies someone who &#8220;resides and acts outside the United States.&#8221; You &#8220;reside&#8221; in the country where you have a permanent assignment, but you can &#8220;serve&#8221; the agency outside the United States in the manner described by Plame&#8217;s former C.I.A. colleague, Larry Johnson: &#8220;I can tell by virtue of how that [CIA from] company was set up. She was traveling overseas as a consultant in order to meet individuals who would have access, could be either agents of access, could be possible recruits to become spies for the United States in the area of about chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.&#8221; Testimony before the Senate Democratic Policy Committee on July 22, 2005 [PDF] In fact &#8220;serving outside the United States&#8221; can mean something very temporary. A grunt who spent two months in Tikrit &#8220;served&#8221; in Iraq. Condoleezza Rice travels to the Middle East in the service of the United States. If Plame traveled outside the U.S. for C.I.A business during the past five years, she was a &#8220;covert agent.&#8221; Case closed ! Keep in mind that many of the same people who refuse to believe that anyone in the Whitehouse would knowingly give up a CIA agent, also believe that the world was created in 6 days about 6000years ago. This in spite of overwhelming evidence that the earth is about a million times older than that. To many of these people logic and truth are just tools to be manipulated to suit an agenda. How they arive at their agenda I do not pretend to understand, but truth has nothing to do with it. I am not going to point fingers or call names. However, I deal in facts, not speculation or propaganda. I would like to see documents proving the following assertions (or at least news articles mentioning them, not blogs or opinion pieces): 1) Valerie Plame made three different assertions concerning who suggested her husband&#8217;s trip to Niger. I&#8217;ve been following this case from the beginning, and I&#8217;ve never heard that. 2) The 9/11 Commission Report cast significant doubts over all of Joe Wilson&#8217;s findings. Again, first time I&#8217;ve heard that. 3) 500 tons of yellow cake uranium were found in Iraq. I&#8217;m SURE I would have remembered that one if I had heard it before! To those who substitute vitriol for arguments, there is such a thing as &#8220;reasonable men may dif- fer,&#8221; so let us engage in and enjoy civil discourse Nick Hey Laura&#8230;try these facts #1 Valerie Plame testified at the Libby trial and again before congress that she had absolutely nothing to do with sending her husband to Niger. YETâ¦ According to page 39 of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report on pre-war intelligence, July 2004, Wilson âwas selected for the 1999 trip after his wife mentioned to her supervisors that her husband was planning a business trip to Niger in the near future and might be willing to use his contacts in the region.â Or the declassified Carl Ford Jr. memo, (page 6) where it states&#8230;that Valerie actually convened the CIA meeting in which she discussed sending Joe to Niger. Both are a matter of record. Since you have followed this from the beginning I am not sure how you missed all this&#8230;maybe your source of news? Anyhow&#8230;there were multiple testimony by others during the Libby trial, including peers/coworkers that point to her testimony as being a lieâ¦and/or not the same as to what she had previously claimed or conflicted with what they personally knew as fact. #2 It wasnât the 9/11 report it was in the same intelligence report as above&#8230;page 73&#8230;it said for most analysts Wilsonâs trip to Niger âdidnât change any analystsâ assessments of the Iraq-Niger uranium dealâ and that his report âlent more credibility to the original CIA reports on the uranium dealâ. 3# I assume that was directed at my post.Google is a wonderful thing&#8230;try it &#8230;google &#8220;al Tuwaitha Iraq&#8221; under news&#8230;once again a matter of record. You donât remember Hans Blix ranting that looting of the facility presented a concern and that as occupiers we are responsible. I am surprised you were unaware of this as even the NYTâs carried the story, although their purpose in doing so was to try and minimize the repercussions of such a find&#8230;claiming it was of no real consequence. I just wish if you liberals are going to demand these senate investigations..the least you could do is read them. Hey Nick! Well said. Do I know you? Correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that the left, liberal, Democrats, et. al. seem very angry and their comments often get ugly. Very counter-productive in my view. di Grandpa hey dan&#8230;try this fact. joe wilson was probably the best qualified person available to investigate a matter involving iraq and africa (and &#8216;a true american hero&#8217; according to GHWB) you look for dodgy motives to give someone a job when they&#8217;re not qualified, not when they&#8217;re the best&#8230;.unless the real aim is a smear. and, smearing is one thing the bush admin is competent at. case closed. keyes The (2 tons or so of) yellowcake (the rest of the 500 tons was natural Uranium) at Tuwaitha wasn&#8217;t in question here, we knew about that, which is why it was already under seal by the IAEA. The only scandal there is that the facility itself wasn&#8217;t secured, and *after* we went to war against Iraq, the seal was broken and it was looted by the native Iraqis. Now, almost all of the Uranium was found and recovered, although some of the Iraqis had dumped out the (useless, to them) Uranium and were using the barrels to store water (and subsequently got radiation sickness). But if you were worried about terrorists obtaining nuclear materials, then it seems you should have been more worried about us going to war in Iraq than about us not going to war in Iraq&#8211;at least before the war, the IAEA had a handle on things, but after the war, Iraq became one huge ammo dump free-for-all; good job there, buddy. With some four score entries on this blog regard- ing La Plame and her hubby, I suspect the truth lurks somewhere within. If only we could get some dispassionate mediator to plow through it all, ex- cise the name-calling and determine the facts! Of course, other factors are at play, like who will win the presidency and the congress in the next couple of years. Who will admit he was wrong? And so, Ol Al (would that be Del Nonno in Italian?) at least we can be said to try to keep the dis- course civil, regardless of the equities.

"Today Show" co-host Matt Lauer spoke with Romney. And, of course religion was the topic of conversation. Lauer: You started your morning and you were at an event and a guy you were walking up to shake his hand. Basically said and I am paraphrasing here 'I'm one of these people who is not going to vote for a Mormon for president.' Are you worried that it is still an issue in 2007? Romney: Not really. I really don't think it is. I know that there are always issues that some people will separate from me on. But I don't give it a lot of thought. I am focused on the vision I have for the future. And the majority of Americans couldn't care less about what kind of church I go to. They care about what kind of president I would be. Lauer: But a recent survey found that 38 percent of white evangelical Protestants say they would have serious doubts about voting for a Mormon. Are you going to have to defend this faith or should you just come out with a Kennedy moment and say look folks here is the deal. Here is my faith. Here is what it is about. Here is what I stand for. Romney: Well, there may be well opportunities to do that. But whether and where I do that is a different question than whether the American people think there should be a religious test applied to somebody who is running for office. Lauer: You don't think there will be? Romney: I don't think there will be. Utah Senator Bob Bennett agrees with Romney. He told the Deseret Morning News he doesn't think Romney's faith will interfere with the outcome of the race because many Republicans like Romney's "family values." Bennett said they also like Romney because Republicans want a candidate who can beat Hillary Clinton. Bennett believes Romney is that guy, but says if Fred Thompson joins the race all that could change. It looks like it might happen. Thompson says he will form an exploratory committee next week.

Giuliani, the Republican former New York City mayor, flew into California for a couple of fundraisers, but took time out to shake hands and promote his candidacy to diners in Burlingame's Broadway retail district. Edwards, the Democratic former North Carolina senator, spent his day farther south, talking to a Silicon Valley crowd of about 1,000 at Google's Mountain View headquarters. Edwards talked about high-tech issues and the war in Iraq, but Giuliani was on the attack, chastising Democratic candidates Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama as tax-raising liberals who would cripple the state's economy. Giuliani painted himself as the only Republican candidate who is moderate enough to win a state like California in November 2008. Giuliani's comments Wednesday outside Burlingame's Broadway Grill highlighted the political schizophrenia he faces, trying to appeal to the conservative Republicans needed to win the GOP nomination and the moderate independent, Democratic and GOP voters he must attract to have a chance at the presidency in the general election. Giuliani, who supports abortion rights and aggressively backed tougher firearm regulations in New York City, argued he is "the one Republican candidate who has a legitimate chance to win California'' -- a state dominated by Democrats. Giuliani said Republicans must be able to compete in other Democratic strongholds such as Connecticut, New York and Oregon if they intend to keep the White House in 2008. But the former mayor also gave the party's conservative wing a bow when he slammed Clinton, a New York senator, and Obama, a senator from Illinois, as free-spending backers of big government "who don't seem to really understand how the private economy works.'' Obama's call Tuesday for a national health care plan is expensive support for socialized medicine, Giuliani said, while Clinton's plan to eliminate President Bush's tax cuts for the richest Americans would result in huge tax increases that "would hurt our economy. It would hurt this area traumatically.'' "We are the party of lower taxes and less government,'' Giuliani said. "They are the party of higher taxes and more government.'' Edwards' visit to Google came as he seeks to distinguish his message in the Democratic contest largely dominated thus far by Clinton and Obama. He touched on his plans for providing more Internet access and other tech-friendly issues, but appeared more eager to cement his identity as the toughest anti-war candidate among the leading Democrats. "I voted for the war, and it was a huge mistake and it was wrong, and I have a responsibility for that ... I'll have to live with that,'' he said. "The way the war in Iraq has been conducted has been a catastrophe for America. ... "The Congress has the power to stop this war ... the question is, do they have the backbone to stop it,'' he said in a thinly veiled slap at Clinton, Obama and the other Democratic candidates now in Congress. Edwards argued that Democrats in the House and Senate should have continued to send Bush war spending legislation tied to troop withdrawals rather than giving in after the president's veto. "This is life and death -- literally. ... We have a moral responsibility to those men and women,'' he said. Edwards continued to apologize when he was asked why he ever voted to authorize the war in Iraq. "I made the decision ... I did think the evidence was overwhelming about weapons of mass destruction, and I decided to defer to the president of the United States ... (but) I shouldn't have done it.'' It wasn't all tough talk. Edwards laughed when one questioner, Tom Zhang, a Google technology recruiter, made a reference to recent headlines about the candidate's expensive haircuts, saying "I like your haircut.'' "I wondered if I could get through this without that,'' Edwards said wryly. E-mail the writers at This article appeared on page Get up to 50% off home delivery of the Chronicle for 12 weeks!

Champion Spellers Discuss Life After the Spelling Bee What are the chances that you'll win the Scripps National Spelling Bee and become an unemployed drug-addicted criminal? "From what we know," said Paige Kimble, the Bee's director and the 1981 champ, "not good." PHOTOS: Pained Faces, Braces at Bee In Shadow of Parents' Deportation, Boy Fails to Clear Bee Hurdle Spelling Reformers Picket Bee, Say 'Enuf is Enuf' National Spelling Bee Youngsters Advance Spellers Gear Up for National Spelling Bee 286 Contestants Start Spelling Bee Though Scripps, the media company that runs the Bee, does not track all its winners through life, "of those we know about, you'll see many are doctors, scientists, lawyers and writers," she said. "We have a sense and anecdotal evidence &#0133 [that] our winners generally become successful, though not necessarily famous." The winners on whom Scripps has kept tabs include a host of Ivy League graduates, physicians, business executives, a former NASA areospace engineer, a professor of pediatrics, and a 93-year-old electrical engineer who in 1925 took home his $500 prize in gold pieces. Several former champs have written books about spelling, comment for television about the Bee and work as Bee staffers. One young speller who has met with a certain modicum of fame is George Thampy. Now 19 and a soon-to-be sophomore at Harvard, Thampy was featured in "Spellbound," a documentary film that profiled eight competitors preparing and competing in the 1999 national Bee. "Spelling takes a lot of hard work," said Thampy, who plans to major in chemistry or English and has his eye on medical school. That hard work -- with its attendant lessons in persistence, discipline and dedication -- pays dividends later in life, he and other former spelling champs told ABC News in the lead up to the 80th Scripps National Spelling Bee finals to be aired on ABC tomorrow night. Though he came up short in 1999, during his second trip to the finals, he bested competitors from across the country and around the English-speaking world the following year. His winning word in 2000 was "demarche," which means a formal protest, usually issued by a diplomat. In "Spellbound," Thampy comes off as a precocious 11-year-old dedicated to his studies and devout in his religion. A first- generation American, and the son of Indian immigrants, Thampy said he lost three times at local competitions and twice at the nationals before winning in 2000. Thampy remains aspirational; he has set his eyes on new heights and turned a work ethic honed in the crucible of competitive spelling toward other pursuits. "I am constantly striving, never looking back and never looking down. There are always new mountains to climb. The ones you have scaled are dwarfed by the ones above you. I don't look back at the old mountain, but I realize I have the skills and tools to move forward," Thampy said from the sidelines of this year's Bee. How Do You Spell Success?

Lauer and Romney were seated in the moving SUV during the interview. After the piece aired this morning, Lauer told his audience that even though New Hampshire doesn't have a mandatory seat belt law, he set the wrong example by not wearing one. He noted a recent interview he conducted with New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, who was nearly killed in a car crash while not wearing a seat belt. The Romney campaign issued a statement with a similar apology, admitting that he sometimes forgets to wear a seat belt and needs to remind himself to always buckle up.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Correction to This Article An earlier version of this column incorrectly stated that I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby was convicted in February. He was convicted in March. Fitzgerald Again Points to Cheney Tuesday, May 29, 2007; 1:14 PM Special counsel Patrick J. Fitzgerald has made it clearer than ever that he was hot on the trail of a coordinated campaign to out CIA agent Valerie Plame until that line of investigation was cut off by the repeated lies from Vice President Cheney's former chief of staff, I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby. Libby was convicted in March of perjury and obstruction of justice. Fitzgerald filed a memo on Friday asking U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton, who will sentence Libby next week, to put him in prison for at least two and a half years.

More White House Links Yahoo News Full Coverage Latest Job Approval Polls White House Web Site White House Press Releases White House Press Briefings Live White House Video Feed Global Message of the Day Save & Share Article Despite all the public interest in the case, Fitzgerald has repeatedly asserted that grand-jury secrecy rules prohibit him from being more forthcoming about either the course of his investigation or any findings beyond those he disclosed to make the case against Libby. But when his motives have been attacked during court proceedings, Fitzgerald has occasionally shown flashes of anger -- and has hinted that he and his investigative team suspected more malfeasance at higher levels of government than they were able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. In Friday's eminently readable , Fitzgerald quotes the Libby defense calling his prosecution "unwarranted, unjust, and motivated by politics." In responding to that charge, the special counsel evidently felt obliged to put Libby's crime in context. And that context is Dick Cheney. Libby's lies, Fitzgerald wrote, "made impossible an accurate evaluation of the role that Mr. Libby and those with whom he worked played in the disclosure of information regarding Ms. Wilson's CIA employment and about the motivations for their actions." It was established at trial that it was Cheney himself who first told Libby about Plame's identity as a CIA agent, in the course of complaining about criticisms of the administration's run-up to war leveled by her husband, former ambassador Joseph Wilson. And, as Fitzgerald notes: "The evidence at trial further established that when the investigation began, Mr. Libby kept the Vice President apprised of his shifting accounts of how he claimed to have learned about Ms. Wilson's CIA employment." The investigation, Fitzgerald writes, "was necessary to determine whether there was concerted action by any combination of the officials known to have disclosed the information about Ms. Plame to the media as anonymous sources, and also whether any of those who were involved acted at the direction of others. This was particularly important in light of Mr. Libby's statement to the FBI that he may have discussed Ms. Wilson's employment with reporters at the specific direction of the Vice President Not clear on the concept yet? Fitzgerald adds: "To accept the argument that Mr. Libby's prosecution is the inappropriate product of an investigation that should have been closed at an early stage, one must accept the proposition that the investigation should have been closed after at least three high-ranking government officials were identified as having disclosed to reporters classified information about covert agent Valerie Wilson, where the account of one of them was directly contradicted by other witnesses, where there was reason to believe that some of the relevant activity may have been coordinated, and where there was an indication from Mr. Libby himself that his disclosures to the press may have been personally sanctioned by the Vice President Up until now, Fitzgerald's most singeing attack on Cheney came during closing arguments at the Libby trial in February. Libby's lawyers had complained that Fitzgerald was trying to put a "cloud" over Cheney without evidence to back it up -- and that set Fitzgerald off. As I wrote in my , the special counsel responded with fire: "There is a cloud over what the Vice President did that week. . . . He had those meetings. He sent Libby off to [meet then-New York Times reporter] Judith Miller at the St. Regis Hotel. At that meeting, the two-hour meeting, the defendant talked about the wife. We didn't put that cloud there. That cloud remains because the defendant has obstructed justice and lied about what happened. . . . "That's not something that we put there. That cloud is something that we just can't pretend isn't there." To those of us watching the investigation and trial unfold, Cheney's presence behind the scenes has emerged in glimpses and hints.

Giuliani, the Republican former New York City mayor, flew into California for a couple of fundraisers, but took time out to shake hands and promote his candidacy to diners in Burlingame's Broadway retail district. Edwards, the Democratic former North Carolina senator, spent his day farther south, talking to a Silicon Valley crowd of about 1,000 at Google's Mountain View headquarters. Edwards talked about high-tech issues and the war in Iraq, but Giuliani was on the attack, chastising Democratic candidates Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama as tax-raising liberals who would cripple the state's economy. Giuliani painted himself as the only Republican candidate who is moderate enough to win a state like California in November 2008. Giuliani's comments Wednesday outside Burlingame's Broadway Grill highlighted the political schizophrenia he faces, trying to appeal to the conservative Republicans needed to win the GOP nomination and the moderate independent, Democratic and GOP voters he must attract to have a chance at the presidency in the general election. Giuliani, who supports abortion rights and aggressively backed tougher firearm regulations in New York City, argued he is "the one Republican candidate who has a legitimate chance to win California'' -- a state dominated by Democrats. Giuliani said Republicans must be able to compete in other Democratic strongholds such as Connecticut, New York and Oregon if they intend to keep the White House in 2008. But the former mayor also gave the party's conservative wing a bow when he slammed Clinton, a New York senator, and Obama, a senator from Illinois, as free-spending backers of big government "who don't seem to really understand how the private economy works.'' Obama's call Tuesday for a national health care plan is expensive support for socialized medicine, Giuliani said, while Clinton's plan to eliminate President Bush's tax cuts for the richest Americans would result in huge tax increases that "would hurt our economy. It would hurt this area traumatically.'' "We are the party of lower taxes and less government,'' Giuliani said. "They are the party of higher taxes and more government.'' Edwards' visit to Google came as he seeks to distinguish his message in the Democratic contest largely dominated thus far by Clinton and Obama. He touched on his plans for providing more Internet access and other tech-friendly issues, but appeared more eager to cement his identity as the toughest anti-war candidate among the leading Democrats. "I voted for the war, and it was a huge mistake and it was wrong, and I have a responsibility for that ... I'll have to live with that,'' he said. "The way the war in Iraq has been conducted has been a catastrophe for America. ... "The Congress has the power to stop this war ... the question is, do they have the backbone to stop it,'' he said in a thinly veiled slap at Clinton, Obama and the other Democratic candidates now in Congress. Edwards argued that Democrats in the House and Senate should have continued to send Bush war spending legislation tied to troop withdrawals rather than giving in after the president's veto. "This is life and death -- literally. ... We have a moral responsibility to those men and women,'' he said. Edwards continued to apologize when he was asked why he ever voted to authorize the war in Iraq. "I made the decision ... I did think the evidence was overwhelming about weapons of mass destruction, and I decided to defer to the president of the United States ... (but) I shouldn't have done it.'' It wasn't all tough talk. Edwards laughed when one questioner, Tom Zhang, a Google technology recruiter, made a reference to recent headlines about the candidate's expensive haircuts, saying "I like your haircut.'' "I wondered if I could get through this without that,'' Edwards said wryly. E-mail the writers at This article appeared on page Get up to 50% off home delivery of the Chronicle for 12 weeks!

Earlier, CBS News reported National Weather Service forecasters believed that 3 to 5 of the storms will be Category 3 or higher. Gray, based at Colorado State University, described it as a very active season. He said there was a 74 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall somewhere on the U.S. coast. There is a 50 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the East Coast, including the Florida Peninsula, according to the new forecast; the long-term average is 31 percent. The chance of a major hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast between the Florida Panhandle and Brownsville, Texas, is 49 percent; the long-term average is 30 percent. There is also an above-average chance of a major hurricane making landfall in the Caribbean, according to the forecast. Thursday's forecast was largely unchanged from Gray's last forecast, released in early April. "We expect an above-average hurricane season," said Phil Klotzbach, a member of Gray's team and lead author of the forecast. The hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30, averages 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes per year. There were 10 named Atlantic storms last year and five hurricanes, two of them major. None of the hurricanes hit the U.S. Atlantic coast. The devastating 2005 season set a record with 28 named storms, 15 of them hurricanes. Four hurricanes hit the U.S. coast, the worst among them Katrina, which devastated parts of the Gulf Coast.

This Week in Weddings Wedding of the Week Planning Ideas & Advice Jury Selection Underway In Seale Trial Jury Selection Begins in Seale Trial Jury selection began Wednesday in the trial of reputed Klansman James Ford Seale. The 71 year old is accused of kidnapping and conspiracy in the 1964 murders of two black teenagers in Franklin County. Its been nearly half a century since 19 year olds Henry Dee and Charles Moore were abducted, beaten, and dumped in the Mississippi River. Several of their siblings traveled from across the country to see James Ford Seale tried in their murders. "It took a lot out of us already," said Henry Dee&#39;s older sister, Thelma Collins. "Sometimes you&#39;ll get to thinking about it and you&#39;ll shed tears every now and then." "This crime has caused me to have bad dreams, nightmares, lost my whole family," said Thomas Moore, Charles Moore&#39;s brother. Seale has been in jail since his arrest in January. Instead of an orange jumpsuit, he appeared in court Wednesday in khakis and a blue button down. Seeing him was painful for Dee&#39;s sisters. "It hurt," said Collins. "I&#39;m not going to say it didn&#39;t hurt." A group of 76 potential jurors was narrowed down to 55 Wednesday. That is out of a larger group of 300 who were summoned from 45 counties in the Southern portion of the state. Jurors&#39; names will be kept secret, because the case involves Klan activities. It could be a lengthy trial, but one that&#39;s worth the wait for the victims&#39; families. "This is what the whole system is about," said Moore. "Justice. It&#39;s about the right people and the right time doing the right thing." Jury selection continues at 9AM Thursday in Judge Henry Wingate&#39;s courtroom. The judge instructed the potential jurors not to read or watch any news. During questioning Wednesday, one potential juror mentioned Seale by name. So the group now knows that it&#39;s this high profile case they may be deciding. All content &copy; Copyright 2001 - 2007 WorldNow and WLBT, a All Rights Reserved.

The fees that immigrants pay to request "green cards" will nearly triple to $930. The cost of renewing working permits jumps 89 percent to $340. And applying for citizenship will cost $595, an increase of $265. Some children will pay less and immigrants who fall under the federal poverty line can apply for waivers, but most others will have to cough up more cash. Immigration officials, who have hired staff and reallocated resources during the past year to reduce a years-long backlog to about six months, say the increases are necessary because the agency is solely funded by user fees. The increases will raise more than $2 billion, according to immigration officials. But immigrants and their advocates complain that these costs are excessive for people who often are struggling to settle here while helping relatives in their homelands. Under Secretary Emilio Gonzalez, head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, unveiled the fee revisions in January, as the first major overhaul of immigration costs since 1998. The fees will become final after a public-comment period. Gonzalez said in a written statement that the new fees are "both fair to our customers and vital to our Nation as we continue to build a secure and efficient national immigration service." But some say the costs make citizenship less affordable. "This is ridiculous," said Gail Seeram, an Orlando immigration attorney who files applications for many West Indian clients in Central Florida. "These aren't filing fees. These are penalties. . . . If you examine any other government fee structure in the U.S., there is none with such unrealistic set of fees." Since higher fees were proposed earlier this year, many who qualified for citizenship but had not yet requested it rushed to submit their petitions. A recent Orlando Sentinel analysis of filings during the past few months showed that immigrants have filed citizenship applications in record numbers. At least 118,600 immigrants across the country requested citizenship in March, compared with about 74,200 in March 2006. In Florida, the number of citizenship applications was about 31,000 in the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 62 percent over the previous year. Applications for green cards, the documents that entitle immigrants to live and work here legally, also increased in Florida and the U.S. Miriam Vazquez, 37, a Dominican immigrant who works in a factory in east Orlando, was filling out her citizenship application Tuesday because she had heard buzz about the fee increase. Vazquez said that even at the current cost of about $400 for a citizenship application with fingerprinting and photos, she had to save for weeks to scrape the money together. "With the minimum wage we make in this state, it's too little money to pay for all that," Vazquez said. "I am trying to rush and do it now, because it's going to cost more." Richard Logue, who directs the Catholic Immigration and Refugee Services program of Catholic Charities in Orlando, said his office has seen more inquiries from immigrants. Especially burdened, he said, are those who need to file "adjustment of status" forms to request green cards. Those applications will go from $325 to $930, a 186 percent increase. Many who file that application also need to request a work permit, which will jump from $180 to $340 every year. Waivers of those fees, Logue said, are usually difficult to obtain for most immigrants. "Families had a difficult time coming up with the old fees in our experience," Logue said, "so some working-class families will perhaps have to forgo getting their papers and citizenship." Anne Yamasaki, 72, a German immigrant in Rockledge, is dependent on Social Security. She says she can't spare the extra $100 her green-card renewal will cost next year. She won't even think about applying for citizenship, even though she has lived in the U.S. for more than 40 years, because of the cost. But she also wants to see more-efficient service than she did during her last visit to the immigration office in south Orlando. "I live on a very limited income," Yamasaki said. "But it might be worth it, because last time I went to immigration I was standing in a little alleyway for hours." President Bush defends immigration reform.

USA TODAY On Politics Run also a race for campaign funds By Fredreka Schouten, USA TODAY WASHINGTON &#151; Fred Thompson's nascent presidential campaign already has the backing of Tennessee Republicans who have long track records collecting money for White House contenders. The former senator, however, will have to move quickly to expand his support to catch up to his leading GOP rivals, in a race where several candidates are expected to raise as much as $100 million before the 2008 primaries. On Tuesday, Thompson made an appeal to 100 supporters, asking them to each raise $46,000. "Fred Thompson is a seasoned politician with a strong network of friends and supporters," said Lewis Eisenberg, a former Republican National Committee finance chairman. Given the shortened primary season, however, "time is running out," he said. For his presidential race, Thompson can draw on his years as a lawyer and lobbyist. Lawyers and law firm employees were the biggest contributors to Thompson's two Senate campaigns and to his political action committee, giving more than $570,000 since 1993, according to campaign-finance data tallied by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics. Trial lawyers have proved a rich vein of political donations for Democratic contenders, but Thompson's past opposition to some federal efforts to limit lawsuits also makes him appealing to this group, said Linda Lipsen, senior vice president of public affairs at the American Association for Justice, which represents trial lawyers. In 2002, for instance, Thompson voted against limiting medical malpractice lawsuits. Thompson's acting roles &#8212; including as the fictional District Attorney Arthur Branch on NBC's &#8212; also give him access to another source of campaign money: Hollywood. People in the television, movie and music business have contributed more than $160,000 to Thompson, the center's data show. These donors include actor and writer Ben Stein, who gave $1,000 to Thompson in 1998. Stein did not return telephone messages. By waiting until now to voice his White House intentions, Thompson lost the support of one of the GOP's top fundraisers, Ted Welch. The Nashville-based investor is aiding Mitt Romney, who leads the Republican field in fundraising. Romney raised nearly $21 million in the first three months of this year, and has collected more from Tennesseans than anyother presidential contender in either party, according to his campaign-finance reports. "A lot of high-powered people have called me about supporting Fred," said Welch, who chose Romney after another former Tennessee senator, Bill Frist, opted not to run. Welch isn't budging. "If you commit to somebody, you're committed," he said. James Haslam II &#8212; who, like Welch, is a major fundraiser for President Bush and a Tennessean &#8212; predicted Thompson could sway uncommitted people. "I think there's still money there to be raised," he said. Thompson's plans for extensive Internet outreach give him the potential to move beyond the traditional GOP fundraising base, online experts say. "He has more of an Internet presence than any announced candidate," said David All, a GOP online strategist. "There's a heck of a lot more donors who can give $5 or $10 on the Internet than those who can give $2,300." Thompson supporters said they are confident about his ability to raise money. "Fred Thompson is running second and third place in polls, and he hasn't spent a nickel," spokesman Mark Corallo said. "There are a couple of campaigns that have raised an enormous amount of money and have spent an enormous amount of money, and it hasn't done anything for them."

Jon Corzine about the governor's near-fatal car crash while riding without wearing a safety belt. A few weeks after that chat, there was Lauer on "Today" on Wednesday, sitting in the back of a moving sport utility vehicle while interviewing Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney. Both men were unbuckled. A sheepish Lauer admitted his mistake after "Today" ran the interview, which was conducted Tuesday. "I should have set a better example," he said. Romney also said he needs to keep reminding himself to buckle up. Corzine was riding in a State Police-driven SUV that crashed going 91 mph on April 12 along the Garden State Parkway. Corzine, unbuckled in the front passenger seat, broke his leg, 11 ribs, collarbone and sternum. He voluntarily paid a $46 fine and apologized to the state. He also released a public service announcement urging people to wear seat belts. "Today" show producers noticed the oversight before the segment with Romney aired and decided to have Lauer address it, executive producer Jim Bell said. Viewers certainly noticed. "Today" got more than 100 e-mails about Lauer and Romney's oversights while the segment was being telecast, Bell said. "It was amazing," he said.

Guards at the U.S. Naval Base in southeast Cuba found the detainee in his cell unresponsive and not breathing Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. military's Southern Command said in a statement. "They tried to save his life but he was pronounced dead," said Mario Alvarez, a Miami-based spokesman for the command. It would be the fourth suicide at Guantanamo since the prison camp opened in January 2002. On June 10, 2006, two Saudi detainees and one Yemeni hanged themselves with sheets. Details, including the prisoner's name and manner of death, were not released. A spokesman for detention operations, Navy Cmdr. Rick Haupt, declined to comment, referring questions to the Miami-based Southern Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Caribbean and Latin America. The death came as the U.S. military prepared to try two detainees - Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni, and Omar Khadr, a Canadian who was 15 when he was captured in a firefight with U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Their arraignment is scheduled to proceed on Monday at Guantanamo as planned, Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon, a Pentagon spokesman, said late Wednesday. Khadr on Wednesday fired his American attorneys, leaving him without defense counsel as his arraignment approaches, his former U.S. military attorney said. "He doesn't trust American lawyers, and I don't particularly blame him," said U.S. Marine Lt. Col. Colby Vokey, who was taken off the case Wednesday. "The United States is responsible for his interrogation and his treatment under a process that is patently unfair." The military toughened security at the prison camp following the previous suicides and an uprising last spring, taking measures to remove access to light fixtures and other possible makeshift weapons. About 380 men are held at the isolated prison camp on suspicion of links to al-Qaida or the Taliban. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service is conducting an ongoing investigation into the three previous suicides. A cultural adviser was helping the military handle the remains. "The remains of the deceased detainee are being treated with the utmost respect," the military said. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free!

Fred Thompson plans to begin formally "testing the waters" for a Republican presidential run receives heavy coverage, with all three networks covering it -- two in depth -- and most major national newspapers putting the story on the front page. Coverage is generally sympathetic toward the new candidate, noting his Hollywood fame and his appeal to conservatives in the unsettled GOP race. Many reports mention Thompson's desire to evoke thoughts of an earlier actor-politician, Ronald Reagan. However, some stories have an undercurrent of doubt about, in ABC's words, Thompson's "lack of legislative accomplishments" during his Senate tenure. reported, "Ten Republicans are already running. How about number 11?" Thompson "lawyer, actor, former senator -- will file papers Monday to begin raising money, the first step toward candidacy. Thompson is expected to announce as early as the Fourth of July." ABC, noting his Hollywood career, added, "But playing a president is a lot easier than being one." In a 2,000-word front-page story, says Thompson "has been coy with audiences as he flirts with a bid," but in an interview with the newspaper, he "makes it clear that he plans to run, he describes how he aims to do it. He's planning a campaign that will use blogs, video posts and other Internet innovations to reach voters repelled by politics-as-usual in both parties." In his column, Robert Novak says Thompson suggested at a Tuesday dinner with "20 fellow conservatives, mostly journalists," that "his candidacy will be different from other Republicans, in both substance and style." Thompson "envisions a 21st-century campaign, using the Internet more and spending less than his opponents." , also on its front page, says Thompson's backers "hope his name recognition as an actor and radio commentator, conservative stands on issues like immigration and government spending, and strength in the South will differentiate him from the current crop of candidates." Under the perhaps inevitable headline "Thompson Prepares For Biggest Role Yet," the also says that as a "plain-spoken southern Republican with a solidly conservative voting record," Thompson "would hope to become the consensus candidate the party is so far lacking." says Thompson will position himself "as a down-home antidote to Washington politics" and will run his "campaign out of Nashville while promising leadership on a conservative agenda that will appeal to his party's base." The Post says his entry will add "a fourth candidate to the field's top tier," since Giuliani, McCain, and Romney "have struggled to win the confidence of conservative Republicans." But GOP strategists "cautioned that Thompson will need a more refined message and an error-free start to live up to the publicity surrounding his all-but-certain candidacy." The New Hampshire Union Leader also says "polls indicate he would start in the first tier of candidates." says Thompson "has been keeping a high profile in conservative circles and preparing behind the scenes to start a campaign. He has gathered a cadre of senior advisors that includes" former RNC political director Ken Rietz and former Federal Election Commission chairman Michael Toner. says Thompson "will have to move quickly to expand his support to catch up to his leading GOP rivals, in a race where several candidates are expected to raise as much as $100 million before the 2008 primaries." Effect On GOP Top-Tier Candidates Remains Unclear focused on "how this affects the already crowded field." NBC (Russert): "The Fred Thompson campaign senses an unease among the top Republican contenders amongst the conservative base, and that Thompson will try to cast himself as a consistent conservative and try to fill that vacuum." Giuliani's campaign "expects their candidate will take a hit initially in the polls that some of their supporters who gravitated Giuliani will go to Thompson, feeling more comfortable with his conservative credentials, but it will also unsettle the race. If you talk to the Mitt Romney people, it says he'll hurt John McCain because he supported John McCain in 2000. And they have to raise money from similar places. McCain says, no that's not the case, he'll hurt Romney, because Romney had got some momentum, particularly in Iowa, and this now shakes up the race and makes Romney look less conservative than Fred Thompson." says Thompson "is likely to cut into support for a prominent real-life ex-prosecutor, Rudolph Giuliani." While some analysts said Romney "has the most to lose if Thompson can pick up the conservative voters Romney is banking on," Giuliani "would suffer too if conservatives rally to Thompson's side and see in him what they have seen in the ex-mayor -- an electable candidate with the aura of celebrity." However, Giuliani backer Rep. Peter King said he "believes voters will see the difference between real life and TV when they are looking for a strong leader." King said, "Rudy had 9/11, and Fred Thompson had 'Law & Order.'" Thompson Likely To Be On Ames Straw Poll Ballot reports Thompson will probably be on Iowa's August 11 Ames straw poll ballot "whether he wants to be or not." While "some Thompson advisers are urging him not to contest the straw poll," the event "is run by the Iowa Republican Party, and the party's members, not the candidates, decide which contenders are listed." Obama, Romney Focus On Foreign Policy reports Sen. Barack Obama and Mitt Romney "outline their respective foreign policy visions in lengthy articles in the next issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, offering sharp contrasts on issues including the war in Iraq and climate change." Obama "calls the Bush administration's Iraq policies 'tragically misguided' and advocates a phased withdrawal of U.S. combat forces, to be completed by next March," while Romney "notes that there is 'no guarantee' that the administration's current strategy will succeed but says that 'the stakes are too high and the potential fallout too great to deny our military leaders and troops on the ground the resources and the time needed to give it an opportunity.'"

Hillary Clinton responded to the lawsuit brought by shareholders of InfoUSA against chief executive Vinod Gupta for allowing Clinton to travel aboard company planes by saying "that she followed all Senate rules" and that her acceptance of this travel did not negate her criticisms of "corporate America's largesse and skyrocketing executive pay." Calling Gupta a "longtime benefactor," the AP notes that "Clinton's campaign has said she reimbursed Gupta at the cost of a first-class flight, typically a significant discount off the expense of a private jet." Brownback Expands On Evolution Views op-ed called "What I Think About Evolution," Sen. Sam Brownback writes, "I suppose I should not have been surprised earlier this month when, during the first Republican presidential debate, the candidates on stage were asked to raise their hands if they did not 'believe' in evolution. As one of those who raised his hand, I think it would be helpful to discuss the issue in a bit more detail and with the seriousness it demands. The premise behind the question seems to be that if one does not unhesitatingly assert belief in evolution, then one must necessarily believe that God created the world and everything in it in six 24-hour days. But limiting this question to a stark choice between evolution and creationism does a disservice to the complexity of the interaction between science, faith and reason." Tancredo Has "Cult Following" profiles "Rep. Tom Tancredo: A Lightning Rod On Immigration." The Tribune says Tancredo's "crusade to have every illegal immigrant in the country deported and to make English the country's official language has inspired a cult following for this grandson of Italian immigrants, attracting white supremacists and PTA moms alike." While his presidential bid "is widely regarded as a long shot, the reaction he has received so far in Iowa shows his campaign can't be entirely dismissed, political analysts say." FEC: Kerry Violated Spending Limits reports a Federal Election Commission draft audit says Sen. John Kerry's publicly funded 2004 presidential campaign "broke spending limits by nearly $1.4 million during his 2004 presidential bid, including some funds spent on customizing his campaign jets." The FEC "could rule that Kerry's campaign must reimburse the government." says Kerry-Edwards lawyer Marc Elias "says the campaign stayed within the limits and accused the commission's auditors of taking 'an unsupportably aggressive view of the law.'" to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. Bush Sees Korea When He Looks At Iraq The White House on Wednesday offered the US military mission in South Korea as a model for its role in Iraq. The suggestion drew skeptical treatment from the media, as well as renewed questions about the success of the Iraq troop "surge." The reports White House press secretary Tony Snow "told reporters that" President Bush "believes US forces eventually will end their combat role in Iraq but will continue to be needed in the country to deter threats and to help handle potential crises, as they have done in South Korea." The reports the comparison between Iraq and South Korea "was offered as the Pentagon announced the completion of the troop buildup ordered by Bush in January. The last of about 21,500 combat troops to arrive were an Army brigade in Baghdad and a Marine unit heading into the Anbar province in western Iraq." runs a brief report on Snow's comments under the headline "Bush Sees Troops In Iraq For 'Long Time,'" while the portrays the new "model" as a consequence of the possible failure of the current "surge." A "resurgence of sectarian violence and attacks on US troops, coupled with little to no progress on crucial Iraqi political goals, is already spurring discussion about whether the current strategy can succeed." David Broder, in a column titled "Endgame Ahead," writes in the that "the end is coming into view -- not soon enough to spare every precious life, but sooner than President Bush and Vice President Cheney may wish. The dynamic in Congress has been set in motion that will bring this war to an end -- or at least reduce the scale of American involvement and redefine the mission of U.S. troops." Petraeus: Iraqis Must Take Opportunity interviewed Gen, David Petraeus, who said, "Everyone is impatient, including the Iraqi leaders. And what we have to see, now, is, in fact, whether they can make the most of this opportunity that our soldiers and their soldiers are fighting and dying to give to them." Maliki Warns Of Iraqi Army Coup Schemes interviewed Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki, who said, "I have to watch the army because those still loyal to the previous regime may start planning coups. Those people don't believe in democracy and for that reason we are monitoring the status of the army very carefully." Bush Team Considers New Media Outreach Current and former Bush administration communications officials tell the US News Political Bulletin that they now believe they relied too heavily on traditional media and the White House press corps to get out the President's message about the broader war on terrorism and the booming economy. "We didn't use the new tools of communication" like the Internet, blogs and mobile technology, said a former key official. As a result, added another official, the President's message was filtered through the mainstream press which eventually got bored with the story and stopped reporting the President's repetitive messages. "You've got to use the new tools. They can reach far more people than TV or the papers," said an administration official. "A video on the Internet or some blogging can reach millions and we should have played with that much more," said the official. White House insiders, however, dismissed the complaints, mostly from former communications officials, claiming that they have worked with bloggers and non-traditional media but that the tide has turned against them. The White House lessons are being played out on the 2008 presidential campaign where several former Bush aides are working for GOP candidates who are relying more on Internet and blog-based communications than the traditional TV ads and national press corps. "We've got to learn to communicate in a different way," said an advisor to likely GOP candidate Fred Thompson. DOJ Probe: The Plot Thickens After Monica Goodling, a former Justice Department aide, testified last week that she "crossed the line" by using political affiliation as a criteria for hiring decisions, the DOJ inspector general and other ethics officials have expanded their investigation. reports Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine and Counsel Marshall Jarrett of the Office of Professional Responsibility, "which investigates misconduct within the agency, sent a letter to Congress on Wednesday saying they are also looking into the program for hiring entry-level lawyers and summer interns." The says the "expanded investigation also appears to reflect concerns among a growing number of career employees at the Justice Department who have suggested that politics have compromised the hiring process at the department during the Bush administration." And the says the "widening inquiry is likely to pose an additional challenge for Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales." While the US attorney "dismissals have prompted wide political criticism, improper hiring practices could be deemed a violation of the law." reports it "couldn't be determined whether the Goodling inquiry will be expanded to include what direction she received from higher-ups within the department or the White House. The announcement Wednesday, however, indicated that the internal inquiry is looking more broadly at charges of politicization across the department." The runs a similar report. Pattern Seen In Minnesota Case reports that by the time Minnesota US Attorney Tom Heffelfinger "resigned last year, his office had collected a string of awards and commendations from the Justice Department. So it came as a surprise -- and something of a mystery -- when he turned up on a list of U.S. attorneys who had been targeted for firing." But "part of the reason, government documents and other evidence suggest, is that he tried to protect voting rights for Native Americans." to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. Bush AIDS Proposal Widely Praised In what has become a rare occurrence, a proposal by President Bush yesterday is earning praise from almost all corners. reported Bush "says he wants to double America's commitment to fighting AIDS in Africa." Bush is asking Congress "to authorize an additional $30 billion for his AIDS program over a period of five years." called Bush's proposed funding increase "dramatic." Under the headline "Bush AIDS Plan Gets Bipartisan Praise," the says Bush's proposal "was met yesterday with broad support uncommon in Washington. International aid organizations, advocacy groups and members of Congress from both parties offered praise for the proposal -- even if some argued that the proposed increase is insufficient." The notes Bush also "announced that his wife, Laura, will visit four African countries -- Zambia, Mali, Mozambique and Senegal -- that have benefited from the U.S. program and report back to him on her findings. The trip will take place June 25-29." says Bush's proposal "comes a week before he and other leaders will discuss AIDS and Africa at the Group of Eight summit of leading industrialized nations." Among the few who criticized Bush plan, says the , was Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee, who "said the government should also boost spending on malaria and tuberculosis, and on related efforts that are not part of the program but could bolster the fight against HIV/AIDS, including education, nutrition, water, food security and healthcare workers." Praising Bush's announcement, meanwhile, was Bono. reports "the Grammy-winning rock star sang Bush's praises Wednesday" in a phone interview from Morocco. reports White House counselor Dan Bartlett "said the president was convinced America's image in the world would improve because" of initiatives like this one. Jenna Bush's Book On AIDS-Stricken Girl reports in its "Reliable Source" column that Bush twin Jenna "completes her transformation from party girl to global activist this weekend when she starts the promotional rounds for her book, 'Ana's Story: A Journey of Hope.'" Bush, 25, will "appear Saturday at N.Y.C.'s BookExpo America, meeting with booksellers to spike sales and generate buzz." A "peek at the 296-page advance manuscript shows a strong narrative as Bush traces the life of a 17-year-old Panamanian girl living with HIV-AIDS." Pay Discrimination Ruling Under Fire In the wake of the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision to limit employees' ability to sue for pay discrimination, the says congressional Democrats have pledged to reverse the outcome of the case through legislation. The decision is also generating significant media criticism, with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's outspoken dissent drawing positive media coverage. The reports that both in "the abortion case the court decided last month and the discrimination ruling it issued on Tuesday," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg "read forceful dissents from the bench." Ginsburg "may have concluded that quiet collegiality has proved futile and that her new colleagues, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., are not open to persuasion on the issues that matter most to her." says in an editorial, "The Supreme Court struck a blow for discrimination this week by stripping a key civil rights law of much of its potency. ... Fortunately, Congress can amend the law to undo this damaging decision. It should do so without delay." The writes "Ginsburg is clearly right on the policy: It's impossible for every victim of pay discrimination to know and take action within 180 days. Congress should adjust the law accordingly." And the editorializes that Ginsburg "attempted to call the court's attention to those real-world facts." Congress is "left to act because the Supreme Court has read the law so rigidly that it has misread life." to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. The Latest From Late Night Comedians The late-night political shows were reruns last night. to get the US News Political Bulletin emailed to you each morning at 8 a.m. Copyright &copy; 2007 by the Bulletin News Network, Inc. 7915 Jones Branch, Suite 6200 &bull; McLean, VA 22102 every weekday at 8 a.m. BEST CAREERS 2007 &raquo; Here's where &#151; and where not &#151; to look if you're considering a fresh career start in 2007.

http://www.newszap.com/articles/2007/05/30/fl/lake_okeechobee/aok04.txt&cid Published: May 30, 2007 - 07:31:44 pm EDT Area is now under tighter water limits By Pete Gawda, Okeechobee News On Wednesday, May 30, Lake Okeechobee tied the record low of 8.97 feet. This low has exposed many areas of the lake bottom; allowing water mangers to scrape muck from the dry lake bottom and haul it off. Here the muck from around the pier at Jaycees Park is being scraped up and hauled off. It is being spreading on public and privately owned properties. The near-record low level of Lake Okeechobee has forced tighter water restrictions in the areas around the lake. History was made on Wednesday, May 30, when Lake Okeechobee matched its previous all time recorded low of 8.97 feet. That low prompted South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) to impose Phase III water restrictions for the area around Lake Okeechobee including the Okeechobee area. Mandatory Phase III water use restrictions are now in effect for parts of Hendry, Glades, Okeechobee, Lee, Martin, St. Lucie and Palm Beach counties - roughly the area encircling Lake Okeechobee and along the Caloosahatchee Rivers. This includes utility customers in South Bay, Belle Glade, Pahokee, Okeechobee and Clewiston. Agriculture users in this area are required to reduce water use by 45 percent. Residential users must restrict lawn watering, boat and car washing to one day per week. People with odd numbered addresses can water their lawns on Saturdays from 4 until 8 a.m. Those with even numbered addresses can water on Sundays between 4 and 8 a.m. These restrictions do not apply to people who use a well. Officials with SFWMD urge people to use every means possible to conserve water even as we enter what is traditionally the rainy season. "In response to the rapid drop in Lake Okeechobee's water level, we are continuing to make the necessary decisions to help stretch water supplies," said Carol Ann Wehle, SFWMD executive director. "Tighter restrictions on the use of lake-connected surface water is one way to help us better manage the regional system." On Wednesday, the lake level continued its fall of over a year as it dropped to 8.97 feet above sea level tying the record low reached May 24, 2001. That measurement was derived from the average of four gauges scattered around the lake. One of the gauges is located in the northern area of the lake near Okeechobee. One is located on the west side of the lake west of Fisheating Creek. A third gauge is in the center of the lake, while the fourth is at the southern end of the lake near Pahokee. John Hayford, executive director of Okeechobee Utility Authority (OUA), said the utility has not experienced any problem yet with their water intake. He was guessing that the intake would be good for at least another 12-inch drop in lake levels. However, he noted that was just a guess since they are operating under unfamiliar conditions. The utility has a backup plan if their lake intake becomes unusable. A temporary rented pump has been installed on the Rim Canal. In about two months it will be replaced by a permanent pump to provide emergency water supplies in time of drought or hurricanes. The lake level is 3 feet below average for this time of year. However, the plummeting lake levels have at least one positive quality. The drought has exposed large areas of lake bottom. This allows water managers to scrape up accumulated muck from the now dry lake bottom and haul it off. "While the record level of Lake Okeechobee means that drought conditions are continuing, seizing this opportunity to clean the bottom of the lake now will ensure a healthier lake when the rains return," said Florida Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Michael W. Sole. Work is currently going on at South Bay, Fisheating Creek, Harney Pond, Horse Island, the northwest marsh near Buckhead Ridge and Eagle Bay. Muck removed from these areas is being hauled to inland sites. The work going on around the pier at Jaycees Park is part of the Eagle Bay project. That muck is being trucked to SFWMD-owned property on Limpkin Creek and to privately owned property. Ironically, rainfall levels recorded for the months of April and May at the Okeechobee County Airport have been higher than normal. As of midnight on May 29, 6.86 inches of rain fell at the airport during the month of May. The normal for the month is 3.93 inches. Vernon Gray, director of the airport, said that high total was due to thunderstorms on May 13, 14 and 18. Those three thunderstorms dropped an accumulation of 6.33 inches of rain on the airport. For a normal year, the rainfall accumulation by the end of May is 13.41 inches. As of midnight on May 29, 11.17 inches of rain had fallen for the year. For the past 17 months rainfall for Okeechobee is 5.64 inches below normal.

Jobs @ The Day Norwich Soldier&#39;s Death &#39;Great Loss&#39; For Family, Community Another young man from the region has died in Iraq. Once more our bell tolls. Again our hearts collectively ache for a promising young life ended far too soon. First Lt. Keith Heidtman of Norwich died when the Army helicopter he was co-piloting was shot down. He was 24. Lt. Heidtman was a graduate of Norwich Free Academy, where he was an honor student and athlete. He was also a 2005 graduate of the University of Connecticut, participating in the ROTC program. By all accounts, Lt. Heidtman&#39;s life held great promise. He was planning to head to law school after his military commitment ended. He was killed on Memorial Day. Those who gathered for ceremonies on village greens and lined up for local parades did not know then that one local young man had been added to the ranks of the honored dead they were remembering. Lt. Heidtman was one of 10 U.S. soldiers killed that day, all sacrificing their lives to try and bring order to a far-away country seemingly spinning out of control. On that same day two vehicle bombings in Baghdad killed 44 people, and the bodies of 32 men, shot and tortured, were discovered in two locations north and south of that anguished capital. While the parents of the newly dead were beginning a mourning process that will never fully end, Cindy Sheehan, the mother of another fallen soldier, Army Spc. Casey Sheehan, also 24 when killed, said she was withdrawing from her leadership role in the anti-war movement. Discouraged by the congressional vote to continue funding the war, Mrs. Sheehan said she was &#8220;going home for a while to try and be normal.&#8221; The harshest reality, wrote Mrs. Sheehan in an online diary, &#8220;was that Casey did, indeed, die for nothing.&#8221; She was wrong about that. The 3,467 military personnel so far killed during the Iraq conflict have died in service to their country, and that alone is a noble cause. And though many, including this newspaper, were critical of the decision to invade Iraq and have questioned the way it has been prosecuted, that does not make the service and sacrifice of our soldiers any less honorable. They were given the task of bringing down a dictator, and they did. They were then commissioned with providing security to a country divided by ancient religious and tribal animosities, so that democracy could take root. They have tried. Lt. Heidtman, we salute you.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Presidential Hopefuls Campaign in Calif. Thursday, May 31, 2007; 12:43 AM BURLINGAME, Calif. -- Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday declared that California's early primary has made the state more than a political ATM _ just as he accepted a check from a supporter and then headed to two fundraisers. California's Feb. 5 presidential primary seemed to be having a modest effect, with several major candidates blending their fundraising chores with campaign stops to greet potential voters. Mostly, however, the focus was on fundraising. Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani, center, shakes hands with supporter Mauro Bruschi, right, during a visit to Broadway Grill in Burlingame, Calif., Wednesday, May 30, 2007.(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Marcio Jose Sanchez - AP) In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article Democrats John Edwards and also trolled the nation's most delegate-rich state for cash and votes Wednesday. Between them, the three candidates held six California money events. Edwards, during an appearance between the four fundraisers he is holding over two days, decried the influence of money on politics and called for public financing of campaigns. "I'm not holier-than-thou about this. I've raised millions of dollars in 2004 and now to run for president," he added. "But that doesn't mean I think the system is good, because I don't." Giuliani stepped off a plane at San Francisco International Airport and promptly went to the Broadway Grill a few minutes away to chat with customers. His campaign ensured the lunchtime visit was stacked with supporters, sending out an e-mail Wednesday morning urging them to stop by the cafe en route to the fundraiser. Those crowded into the restaurant appeared to be a mix of regulars in T-shirts and committed supporters clad in suits and ties and bound for the fundraiser, which cost $250 and up. George Yerby handed the candidate a check for $200 on the spot. Giuliani hastily passed it to an aide. "He's going to be the next president," Yerby, 67, who lives in the wealthy Bay area enclave of Hillsborough, said afterward. "I hope." Giuliani closed his fundraisers here and in Beverly Hills to the public and news media. The restaurant stop, where he sipped orange juice and coffee, was open. He acknowledged to reporters outside the grill that raising money "has always been a big focus in California, like it was in New York."

Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Berkeley mom Sheehan bows out as anti-Iraq war leader DEMOS DISAPPOINT GRIEVING PARENT By Angela K. Brown Article Launched: 05/30/2007 01:32:48 AM PDT FORT WORTH, Texas - Cindy Sheehan, the California soldier's mother who galvanized an anti-war movement with her monthlong protest outside President Bush's ranch, said Tuesday she's done being the public face of the movement. "I've been wondering why I'm killing myself and wondering why the Democrats caved in to George Bush," Sheehan told the Associated Press while driving from her property in Crawford to the airport, where she planned to return to California. "I'm going home for a while to try and be normal," she said. In what she described as a "resignation letter," Sheehan wrote in her online diary on the Daily Kos blog: "Good-bye America. ... You are not the country that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I sacrifice, I can't make you be that country unless you want it. "It's up to you now." Sheehan began a grass-roots peace movement in August 2005 when she camped outside Bush's Crawford ranch for 26 days, demanding to talk with the president about her son's death. Army Spec. Casey Sheehan was 24 when he was killed in an ambush in Baghdad in 2004. Cindy Sheehan's protest started small but swelled to thousands and quickly drew national attention. Over the next two years, she drew huge crowds as she spoke at protest events. But she also drew criticism for some actions, such as meeting with Hugo Cha&#96;vez, Venezuela's leftist president. "I have endured a lot of smear and hatred since Casey was killed and especially since I became the so-called `face' of the American anti-war movement," Sheehan wrote in the diary. She had lived in Vacaville with her family, but when her marriage broke up in part because of her anti-war activism, she moved to Berkeley. Kristinn Taylor, spokesman for FreeRepublic.com, which has held pro-troop rallies and counterprotests of anti-war demonstrations, said dwindling crowds at Sheehan's Crawford protests since her initial vigil may have led to her decision. But he also said he hopes she will now be able to heal. "Her politics have hurt a lot of people, including the troops and their families. But most of us who support the war on terror understand she is hurt very deeply," Taylor said Tuesday. "Those she got involved with in the anti-war movement realize it was to their benefit to keep her in that stage of anger." When Sheehan first took on Bush, she was a darling of the liberal left. "However, when I started to hold the Democratic Party to the same standards that I held the Republican Party, support for my cause started to erode and the `left' started labeling me with the same slurs that the right used," she wrote in the diary. She said she sacrificed a 29-year marriage and endured threats to put all her energy into stopping the war. What she found, she wrote, was a movement "that often puts personal egos above peace and human life." She said the most devastating conclusion she had reached "was that Casey did indeed die for nothing ... killed by his own country which is beholden to and run by a war machine that even controls what we think." Sheehan told the AP that she had considered leaving the peace movement since last summer while recovering from surgery. She decided on Memorial Day to step down and spend more time with her three other children. She said she was returning to California on Tuesday because it was Casey's birthday. He would have been 28. "We've accomplished as much here as we're going to," Sheehan said, saying she was leaving to change course. "When we come back, it definitely won't be with the peace movement with marches, with rallies and with protests. It will be more humanitarian efforts." Last year, with &#36;52,500 in insurance money she received after her son's death, Sheehan bought five acres near downtown Crawford as a permanent site for protests. "It's for sale," she wrote in the diary. "Anyone want to buy five beautiful acres in Crawford, Texas&#63;" The Mercury News is pleased to let readers post comments about an article at the end of the article.

"This is the first time we are accusing a blue-chip American company of profiting from torture," said ACLU lawyer Ben Wizner, who spoke about the case at a news conference in New York. Since at least 2001, , of San Jose, "has provided direct and substantial services to the United States for its so-called extraordinary rendition' program, enabling the clandestine and forcible transportation of suspects to secret overseas detention facilities where they are placed beyond the reach of the law and subjected to torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment," the suit alleges. A spokesman for Jeppesen said: "There isn't really anything I can say with the exception that I am aware of the suit. We have not been served. I can't talk specifics about any customers that we might have or the services we might provide for them." "Publicly available records demonstrate that Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret rendition flights over a four-year period to countries where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted legal standards," the suit states. Jeppesen provided flight and logistical support services to aircraft and crew used in the rendition program "to unlawfully render plaintiffs to detention and interrogation in , Egypt, and Afghanistan," adds the suit brought on behalf of three men. They are Binyam Mohammed, a British resident who was taken into custody in and is now being held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba; Abou Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen, who was first apprehended in Pakistan and is currently being held in Morocco, and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian citizen, who while seeking asylum in was arrested by Swedish security police, handed over to CIA agents, shackled, drugged, and flown to Cairo from Stockholm, according to the suit. ACLU attorneys, including the organization's executive director, Anthony Romero, said they had obtained information about the rendition program from a variety of sources, including probes in Spain and Sweden and press reports, in particular an article by Jane Mayer in the New Yorker on October 30, portions of which were quoted in the lawsuit. Ms. Mayer wrote that a former Jeppesen employee told her that at a company board meeting a senior Jeppesen official stated: "We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights  you know the torture flights. Let's face it, some of these flights end up that way." The case, filed under the Alien Tort Claims Act of 1789, which enables foreigners to sue in U.S. courts for human-rights violations, is expected to be vigorously fought in court not only by Jeppesen but also by the CIA. The agency was not named as a defendant in the case, but it is possible that the agency will ask a federal judge for permission to intervene and seek to have the case dismissed under the "state-secrets" doctrine. Last March, a federal appeals court in Richmond, , dismissed a case filed by a German citizen who was subjected to extraordinary rendition. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the civil suit filed by Khaled El-Masri could not be reviewed in an American court because of the government's invocation of the "state-secrets" privilege.

The blue chip company has allegedly been involved with the Central Intelligence Agency with âthe forced disappearance, torture and inhumane treatmentâ of three men suspected of being terrorists. According to the suit, âPublicly available records demonstrate that Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret rendition flights over a four-year period to countries where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted legal standardsâ. The three men on behalf of whom the suit was brought includes Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian, who was allegedly mistreated in July 2002 and January 2004; Elkassim Britel, an Italian, who was first apprehended in Pakistan and subjected to torture in May 2002 and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian who, while seeking asylum in Sweden was arrested by Swedish police and handed over to the CIA, underwent torture in December 2001. While Mohamed is currently being held in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Britel is being held in Morocco and Agiza in Egypt. Mike pound, a spokesperson for Jeppesen has said, âThere isn't really anything I can say with the exception that I am aware of the suit. We have not been served. I can't talk specifics about any customers that we might have or the services we might provide for themâ. Boeingâs representative Timothy Neale has commented, âWe have not gotten the lawsuit yet, so we are not commenting on it. We are not confirming the reports that Jeppesen did work for the CIA. The services Jeppesen provides are provided on a confidential basis for all its customers.â The suit alleges that the detainees were taken to countries where they underwent inhumane, degrading treatment and torture since they were beyond the reach of the law. The suit also states that Jeppesen provided services to the flight and crew used in the rendition program âto unlawfully render plaintiffs to detention and interrogation in Morocco, Egypt and Afghanistanâ. The suspects were apprehended under the U.S. government's âextraordinary rendition programâ. Extraordinary rendition is the clandestine capture and transfer of suspects to be detained and interrogated in countries where the protection of U.S. laws does not apply, said Ben Wizner, an ACLU attorney. He also said that âEither they knew or reasonably should have known that they were facilitating a torture program.â The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

Save & Share Article A sheepish Lauer admitted his mistake after "Today" ran the interview, which was conducted Tuesday. "I should have set a better example," he said. Romney also said he needs to keep reminding himself to buckle up. Corzine was riding in a State Police-driven SUV that crashed going 91 mph on April 12 along the Garden State Parkway. Corzine, unbuckled in the front passenger seat, broke his leg, 11 ribs, collarbone and sternum. He voluntarily paid a $46 fine and apologized to the state. He also released a public service announcement urging people to wear seat belts. "Today" show producers noticed the oversight before the segment with Romney aired and decided to have Lauer address it, executive producer Jim Bell said. Viewers certainly noticed. "Today" got more than 100 e-mails about Lauer and Romney's oversights while the segment was being telecast, Bell said. "It was amazing," he said.

Fees to go up WASHINGTON | Beginning July 30, immigrants applying for citizenship or temporary work permits will pay almost twice as much as they do now under a plan unveiled Tuesday by the Bush administration. According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services: &#8226;The application fee for citizenship would rise from $330 to $675. &#8226;The fee to apply for status as a legal permanent resident would increase from $325 to $1,010 for most applicants. Those age 79 and older or under age 14 would pay $930. &#8226;The cost of work permits would rise from $180 to $340. The agency will continue to waive the fees for military members applying for citizenship. GLYNCO, Ga. | Firing back at conservative critics, President Bush defended his plan to overhaul immigration laws Tuesday and accused its opponents of &#8220;trying to rile up people&#8217;s emotions&#8221; with misinformation. In an interview with McClatchy Newspapers and in a speech in Georgia, Bush expressed his determination to fight for changes that would let millions of illegal immigrants gain legal status. He cast the debate as a struggle over the country&#8217;s soul and its reputation as a welcoming nation. &#8220;I&#8217;m deeply concerned about America losing its soul,&#8221; the president said in the interview on Air Force One. &#8220;Immigration has been the lifeblood of a lot of our country&#8217;s history. I am worried that a backlash to newcomers would cause our country to lose its great capacity to assimilate newcomers.&#8221; Bush underscored his commitment to the proposed overhaul, despite harsh criticism from some conservatives. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard some of the talk out there about people defining the bill,&#8221; he told an audience at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco. &#8220;It&#8217;s clear they hadn&#8217;t read the bill. They&#8217;re speculating about what the bill says, and they&#8217;re trying to rile up people&#8217;s emotions. &#8220;If you want to kill the bill, if you don&#8217;t want to do what&#8217;s right for America, you can pick one little aspect out of it, you can use it to frighten people. Or you can show leadership and solve this problem once and for all.&#8221; Bush acknowledged that the proposed overhaul faces a difficult time in Congress, where it is under attack from both ends of the political spectrum. Conservative critics contend that it amounts to an amnesty program because illegal immigrants would be allowed to stay in the country after paying $1,000 fines. Some liberals complain that plans for a new temporary-worker program are overly restrictive and would create a permanent underclass of foreign workers. The bill seeks to strike a balance between tougher border enforcement and a more welcoming policy toward the estimated 12 million immigrants who are already in the country illegally. Bush hopes to push it through Congress with help from a bipartisan group of lawmakers that includes Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Sen. Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican. In the interview, Bush traced his commitment to immigration to his time in Texas. &#8220;When you grow up in Texas like I did, you recognize the decency and humanity of Hispanics,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the truth of the matter is: A lot of this immigration debate is driven as a result of Latinos being in our country. I have seen firsthand the beautiful stories of people being able to take advantage of opportunity and make solid contributions to our society.&#8221; He said that Americans had nothing to fear from large-scale immigration from Latin America. &#8220;There is an element of our society that is worried about two Americas,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our ability to welcome newcomers and the system&#8217;s capacity to assimilate them has been one of the great powerful traditions of America. It works, and it will work this time.&#8221; Fees to go up WASHINGTON | Beginning July 30, immigrants applying for citizenship or temporary work permits will pay almost twice as much as they do now under a plan unveiled Tuesday by the Bush administration. According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services: &#8226;The application fee for citizenship would rise from $330 to $675. &#8226;The fee to apply for status as a legal permanent resident would increase from $325 to $1,010 for most applicants. Those age 79 and older or under age 14 would pay $930. &#8226;The cost of work permits would rise from $180 to $340. The agency will continue to waive the fees for military members applying for citizenship.

Mississippi's rural roots and modern anxieties were on display as the judge and lawyers winnowed the pool to 55 people, from which lawyers hope to pick a dozen to decide whether James Ford Seale, now 71, took part in abducting and killing Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee. The two 19-year-olds were beaten and dumped, still alive, into the Mississippi River. Seale, who has denied membership in the Klan, faces up to life in prison if convicted of kidnapping and conspiracy in the latest of more than a dozen civil rights-era cases that have been prosecuted across the South since the early 1990s. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate is keeping jurors' names a secret at the request of prosecutors who said some might fear to serve in a case involving the Klan. One potential juror from rural southwest Mississippi said one of her cousins is married to one of Seale's cousins. "That makes me nervous, even though I don't know him personally," the woman said nodding toward Seale. Among the 20 other people dismissed from the initial group of 76 potential jurors were a one-armed chicken grower who said he needs to tend to his poultry to pay his bills, and a young woman in a Confederate battle flag T-shirt. Seale, having changed out of his orange jail jumpsuit into khaki pants and a light blue dress shirt, listened quietly in court through wishbone-shaped earphones to amplify the sound because of his hearing problems. When he left, his jail jumpsuit was topped by a bullet-resistant vest. He faces potentially damaging testimony from a man also charged back in 1964. Moore and Dee were hitchhiking May 2, 1964, when carloads of Klansmen were chasing rumors of a possible armed insurrection by black people in the area. The two were driven to the Homochitto National Forest and beaten, then stuffed into a trunk and driven more than 70 miles to the Mississippi River near Vicksburg, according to court records. They were weighted down with engine parts and dumped into the Mississippi, still breathing. Their bodies were found about two months later, when authorities were conducting an intenstive search for slain civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, who disappeared from central Mississippi's Neshoba County on June 21, 1964. Seale and reputed Klansman Charles Marcus Edwards were arrested in 1964 in the deaths of Dee and Moore. But the FBI was consumed by the "Mississippi Burning" investigation of the three civil rights workers, and the Dee-Moore case was turned over to local authorities, who threw out all charges against Seale and Edwards. The Justice Department reopened an investigation in 2000. The FBI closed the case again in 2003 only to reopen it in 2005. Edwards has been granted immunity and is expected to testify for the prosecution. Thomas Moore and two of Dee's sisters &mdash; Thelma Collins, 70, of Springfield, La.; and Mary Nell Byrd, 61, of Natchez, Miss. &mdash; sat near each other in the courtroom Wednesday. The three spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday in Jackson during an interview arranged by Canadian Broadcasting Corp. documentary maker David Ridgen. Since 2005, Ridgen and Thomas Moore have pushed federal officials to reopen the case. Ridgen's film, "Mississippi Cold Case," is to air June 9 on MSNBC. Collins and Moore said they're prepared for any verdict from the jurors. "I just have it in my heart that they're going to do the right thing," Collins said. Moore has already planned what he'll do after the trial, regardless of the outcome. "The last thing that I'm going to do when I leave Mississippi, I'm going to go to that cemetery, that Mount Olive Cemetery. I'm going to tell Charles Moore, 'I told you that I (would) see it to the end.'" (This version CORRECTS the air date of the documentary to June 9, not this Saturday.)

Justice Dept. probes its hirings Investigating for bias toward conservatives By Charlie Savage, Globe Staff | WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department has launched an internal investigation into whether Bush administration officials violated civil service rules by favoring conservative Republicans when hiring lawyers in the Civil Rights Division, the department disclosed yesterday in a letter to Congress. The probe will also examine whether the administration illegally used a political litmus test when vetting candidates for non-partisan positions elsewhere in the Justice Department, according to the heads of the department's offices of inspector general and professional responsibility. The disclosure that the two watchdogs are focusing on the Civil Rights Division marks an expansion to a new arena of the Justice Department of an ongoing investigation into whether politics played a role in the firing of nine US attorneys in 2006. The probe has widened to encompass allegations that the administration has used its control of the Justice Department to gain a partisan edge. "This is to notify you that we have expanded the scope of our investigation to include allegations regarding improper political and other considerations in hiring decisions within the Department of Justice," wrote Inspector General Glenn Fine and Office of Professional Responsibility chief Marshall Jarrett , who are conducting a joint inquiry. Under federal law, officials may not take political affiliation into account when hiring career professionals, permanent, non-partisan employees who stay on when an administration changes. But last week, a former aide to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , Monica Goodling , told Congress that she had "crossed the line" by attempting to block liberal applicants from being hired as career assistant prosecutors and immigration judges. Goodling, a key figure in the US attorney firings who resigned in April, was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony. While it was known that Goodling's hiring practices were under investigation, the letter made clear for the first time that the internal probe has now been extended to hiring by other administration appointees as well. "Among the issues that we intend to investigate are allegations regarding Monica Goodling's and others' actions in DOJ hiring and personnel decisions; allegations concerning hiring for the DOJ Honors Program and Summer Law Intern Program; and allegations concerning hiring practices in the DOJ Civil Rights Division," they wrote. The offices did not disclose whom else they are investigating. Dean Boyd , a Justice spokesman, declined to comment on the probe's expansion. The Honors Program is the main way the department hires professionals who have recently graduated from law school or completed judicial clerkships. For decades, hiring decisions were made by veteran career officials. But in the fall of 2002, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft changed the rules to give political appointees greater control over career hiring. The result was a change in the profile of newly hired professionals, career Justice attorneys say, as non partisan positions were effectively turned into political appointments. In April, a group of Justice officials sent an anonymous letter to Congress alleging that political appointees were systematically screening out applicants who had worked for liberal groups or Democrats, thereby "politicizing the non-political ranks of Justice Department employees, offices which are consistently and methodically being eroded by partisan politics." Current and former career attorneys say that the changes had a particularly dramatic impact on the Civil Rights Division, which is charged with enforcing voting-rights and anti discrimination laws on behalf of minorities. Critics alleged that the administration was seeking to blunt the division's aggressiveness by hiring conservative activists to decide how and when to enforce the laws. Such allegations dovetailed with the resumes of successful applicants to several sections of the Civil Rights Division from 2001 to 2006. The Globe obtained the resumes last year using the Freedom of Information Act. Starting in 2003, after political appointees took greater control of the process, the number of new hires with prior experience in traditional civil rights enforcement plunged. Meanwhile, new hires with strong conservative credentials -- such as membership in the Federalist Society or the Republican National Lawyers Association -- rose significantly, the resumes showed. The political reshaping of the division may have been greater than the resumes show. According to McClatchy Newspapers, Bradley Schlozman , a politically appointed supervisor in the Civil Rights Division from 2003 to 2006, told two applicants in 2005 to delete reference to membership in conservative groups from their resumes and resubmit them. Both were then hired. Schlozman also later became the first replacement US attorney after the firings began in 2006. He served a year without Senate confirmation as the top prosecutor in western Missouri. Schlozman is set to testify before Congress next month. In late April, the Justice Department went back to a system in which career officials will handle most of the hiring for vacancies in the professional ranks and selecting interns, both at the Civil Rights Division and throughout the department. Boyd said the changes were made "to avoid even the perception of any political influence in the process." But former Civil Rights Division lawyers have voiced skepticism about whether the change will make much difference, since many of the career officials who will be making hiring decisions are the same conservative-leaning attorneys who were hired in recent years. Justice officials said that the recent change to hiring rules was prompted by Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty following a December 2006 meeting during which career professionals clashed with McNulty's chief of staff, Michael Elston , over the removal of the names of Democratic-linked candidates from a list of potential interviewees. McNulty announced his resignation earlier this month. The chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, said yesterday that news of the expanded internal probe reinforced their determination to push forward with their own investigation of the Justice Department. "I look forward to the results of the inspector general's investigation," Leahy said. "As Congress continues its oversight into the politicization of the Justice Department, it is abundantly clear that we must do all we can to get to the truth behind this matter and the role the White House played in it." &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

The latest addition to the list is Sylvester Turner, D-Houston -- a well-known figure at the capitol and, at least until Wednesday's filing, an ally of Speaker Tom Craddick, R-Midland. Besides Craddick and Turner, three candidates also ran for speaker at the opening of the 80th Regular Session: Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, Rep. Brian McCall, R-Plano, and Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie. Thompson withdrew her name and endorsed McCall in January -- and then McCall withdrew and endorsed Pitts -- only to see Pitts withdraw his name after a test vote suggested Craddick had the votes to hold onto the chair. Three other Republicans threw their hats in the ring during the end-of-session wrangling over ousting Craddick, including Delwin Jones, R-Lubbock, Fred Hill, R-Dallas, and Jim Keffer, R-Eastland. In total, there are eight candidates for speaker -- an unprecedented number of candidates. Traditionally, candidates for speaker start rounding up 'pledges' from members of the House immediately after the end of the session -- there are 150 representatives -- and many will face bitter primary battles. All must win re-election from their districts. With Turner's entry into the race, the only recognizable truth about the race is that Craddick's support is far from solid, and you can bet that things will change. The next possible speaker's election will occur at the beginning of the next regular or special session. A special session could be called at any time, and the next regular session will begin in January 2009. As a staff member in Rep. Keffer's office said, "It's going to be an interesting 18 or 19 months." (&copy; MMVII, CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.)

http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_6016444&cid El Paso Times - Immigration services fees rise July 30, so file now Immigration services fees rise July 30, so file now By Louie Gilot / El Paso Times Article Launched: 05/30/2007 12:00:00 AM MDT Immigrants have two more months to file for a variety of services, including naturalization, before paying hundreds of dollars in higher processing fees, Citizenship and Immigration Services officials said Tuesday. The agency on Tuesday announced its new fee schedule and the July 30 deadline. Some of the fees will more than double after the deadline. For instance, filing for permanent residency, or a "green card," will cost $1,010, including biometric fees -- the fees for fingerprinting, photographing and capturing the signatures of applicants -- up from $395. Filing for citizenship will cost $675, up from $400. A complete fee list is available at www.uscis.gov. Immigrant advocates expected a rush of immigrant filing petitions in the next two months to avoid the higher fees. Clara Lugo, a permanent resident and a scheduler for a doctor's office in El Paso, said the new fee structure motivated her to file for naturalization after 25 years in the United States. "I've been procrastinating. My family is always telling me so. Even my dad became a citizen already. I've never felt the urge. But this is it. This is my deadline," she said. Overall, the fee increases are not as high as had been proposed earlier, partly because of a review of more than 3,900 public comments, many of which were critical, agency officials said. "We proposed our new fee structure with the expectation of ongoing discussions with the public on this important issue," said CIS Director Emilio Gonzalez in a written statement. "The volume and value of the comments we received has provided an opportunity to fine-tune our final fee structure that we believe is both fair to our customers and vital to our nation as we continue to build a secure and efficient national immigration service." For instance, filing for permanent residency for a child under 14 filing with his family will cost $360 less than proposed. But it will still be $600 per child, in addition to the $1,010 per parent. "I still worry that a lot of people are not going to be able to afford these fees. A lot of people who are eligible for benefits are simply not going to apply. Right now the number one reason for not applying for benefits is the fees," said Iliana Holguin, executive director of the Diocesan Migrant and Refugee Services of El Paso. CIS officials said the fees are needed to improve service at the agency. Officials said that the new revenue would lead to a 20 percent reduction in average application processing times by the end of fiscal year 2009. Forms are now processed by a paper-based system. Part of the additional revenue from higher fees will be used to process applications electronically. Some will continue to be exempt from paying fees: victims of human trafficking, victims of violence against women, refugees, U.S. citizens filing for their immigrant spouses and members of the U.S. military. The biometric fees rise from $70 to $80, as proposed. Louie Gilot may be reached at lgilot@elpasotimes.com, 546-6131.

Seale is charged with kidnapping and conspiracy charges connected to the 1964 slayings of the black teenagers in southwest Mississippi. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis) JACKSON, Miss. - The cold case trial got under way Wednesday in the deaths of two black teenagers who were beaten and dumped still alive into the Mississippi River during the state's dark days of racial brutality. Ku Klux Klansman James Ford Seale faces federal kidnapping and conspiracy charges , along with potentially damaging testimony from a man also charged back in 1964. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate began questioning prospective jurors Wednesday. "We're at the doorstep of justice," said Thomas Moore, the brother of one of the victims, Charles Eddie Moore. For decades, books and news accounts treated the killings of Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee as footnotes in Mississippi's troubled history. They were 19-year-old friends who were hitchhiking on May 2, 1964, near Meadville when carloads of Ku Klux Klansmen were chasing rumors of a possible armed insurrection by black people in the area. Recent court records said the two were driven to the Homochitto National Forest and beaten, then stuffed into a trunk and driven more than 70 miles to the Mississippi River near Vicksburg. They were weighted down with engine parts and dumped, still breathing, into the Mississippi. Their bodies were found about two months later, when authorities were conducting a massive search for slain civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, who disappeared from central Mississippi's Neshoba County on June 21, 1964. Seale and reputed Klansman Charles Marcus Edwards were arrested in 1964 in the deaths of Dee and Moore. But the FBI was consumed by the "Mississippi Burning" investigation of the three civil rights workers and the Dee-Moore case was turned over to local authorities, who threw out all charges against Seale and Edwards. The Justice Department in 2000 reopened an investigation. Edwards has been granted immunity and is expected to testify for the prosecution. Thomas Moore and two of Dee's sisters , Thelma Collins, 70, of Springfield, La.; and Mary Nell Byrd, 61, of Natchez, Miss. , spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday in Jackson during an interview arranged by Canadian Broadcasting Corp. documentary maker David Ridgen. Since 2005, Ridgen and Thomas Moore have pushed federal officials to reopen the case. Ridgen's film, "Mississippi Cold Case," is set to air Saturday night on MSNBC. "I try not to think about it so much because, you know, it's done now," Collins said of her brother's death. "But every time I think about it, I shed a tear." Dee and Charles Moore were not troublemakers, their families say. "My thing is, Charles Moore and Henry Dee wasn't bothering anybody," Thomas Moore said Tuesday. "And for them to be butchered, tormented, hassled and drowned in the river , it was pretty bad." Collins and Moore said they're prepared for any outcome in the Seale trial. "I just have it in my heart that they're going to do the right thing," Collins said. Moore has already planned what he'll do after the trial, regardless of the outcome. "The last thing that I'm going to do when I leave Mississippi, I'm going to go to that cemetery, that Mount Olive Cemetery. I'm going to tell Charles Moore, 'I told you that I (would) see it to the end.'"

An icon to the anti-war left, a lightning rod to many on the conservative right, as well as family members of U.S. troops, Cindy Sheehan has announced her "retirement" from the movement she gave such a public face to. This brings her full circle, back to where this compelling saga first began: Cindy Sheehan, grieving mother. We think that might be just the voice Casey Sheehan's mother is looking for. If that sounds condescending or patronizing to Sheehan, it's not meant to. Any suggestions that the mother of Army Spc. Casey Sheehan, who was 24 when he was killed in an ambush in Baghdad in 2004, should simply have kept her concerns and protests quiet are not only misguided, but, well, un-American. No, Sheehan, formerly of Vacaville, was well within her rights to protest what she saw as the United States making a serious mistake in invading Iraq. And she no doubt takes at least some small comfort from national polls showing most Americans agreeing with the core message of the grass-roots peace movement she helped jump-start. Its infancy came at that makeshift campsite outside President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, where she parked herself for 26 days, demanding the opportunity to discuss her son's death with the president. What she said was her lone, simple question - "Why" - over her son's death ignited a national movement that swelled to thousands of participants. Were it to be kept that simple. Sheehan went from merely being a symbol of the anti-war movement to being its full-time celebrity spokesperson. It was a bumpy road from media darling to activist to shooting duck for pro-military target practice sessions. Was Sheehan smeared, misquoted and unfairly targeted by the right, a victim of what she says were slurs that eventually came from those on the left, as well? Or, with her ill-advised appearances with Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's leftist president, and her reckless rhetoric, filled with increasingly bitter name-calling and careless use of the word "terrorist," did she merely bring it all on herself? The answer likely lies somewhere in the middle. It seemed only fitting that the same traits that marked Sheehan's public persona - sadness and bitterness - were at the heart of her "resignation letter" from the anti-war protest movement, posted in her online diary on the Daily Kos blog. Her frustration at the Democrats' failure - or unwillingness - to get out of Iraq is shared by millions of Americans, but her last posting was all her. "Good-bye America," wrote Sheehan. "You are not the country that I loved ... I finally realized no matter how much I sacrifice, I can't make you be that country unless you want it." With that, the property that Sheehan bought in Crawford for her and fellow protesters - "Camp Casey," she called it - was put up for sale. She's back home in California, where she said she plans to spend more time with her children. The Times-Herald editorial board consists of Publisher Ron Rhea, Editor Ted Vollmer, Managing Editor Jack F.K. Bungart and City Editor Mary Leahy Enbom. She'll do so without her 29-year marriage, which she says she sacrificed to put more energy into stopping the war. And, of course, she'll do so without Casey. Hopefully she'll do it with some peace in her heart. Love her actions or loathe her politics, she's earned that much. Use the comment link provided below to share your thoughts on this story.

Lewis to consolidate soldier memorials | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | News Ft. Lewis to consolidate soldier memorials May 30, 2007 at 8:40 AM PDT May 30, 2007 at 7:39 PM PDT KOMO Staff & News Services FORT LEWIS, Wash. - So many Fort Lewis soldiers are being killed in Iraq the Army base will no longer hold individual memorial services. Starting next month Fort Lewis says it will hold one memorial a month for all the dead soldiers. Nineteen Fort Lewis soldiers have been killed this month -- the most of the war, so far. Fort Lewis acting commander Brigadier General William Troy told staff last week that the number of soldiers in harm's way will preclude individual services. About 10,000 Fort Lewis troops, including two Stryker brigades, are now in Iraq, the most since the 2003 invasion. Some other Army posts have already consolidated services. A memorial service planned for Thursday for one soldier will go on as scheduled at Fort Lewis, and the first consolidated service for four soldiers will be held on June 5. 3 More Fort Lewis Soldiers Killed Meanwhile, the Department of Defense announced Wednesday that three more Fort Lewis soldiers were killed in Iraq in two separate attacks in the past week. Staff Sgt. Thomas M. McFall, 36, of Glendora, Calif., and Cpl. Junior Cedeno Sanchez, 20, of Miami, died Monday when an explosive detonated nearby during a dismounted patrol in Baghdad. Both were assigned to 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, one of two Fort Lewis Stryker brigades serving in Iraq. On Saturday, Pfc. Charles B. Hester, 23, of Cataldo, Idaho, died in Baghdad when his vehicle was hit by a homemade bomb. Hester was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment with the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, Fort Lewis' other Stryker Brigade Combat Team that has been in Iraq since June. Hester had been in the Army three years, joining in May 2004. He arrived at Fort Lewis in September 2004, where he was assigned to the 3rd Brigade. McFall joined the Army in October 1994 and served a year in Korea beginning February 1997. He then reported to Fort Lewis to serve with the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment. In April 2001, McFall was stationed at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and deployed to Afghanistan with the 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment from April 2004 through March 2005. He returned to Fort Lewis that September and had served since January with the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment. Sanchez joined the Army in November 2005 and reported to Fort Lewis last June for assignment to the 4th Brigade's 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry. The unit left for Iraq last month. He was posthumously promoted from the rank of private first class. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free! The latest news video from KOMO.

A Superior Court judge ruled here on Wednesday that the Cuban Parade of could not be prohibited from going through West New York, despite the contention of its mayor that the event did not do enough to recognize the plight of the Cuban people. The decision, by Judge Maurice J. Gallipoli, came two weeks after Mayor Silverio A. Vega of West New York denied a permit to organizers of the eighth annual parade, casting into disarray a festival that sponsors said would attract 350,000 onlookers. After the hearing, the parade&#8217;s founder and chief executive, Emilio Del Valle, said, &#8220;Obviously, I&#8217;m pleased.&#8221; Mr. Vega, who emigrated from when he was 10, had threatened to physically block the parade, which is Sunday, if it tried to come through his town. But he modified that stance on Wednesday. &#8220;I respect the decision of the judge,&#8221; Mr. Vega said after the hearing, adding that although he was not encouraging people to block the parade, they &#8220;might be inclined&#8221; to do so. Mr. Vega&#8217;s lawyer, Daniel E. Horgan, said he was not sure whether his client would appeal. The decision sent organizers scurrying to rearrange the route yet again. The parade typically travels south from North Bergen through Guttenberg, West New York and Union City. But when Mr. Vega denied the permit, organizers decided to limit the parade to Union City, shortening the route by about a mile. After the decision, Mr. Del Valle said he was not sure whether the parade would go through Guttenberg or North Bergen, although Mr. Vega said that according to his reading of the judge&#8217;s orders, it must travel along its original route. Critics of Mr. Vega said that he blocked the parade because he did not want to be seen with Brian P. Stack, the mayor of neighboring Union City, with whom he is engaged in a heated Democratic primary campaign for State Senate. The election will be held two days after the parade. In court, Mr. Horgan contended that the town was right to deny the permit because the organizers were a &#8220;fraud.&#8221; He said the organization, the Latin American Kiwanis Club, had misrepresented itself as a nonprofit group on its application, while operating as a profit-making group. But Elise Di Nardo, a lawyer for Mr. Del Valle, said that the status of the group was irrelevant in denying the permit, and that the issue should be whether the parade posed any &#8220;governmental interest or governmental concern,&#8221; on issues like traffic or crowds. Several times in the hearing, an obviously annoyed Judge Gallipoli referred to the proceedings as &#8220;nonsense,&#8221; saying finally, &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to make sense of nonsense.&#8221; Next Article in New York Region (5 of 24) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

The money is the next test,&#34; said Tom Ingram in a telephone interview yesterday. Mr. Thompson, who won election twice as a Republican senator from Tennessee and appeared in films including The Hunt for Red October , was not immediately available for comment. Mr. Ingram now serves as chief of staff to Senator Lamar Alexander, also a Tennessee Republican. If he decides to seek the U.S. presidency, Mr. Thompson would join a crowded Republican field with no dominant choice. President George W. Bush, prohibited from running for a third term in November 2008, is set to leave office in January 2009. When Mr. Thompson's name is included in public opinion polls with candidates such as former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Senator John McCain of Arizona and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, he ranks among the top candidates along with them. Mr. Thompson, who plays district attorney Arthur Branch in the television show , would not be the first Hollywood actor to gain national prominence in politics if he decides to seek the White House. In 1980, California governor and former B-movie star Ronald Reagan was elected president. More recently, in 2003, Austrian-born bodybuilder and star Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor of California. Ten men are already running for the Republican nomination and former House speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia also is weighing a campaign. Mr. Thompson was first elected to the Senate in 1994 to fill Democrat Al Gore's seat when he became vice-president. Phil G ... LOL!! I hope he runs his presidency in his character from... Reagan was an actor before he was President. It's not... What's next, a President from As the World Turns?

That's right - the grieving mother who morphed into an anti-war icon is exiting the stage. "I have spent every available cent I got from the money a 'grateful' country gave me when they killed my son and every penny that I have received in speaking or book fees since then," Sheehan writes. "I have sacrificed a 29 year marriage and have traveled for extended periods of time away from Casey's brother and sisters and my health has suffered and my hospital bills from last summer (when I almost died) are in collection because I have used all my energy trying to stop this country from slaughtering innocent human beings." She also writes, "The most devastating conclusion that I reached &#91;on Memorial Day morning&#93;, however, was that Casey did indeed die for nothing. His precious lifeblood drained out in a country far away from his family who loves him, killed by his own country which is beholden to and run by a war machine that even controls what we think. I have tried every since he died to make his sacrifice meaningful. Casey died for a country which &#91;sic&#93; cares more about who will be the next American Idol than how many people will be killed in the next few months while Democrats and Republicans play politics with human lives. It is so painful to me to know that I bought into this system for so many years and Casey paid the price for that allegiance. I failed my boy and that hurts the most." In general, any parent who has lost a child in Iraq or Afghanistan deserves the nation's respect and sympathy. The scars from that sort of loss to a family are deep and permanent, to put it simply. But, unfortunately for Cindy Sheehan, being a Gold Star mom doesn't grant her immunity from criticism when she comes off as a self-aggrandizing opportunist or dishonors her son's service. Full disclosure here: Sheehan's efforts have served me personally. She made me realize - for all my frustration and displeasure over the activities of the Bush administration and for all the cutting edge music I've downloaded in recent years - I'm still no liberal. You see, to truly be a liberal in America today you have to cast yourself as an all-caring, all-feeling being while at the same time demonstrating utter disdain for those who dare to hold strong convictions that differ from yours. And that's why she's leaving the arena: For all of her stunts, for all of her happenings, for all of her soundbites, the majority of this nation doesn't agree with her - on anything she says. So she's doing what every good and modern liberal does when things get tough: She's taking her floppy sun hat and going home . . . wherever that is. You see, she lost her husband and her money and nearly her remaining kids . . . but you know that because she told you. And she told you because this joke of a movement she concocted a few years ago is all about her. As her name recognition and star power increased in anti-war circles, she grew into the typical American celebrity: cocky, pompous and self-absorbed. She was the show - a big draw, a headliner. What she said mattered because she said it. Just ask her; she'd tell you. But as with most who attempt to trade on public sentiments, the arc of fame is swift and impartial. Cindy quickly went the way of Andrew Dice Clay. The crowds stopped showing up. The planners stopped asking her to be a headliner. (And she can't appear if she's not the headliner, can she?) She became a parody of herself faster than she could cheer, "What do we want? Peace! When do we want it? Now!" It wasn't her fault. It couldn't have been. After all, she was Cindy Sheehan, rally headliner. Well, read on, Daily Kos readers. It was those damn conservatives and their hate squads and those weak Democrats who were supposed to pull the plug on the war. (Yes, as Sheehan swings at the pinata that is her exit from the public eye, she actually takes aim at the party that made her.) Then in a (hopefully) final act of perceived defiance, she goes from embarrasing to inexcusable. She stains her son's honor once and for all by claiming he died for nothing - a shameless and desperate attempt to one-up her critics. She would sell her son out in death to try and win an argument and in so doing she fades into the sunset as nothing more than a pathetic joke - a wholly unsympathetic character. But there's more. At the end of the requiem of sorts she takes another three pedantic steps back and chucks a Hail Mary of a liberal cliché, writing, "You are not the country that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I sacrifice, I can't make you be that country unless you want it. It's up to you now." Thanks, Cindy; we've got it. If you would have taken the time to stop listening to yourself and push away from the podium at some point in the last three years you would have realized we had it all along. You see, we who differ from your point of view didn't come into our beliefs arbitrarily. We earned them - a concept foreign to most liberals who have more ego than life experiences. And while we're at it, we'll go ahead and preserve Casey's honor in spite of you, honor that is timeless and exists outside of the political spectacle you've attempted to make it. Regardless of how callous you demonstrate yourself to be, those who understand the notion of service over self will never accept the idea that he died for nothing. Sound Off...What do you think?

The loudest jeers were reserved for Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, the amendment&#8217;s most prominent opponent, and seven black or Hispanic council members who abstained from voting. But while the outcome was widely expected, the high-decibel meeting, preceded by a rally on the steps of City Hall, was a stark contrast to the normally subdued process the Council goes through once or twice a year in choosing people to honor with street names. It was also one the most divisive issues to confront Ms. Quinn, the council&#8217;s first openly gay speaker and an ardent supporter of civil rights causes, in her year and half as speaker. At one point, Councilman Charles Barron, a Brooklyn Democrat and a former Black Panther, refused to stop talking after his two-minute comment period. Wagging a finger in Ms. Quinn&#8217;s direction, Mr. Barron said, &#8220;You have divided us more than Sonny Carson ever did.&#8221; For her part, Ms. Quinn said of Mr. Carson, &#8220;He was not an individual who sought to bring our city together.&#8221; Mr. Carson, who died in 2002, was an ex-convict who became a community advocate and antidrug crusader. Some saw him as a community leader, but others saw him as a thug and a bigot. Once asked about charges of being anti-Semitic, he said: &#8220;That&#8217;s absolutely absurd, &#8216;anti-Semitic.&#8217; And so you don&#8217;t ask the question, I&#8217;m antiwhite. Don&#8217;t limit my antis to just one group of people.&#8221; He was convicted in 1974 of kidnapping in a case prosecutors described as a vigilante-style attack that left one person dead and another near death. He was sentenced to seven years in prison. He re-emerged in the 1980s to crusade against drugs and police brutality. &#8220;Sonny Carson got more crack houses closed than the entire Police Department,&#8221; Mr. Barron said during the premeeting rally. In 1990, Mr. Carson led a boycott of Korean-owned delis in black neighborhoods, carrying picket signs that said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t shop with people who don&#8217;t look like us.&#8221; Michael C. Nelson, chairman of the Council&#8217;s Jewish Caucus, recalled the time when Mr. Carson first received national attention as a militant protester during the struggle for community control of public schools. &#8220;Thirty-seven years ago, Sonny Carson walked into my wife&#8217;s classroom and said he didn&#8217;t want any white Jews teaching his children, and he also said he would carve his initials on her chest if she didn&#8217;t leave,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am voting no.&#8221; has said of Mr. Carson that there is probably no one who less deserves a street named after him. Councilman Albert Vann, a Brooklyn Democrat who introduced the amendment, said that whether you agreed or disagreed with Mr. Carson&#8217;s tactics, the community should have the right to decide whom to name streets after. Community Board 3 of Brooklyn had voted in favor of renaming four blocks of Gates Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant to Sonny Abubadika Carson Avenue. Community Board support is required to rename a street, for which Council approval is usually little more than a formality. There were 51 names on the Council&#8217;s list this year, including the actor Jerry Orbach and the modern dance pioneer Alvin Ailey.

Professor William Grays team also kept with the prediction of a 74 percent chance of a major hurricane making landfall on the United States coastline. Hurricane season starts Friday and runs through Nov. 30. Grays team says cooler Pacific Ocean waters near the equator should result in fewer trade winds this year to suppress hurricanes. Its the opposite cycle to the El Nino last year that warmed the Pacific and drove more trade winds to shear apart storms in their early stages. El Nino conditions during the summer and fall, similar to those that developed in 2006, tend to decrease Atlantic hurricane activity by increasing vertical wind shear across the area where Atlantic tropical cyclones develop, Phil Klotzbach of the Colorado State team said in a prepared statement. Only 10 named storms -- five hurricanes and two major hurricanes -- developed last year. The long-term averages over the past 55 years is 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes per year. Earlier this month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it expects 13 to 17 named storms this year, including seven to 10 hurricanes  three to five with winds greater than 110 mph. NOAA anticipates a 75 percent chance of above normal season, a 20 percent chance near normal, and a 5 percent chance below normal season. NOAA officials said most tropical storms and hurricanes should form August through October over the tropical Atlantic Ocean, as is typical for above-normal seasons. Historically, above-normal seasons average two-to-four hurricane landfalls in the continental United States. Also this month, a University of Central Florida statistics professor and his Georgia colleague estimated Brevard County has a 19.4 percent chance of at least 74 mph winds this season, compared with the long-term average of 8.6 percent chance of winds that strong.

The fee increases will take effect July 30. Citizenship fees will rise from $330 to $595, plus $80 for required electronic fingerprints, an increase of $10. For legal permanent residency and fingerprints the cost will be $1,010 for those over 14. The cost now is $325. Officials with Citizenship and Immigration Services, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, said the increases are needed to improve service, hire 1,500 workers, improve offices, equipment and systems to process applications. "This agency is fee based, 99 percent of our budget comes from user fees. We need to be the agency people expect us to be. We need to undertake reforms .... The only way to get from there to here is to have the financial resources to do that," CIS Director Emilio Gonzalez said Tuesday. Many immigration groups and some Democratic members of Congress have protested the fee increases, saying they will put citizenship and legal immigration out of reach of many immigrants. They also question whether better service will follow. The new fees were to be published this week in the Federal Register and also were posted on the CIS Web site.

In his ruling, Judge Maurice J. Gallipoli rejected the argument of attorney Daniel Horgan, representing West New York, that parade organizers were running what amounted to "a charitable fraud" that claimed to use the parade to raise money for scholarships and other charities but actually were running a for-profit enterprise. Parade organizers and others had claimed the permit was denied for political reasons, and implied that Vega took the action to avoid having to walk alongside Union City Mayor Brian Stack in the parade. Vega and Stack are opposing one another for a state Senate seat in next Tuesday's primary. "It's been a tremendous ordeal through a mayor who was a little messed up in the head," Emilio Del Valle, the parade's founder, said after the ruling. Vega did not immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment Wednesday. Attorney Elise DiNardo, representing Del Valle, contended that the denial of the permit amounted to a curtailment of First Amendment rights because it didn't reflect "any governmental purpose or concern" such as crowd control or safety. The parade has passed through West New York since its inception in 2000 and annually draws about 350,000 people. The controversy began two weeks ago when Vega announced he would deny the permit and said he would lie down in front of the marchers to keep them out. The towns of North Bergen and Guttenberg, which the parade also has traditionally passed through, subsequently did not issue permits as they waited for the dispute to be resolved. Attorneys for West New York claimed in court that the Latin American Kiwanis Club, which hosts the parade, was "misusing the Kiwanis name to operate a for-profit, sponsorship operation." The argument didn't sway Gallipoli. "There's a balance to be struck," the judge said. "Let the parade go on and report these people to the appropriate authorities and let them investigate it." Del Valle conceded that the Latin American Kiwanis Club had its charter revoked and would need to pay back dues to have it restored. "They were just doing this now because they have no leg to stand on after what their mayor said," Del Valle said, referring to the charges by Horgan.

Colonialtown / Audubon Park Downtown Orlando / Thornton Park North Orange / Ivanhoe Waterford Lakes / Avalon Park More news on the Web News from other Florida cities NEWS ON YOUR CELL Immigrants face huge fee increases Many say the costs are excessive for people who often are struggling to settle in the U.S. Victor Manuel Ramos | Posted May 30, 2007 Bush defends immigration plan Video: Learn more about the "Z" visa Chart: Immigration fees rising Immigrants applying for the right to live and work in the United States will pay a steeper price starting July 30. The fees that immigrants pay to request "green cards" will nearly triple to $930. The cost of renewing working permits jumps 89 percent to $340. And applying for citizenship will cost $595, an increase of $265. Some children will pay less and immigrants who fall under the federal poverty line can apply for waivers, but most others will have to cough up more cash. Immigration officials, who have hired staff and reallocated resources during the past year to reduce a years-long backlog to about six months, say the increases are necessary because the agency is solely funded by user fees. The increases will raise more than $2 billion, according to immigration officials. But immigrants and their advocates complain that these costs are excessive for people who often are struggling to settle here while helping relatives in their homelands. Under Secretary Emilio Gonzalez, head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, unveiled the fee revisions in January, as the first major overhaul of immigration costs since 1998. The fees will become final after a public-comment period. Gonzalez said in a written statement that the new fees are "both fair to our customers and vital to our Nation as we continue to build a secure and efficient national immigration service." But some say the costs make citizenship less affordable. "This is ridiculous," said Gail Seeram, an Orlando immigration attorney who files applications for many West Indian clients in Central Florida. "These aren't filing fees. These are penalties. . . . If you examine any other government fee structure in the U.S., there is none with such unrealistic set of fees." Since higher fees were proposed earlier this year, many who qualified for citizenship but had not yet requested it rushed to submit their petitions. A recent Orlando Sentinel analysis of filings during the past few months showed that immigrants have filed citizenship applications in record numbers. At least 118,600 immigrants across the country requested citizenship in March, compared with about 74,200 in March 2006. In Florida, the number of citizenship applications was about 31,000 in the first quarter of 2007, an increase of 62 percent over the previous year. Applications for green cards, the documents that entitle immigrants to live and work here legally, also increased in Florida and the U.S. Miriam Vazquez, 37, a Dominican immigrant who works in a factory in east Orlando, was filling out her citizenship application Tuesday because she had heard buzz about the fee increase. Vazquez said that even at the current cost of about $400 for a citizenship application with fingerprinting and photos, she had to save for weeks to scrape the money together. "With the minimum wage we make in this state, it's too little money to pay for all that," Vazquez said. "I am trying to rush and do it now, because it's going to cost more." Richard Logue, who directs the Catholic Immigration and Refugee Services program of Catholic Charities in Orlando, said his office has seen more inquiries from immigrants. Especially burdened, he said, are those who need to file "adjustment of status" forms to request green cards. Those applications will go from $325 to $930, a 186 percent increase. Many who file that application also need to request a work permit, which will jump from $180 to $340 every year. Waivers of those fees, Logue said, are usually difficult to obtain for most immigrants. "Families had a difficult time coming up with the old fees in our experience," Logue said, "so some working-class families will perhaps have to forgo getting their papers and citizenship." Anne Yamasaki, 72, a German immigrant in Rockledge, is dependent on Social Security. She says she can't spare the extra $100 her green-card renewal will cost next year. She won't even think about applying for citizenship, even though she has lived in the U.S. for more than 40 years, because of the cost. But she also wants to see more-efficient service than she did during her last visit to the immigration office in south Orlando. "I live on a very limited income," Yamasaki said. "But it might be worth it, because last time I went to immigration I was standing in a little alleyway for hours." President Bush defends immigration reform.

Judge Maurice J. Gallipoli ruled yesterday that West New York Mayor Salvatore "Sal" Vega did not have a valid reason to deny the parade committee's application to march through West New York. "The parade and the parade committee got more justice in one day than the people in Cuba have gotten in 48 years," said Vega. "That's the difference between the government of our great nation and the government that people struggle with every day in Cuba." In defending his decision to deny the parade access to West New York, Vega had claimed it was wrong to celebrate while Cubans remain oppressed under Fidel Castro. Town attorney Daniel E. Horgan said he does not know if West New York will appeal the judge's decision. The parade in the past had run from Bergenline Avenue in North Bergen, through West New York and ended in Union City. After Vega initially denied the application, organizers had planned for the parade to run from Bergenline at 22nd Street to 48th Street. Now the organizer - Emilio Del Valle and the Latin American Kiwanis Club/Cuban Parade of New Jersey - will have to scramble and get approvals from North Bergen, Guttenberg and West New York. Guttenberg and North Bergen attorneys, who attended yesterday's hearing, said they were waiting for West New York's final decision before issuing permits. Lawyers for West New York claimed in court yesterday the permit was denied because the parade group falsely bills itself as a nonprofit company and called the parade a charitable fraud. Gallipoli said those claims must be brought to the proper agencies for review. "I respect the order of the judge," said Vega. "I will pursue what I consider to be the fraudulent nature of the parade committee through the proper authority as said by the judge, including the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office." Parade co-founder Emilio Del Valle said he will go to work on a new parade route, but it will still begin at 22nd Street in Union City. "(This has been) a tremendous ordeal from a mayor with something wrong in the head," said Del Valle. 32nd District Assembly candidates' profiles 2 teens attacked in Hoboken Announce arrests of 19 Latin Kings &copy; 2007 The Jersey Journal.

(OpenCube Inc. - http://www.opencube.com)**** Suit alleges Jeppesen assisted CIA ACLU says company helped agency fly terrorism suspects to secret jails Use your sleuthing skills to post an opinion on By Chris Walsh, Rocky Mountain News A lawsuit filed Wednesday alleges that Arapahoe County-based Jeppesen knowingly helped the Central Intelligence Agency fly terrorism suspects overseas to secret jails where the prisoners were tortured. The American Civil Liberties Union claims Jeppesen, a 73-year-old company that offers a host of flight-planning and navigation services, provided support to at least 15 aircraft that made 70 flights to clandestine locations since December 2001. During those flights, suspects allegedly were stripped, blindfolded, chained down - one even made to wear a diaper. The ACLU says the suspects were tortured and subjected to other forms "of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment" at overseas locations under the CIA's so-called extraordinary rendition program. Officials at Jeppesen, a subsidiary of Boeing Co., had no immediate comment. The company, though, stressed that it doesn't provide flights and knows little about its clients' intentions. "We have thousands of customers who do tens of thousands of flights a day that we'll support with information in some fashion," said company spokesman Mike Pound. "There are some things we have to know, such as what route the airplane is going to take. But it isn't necessary to know why somebody is making a trip, and it is not our practice to ask." The Jeppesen name is familiar to many locals: Denver International Airport's main terminal is named after Elrey Jeppesen, who founded the company and was inducted into the Colorado Business Hall of Fame. The company provides everything from flight charts and weather data to training and software. It employs 1,400 in Colorado and has offices worldwide. Jeppesen has been linked to the covert CIA flights before. In 2006, an article in claimed Jeppesen regularly arranges CIA "spook" flights to overseas locations. The magazine quoted a former worker who said a top-level executive admitted that the company participates in the flights. Since then, peace activists and others have protested outside the company's offices in San Jose, Calif., home of Jeppesen's International Trip and Flight Planning Office, which is said to have organized the flights. ACLU attorney Ben Wizner said Jeppesen could not have been ignorant of the purpose of CIA flights. "Either they knew or reasonably should have known that they were facilitating a torture program," he said. Companies "are not allowed to have their head in the sand and take money from the CIA to fly people, hooded and shackled, to foreign countries to be tortured." The lawsuit says Jeppesen participated in everything from providing aircraft crew with weather, route information and hotel accommodations to facilitating customs clearance and securing landing permits from foreign governments. Jeppesen's parent, Chicago-based Boeing, is not named in the lawsuit. Boeing spokesman Tim Neale said company officials typically don't comment on lawsuits and had not seen this one, nor would they confirm the allegations that Jeppesen provided services to the CIA. "Jeppesen has a confidentiality clause with all its customers," he said. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District, does not name the CIA as a defendant. The Bush administration has insisted it receives guarantees of no torture from countries receiving terror suspects. Ralph Latimer persuaded the Denver City Council to name Denver International Airport's terminal after aviation legend Elrey Borge Jeppesen, who moved to the city in 1941 and was here until his death in 1996. Capt. Jeppesen was the first person to exit the first plane to land at DIA on the airport's opening day- Feb. 28, 1995. or 303-954-2744. Rocky wire services contributed to this report.

Most recent post in SLY N' CHIC PREMIER ISSUE &hellip; reader to stay up to date with the latest news and posts from Gothamist. Sonny Carson Battle in City Council Things got heated in the City Council yesterday as former Black Panther and Council Member Charles Barron against Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who had removed the name of Sonny Carson from a list of people to be honored with having streets named after them. Sonny Carson was an activist who railed against Korean grocers and, not wanting to limit himself to an accusation of anti-Semitism, said he was anti-white in general. Quinn feels that Carson was a divisive figure in New York's history and Barron thinks he was an important individual who united his community. Earlier this week Barron and a state Asemmblyman from Brooklyn Linden Park in Brooklyn "Sonny Abubadika Carson Park" despite the Parks Department's insistence that no such name change was going to be recognized. Barron said "This is official, because I am an official" and Mayor Bloomberg was quoted saying naming anything after Sonny Carson was one of the worst ideas in recent history. The Parks Department said that it would remove the signs that Barron had affixed around Linden Park and the Council Member promised to just keep putting more up. The bizarre park incident was the precursor to yesterday's Council event, which included a vote to amend the bill by re-adding Carson's name to the list of proposed street names. The event was not amicable, as the amendment failed 25-15 in the 51 member body. Barron's aide Viola Plummer heckled Quinn during the meeting and later vowed to end the career of Leroy Comrie, a black council member who abstained from voting on the amendment, using the term "assassinate him". No black council members voted against the amendment. It sounds like a racially acrimonious meeting and NY1 thinks that it could eventually injure Quinn's aspirations for higher office. (Photo of Charles Barron by Bebeto Matthews/AP) Advertisement: Gothamist Continues Below! Absolutely ridiculous. Let's honor racism by giving it a street name... Good for Quinn and the rest of the Council Members who have brains. Posted by: mcscatterbomb | AM Democracy may be the best form of government, but occasionally it fails - for example, when a moron like Barron is able to win an election. Posted by: Peter | AM Never Again, Now you will see. God bless you Charles Barron. This is only the beginning. Never again always forever. Posted by: never again always forever | AM "but occasionally it fails - for example, when a moron like Barron is able to win an election." I don't think it failed. The people have elected him. That's democracy. The fact that his constituents are racists is a different matter. Posted by: Stan LS | AM "never again always forever", could you please explain that? "Never Again" is most often associated with the Holocaust and seeing how Sonny Carson was "Anti White", I'm not making the connection... AM S.D. - Don't forget that he was Anti-Jewish and Anti-Korean too! Posted by: Jon | AM While Carson put his stance in ethnically-charged and prejudicial terms, the basic idea was "buy black," which is and always has been a legitimate form of economic activism for the black community. Before desegregation, we blacks largely patronized businesses owned and operated by other blacks because we had to; once we stopped having to, many of those businesses died, along with a sizable portion of our middle class. Black people are dying and dying out in this country -- economically, who's to blame for that? And don't start with that "well if you didn't buy sneakers instead of putting in the bank" bullshit. Posted by: matukonyc | AM Without disputing your facts about post-desegregation businesses, are you contending that segregation was actually good for blacks? I don't know who is to blame for why blacks are not doing as well economically but I have a hard time believing that it is due to desegregation. Posted by: tim | AM "who's to blame for that?" Blame the culture. Teenage pregnancies, children out of wedlock, lack of discipline, etc. I went to a public high school in brooklyn and the difference between american born blacks and that of recent carribean immigrants is pretty noticable. They acdtually respected the teachers, cared about their grades, etc. Posted by: Stan LS | AM It's Our Time now, Never Again Always Forever, look it up. Posted by: nevr again our time | AM Does the City Council have any kind of impeachment option? Posted by: Brightliner | AM let the people who use the park name it after whoever they want. Are Quin, Bloomberg or anyone who doesnt live in the immediate area actually going to visit it. No. Barron, like any other race baiter, wins the more the establishment complains about this non issue. Posted by: jb | AM Let's rename Atlantic Ave "Tookie Williams Boulevard." Posted by: DarnellRobinson | AM If you think teen pregnancy, lack of discipline, unwed mothers etc is only exclusive to one group, I have a bridge to sell you. Visit a WalMart below the mason dixon/washington beltway or west of Trenton and you'll see. You don't even have to go that far, there's these people everywhere, from Seldon LI to areas of trash in Rhode Island and Boston. Posted by: breakfast clubber | AM "If you think...", nice strawman, there. To me, people who live in projects are the same type of people who live in mobile homes. Posted by: Stan LS | AM one salient point to make about out of wedlock births is that the percentages for black and white women are not only radically difference, but the result is disproportionately heavy on black children (48% in poverty versus 11% for whites). this story touches on this: wanted to inject a factoid or two; enjoy the trolling! Never Again Always Forever sounds like a mountain dew slogan gone bad. Posted by: dhex | AM It's sad what the "civil rights" movement has devolved into. Sadder still that people like Barron make people like Sharpton seem almost professional by comparison. Posted by: Frog | AM breakfast clubber, I hate to actually bring, well, facts, into this debate, but the teen pregnancy rate among African Americans in New York State is more than 3x that of whites. Check out teenpregnancy dot org. Posted by: JustAGuy | AM If you say so. that's not what you wrote. your kids are healthy, right? Good. You love and teach them well. Posted by: skarekrow | AM Also, 2/3 of births to african-american women in NY in 2004 were out of wedlock, while only 20% of births to white women were. per cdc dot gov. Posted by: JustAGuy | AM I don't think it failed. The people have elected him. That's democracy. The fact that his constituents are racists is a different matter. You are quite correct. Democracy did not fail - it produced a bad result, but that is not the same thing as failure. Posted by: Peter | AM frog, you may be missing the point of barron and sharpton, etc. they serve a niche that exists because of the accidents and incidents of history, just like any other politico. their rhetoric just happens to be sharper. they're also drawing on a historical current that goes back, at least in new york, to the days of marcus garvey before the great splintering. that's a hell of a long time. one of those splinters, btw, became the various "lost tribes" groups, one variation you can still see in times square. i recommend listening for a while because it is a fascinating peek into a culture which has retained physiological presumptions about race that date back to the end of the high water mark for eugenics in the united states. Posted by: dhex | AM a poster mentioned the unwed births by race, that's the entire country. show me where is it that black teens are having more births out of wedlock for the entire U.S.? ever been to West Virginia? take a drive through there on your way to chicago. Or, maybe it's just the white girls who just throw their just born baby in the dumpster before going to the prom, look that up. Posted by: nyc the capital of the world | PM Barron is ridiculous.

The anger over Republican House Speaker Tom Craddicks treatment of House rules has been brewing for some time. Early Monday morning, nearly 60 lawmakers walked out of the chamber after Craddick refused to allow a vote on whether he should remain the speaker. The walkout broke a quorum and forced the House to adjourn. This man is sitting here violating every rule of the House, every rule of parliamentary procedure to keep himself in office, and its wrong, said Rep. Pat Haggerty, R-El Paso. House Democratic leader Jim Dunnam of Waco said, Weve had enough. This was not the first objection to Craddicks leadership. In January, he won a challenge by fellow Republican Jim Pitts of Waxahachie. Alexis DeLee, a spokeswoman for Mr. Craddick, released a written statement criticizing the walkout as politics. Once again, some members chose to divert the House away from important matters and instead tried to drag the members into a speakers race while we are in session. The 140-day legislative session is scheduled through the end of the day on Monday. It appeared the Speaker had held onto his position as members returned to the chamber, after an appeal by Governor Perry to rise above their differences and finish the work of the people of Texas. Craddicks two-year term does not expire until the next legislative session convenes, in January 2009. Already, five Republicans have said they will be running against him. Whomever the next speaker turns out to be, they will most likely find that the House rules have been rewritten. Burt Solomons, the Chairman of the Financial Institution, and the person who carried House rules through its ratification in January, said it was never the intent of the rules to give the speaker absolute authority. He promised that the rules would be revised so that the next speaker would not be able to claim the amount of power Craddick has. Information from the Associated Press, Reuters, and the Dallas Morning News was used in this report. on May 28 2007 18:15:21 on May 28 2007 21:09:45 I am amused by this story, since the Republicans want to remove their own Speaker. I wonder, if it is not one man&#39;s failure to lead or indicative of other problems. Please Login to Post a Comment. Rating is available to Members only. Please login or register to vote.

View 7 days > Thursday, past must be faced - and recognized for how recent it is Twenty-five years ago, someone near and dear to me disappeared. Was he a victim of foul play? Did he bump his head and lose all memory? Or did he just decide to pursue new beginnings somewhere else, unburdened by a wife and a family? After a quarter of a century, I'm beginning to accept that I will never know what happened. Still, the last thing I want is for someone to say, "Forget about it. Move on!" I've moved on. But forget? Never. Most people, when someone close disappears or dies mysteriously, never get over it. Thomas Moore never got over his brother's murder in Mississippi in 1964, and he never stopped hoping that justice would rain down on those responsible. Earlier this year, James Ford Seale, 71, a Klansman, was indicted on federal kidnapping and conspiracy charges in connection with the murders of Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee. According to the FBI, the two 19-year-olds were hitchhiking in Mississippi when Klansmen picked them up and took them to the Homochitto National Forest. They were severely beaten, dumped into the trunk of a car and driven to Louisiana, where they were weighted down, thrown into the Mississippi River and left to drown. Seale was first arrested in November 1964, but the charges were eventually dropped, and the two young men's deaths were all but forgotten. "We didn't have money to solicit help from attorneys, so the old saying is, we just had to eat it up," Thomas Moore said in Kathy Lohr's "Morning Edition" report on National Public Radio this week. But while the taste of what Moore's family had to "eat" is bitter, he has gotten relief that others similarly positioned never have. He's lived to see this week the selection of jurors who may finally bring a scoundrel to justice. This case is one of many investigations reopened in the so-called Civil Rights Era Cold Case Initiative in which the U.S. Justice Department, modern Southern prosecutors and civil rights organizations are working together. The Southern Poverty Law Center, in fact, has compiled a list of more than 70 men and women who died between 1952 and 1968 "under circumstances suggesting they were the victims of racially motivated violence." The victims were tortured and killed in a variety of ways; they were shot, burned alive, hanged, beaten, strangled, castrated, mutilated, drowned or denied needed medical treatment. A civil rights activist recently remarked that with white supremacy being "the " in Mississippi, "to some people it was just sport to go out and harass and kill black people." Timothy B. Tyson, a white Southerner, would agree. Blood Done Sign My Name , the winner of this year's University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Religion wrote, "I don't know when I first became infected with white supremacy. But when I was no more than 6 years old, I discovered within myself both that monstrous lie and the moral cowardice necessary to its preservation." Ancient history? Hardly. Tyson was born in 1959. His book was inspired by the 1970 murder of Henry Marrow, a 23-year-old black veteran who was "killed in public as he lay on his back, helpless, begging for his life." And what burned Marrow's murder into Tyson's consciousness was a childhood friend saying to him, "Daddy and Roger and 'em shot 'em a nigger." "Many individuals have quite literally gotten away with murder," FBI Director Robert Mueller III has said. He warned those still alive, however, "We're still on your trail." This is a badly needed response to the people who live in what I call the honky-dory nation -- that place where everything is cool, where talk about unpleasant things simply is not allowed and where people say that no good comes from opening old wounds. All that comes from sweeping unpleasant incidents under the rug is a lumpy rug. Facing up to the past, including the bad, is the only way individuals and nations can heal. Betty Winston Bayé's columns appear Thursdays. Her e-mail address is I wasn't even born in 1960. What I see today FOR THE MOST PART is black and white people coexisting fairly and FOR THE MOST PART treating each other with respect. The last business dealing I had was with a mixed couple. That doesn't make for exciting journalism, though, does it? You can keep dwelling and bemoaning the items of injustice (for which this writer or your readers are not responsible) or you can realize it was a different time in this nation and be happy how far we have come in 45 years. How much more progress will come in the future? Do you want to be a part of that? Or, do you want to provide a reason for otherwise harmonious casual and personal relationships to feel strain because of something long ago we can't do anything about and had nothing to do with? Your paycheck must be more important than progress. Posted: Thu am Subscribe to the newspaper Copyright 2005 The Courier-Journal.

Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Thursday, on Thu, May. 31, 2007 Justice is widening its probe to other hirings WASHINGTON - An internal Justice Department investigation into the firing of eight federal prosecutors has broadened to examine whether the department used political considerations in hiring career employees for its Civil Rights Division. Glenn Fine, the department&#0039;s inspector general, and H. Marshall Jarrett, head of the Office of Professional Responsibility, told the House and Senate Judiciary Committees in a letter yesterday that the review also would focus on hiring for the department&#0039;s honors program for entry-level attorneys and on summer internships. The expansion followed the May 23 acknowledgment by the department&#0039;s former White House liaison, Monica Goodling, that she had "crossed the line" by inquiring into the party affiliations of people applying for nonpolitical jobs. Fine and Jarrett said they were looking at "allegations regarding Goodling&#0039;s and others&#0039; actions" in hiring and personnel decisions. The Justice Department began investigating in March to assess whether the U.S. attorneys had been fired for improper reasons, such as a way to meddle in cases, and whether department officials had misled Congress when testifying. Both Judiciary Committees are also probing the firings and the White House&#0039;s role in them. On May 2, the Justice Department disclosed that investigators also would probe whether Goodling had relied on improper political considerations in reviewing the applications of people seeking to become assistant U.S. attorneys. Last year&#0039;s firings touched off a political furor over Attorney General Alberto Gonzales&#0039; management of the department and his close ties to President Bush. Many Democrats and several Republicans have called for Gonzales&#0039; ouster, although Bush has repeatedly expressed support for him. Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D., Vt.) said in a statement that he welcomed the expanded review. Goodling, who quit in April, told the House Judiciary Committee under a grant of limited immunity that she sometimes considered lawyers&#0039; political views when reviewing them for positions as immigration judges or assistant U.S. attorneys. Both jobs are covered by civil-service laws barring such assessments.

Lindsay Caruso was shopping at a health food store on Broadway when she saw a commotion in front of Broadway Grill and walked over to check it out. At 11 a.m., both women were stationed in front of the restaurant, along with their babies, waiting to get a glimpse of former New York mayor and Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani, who was scheduled to show up at any minute. By that time, owner Nick Bovis had been at the restaurant for about an hour. He stopped by the table of "New York" Nick Fleres, a general contractor who eats at the grill four or five times a week, and told him to leave the seat next to him open, because Giuliani might be taking it. Bovis had first heard from Giuliani's campaign late last week. A campaign manager called and told him that Giuliani was "looking for a place he could come and meet regular people" before heading to a fundraiser at the Burlingame Hyatt, Bovis said. Campaign operatives in the Bay Area recommended the grill, which opened in December, in part because of its New York-centered theme and decor, said Giuliani spokesman Jarrod Agen. As 11 o'clock neared, Bovis positioned himself near the front door. By his feet was a framed, autographed photo of famed New York Yankee slugger Joe DiMaggio that he planned to present to Giuliani, a devoted Yankees fan. Bovis, who also owns Lefty O'Doul's in San Francisco,laughed and said he doesn't know much about politics, but Giuliani struck him as a "common-sense, middle-of-the-road" candidate. "If he can clean up New York, he can clean up the United States," he added. Giuliani stepped out of his car shortly after 11 a.m. and onto the Broadway sidewalk, where he was accosted by a scrum of reporters and cameramen. He assured them he'd speak to them after the event and made his way to the door, where Bovis greeted him. Bovis showed him the photo of DiMaggio once they were inside. "Oh, look at that!" Giuliani said, smiling and clapping his hands together. "It's beautiful. Thank you." Giuliani then made his way around the restaurant, shaking hands and signing autographs. Eventually, the candidate took a seat next to Fleres and several other customers at a table in the middle of the room, toasting them with a glass of orange juice. They talked about baseball, taxes, health care and children, Flores recalled afterward. "I think he's genuine," said Fleres, who grew up in New York City's Greenwich Village neighborhood. "He looks at you when he speaks (and he's) very bright and very poised." Giuliani supporters at the Grill said the mayor made a strong and favorable impression on them in the wake of the World Trade Center attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. "There's a safety about him," said Ana Cisneros, one of the managers of the restaurant, who was working as a United Airlines flight attendant on 9/11. "Something about him is just warm and genuine." Carlos Alferez, a pastor from San Jose who drove up for breakfast at Bovis' invitation, said he was eager to learn more about the candidate. "The most that I know about him is after the 9/11 (attacks) he really held the city together," said Alferez, seated across from his wife, Maxine. "And the people there really respected him." As Giuliani walked out of the grill, Borrolaza and Caruso positioned themselves along the sidewalk, hoping for an introduction. But the candidate was distracted by a well-wisher to his right and went by without seeing them. Giuliani took questions from reporters on the corner of Broadway and Capuchino Avenue, then turned around to find his car. This time the two mothers got his attention. He shook Borrolaza's hand, though he didn't notice 11-month-old Kasen, and moved on to Caruso, who held her 3-month-old son, Daniel, out for him to greet. "Of course I'll say hi to your kid," said Giuliani, bending down to give the child a kiss on the forehead. "Well, at least I got to shake his hand," said Borroloza after the Republican front-runner had gotten into his car. "Baby didn't get kissed, but he won't remember." "Danny, Danny!" Caruso explained to her son. "You got kissed by Mayor Giuliani!" Staff writer Aaron Kinney can be reached at (650) 348-4302 or Comment on this article by clicking on the link below.

"I think the way a Republican should run is toward the future," the former New York City mayor told reporters at the Broadway Grill, where he signed autographs and chatted it up with customers. He criticized Clinton's proposal - which she pitched Tuesday in New Hampshire - to let President Bush's tax cuts for top earners expire. He supports eliminating the estate tax and reducing the capital gains tax. Playing to his audience, Giuliani said higher taxes would mean less venture capital for the high-technology industries that keep the Bay Area's economy afloat. There's "a dramatic difference ... between a philosophy of more government" espoused by Clinton and Democrat Barack Obama and his own support for "lower taxes, less government Giuliani then headed to a birthday-celebration fundraiser, heavy with Silicon Valley venture capitalists and corporate executives, at the Burlingame Hyatt. Tickets cost up to &#36;2,300, with the top price bringing a VIP reception and photo op with the candidate. From there, he was heading to a similar event in Beverly Hills. Nick Bovis, the owner of the downtown Burlingame eatery, presented Giuliani with an autographed photo of New York Yankee legend Joe DiMaggio. "We want you to redecorate the White House," Bovis told him. He signed a copy of the U.S. Constitution for local campaign coordinator Vic Marani, 47, of Santa Cruz, and accepted a &#36;200 campaign contribution check from George Yerby, 67, of Hillsborough; Giuliani quipped it might have been "the first time I think one's been given directly to me." Yerby, who said he's semi-retired from real estate, said Giuliani's policies are "perfect for this area. ... He's going to be the next president." After a slow circuit of the restaurant, Giuliani, with a cup of coffee in hand, took a seat between regulars Mike DeMaria and Nicholas Fleres, both of whom described themselves as "New York Italians." The conversation ranged from the Yankees to California's early primary to immigration policy. On the latter, Giuliani said he doesn't support the plan drawn up by the Senate and Bush, in part because it doesn't include issuing tamper-proof ID cards or require a database of all foreigners entering and leaving the country. Bob Mayer, 56, a self-employed wholesaler from Millbrae, said he supports Giuliani for precisely this reason. "It's not a time to quibble over abortion or to quibble about gay marriage," Mayer said. Immigration, border security and homeland security are paramount, he said. "Everything else is just window-dressing." On the way to his waiting car, Giuliani kissed the forehead of 11-month-old Daniel Caruso of Burlingame, whose mother, Lindsay Caruso, 30, said they had been out for a walk and stopped to see what all the hubbub was about. "I don't know a ton about him at this point," she said of Giuliani. "But I'm interested, definitely, and learning more." Contact Josh Richman at jrichman@angnewspapers.com or (510) 208-6428.

Thursday, &mdash; The Justice Department said Wednesday that it has expanded its internal inquiry on the firing of U.S. attorneys into whether politics played a part in hiring career prosecutors. In a rare note updating lawmakers on its investigation, the department said it also was looking into hiring practices within its civil rights division. Lawmakers have questioned whether the division has hired prosecutors with strong political r&eacute;sum&eacute;s but little civil rights experience. Ex-White House aide admits considering applicants' politics. Man gets 21 months in wreck that killed Leander firefighter 13 people may have contracted whooping cough from Seton employee Beach balls and chanting are no-no's in Dripping Springs, principal says Woman arrested in April shooting death of Mexican immigrant Couple's home is a natural getaway The letter to the leaders of House and Senate Judiciary committees comes a week after the department's former White House aide, Monica Goodling, admitted that she "crossed the line" in considering job applicants' loyalty to the Republican Party before approving their employment. Doing so is illegal. The short letter, signed by Justice Inspector General Glenn Fine and Office of Professional Responsibility counsel H. Marshall Jarrett, widens the inquiry into hiring practices in at least three areas, including: &#8226;Those by Goodling and other Justice officials. &#8226;The Civil Rights division. &#8226;The department's honors programs and summer law intern positions. Critics say the honors program, which has long been filled with graduates of prestigious law schools, has been opened to applicants with mostly political credentials. Justice officials say the applicants are all reviewed by an outside committee before they are hired by the deputy attorney general's office. Democrats Patrick Leahy of Vermont and John Conyers of Michigan, chairmen of the Senate and House panels, respectively, said the allegations show the need for greater oversight at the Justice Department. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called anew for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign. "As long as Mr. Gonzales remains attorney general, no internal probe is going to clear the air," Schumer said. View All Top Jobs A member of the Real Cities Network. Subscribe to the Newspaper .

He described his proposal, which has been accepted by a bipartisan group of senators, as one that makes it more likely we can enforce our border and at the same time uphold the great immigrant tradition of the United States of America. Bush spoke at the nations largest training centre for law enforcement. He chose the get-tough setting as a counter to conservative critics ferocious denunciation of a Senate proposal as being soft on people who break the law. Hoping to blunt that message, Bush emphasised that any new options for immigrants and foreign workers would not start until tougher security is in place. The presidential stop came during a congressional recess, with senators back home and facing pressure from both left and right on the immigration plan. © Thomas Crosbie Media 2007.

Bush takes aim at GOP critics of immigration deal Says conservatives use scare tactics, 'haven't read bill' President Bush's trip to Georgia opened a campaign intended to undercut the criticism that has consumed conservative talk shows and Internet sites, and educate the public. (Oscar Sosa/Bloomberg News) By Peter Baker, Washington Post | GLYNCO, Ga. -- President Bush lashed out at critics within his own party yesterday, accusing Republican opponents of distorting the immigration deal he negotiated with leading congressional Democrats and playing on the politics of fear to undermine public support. In harsh tones normally reserved for the liberal opposition, Bush said conservatives fighting the immigration proposal "haven't read the bill" and oppose it in some cases because "it might make somebody else look good." Their "empty political rhetoric," he said, threatens to thwart what he called the last, best chance to fix an immigration system that all sides agree is broken. "If you want to kill the bill, if you don't want to do what's right for America, you can pick out one little aspect out of it," he told thousands of trainees at a federal center here that prepares Border Patrol officers. "You can use it to frighten people. Or you can show leadership and solve this problem once and for all, so the people who wear the uniform in this crowd can do the job we expect them to do." The president's rhetoric underscored the bitter crossfire among Republicans over immigration and the enormous challenge Bush faces in trying to rally his party behind what may be the most significant domestic initiative left in his presidency. The White House has been pressing conservatives to fall in line, sending emissaries to meet with lawmakers and activists, but many on Capitol Hill and on the presidential campaign trail have ignored the administration's pleadings and rushed to denounce the deal. Although the proposal has the support of key Democrats, most notably Senator Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, the White House recognizes that its chances of pushing it through depend on winning enough Republican support. Bush's trip to Georgia opened a campaign intended to undercut the criticism that has consumed conservative talk shows and Internet sites, and educate the public about a complicated bill. But conservatives bristled at his remarks. "I don't think name-calling does any good at this point," said David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union. "What they've done from the very beginning is say, `This is the way we want it done and anyone who disagrees with us is outside the mainstream.' . . . It's been badly handled. They'll be lucky, given the attitudes in the country, to come up with anything." Brian Darling, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said he and his colleagues not only have read the bill but posted it on the think tank's website . "Most conservatives have very strong feelings that this bill contains amnesty . . . and no yelling and screaming by the administration is going to change our minds," he said. As for the charge of scare tactics, Darling said: "Honestly, I really think people should be frightened. This bill would be the most dramatic change to immigration law in 40 years and no one seems to understand what's in the bill. . . . The American people should be frightened by the closed-door process that was used and by the ramifications." The proposal would beef up enforcement with thousands more Border Patrol agents and hundreds of miles of more fencing along the line with Mexico. After that has been accomplished, in an estimated 18 months, the legislation would introduce a guest-worker program, allowing some immigrants into the country temporarily, and create a process providing many of the 12 million illegal immigrants already here a chance to earn legal residency if they pay back taxes and penalties, pass criminal background checks, and return first to their country of origin. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Pu, an eighth-grader from Auburn, was No. 277 of 286 spellers in this year's bee, which forced him to wait on stage for 45 minutes during Round 2 and nearly two hours for round three while others faced the ultimate challenge in spelling. Pu made it to the third round Wednesday but tripped on the word "rambla," which means dry ravine. Pu, who admitted he wasn't familiar with the word, spelled it "rombla." The disappointing end was in direct contrast to his strong and confident performance earlier in the day. Despite waiting for nearly 100 spellers to finish in round two, Pu didn't waste any time when his name was called. He stepped to the microphone. He heard the word, asked for a definition then barely hesitated before correctly spelling "shindig." The success pushed him through to the third round of the nation's premier -- and most difficult -- spelling competition and a step closer to a grand prize of $35,000 cash, a $5,000 scholarship, a $2,500 savings bond and a complete set of reference works. He was in the third round with 106 other spellers, along with much tougher words and immense pressure. All 107 qualified by scoring high enough on a 25-word written test and spelling a word to a large audience. Pu admitted the wait was tough. "It's true. Because you're waiting for your turn and you don't really pay much attention to the other people, and then when it's your turn, you get really nervous," said Pu, who attends Federal Way Public Academy. He was sponsored by the Seattle P-I. In past years, spellers from Washington state have grown apprehensive as they watch competitors spell easy words. The fear, they have said, is that the quota of manageable words will end, leaving them with brutally difficult words. Pu had no such thoughts: "I like to think optimistically." Pu wasn't the only one who breezed through the early rounds only to fall in round three. The round eliminated 13 of the 107 who began. With more free time than expected, Pu said he will watch the bee, go sightseeing in Washington, D.C., and concentrate on one other goal. "I want to convince my sister to start spelling," he said. The oral round was hardly taxing for the top spellers. Tia Thomas, 12, of Coarsegold, Calif., back for her fourth national bee, correctly spelled "flagrant." The audience laughed when pronouncer Jacques Bailly defined "ninety" as "being one more than 89" for 13-year-old Mary Harrington of Vineyard Haven, Mass. Aishwarya Pastapur of Overland Park, Kan., made her feelings known by wearing a T-shirt with the words "mishpelt werds eeritate me." She displayed no irritation whatsoever when correctly spelling "enumerated." Kate Weir, 13, of Christchurch, New Zealand, traveled far to participate, and she must have thought the wait was even longer when she was kept at the microphone while the judges conferred over her Kiwi-accented spelling of "eeriness." Her spelling was eventually declared correct. The bee concludes Thursday night with the champion being crowned during a prime-time broadcast.

He was assigned to the 2-6 Calvary Squadron at Schofield Barracks. AP Photo/The Norwich Bulletin Chief Warrant Officer Theodore U. Church, 32, of Ohio, was also killed in Monday's crash in Iraq. He was also based at Schofield. Two soldiers who were assigned to the 2-6 Calvary Squadron at Schofield Barracks were among the 10 soldiers killed in Iraq on Memorial Day, the Department of Defense announced today. 1st Lt. Keith N. Heidtman, 24, of Norwich, Conn., and Chief Warrant Officer Theodore U. Church, 32, of Ohio, died Monday in Muqdadiyah, Iraq, when their OH-58D Kiowa helicopter crashed after receiving heavy enemy fire during combat operations, the DOD said. They were assigned to the 2nd Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, 25th Combat Aviation Brigade, 25th Infantry Division. Heidtman was the 37th military member with Connecticut ties to die since the war began in 2002. Two Connecticut civilians have also been killed. "It's all a shock to us," said Chris Heidtman, the soldier's uncle. His parents were notified Tuesday morning. He was the son of Kerry Heidtman and Maureen Robidoux. His stepfather is Art Robidoux. A Norwich Bulletin article quoted Heidtman's stepfather on the loss of their son: "The family, while devastated by the loss, is proud of his service to the country. His perspective on life was pretty good. He had focus. He had drive. He did what he thought he could do best. He died for it." MAY IS THIRD-DEADLIEST MONTH OF WAR FOR U.S TROOPS As of late Tuesday, there were 113 U.S. deaths in Iraq so far in May &#151; trailing only the 137 in November 2004 and the 135 in April 2004. Eight of the soldiers were from Task Force Lightning &#151; six killed when explosions hit near their vehicles and two in a helicopter crash. Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believes the aircraft was brought down by small arms fire, and that the roadside bomb that killed a response team headed to the crash site was not the newer, armor piercing explosively formed penetrators, or EFPs, that have killed hundreds of U.S. soldiers. Speaking to Pentagon reporters, Wiggins called the assault a "complex attack." But he also said the military continues to "adjust our flight maneuvering and our routes in order to not become predictable and in order to make it more difficult" for the enemy. 'THIS IS WHO YOU WOULD PICK' FOR YOUR SON Heidtman was a 2001 graduate of Norwich Free Academy and a graduate of the University of Connecticut. "If you had to pick your son, this is who you would pick. He was handsome, he was bright," Chris Heidtman said. Heidtman arrived in Iraq in December and was scheduled to come home for leave in July. "We're sending our finest, and we're losing them," Chris Heidtman said. Connecticut Gov. M. Jodi Rell ordered all state and U.S. flags lowered to half-staff in Heidtman's honor. "Lt. Heidtman made the ultimate sacrifice for all of us, and he did so to protect the freedom that we so often take for granted," Rell said in a statement. "To have given his life on Memorial Day is especially poignant." Funeral arrangements have not been announced. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Get a look behind the scenes at New York politics and statewide campaigns here. New York Stays Blue But Reds Like Rudy 10:46 am by Rick Karlin New York remains overwhelmingly Democratic in the latest Siena Research Institute poll , with Dems getting at least 50 percent of the vote in any presidential matchups.For example, New Yorkers prefer Hillary Clinton over Rudy Giuliani by a 52-39 percent margin and Hillary trumps McCain 54 to 36.Barack Obama beats Giuliani 50 to 40 and McCain by a 50 to 33 percent margin. Al Gore would whip Fred Thompson 56 to 28 with Hillary beating him 57 to 29. New York has been a blue state since 1988 and poll spokesman Steve Greenberg says there&#8217;s no reason to think that will change. Among Republicans, though, Giuliani is way ahead in New York crushing McCain, his closest contender 52-14. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter if Rudy faces 10 opponents or just four. Either way he wins big,'&#8217; said Greenberg. &#8220;New York has been a blue state since 1988&#8243; Are we better off now than we were in 1988? Comment by Ed Rooney &#8212; Comment by Andrew C.

http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20070531/aclu_to_sue_boeing_subsidiary_over_alleged_torture-id-104301.html&cid ACLU to sue Boeing subsidiary over alleged torture flights - The Money Times Advertise on this site Thursday 31st of May 2007 09:45:27 PM - Loans & Credit - Science & Medicine Bollywood News & Gossip Shopping comparison and reviews ACLU to sue Boeing subsidiary over alleged torture flights - 0 comments The American Civil Liberties Union is going to sue Jeppesen Dataplan Inc., a San Jose subsidiary of Chicago-based Boeing. The blue chip company has allegedly been involved with the Central Intelligence Agency with âthe forced disappearance, torture and inhumane treatmentâ of three men suspected of being terrorists. According to the suit, âPublicly available records demonstrate that Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret rendition flights over a four-year period to countries where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted legal standardsâ. The three men on behalf of whom the suit was brought includes Binyam Mohamed, an Ethiopian, who was allegedly mistreated in July 2002 and January 2004; Elkassim Britel, an Italian, who was first apprehended in Pakistan and subjected to torture in May 2002 and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian who, while seeking asylum in Sweden was arrested by Swedish police and handed over to the CIA, underwent torture in December 2001. While Mohamed is currently being held in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Britel is being held in Morocco and Agiza in Egypt. Mike pound, a spokesperson for Jeppesen has said, âThere isn't really anything I can say with the exception that I am aware of the suit. We have not been served. I can't talk specifics about any customers that we might have or the services we might provide for themâ. Boeingâs representative Timothy Neale has commented, âWe have not gotten the lawsuit yet, so we are not commenting on it. We are not confirming the reports that Jeppesen did work for the CIA. The services Jeppesen provides are provided on a confidential basis for all its customers.â The suit alleges that the detainees were taken to countries where they underwent inhumane, degrading treatment and torture since they were beyond the reach of the law. The suit also states that Jeppesen provided services to the flight and crew used in the rendition program âto unlawfully render plaintiffs to detention and interrogation in Morocco, Egypt and Afghanistanâ. The suspects were apprehended under the U.S. government's âextraordinary rendition programâ. Extraordinary rendition is the clandestine capture and transfer of suspects to be detained and interrogated in countries where the protection of U.S. laws does not apply, said Ben Wizner, an ACLU attorney. He also said that âEither they knew or reasonably should have known that they were facilitating a torture program.â The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

The South Florida Water Management District reported today a record low of just under nine feet, surpassing the mark set during a 2001 drought. The region's drought is leading water managers to assess how to best protect drinking water supplies, meet needs of the important agriculture industry and protect natural resources. The average water level should be around 13 feet this time of year in the second-largest freshwater lake in the contiguous United States. The record low is the result of months of lower-than-normal rainfall levels that have afflicted the main backup water supply for 5 million South Florida residents. Lake Okeechobee is also the liquid heart of the Everglades. . The Associated Press contributed to this report. All rights reserved.

Staff Sgt. Thomas M. McFall, 36, died Monday when an improvised explosive device detonated near his position during a "dismounted patrol" in Baghdad, according to a statement issued by officials at Fort Lewis, Wash., where McFall was based. Also killed in the blast was 20-year-old Cpl. Junior Cedeno Sanchez of Miami. The two soldiers were assigned to the Stryker Brigade Combat Team of the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. Records indicate that McFall's family lived on the 1300 block of Westridge Avenue in Glendora in the early 1990s. But McFall's wife, Emily McFall, said he always considered Riverside home. "He joined the service quite awhile ago, in 1994; he never mentioned Glendora," said Emily McFall. Emily McFall said her husband leaves behind a son and two daughters. "Somehow, he always took over the barbecue, even if it was someone else's house," read the statement.

In a court filing today, Patrick Fitzgerald provides a summary of Valerie Plame Wilson's status with the CIA's Counterproliferation Division at the time she was outed to the press by members of the Bush administration. Guess what? While assigned to CPD, Ms. Wilson engaged in temporary duty (TDY) travel overseas on official business. She traveled at least seven times to more than ten countries. When traveling overseas, Ms. Wilson always traveled under a cover identity &#151 sometimes in true name and sometimes in alias &#151 but always using cover &#151 whether official or non-official cover (NOC) &#151 with no ostensible relationship to the CIA. At the time of the initial unauthorized disclosure in the media of Ms. Wilson's employment relationship with the CIA on 14 July 2003, Ms. Wilson was a covert employee for whom the CIA was taking affirmative measures to conceal her intelligence relationship to the United States. So that settles that. I hope the wingosphere can finally stop bleating about how she wasn't "really" covert and there was no harm in what Libby et. al. did. On another note, this probably means I was wrong about the reason Fitzgerald didn't try to prosecute anyone for leaking Plame's name. (Libby was tried only for perjury, not for outing a covert agent.) I figured it was because Plame had been working inside the U.S. for six years at the time of the leak, and one of the technical elements of "covert" under the IIPA Act is that the agent has "within the last five years served outside the United States." been working under cover outside the U.S. quite extensively during the previous five years, which means that Plame almost certainly qualified as "covert" under the specific definitions outlined in IIPA. Nonetheless, for some reason Fitzgerald decided not to bring outing charges against anyone. This suggests that Mark Kleiman has been right all along: Fitzgerald's decision had nothing to do with technical aspects of IIPA, but rather with its requirements. That is, the leakers had to that leaking Plame's name could be damaging, and Fitzgerald didn't think he had the evidence to make that case. That might have been especially true since the leaks seem to have been authorized at very high levels, something the leakers could have used in their defense at trial. Anyway, it's still a bit of a mystery. But we're a tiny step closer to understanding it.

In her open resignation letter on the Daily Kos, she says, "Good-bye America ...you are not the country that I love and I finally realized no matter how much I sacrifice, I can't make you be that country unless you want it." Her "Goodbye America" is a switch from what she said less than a year ago. She previously said, "I could leave if I wanted to and, in fact, have received many offers to be an ex-patriot in many friendly countries. However, I want to stay and fight for my country." Sheehan says the Peace Movement is bad, the political parties are bad, and everyone who spoke against her are "narrow-minded." Well, Seems the one thing all of them have in common now is that they don't want Sheehan around. So, she did get rivals to agree. The problem with Sheehan is that her cause got distorted. She made it a show by aligning herself with some of the worst people she could find. How President Hugo Chavez got involved in her cause leaves one to wonder. He makes leftist Americans seem tame. He is the protégé of Fidel Castro, and she thought it was ok to have a meeting with him; a meeting that could be considered almost treasonous. Her resignation letter blames everybody for her decision to leave the limelight, but the reality is people were no longer supporting her. The Anti-war cause has supporters, but her as the spokesperson was becoming a liability. She said, "I renounced any tie I have remaining with the Democratic Party, I have been further trashed on such "liberal blogs" as the Democratic Underground. Being called an "attention whore" and being told "good riddance" are some of the more milder rebukes." The Democratic Underground has made an official letter calling for her to stay, and saying that she should be able to take some criticism as a public figure. Apparently not, since she was doing this all for her son. It is like the get out of jail free card. She claims that America killed her son, but what did she do to his legacy? Instead of letting him be the hero, she made him into a cause and then quit. Whether she really really leaves or not is immaterial, because to the hundreds of parents out there who lost children in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, she gave the ultimate insult. She said it was for "nothing" which is a lie straight from the pit of hell. I like being eclectic. I can enjoy many of the greats most people my age never heard of or stopped listening to like Elie Wiesel or Dr. Maya Angelou. They were the ones who taught me that even in the midst of discrimination, loss, or whatever life throws at you , that I could rise above it. Delores has earned a B.S. degree from Lee University and a Diploma of Practical Theology from Christ for the Nations Institute.

The vote, along racial lines, was 15 in favor and 25 against, with seven abstentions. Al Vann, the amendment&#39;s sponsor, made a 23-minute appeal to his colleagues that touched on the nation&#39;s legacy of slavery and racial injustice. Charles Barron (D-Brooklyn) clashed with Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum when he exceeded his allotted two minutes of floor time. Refusing to stop speaking, Barron pointed at Council Speaker Christine Quinn and blasted her as a hypocrite. "You brought us to a place of divide that this City Council has never experienced. You have divided us more than Sonny Carson ever divided any people," he charged, pointing his finger at her. Quinn&#39;s staff was so miffed, her aides went over and turned off the microphones. "We&#39;re not voting on the civil- rights movement . . . we&#39;re voting on a person . . . who has been a representative of black separatism," said Oliver Koppell (D-Bronx). Carson, who died at age 66 in 2002, infamously led a boycott of Korean delis in Brooklyn in 1990.

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was the first to touch down. Attending a hotel fundraiser and mingling at a Bur- lingame diner Wednesday, he declared himself "the one Republican candidate with a legitimate chance to win California," and assailed the tax policies of Democratic contender Hillary Rodham Clinton as a threat to the high-tech economy. Hours later Wednesday, Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards turned up at Google for a town hall meeting. "America is increasingly divided by income and wealth," Edwards told employees at the company's Mountain View offices. "And that gap is not good. It's not healthy for this country." He pledged to increase average Americans' access to the Internet by expanding cost-effective broadband technology to "create as much openness and democracy as we can" online. Sen. Clinton, D-N.Y., who Wednesday picked up the endorsement of Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, will travel to Santa Clara today to address computer industry executives at the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. Later, Clinton will head to Sacramento for a private fundraiser at the Rancho Cordova home of real estate developer Eleni Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis. The trio of scheduled appearances in Silicon Valley in less than 24 hours underscored candidates' competition for the hearts -- and dollars -- of California's venture capitalists, Internet entrepreneurs and technology innovators. With Silicon Valley decidedly in play, presidential contenders of both major political parties are lining up contributors and endorsements and chasing high-tech support. Giuliani met with voters at the art deco Broadway Grill in Burlingame before being feted by 200 donors at a nearby Hyatt Hotel fundraiser led by prominent Saratoga venture capitalist Floyd Kwamme. Giuliani declared himself a rare Republican who can win in blue state California. "I'm here as a candidate because I can help make California competitive in the general election," he said. Meeting later with reporters, Giuliani lit into Clinton for proposing increases in capital gains taxes and a rollback of President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy. He charged that her plan would harm business growth in Silicon Valley. "It would hurt our economy. It would hurt this area traumatically," Giuliani said. "That kind of tax increase would see a decline in your venture capital. It would see a decline in your ability to focus on new technologies and new development. These are massive tax increases that Mrs. Clinton is proposing." Clinton, campaigning Tuesday in New Hampshire, charged that Bush's tax cuts have primarily benefited the richest Americans while doing little to help middle-class families. She vowed to eliminate tax breaks that reward companies for moving jobs overseas, to cut back on subsidies for oil companies and to expand the earned-income tax credit to reduce poverty. As Giuliani was criticizing Clinton in Burlingame, she was in Los Angeles locking up one of California's most sought-after Democratic endorsements. Villaraigosa, the popular mayor and a leading Latino political figure, announced his endorsement after Clinton toured UCLA's Krieger Center preschool to tout her plan to make preschool available for all children in America. "Her depth and breadth of experience is unmatched, and I'm confident she will be the kind of partner our cities and towns need from the federal government," Villaraigosa said in his endorsement. The New York senator is to appear today at a Silicon Valley "Business Climate Summit" hosted by chief executives including Bruce Chizen of Adobe, Bill Watkins of Seagate Technologies and Mike Splinter of Applied Materials. Before the Google audience, Edwards declared that eliminating poverty "is going to require all of us to take responsibility for a huge moral issue in this country." He also encouraged the high-tech work force to make commitments to resolve "a crisis in climate change" by changing driving and consumption habits. Meanwhile, Edwards, who has made several fundraising trips to Silicon Valley, has picked up the backing of venture capitalists including Andrew Rappaport and former Google engineer David desJardins. Edwards told the crowd he would like to take the influence of money out of politics and advocated public financing of elections. "I'm not holier than thou on this," Edwards said. "But that doesn't mean I believe the system is good," he added later. "I think we need a president who says he is committed to the way we raise political contributions in this country."

When he is sentenced this coming Tuesday, Scooter Libby may be sent directly to jail. If so, this would be grossly unfair sinceÂ he stands an excellent chance of being acquitted on appeal.Â But it would also be the moment for President Bush to pardon him immediately. Back in March, when he was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice by a jury in federal court in Washington D.C., I why I thought the case ârepresents a terrible injustice.â The federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, had insisted to both the public andÂ the jury that the disclosure of the identity of the CIA operative Valerie Plameâwhich was the underlying actionÂ heÂ had beenÂ appointed to investigateâwas in fact a crime. But this was a point that had never been established or even formally alleged.Â Fitzgeraldâs overreaching onÂ this colored the juryâs thinking about the gravity of the issues at stake, suggested a motive for Libby to lie that did not reside in proved facts, and conflicted with the judgeâs ruling that the case would hinge on Plameâs status. Now Fitzgerald has been back in court, that when Libby is sentenced on Tuesday, the judge should throw the book at him precisely on the grounds that he committed the underlying crime-that-was-not-a-crime. Fitzgerald approvingly cites Judge David S. Tatelâs ruling in the Judith Miller case that âbecause the charges contemplated hereÂ relate to false denials of responsibility for Plameâs exposure, prosecuting perjury or false statements would be tantamount to punishing the leak.â But this a vicious circle. Convicted on the basis of something that was never proved or even formally alleged, is Libby now to be punished on the same basis? With Fitzgerald continuing to overreach, the case for a presidential pardon is growing stronger by the day. If Libby is imprisoned, will Bush do the right thing? Meanwhile, in closely related news, Senator Kit Bond of Missouri, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence, wants the committee to re-interview Valerie Plame. Back in March, inÂ a dispatch entitled Lying Liars and Their Lies , I asked whether Plame was under oath when she testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and declared that she played no role in sending her husband, Ambassador Joseph Wilson, on a fact-finding trip to Niger. âI did not recommend him. I did not suggest him. There was no nepotism involved. I did not have the authority,â she said. under oath, and Senator Bond has pointed out that she has put out three separate versions of the circumstances under which her husband was sent to Niger. According to *She told the CIA&#8217;s inspector general in 2003 or 2004 that she had suggested Wilson. *Plame told Senate Intelligence Committee staffers in 2004 that she couldn&#8217;t remember whether she had suggested Wilson. *She told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in March that an unidentified person in Vice President Cheney&#8217;s office asked a CIA colleague about the African uranium report in February 2002. A third officer, overhearing Plame and the colleague discussing this, suggested, &#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t we send Joe?&#8221; Plame told the committee. Which of these is the real story? Is Plame telling three versions of the truth, or is she a lying liar, orÂ even worse, a perjuring perjurer? Bond would like to find out. But the Intelligence Committee is now under the control of the Democrats who have no interest in calling attention to the antics of the Plame-Wilson provocateurs. Stay tuned, in other words, for the cover-up of the cover-up.Â Â  &laquo; back to contentions Email (required, but will not be published) You can use these tags: Dictatorships &#38; Double Standards Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream Why the New Right Lost The War Against World War IV How to Win World War IV Dictatorships and Double Standards My Negro ProblemâAnd Ours Goodbye, Columbus, by Philip Roth reviewed by Saul Bellow The Imagination of Disaster Getting Serious About Iran: A Military Option How Divided Are We?

Mr. Bush says a primary goal is to bring millions of illegal aliens "out of the shadows" and provide a path to legal residency and eventual U.S. citizenship. But while the president champions such reform, the United States is set to implement the largest-ever boost in fees charged to those applying for residency and citizenship. VOA's Michael Bowman reports from Washington that advocates for immigrant say the administration is sending mixed messages to an often fearful and vulnerable community. For newcomers, both legal and undocumented, the cost of pursuing the American dream is about to go up. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service is doubling, and in some cases tripling, its fees. Beginning July 30, the charge for adults seeking residency will exceed $1,000; the fee for citizenship will be nearly $600. Some say the higher fees undermine President Bush's stated goals on immigration. Crystal Williams is a deputy director at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. She says, "To come up with a thousand dollars per family member to obtain permanent residence -- it is going to keep a lot of people in the shadows for a very long time." Williams says the new fees constitute an enormous financial hurdle that will force countless poorer immigrants to delay applications -- and may lead some to give up entirely. But officials at the Citizenship and Immigration Service point out that their agency receives no federal funds to process applications. Costs are covered entirely by fees charged. They say, unless those fees reflect actual costs, services would have to be cut back and waiting times for applicants would increase. USCIS spokesman Chris Bentley explained. "We realize that anytime we increase the fees that there is a burden there. There is pain that is caused along the way. However, to be able to remain a world class service provider, to be able to get the services and benefits in a timely manner to the people who deserve them, we simply need the resources to be able to make that happen." Bentley adds that refugees and asylum-seekers will remain exempt from charge, and some fees can be reduced for residency and citizenship applicants facing dire economic hardship. But if USCIS is constrained by being entirely dependent on fees for operating costs, then it is time to change the system, according to Donald Kerwin of the Catholic Legal Immigration Network. "Citizenship is a national good. It is important for our country,â says Kerwin. âAnd so we think that to fix the system, to reduce backlogs and improve technology, there needs to be appropriated monies for this. It needs to go beyond the fee-based system." Some in Congress counter that it would be wrong to shift the financial burden to U.S. taxpayers. Republican Congressman Steve King of Iowa says the new fees are still far lower than what illegal immigrants typically pay smugglers to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. "We are seeing coyote [smuggler] fees go up to $1500 to $2500 per person,â said Mr. King. âI do not see any fees levied by USCIS that were that high. So if it is cheaper to have access to becoming a citizen than it is to be transported [illegally] to the United States, then, no, I do not think those fees are too high by comparison." Immigration officials also defend the fee system, saying it provides spending flexibility, since revenues go up in proportion to any rise in applications. They say that previous fee hikes have not resulted in drastic reductions in applications for residency or citizenship. Immigrant advocates counter that the current fee hike is far greater than any previous increases. They also note studies showing the percentage of eligible immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship dropping in recent decades. Opinions vary as to the cause, but immigrant advocates say making it more expensive for immigrants to pursue legal status or citizenship can only serve as a further deterrent.

George Bush's new selection to head the World Bank, Robert Zoellick has that over his predecessor, Paul Wolfowitz. But can't the world demand a slightly higher standard? The selection process for chief of the World Bank, which claims to be the world's preeminent anti-poverty institution, is preposterous. By tradition, the post goes to a U.S. citizen, to be selected by the U.S. President. There is no pretense of democracy at this international institution. Nor is there any pretense of demanding relevant development experience. None of the past presidents of the Bank, including Wolfowitz and Zoellick, has had any meaningful experience in development policy. There have been longstanding calls by people who actually care about development, and do have relevant expertise, to reform the Bank's archaic government structure. But more important than the Bank's governing process are its policies. The World Bank's great failings over the last decades are rooted in its commitment to the market fundamentalism known as "the Washington consensus." This is a set of maniacal market-oriented policies including: deregulation of the economy, opening countries up to capital inflows and outflows, removing all trade barriers and orienting economies to support exports, massive privatization (including even of such traditional government functions as customs collection), eliminating subsidies for basic necessities, rolling back legally guaranteed labor rights, cutting back on government services and restricting government spending. The Bank has also maintained a penchant for environmentally and socially destructive mega-development projects: big dams, oil and gas projects, road-building. The result has been a literal human disaster: the developing countries that have most closely hued to policies imposed by the World Bank (and its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund) have found themselves much poorer, less healthy and less educated than countries that have resisted Bank recommendations. In one notable example, the Bank's historic support for user fees for education and healthcare has denied millions of children the right to schooling, and deprived millions of people access to healthcare. The Wolfowitz controversy obscured the bigger issues at the Bank, and the questions now facing Zoellick: Will Zoellick oppose user fees for healthcare Will he support robust public health systems that rely on public providers -- not wishful thinking about HMO-style schemes delivering health care in developing countries? Will he abandon support for water privatization, which delivers profits to multinationals but raises costs to consumers and decreases quality of service? Will he end the Bank's heinous opposition to labor rights in its influential Doing Business report? Will he insist that countries be able to expand healthcare and education budgets, despite pressure from the International Monetary Fund? Will he support the recommendations of Bank-supported expert investigations, and end support for mega-development projects? As the U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Zoellick pushed market extremist policies akin to those of the Bank, in World Trade Organization negotiations, and especially in bilateral and regional trade agreement negotiations. His very aggressive agenda as USTR increased monopoly rights for drug companies eliminating precautionary health measures removing protections for small farmers eliminating protective industrial tariffs in developing countries (a key element of the misnamed "Doha Development Round" of World Trade Organization talks that Zoellick helped kick off). To be fair to Zoellick, every recent person in his post, Republican or Democrat, has pushed the same Big Business agenda that he did. And on pharmaceutical and patent issues -- some of the key considerations at USTR -- he did not do everything Big Pharma wanted, and sometimes really pushed against the industry's interests (until overridden by the White House.) On the other hand, the fact that other former U.S. Trade Representatives pushed a broad Big Business agenda is hardly an argument for why Zoellick should be rewarded with the World Bank post. It is a better argument for why no former USTRs should be given the job. And even though Zoellick had major conflicts with Big Pharma, he did at the end of the day deliver on almost everything the companies wanted. As my colleague Asia Russell of the AIDS activist organization Health GAP says, "It's very difficult to imagine the same Bob Zoellick who carried water for Big Pharma being the kind of advocate ministers of health need in order to expand their investments in salaries for doctors and nurses to address 6,000 preventable AIDS deaths each day in Africa alone." The same point could be echoed about the rest of Zoellick's performance as USTR. Unless Zoellick makes a break from market fundamentalism, expect the World Bank to continue to generate rather than reduce poverty. And yes, the world should demand better. For the immediate term, Zoellick should be pressed to make specific commitments to abandon key components of the Bank's failed preferred policy set. The longer term agenda must involve achieving not just better governance at the Bank, but a completely refashioned orientation. * Zoellick does not seem to have been an active part of the Cheney-Rumsfeld cabal that concocted the case for the Iraq war and then carried it out, but he was (along with Paul Wolfowitz and others) a signer of the 1998 letter from the Project for a New American Century to Bill Clinton , urging Clinton "to turn your Administration's attention to implementing a strategy for removing Saddam's regime from power. This will require a full complement of diplomatic, political and military efforts."

The Senate adjourned in the early evening, and the House went until the midnight deadline with a last-ditch round of tense debate over water, border security and electric deregulation. The embattled Craddick finished the 140-day session as the man in charge of the House. He cocked his head back and laughed as he chatted with some Republican supporters in the House chamber toward the end of the day. Democrats and Republicans alike complain that Craddick has ruled with an iron fist. They say his win-at-all-cost style often forces them to vote against the interests of their own districts. Opponents tried all weekend to oust him from power, with no success. Craddick refused to allow the opposition bring up a motion for a vote to ``vacate the chair.'' Craddick is currently the longest-serving House member and the first Republican speaker since Reconstruction, having taken over in 2003 after the GOP won a majority of House seats. Frustrated by their failed attempts to overthrow Craddick, dozens of angry House members stormed out of the chamber in protest in the early morning hours Monday. ``This man is sitting here violating every rule of the House, every rule of parliamentary procedure to keep himself in office, and it's wrong,'' said Rep. Pat Haggerty, a Republican. A prepared statement from Craddick's office chided those it said were trying to divert the House from important matters and trying to drag lawmakers into a speaker's race. Despite some 11th-hour fights and threats in the Senate to filibuster the budget bill, the House and Senate signed off late Sunday night and early Monday on a compromise $153 billion two-year spending plan, the state's largest ever.

Murder Cold Case Under Way Wednesday May 30, 2007 5:31 PM AP Photo JX105, JX102 By EMILY WAGSTER PETTUS JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - The cold case trial got under way Wednesday in the deaths of two black teenagers who were beaten and dumped still alive into the Mississippi River during the state's dark days of racial brutality. Ku Klux Klansman James Ford Seale faces federal kidnapping and conspiracy charges - along with potentially damaging testimony from a man also charged back in 1964. U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate began questioning prospective jurors Wednesday. ``We're at the doorstep of justice,'' said Thomas Moore, the brother of one of the victims, Charles Eddie Moore. For decades, books and news accounts treated the killings of Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee as footnotes in Mississippi's troubled history. They were 19-year-old friends who were hitchhiking on May 2, 1964, near Meadville when carloads of Ku Klux Klansmen were chasing rumors of a possible armed insurrection by black people in the area. Recent court records said the two were driven to the Homochitto National Forest and beaten, then stuffed into a trunk and driven more than 70 miles to the Mississippi River near Vicksburg. They were weighted down with engine parts and dumped, still breathing, into the Mississippi. Their bodies were found about two months later, when authorities were conducting a massive search for slain civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, who disappeared from central Mississippi's Neshoba County on June 21, 1964. Seale and reputed Klansman Charles Marcus Edwards were arrested in 1964 in the deaths of Dee and Moore. But the FBI was consumed by the ``Mississippi Burning'' investigation of the three civil rights workers and the Dee-Moore case was turned over to local authorities, who threw out all charges against Seale and Edwards. The Justice Department in 2000 reopened an investigation. Edwards has been granted immunity and is expected to testify for the prosecution. Thomas Moore and two of Dee's sisters - Thelma Collins, 70, of Springfield, La.; and Mary Nell Byrd, 61, of Natchez, Miss. - spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday in Jackson during an interview arranged by Canadian Broadcasting Corp. documentary maker David Ridgen. Since 2005, Ridgen and Thomas Moore have pushed federal officials to reopen the case. Ridgen's film, ``Mississippi Cold Case,'' is set to air Saturday night on MSNBC. ``I try not to think about it so much because, you know, it's done now,'' Collins said of her brother's death. ``But every time I think about it, I shed a tear.'' Dee and Charles Moore were not troublemakers, their families say. ``My thing is, Charles Moore and Henry Dee wasn't bothering anybody,'' Thomas Moore said Tuesday. ``And for them to be butchered, tormented, hassled and drowned in the river - it was pretty bad.'' Collins and Moore said they're prepared for any outcome in the Seale trial. ``I just have it in my heart that they're going to do the right thing,'' Collins said. Moore has already planned what he'll do after the trial, regardless of the outcome. ``The last thing that I'm going to do when I leave Mississippi, I'm going to go to that cemetery, that Mount Olive Cemetery. I'm going to tell Charles Moore, 'I told you that I (would) see it to the end.''' Join our dating site today Guardian Unlimited &copy; Guardian News and Media Limited 2007

But pundits on the right continue to defend Novak and I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, who was convicted of perjury in the leak investigation, dismissing Plame's covert status and rehashing allegations that she improperly suggested husband Ambassador Joe Wilson's trip to Niger that undercut the Bush administration's pre-war assertions about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. "Like the shape-shifting T-1000 cyborg in Terminator 2, Patrick Fitzgerald's claim that Valerie Plame was a covert agent, and that therefore Scooter Libby deserves a harsh sentence for supposedly outing her, not only won't die a proper death due to lack of proof, it keeps mutating into new forms," Al Johnson on conservative blog the American Thinker. Salon blogger Glen Greenwald more than a dozen instances of Republican pundits insisting prior to Friday's court filing that Plame was not a covert agent. Even White House spokesman Tony Snow told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly in February, "She wasn't a covert agent." Meanwhile, a Republican senator inserted into a last week on pre-war intelligence allegations that Plame lied in her testimony before congressional committees regarding Wilson's trip to Niger. According to Fitzgerald's filing, Plame traveled "sometimes in true name and sometimes in alias -- but always using cover -- whether official or non-official (NOC) -- with no ostensible relationship to the CIA." Blog headingright.com responded to the revelation that Plame traveled overseas "always using cover" in the years prior to her outing with a, la-la-la-I-can't-hear-you. "What you see her (sic) is a complete broadside fabrication from the rogues and nothing more," a poster The main point of contention seems to be that Plame sometimes traveled using her own name and identified herself as a government official if not a CIA agent, although conservative pundits seem to ignore that she also used "non-official cover" during some of her travels, during which she would be seen to have no ostensible relationship with the CIA. "Either way you look at it she was not a covert agent covered by the Intelligence identities Protection Act of 1982," read a post on conservative blog Flopping Aces . "This is why ole Fitz' never brought any charges against the leaker of her name." Plame's name was revealed in a July 14, 2003 column by Novak, which occurred after her husband published an op-ed in the New York Times that called President Bush's assertion in his State of the Union address that year that Saddam Hussein was seeking uranium from Africa untrue. on his blog Captain's Quarters, used the new revelation to criticize George Tenet's tenure at the CIA. "So now we have confirmation that Plame did get her cover blown. I suppose the only reason that Fitzgerald didn't bother to indict Richard Armitage for the crime was that it would have meant explaining how the CIA tried to hide its NOC asset in plain sight," Morrissey wrote, referring to the former deputy Secretrary of State who was eventually revealed to be Novak's original source. Conservatives have tried to undercut that assertion by insisting that Plame simply sent her husband on a "junket" to Africa, despite the contacts he built as an ambassador on the continent. Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., attached to a Senate intelligence report released last week a memo he said proved Plame recommended her husband for the trip, undercutting her assertion she had nothing to do with arranging the trip. the memo "doesn't square" with her testimony that an unnamed CIA colleague raised her husband's name. The memo from Plame reads, in part, "As you may recall [redacted] of CP/[office2] recently [2001] approached my husband to possibly use his contacts in Niger to investigate [a separate Niger matter] ... My husband is willing to help if it makes sense, but no problem if not, end of story." Plame's attorney told USA Today that Plame was not responsible for Wilson's trip. Bond's report, the attorney said, is an attempt to draw attention from the "real wrong here -- a White House that outed a covert operative and undermined national security."

That's the assessment of state Rep. Chuck Hopson (DJacksonville), who said the Legislature took a $15 billion surplus at the start of the session and "gave a little money to a lot of programs." In the final hours of the session, the Legislature provided a funding package of approximately $12 million to transfer the Texas State Railroad from the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department and privatize the excursion train with a private operator. "I have unbelievable, mixed emotions on the train," said Rep. Hopson. "I'm unhappy that it is not in the parks department. However, I feel real good that we're going to keep it rolling." Austin political watchers feared that funding for the rail authority was going to become mired in politics last week because of an attempted coup in the House of Representatives to unseat Speaker Tom Craddick. State Rep. Byron Cook, who authored the House bill to privatize the train, made a personal privilege speech on the floor and called for Mr. Craddick to step aside as speaker. Supporters of the move to privatize the train feared that Speaker Craddick might retaliate against Rep. Cook and de-rail efforts to fund the privatization. The omnibus appropriations bill, which is the funding mechanism for all state agencies, hung in the balance as Republican factions dueled on the House floor and maneuvered around rules and points of order to attempt to unseat Speaker Craddick throughout the weekend. On Saturday, members of the Legislature faced a possibility of not passing an appropriations bill and having to return during the summer for a special session to pass a budget bill. Tempers subsided briefly with the passage of HB 1. Shortly after the House signed off on the bill Saturday night, state Rep. Pat Haggerty (R-El Paso) tried one last time to unseat the speaker by taking a roll call vote. When that effort failed, he called on members to stage a walk-out at 1:30 a.m. Approximately 56 state representatives, both Democrat and Republican, walked off the floor in protest of Speaker Craddick's interpretations of house rules. "I stayed on the House floor and did not participate in the walk-out," said Rep. Hopson. "I thought we still had business to conduct." More than 30 bills required House action, including the controversial water bill, which designates 19 unique reservoir sites, and a funding bill for the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department. The House adjourned after the walk-out early Monday morning, but resumed session at 2 p.m. The proposed Lake Fastrill, located on the Neches River between Rusk and Palestine, had been removed from the House version of the bill. However, the Senate succeeded in getting Lake Fastrill added to the water bill. New language in the bill requires a commitment of funding by 2015 in order to retain the "unique reservoir" designation at each of the proposed, 19 locations. Stand-out legislation that Rep. Hopson said he is happy to see passed includes: + The Castle doctrine, which provides for a homeowner's right to defend his property against an intruder + Jessica's Law (HB 8), which provides tougher penalties against sex offenders, including capital punishment for some offenses + a law which prohibits law enforcement officers from confiscating firearms during a disaster such as a hurricane + expansion of the CHIPs program. "We added a whole bunch of kids to CHIPs and that's good for East Texas," said Rep. Hopson. "There are a lot of employers who provide insurance for mom and dad, but not for kids." Rep. Hopson said he is also pleased with reforms outlined for the Texas Youth Commission, and he said he is optimistic that the new executive commissioner will bring stability to the troubled agency. He said he hoped to see enough money funneled into the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department to allow state parks to be brought up to standards. "A lot of good things happened this time," said Rep. Hopson, citing property tax cuts which will be phased in. Even though the 180-day session adjourned at midnight Monday, Legislators are already looking ahead to the 81st session which will meet in January 2009. At least five Republicans have announced their intentions to run for House Speaker. System and Method for Display Ads have a Patent Pending. Click Here for More Information
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/nyregion/31street.html&cid Council Rejects Street Name for Black Activist - New York Times Council Rejects Street Name for Black Activist Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: a racially divisive hearing, the City Council yesterday rejected a measure that would have named a street after Sonny Carson, a radical black activist who more than once described himself as &#8220;antiwhite.&#8221; The Council rejected the amendment in a 25-to-15 vote that was divided along racial lines, as protesters in the balcony hissed at each vote cast against it. The loudest jeers were reserved for Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, the amendment&#8217;s most prominent opponent, and seven black or Hispanic council members who abstained from voting. But while the outcome was widely expected, the high-decibel meeting, preceded by a rally on the steps of City Hall, was a stark contrast to the normally subdued process the Council goes through once or twice a year in choosing people to honor with street names. It was also one the most divisive issues to confront Ms. Quinn, the council&#8217;s first openly gay speaker and an ardent supporter of civil rights causes, in her year and half as speaker. At one point, Councilman Charles Barron, a Brooklyn Democrat and a former Black Panther, refused to stop talking after his two-minute comment period. Wagging a finger in Ms. Quinn&#8217;s direction, Mr. Barron said, &#8220;You have divided us more than Sonny Carson ever did.&#8221; For her part, Ms. Quinn said of Mr. Carson, &#8220;He was not an individual who sought to bring our city together.&#8221; Mr. Carson, who died in 2002, was an ex-convict who became a community advocate and antidrug crusader. Some saw him as a community leader, but others saw him as a thug and a bigot. Once asked about charges of being anti-Semitic, he said: &#8220;That&#8217;s absolutely absurd, &#8216;anti-Semitic.&#8217; And so you don&#8217;t ask the question, I&#8217;m antiwhite. Don&#8217;t limit my antis to just one group of people.&#8221; He was convicted in 1974 of kidnapping in a case prosecutors described as a vigilante-style attack that left one person dead and another near death. He was sentenced to seven years in prison. He re-emerged in the 1980s to crusade against drugs and police brutality. &#8220;Sonny Carson got more crack houses closed than the entire Police Department,&#8221; Mr. Barron said during the premeeting rally. In 1990, Mr. Carson led a boycott of Korean-owned delis in black neighborhoods, carrying picket signs that said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t shop with people who don&#8217;t look like us.&#8221; Michael C. Nelson, chairman of the Council&#8217;s Jewish Caucus, recalled the time when Mr. Carson first received national attention as a militant protester during the struggle for community control of public schools. &#8220;Thirty-seven years ago, Sonny Carson walked into my wife&#8217;s classroom and said he didn&#8217;t want any white Jews teaching his children, and he also said he would carve his initials on her chest if she didn&#8217;t leave,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am voting no.&#8221; has said of Mr. Carson that there is probably no one who less deserves a street named after him. Councilman Albert Vann, a Brooklyn Democrat who introduced the amendment, said that whether you agreed or disagreed with Mr. Carson&#8217;s tactics, the community should have the right to decide whom to name streets after. Community Board 3 of Brooklyn had voted in favor of renaming four blocks of Gates Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant to Sonny Abubadika Carson Avenue. Community Board support is required to rename a street, for which Council approval is usually little more than a formality. There were 51 names on the Council&#8217;s list this year, including the actor Jerry Orbach and the modern dance pioneer Alvin Ailey.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Bush Delivers Remarks on Immigration Reform Tuesday, May 29, 2007; 2:29 PM PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Thank you all very much. Please be seated, unless, of course, you don't have a chair. Bush Promotes New Immigration Plan GLYNCO, Ga., May 29 -- President Bush took to the road today to promote a bipartisan plan to overhaul immigration laws, assailing conservative critics he said were trying to scare the American public and accusing them of not reading the bill. Save & Share Article Thanks for having me. I'm honored to be here at the headquarters of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. I don't know whether you realize this or not, but the government originally planned to open this center inside the Capital Beltway. No one looks very sad that we didn't open it in front of the Capital Beltway. It's a spectacular place to have this center. It is a glorious place to live. I'm honored to be in your presence. Thanks for letting me come by and share some thoughts with you. I want to thank Director Patrick for her strong leadership and her kind introduction. I appreciate very much the tour I have just taken. A lot of our fellow citizens probably don't know what goes on here, but this is a center full of smart, capable instructors who are helping to train men and women who've volunteered to serve our country on the front lines of protecting the homeland. I am grateful to be in your midsts. I thank those of you who work here. I thank those of you who are being trained here. And I thank your families as well. We have a mission, a vital mission. And that's to protect our country. And you all are on the front lines of that protection. And it gives me great confidence when I meet you to tell the American people there's a lot of decent souls doing everything they can to provide security for the American people. So thanks. I appreciate the folks at FLETC that I met that are working the border and helping train people to secure this border of ours. And I've come today not only to thank you, but to talk about immigration. BUSH: Immigration is a vital issue facing this country. And the fundamental question is, will elected officials have the courage necessary to put a comprehensive immigration plan in place that makes it more likely we can enforce our border and at the same times uphold the great traditions -- immigrant traditions of the United States of America. That's what I want to discuss with you. Before I do that, I do want to introduce some people. I want to introduce Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez. I appreciate you coming, Mr. Secretary. Carlos wasn't born here. He was born in another country, Cuba. And now he sits in the Cabinet of the president of the United States. There's something great about a country that welcomes people, people who uphold our laws and realize the great blessings of America. With us as well is Senator Mel Martinez. He wasn't born in America. He's a senator from Florida. He was born in Cuba. I don't know if you know his story, but his mother and father put him on an airplane to come to the United States of America to be raised by total strangers because they didn't want their son to grow up under a tyrant named Fidel Castro. He used to sit in the Cabinet of the president of the United States. Now he sits in the United States Senate. What a wonderful country it is, where people can come to live in a country based upon liberty and realize the great blessings of our country. And I want to mention those two men because to me they represent what the immigration debate is all about: Will we be a welcoming place, a place of law that renews our spirit by giving people a chance to succeed? So, Senator, thank you for coming as well. I saved the other two traveling with me because they were born here. Starting with the United States senator from Georgia, a South Georgian named Saxby Chambliss; one of the finest senators in the United States Senate. BUSH: Finally, I asked Secretary Mike Chertoff to leave the bench to become the director of the Department of Homeland Security. It's a big job. It's a job that requires organizing various agencies under one task, and that's to provide protection to the American people. And Secretary Chertoff's doing a fine job. I'm glad he's joined us today. Thanks for coming, Mr. Secretary. I thank all the state and local officials who are here who have joined us. Appreciate you taking the time to come over and say hello. I thank the citizens from this part of the world who have joined us as well. Thanks for supporting this good institution. I know you know this, but FLETC provides an important role for this country of ours. And I thank you for supporting it. Before I talk about immigration, I do want to offer condolences for Agent Robert Smith. He died last week from injuries in a helicopter crash. He was a Customs and Border Protection agent. He reminds us on a regular basis that those who are on the front line of protecting the country take danger as a part of their job. And therefore we offer our deepest condolences for Robert Smith, his family and his friends, and we ask for God's blessings on them. Our nation depends on our federal agents to enforce our immigration laws at the border and across the country. You got a big job to do. We're counting on you to enforce those laws. And when you graduate from FLETC you're going to be an important part of that role. That's why you're here: It's to upgrade your skills so you have the capacity to do the job the country expects you to do. You're going to safeguard our ports of entry, you'll investigate workplace immigration violations, and you'll arrest those breaking the law. We're a nation of laws, and we expect people to keep the laws. And if they break the laws, there will be a consequence. This administration of mine is committed to ensuring that our federal agents have the resources you need to carry out your responsibilities. BUSH: And for some of the older hands here -- and I'm not going to pick you out of the crowd... ... I'm sure you will tell some of the younger folks that things have changed significantly over the past years. One way to measure how things have changed is look at the budget. We've doubled the funding for border security since I took office. We now spend $10 billion a year to protect this border. One commitment to the American people that we're serious about helping you do your job is to spend more money on the job. It's a way to measure whether or not we're meeting our words with commitment. And we are. We've used additional money -- people say, what are you spending it on? -- well, we're expanding the number of Border Patrol agents from about 9,000 to 13,000. And by the end of -- we have expanded it -- and by the end of 2008, we're going to have 18,000 agents. We will have more than doubled the Border Patrol in a relatively quick period of time. We believe the more manpower is on the border, the more likely it is we will be able to enforce the border, like the American people expect us to do. We're investing in new technology. We're strengthening infrastructure. In other words, we've taken our duty seriously, to protect the border of the United States of America. As a matter of fact, we take it so seriously that I asked the governors to -- you know, to put some National Guard troops down there until our Border Patrol agents got trained. And we're beginning to see some results. You know, in this immigration debate, oftentimes, people say, "Well, they're not doing anything to protect the border." Well, those folks just simply don't know what's going on. You do. The men and women who wear the uniform understand what's going on. There's a focused, concerted effort to enforce our border. As a matter of fact, you can tell when the border's better defended because the number of arrests go down. In other words, when people know there's a consequence to trying to sneak across, there's less likely to be people sneaking across. Arrests have gone down by 27 percent over the past year on the southern border. BUSH: That's a sign of progress. It should say to the American people that we're doing what the people expect us to do. The new infrastructure's making a difference. The Predators make a difference. The number of Border Patrol agents make a difference. I don't know if any of you spent time out in Artesia, New Mexico, if you're working for the Border Patrol. But I was impressed with boot camp. And they're training these Border Patrol agents to do the hard work that the American people expect them to do. You know, one of the problems we had prior to the administration addressing the problem was we had what was called -- what then was called catch-and-release. (inaudible) Border Patrol agent working hard, finding somebody trying to sneak into our country illegally. They'd catch them. And then they'd say, "Well, look, you need to come back for your hearing. We're going to let you out, but come back for your hearing." Well, the problem was that people didn't want to come back for their hearing. They generally wanted to go work. And so they would just disappear. And it discouraged our Border Patrol agents. I talked to too many agents and heard too many stories about people saying, "Wait a minute, I'm tired of doing my job on the front line of protecting the border only to have the people that I have stopped coming in meld into our society." And so we work with Congress and we've got a lot of detention facilities now along the border. See, we didn't have space before. Now we do have space. And as a result, catch-and-release has virtually been eliminated. It sends a strong -- getting rid of the catch-and-release program sends a strong signal to people: "If you come to the country, we will find you and we're going to send you home. So don't try to come in the first place." In other words, we're working hard to enforce the border. And we're stepping up enforcement inside the country. I see a lot of ICE hats. These are the folks that are charged with making sure that people who knowingly hire somebody who's here illegally pay a price. In other words, part of making sure our country has the rule of law, we've got to have people enforce the law. It's against the law to hire somebody who's here illegally. That's the law. And we're training people here to make sure that they know how to enforce that law. And the message to employers: "If you're hiring somebody here that you know is illegal, we're going to -- there's a consequence to be paid." That's what a nation that bases its system on rule of law does. That's what we'll continue to do. BUSH: And ICE is active. Your folks are working hard. ICE investigations have led to more than 3,000 arrests for immigration violations since the beginning of this fiscal year, nearly 600 arrests for criminal violations, including fraud and identity theft, and nearly $30 million in penalties against businesses that have violated the law. We're working hard to enforce the border. In the immigration debate you hear people say, "Well, they're not doing anything to enforce the border." They're wrong, and you know they're wrong. And I'm here to thank you for doing -- for working as hard as you can. And now we got to build on the progress. It's important for American citizens to understand that the immigration system is in desperate need for comprehensive reform. And Congress has a historic window to act. The system isn't working. Think about a system that encourages smugglers to stuff people in 18-wheelers, people that want to work, people want to provide for their families. Think about a system in which there's tremendous document forgery. You know, you got a person out here in South Georgia needs somebody to help them on their farm. Person shows up with documents. They don't know whether they're real or not. There's a lot of forgery going on. We got people -- in my judgment, this isn't what America should be about. And yet the system is broken to the point where people are being used as human cargo, being exploited, simply because most want to come and provide for their families. Most are willing to do jobs Americans aren't doing. The system needs to be fixed. I appreciate the Republicans and Democrats in the United States Senate, starting with Saxby Chambliss and Mel Martinez, who put politics aside and put courage first to work on a comprehensive bill. It takes a lot of courage in the face of some of the criticism in the political world to do what's right, not what's comfortable. BUSH: And what's right is to fix this system now before it's too late. And I thank you two for your courage. And Carlos and Mike Chertoff spent a lot of time sitting with the senators from both political parties. I don't know if you're tired of it, but a lot of Americans are simply tired of this endless political bickering, that we can't work together because it might make somebody else look good. I tried to change the system. It's not working. So I sat the two secretaries in there with the senators from both parties and said, "OK, why don't we sit down and see if we can't figure something -- something what's good for the country? Each side's going to have to give a little bit. Not everybody's going to get everything they want. But what matters more is fixing the problem now." And we're making some progress. Most Americans -- or many Americans say their primary concern is border security, and ensuring that those who violate our laws face consequences. That's what you're hearing out there when you're listening to the debate. Others say their chief concern is keeping this economy strong. There's -- a lot of employers need a legal way to fill jobs that Americans simply aren't doing. There's a lot of jobs here in Georgia that require people from -- that are willing to do the work that Americans aren't doing. It's just the way it is. You talk to your farmer friends or your nursery friends -- I remember the peach grower, Saxby, that you sent over to the White House. He's there saying to me, "You've got to understand something, Mr. President: My business won't go forward unless I have some of these good people that are willing to work long hours in my peach orchard helping me harvest the crop." So a lot of people in this debate are concerned about getting a bill in place that'll help keep the economy growing. Others say their main concern is to bring hard-working, decent people out of the shadows of our society. BUSH: All these concerns are part of the same issue. And it's important for American citizens to understand that the legislation now before Congress addresses them all as one. Our view is is that you can't solve the problem unless you address all aspects of the problem. We've tried to address immigration reform in the past by talking about only one aspect of immigration reform. To make it work, to address the concerns of the American people, there must be a comprehensive approach. A lot of Americans are skeptical about immigration reform, primarily because they don't think the government can fix the problems. And my answer to the skeptics is, give us a chance to fix the problems in a comprehensive way that enforces our border and treats people with decency and respect. Give us a chance to fix this problem. Don't try to kill this bill before it gets moving. Give us a chance to make it easier for the folks who wear the uniform along our borders to do our job. I believe the bill before Congress learns from the mistakes of the past. It is the best hope for lasting reform. If people are interested in fixing a system that's broken, this bill is the best hope to do so. It answers the longstanding concerns of the American people. It deserves widespread support. And I strongly back it. If you're serious about securing our borders, it makes sense to support legislation that makes enforcement our highest priority. And that's what this bill does. For decades, we have not been in complete control of the borders and many people have lost faith in our capacity to get control of the borders. I asked them to look at what's taken place over the past years -- recent years. I wish they could talk to some of your Border Patrol friends and talk about the advances that have been made and the good work they're doing down there. The first step to comprehensive reform must be to enforce immigration laws at the borders and at worksites across America. And this is what this bill does. But the skeptics who say that we're not concerned about border security or workplace enforcement, they need to read the bill. The bill prioritizes enforcing our laws at the border and saying to employers, "We'll hold you to account for employing somebody who's here illegally -- knowingly employing somebody who's here illegally." BUSH: This bill sets enforcement benchmarks that have got to be met before the other aspects of the comprehensive bill are triggered. In other words, there has to be certain accomplishments in place before other aspects of the bill come into being. And here are some of those markers: increasing the number of Border Patrol agents. In other words, we said we're going to double them. They've got to get doubled until other aspects of the bill come into being. We're going to build miles of state-of-the-art fencing. We're going to improve surveillance with advanced technologies. We will do a better job of holding employers accountable for the workers they hire. Most employers want to comply with the law. The peach grower wanted to comply with the law. Believe me, he's a law- abiding, decent man. His attitude is, "Why don't you help me verify the legal status of a potential employee, as opposed to holding me to account" -- which we will do, of course, if he knowingly hires somebody -- "give me a hand with a verification system." And that's why we're going to promote tamper-resistant identification cards. In other words if you're here working, you'll have a card that you can't tamper with, that some document-forger can't foist off as a document for somebody to come and pick peaches here in Georgia. In other words, we've got a serious attempt in this bill -- and a real attempt -- to do what a lot of Americans want us to do, and that's enforce the border. If you're serious about keeping our economy strong, it makes sense to support legislation that gives foreign workers a legal path to jobs in America. There are people doing jobs here Americans aren't doing. The peach man said to me, he said, "I can't find somebody from my hometown who wants to pick peaches. But I can find somebody who wants to put food on their table for a family from, you know, Mexico, for example." It seems to me it makes sense to give those people a chance to come and work here on a temporary basis. This bill says temporary means temporary. "You'll be here for a number of years, and you'll go back home." That's what a temporary- worker plan does. In the meantime, it helps meet the needs of our economy. This bill is going to -- this aspect of the bill will allow federal agents to focus on apprehending violent criminals and terrorists who are a threat to our country rather than people who want to work here. In other words, if you can come to our country on a temporary basis legally, you're not going to sneak across the border. Who wants to pay a coyote hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars when you can walk across and say, "I'm going to have a temporary-work job here in this country. And here's my tamper -- you know, my tamper- resistant card." If you're interested in securing the border, wouldn't you rather have Border Patrol agents chasing down terrorists and gun runners and dope runners as opposed to people who are coming to do jobs Americans aren't doing? A temporary-worker plan that is truly temporary is going to make it easier for us to enforce the border. Border enforcement and having a rational worker plan go hand in hand. And that's what the American people have got to understand. A temporary-worker program will not begin until our border security measures are in place, and until we have a reliable system for verifying employment eligibility. That's the way the bill works. I'm sure you've heard some of the talk out there about people defining the bill. It's clear they haven't read the bill. BUSH: They're speculating about what the bill says and they're trying to rile up people's emotions. This is a good piece of legislation. It addresses the border security needs and it addresses the employment needs of our country. If you're serious about bringing hardworking illegal immigrants out of the shadows of our society, it makes sense to support legislation that will resolve their status without animosity and without amnesty. Oh, there's -- I don't -- they estimate 11 million to 12 million people have been here -- some quite a while -- who are in an underground in America. It's not right, far as I'm concerned. That's not what this country stands for. I know there are some people out there hollering and saying, "Kick 'em out." That is simply unrealistic. It won't work. There are some people saying, "Giving them automatic citizenship." I oppose that. It won't work. I don't think it -- I don't think it makes any sense to do that. Amnesty is forgiveness for being here without any penalties. That's what amnesty is. I oppose it. The authors -- many of the authors of this bill oppose it. This bill is not an amnesty bill. If you want to scare the American people, what you say is, "The bill's an amnesty bill." It's not an amnesty bill. That's empty political rhetoric trying to frighten our fellow citizens. People in Congress need the courage to go back to their districts and explain exactly what this bill is all about in order to put comprehensive immigration reform in place. Let me explain how it works. Under the bill, those who want to stay in our country who have been here can apply for a Z visa. At some point in time, those who are coming to work will get temporary work visas. Those who have been here already can apply for a Z visa. To receive the visa, illegal workers must admit they violated the law and pay a meaningful penalty, pass a strict background check, hold a job, maintain a clean record, and eventually earn English -- learn English. BUSH: That's how it works. It says, "If you want to be here, here's what you have to do." There is a consequence for having broken the law. As a result of a recent Senate amendment, they have to pay back taxes if they hadn't paid taxes, too. You're working hard. You pay taxes. People who have been here in this country ought to pay taxes, that's what it says. The hurdles to citizenship are going to be even higher. In other words, if somebody says, "Fine, I'll take my Z visa, I'm out of the shadows now, I've got an opportunity to, you know, not hide in America, I'm going to continue doing the work I'm doing, I'm going to keep my record clean, I'll pay the penalties necessary so I can stay here." That's what it says. But if you want to be a citizen, there's more hurdles. It says the Z visa worker would first have to pay an additional fine. In other words, "You have broken the law and there's a consequence for breaking the law"; that's what the bill says. Secondly, you've got to return home to file an application for your green card. If you want to be a citizen, you pay a fine, you touch base home to apply for a green card, and then you take your place behind those who've played by the rules and have been waiting in line patiently to become a citizen. It's a good bill. It recognizes that we've got to treat people with respect, and it also recognizes we're a nation of laws. And as we go forward, the legislation creates a new system for admitting new immigrants to our country, people who want to come here legally. The system's going to reward applicants based upon skills and education, in addition to family ties, so we can ensure America continues to have the world's most talented workforce. This legislation is also going to help newcomers assimilate into our society. One of the great aspects of American society is people have been able to assimilate. You know, I was at the Coast Guard Academy the other day, and giving a speech there, and the president of the class, a Latino, talked with great pride in his voice about the fact that his grandfather was a migrant to the United States of America, and here he is addressing the Coast Guard Academy. BUSH: I think it speaks volumes about the great promise of America. One of the reasons why is because his family assimilated into our society and into our culture. They key to unlocking the full promise of America is the ability to speak English. That's the language of our country. If you can speak English in this country and work hard and have dreams, you can make it. That's the great story of America. I believe it's true today like it was true yesterday as well. We expect opportunities to help -- we will expand opportunities to help new immigrants learn the language, learn about the ideals that make us a wonderful country. If you're serious about reform, it makes sense to support comprehensive legislation that addresses all aspects of the problem. You cannot solve the problem unless we address all aspects of the problem at the same time. This reform's complex. There's a lot of emotions around this issue. Convictions run deep. Those determined to find fault with this bill will always be able to look at a narrow slice of it and find something they don't like. If you want to kill the bill, if you don't want to do what's right for America, you can pick one little aspect out of it. You can use it to frighten people. Or you can show leadership and solve this problem once and for all so the people who wear the uniform in this crowd can do the job we expect them to do. Now's the time for comprehensive immigration reform. Now's the time for members of both political parties to stand up and show courage and take a leadership role and do what's right for America. Thanks for letting me come by. And God bless.

The soldiers were killed in two separate attacks in the past week, the Department of Defense said in news releases Wednesday. Staff Sgt. Thomas M. McFall, 36, of Glendora, Calif., and Cpl. Junior Cedeno Sanchez, 20, of Miami, died Monday when an explosive detonated nearby during a dismounted patrol in Baghdad. Both were assigned to 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, one of two Fort Lewis Stryker brigades serving in Iraq. On Saturday, Pfc. Charles B. Hester, 23, of Cataldo, Idaho, died in Baghdad when his vehicle was hit by a homemade bomb. Hester was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment with the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, Fort Lewis' other Stryker Brigade Combat Team that has been in Iraq since June. Hester had been in the Army three years, joining in May 2004. He arrived at Fort Lewis in September 2004, where he was assigned to the 3rd Brigade. McFall joined the Army in October 1994 and served a year in Korea beginning February 1997. He then reported to Fort Lewis to serve with the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment. In April 2001, McFall was stationed at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and deployed to Afghanistan with the 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment from April 2004 through March 2005. He returned to Fort Lewis that September and had served since January with the 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment. Sanchez joined the Army in November 2005 and reported to Fort Lewis last June for assignment to the 4th Brigade's 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry. The unit left for Iraq last month. He was posthumously promoted from the rank of private first class. The deaths came as Fort Lewis leaders said they would no longer be holding individual memorial services for soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, a move other military posts have already taken. "As much as we would like to think otherwise, I am afraid that with the number of soldiers we now have in harm's way, our losses will preclude us from continuing to do individual memorial ceremonies," Brig. Gen. William Troy, acting commanding general at Fort Lewis, wrote in a May 22 memo to commanders and staff. A copy of the memo was obtained by United for Peace Pierce County and posted on the group's Web site. Troy asked the post's senior chaplain, Col. Jack Van Dyken, to work out the details of the new policy set to begin next month. There are about 8,000 Fort Lewis-based soldiers in Iraq. "This is not an intent to streamline the process or in any way detract from honoring the soldiers," Van Dyken told The News Tribune on Tuesday. "It's just being cognizant of the fact that when you have this many, the time involved in doing each one individually is just prohibitive." "I see this as a way of sharing the heavy burdens our spouses and rear detachments bear, while giving our fallen warriors the respect they deserve," Troy wrote in his memo. "It will also give the families of the fallen the opportunity to bond with one another, as they see others who share their grief." A total of 127 Fort Lewis soldiers have died in all overseas deployments since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. This month alone, the post has held five memorials for troops killed in Iraq, including one for six soldiers killed in a single attack May 6 in Baqubah. The 4th Brigade is planning a June 5 memorial for four soldiers killed in its first month in Iraq: Staff Sgts. David Kuehl and Kristopher Higdon, Pfc. Robert Worthington and Spc. Mathew LaForest. Other Army posts already consolidating soldier memorials include Fort Carson, Colo., and Fort Hood in Texas.

An amendment to add Carson's name to an omnibus street-naming bill was defeated by a vote of 25 to 15, with seven abstentions and four members absent. As votes go in the usually lockstep Council, it was one of the narrowest in many years. And despite the Council's racial diversity, onlyone white Council member - Tony Avella (D-Queens) - voted with the losing pro-Carson side. Similarly, only one nonwhite Council member, Sara Gonzales (D-Brooklyn), sided with thewinning anti-Carson side, led bySpeaker Christine Quinn (D-Manhattan). The seven who abstained all belonged to the Council's 25-member Black, Latino and Asian Caucus. By abstaining, they strengthened Quinn's hand in the showdown vote. Quinn said she would fire any aide who pressured any member on their vote, and she made a no-retaliation vow against members who voted against her position. She argued that honorary street namings are a collective Council decision and should be reserved for individuals who brought the city together. She said Carson had "a record that is without apology a divisive record." She drew an unusual personal attack from Councilman Charles Barron (D-Brooklyn), the most vociferous supporter for naming a section of Gates Ave. in Bedford-Stuyvesant after Carson. Gesturing with his right index finger at Quinn, Barron said, "You have divided us more than Sonny Carson ever divided any people anywhere."

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Texas House Speaker Beats Back Rebellion Tuesday, May 29, 2007; 2:57 AM AUSTIN, Texas -- After last-minute budget squabbles and an attempted rebellion against House Speaker Tom Craddick, the Legislature stumbled to the finish line early Tuesday without a change at the top. The Senate adjourned in the early evening, and the House went until the midnight deadline with a last-ditch round of tense debate over water, border security and electric deregulation. Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick, R-Midland, sits near a portrait of Sam Houston and listens as speakers call for him to resign during the evening session in the Texas House of Representatives early Monday, May 28, 2007, in Austin, Texas. Opposition to House Speaker Tom Craddick exploded early Monday as dozens of Democrats and Republicans who want him to leave office walked out of the chamber in protest. (AP Photo/Harry Cabluck) (Harry Cabluck - AP) In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article The embattled Craddick finished the 140-day session as the man in charge of the House. He cocked his head back and laughed as he chatted with some Republican supporters in the House chamber toward the end of the day. Democrats and Republicans alike complain that Craddick has ruled with an iron fist. They say his win-at-all-cost style often forces them to vote against the interests of their own districts. Opponents tried all weekend to oust him from power, with no success. Craddick refused to allow the opposition bring up a motion for a vote to "vacate the chair." Craddick is currently the longest-serving House member and the first Republican speaker since Reconstruction, having taken over in 2003 after the GOP won a majority of House seats. Frustrated by their failed attempts to overthrow Craddick, dozens of angry House members stormed out of the chamber in protest in the early morning hours Monday. "This man is sitting here violating every rule of the House, every rule of parliamentary procedure to keep himself in office, and it's wrong," said Rep. Pat Haggerty, a Republican. A prepared statement from Craddick's office chided those it said were trying to divert the House from important matters and trying to drag lawmakers into a speaker's race. Despite some 11th-hour fights and threats in the Senate to filibuster the budget bill, the House and Senate signed off late Sunday night and early Monday on a compromise $153 billion two-year spending plan, the state's largest ever.

In a release updating lawmakers on its investigation, the department said it also was looking into hiring practices within its Civil Rights division. Lawmakers have questioned whether the division has hired prosecutors with strong political resumes but little civil rights experience. The Boston Globe, citing a letter the department's internal watchdogs sent yesterday to Congress, says the probes mark an expansion of the ongoing investigation into the removal of eight U.S. attorneys in December. "Among the issues that we intend to investigate are allegations regarding Monica Goodling's and others' actions in DOJ hiring and personnel decisions; allegations concerning hiring for the DOJ Honors Program and Summer Law Intern Program; and allegations concerning hiring practices in the DOJ Civil Rights Division," the letter says, according to the paper.

Antiwar icon pulls out of movement Sheehan voices frustration on new Congress Peace activist Cindy Sheehan, whose son, Casey, was killed in Iraq, led a group of protesters toward President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, on April 6. They were prevented by police from meeting with Bush to ask him to end the war. (Jason Reed/Reuters/file) By Susan Milligan, Globe Staff | WASHINGTON -- Cindy Sheehan, who became an icon of the antiwar movement after she set up a protest camp near President Bush's Texas home, said yesterday that she would resign as the "face" of the movement out of frustration with a Democratic-led Congress unable -- or unwilling -- to get the United States out of Iraq. In an online diary entry laden with sadness and bitterness, Sheehan said she could no longer sustain the full-time antiwar effort she mounted after her son, Casey, was killed in Iraq in 2004. "Casey died for a country which cares more about who will be the next American Idol than how many people will be killed in the next few months while Democrats and Republicans play politics with human lives," Sheehan wrote on the Daily Kos, a liberal blog. "It is so painful to me to know that I bought into this system for so many years and Casey paid the price for that allegiance. I failed my boy and that hurts the most." Sheehan's decision reflects a growing frustration among antiwar activists, who hoped that the new, Democratic-run Congress would force the United States out of the war. But after a failed effort to impose a schedule for troop withdrawals, Congress voted last week to approve about $100 billion for the war effort. "There's anger out there," said Representative James McGovern , Democrat of Worcester and author of a measure to withdraw US troops within six months. "I think maybe there was an expectation that was not totally unreasonable, that somehow the Democrats would be able to end this [war] quickly once they won" control of Congress, he said. "I wish that was the case." Many Democrats -- including the entire Massachusetts congressional delegation and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Democrat of California -- opposed the war-funding measure, saying they could not vote to fund a war that they are determined to end. Democrats did not have enough votes to force Bush to accept a measure imposing a phased withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, a measure Bush vetoed May 1 and vowed to veto again and again if Congress kept sending it to his desk. But antiwar forces said they were disappointed with Democrats for not standing up to the president -- a complaint Sheehan expressed in her parting diary entry. "Blind party loyalty is dangerous whatever side it occurs on," Sheehan said, noting that she endured "slurs" from the left when she criticized Democrats as well as Republicans on the war. "If someone looks, dresses, acts, talks and votes like a Republican, then why do they deserve support just because he/she calls him/herself a Democrat?" Sheehan said. Antiwar activists initially focused their criticism on Bush and GOP backers of the war. But in the past months they have targeted Democrats as well, accusing them of lacking the political will to simply refuse to approve any money to pay for the war. "They're basically funding George Bush's work," said Tina Richards of Salem, Mo., who successfully fought to prevent her war-wounded son from being sent to Iraq a third time. Richards herself was in a verbal scuffle in March with Representative David Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, when she approached the lawmaker about cutting off funds for the war in Iraq. Representative Michael Capuano , Democrat of Somerville and a longtime foe of the war, said antiwar forces need to keep the pressure on GOP lawmakers to force a change in Iraq policy. "In some ways, she's an American hero," Capuano said of Sheehan. "I hope the message she is sending now is not, 'If I don't get my way in the time frame I want, I'll pick up my marbles and go home.' If that's going to be the case for the antiwar movement, we'll be in Iraq for generations," Capuano said. Sheehan camped out near Bush's Crawford, Texas, home for 26 days during the president's August 2005 vacation, demanding to talk to Bush about the death of her son in Iraq. Subsequently, Sheehan became a globe-trotting opponent of the war, drawing plaudits from antiwar activists and derision from critics who called her a pawn of the left and criticized her for meeting with leftist Venezuelan president Hugo Ch&#xE1;vez , a Bush nemesis. "In some ways, she's served her purpose. But because of the radical politics she adopted, she's marginalized herself with her former allies in the Democratic party," said Kristinn Taylor, a spokesman for , a conservative blog that has featured critical comments about Sheehan over the years. "The biggest concern a lot of us had -- outside her radical politics -- was that they were keeping her in a perpetual cycle of anger. They weren't letting her heal," Taylor said. Sheehan's compatriots wished her well and said they would continue the fight to stop the war. "The [congressional] leaders don't get it. They think they're going to be tarred with the 'weak on defense brush' " or be accused of not supporting the troops if they refuse to pay for the war, said Ellen Barfield , an Army veteran active in Veterans for Peace. "We just have to keep pushing them," she said. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company. All Globe stories since 2003 are now FREE E-mail to a friend The New York Times Company

East Bay Daily News Redwood City Daily News San Mateo Daily News Victor Maccharoli / Daily News file Burlingame residents crowded around the Broadway Grill on Wednesday afternoon to shake hands and talk to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Downtown campaign stop thrills supporters, detractors alike By Will Oremus / Daily News Staff Writer Dan and Laura Escobar and their 6-year-old daughter Ella got to the Broadway Grill in Burlingame at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday to get a good seat for a rare Peninsula public appearance by Republican presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani. It was well after 11 a.m., the grill was teeming with media types and the Escobars were nursing their last sips of coffee when the popular New Yorker at last swept in with his entourage. With cameras whirring, the candidate briefly sat down with the Escobars, smiled and said he was glad to meet them -- and then he was off to the next table. He was gone too fast for Laura Escobar to snap a picture of the former mayor with Ella, but Escobar said the encounter was still a thrill. "We're definitely fans." Giuliani, who is polling as the leading Republican in the newly important California primary, talked to locals about border security and taxes in his whirlwind visit to Burlingame. But mostly the event was about face time with voters and the local press. Sitting down at a table next to Mike DeMaria and Nicholas Fleres, athletic coaches at Burlingame High School, Giuliani fielded an unscripted question about Barry Bonds' pursuit of Hank Aaron's baseball home run record. The candidate, a famous New York Yankees fan, declined to bash the slugger for his rumored steroid use, saying diplomatically, "Records are meant to be broken." Burlingame residents generally gave Giuliani a warm welcome, cheering his entrance and congregating outside the restaurant's windows and on the Broadway sidewalks to see him. Several identified themselves as die-hard supporters, including some who said they are New York transplants. Mike Murray, a Democrat who was eating at the grill Wednesday, said he doesn't much like Giuliani; he'd prefer Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn. But he was drawn to the novelty of having a big-time Republican candidate in liberal San Mateo County. As Giuliani worked the crowd on the right-hand side of the Broadway Grill, Murray heckled, "Hey Mr. Mayor, are you afraid to come over here to the left side of the room?" Burlingame Council Member Ann Keighran, also a registered Democrat, said a public stop from a figure like Giuliani is a good thing for the city regardless of politics: "It puts Broadway on the map." After making the rounds inside, Giuliani stepped onto the sidewalk for a brief press conference in which he struck at leading Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for advocating higher taxes. He said his own plan to get rid of the estate tax and cut capital gains taxes would stimulate the Silicon Valley economy. As he headed toward his limousine to scoot over to a private fundraiser at the Burlingame Hyatt, Giuliani stopped to greet a few final residents. The Escobars, now running hours late to take Ella to school, seized the moment and got the candidate to take the 6-year-old blonde into his arms for a photo. "Now at least it'll be easier to explain to the school why she wasn't there," Laura Escobar said. E-mail Will Oremus at woremus@dailynewsgroup.com.

House votes to legalize medical use of marijuana HARTFORD &#151; The House of Representatives, after six hours of debate that touched on many lawmakers' own experiences with debilitating illness, approved a bill Wednesday that would legalize the medical use of marijuana for certain patients. The bill passed on a 89-58 vote. It moves to the Senate, where a similar bill passed in 2005. That bill then failed in the House. Rep. Toni Boucher, R-Wilton, tried in vain to change the bill. She had filed about 50 amendments, but called only eight. They ranged from requiring the Department of Agriculture to set up a pilot program for medical marijuana patients to providing local police departments with the names of people using the drug for palliative purposes. "This should not be compared with other medications that doctors prescribe," said Boucher, who warned lawmakers they are embarking on "a dangerous direction." She voted against it. Connecticut lawmakers have grappled with the issue for the last five years. Supporters say it's needed to legally protect people who try to obtain the illegal drug to help stem the draining effects of diseases such as cancer and multiple sclerosis. Tribune's deal to sell some papers to Gannett called off CHICAGO &#151; Tribune Co. disclosed Friday afternoon that its earlier agreement to sell two Connecticut newspapers to Gannett Co. for $73 million has been called off in the wake of an unfavorable arbitrator's ruling regarding Gannett's plan not to honor an existing union contract at one of the papers. Tribune announced in March that it had agreed to sell the Advocate in Stamford and the Greenwich Time to Gannett, which is based in McLean, Va. Nearly 40 of the editorial employees at the Advocate are represented by the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America union; when Gannett said it did not plan to honor the contract with the unionized reporters and photographers, the workers got a federal judge to temporarily block the sale of the operations, pending an arbitrator's ruling. Last month, the arbitrator ruled that Tribune couldn't sell the company unless the buyer agreed to assume the existing union contract as a condition of the sale. Gannett declined to do so, however, and on Friday the two companies announced the deal had been terminated. Tribune, which is in the process of going private through a heavily leveraged $8.2 billion transaction, said it will "immediately" begin soliciting new offers for the two newspapers. Tribune owns the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, WGN-Ch. 9 and other media properties. Norwich soldier dies in helicopter crash in Iraq NORWICH &#151; The month of May is ending as the deadliest month of the year for U.S. troops in Iraq. That grim reality hit home for a Norwich family, who learned their son was killed when his helicopter crashed on Memorial day. Army 1st Lt. Keith Heidtman, 24, was the 37th military member with Connecticut ties to die since the war began in 2002. Two Connecticut civilians have also been killed. "It's all a shock to us," said Chris Heidtman, the soldier's uncle. Heidtman was one of 10 U.S. soldiers who died in roadside bombings and the helicopter crash on Monday, the military reported. As of late Tuesday, there were at least 113 U.S. deaths in Iraq so far in May, with two days left in the month. Eight of the soldiers were from Task Force Lightning &#151; six killed when explosions hit near their vehicles and two in a helicopter crash. The military did not say if the helicopter was shot down or had mechanical problems. Heidtman was a 2001 graduate of Norwich Free Academy and a graduate of the University of Connecticut. His parents were notified Tuesday morning. He was the son of Kerry Heidtman and Maureen Robidoux. His stepfather is Art Robidoux. "If you had to pick your son, this is who you would pick. He was handsome, he was bright," Chris Heidtman said. Heidtman arrived in Iraq in December and was scheduled to come home for leave in July. "We're sending our finest, and we're losing them," Chris Heidtman said. Gov. M. Jodi Rell ordered all state and U.S. flags lowered to half staff in Heidtman's honor. "Lt. Heidtman made the ultimate sacrifice for all of us, and he did so to protect the freedom that we so often take for granted," Rell said in a statement. "To have given his life on Memorial Day is especially poignant." Funeral arrangements have not been announced. Mail to a friend

Lake Okeechobee hits record low fire in dry bed still burns (Last updated: 10:35 AM) MIAMI (AP) - Lake Okeechobee's water levels dropped to a record low today, the result of months of lower-than-normal rainfall levels that have afflicted the main backup water supply for 5 million South Florida residents. Plus a fire in a northwest dry riverbed is still burning. The incendiary fire started Monday in Buckhead Ridge in Glades County, but is not under control. It is sending smoke westward and has covered parts of Charlotte County. The South Florida Water Management District reported a record low of 8.94 feet, surpassing the mark of 8.97 feet set during a 2001 drought and tied Wednesday. The region's drought is leading water managers to assess how to best protect drinking water supplies, meet needs of the important agriculture industry and protect natural resources. The average water level should be around 13 feet this time of year in the second-largest freshwater lake in the contiguous United States. "There is no joy over this record-breaking event," said Carol Ann Wehle, the district's executive director. Record keeping on the lake's levels began in 1931. Lake Okeechobee is also the liquid heart of the Everglades. South Florida is largely dependent on the 730-square-mile lake during dry periods, when it can be used as a reservoir if water wells from underground aquifers get too low. Rainfall directly over the lake has been low enough to qualify this drought as a one-in-100-year event, the district said. Just 40 inches of rain have fallen on the region in the past 18 months, about half the average amount, water managers said. There is some possibility of rain this afternoon coming in from the Gulf of Mexico and chances of rain rise as the week goes on. The rain chance is 70 percent on Saturday, experts said. The area around the lake could get up to 1 1/2 inches of rain in the next two or three days, the National Weather Service in Miami said. The dry conditions have exposed vegetation that normally sits on the lake bottom. A 23-square-mile 15,000 acre fire started Monday in the dried-out vegetation in the lake's northwest rim. The fire was 75 percent contained today, and a voluntary evacuation for a mobile home park was called off. The fire in Babcock Ranch has broken 7,000 acres and is still 90 percent contained as it has been all week. That lightning fire is off State Road 31 behind Fire Station #9. There are no structures in danger, the Division of Forestry reported. The drought has forced stringent water restrictions on homes and businesses in 13 counties, and four coastal wells were closed to prevent saltwater contamination.

Heidtman had many opportunities. But it was a time of war, and he felt like he had to do his part, relatives said. So, like his grandparents in World War II, he joined the Army. On Monday, five months after deploying to a base in Tikrit, the 24-year-old first lieutenant from Norwich, Conn., died when the OH-58D Kiowa helicopter he was piloting came under heavy fire and crashed. One crewman also died in the crash, and six servicemen who attempted to rescue the crash victims were killed by enemy fire. As of May 30, 3,459 US servicemen have died in Iraq, according to the Pentagon. We were totally against him joining the military, but it was something he always wanted to do, and we supported him, said Arthur Robidoux, his stepfather. I think he had more maturity than I had, and Im twice his age. He was very mature, very goal oriented. He was well loved and well respected by a lot of people. Born and raised in Norwich, Heidtman graduated from the Norwich Free Academy, where he played first base on the baseball team and guard on the basketball team, in 2001, his parents said. He studied resource economics at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, they said. As a college junior in 2004, Heidtman enlisted in the campus ROTC program. When he graduated the following year, he went to boot camp and then the US Army Aviation Warfighting Center in Fort Rucker, Alabama, where he learned to be a helicopter pilot. Relatives said he was motivated to join the Army, in part, by the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. He wanted to serve his country and make a difference, said Jeffrey Cassis, his uncle. Im really proud of him, but its also quite a tragedy. He had a whole life ahead of him. I really miss him. Wanted to make a difference Posted by the Boston Globe City & Region Desk at E-mail to a friend More news updates from The Boston Globe The New York Times Company

Though military sources had not yet provided details, the family of Army 1st Lt. Keith Heidtman said they were told he died Monday when his helicopter went down in the volatile Diyala province northeast of Baghdad. As Heidtman's family learned of the 24-year-old's death, news was emerging from Iraq about the incident. The U.S. military on Tuesday announced the loss of a Kiowa helicopter - a small, highly maneuverable scouting and attack aircraft with two aboard. As a ground rescue team raced toward the scene, its vehicles were hit by roadside bombs, killing six more soldiers. Two other soldiers were killed Monday by a roadside bomb in south Baghdad, the military reported. The 116 deaths reported by i-casualities.org, a website that compiles statistics about the war in Iraq, makes this month among the worst of the war. The site also gives the latest total count of U.S. fatalities at 3,468. Heidtman's family and friends struggled Tuesday with the news that they had lost a son, brother, baseball player and college graduate. The family issued a statement, saying they were devastated by the loss but "proud of his service to his country." "We support what he wanted to do," said his stepfather, Arthur Robidoux. They also wanted to say they were glad for the support already pouring in. Their day was hectic, Robidoux said - "mentally and physically trying." Keith Heidtman, the son of Kerry Heidtman and Maureen Robidoux, graduated six years ago from the Norwich Free Academy. Hugh "Duke" Campbell, a principal there, was his assistant baseball coach. "It's tragic news for all of us," Campbell said. Campbell knew Heidtman since he was a boy coming to baseball camps and remembers him as the hard-working first baseman and outfielder who hit .371 one year. On Tuesday, he sat looking at a letter of recommendation he had written for the pending grad in 2000, when Heidtman was applying to the University of Connecticut. It opened: "Keith Heidtman represents everything that is right about young people today. He brings the whole package to the table every day." Heidtman graduated two years ago from UConn with honors. His education also included ROTC - the four-year training program to become a military officer. "He showed up in my office one day," said Maj. Glenn Colby, enrollment officer there. "He wanted to serve his country," Colby said. "You couldn't ask for a better kid." Last year, Heidtman had another graduation - from an Army aviation school in Alabama. And then, six months ago, he was in Iraq. As Memorial Day approached, Task Force Lightning was working northeast of Baghdad in one of Iraq's more unsettled regions. The commander of U.S. forces there, Maj. Gen. Benjamin Mixon, said earlier this month that Diyala province's government is nonfunctional and that he would need additional forces in Diyala "to get that situation to a more acceptable level." Seventeen days later, on Monday, eight of his soldiers were killed in this single incident. A spokesman with the Connecticut National Guard, which is usually assigned to assist Connecticut families like Heidtman's in the casualty process, said his office isn't allowed to talk about such casualties in the first 24 hours after the family is notified. But as she has so many times, Gov. M. Jodi Rell on Tuesday ordered that the state's flags fly at half-staff until the burial. From the Multi-National Force Iraq, a brief notice: "Two Task Force Lightning soldiers were killed when a helicopter went down in Diyala province May 28. The incident is under investigation." Heidtman isn't the first former student of Norwich Free Academy killed in Iraq. That was Spec. Jacob D. Martir, shot in Sadr City in 2004. Nor was he the first ROTC graduate from UConn to fall. Capt. Jason Hamill was killed in Iraq just a few weeks before Heidtman got there. Contact Jesse Hamilton at jhamilton@courant.com. Interact with The Courant: Reader Rep.

It&#8217;s a lesson we never quite learned, given that our best PR tool is this website: We write about people in the media, and people in the media write about us! It&#8217;s brilliant, and we&#8217;re gonna make a mint on it someday. In the meantime, it might do the rest of you good to start brushing up on how to get reporters interested in whatever you&#8217;re pitching. Enter Bill Stoller&#8217;s Publicity Insider Update , an &#8220;eZine&#8221; (yes, seriously!) that started pumping its way into our inbox. It bills itself as a mailer &#8220;about publicity, PR &#038; promotions for businesses, entrepreneurs &#038; PR/Marketing Folk,&#8221; but is, essentially, a crack dealer; they give readers a free taste of what they can offer, but you&#8217;ve got to pay for the real thing. For us, however, it&#8217;s a mailer about how it&#8217;s indeed possible the make the PR industry look even more like a self-serving industry for sociopaths. &raquo; Post A Comment Bill Stoller's Publicity Insider Update David Zinczenko Jeopardizes His Career The 'Z Man's' Abs Book Yields A Shout-Out From Alex Trebek, Attracts New 'Old Lady And Bored College Kids' Demographic &raquo; Post a Comment Did you hear the news? Dave Zinczenko has extended his omnipresence to include the realm of television game shows! The Men&#8217;s Health editor in chief appeared on &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; Tuesday night, but not as one of the contestants â he was the &#8220;answer&#8221; to a Double Jeopardy question in a category on books on nutrition. &#8220;David Zinczenko, editor of Men&#8217;s Health Magazine, wrote a diet book named for these not always washboard muscles,&#8221; read the clue. Contestant and four-day &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; champion Mehrun Etebari answered the $400 question correctly (&#8221;What are abs?&#8221;), and took home $37,900 in winnings for the day. &#8220;This proves once again that abs are the answer to everything,&#8221; Zinczenko joked Wednesday. And lest you somehow think Dave&#8217;s hardworking publicist had anything to do with this, WWD assures us that questions are &#8220;crafted internally by a staff of nine writers and eight researchers.&#8221; However, more surprising than the fact that Zincenko has suddenly become pop trivia was the banal nature of the question. &raquo; Post A Comment &#8220;My Husband&#8217;s Been Kidnapped&#8221; Stunt Is Merely a Disgusting Court TV Marketing Ploy No need to think there's a wife who really lost her husband or anything &raquo; Post a Comment Visitors logging on to would be hard pressed to miss the &#8220;Court TV, Seriously Entertaining&#8221; bulletin board item on the homepage.

Santa Fe / NM 'Bewusstseinslage' and more: National spelling bee begins Joseph Henares, 14, of Avon, Conn., reacts after spelling his word correctly in the preliminary round of the Scripps 2007 Spelling Bee in Washington, Wednesday, May 30, 2007. (AP Photo/Lawrence Jackson) By JOSEPH WHITE | Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) _ The start of the 80th Scripps National Spelling Bee on Wednesday resembled a classroom of students taking the SAT as 286 youngsters from the English-speaking world filled in ovals with their No. 2 pencils. Along with the 25-word, multiple-choice spelling test, they were also given their only guaranteed moment on the Grand Hyatt's ballroom stage: a chance to spell one word before an audience of parents, friends and judges. "Macaroni _ what does it mean?" asked 14-year-old Michael Yeh of Kokomo, Ind., exercising his right to ask for a definition before correctly spelling the popular kids' food often served with cheese. The multiple choice test (worth 25 points) and the preliminary oral round (worth three points) served to narrow the field to 90 or so spellers, who advanced to the quarterfinals Wednesday afternoon. The semifinals and finals take place Thursday, with the champion crowned in prime time on ABC for the second consecutive year. The winner receives $35,000 cash, a $5,000 scholarship, a $2,500 savings bond and a complete set of reference works. The oral round was hardly taxing for the top spellers. Tia Thomas, 12, of Coarsegold, Calif., back for her fourth national bee, correctly spelled "flagrant." The audience laughed when pronouncer Jacques Bailly defined "ninety" as "being one more than 89" for 13-year-old Mary Harrington of Vineyard Haven, Mass. Aishwarya Pastapur of Overland Park, Kansas, made her feelings known by wearing a T-shirt with the words "mishpelt werds eeritate me." She displayed no irritation whatsoever by correctly spelling "enumerated." Kate Weir, 13, of Christchurch, New Zealand, traveled far to participate, and she must have felt the wait was even longer when she was kept at the microphone while the judges conferred over her Kiwi-accented spelling of "eeriness." Her spelling was eventually replayed over the loudspeakers before it was declared correct. There were a few flubs, however. Ten-year-old Seher Sethi of Rhinebeck, N.Y., let out a sigh after misspelling "pallbearer." Christian Wilks, 10, of Freeport, Ill., tried to put an "a'' and an extra "l'' in "felony." During the breaks, the ballroom was vibrant with spellers who have become fast friends during their short time in Washington _ and some who have formed a camaraderie over the years. Matthew Evans, a 12-year-old from Albuquerque, N.M., who is also appearing for the fourth time, excitedly compared notes with Tia following the multiple choice test. Matthew said he got 24 correct. "My favorite word was actually word No. 25!" Matthew exclaimed. And what is that word? "Bewusstseinslage," he said, defining it as state of consciousness and pronounced bay-VOOHST-seins-lahg-eh. And why is it his favorite word? "Just because it's so weird sounding." Thirteen-year-old Samir Patel of Colleyville, Texas, was scheduled to take part in the morning's final oral round. Samir has finished third, 27th, second and 14th in his four national bees and is considered by many the favorite to win. "I feel I've been trying my hardest for the last few years and it hasn't worked out," Samir said. "But life is not completely about the spelling bee and I've learned to realize that. But I will be very disappointed if I don't win."

Skip to next paragraph Speaker Tom Craddick listened Tuesday below a portrait of Sam Houston as legislators urged him to quit. , added, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad the legislators are leaving town so that there is time for wounds to heal.&#8221; Despite the strife, lawmakers reached agreement on a number of issues, beyond passage of the two-year $153 billion budget. They mandated random steroid testing for high school athletes. They strengthened the right of Texans to carry handguns, without a license, in their vehicles. They gave a final failing grade to the little-loved statewide high school exams known as TAKS, phasing them out starting in 2011. They refused to tinker with the formula that guarantees college entry to the top 10 percent of each high school&#8217;s graduates, which began as an equal opportunity measure but is opposed by some educators as tying the hands of admissions officers. And they declared the blind salamander the official state amphibian. Ending their 140-day odd-year occupation of the capital, members of the State Senate and the House of Representatives, both controlled by Republicans, began streaming home with emotions raw from an unusual effort to unseat Speaker Tom Craddick, Republican of Midland, over complaints of autocratic abuses. Late Friday, lawmakers rushed the podium in an effort to force Mr. Craddick out of office. Representative Garnet F. Coleman, Democrat of Houston, said Monday that the events had historical implications. &#8220;It sends the message,&#8221; Mr. Coleman said, &#8220;that in a representative democracy, the people have a voice through their representatives, and no one individual has absolute power.&#8221; Mr. Craddick dismissed the uprising by dissidents in both parties as a coup attempt, and vowed to remain in office. He prevailed early Saturday after refusing to recognize members seeking a vote on his removal, prompting the House parliamentarian to quit. But members stormed out in protest again on Monday. Another fight erupted over efforts to require prospective voters to show a photo ID, which Republicans promoted as a way to curb election fraud, and Democrats resisted as a burden intended to suppress the Democratic vote. As the rancor grew, the office of Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a Republican, released an open letter insulting the dean of the Senate, John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat (and a hunting buddy of Mr. Dewhurst.) Later, quipping that he feared going out with an armed foe, Mr. Dewhurst said his staff members had put out the letter in error. He reissued it minus the offending references. Soon after, the voter ID measure was blocked in the Senate when a Houston Democrat, Mario Gallegos Jr., recovering from a liver transplant, moved his hospital bed into a Senate antechamber to be on hand for crucial votes. Among the more noteworthy actions of the session was the overwhelming vote to thwart Mr. Perry&#8217;s executive order requiring vaccinations of sixth-grade girls against the sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer. Although the order included an opt-out clause for parents, lawmakers condemned the governor&#8217;s action as an overstepping of executive authority. But lawmakers authorized a $3 billion bond measure, to be presented to voters in November, to finance grants of $300 million a year for 10 years to Texas institutions for cancer research. They also voted to restore coverage to 127,000 low-income children under the state health insurance program. The measure also eliminated a 90-day waiting period, allowed parents to register for a year at a time instead of six months and eased other restrictions. &#8220;This was a step in the right direction and a hard-fought victory for Texas children,&#8221; said Renee Wizig-Barrios, lead organizer in Houston for the Industrial Areas Foundation, a community organizing group. Reflecting growing unease over Mr. Perry&#8217;s proposed Trans-Texas Corridor, a vast toll road and rail link from Oklahoma to Mexico, legislators imposed a two-year moratorium on other toll-road contracts. The governor could veto some of the bills. In measures against crime, legislators added $200 million for more law enforcement officers and toughened the law against sexual predators of children, adding a death penalty for second offenders. Environmental groups praised the lawmakers&#8217; measures to encourage energy efficiency but denounced missed chances to control coal plant emissions. &#8220;While there was some progress on energy efficiency and renewable energy,&#8221; said Cyrus Reed, a lobbyist for the , &#8220;the Legislature left the plan in place for industry to increase tons of pollutants into the Texas air in coming years.&#8221; Some measures sailed through. A concurrent resolution of the House declared Athens, Tex., &#8220;the original home of one of the nation&#8217;s favorite foods, the hamburger.&#8221; (But don&#8217;t try putting that up for a vote in Louis&#8217; Lunch in New Haven, Conn., which makes the same claim.)

The agency on Tuesday announced its new fee schedule and the July 30 deadline. Some of the fees will more than double after the deadline. For instance, filing for permanent residency, or a "green card," will cost $1,010, including biometric fees -- the fees for fingerprinting, photographing and capturing the signatures of applicants -- up from $395. Filing for citizenship will cost $675, up from $400. A complete fee list is available at www.uscis.gov. Immigrant advocates expected a rush of immigrant filing petitions in the next two months to avoid the higher fees. Clara Lugo, a permanent resident and a scheduler for a doctor's office in El Paso, said the new fee structure motivated her to file for naturalization after 25 years in the United States. "I've been procrastinating. My family is always telling me so. Even my dad became a citizen already. I've never felt the urge. But this is it. This is my deadline," she said. Overall, the fee increases are not as high as had been proposed earlier, partly because of a review of more than 3,900 public comments, many of which were critical, agency officials said. "We proposed our new fee structure with the expectation of ongoing discussions with the public on this important issue," said CIS Director Emilio Gonzalez in a written statement. "The volume and value of the comments we received has provided an opportunity to fine-tune our final fee structure that we believe is both fair to our customers and vital to our nation as we continue to build a secure and efficient national immigration service." For instance, filing for permanent residency for a child under 14 filing with his family will cost $360 less than proposed. But it will still be $600 per child, in addition to the $1,010 per parent. "I still worry that a lot of people are not going to be able to afford these fees. A lot of people who are eligible for benefits are simply not going to apply. Right now the number one reason for not applying for benefits is the fees," said Iliana Holguin, executive director of the Diocesan Migrant and Refugee Services of El Paso. CIS officials said the fees are needed to improve service at the agency. Officials said that the new revenue would lead to a 20 percent reduction in average application processing times by the end of fiscal year 2009. Forms are now processed by a paper-based system. Part of the additional revenue from higher fees will be used to process applications electronically. Some will continue to be exempt from paying fees: victims of human trafficking, victims of violence against women, refugees, U.S. citizens filing for their immigrant spouses and members of the U.S. military. The biometric fees rise from $70 to $80, as proposed. Louie Gilot may be reached at lgilot@elpasotimes.com, 546-6131.

Reputed Klansman James Ford Seale is on trial in connection with the May 2, 1964, abduction and killings of Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles Eddie Moore. The 71-year-old former cropduster has pleaded not guilty to federal kidnapping and conspiracy charges. The jury pool, which started at 76 Wednesday morning, was reduced to 55 by Wednesday afternoon, all 21 being excused for hardships or other reasons. This morning, the judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers are quizzing potential jurors about publicity theyve witnessed. If more jurors are needed, Justice Department prosecutor Paige Fitzgerald said another panel will be called. Unlike in past trials, the potential jurors names are not being disclosed. The potential jurors were asked to make sure their names matched up with an assigned number. Fitzgerald sought the anonymous jury for the trial because she said Seale has participated in a group with the capacity to harm jurors. Seale has denied being affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan. The potential jurors were summoned from the 45 counties of the Southern District, which stretches from Holmes County in the north down to the Gulf Coast. Selection of a jury could take a week, a defense attorney said. Opening statements and testimony arent expected to begin until next week.

"Today" show co-host Matt Lauer and presidential hopeful Mitt Romney apologized yesterday for conducting an interview in a moving car without wearing their seat belts. "As we were driving in the car and talking, Governor Romney and I were not wearing our seat belts," Lauer said yesterday, immediately after the pretaped segment aired around 7:12 a.m. "As the guy who just interviewed Jon Corzine for that issue, I should have set a better example." Lauer noted that the interview took place in New Hampshire, where there is no seat-belt law - the pair were also sitting in the back seat, where adults in most states are exempt from the rule - but said that was no excuse. Romney also admitted he set a bad example, "and for that I apologize," he said in a statement. "Sometimes I forget to wear my seat belt. For my own safety, I need to keep reminding myself to buckle up," Romney said. After the apology, Lauer turned to Tim Russert, NBC&#39;s Washington bureau chief, to analyze the interview with the former Massachusetts governor. "Where do I send my dues to the dumb club?" Lauer joked. "Click it, Matt," Russert said. Lauer taped part of his "Today on the Trail" segment Tuesday as he and Romney drove between Alton and Laconia, N.H. At times, their caravan of cars reached 65 mph, according to reports. Lauer was the first major news personality to interview New Jersey Gov. Corzine earlier this month, following Corzine&#39;s near-death accident. Corzine was nearly killed April 12 after his speeding SUV crashed on the Garden State Parkway. The governor, who was unbelted at the time and sitting in the front seat, broke a leg, ribs and other bones.

Jury selection began yesterday in the trial of a former Klan member charged over the brutal 1960s murders of two young black civil rights activists in Mississippi. Former policeman James Seale, 71, has been charged with the May 1964 kidnapping of Henry Dee and Charles Moore, both 19. It's alleged Mr Seale and others beat the teens to make them confess to weapons smuggling, then lashed them to an engine and a piece of rail and threw them into the Mississippi. "While the Klan has lost much of its influence in recent years, it is still an active organisation, and it still strikes fear in the hearts of many citizens in Mississippi and elsewhere," prosecutor Paige Fitzgerald said in papers filed in court. One potential juror said one of her cousins was married to one of Mr Seale's cousins. "That makes me nervous, even though I don't know him personally," the woman said, nodding towards Mr Seale. Among 20 others dismissed from the initial jury pool of 76 was a young woman wearing a Confederate battle flag T-shirt. Mr Seale, who has denied Klan membership, faces up to life in jail if he is convicted. The case is the latest of more than a dozen civil rights-era cases prosecuted across the South since the early 1990s. Mr Seale and reputed fellow Klansman Charles Marcus Edwards were arrested in 1964 over the deaths, but the case was thrown out. The case was reopened in 2005 after years of lobbying by the brother of one of the victims. Mr Seale had been believed dead for years until Thomas Moore, 63, tracked him down in southern Mississippi while investigating the murders. Mr Edwards has been granted immunity and is expected to testify for the prosecution. Mr Seale's jail jumpsuit was topped by a bulletproof vest as he left the court.

Outside the headquarters hotel, members of the Simplified Spelling Society urged a complete rewrite of the English language, so that the "e" in the word "met" is also used in the words "said" "many" and "jeopardy." Inside, the adrenaline of 286 youngsters who range in age from 10 to 15 filled the hotel with exuberance. "I just want to be on TV," said Zina Ellis, of Moline, Ill. The 13-year-old's mother, Thea, confided that her daughter requested, if she were to win, $1,000 for shoes in different colors to go with every outfit. To get on television, contestants have to make it to the semifinals, which will be carried today on ESPN. To win, they'll have to get to the championship round, carried tonight by ABC. Alas, Ellis was eliminated in the fourth round, on the word "bracteolate" (she spelled it as "brachteolate"). Thanks to recent attention from Hollywood, interest in spelling and spelling bees has spiked, with this year's national contest attracting 10 million contestants. "Children want to be recognized," said Paige Kimball, the event's director and the 1981 champion. "All too often, children who prefer academics to athletics take a back seat." Sala Aouad, of Terre Haute, Ind., said her son Kennyi did not speak until he was 5. By then, he had been reading regularly, memorizing words. In the fourth grade, he entered a local spelling bee -- and lost. "Kennyi never likes to lose," she said. Now 11, he said he's excited at the chance to test himself against the best in the nation. "I like competition," Kennyi Aouad said. "It puts one's skills to the test." Aouad not only advanced to today's competition, but he brought down the house in the third round when confronted with the word "sardoodledom." His first reaction was to burst out laughing. The crowd in the 1,100-seat ballroom burst out laughing too. Every time the judge offered the word, the 11-year-old burst out laughing. With the clock running (contestants get two minutes and 30 seconds to spell the word from the time they hear it), he had to stop the giggles to spell the word. When he did so correctly, the crowd burst into applause. For much of its life, the Bee was a niche event. Then two things happened to change its complexion. In 1985, Balu Natarajan, a 13-year-old son of Indian-American parents, won by correctly spelling "milieu." He became an overnight sensation in his ethnic community, and many first-generation Americans came to see the contest as a passport to acceptance in U.S. culture, encouraging their kids to compete. Then, Hollywood discovered the contest. In 2002 the documentary "Spellbound" won an Oscar nomination, followed by a Broadway musical and last year's film "Akeelah and the Bee," which tracks a Los Angeles girl as she overcomes adversity to compete in the event. The contest also has attracted its share of writers. Myla Goldberg's 2000 novel "Bee Season" was made into a movie starring Richard Gere, and pop culture writer James Maguire wrote a book last year called "American Bee: The National Spelling Bee and the Culture of Word Nerds." But few in the lobby of the Grand Hyatt Hotel carried themselves like nerds. Clustered in groups, mostly with parents, sponsors of coaches, they checked their hair, worried about the competition and traded war stories about previous bees. Kunal Sah, of Green River, Utah, in his second National Spelling Bee, had a special mission. His parents, denied political asylum, have been deported to India while the 13-year-old lives with relatives in a motel and studies words. Hoping to win so he could spotlight his parents' plight, he said his goal was "to get to the top." The first-round written test has 25 questions, each worth one point, and the second-round oral words are worth three points each, for a total of 28 points. Contestants need 18 points to advance to the third round. Sah passed the verbal word -- "hurdle" -- with barely a hiccup. But he missed more than 10 questions on the written exam and will have to wait until next year. About the Real Cities Network About the McClatchy Company
http://www.insidebayarea.com/sanmateocountytimes/localnews/ci_6027408&cid Inside Bay Area - Giuliani meets the masses at eatery Letters to the Editor San Mateo County Times (From the last 24 hours) Father told son not to go into pool Shooting in East Oakland kills man, injures friend Cop-shooting suspect says he doesn't remember Whales assumed to have returned to ocean Livermore laser complex tops nuclear hit list Family: Cop killer was a troubled child, alcoholic Giuliani meets the masses at eatery By Aaron Kinney, STAFF WRITER Article Last Updated: 05/31/2007 02:45:50 AM PDT BURLINGAME &#151; Sandra Borrolaza heard about it on the morning news. Lindsay Caruso was shopping at a health food store on Broadway when she saw a commotion in front of Broadway Grill and walked over to check it out. At 11 a.m., both women were stationed in front of the restaurant, along with their babies, waiting to get a glimpse of former New York mayor and Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani, who was scheduled to show up at any minute. By that time, owner Nick Bovis had been at the restaurant for about an hour. He stopped by the table of "New York" Nick Fleres, a general contractor who eats at the grill four or five times a week, and told him to leave the seat next to him open, because Giuliani might be taking it. Bovis had first heard from Giuliani's campaign late last week. A campaign manager called and told him that Giuliani was "looking for a place he could come and meet regular people" before heading to a fundraiser at the Burlingame Hyatt, Bovis said. Campaign operatives in the Bay Area recommended the grill, which opened in December, in part because of its New York-centered theme and decor, said Giuliani spokesman Jarrod Agen. As 11 o'clock neared, Bovis positioned himself near the front door. By his feet was a framed, autographed photo of famed New York Yankee slugger Joe DiMaggio that he planned to present to Giuliani, a devoted Yankees fan. Bovis, who also owns Lefty O'Doul's in San Francisco,laughed and said he doesn't know much about politics, but Giuliani struck him as a "common-sense, middle-of-the-road" candidate. "If he can clean up New York, he can clean up the United States," he added. Giuliani stepped out of his car shortly after 11 a.m. and onto the Broadway sidewalk, where he was accosted by a scrum of reporters and cameramen. He assured them he'd speak to them after the event and made his way to the door, where Bovis greeted him. Bovis showed him the photo of DiMaggio once they were inside. "Oh, look at that!" Giuliani said, smiling and clapping his hands together. "It's beautiful. Thank you." Giuliani then made his way around the restaurant, shaking hands and signing autographs. Eventually, the candidate took a seat next to Fleres and several other customers at a table in the middle of the room, toasting them with a glass of orange juice. They talked about baseball, taxes, health care and children, Flores recalled afterward. "I think he's genuine," said Fleres, who grew up in New York City's Greenwich Village neighborhood. "He looks at you when he speaks (and he's) very bright and very poised." Giuliani supporters at the Grill said the mayor made a strong and favorable impression on them in the wake of the World Trade Center attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. "There's a safety about him," said Ana Cisneros, one of the managers of the restaurant, who was working as a United Airlines flight attendant on 9/11. "Something about him is just warm and genuine." Carlos Alferez, a pastor from San Jose who drove up for breakfast at Bovis' invitation, said he was eager to learn more about the candidate. "The most that I know about him is after the 9/11 (attacks) he really held the city together," said Alferez, seated across from his wife, Maxine. "And the people there really respected him." As Giuliani walked out of the grill, Borrolaza and Caruso positioned themselves along the sidewalk, hoping for an introduction. But the candidate was distracted by a well-wisher to his right and went by without seeing them. Giuliani took questions from reporters on the corner of Broadway and Capuchino Avenue, then turned around to find his car. This time the two mothers got his attention. He shook Borrolaza's hand, though he didn't notice 11-month-old Kasen, and moved on to Caruso, who held her 3-month-old son, Daniel, out for him to greet. "Of course I'll say hi to your kid," said Giuliani, bending down to give the child a kiss on the forehead. "Well, at least I got to shake his hand," said Borroloza after the Republican front-runner had gotten into his car. "Baby didn't get kissed, but he won't remember." "Danny, Danny!" Caruso explained to her son. "You got kissed by Mayor Giuliani!" Staff writer Aaron Kinney can be reached at (650) 348-4302 or Comment on this article by clicking on the link below.

A hurricane research team has renewed its forecast for an "above average" 2007 Atlantic storm season. REUTERS/Carlos Barria MIAMI (Reuters) - The Colorado State University hurricane research team renewed its forecast for an "above average" 2007 Atlantic storm season on Thursday and predicted 17 tropical storms, with nine growing to hurricane strength. Of those, five would grow into major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher with winds over 110 mph (177 kph), the team founded by forecast pioneer William Gray said in its revised forecast. The updated forecast issued on Thursday was unchanged from the team's April 3 forecast for the six-month storm season that starts on Friday. ADVERTISEMENT (article continues below) The researchers said there was a 74 percent chance that at least one major hurricane would hit the U.S. coastline in 2007, with a 50 percent chance that would happen on the U.S. Atlantic Coast and a 49 percent chance on the Gulf of Mexico coast. An average season brings 11 tropical storms, with six reaching hurricane wind speed of 74 mph (119 kph) and two growing into major hurricanes. Other private and government weather researchers have also predicted a more active season than average. But so far none have forecast anything like a repeat of record-breaking 2005, when 28 tropical storms spawned 15 hurricanes, including Katrina which flooded New Orleans and parts of the Gulf coast.

The South Florida Water Management District expected the record of 8.97 feet from May 24, 2001, to evaporate by Thursday as the region's worst known drought continues. The average water level should be around 13 feet this time of year in the second-largest freshwater lake in the contiguous United States. The 12,000-acre fire started Monday in the vegetation left to dry in the sun as waters receded from the lake's northwest rim, said Melissa Yunas, a spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Forestry. "All the water is not there. Now it's just vegetation, all dried out, just sitting on the side of the lake," Yunas said. The cause of the fire was unknown. It was about 50 percent contained, Yunas said. Lake Okeechobee is a backup drinking water source for millions of people in South Florida and the lifeblood of the Everglades. The region is largely dependent on the lake during dry periods, when it can be used as a reservoir. "The Everglades are also in a drought. We've totally lost the backup for the water supply for the east coast" of Florida, said Carol Wehle, executive director of the water management district. An above-average rainy season is needed to replenish the lake and South Florida's groundwater system, officials said. Only about 7-8 inches of rain have fallen on the region in the past five months, about half of normal totals. No significant rainfall was expected over the lake or the Kissimmee River valley to its north before Thursday night, according to the National Weather Service. The drought has forced stringent water restrictions on homes and businesses in 13 counties, and four coastal wells were closed to prevent saltwater contamination. The drought has allowed officials to begin clearing 500,000 cubic yards of rotted plant life and sediment from the southwest portion of the 730-square-mile lake to return its bottom to a more sandy base, improve water quality and restore wildlife habitat. Deep cracks cover the bottom of what should be five-feet deep Lake Okeechobe near Okeechobee, Fla. in this May 1, 2007 file photo. State water and wildlife managers are taking advantage of unprecedented drought conditions by removing life-choking muck along Lake Okeechobee's shoreline. The 500,000 cubic yards of rotted, dead plant life and sediment will be trucked from the southwest portion of the lake starting Thursday, May 23, 2007, to pastures for disposal. Its removal over several months will return the lake's bottom along its shoreline in that area to a more natural sandy base and create clearer water and better habitat for plants and wildlife.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/0-6&fd=R&url=http://www.knoxnews.com/kns/politics/article/0,1406,KNS_356_5563105,00.html&cid=1116814215&ei=muxeRqKEDZGoqwPX6vjNDQ Thompson interest likely to become official Thompson expected to affirm run for president soon; others offer support By TOM HUMPHREY, tomhumphrey3@aol.com NASHVILLE - As Fred Thompson wades into presidential waters, operatives for prospective opponents are already researching his Tennessee background, fans are considering trips to the Iowa caucuses, and the state's Democratic governor is saying he should run. The actor and former U.S. senator has made it increasingly clear that he intends to run, basically saying so in an interview reported Wednesday after spreading word in national media that he will form a presidential committee by next week. He may follow up with an official announcement in Nashville around July 4. Also Wednesday, Thompson asked to be released from his role of playing a prosecutor on the TV series "Law & Order." The show's executive producer, Dick Wolf, said Thompson told him he "has not made a firm decision about his political future" but that he was concerned about "the creative and scheduling constraints of the upcoming season." Should Thompson, 64, choose Tennessee as an announcement site and decide to locate the "Friends of Fred Thompson" campaign headquarters here, as reported, the move would mark something of a homecoming for a politician gone but far from forgotten in his native state. There's been some quiet grumbling, however, that Thompson has occasionally seemed uninterested in Tennessee. As state Democratic Party chairman Gray Sasser is quick to point out, Thompson no longer lives in Tennessee and is registered to vote in Virginia. In fact, he will be speaking to Virginia Republicans on Saturday while former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney addresses the "Statesman's Dinner," the biggest event of the year for the Tennessee Republican Party. The Romney address was booked months ago, before Thompson took his unannounced-but-interested stance. That stance, Thompson told USA Today in an interview reported Wednesday on the newspaper's Web site, "has allowed me to be in the hunt, so to speak, without spending a dime." "I can't remember exactly the point that I said, 'I'm going to run,' " Thompson said in the interview. "But when I did, the thing that occurred to me: 'I'm going to tell people that I am thinking about it and see what kind of reaction I get to it.' " The Romney speech to Tennessee Republicans creates "a little bit of a ticklish situation," said Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, who is the official chairman of the Statesman's Dinner and, like virtually all state Republicans, an ardent Thompson supporter. "His career may have taken him out of the state, but his heart is still in Tennessee," said Ramsey of Thompson. "We all know that." Tennessee was considered an open state to Republican presidential candidates after former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist declared he would not seek the nomination. Other Republican candidates made forays into the state, though Romney had arguably made the earliest headway. If Thompson officially gets into the race, Republicans agreed Tennessee will almost certainly become solid Thompson turf. Tennessee's presidential primary is now scheduled for Feb. 5, a date when many other states also will be voting, including California and New York. Thompson's entry would likely cross Tennessee off the list of places to visit for all others in the race, several said. Two Tennessee GOP lawmakers, Reps. Marsha Blackburn of Brentwood and John J. Duncan Jr. of Knoxville, had announced earlier that they backed Romney for the party presidential nomination. They have switched allegiance to Thompson. One of the state's key GOP financial figures, businessman Ted Welch of Nashville, has so far stuck by his early commitment to Romney. But most Tennessee Republican notables strike stances similar to that of state House Republican Leader Jason Mumpower, who declared, "I will do anything under the sun to help Fred Thompson be the next president of the United States. "I'll go to New Hampshire, I'll go to Iowa, I'll go anywhere, and I'll foot my own bill," Mumpower said. The Iowa caucuses are Jan. 14, with the New Hampshire primary eight days later. Several prominent Tennessee Republicans, including former Sen. Howard Baker, Frist and Rep. Zach Wamp of Chattanooga, have played key roles in the "draft Thompson" effort. The former senator's eldest son, Fred D. "Tony" Thompson Jr., who works as a lobbyist at the state Legislature, said his father is "taking the next step in the natural progression of things" by "testing the waters" in moving to set up a committee allowing him to raise money for a campaign. The younger Thompson declined to confirm reports that his father would make a formal announcement July 4 in Nashville. Asked where he would be for that holiday, he said, "I plan to be with my family." Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, was asked about a prospective Thompson candidacy Wednesday. "I certainly think Fred Thompson is the kind of person who ought to be stepping forward and making himself available for this," said Bredesen, describing Thompson as "a fine, estimable man." "I am a Democrat, obviously, and barring some disaster in my party, I'll probably be supporting the Democratic nominee. But he's a fine fellow and would be a great addition to the field," Bredesen said. Tom Humphrey may be reached at 615-242-7782. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Boeing subsidiary accused of aiding CIA torture flights By Henry Weinstein, Los Angeles Times | LOS ANGELES -- The American Civil Liberties Union announced yesterday that it will sue a subsidiary, alleging that the company helped the Central Intelligence Agency with "the forced disappearance, torture, and inhumane treatment" of three men the government suspected of terrorist involvement. "This is the first time we are accusing a blue-chip American company of profiting from torture," said ACLU lawyer Ben Wizner, who spoke about the case, filed in federal court in San Jose, Calif., at a news conference in New York. Since at least 2001, Jeppesen Dataplan Inc., of San Jose, "has provided direct and substantial services to the United States for its so-called 'extraordinary rendition' program, enabling the clandestine and forcible transportation of suspects to secret overseas detention facilities where they are placed beyond the reach of the law and subjected to torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment," the suit alleges. A spokesman for Jeppesen said: "There isn't really anything I can say with the exception that I am aware of the suit. We have not been served. I can't talk specifics about any customers that we might have or the services we might provide for them." "Publicly available records demonstrate that Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret rendition flights over a four-year period to countries where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused in contravention of universally accepted legal standards," the suit states. Jeppesen provided flight and logistical support services to aircraft and crew used in the rendition program "to unlawfully render plaintiffs to detention and interrogation in Morocco, Egypt, and Afghanistan," adds the suit brought on behalf of three men. They are Binyam Mohammed, a British resident who was taken into custody in Pakistan and is being held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station in Cuba; Abou Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen, who was first apprehended in Pakistan and is being held in Morocco; and Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian citizen, who while seeking asylum in Sweden was arrested by Swedish security police, handed over to CIA agents, shackled, drugged, and flown from Stockholm to Cairo, according to the suit. ACLU lawyers, including the organization's executive director, Anthony Romero, said they had obtained information about the rendition program from a variety of sources, including investigations in Spain and Sweden and media reports, in particular an article by Jane Mayer in The New Yorker on Oct. 30. Mayer wrote that a former Jeppesen employee told her that at a company board meeting a senior Jeppesen official stated: "We do all of the extraordinary rendition flights -- you know, the torture flights." &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Washington, May 30, 2007 Immigration officials said on Tuesday they will proceed with plans to double the cost of applying to become a US citizen and triple the fee for seeking legal permanent residency. The fee increases will take effect July 30. Citizenship fees will rise from $330 (â¬244) to $595 (â¬440), plus $80 (â¬59) for required electronic fingerprints, an increase of $10 (â¬7.40). For legal permanent residency and fingerprints the cost will be $1,010 (â¬748) for those over 14. The cost now is $325 (â¬241). Officials with Citizenship and Immigration Services, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, said the increases are needed to improve service, hire 1,500 workers, improve offices, equipment and systems to process applications. "This agency is fee based, 99 per cent of our budget comes from user fees. We need to be the agency people expect us to be. We need to undertake reforms .... The only way to get from there to here is to have the financial resources to do that," CIS Director Emilio Gonzalez said Tuesday. Many immigration groups and some Democratic members of Congress have protested the fee increases, saying they will put citizenship and legal immigration out of reach of many immigrants. They also question whether better service will follow. The new fees were to be published this week in the Federal Register and also were posted on the CIS Web site.

Skip ads and navigation Last updated May 30, 2007 9:43 p.m. PT Presidential hopefuls campaign in Calif. Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani, center, toast with a glass of orange juice with supporter Mike DeMaria, right, during a visit to Broadway Grill in Burlingame, Calif., Wednesday, May 30, 2007.(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) BURLINGAME, Calif. -- Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday declared that California's early primary has made the state more than a political ATM - just as he accepted a check from a supporter and then headed to two fundraisers. California's Feb. 5 presidential primary seemed to be having a modest effect, with several major candidates blending their fundraising chores with campaign stops to greet potential voters. Mostly, however, the focus was on fundraising. Democrats John Edwards and Hillary Rodham Clinton also trolled the nation's most delegate-rich state for cash and votes Wednesday. Between them, the three candidates held six California money events. Edwards, during an appearance between the four fundraisers he is holding over two days, decried the influence of money on politics and called for public financing of campaigns. "I'm not holier-than-thou about this. I've raised millions of dollars in 2004 and now to run for president," he added. "But that doesn't mean I think the system is good, because I don't." Giuliani stepped off a plane at San Francisco International Airport and promptly went to the Broadway Grill a few minutes away to chat with customers. His campaign ensured the lunchtime visit was stacked with supporters, sending out an e-mail Wednesday morning urging them to stop by the cafe en route to the fundraiser. Those crowded into the restaurant appeared to be a mix of regulars in T-shirts and committed supporters clad in suits and ties and bound for the fundraiser, which cost $250 and up. George Yerby handed the candidate a check for $200 on the spot. Giuliani hastily passed it to an aide. "He's going to be the next president," Yerby, 67, who lives in the wealthy Bay area enclave of Hillsborough, said afterward. "I hope." Giuliani closed his fundraisers here and in Beverly Hills to the public and news media. The restaurant stop, where he sipped orange juice and coffee, was open. He acknowledged to reporters outside the grill that raising money "has always been a big focus in California, like it was in New York." "One of the complaints that New Yorkers have had, and that Californians have had, is 'They come here, they take our money, but they don't campaign here.'," he said. "So now, they're going to get both - they're going to get us coming here and trying to get your money, but also coming here and campaigning." California is one of 15 states to move its primary to Feb. 5, and others are considering it. Its primary for state candidates will remain in June 2008. Giuliani promised to return regularly if he captures the GOP presidential nomination. "I think I'm the one Republican candidate who has a legitimate chance of winning California. That's based on the polls," he said. A Field Poll of California voters in March suggested otherwise. It showed GOP rival Sen. John McCain running stronger against Edwards and Clinton in hypothetical head-to-head matchups. McCain and Giuliani trailed Democratic candidate Barack Obama by identical margins, and also were behind Clinton and Edwards. Edwards headlined a fundraiser in San Francisco on Wednesday, headed to a second one Wednesday evening in the Bay area suburb of Atherton and planned two more Thursday. During an appearance at the headquarters of search-engine leader Google, Edwards said the current system of paying for campaigns is "dysfunctional." "The way we finance political campaigns in this country, it couldn't be more unhealthy," Edwards told about 1,000 Google employees. He called for taxpayer-financed campaigns - the only way, he said, to "literally pull the life out of these big groups - people that have a huge presence in Washington, lobbying groups." The former senator from North Carolina was the fourth presidential candidate to submit to questioning by executives and staffers of Google. Clinton, meanwhile, held two fundraisers in the Los Angeles area, one hosted by director Steven Spielberg.

In an energetic defence of the proposed law soon to be debated in the Senate, Bush rejected critics who are calling the legislation an amnesty for illegal immigrants, and said kicking them out of the country is "simply unrealistic." "If you want to scare the American people, what you say is, 'The bill's an amnesty bill.' "It's not an amnesty bill. That's empty political rhetoric trying to frighten our fellow citizens," Bush yesterday said in southern Georgia at a training centre for government security officials. "Amnesty is forgiveness for being here without any penalties," he said. "This bill is not an amnesty bill." "I'm deeply concerned about America losing its soul," Bush told the McClatchy newspaper chain in an interview. "Immigration has been the lifeblood of a lot of our country's history," Bush said. "I am worried that a backlash to newcomers would cause our country to lose its great capacity to assimilate newcomers," he told the news service. The bill, which was introduced in the Senate last week, could eventually allow most of the estimated 12 million undocumented workers in the United States to gain legal status, in the most sweeping immigration law reform in 21 years.

Zoellick, 53, will succeed Paul Wolfowitz who steps down by the end of next month, following a scandal in which he was found to have broken the rules in arranging a pay rise for his girl friend and bank employee, Shaha Riza. President Bush named Zoellick as World Bank President as indications emerged that the United States may be alarmed at the expanding military capability of the People&#39;s Republic of China and how it might be used, in a report released by the office of the Secretary of Defense. Although Bush announced his decision yesterday, Zoellick&#39;s selection must be approved by the Bank&#39;s 24-member board. Reports say the administration hopes the new nominee will receive acceptance from the board and other countries as well. In a statement, the White House extolled the qualities of its new nominee thus: "Bob Zoellick has had a long and distinguished career in diplomacy and development economics. "It has prepared him well for this new assignment. He is a committed internationalist. He has earned the trust and support of leaders from every region of the world." The statement further said Zoellick "is deeply devoted to the mission of the World Bank. He wants to help struggling nations defeat poverty, to grow their economies, and offer their people the hope of a better life. Bob Zoellick is deeply committed to this cause." In response, Zoellick said that it would "be an honor to help lead this key institution and to work with the many fine professionals from all over the world who are dedicated to overcoming poverty and creating opportunity." He thanked the President for the confidence placed in him. His words: "Thank you, Mr. President for the confidence you&#39;ve always placed in me, and for the strong support you&#39;ve continually offered. Your vision of public service is to strive for great goals, and with your help, I&#39;ll do my best." The executive directors of the poverty fighting institution had Tuesday outlined key qualities that are required of the next president to include a "track record of leadership, experience managing large, international organizations, a familiarity with the public sector and a willingness to tackle governance reform, a firm commitment to development, a commitment to and appreciation for multilateral cooperation and political objectivity and independence. While Zoellick&#39;s name was not mentioned by the Board, the statement however noted that "as the selection process gets underway, the Board expects an intensive process of formal and informal consultation with the Executive Directors on potential nominees, adding that "the Executive Director for the United States has informed them that the United States will be nominating a candidate." If he is approved, Zoellick will be faced with the daunting challenge of rebuilding trust and confidence in the World Bank, which had been eroded during the Wolfowitz saga. Worried by the reaction of stakeholders and international donors, the special panel that investigated the pay rise issue had urged the executive directors to consider whether Wolfowitz was fit to continue in his post as President, in the light of revelations that he broke the rules. Bush&#39;s new nominee has said he looks forward to working with the team of professionals at the Bank, to meet with contributors and borrowers as well as listen to different perspectives on how the Bank can achieve its goals. Zoellick also said that if his nomination is approved, he would work closely with the Bank&#39;s "dedicated and talented staff." During his tenure as US trade representative, Zoellick is reputed to have completed negotiations that brought China and Taiwan into the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in addition to enacting and completing Free Trade Agreements with Singapore, Morocco, Chile and Australia. His record also states that he completed FTAs with five nations of Central America and the Dominican Republic, as well as with Bahrain; worked with Congress to enact the Jordan FTA and the Vietnam Trade Agreement. International Organizations and Africa Under Bush&#39;s administration, Zoellick served with Secretary of State James A. Baker, III, as Under Secretary of State for Economic and Agricultural Affairs, as well as Counselor to the Department(Under Secretary rank). Meanwhile, in the summary of the report titled "Annual Report to Congress: Military Power of the People&#39;s Republic of China 2007," the office of the US Secretary of Defense notes that China is undergoing a military transformation and has the greatest potential to compete with the US. "China&#39;s ability to sustain military power at a distance, at present, remains limited but, as noted in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review Report, it has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States and field disruptive military technologies that could over time offset traditional US military advantages," says the report.

The highest previous death toll in Iraq for Fort Lewis soldiers was nine in December 2004. Staff Sgt. Thomas M. McFall, 36, of Glendora, Calif., and Pfc. Junior Cedeno Sanchez, 20, of Miami, died Monday when an improvised explosive device went off near them during a foot patrol in Baghdad, the Pentagon said. Pfc. Charles B. Hester, 23, of Cataldo, Idaho, died two days earlier in Baghdad when the vehicle he was riding in struck another IED, the Pentagon said. McFall and Sanchez were infantrymen assigned to 1st Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division (Stryker Brigade Combat Team). Hester was an infantryman assigned to the other Fort Lewis-based Stryker brigade serving in and around Baghdad, 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. The two brigades represent about 8,000 soldiers serving in and around Baghdad who, along with other Army combat units and Iraqi security forces, are trying to rid the region of insurgents and quell sectarian violence. Command Sgt. Maj. Gerald Williams, who is serving on an interim basis as the posts senior noncommissioned officer, said losing a soldier never is easy, and the Army post grieves with news of each death. The soldiers commitment to continue the fight hasnt wavered and morale remains high, he added. We stand together with each other to make a difference every day, Williams said. McFall joined the Army in October 1994 and served tours in South Korea and Afghanistan. He reported to Fort Lewis for a second time in September 2005. His wife, Emily, said her husband loved listening to classic rock and cooking ribs on the grill. He would tell peers leaving the military that the Army was the easiest job in the world, she said. He loved the brotherhood and his heart beat red, white and blue; there was only one exit, Emily McFall said. Hester and Sanchez were serving in their first combat deployments. Hester enlisted in May 2004 and arrived at Fort Lewis that September, and Sanchez joined Nov. 9, 2005, and came to the Army post in June 2006. Family members for both soldiers couldnt be reached for comment. Today, Fort Lewis will hold a memorial service for Sgt. Iosiwo Uruo, a 27-year-old native of Guam, who died May 24 when his unit came under enemy fire. His will be among the final individual memorial services for soldiers at Fort Lewis. In a May 22 memo obtained by United for Peace Pierce County, Brig. Gen. William Troy, Fort Lewis acting commanding general, wrote that the number of fallen soldiers prevents post officials from conducting individual services. He directed the posts senior chaplain to draft a policy set to take effect next month. Fort Lewis plans to hold a memorial service once a month for its fallen soldiers. The details are still being worked out, Fort Lewis spokesman Joe Piek said. He noted that four services typically are held to honor a fallen soldier. The soldiers unit holds one in theater; a second at the Army post for the greater community that family members sometimes attend; the third organized by family in the soldiers hometown; and the fourth a burial with military honors.
